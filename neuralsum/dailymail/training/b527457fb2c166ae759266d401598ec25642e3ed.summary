new @entity1 manager @entity0 is set to offer @entity2 a move in january , unless the @entity5 captain agrees a new deal at @entity7			1
@entity2 also has a number of options to move to the @entity10 next summer with @entity13 one potential avenue for the 34 - year - old midfielder			1
but the @entity15 understands that a move to @entity17 could be very appealing			1
@entity2 ( right ) is yet to be offered a new deal at @entity5 and could leave @entity7 @entity0 may try to tempt the @entity5 captain to move to @entity1 @entity0 was unveiled as @entity1 's new manager at the clubs como training ground on saturday as revealed in the @entity15 three weeks ago , @entity22 faces the sack from @entity24 at the end of the season			1
but it is @entity29 boss @entity28 who is top of the short list to replace him at the @entity33 , not @entity35 manager @entity34			1
my @entity37 contacts tell me that @entity39 would rather manage @entity40 down the line rather than @entity24			1
@entity34 will see out his contract at @entity35 , which runs until the summer of 2016 , and , unless there is a dramatic turn of events in @entity47 , the @entity33 hierarchy will not wait that long			1
@entity22 is facing the sack from @entity24 at the end of the season @entity29 manager @entity28 is among the favourites to replace @entity22 at city @entity34 wants to see out his contract with @entity35 , and he would prefer @entity40 over @entity24 @entity54 will sell @entity55 so he can fully purchase @entity58 side @entity56			1
but the @entity55 owner 's £ 300million asking price is being questioned by brokers , who value the club at a maximum of £ 100m			1
@entity54 will sell @entity55 to complete his full purchase of @entity56 mon : @entity65 has a point when he says that booing your own team mid game is hardly going to inspire			1
but one can understand the frustration of @entity72 fans and @entity65 is hardly in a position to complain about people being fickle			2
tue : @entity75 suggests captaincy for club and country could weigh @entity79 down			2
wed : @entity79 says even if he ends up with 200 caps and 200 goals he will never be a football legend like @entity75			2
at last , some reality in @entity85			2
thur : @entity87 ' investigation ' into allegations of awarding 2018 @entity89 to @entity90 and 2022 to @entity91 is published and instantly becomes parody when @entity10 based chief investigator @entity93 condemns his airbrushed report			0
it would seem the only way to bring down @entity97 and his regime is for the @entity99 and the @entity100 to move in			2
fri : after losing at home to @entity102 , @entity104 sack manager @entity103			1
that 's how tough they are on the continent			0
libero : it was a privilege to be in the company of @entity111 brokers at the @entity113 insurance football club annual dinner at the @entity114 in @entity115 on thursday			0
not least because i was able to re-engage with my greatest boyhood hero			0
no not @entity118 , who was on the top table , but @entity120			0
that said , ex-ref @entity122 stole the night with is his self - effacing after - dinner speech			0
the crowd , who initially booed @entity122 , whooped in applause when he said his three sons are called @entity79 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
i am hearing : @entity129 are set to make a bid for @entity132 striker @entity131			1
i am also hearing : the real money behind @entity72 , owner @entity134 , is asking questions about club chairman @entity136			0
@entity79 ’s quest to surpass @entity75 's @entity139 goalscoring record of 49 could be usurped			0
as it stands , there is currently a ' marksman ' who is alongside @entity143 on 48 who will continue indefinitely			0
@entity129 are lining up a move for @entity132 's @entity149 striker @entity131 @entity151 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity152 was further proof of how they are growing in stature under the patriotic leadership of @entity157			1
given the nationalist fervour that will swirl around @entity159 on tuesday like a @entity161 mist , @entity139 could be in for a torrid time			0
coral offer 2 - 1 for a @entity151 win			2
@entity164 it was a great goal by @entity166 for @entity151 in their 1 - 0 @entity168 qualifier win over the @entity170 at @entity159 on friday			0
but it still does n't compare to @entity173 ’s strike against @entity174 at the 1978 @entity89 in @entity175			0
. @entity166 scored the winner for @entity151 in their @entity168 qualifying win over @entity170			0
