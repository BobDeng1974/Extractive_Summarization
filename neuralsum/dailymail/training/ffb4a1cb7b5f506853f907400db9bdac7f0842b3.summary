@entity0 has reveal new details of its plan to send humans to an asteroid by 2025 and @entity5 in the 2030s			1
the space agency was recently given the go - ahead for a mission to redirect an asteroid into the moon ’s orbit , land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to @entity5			1
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity32 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload			2
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			0
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			0
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			0
@entity0 ’s top human exploration chief has revealed to a @entity47 panel plans for a manned mission @entity5 in the 2030s are on track			1
development of key components of the deep - space rocket , capsule and infrastructure needed to reach @entity5 are already underway - and today @entity0 was given the go - ahead for a mission to land on an asteroid as part of a ' stepping stone ' to @entity5			1
' our next step is deep space , where @entity0 will send a robotic mission to capture and redirect an asteroid to orbit the moon , ' @entity0 said today			1
' astronauts aboard the @entity70 spacecraft will explore the asteroid in the 2020s , returning to @entity73 with samples			2
' this experience in human spaceflight beyond low - earth orbit will help @entity0 test new systems and capabilities , such as @entity81 , which we ’ll need to send cargo as part of human missions to @entity5			1
' a @entity87 subcommittee recently approved an authorization bill that would allow @entity0 to redirect an asteroid into the moon ’s orbit , land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to @entity5			1
' beginning in @entity98 , @entity0 ’s powerful @entity32 rocket will enable these “ proving ground ” missions to test new capabilities , ' @entity0 said			1
' human missions to @entity5 will rely on @entity70 and an evolved version of @entity32 that will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever flown			1
' how it compares : the sls is larger than the @entity106 rockets than launched man to the @entity108			0
it will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today			0
@entity112 's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled			0
however construction of the first stage of @entity112 's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway the agency will now have to spell out the cost and details of the mission as part of an exploration ' roadmap ' to @entity5 that @entity0 will have to submit to @entity122			1
the approval came as associate @entity0 administrator @entity124 told members of a @entity126 that the agency remains on target to launch an uncrewed mission in 2017 to test the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) rocket and @entity70 multi-purpose crew vehicle that will carry astronauts to @entity5			1
avionics testing of solid rocket boosters was completed this week at @entity135 in preparation for a test of the @entity32 rocket later this year , and acoustic testing is also underway			1
' there is real hardware in manufacture for the path to @entity5 , ' @entity124 told senators			2
' our architecture is designed for long - term human exploration of our solar system , including the goal of human missions to @entity5			2
' the hearing , called ' from here to @entity5 , ' outlined intermediate space missions being planned as steps toward long - duration space travel			1
' with the technologies and techniques we develop , we will enable expeditions to multiple destinations , ultimately allowing us to pioneer @entity5 and other destinations as we lay the groundwork for permanent human settlements in the solar system , ' @entity124 said			0
@entity0 would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide			0
they would then tow or push it towards @entity73 so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			0
in 2021 astronauts would then use an @entity70 - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			2
this asteroid would also , probably in the 2030s , be used as a stop - off point for astronauts on their way to @entity5			1
exact details on how @entity0 plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known , but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag			0
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity70			2
after the @entity70 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			0
once the @entity70 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			0
after the mission is complete , @entity70 returns to @entity73 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity211 – 10 days later , as seen in the video			0
one planned mission is to a near - @entity73 asteroid , @entity124 said			0
' @entity0 will employ @entity32 and @entity70 for an early human exploration mission to perform pioneering human operations further from the @entity73 than ever before , rendezvousing with and returning samples from an asteroid redirected to at stable orbit around the @entity108 by the robotic segment of the @entity221 ( @entity221 ) , ' he explained			1
' we 're going to grab a piece of the solar system , we 're going to deflect it around the moon and insert it into a distant retrograde orbit around the moon where our crews can go visit , " he said			0
' to think we 're moving a piece of the solar system for our use that will allow us to learn skills and techniques that we need to push the human presence into the solar system , that 's a pretty awe - inspiring statement			0
' however , the ambitious @entity5 mission could be delayed or derailed if funding from a budget - conscious @entity122 continues to erode , or if other countries ’ plans for a lunar mission force the @entity245 to change course for security reasons .			2

giant deep space @entity32 rocket already being built
small missions would lead to first manned mission to @entity5 in 2030s
asteroid will be used as a base to send astronauts to @entity5
