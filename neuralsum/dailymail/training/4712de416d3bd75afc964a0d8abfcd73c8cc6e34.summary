by @entity0 published : 00:26 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 08:44 est , 13 december 2012 the @entity2 government had elaborate plans set up for a ‘ full nuclear response ’ against @entity5 and the @entity6 in the height of the @entity8 , it was revealed wednesday			1
a previously unreleased top - secret document shows that there was a full line of emergency nuclear weapons to be used if the president was killed , went missing , or if @entity2 came under siege			1
the blitz was to be carried out , no questions asked , even if an attack was unintentional			0
however , president @entity19 changed the policy in october of 1968 , as a means of reducing the insurmountable risks that came with full - blown nuclear warfare			1
drastic measures : president @entity19 , pictured with key advisers , in the @entity26 in 1967 ; newly - released documents reveal their dramatic nuclear plan ready for action : prior to 1968 , the @entity2 could have launched a no - questions - asked attack ; here , a communications worker at the systems counsel of the @entity35 the documents were released for the first time by the @entity38 , and show the drastic measures the @entity2 was willing to take in the event of attack			1
advice : @entity19 , who was president from 1963 - 1969 , was told by advisers that ' @entity42 ' was highly dangerous according to the once - classified documents , which were released from the @entity38 of @entity44 , the pre- 1968 @entity2 had a simple plan if they were attacked – release a ‘ full nuclear response			1
’ the document did not discriminate – the former @entity49 and @entity5 were to be attacked instantaneously , regardless if an attack on their end was accidental or even their fault , according to @entity53			2
that meant that if the @entity6 attacked the @entity2 , they were mandated to retaliate against not only the @entity49 , but @entity5 as well , with a full nuclear strike			2
on october 14 , 1968 , @entity19 and his cabinet discussed the idea of releasing nuclear weapons in the case that the president was killed or went missing , and was meant to be a last resort in preventing the breakdown of the chain of command , code - named ‘ @entity42			1
’ the meeting took place during the last month of @entity19 ’s presidency , which the research institute notes is unusual , as it is unclear why @entity19 waited so long to stop the dangerous operation			0
@entity72 , a political theorist in on the meeting , called a change in @entity42 ‘ essential			0
’ he said : ‘ this was dangerous			0
’ general @entity78 chimed in : ‘ all the @entity79 and commanders have been consulted			0
’ for @entity83 eyes only : the document , dated october 14 , 1968 , dramatically changed ' @entity42 ' @entity85 : a nuclear test explosion , ' @entity87 , ' on 25 may 1953 in @entity88 the document , with an ‘ eyes only for the president ’ disclaimer , was released last month as part of a @entity95 appeal			1
they were released nine years after the initial request			0
president @entity98 in 2010 released his own nuclear strategy , saying that he was narrowing how the @entity2 would use nuclear weapons			2
he said in a statement that ‘ outliers like @entity105 and @entity106 ’ and other countries that have violated nuclear sanctions would be exceptions to @entity2 - borne nuclear attack			0
the president also said : ‘ we are going to want to make sure that we can continue to move towards less emphasis on nuclear weapons to make sure that our conventional weapons capability is an effective deterrent in all but the most extreme circumstances			0

classified plan , code - named ' @entity42 , ' *allowed* @entity2 to use nuclear weapons on @entity49 and @entity5 , even if they were *n't* responsible for attack
*furtherance* could be invoked if the president was killed or went missing
policy was dramatically changed on october 14 , 1968
