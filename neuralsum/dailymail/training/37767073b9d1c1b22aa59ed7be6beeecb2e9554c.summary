by @entity1 reporter published : 12:07 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 19 august 2013 a four - year - old boy was allegedly beaten to death with a belt by his mother and step - father after a computer glitch at the @entity9 failed to pick up abuse claims against them , it has emerged			1
@entity12 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , died in december 2011 with rib fractures , lacerations to his liver and bowels , needle punctures , brain swelling and bruises and welts that looked as if he had been beaten with a belt , doctors said			1
@entity26 's younger brother , who was then three , was also admitted to hospital with liver abrasions and bruises to his body but survived			1
he is now in protective custody			2
their mother , @entity34 , 25 , and her boyfriend , @entity35 , 23 , have been charged with child abuse , child neglect and murder and are due in court for a preliminary hearing on monday			2
victim : four - year - old @entity42 was beaten to death in december 2011 even though the @entity9 in @entity14 had received numerous calls about potential abuse it has now emerged that the @entity9 had received calls about the family , but that a glitch in the computer system meant staff did not connect the cases , the @entity46 reported			1
in the weeks before @entity26 's death , the @entity9 received at least three claims of child abuse from family and pre-school teachers - with one noting his bruises and saying the ' situation is escalating '			1
but one child abuse report made on november 11 , 2011 was given to one caseworker , while two further reports made on december 7 and december 8 were given to a different worker			1
it meant that the two caseworkers were unaware of the other calls or that the family was already under investigation ; if they had known , there could have been swifter actions , the paper noted			1
accused : his mother , @entity34 , and her boyfriend , @entity35 , were arrested after the death @entity9 records point out that there were ' technical challenges ' with the $ 27 million data system , the @entity77 and @entity78 or @entity79			2
' the @entity79 system , for some reason , did not make the connection when the reports came in , ' read the records			0
' with the volume of referrals that are assigned on a daily basis there were no opportunities to make the connection			0
' the records also show that some entries showing the department 's investigation of the family were not entered into the system until five months after the boy 's death - rather than the 30 days required			0
spokesman @entity98 told the paper that some records show that staff had been meeting with law enforcement and prosecutors , who were deciding whether to go ahead with criminal charges			0
@entity79 , which was created in august 2010 , underwent a $ 4 million system upgrade after legal advocates complained its problems had reached a ' crisis ' stage			0
hurt : @entity42 's little brother @entity111 also suffered lacerations and bruising but survived other issues included failures to issue payments for foster families or being unable to track child deaths			1
children 's rights noted there had been significant improvements earlier this year			0
@entity121 and @entity35 will appear in court on monday to hear if they will be tried separately			0
@entity26 's biological father is now seeking custody of his surviving son			0
his attorney , @entity127 , said : ' i am very disappointed by how this case has been handled by @entity9			1
people look to @entity9 for protection for children			2
if policies had been adhered to , this situation may have ended differently			0
' @entity121 's attorney said she was a caring mother who did not harm her children .			0

@entity42 died of blunt force trauma in december 2011
his brother , then 3 , was also hospitalized but survived
@entity9 computer glitch meant complaints of abuse were not linked so caseworkers did not realize the *severity* of the case
