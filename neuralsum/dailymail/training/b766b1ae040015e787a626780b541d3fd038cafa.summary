by the end of her life , there was a chasm between me and my adored mother that was really rather sad			2
we visited each other ’s worlds , bewildered tourists both , before scuttling back to what each believed to be the ‘ sanity ’ of her own			2
for worlds apart is what we were			2
my mother was clever , no doubt about it ; at 14 she won a scholarship for a further education that her family could neither afford her to take nor imagine to be useful			2
so she worked - courageously , too : as operator of the @entity26 air raid sirens , she could not take shelter as the bombs rained down			2
but she stopped work altogether when she married , kept kith and kin together and dallied with women of similarly mundane lives over coffee mornings and afternoon teas			1
rings true : @entity37 can identify with the points made in the book @entity40 for me , just one generation later , further education was a birthright			1
nobody was surprised that my sister and i went to university in the @entity47 , then into law and the media respectively			2
which places us , we now learn , in a history - making elite : the @entity54 women			1
the title comes from a groundbreaking new book by @entity57 , @entity40 — how working women are creating a @entity59 , in which she describes this elite as the 15 per cent of women who are graduate professionals , high achievers and top earners ; the women who live to work against the 85 per cent who work to live , if they work at all			1
and these ‘ alpha women ’ are finding more in common with men like themselves than with less accomplished members of their own sex — thus creating a yawning gap between two different classes of women			1
to which i can only say to @entity57 : what took you so long ? more than a mother : @entity37 is proud to be a grandmother to @entity79 , pictured , but she does n't let these roles define her at last , somebody has noticed what i have felt all along : that there are easily 85 per cent of women in this country with whom i have nothing in common — and i count my mother among them			1
this book explains what i have always known — that , to women like me , most other women ’s lives and conversational topics are dreary , cliched and uninteresting			1
even as a teenager , i never understood the bonding girl thing			1
the sleepovers , where you spent the evening painting each other ’s toenails in somebody ’s ( usually pink ) bedroom			2
so instead , i hung around with boys who would become alpha men			2
together we smoked and argued about @entity106			2
when the boys became young men , i still sought their company			1
not because i wanted to be a man , but because i wanted what men had			2
and , by and large , i got it			0
time in male company taught me that my intellect and abilities were as good as theirs			1
so it figured that if i put in the hours that they did , i was entitled to the same rewards			0
and if others were too stupid or too idle , well , lock them in their pink bedrooms			0
' for us @entity54 women , children do not define you in the way that other achievements do ' kind ? no. honest ? yes			1
but i ’ve largely kept my opinions to myself since then			0
why ? because the @entity47 brought the myth of ‘ sisterhood ’ : that we women all had more in common with each other than with men			1
that we were victims , standing united against the male oppressor			1
the movement believed itself progressive			0
in fact , it harked back to my mother ’s coffee mornings and afternoon teas when it did n’t really matter who attended , for what they had in common ( home , husbands , wombs , children , boredom ) outranked all else			0
it was a silly , insidious notion that grew to a corralling of women that has continued since : ‘ sisters under the skin ’ , we are basically all the same			1
how often do you hear phrases that lump us all together , like ‘ from a woman ’s point of view ’ ? we similarly lump together ‘ women ’s forums ’ , the most renowned being @entity164 ’s @entity163 : woe betide she ( i.e. , me ) who admits to finding much of it utterly alien			1
i might feel vaguely sorry for the plight of a woman from the low - achieving 85 per cent			0
but you can not possibly expect me to feel closer to a migrant @entity173 charlady of 30 just because we both have mammary bumps on our chests , than i do to a man of my own age , education , income and class			0
i do , of course , have many female friends			0
but i have none who is not an xx woman ; not a graduate and not in paid work			1
many of my friends have children , but for us xx women , children do not define you in the way that other achievements do			1
for example , without question , i take greater pride and joy in my daughter and my granddaughter than in anything i have achieved professionally			0
outside the sisterhood : @entity37 has never understood how women bond over coffee mornings and make - up and yet i would be astonished to be introduced as , ‘ @entity37 — she has a daughter , you know , ’ rather than , ‘ @entity37 — she ’s a writer , you know ’			1
i have met women from the other side of the yawning gap who attempt to define themselves by their domestic skills but , for me at least , it simply does n’t work			1
one , @entity218 , is so proud of her blessed fruit cake that she speaks of it as her signature achievement			0
once , she tried to teach me how to make it			0
first , apparently , you soak the raisins in brandy for six weeks … but i quickly lost track			0
i ’m simply not interested			0
much like my teenage conviction that make - up is a small pleasure not a night out , so i think that cake is a sweetmeat , not a conversation			0
' i believe i am a woman with a life fully lived , who has never , ever wasted time on a coffee morning ' all of this , and much more , is the stuff of @entity57 ’s liberating book : at last , ruthlessly exposing the feminist myth of ‘ sisterhood ’ , here is a woman who says that , yes , these days , there are two kinds of women			1
furthermore , you do n’t have to feel guilty if you ’ve made it to xx factor status ; there ’s a lot that we xx women get right			1
we lose our virginity later than the 85 per cent — research shows that @entity257 girls who go on to become graduates are less than half as likely to have underage sex as those who do not			0
we marry and we marry for keeps ; our divorce rate is the lowest among women			1
we marry our own : contrary to popular belief , @entity54 women do not marry men who become ‘ house husbands ’			1
such creatures are few and the arrangements usually unsuccessful			0
@entity54 women have fewer children , with 40 per cent choosing to have none			1
but when they do have them , they spend more time with their children than the women who work less			2
astounding ? only at first thought			0
@entity276 ’s findings are that although @entity279 women spend more time under the same roof as their children , that includes time while the children are left playing video games in another room			2
and before we all burst into a chorus of ‘ i do n’t know how she does it ’ , there are clues : @entity279 woman pays for housework to be done and is much more likely to take the family out to eat , so saving valuable time			0
she also watches only a third as much television and sleeps an hour less , every night , than the low - achieving 85 per cent			0
so i ’m proud to be an xx woman			0
unlike the majority of my sex , i believe i am a woman with a life fully lived , who has never , ever wasted time on a coffee morning			0
in fact , if you visit my home , you ’ll not find tea or coffee there at all			0
i do n’t keep it , i do n’t drink it and never have ; even the smell makes me queasy			0
i think it must remind me of something			0

@entity57 ***'s*** @entity40 is about ' elite ' women
they are graduate professionals , high achievers and top earners
@entity322 believes she falls into the category
she ***'s*** always *preferred* male company
she ***'s*** never understood the interests of ' less accomplished ' women
