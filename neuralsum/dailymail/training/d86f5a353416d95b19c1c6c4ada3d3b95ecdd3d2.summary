@entity1 ’s @entity0 is set to get a makeover - and the changes could see the personal assistant app being fitted in your home			1
the firm recently won a patent that would see the personal assistant app interacting with sensors in different rooms of a house , tracking you as you move around , before carrying out relevant tasks			1
for example , if @entity0 knows the time and knows you ’re in the front room near a tv , it could remind you to watch your favourite shows			2
@entity1 recently won a patent that could see @entity0 interacting with sensors in the home			1
for example , people who take medicine regularly could be reminded to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning , or with their main meal in the kitchen at night			1
an example process is pictured the patent , details a system in which @entity1 ’s personal assistant @entity0 would be used to interact with sensors around a person ’s home			1
for example , people who take medicine regularly could be reminded to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning			1
if @entity0 knows the time and knows a homeowner is in their the front room , it could reminder them to watch their favourite shows			2
outside of the home , other examples include the assistant being used to : ' assist individuals who are impaired in some way , including elderly people , and surgeons , whose eyes , hands and brains are constantly busy when performing operations			0
' although the patent does n’t explicitly say what the sensors would consist of , signals could be taken from web - enabled devices already in the home , or bought separately			2
future versions , in theory , could reverse the process and be used to control devices or the sensors using @entity0			0
alternatively , people who take medicine regularly could be given a nudge to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning , or with their main meal in the kitchen at night			1
@entity1 ’s patent calls the home assistant an ‘ active ontology ’			1
ontology is a term used in computer science to describe a system of ' tasks being carried out using a variety of knowledge bases			0
' although the patent does n’t explicitly say what the sensors would consist of , signals could be taken from web - enabled devices already in the home , or be bought separately			2
the patent , originally uncovered by @entity1 , said the assistant would be ' in communication with a plurality of sensors distributed throughout the domain and adapted to convey observed facts relating to the user 's behaviour ( e.g. , ‘ the user is in the kitchen ’ ; ‘ the user is in the dining room ’ ; ‘ the user is in the bathroom ’ )			1
another example could be when homeowners go on holiday			0
@entity0 would begin by waking them up , or advising how long it will take them to get to the airport , based on current traffic reports			0
it would scan the calendar to find flight times , and once the owner is detected near the front door using a sensor , it would remind the homeowner to remember their passport or other documents before they leave			0
although the patent does n't explicitly say what the sensors would consist of , signals could be taken from web - enabled devices already in the home , or bought separately			0
future versions , in theory , could reverse the process and be used to control devices or the sensors using @entity0 , stock image pictured future versions , in theory , could reverse the process and be used to control devices or the sensors using @entity0			0
the patent , called 8,677,377 : method and apparatus for building an intelligent automated assistant , was published by the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) on tuesday			2
outside of the home , the patented said : ‘ such systems may assist individuals who are impaired in some way ( e.g. , visually , auditorially , physically , cognitively , etc. ) , including elderly people , who may be stricken by one or more ailments [ and ] surgeons , whose eyes , hands and brains are constantly busy when performing operations , among others			0
' as with all patents , the technology may never be released , or may change or adapt before it is turned into reality .			0

patent was filed by the @entity145 on tuesday
it details a system in which @entity1 ’s @entity0 app would be used in the home
sensors placed in rooms would interact with the personal assistant app
these sensors would tell the app which room a homeowner is in
it would then perform a relevant task , using other *software* signals
for example , people who take medicine regularly could be reminded to take their pills each time they enter the bathroom in the morning
