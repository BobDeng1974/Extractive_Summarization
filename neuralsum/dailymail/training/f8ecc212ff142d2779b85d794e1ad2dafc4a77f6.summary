by @entity0 most people enjoy a game of @entity3 in the kitchen on a rainy sunday afternoon , but these @entity6 farmers decided to play the big game - by knocking down a silo			2
the video starts as the man has knocked down nearly half of the concrete panels , and the demolition process is near an end			1
the construction , which appears to be a concrete stave silo , would previously have been used to store grains or food for livestock			0
the man behind the camera can be heard shouting that he has never ' dropped ' a silo before , and the ensuing near - death experience proves it			0
seconds later , the man with the hammer whacks away the last bearing panel , and has to run for his life as the entire concrete tower comes down from above			0
bringing down the house : when the video begins , the man had already taken down a significant portion of the silo 's panels let 's play @entity3 ! the unidentified man swings a sledgehammer and whacks away at the concrete panels on a silo getting there : the man takes the concrete panels down one by one to see which one will be the final ' straw ' for the silo timber ! as the man lifts the sledgehammer to hit again , the silo begins to give way time to run : the man drops his hammer as he realises that his life is at stake if he stays put smash and dash : the man comes up to the cameraman as he runs from the falling silo and the debris coming off it destruction : although their project carried a high risk , it can not be argued that it is an effective way to bring down a silo hammertime : as the dust settles the men look out over the debris , high - five and congratulate themselves on a job well done , before agreeing it is probably best ' not to tell @entity70 '			1
