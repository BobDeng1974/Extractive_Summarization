top poker player @entity0 , who is fighting a @entity2 casino for £ 7.7million ' winnings ' , has told the @entity4 his integrity is more important to him than a big win			1
the 38 - year - old @entity7 , who lives in @entity8 , is suing over a version of baccarat known as @entity11 which he played at @entity13 in @entity14 over two days in august 2012			1
after four sessions , mr @entity0 was told the money would be wired to him and he left for the @entity7 , but it never arrived , although his stake money of £ 1 million was returned			1
@entity0 ( pictured left ) , who is fighting a @entity2 casino for £ 7.7million ' winnings ' , has told the @entity4 his integrity is more important to him than a big win			1
he told the court that he was accompanied at @entity13 by a friend of his , @entity22 ( right ) , who he called by her @entity24 name ' @entity26 ' @entity28 @entity27 , which owns @entity13 , says the technique of ' edge - sorting ' which mr @entity0 used - which aims to provide the customer with an element of ' first card advantage ' - is not a legitimate strategy and that the casino has no liability to him			1
it claims that mr @entity0 's conduct defeated the essential premise of the game of baccarat so there was no gaming contract			1
in court today he described himself as a professional gambler whose job it was to seek lawfully to reduce the perceived ' house edge ' - which gives a casino an advantage in games perceived to be of unequal chance , like baccarat			2
mr @entity0 , described on the @entity55 website as ' arguably the best poker player in the world ' , said : ' i consider that i would not be doing my job very well if i did not seek to use to my benefit weaknesses that i identify in the way that casinos set up or offer particular casino games			2
' i use a variety of strategies whilst playing in casinos			0
no system is fail - safe and each time i play i risk failing to execute the strategy properly - some of these are very complex or difficult to execute - which usually results in me losing a lot of money			0
' i consider all the strategies i use to be lawful and i would never cheat in a casino			0
it is not in my nature to cheat and nor would i risk my reputation by acting unlawfully in any manner			1
' mr @entity81 , hearing the action in @entity2 , has been told by mr @entity0 's counsel , @entity84 , that the casino 's case was ' plainly unsustainable '			1
he said that edge - sorting involves nothing more than using information available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards the casino chooses to use and making requests of the house - which it could accept or refuse - on the manner in which play is conducted			1
the 38 - year - old @entity7 , who lives in @entity8 , is suing over a version of baccarat known as @entity11 which he played at @entity13 ( pictured ) in @entity14 over two days in august 2012 ' moreover , it is very easy for the casino to protect itself against the technique , not least by checking the cards for asymmetrical patterns before they are used in play , by not re-using the same cards after a shoe ( the receptacle holding the decks ) has been played , and by the elementary step of turning some of the cards once between shoes			1
' mr @entity0 said that successful play in most casino games is about gaining a lawful edge over the house by using all information available to players and being able to play for long enough to make it count			2
' this is what i always look to do			0
many gamblers , professional or otherwise , often believe they have an advantage or edge when in reality they do not , usually because they have failed to execute their strategy properly or because they have got their mathematics wrong from the start			0
' he said he was known in the gaming industry as an ' advantage player ' and cheating is anathema to players like him			0
' we observe the unwritten doctrine : how do i find a legal way to beat the house ? any method that could amount to cheating would breach the doctrine and cause you to be ostracised by your fellow players - we are all very careful to stay the right side of the line and we discuss advantage play strategies at length			2
' he said that like many professional gamblers , he is superstitious , which makes him like to play in certain conditions - such as asking friends or casino staff to leave the table if he is losing or gets a bad feeling about someone , requesting a change of dealers , tables or cards and shuffling the cards mid-shoe			0
' gambling and superstition go hand - in - hand			0
i guess it is human nature to look for patterns in life to try and bring order to events which we ca n't explain			0
' mr @entity0 said he was very angry when he heard the casino would not be paying out his winnings : ' i was upset as i had played an honest game and won fairly			1
mr @entity0 ( pictured left outside court and right in action during the @entity178 ) told the @entity4 : ' it is not in my nature to cheat and nor would i risk my reputation by acting unlawfully in any manner ' ' i am highly successful in my job as a poker player and professional gambler and i would never do anything to risk my reputation			1
' my integrity is infinitely more important to me than a big win , which is why i have brought these proceedings to demonstrate that i have been unjustly treated			0
' mr @entity0 said he was accompanied at @entity13 by a friend of his , @entity22 , who he called by her @entity24 name ' @entity26 '			2
she was a professional gambler and advantage player and , when they were introduced in early 2012 , she told him about the advantage strategy she had been using successfully in baccarat - edge sorting			1
he said : ' she explained to me how a large number of casinos used cards with asymmetrical reverses - normally because they were defective and the casinos were sloppy in not checking the cards properly before use - and how she was able at times to use this asymmetry to gain an advantage over the house			0
' he added : ' in 2012 , prior to playing at @entity209 , @entity26 and i had edge sorted in @entity211 and @entity212			0
' we won substantial sums of money doing so and we also lost substantial sums along the way when we got the strategy wrong or were not able to execute the sorts because of effective casino game protection methods			0
' at all times when edge sorting , i considered that @entity26 and i were playing lawfully and it never occurred to me that edge sorting could ever be viewed as an unlawful strategy			2
i continue to believe that it is lawful			0

@entity0 is suing @entity2 casino @entity13 for his £ 7.7m ' winnings '
the @entity7 played a form of baccarat cards at @entity237 in 2012
mr @entity0 used technique of ' edge - sorting ' which provides customer with element of ' first card advantage '
he was told the money would be wired to him but only his stake of £ *1m* was returned , @entity4 told
@entity248 says his conduct defeated premise of the game and constituted cheating
mr @entity0 's lawyer *insists* ' edge sorting ' is a legal technique his client had used elsewhere
tells court it is ' not in my nature to cheat and nor would i risk my reputation by acting unlawfully in any manner '
