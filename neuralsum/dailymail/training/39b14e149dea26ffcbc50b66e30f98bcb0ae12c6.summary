@entity0 has issued tough new guidelines on research using its system following outrage from users over experiments on the social network			2
the firm today tightened its research guidelines following uproar over its disclosure this summer that it allowed researchers to manipulate users ' feeds to see if their moods could be changed			1
at issue was study in which @entity0 allowed researchers to manipulate the content that appeared in the main section , or ' news feed , ' of small fraction of the social network 's users			0
during that time , negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users , to see if it generated a more positive response			1
the @entity27 - based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012			1
during that time , negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users , to see if it generated a more positive response			1
posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word			1
the experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500			1
according to @entity0 , nobody 's posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up on some feeds			2
it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts			1
‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the researchers			1
during the weeklong study in january 2012 , data - scientists were trying to collect evidence to prove their thesis that people 's moods could spread like an ' emotional contagion ' depending on what they were reading			1
' although this subject matter was important to research , we were unprepared for the reaction the paper received when it was published and have taken to heart the comments and criticism , ' @entity65 , @entity0 's chief technology officer , wrote in a blog post			0
' it is clear now that there are things we should have done differently			0
' in the past three months , @entity65 said , @entity0 has given researchers clearer guidelines on research procedures and has created an internal panel that will review projects			0
but there will not be an external review process and @entity0 will continue to encourage researchers to study how people use its site			0
' we believe in research , because it helps us build a better @entity0 , ' @entity65 wrote			0
' like most companies today , our products are built based on extensive research , experimentation and testing			0
' ‘ the reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of @entity0 and the people that use our product , ' @entity0 data scientist @entity96 said at the time of the study			0
‘ we felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out			2
the experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500			2
‘ at the same time , we were concerned that exposure to friends ' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting @entity0			0
we did n't clearly state our motivations in the paper			0
' having written and designed this experiment myself , i can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone			0
' during the experiment , @entity0 deprioritised content in @entity124 , based on whether there was an emotional word in the post			2
tests affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500 - for a week , in early 2012			1
according to @entity96 , nobody 's posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up on some feeds			2
' those posts were always visible on friends ' timelines , and could have shown up on subsequent @entity137 loads			0
' it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts , according to the results of a study published in @entity147 .			1
