by @entity0 last updated at 10:34 pm on 14th october 2011 rising profits : the dark yellow net margin line on this graph spikes from august this year upwards , with @entity4 predicting that suppliers ' margins will level out more next year if fuel bills and prices remain the same profit margins at the ‘ big six ’ energy firms have leapt more than 700 per cent as millions worry about keeping warm this winter			1
the average amount of profit per customer has risen from £ 15 a year to £ 125 in just a few months , according to the industry regulator @entity4			1
the increase is a result of inflation - busting price rises that have pushed up the average annual dual fuel bill by 15 per cent , or £ 175 , to a record high of £ 1,345			1
most of this rise , £ 110 , has gone straight into the profits of @entity25 ( @entity26 ) , @entity27 , npower , @entity29 and @entity30			0
the increase – challenged by the power firms – will infuriate families and pensioners struggling to cope with the biggest cost of living squeeze for at least 60 years			2
charities and consumer groups fear an increasing number will have to make a nightmare choice this winter between heating and eating			0
some 4.5million households are in fuel poverty , which means they may have to ration their heating this winter			1
however , bills are predicted to rise another 25 per cent over the next four years , taking one in four households – 7.25million – into fuel poverty			1
customers will be hit by a ‘ double whammy ’ of having to pay for expensive imported gas and a £ 200billion programme to switch to wind , wave , solar and nuclear power to meet @entity60 green targets			0
families can protect themselves and make savings of as much as £ 300 a year by switching energy suppliers			1
however , many have been deterred because they do not understand tariffs or trust the energy firms			1
yesterday @entity4 announced a radical shake - up designed to simplify the complex array of 400 tariffs that make it virtually impossible to find the cheapest deal			1
energy firms blamed the price increases on increased dependance on importand and rising wholesale costs figures from @entity4 show the rise in suppliers ' profit margins , as well as the corresponding price hike in fuel bills to over £ 1300 for customers in future there will be a uniform standing charge and simple unit costs for electricity and gas to help people make comparisons			1
@entity93 , chief executive of the official customer body @entity95 , said news of the increased profits would ‘ deepen the mistrust that consumers feel toward their suppliers ’			2
with around 400 tariffs available , @entity4 said most consumers view the energy market as overly complex and hard to @entity103 hopes that by forcing suppliers to provide a standard no - frills tariff , consumers will be able to make more informed choices about their energy @entity107 is a breakdown of its tariff reform proposals , which the regulator hopes could be implemented by next winter : each supplier can only have one standard tariff per payment method , per fuel			1
the three payment methods are direct debit , pre-payment meter and standard credit , such as credit cards and cheques			0
consumers will get a simple unit price and a fixed standing charge set by @entity4 - enabling them to choose the cheapest standard tariff more easily			1
the regulator hopes this will enable households to tell at a glance whether they can save money by switching supplier or moving to a new deal			2
all other tariffs must have a specified end date and fixed terms and conditions			0
with these " innovative " tariffs , there will be no restrictions on the number , type , structure or duration of fixed term contracts , including exit penalties			0
automatic rollover at the end of the contract will be banned			0
customers who do not sign up to a new deal when their fixed term contract ends will default to the standard tariff			0
they will also be free to switch			0
@entity4 wants all energy prices to be displayed in pounds and pence , for example ' £ / month ' as well as ' p / kwh '			1
its research shows that consumers can relate better to information presented this way			0
it will be the equivalent of an ' apr ' comparison for gas and electricity			0
suppliers will have to publish the price of all their tariffs in the same way so consumers can compare between standard and fixed term tariffs			1
this will ensure greater transparency			0
energy firm profit margins fluctuate depending on the price they pay for wholesale gas and electricity , coupled with other business costs , versus the retail price charged to customers			1
generally , the retail price is high enough to guarantee a profit			0
occasionally , wholesale prices rise so high that , for a short time , the energy firms make a loss per customer			1
however , overall the wholesale cost of gas and electricity has risen by around 20 per cent since 2008 , but the price charged to customers has leapt by 60 per cent			0
profits at @entity25 , the @entity189 ’s biggest supplier , soared by around a quarter in 2010 to a record £ 742million			0
the firm claims the figure will be down this year			0
its managing director , @entity193 , insisted @entity4 ’s numbers were wrong			2
‘ we are working hard to keep bills as low as possible for all our customers , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity4 ’s report is misleading			2
’ @entity200 , of @entity189 , which speaks for the big suppliers , also dismissed @entity4 ’s profit margin figures			1
‘ a snapshot of profits every few months does not provide a realistic picture of the average profits over a year , ’ she said			0
‘ energy companies do need to make a profit as they are investing billions each year			0
’ energy secretary @entity210 has called a summit of industry leaders , consumer groups and regulators for monday to find ways to help customers this winter			2
which ? executive director @entity218 said : ' we think a simple format should be applied across all tariffs , so that people can compare the full range of energy deals at a glance			2
' rising utility bills helped push consumer price inflation up to 4.5 % in august and are forecast to send it close to , or even above , 5 % as all of the recently - announced increases come into effect			0
@entity30 was the first of the major groups to raise prices when it put gas tariffs up by 19 % and its electricity charges by 10 % from august 1			2
market leader @entity25 increased gas bills by 18 % and electricity by 16 % in august , while in september @entity242 and @entity243 raised electricity by 11 % and gas by 18 % , along with @entity27 , which increased its electricity prices by 11.4 % and gas by 18.1 %			2
@entity248 raised gas prices by 15.7 % and electricity by 7.2 % from october 1 , while price rises of 15.4 % for gas and 4.5 % for electricity come into effect for @entity29 customers on november 10			1
an undercover investigation by consumer group which ? recently revealed that even staff at energy firms are confused by the dizzying amount of tariffs offered by suppliers			1
energy firms were found to be providing customers with incorrect information about the number of tariffs available and are being kept in the dark about the best deals , undercover research has found			1
suppliers have already started to move to address some of @entity4 's concerns			1
earlier this week , @entity242 & @entity271 announced plans to sell all of the electricity it generates on the open market , compared with the regulator 's proposals that 20 % of all supplies must be auctioned by 2013 .			2
