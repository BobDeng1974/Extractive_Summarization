patients should receive healthcare statements every year telling them how much they have cost the @entity3 in a bid to clamp down on time - wasters , a report says			1
the ‘ bill ’ would list the number of times they had visited their gp , @entity10 and outpatient clinics over the past 12 months and , where possible , the cost of these services			1
it could compare their usage to the average patient in their local area – highlighting to frequent visitors where they might be using services unnecessarily			1
the report , how much do we use the @entity3 , co-authored by @entity41 mp @entity40 , said the estimated annual cost of unnecessary or missed appointments was £ 1billion			0
it said the healthcare statements would be ‘ simple and transparent ’ and had the ‘ potential to save the @entity3 hundreds of millions of pounds every year by encouraging users to change their behaviour and to take greater personal responsibility ’			1
however , the statements would not be used as an attempt to introduce the public to private healthcare , the authors said , insisting that ‘ political and public opposition to charging for @entity3 services remains strong ’			1
it is estimated that the cost of a @entity9 appointment ranges from between £ 10 and £ 25 , while attendance at @entity10 is more than £ 100 a visit and more in the case of admission to hospital			2
but many of appointments could be avoided , it is claimed			0
according to @entity69 , 51million people every year visit their gp with minor problems which would clear up by themselves or through use of an over-the counter remedy			2
' awareness ' : the report , co-authored by @entity41 mp @entity40 , said the estimated annual cost of unnecessary or missed appointments was £ 1billion these include as many as 40,000 gp visits a year for dandruff , 20,000 for travel sickness and 5.2million for blocked noses			2
the report , which was co-written by @entity83 , chairman of the @entity84 , said : ‘ as with an annual bank , @entity87 or pension statement , each individual user of the @entity3 would receive a @entity89 every year			0
‘ the user would be able to see what services they had received over the past 12 months and the cost of those services to the @entity3			0
‘ where the same or similar service could be provided less expensively – say by visiting their gp rather than @entity10 – they might also be able to see the savings to be made			1
’ the statements could include the number of visits to a hospital or gp practice , the basic cost of these services , the number of missed appointments and the cost of this to the @entity3 and information highlighting potentially unnecessary visits			1
mr @entity40 , a member of the @entity113 and mp for @entity115 and @entity116 , said any costs of collating data across different health bodies and posting out the statements would be out - weighed by the savings made			2
he said the ‘ tax ’ statements meant patients would see themselves more as customers rather than recipients , making them aware of the true cost of the services of doctors and nurses			1
he said : ‘ this is not a matter of charging people			0
this is about raising awareness of where people are not using the @entity3 effectively			0
‘ for example , if they are repeatedly visiting their @entity10 department where they could be getting exactly service at a lower cost by visiting their gp			1
‘ or where people are repeatedly missing appointments			0
‘ the bill might say you have visited your gp seven times , missed three appointments and been to @entity10 four times in a year			1
‘ your doctor could ask you to bring in your healthcare statement to see how many times you have visited different services and discuss this			0
‘ if people are frequent users or unnecessary users , they would be able to see a pattern of behaviour			0
’ the report suggested that the scheme would have to undergo thorough trials before being rolled out nationwide			0
it added : ‘ in addition in end - of - life contexts special care will have to be taken to prevent patients from seeing themselves as burdens on their families or on the @entity3 if cost information is included			2

' @entity174 ' would list patients ' visits to their gp , @entity10 and outpatient clinics
it could compare their usage to the average patient in their local area
the study said the statements would help patients ‘ understand the costs ’
