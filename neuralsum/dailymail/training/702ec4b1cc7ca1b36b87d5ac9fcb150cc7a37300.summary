by @entity0 published : 20:25 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 03:25 est , 26 september 2013 downloadable games that encourage children to spend parents ' cash to proceed are being probed by the @entity5 video games that pressure children into spending hundreds of pounds when playing online face a crackdown from the @entity5			1
many computer , console and mobile phone games offer players the opportunity to buy extra lives or abilities when online			2
it has led to many parents being left with huge credit card or mobile phone bills			0
now an @entity5 investigation has found children are particularly vulnerable because they could feel they are letting other players down if they do not buy the content			1
many games also blurred the distinction between spending virtual currency and real money and used statements or images to encourage children to make a purchase			1
the investigation found some games included ‘ potentially unfair and aggressive commercial practices to which children may be particularly susceptible ’			2
now the @entity5 has proposed payments made by children while playing games online will not be deemed authorised , and should not be taken , unless the account holder - such as a parent - has given their informed consent			1
and they state that consumers should be told upfront about potential costs for playing the games , and any other important information such as whether their personal details will be shared with third parties			2
but @entity47 , founder of @entity48 , has criticised the @entity5 proposals as ‘ flaccid ’			1
he said : ‘ when games like @entity53 and others charge £ 69 a pop for children to buy “ gems ” , there is something almost sinister happening			1
‘ many of these free games take advantage of children ’s confusion between virtual and real money and some parents ’ technical illiteracy			1
‘ the @entity5 consultation is flaccid - the problems are apparent and games makers and app stores need to be held to account			1
children can unknowingly run up bills of hundreds playing games that have been downloaded for ' free ' ‘ we need rules that stop bait pricing on games predominantly marketed or targeted at children : wealth warnings both at the start of games and inside app stores to indicate it is an in - app purchase game , and caps put on how much can be spent on such purchases within an hour , which can only be removed by the cardholder			1
’ the @entity5 launched its investigation in april following concerns that users could run up substantial costs paying for content such as upgraded membership or virtual currency in forms including coins , gems or fruit			1
typically , players can access only certain areas of these games for free and must pay for higher levels or features			1
@entity5 executive director @entity101 said : ‘ this is a new and innovative industry that has grown very rapidly in recent years , but it needs to ensure it is treating consumers fairly and that children are protected			1
‘ the way the sector has worked with us since we launched our investigation is encouraging , and we ’ve already seen some positive changes to its practices			0
' these principles provide a clear benchmark for how games makers should be operating			2
once they are finalised , we will expect the industry to follow them , or risk enforcement action			0
‘ in the meantime , we want to hear what parents , consumer groups , industry and anyone else with an interest thinks about our principles before we finalise them later this year			0
‘ this is a global industry so we ’re also sharing our principles with our enforcement partners worldwide with the goal of achieving some common international standards			0
’ @entity131 , chief executive of @entity132 , said the guidelines need to be enforced			0
she said : ‘ the scandal of online games which try to pressure or trick players into making extra purchases must end			2
we ’ve seen parents turning to us after their children inadvertently run up huge bills for downloads , so we welcome the @entity5 ’s moves to clamp down on the practice			1
‘ after an unexpected £ 200 bill landed on his doormat , one of our clients assumed he ’d been the victim of fraud			0
but after approaching his bank , he was told that the bill was in fact down to a game his 10 - year - old son enjoyed playing			0
' he was shocked to be told that as the extra costs were laid out in the small print , the only way to get his money back would be to sue his son			0
‘ it ’s good to see that the @entity5 are considering action to make games include clear information on costs , and require authorisation for the account holder before children can make in - app purchases			1
' the final rules must be backed up by strong enforcement action to ensure that consumers are properly protected			0
’ a spokesman at the @entity172 said : ‘ we welcome the @entity5 ’s investigation into this very important issue			1
the government is committed to ensuring that consumers , and particularly children , are properly protected			0
‘ we will be studying the @entity5 findings and proposed remedies and will be interested to see how the industry responds			2
’ credit crunch : @entity183 , 6 , unwittingly racked up a £ 2,000 bill on his grandfather 's credit card playing @entity187 ( pictured ) schoolboy @entity183 , 6 , unwittingly racked up a £ 2,000 credit card bill playing an online game on his grandfather ’s @entity190			2
the little boy was innocently playing the popular children ’s video game @entity187 until his grandfather @entity195 , 55 , was contacted by the fraud squad last year			0
the family was unaware of little @entity183 ’s huge spending spree until his grandmother tried to use the credit card at @entity201 , only to have it declined			0
when the fraud squad contacted mr @entity195 , of @entity204 , @entity205 , he was horrified to discover the bill spent on the app. tiny monsters is a ‘ breeding ’ game where gamers collect and create monsters to fill their virtual island			0
while the game is free to download the app has ' premium currency ' which gamers can buy using real money			0
using his grandfather ’s @entity219 password , @entity183 bought virtual food and coins costing up to £ 70 each while playing different levels on the game to reach the @entity225 .			0

many ' free ' games encourage youngsters to spend cash on upgrades
parent *soften* do *n't* realise what is happening until it 's too late
now the @entity5 is pushing for a new *system* to *overcome* the problem
