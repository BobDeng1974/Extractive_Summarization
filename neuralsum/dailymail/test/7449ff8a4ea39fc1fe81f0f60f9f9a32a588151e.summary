instead of enjoying a conventional honeymoon after his wedding on saturday @entity3 will be heading to @entity4 next week for a training block that has now taken on a much increased significance			1
for in the wake of @entity9 's announcement that she is pregnant , the world no 3 's trial with his prospective assistant coach @entity12 has assumed a greater importance			1
@entity9 , who is to give birth some time in august , will be around eight months ' pregnant during @entity16 this summer , which is not finishing until july 12 due to the new three week gap between @entity19 and @entity16			1
@entity3 celebrates taking a set against @entity21 in the final of the @entity23 the @entity25 no 1 is set to marry his long - term girlfriend @entity26 in @entity27 on saturday therefore @entity12 is likely to have a key part to play as @entity3 attempts to regain his title at @entity30 – something which , given his improved form during the first part of the season and his prowess on grass , is well within his reach this year			1
beyond that the 43 year - old @entity38 may also come into his own , as it is unclear how this will affect @entity9 's 26 week per year commitment to the @entity43 , which is almost exclusively spent on the road			2
she also has the part - time job of being captain of the @entity51 @entity50 team , who are in action next weekend			0
@entity9 has never made any secret of the fact that the travel is the part of the job that least appeals to her , and that will inevitably become more complicated with a baby on board			0
already it must be very questionable whether she would be at the @entity64 which begins at the end of the august , although there has been no comment on this from either her or @entity3 , who has been up in @entity69 ahead of tying the knot with @entity26 in @entity27			1
@entity3 's current coach @entity9 has recently announced that she is expecting a baby @entity9 , pictured at this year 's @entity73 , may have to alter her coaching schedule after the birth it is understood that the 27 year - old @entity43 has known about @entity9 ' s pregnancy for a number of weeks , but he was anyway planning on linking up with @entity12 – the former world singles no 4 and doubles no 1 – prior to that			1
as @entity81 reported as far back as nearly a year ago , the @entity38 was on @entity3 's shortlist to replace @entity83 before he settled on the former @entity16 women 's champion as part of a groundbreaking move			0
a personable and intelligent man still actively involved in the game , and as someone who made the absolute best of his natural ability , he was someone the @entity43 identified as prime coaching material			0
@entity3 has been planning to work with former world no 3 @entity12 as an assistant coach the @entity38 , pictured winning @entity16 with @entity96 , is a former world no 1 doubles player last week in @entity99 reported that the two of them had recently spent two hours on the phone together , and he has not been able to join up before because he has been involved with @entity38 's version of @entity104			1
' the time flew by , ' the @entity25 no 1 said of their highly satisfactory conversation			2
it would be a major surprise if they somehow did not get along , or if he did not fit in with others in the team , including @entity9			0
just where this leaves the player and his 35 year - old head coach will be for the two of them to work out			0
the softly - spoken @entity9 is a very private person who prefers to keep a low profile on the tennis side of things , let alone on matters to do with her personal life			2
@entity12 could have a key part to play in @entity3 's quest to reclaim the @entity16 title he won in 2013 she is known to have been accompanied by a girlfriend on trips with @entity3 to @entity130 and @entity131 this year , who stays in the background to the point where she has been near enough invisible			1
however pleased @entity3 will be for his coach on a personal basis – and there is no question they have become very close – he might also feel that the last thing he needs is any further complication or upheaval within his support team			2
his form has been good this year after all the disruptions and departures of last season , and @entity12 appeared to be the last piece slotting into place			0
now the @entity38 could find himself with a bigger role than was initially bargained for .			0

@entity3 is getting married to long - term girlfriend @entity26
coach @entity9 recently announced that she is pregnant
@entity25 no 1 is considering taking on @entity12 as assistant coach
