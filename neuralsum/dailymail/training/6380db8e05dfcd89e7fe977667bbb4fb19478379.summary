executed : @entity0 lost his appeal against execution amid claims he was denied his rights under the @entity5 a @entity7 official said that the @entity8 was in breach of international law when they put @entity0 to death in a prison in @entity14 last night			1
the 38 - year - old @entity16 citizen was executed by lethal injection for raping and bludgeoning @entity18 , 16 , to death with a 40 - pound chunk of asphalt			1
@entity7 @entity23 @entity22 said @entity25 's execution ' raises particular legal concerns ' , including whether he had access to consular services and a fair trial			1
@entity22 also cited a 2004 @entity31 ruling saying the @entity8 must review and reconsider the cases of 51 @entity16 nationals sentenced to death , including @entity35 's			1
he claims this never happened			0
in his last statement before he died , @entity25 apologized to the victim 's family and asked for their forgiveness , according to @entity43			0
he said : ' i truly am sorry			0
let 's get this show on the road			0
' one more thing : @entity50 , @entity51 ' @entity14 executed @entity35 despite objections from president @entity54 's administration that the action would violate international treaty obligations and put @entity8 citizens abroad at risk			1
the high court 's 5 - 4 decision was a setback for the administration			2
prayers : relatives and friends of @entity35 take part in a mass to try to stop his execution in @entity71 , hours before the @entity8 @entity64 rejected an appeal shrine : @entity25 's family display a collection of childhood photographs of the convicted killer on an altar at his aunt and uncle 's house in @entity50 while there were few who doubted his guilt , @entity0 's lawyers said he was not given the chance to contact the @entity16 consul which was his right under the @entity5			1
the @entity89 also fear that his execution could affect @entity8 diplomatic interests			1
governor of @entity14 , @entity92 , had already rejected appeals to stop the execution from former president @entity95 as well as diplomats , judges , senior military officers and the @entity7			1
before the @entity64 ruling came through a spokesman said the governor had no plans to halt the execution and the @entity14 attorney general 's office has urged the @entity64 not to intervene			2
@entity25 made the 45 - mile trip to the @entity106 of the @entity107 from death row at the @entity109 , just outside @entity110			2
appeal : the @entity54 administration was keen to stop the execution believing it could be detrimental to international relations and affect the treatment of @entity8 arrested abroad @entity0 asked for : prison officials described him as calm			1
@entity25 's final meal request included fried chicken , tacos , fried okra and a bowl of @entity123			0
he selected a sister , one of his attorneys and three friends to witness his lethal injection			0
also scheduled to witness are two friends of the father of his victim , 16 - year - old @entity18 of @entity132			0
@entity25 was convicted in 1994 of raping the girl before bludgeoning her to death with a ' 30 to 40 - pound ' piece of asphalt rock ' roughly twice the size of the victim 's skull ' in @entity132 @entity14			1
' there was a gaping hole from the corner of the victim 's right eye extending to the centre of her head from which blood was oozing , ' court documents read			0
' the victim 's head was splattered with blood			0
' @entity14 authorities failed to tell @entity25 , who was born in @entity50 and has lived in the @entity8 since the age of two , that under the @entity155 convention he was entitled to contact the @entity16 consulate when he was arrested			2
@entity14 governor @entity92 brushed aside appeals from the @entity7 and top diplomats to stay @entity161 's execution @entity25 's lawyers argued that the lack of consular access played a role in the death penalty being applied because the @entity16 national incriminated himself in statements made during ' non-custodial interviews ' with the police on the day of the murder			1
had @entity25 been given access to the @entity16 consulate it would have been likely to have arranged a lawyer who would have advised the accused man to limit his statements to the police			0
as it was , the @entity16 authorities were never informed of his arrest			0
however @entity14 officials argue that @entity0 made statements to authorities before he was in custody and thus outside the purview of the @entity5			2
@entity186 spokeswoman @entity185 said the federal government had filed a brief with the @entity8 @entity64 on july 1 supporting @entity0 's bid for a stay of execution until the end of this year			1
the @entity7 high commissioner for human rights , @entity22 , appealed to @entity92 to commute @entity25 's sentence to life imprisonment she said : ' this is to allow some consideration of the fact that mr. @entity25 was not afforded a visit by @entity16 consular officials at an appropriate moment in the trial proceeding - so to allow that to be taken into account			2
' the @entity54 administration warned that allowing the execution to go forward could have serious repercussions on @entity8 foreign relations and implications for @entity8 arrested abroad			1
in a letter dated june 28 , @entity8 secretary of state @entity210 and attorney general @entity211 wrote : ' the @entity8 is best positioned to demand that foreign governments respect consular rights with respect to @entity8 citizens abroad when we comply with these same obligations for foreign nationals in the @entity8			2
' a 2004 ruling by the @entity31 held that the @entity8 must review @entity0 's conviction and sentence to remedy earlier instances in which the @entity5 had not been honored in @entity8 criminal cases			1
the top @entity7 human rights official last week urged @entity14 call off @entity0 's execution , as have dozens of former @entity8 law enforcement officials and ex-diplomats who argue that it would put @entity8 at risk in prosecutions abroad			1
@entity231 , a @entity232 professor , has been hired by the @entity16 government to represent @entity25			0
she points to the fact that , three years ago , the @entity8 @entity64 rejected a similar appeal by a @entity16 national convicted in @entity14 who objected to the lack of consular consultation			2
she said : ' we have presented substantial evidence that in this case , the @entity5 really mattered			0
' the fact is that , if mr. @entity25 had received the consular assistance that he was entitled to , he never would have been convicted , let alone sentenced to death			0
' the @entity246 , the state 's highest criminal court , rejected @entity25 's request for a stay of execution			0
they claimed that @entity25 ' does n't have a due process right to remain alive until the proposed legislation becomes law			0
' @entity14 executes more criminals than any other state and that has long caused friction with @entity50 , which has no death penalty			0
although the @entity8 government has signed the @entity5 , @entity259 has not passed a law to implement it .			1
