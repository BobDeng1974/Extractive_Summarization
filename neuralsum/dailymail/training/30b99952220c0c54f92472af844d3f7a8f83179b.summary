by @entity0 it was the final day of the @entity2 at @entity3 today and many racegoers took it as their opportunity to wear their brightest , boldest and best outfits for the full day of gripping racing action			1
from fluorescent dresses and large fascinators for the women , to floral head - to - toe multi-coloured suits for the men - there were styles of all kinds on offer at the @entity20 racecourse			1
despite yesterday being @entity21 - with scores of women attending the day in their finest attire – dozens of females still used today ’s final day of racing as an excuse to don their posh frocks and high heels			1
one woman , left , was spotted arriving at the course in a sleek cream dress , black fascinator and towering high heels while two other ladies , right , posed for a selfie of themselves in their brightly - coloured dresses the full day of racing appeared to be a bit much for some spectators and one woman was spotted sitting on the ground - despite there being plenty of empty chairs nearby despite wearing an expensive - looking sleek black dress , this woman did n't seem to mind getting it dirty as she lay on the ground at the course as the day 's racing came to an end some women opted for stylish ensembles , including two stunning ladies , left , who went for a chic monochrome look , while others opted for a brighter and bolder get - up , including one woman , right , who teamed a dusty pink mini dress with a hot pink blazer and chunky metallic wedge heels the wet weather did n't dampen the spirit of racegoers and many women ensured they kept dry their hair and outfit dry with a trusty umbrella one bride - to - be celebrated her hen do at the @entity2 today , left , and appeared to be enjoying herself with a face mask while others were forced to shield under an umbrella , right , after rain hit the course this afternoon as always , the women cranked up the glamour for the biggest day in the racing calendar , with many having applied fake tan , voluminous hair extensions and heavy make - up prior to putting on their brightly - coloured embellished dresses			1
many looked stunning in their stylish ensembles , including two women who opted for sleek and chic monochrome dresses , and the majority of ladies opted for an outfit which gave a nod to the summer 's floral and pastel trends			1
however , despite many making their best effort to look good , bouts of rain at the racecourse caused havoc with some of the well - turned out women who desperately tried to shield themselves from the wet weather with coats and ponchos			0
it was n’t just the women who made all the effort today though – several men also tried to pick up style points with their choice of outfit			0
four men could be seen wearing head - to - toe suits which were each printed differently with brightly - coloured graphics			2
one had a get - up which was covered in images of numerous packs of cards while another opted for a mismatched floral ensemble			0
despite the wet weather , it did n’t dampen spirits at the course and thousands still enjoyed drinks aplenty as they watched the biggest race of the year – the @entity131 ’s @entity130			2

one had a get - up which was covered in images of numerous packs of cards while another opted for a mismatched floral ensemble some women opted for floor - length embellished gowns as they made their way into @entity38 for the day 's racing , left , while one man appeared to be enjoying himself as he left the course - teaming his bright , blue smart suit with a pair of pink high heels it all proved a bit too much for one reveller who was spotted apparently passed out on the ground at the racecourse , surrounded by empty drinks cans despite many women making their best effort to look good , bouts of rain at the racecourse caused havoc with some of the well - turned out women who desperately tried to shield themselves from the wet weather with coats and ponchos women used umbrellas , ponchos and coats to try and stop themselves from getting wet as the heavens opened at the racecourse as the festival came to a close the long day did appear to take its toll on some spectators though – and many could be seen catching up on sleep at the course			1
one man , surrounded by discarded drinks cans , appeared to have passed out on the floor , while another woman looked worse for wear as she lay on the ground surrounded by empty chairs			0
there was n’t quite as much action among spectators at the course today compared to yesterday though – when a fight broke out between three men			0
the men , all dressed in suits , shirts and ties , started brawling near to the finishing post and nearby spectators had to dodge the pints of beer which were sent flying during the ruckus			2
the majority of ladies opted for a glamorous take on the summer 's floral and pastel trends while some others decided to play it safe with a darker colour			0
due to the wet weather , most women teamed their fancy frock with a blazer , coat and umbrella how patriotic ! three women try to shield themselves from the rain under a @entity217 flag umbrella , while two others opt for a see - through ' i hate rain ' umbrella smile ! two women , wearing brightly coloured pink dresses , say cheese for the camera as they huddle together under a brightly - coloured umbrella in an attempt to stay warm and dry despite the wet weather , it did n't dampen spirits at the course though and thousands still enjoyed drinks aplenty as they watched the biggest race of the year - the @entity131 's @entity130 some women appeared to be less - than - impressed with the wet and windy weather although others took it in their stride and did n't let it stop them enjoying the day out while @entity239 is famous for pearls and fur , and @entity242 for its hats , @entity3 has become synonymous with fashionable girls out to have fun in the highest heels they can find			1
eschewing cosy coats and tights in favour of goose - pimpled bare legs and delicate frocks , @entity3 girls are almost as famous for their ability to withstand the cold as they are for their colouful approach to style			2
as with the @entity259 , organisers refuse to impose a dress code on guests and , beyond exhortations to dress smartly and avoid anything that might offend , say anything goes			0
but perhaps a warning is n't required : @entity20 are famous for their glamorous approach to getting dressed and love nothing more than the chance to strut their stuff in the most eye - catching outfits they can find			2
and more is definitely more when it comes to make - up and grooming too , with glossy long locks , honey - toned skin and lashings of lipgloss among the most popular beauty choices			0
male racegoers are n't immune from the pull of equestrian glamour either , with the majority plumping for dapper suits or a blazer , although some decide to up the ante with a spot of fancy dress			0
despite the presence of the infamous @entity293 on the course , the colourfully dressed @entity3 crowd are enough to ensure that as many people watch the @entity2 for the fashion as they do for the race itself			0
it was n't just the women who opted for stylish ensembles - some men opted for smart get - ups too including this group who stood out from the crown in the bold trousers the crowd cheer on the runners in the first race during @entity311 of the @entity131 's @entity312 at @entity38 , @entity20 rain rain go away ! a group of women cover themselves in see - through ponchos and sit on makeshift blankets as they try to enjoy their drinks despite the wet and windy weather despite the wet weather at the racecourse , it did n't seem to dampen the spirit of the spectators too much and instead they did their best to keep warm and dry a trio of women carefully make their way across the racecourse in their sky - high heels and elegant dresses as the final day of racing at @entity3 comes to a close			1

scores of women put on their best dresses and towering high heels as they arrived for the biggest race of the year
from bright floral prints to sleek monochrome numbers - women cranked up the glamour for the final day at @entity3
it was n't just the women who *sported* their best outfits - four men tried to rival them with unique multi-coloured suits
however , the long day of racing proved too much for some - with a few spectators spotted *slumped* on the ground
