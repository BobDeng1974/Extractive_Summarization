by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 , the career armed robber who shot two policemen in a series of horrifying raids , who has now been given a third life sentence an armed robber has received an astonishing third life sentence after twice being freed to strike again			1
the lenience of the criminal justice system was highlighted yet again as a judge yesterday apologised to career criminal @entity3 ’s two latest victims for the fact that he had been at liberty to attack them			1
@entity3 , 58 , was then given his third ‘ life ’ sentence – but only with an order that he serves 12 @entity22 said that the case showed the phrase ‘ life sentence ’ was now just a ‘ meaningless lie to reassure the public ’			1
the thug , who once almost severed a policeman ’s arm with a point - blank pistol blast , was caught on this latest occasion after bursting into a bookmakers			2
he was traced after he twice fired his shotgun , then dropped it and removed his balaclava to pick it up – which meant he was seen by dozens of witnesses			0
but that was little comfort to the two female employees when he demanded money from the safe			0
for he was only free to threaten their lives because the parole board first released him after he was jailed for life in 1984 for shooting at policemen , then again after he was jailed for life for holding up a post office in 2000			2
giving @entity3 his third life sentence , judge @entity50 said yesterday at @entity52 in @entity53 that the staff at the bookmaker , @entity54 and @entity55 , deserved an apology			1
judge @entity50 said : ‘ mrs @entity54 and mrs @entity55 will be sitting in the public gallery wondering how it is that @entity3 could have entered the betting shop where they worked when he was the subject of not one , but two sentences of life imprisonment for attempting to murder police officers and members of the public while committing robberies			1
‘ the victims deserve an explanation about why a man who had previous life sentences for robbery was given his liberty			1
i wish to apologise to them on behalf of the criminal justice system for placing them in that position			2
’ shotgun cartridges , recovered by police from one of @entity3 's many armed robberies judge @entity50 apologised to the two victims of the @entity86 robbery , @entity87 and @entity88 , who were working at the time of one of @entity3 's robberies judge @entity50 added : ‘ i ’m not convinced by the defendant ’s protestations of future good conduct			1
’ mrs @entity55 told the court that she had been deeply traumatised by the attack , saying : ‘ every time i closed my eyes i could see this man and the gun			0
’ a villain since his youth , @entity3 was given his first life sentence at the @entity104 in 1984 , with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 18 years , for ‘ terrifyingly violent ’ attempted robbery			1
freed from that first ‘ life ’ sentence , he was swiftly given his second after holding up a post office in @entity112 in @entity113 in 2000 – apparently within weeks of leaving prison – with a sawn - off shotgun			0
he escaped with £ 16,000			0
this second time , he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of six and a half years , but ended up serving 12			0
however he had not long been released before he launched his latest attack on @entity86 in @entity120 , central @entity53 , at 8am one morning last november			0
last night @entity121 , director of the @entity122 , said : ‘ this is a rare and brave example of a judge pointing out that soft sentences put the public at huge risk			2
‘ the case shows how the phrase “ life sentence ” has become a lie that falsely reassures the public			0
in reality it often means the same inadequate prison term and release after a few years			0
