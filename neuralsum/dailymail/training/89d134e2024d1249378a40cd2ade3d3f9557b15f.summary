by @entity0 world number one @entity2 's preparations for the @entity4 suffered another blow after a straight - sets defeat to @entity7 in the third round of the @entity9			1
@entity2 , who looked to be back to his imperious best in winning @entity12 last month , has struggled with the transition onto the @entity15 hard courts and with the final major of the year a little over two weeks away , doubts will be raised as to whether the 27 - year - old can make a credible challenge			2
he was thumped by @entity19 at the @entity20 last week and any thoughts that may have been an aberration vanished following a 7 - 6 ( 8/6 ) 7 - 5 defeat to 16th - seeded @entity24 in one hour and 44 minutes			1
one of those days : @entity2 is out of the @entity25 after a straight - sets loss to @entity7 surprise : veteran @entity7 looks to the sky after clinching a 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) , 7 - 5 win ' just many , many , many things are not clicking these two weeks on hard courts , ' said @entity2 on the @entity33 website			1
' it 's unfortunate , but it 's more than obvious i 'm not playing even close to what i 'm supposed to play			0
i have to keep on working and trying to get better for the @entity4			0
' the ongoing tournament in @entity9 is the only @entity40 title that @entity2 has not won , although he has been a finalist on four occasions			0
the opportunity , therefore , to complete a career ' @entity44 ' has been put on hold for another year following thursday 's defeat			0
@entity2 was made to toil in a three - set victory over @entity48 24 hours earlier and looked uncomfortable throughout , making 30 unforced errors before limply conceding his serve in the final game to give 32 - year - old @entity7 victory			2
on the stretch : @entity2 form has taken a turn for the worst ahead of the @entity4 next month respect : @entity2 congratulates @entity7 following the third - round game			1

@entity7 beats @entity2 in straight sets , 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) , 7 - 5
follows defeat to @entity19 last week
*djokovic* in poor form ahead of the @entity4 next month
