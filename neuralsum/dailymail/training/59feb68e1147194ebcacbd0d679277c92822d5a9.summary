the @entity0 is to spend £ 250million to clear a massive backlog of knee , cataract and hip replacement operations			1
@entity5 will today announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment – unless it is clinically necessary			2
but the plan will also mean longer waiting times for tens of thousands of patients			1
surgeons : the @entity0 is to spend £ 250million to clear a backlog of knee , cataract and hip replacement operations the number of people on the @entity0 waiting list now stands at 3.1million – its highest for six years ; with almost 600 having waited for longer than 12 months			1
the health secretary will say the money will pay for up to 100,000 operations over the next few months in a bid to treat some of those who have waited the longest			1
officials admit that meeting the backlog will cause a short - term rise in the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks – still the most important target for hospitals – breaching a national pledge that 90 per cent of patients should be treated within this timescale			1
ministers say this short - term breach is necessary to clear the huge backlog in elective surgery , which they attribute to higher demand and an ageing society			0
it means an extra 100,000 people a month are being referred for treatment compared to 2010 , with hospitals performing an extra 2,000 operations a day			1
but @entity46 will say that the new 12 - month treatment pledge is merely a way to deflect attention from a failure to tackle growing waiting lists in the health service over the past four years			1
action should be targeted at all those on the waiting list – not just the longest – they say			0
in may 2010 , the month of the last election , some 20,662 patients had waited for 18 weeks or more			2
by may 2014 , this total had soared to 29,847			0
the situation is so bad in some trusts that patients have been urged to pay privately if they want to be treated more quickly			2
the clinical commissioning group in @entity64 , for example , has imposed tough restrictions on cataract operations – and has been named and shamed by the @entity67			0
' we need targets that help patients ' : @entity5 will announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment at the same time , the local trust – @entity76 – allows people denied @entity0 treatment to pay for the service that would otherwise be provided free			1
its website offers ‘ a new option , between the traditional private sector and the @entity0 ’			2
mr @entity5 ’s response is to target those waiting more than a year			2
in may 2014 , 574 people were in this position – down from 18,458 four years previously			0
every person who has waited more than 52 weeks or is on the verge of doing so will have their case reviewed to see whether they should be fast - tracked			0
on a visit to @entity93 in @entity94 , the health secretary will say : ‘ no one – except in exceptional circumstances – should have to wait more than a year			0
‘ [ we need ] targets that help patients get treatment when they need it – not targets followed blindly with no regard for the impact on individuals			0
‘ an @entity0 confident that – in the end – it will continue to meet the huge challenges ahead if it leaves room , amongst many loud , competing pressures , for the quietest but most important voice of all : that of the patient			2
’ @entity113 , a @entity46 health spokeswoman , said : ‘ @entity114 promised to protect patient care , but instead he has lost control of waiting times			1
‘ the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks for their treatment has increased by 50 per cent since 2010 , and the cancer waiting time target has been missed for the first time ever			0
‘ the @entity124 have mismanaged the @entity0 – and it ’s patients who are paying the price			1
’ funded by the extra £ 250million , the @entity0 will in the next few weeks carry out more than 100,000 treatments to people who have been waiting more than 18 weeks , of which 40,000 will be admitted to hospital			1
it will also conduct an immediate review of every person waiting over or close to 52 weeks			0
treating them will be a priority , unless there are strong clinical reasons for the delay or the patient chooses to wait longer			0
a @entity139 source said : ‘ because operations on longer waiters are often more complex and difficult , they take more time and resources			0
‘ however , by the end of the year the @entity0 will start meeting the target again			1

almost 600 @entity0 patients have waited more than a year for their operations
the money will pay for as many as 100,000 operations in coming months
@entity46 calls it a ploy to distract attention from *lengthening* waiting lists
