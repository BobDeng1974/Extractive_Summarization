by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 refused to rule out military action yesterday as he rebuked @entity4 over its grab for the @entity6			0
the prime minister vowed the @entity8 would ‘ do everything ’ to protect the interests of the territory after @entity12 demanded he hand power to them			1
he said the sovereignty of the @entity6 would be up to those who lived there when they hold a referendum in march			0
he added it was ‘ really important ’ for countries around the world to ‘ sit up and notice ’ the result – certain to be overwhelmingly in favour of retaining ties with @entity8			1
war of words : president of @entity4 , @entity30 , pictured left , accuses @entity8 of stealing the @entity6 in an open letter addressed to prime minister @entity2 the remarks came after @entity4 ’s president @entity30 launched a fresh attack by insisting her nation was ‘ forcibly stripped ’ of the @entity6 in a ‘ blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism ’ – a claim branded ‘ crazy ’ by @entity41 officials			1
in an open letter to mr @entity2 , published as an advert in left - wing newspapers on the 180th anniversary of the alleged january 1833 takeover , she accused the @entity8 of defying @entity48 resolutions by refusing negotiations over the @entity6			1
but in a strong message which risked angering @entity12 , number 10 made clear @entity8 would respond with force if threats to the islands emerged			1
a source said : ‘ this is not a military situation but there is no doubt that we can defend the islands			0
the people of the @entity6 should be just left alone			0
’ @entity6 last night issued their own open letter addressed to the @entity4 president			1
in the 1830s @entity8 was arguably at the height of its colonial power			2
the jewel in the crown was @entity69 while @entity70 , @entity71 as well as key parts of @entity73 including @entity74 and the @entity75 were all under the @entity76			0
in @entity77 , @entity8 captured three colonies from the @entity79 in 1796 which were officially ceded in 1814 , and consolidated into a single colony , known as @entity81 in 1831			1
the period between 1815 and 1914 , is often referred to as @entity8 's ' imperial century ' with around 10,000,000 square miles of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the @entity86			1
after the defeat of @entity89 at the @entity90 in 1815 , @entity8 's only serious international rival was @entity91			2
overwhelming naval supremacy led to a state of affairs known as ' @entity94 ' , with @entity8 adopting the role of global policeman and enjoying a foreign policy dubbed ' splendid isolation '			2
because @entity8 exerted such influence in world trade , the economies of countries such as @entity101 and @entity4 were effectively controlled from @entity104			2
the term ' informal empire ' , is used by historians to describe this state of affairs			0
a group labelling themselves @entity110 said : ‘ we look forward to our referendum in march and failure on your part to accept the outcome will prove to the world that there is only one colonial power in the region			0
’ the letter added : ‘ we have never been prouder of our association with the @entity8 and our unique relationship			1
any decision to change that would be our and not your choice			0
’ @entity8 has four warships , four @entity128 fighter - bombers and a 1,000 - strong garrison on the @entity6 , which are still claimed by @entity4 despite their crushing defeat in the 1982 war which cost 255 @entity81 lives			1
mr @entity2 insisted the islanders should be granted the right to self - determination under the @entity48			0
he said : ‘ they ’re holding a referendum this year and i hope the president of @entity4 will listen to that referendum and recognise it is for the @entity6 to choose their future			0
’ @entity142 , a member of the @entity6 ’ @entity143 , said : ‘ the letter sent by president @entity30 is not only historically inaccurate but fails to mention the most significant aspect of our recent history – the attempt by @entity4 to take away our home by military force when they invaded			1
’ diplomatic friction between @entity8 and @entity4 has increased since 2010 , when the government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands			1
last year @entity12 accused the @entity8 of ‘ militarising ’ the @entity157 after prince @entity159 ’s posting as an @entity128 search - and - rescue helicopter pilot			2
diplomats believe president @entity30 is using sovereignty claims to deflect attention from unpopular social and economic policies			2
the @entity165 has also threatened to expel the country for cloaking in secrecy its inflation and growth data			0
@entity8 's @entity170 rejected @entity172 's call for negotiations , sticking to @entity104 's long - established stance that the approximately 3,000 people of the @entity6 had chosen to be @entity81			1
' there are three parties to this debate , not just two as @entity4 likes to pretend			0
the islanders ca n't just be written out of history , ' the @entity170 said			0
' as such , there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the @entity6 unless and until such time as the islanders so wish			0
' the @entity81 task force reached the @entity157 in may 1982 and retook @entity188 before preparing to retake the main @entity6			2
the @entity4 air force sank several @entity81 ships , and @entity192 missiles sank the destroyer @entity194 and the @entity195			2
a copy of @entity4 president @entity30 's letter to @entity2 the @entity6 : diplomatic friction between @entity8 and @entity4 has intensified since 2010 , when the government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands many other ships were damaged , some badly with considerable loss of life , but the sinking of @entity208 the @entity209 by a @entity210 was considered a turning point			1
the @entity81 fought their way across the island with an @entity4 surrender on june 14 , 1982			2
the @entity81 lost 250 men and took more than 10,000 prisoners of war , while the @entity4 lost 746 , of which 368 had been on the @entity209 when it sank			2
@entity172 said her open letter was timed to coincide with the 180th anniversary of the day when @entity4 was ' forcibly stripped ' of the islands in what she called a ' blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism '			1
noting that the islands were located 14,000 km ( 8,700 miles ) from @entity104 , @entity172 accused @entity8 of expelling @entity4 from the islands and carrying out a ' population implantation process '			1
@entity8 disputes that version of history			2
it says no civilian population was expelled from the @entity6 on or after jan. 3 , 1833			0
@entity172 's allegations were made in an open letter addressed to @entity2 and @entity48 secretary general ban ki - moon			1
they are the latest in a string of inflammatory rants over the islands ’ future and come less than ten weeks before around 1,500 eligible islanders hold the first ever vote on whether they want to remain @entity81			1
the referendum set for march 10 - 11 , overseen by international observers , is widely expected to send a clear message to @entity4 to keep its hands off			0
that would be a humiliation for president @entity30 who has used sovereignty claims to deflect attention from unpopular social and economic policies			2
the sinking of the @entity209 : crewmen of the @entity209 escape in life rafts when it was sunk on may 2nd 1982 a key moment in the @entity157 president @entity172 shows a plaque with the name ' @entity6 ' ( left ) and a man sets fire to an effigy of prince @entity159 during a commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the @entity157 in april last year it would also underpin the @entity48 principle of ‘ self - determination ’ for the people of the @entity6			0
in the letter , president @entity30 said @entity4 was ‘ forcibly stripped ’ of the islands it calls @entity6 in a ‘ blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism ’			1
she added that ‘ @entity4 on the islands were expelled and the @entity8 began a population implementation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule ’			1
recipient : the president 's letter was also addressed to @entity48 secretary general ban ki - moon she added : ‘ since then , @entity8 , the colonial power , has refused to return the territories to the @entity4			1
’ the @entity170 ‘ strenuously denied ’ the claims and accused @entity4 of trying to ‘ write the @entity6 out of history ’			0
@entity41 sources said the government could order sir @entity288 , @entity8 ’s ambassador to the @entity48 , to rebut the ‘ crazy ’ allegations			0
in a speech to the @entity48 last year , sir @entity288 criticised @entity4 ’s ‘ aggressive territorial aspirations ’ over the @entity6 and said its claims were ‘ without foundation ’			0
he said : ‘ no civilian population was expelled on 3 january 1833 and the @entity8 has never implanted any civilian population			0
’ diplomatic friction between @entity8 and @entity4 has intensified since 2010 , when the government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands			1
the letter was published in the @entity303 and the independent newspapers			1
it appears to have provoked an angry reaction from some islanders			0
several messages have appeared on @entity309 purporting to be from islanders condemning the papers ' decision to publish them			0
one message to the @entity303 read : ' any particular reason why you continue to publish literature from someone that refuses to accept our existence ? '			0

open letter appears in the @entity303 and @entity324 newspapers
@entity30 says @entity8 ' stole ' the islands
*outburst* marks the anniversary of the islands becoming @entity81 territory
