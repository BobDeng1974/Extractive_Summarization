a @entity2 @entity1 leader has called for action to tackle a jihadi sub-culture after an islamic state video showed a suspected @entity6 beheading @entity8 journalist @entity7 , held hostage in @entity10			1
@entity11 , an adviser to the @entity12 , said @entity2 from across the country 's communities had to stop young men being seduced by radical ideologies			1
' this sub culture of this " jihadi - cool " - as they call it in the media - within the margins of society ... that is the real challenge , ' he told @entity25			0
' this is a problem that affects all of us and it will only be dealt with more effectively if all of us are working together on this			0
he also told @entity44 's @entity43 newspaper that anyone who recognised the man in the video had a duty to contact police			1
in @entity51 , @entity8 defense secretary @entity50 said the threat from @entity53 was ' beyond anything we 've seen ' and the @entity56 opened a criminal investigation into the death of @entity7 on the video , which featured a masked man speaking @entity60 with a @entity2 accent			1
as @entity63 officials tried to identify the man , the @entity12 denounced @entity7 's ' abhorrent murder ' and one of its advisers urged anyone who knows the killer 's identity to contact the police			1
horror at the video spanned from the @entity63 to @entity74 , where @entity75 asked why the @entity8 and its allies had not cracked down on @entity53 fighters long before they captured large areas of @entity10 and @entity75			1
@entity7 , 40 , was beheaded by an @entity53 militant in the video that surfaced on the internet on tuesday , and officials in @entity51 revealed that @entity8 special forces had tried unsuccessfully to rescue him along with other @entity8 hostages earlier this summer			1
@entity11 said anyone who recognised the man in the video had a duty to contact police a firefight between the @entity8 forces and islamic state militants during the rescue attempt appeared to be the first direct ground engagement between the two sides			1
the video caused particular shock in @entity2 , which is home to about 2.7 million @entity1 , although the hundreds of @entity2 men fighting alongside the militants in @entity75 and @entity10 have created concern for some time			1
the @entity99 newspaper said a former hostage had identified the masked man as the leader of three @entity2 who guarded foreign hostages in the city of @entity106 's stronghold in eastern @entity10			1
the @entity25 also reported that hostages had nicknamed their three captors @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , after members of the @entity114 pop group			0
@entity115 , managing director of the counter-extremism @entity116 , said it was almost inevitable that men who had fought in @entity10 would return to plan attacks in @entity121			1
' it is disturbing that people born and raised in @entity2 and who have gone to the same schools as us could have been essentially indoctrinated to the extent where they can justify raping women and chopping heads off , ' he said			2
four @entity2 @entity37 - two of whom had been to @entity131 training camps in @entity133 - killed 52 people in suicide bomb attacks on @entity44 in july 2005 , and @entity2 have previously appeared in graphic @entity136 videos			2
until recently , @entity53 concentrated on establishing its self - proclaimed caliphate in areas of @entity10 and @entity75 it had seized rather than on attacking the @entity63 , like @entity131 - the group from which it split			2
but @entity8 president @entity141 's decision to order air strikes on its fighters in @entity75 appears to have changed this			2
the beheading video also showed images of another @entity8 journalist , @entity148 , whose fate the group said depends on how the @entity8 acts in @entity75			1
' the life of this @entity8 citizen , @entity141 , depends on your next decision , ' the masked man says			2
in a @entity51 briefing on thursday , @entity154 said @entity53 was as sophisticated as any group the @entity8 had seen and posed an imminent threat ' to every interest we have , whether it 's in @entity75 or anywhere else			2
' ' they are beyond just a terrorist group			0
they marry ideology , a sophistication of ... military prowess , ' @entity154 said			0
' they are tremendously well - funded			0
this is beyond anything we 've seen			0
' general @entity171 , chairman of the @entity172 , suggested @entity53 would be a danger until it could no longer count on safe havens in @entity10			0
' this is an organization that has an apocalyptic , end - of - days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated , ' @entity171 said			0
' to your question , can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in @entity10 ? the answer is no. that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a non-existent border			0
' in @entity74 , @entity75 expressed their horror at the video of @entity7 's killing and questioned @entity63 strategy on @entity53 , which advanced out of @entity10 in june to capture several major @entity75 cities , including @entity195 , before the @entity8 intervened militarily			1
' the killing is the crime of all crimes , whoever the victim is , ' said @entity200 , 55 , an arabic language teacher at a secondary school			0
' i wish the world superpowers had fought these criminal groups in their incubators			0
the @entity8 should have hit @entity53 when they first appeared in @entity10			1
why did n't they hit them when they first entered @entity195 and other cities ? ' @entity213 , a 35 - year - old doctor , called for deeper @entity63 involvement , almost three years after @entity8 troops pulled out of @entity75			0
' air strikes are not enough , those criminals need ground troops to kill them and kick them out			0
' @entity2 prime minister @entity218 has ruled out sending troops to step up @entity2 's military involvement in @entity75 , which has so far been focused on delivering supplies to @entity223 forces fighting @entity53 and using jets to conduct surveillance .			2

@entity11 said @entity227 have to stop young men being radicalised
it follows beheading @entity8 journalist @entity7 , held hostage in @entity10
@entity7 's killer , *filmed* carried out the act , is suspected to be @entity2
@entity11 also said anyone who recognised him had a duty to call police
