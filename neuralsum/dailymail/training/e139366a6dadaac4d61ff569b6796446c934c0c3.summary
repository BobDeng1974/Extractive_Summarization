the back page of the @entity1 always plays to a theme when a big @entity3 night comes around and today is no different			1
in bold , capital letters , above a picture of @entity7 and @entity8 sitting side - by - side , runs a headline that sums up the mood of one - half of this city ’s fans , as they prepare for the glitz and glamour of @entity17			1
‘ bring on the @entity3 , ’ it declares			2
so big is the game that the @entity1 players arrived at @entity21 hours before the game			1
@entity23 and captain @entity7 were pictured arriving at the ground in their club tracksuits where they are expected to leave their cars and head to a nearby hotel for their pre-match meal and team meeting			0
@entity23 and captain @entity7 arrive at @entity21 ahead of their @entity3 group game with @entity17 @entity35 arrives at @entity21 in his club tracksuit along with @entity37 as the pair get ready to face @entity17 though @entity1 ’s form this season has , at best , been erratic , all of what has gone before will be forgotten this evening in the build - up to kick - off			1
these , after all , are the occasions the club have built their reputation on , going head - to - head against the continent ’s finest			0
it was a game of this magnitude , one that captures the focus of the football world , that @entity1 hoped they would get when their return to the @entity3 was confirmed on april 20 , with a 3 - 2 victory over @entity56 at @entity57			1
given that triumph was in the midst of a charge for the @entity62 , the significance of what @entity1 achieved on @entity65 was perhaps not appreciated at the time but , during the summer , as supporters began to look forward , realisation began to dawn			2
for five years between 2004 - 2009 , when @entity69 was in charge , @entity21 staged some of the most dramatic nights in its long and fabled history , with each campaign seeming to throw up games that would be talked about for years to come			2
those nights added to the stadium ’s aura			0
@entity7 scored a famous late goal at @entity21 in the 2004 - 05 season in the year that the @entity82 eventually won the competition @entity84 celebrates with goalkeeper @entity85 as @entity1 beat @entity86 at @entity21 in 2005 they are easily recalled : @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity86 in 2004 - 05 , the campaign which ended with @entity1 defying the odds against @entity89 in @entity90 ; @entity93 and @entity86 ( again ) in may 2007 ; @entity94 and @entity95 in 2008 , @entity17 in 2009			1
the deeper @entity1 got into the competition , the greater the intensity of their play became which added to the electricity in the stands , the atmosphere crackling beneath the floodlights			2
tickets for the @entity104 became the hottest in town , as fans wanted to experience @entity21 on a @entity107 night			1
‘ it is tough to explain what it is like here , ’ says @entity108 , the @entity17 defender who was once of @entity1			1
‘ these big @entity3 nights are special occasions and it is a special sound			1
it is a once in a lifetime experience , a special environment you must experience once in your career			0
@entity108 celebrates with @entity121 as @entity1 beat @entity122 at @entity21 in 2007 @entity123 battles for the ball with @entity125 as @entity1 played @entity126 in the 1978 @entity3 ‘ you put that to one side because it is an important game			1
it is not case of warning my team mates but i have told them of the tremendous atmosphere			0
the supporters here will drive them forward			0
it is a special game for @entity1 as they have been five years out of the @entity3			1

the @entity21 atmosphere will be working against us			2
i know what they are capable of on a @entity107 night			2
i am expecting a battle			0
we need to be ready for a tough , tough game			0
’ @entity108 knows that @entity17 will not just be playing the 11 men @entity8 selects but also the 40,000 - plus who are crammed into @entity21 ; it is a stadium that can leave a mark on visitors , so much so that a quote from the fabled @entity149 has been printed on a wall by the main entrance			1
it is also on a wall in the press conference room at their @entity156 training base			0
the famous @entity104 will have the flags and scarfs out as the fans get behind @entity8 ' side against @entity17 @entity163 @entity1 host real in @entity107 epic ‘ there ’s not one club with an anthem like @entity165 , ’ said @entity149			1
‘ there ’s not one club in the world so united with the fans			0
i sat there watching the @entity1 fans and they sent shivers down my spine			2
a mass of 40,000 people became one force behind their team			0
‘ that ’s something not many teams have			0
for that i admire @entity1 more than anything			2
’ it will be that way again tonight			0
before @entity1 ’s first game back in the @entity3 last month @entity8 had two supporters , who travel around the world to watch @entity1 and run the local radio station @entity188 , into his office at @entity156			1
during the course of their conversation , @entity8 was told that if he ' thought the atmosphere was good against @entity193 ( last april ) , wait until you see what it is like against @entity17			1
’ the wait it almost over			0
@entity1 have fought hard to bring occasions like this back			2
the challenge is now to show that they can compete on this stage and ensure this is not simply a one - off			0
@entity21 needs to crackle again			2
@entity94 3 - 1 ( @entity3 semi-final , may 1965 ) - this was the standard - bearer , a night that showed what @entity1 could become			1
@entity1 had won the @entity208 a few days earlier and 28,000 were on the @entity104 90 minutes before kick - off			0
the manner of the return defeat in @entity212 still rankles			0
@entity213 3 - 1 ( @entity3 quarter - final , march 1977 ) - the night when @entity1 ’s quest to become champions of @entity217 suddenly became reality			1
@entity220 , @entity221 and ‘ @entity222 ’ @entity219 scored the goals as @entity225 ’s side were hauled over the line			0
@entity227 3 - 0 ( @entity229 third round , november 1991 ) – you may wonder what this game is doing in the list but it was an extraordinary night , as @entity1 overhauled a two - goal first leg deficit thanks a @entity236 penalty , @entity238 ’s header and @entity239 ’ sliding late effort			1
@entity91 ( @entity3 group stage , december 2004 ) – ‘ i do n’t want to wake up in the @entity229 tomorrow morning , ’ @entity7 said on the day of the game			1
he did n’t thanks to an extraordinary comeback that featured goals from @entity245 , @entity246 and a wonder strike from the captain			0
@entity86 1 - 0 ( @entity3 semi-final , may 2005 ) – the next time @entity21 will have an atmosphere of this intensity is when they are on the brink of winning the @entity62			1
the stadium shook , @entity86 froze and @entity257 ’s controversial goal sent @entity1 to @entity90 .			0
