ms @entity0 complained that the handle of her @entity3 pistol was too big for her hands two ‘ petite ’ firearms officers are set to receive a pay - out of £ 70,000 after winning a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns			1
@entity0 and @entity11 said their weapons were too big for their small hands and as a result they could not reach the trigger , a tribunal has heard			1
the two women struggled with the grip of the pistols they were using – a @entity3 – and they also claimed their heads and legs were too small for their protective gear			2
the case , held at the @entity24 last week , found the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) guilty of discrimination against both officers in the provision of suitable firearms and safety equipment			1
it is understood the officers are set to receive £ 35,000 each after winning the case against the force – but there is expected to be an appeal			1
the decision comes after a number of extraordinary cases where police forces across the country have had to pay out thousands in compensation to officers due to injuries at work - including £ 8,000 to a policeman bitten by fleas			1
the two officers were based at different stations in the north west , with miss @entity0 part of the armed unit which protects the @entity54 atomic complex in @entity55 and @entity56 based at @entity57 , near @entity58			1
both females , who were described as being ‘ petite in stature ’ and with ‘ small hands ’ , asked on several occasions for a smaller and suitable grip on the weapon when they could not reach the trigger , but this did not happen , the tribunal heard			0
they also said their trainers failed to adjust their pistols while carrying out a test shoot			1
they both complained separately about their problems , after it is understood they did not receive as high a test marks as their male colleagues which put them at a disadvantage			1
their solicitor , @entity81 , of @entity82 , said that every officer joining at the rank of constable or sergeant is required to train to recognised standards as an authorised firearms officer and maintain the standard			1
a cycle of annual training shoots tests their ability which they must undertake as part of their job			1
mr @entity97 said : ‘ continued failure at these shoot days results in an unsatisfactory assessment , which could lead to the officer being dismissed			1
’ miss @entity0 , 39 , and @entity56 , 32 , also said there were other problems during the tests , including protection equipment which did not fit			1
they argued the helmets and kneepads were too large for their legs and heads which hindered their performance			2
they also argued they were too short for a wooden barricade , which was used as a resting place for the firearm			0
protection : miss @entity0 worked with an armed unit which protects the @entity54 nuclear plant in @entity55 the barricade was built for an officer of average male height and only offered support for those much taller			1
it is not known how tall the women were			0
the tribunal found there was no justification for this			0
it was said the women raised their concerns on ‘ a regular basis ’ but they were often dismissed , with no ‘ adequate consideration ’			0
the @entity26 said it was planning to appeal the tribunal decision			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the judgement has been passed and the @entity26 has lost on the grounds of indirect sex discrimination , however any claims of victimisation were unanimously dismissed			0
‘ as a result of what was discussed in this case , the @entity26 can also state it will be conducting an equality impact assessment			0
‘ this is to ensure that the @entity26 remains committed to providing the right training and equipment , together with a commitment to equal opportunities			2
’ miss @entity0 and @entity56 were members of the @entity151 , which supported the claim			1
a spokesman for the federation said the officers were expecting to receive a pay - out of £ 35,000 each subject to an appeal and remained in their current roles			2
they said the pay - out was on the basis of sex discrimination – which included their reputational damage as they received lower marks on their tests as a result			0
work : meanwhile , @entity56 , 32 , worked at the @entity57 nuclear site near @entity58 in @entity170 ( file picture ) the spokesman added : ‘ it was all part and parcel of it – the damage to their reputations because if they were scoring less on these proficiency tests while other colleagues were more suited to the equipment , they were in a lesser position			1
’ the spokesman said they may not receive the pay - out for months due to the appeal			0
no further details of the officers could be released due to the fact the case was still on - going			2
after the judgement , chief executive of the federation , @entity193 , said he was pleased with the outcome , adding he hoped the constabulary would remove the ‘ disadvantage ’ and ensure all officers had a fair opportunity			2
in december last year it emerged a police community support officer who injured her knee while investigating a burglary was awarded £ 4,000 in compensation			0
@entity205 , 53 , was responding to a 999 call reporting a break - in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft - high wooden fence			0
in april last year a policeman was paid £ 8,000 compensation after being bitten by fleas while at work			0
the extraordinary injury claim was made after colleagues complained that their police station in @entity218 had become infested with the insects			2
it was one of a number of workplace injury claims paid by @entity223 which had spent £ 900,000 settling cases made by more than 50 policemen in three years			0
and @entity227 @entity226 triggered public outrage and criticism from her own chief constable last year for suing a burglary victim for £ 50,000 after tripping over a kerb			0
other claims include a police officer awarded £ 16,610 in compensation after he fell over a pile of blankets while chasing a suspect .			0

@entity0 and @entity240 are part of armed units at nuclear sites
as part of their jobs , they are required to take test shoots
failing a test shoot could mean that officers lose their jobs
@entity254 complained that their performance was hampered by equipment
they said the handles of their guns were too big
both officers say they complained to *senior* staff but were ignored
