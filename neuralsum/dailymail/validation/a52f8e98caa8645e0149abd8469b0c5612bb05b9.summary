a woman has finally achieved her dream of having children , thanks to eggs donated by her sister			2
@entity6 , 41 , spent six years and £ 7,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner @entity7 , 37 , both suffer from unexplained fertility problems			1
after a fourth round of @entity15 failed , the couple , from @entity12 , @entity13 , were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor			1
seeing how desperate they were to become parents , miss @entity6 's younger sister , @entity23 , 35 , offered to donate her own eggs			1
and finally , in december 2013 , miss @entity6 became pregnant			2
she gave birth to healthy twin baby boys @entity27 and @entity28 , now 8 months , in july last year			1
@entity6 , 41 , gave birth to healthy twin boys @entity27 and @entity28 , now 8 month , in july 2014 miss @entity6 said : ' i was so happy to discover that i was finally pregnant			1
' @entity23 has given me the best gift i could ask for , i 'll be forever grateful			2
' the couple 's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby			0
miss @entity6 , who has been in a relationship with @entity7 for 15 years , said : ' we started trying for baby when i was 34 , but after two years we realised something was wrong			1
' doctors could n't explain my fertility problems - i just could n't get pregnant			0
my sister had also struggled to conceive so i knew my age was n't to blame			0
' growing up , i always dreamed of having at least two children , and there was nothing i wanted more than to be a mum			0
' my friends have kids , most from when they were younger , so i only had to attend one baby shower			0
but when i saw people with children , i wished it would be me			0
' aged 36 , she turned to @entity15 treatment in an attempt to conceive			2
but three agonising years and three failed @entity15 attempts later , the pair were still childless			2
meanwhile her sister mrs @entity23 , who lives in @entity58 with her husband , gave birth to two children of her own , conceived through @entity15 treatment			1
miss @entity6 said : ' i was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant			2
even though she lives abroad , we 're really close and i loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew			0
' but i still longed for a child so @entity7 and i pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of @entity15			1
' @entity69 would have been our final chance for children because we could n't afford to pay for more treatments			0
' miss @entity6 ( right ) had been trying to conceive for six years , and had spent £ 7,000 on @entity15 treatment			1
she was only able to have children when her sister , @entity23 , 35 , ( left ) , donated her eggs miss @entity6 became pregnant in december 2013 , and gave birth to twins @entity27 in july 2014			1
she said her sister had given her ' the best gift she could have ever asked for ' but the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs			0
miss @entity6 said : ' at first we were devastated - they did n't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew , who would be willing to donate their eggs			1
' we went to my parent 's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said			0
' she promptly replied " you can use mine "			0
' i was in disbelief and giddy with excitement			0
' after mrs @entity23 's generous offer , they began the long process of tests and counselling			2
her eggs were harvested and fertilised with @entity7 's sperm			2
a year later , miss @entity6 was implanted with mrs @entity23 's eggs , but sadly , it was unsuccessful			1
miss @entity6 said : ' i was so disappointed when i discovered that @entity23 's eggs had n't worked			1
' but despite the emotional toll , i knew i had to just carry on			0
' so later that year in december 2013 , they tried for the final time , using miss @entity117 's embryos they 'd frozen from the fourth try			2
miss @entity6 , pictured with partner @entity7 , 37 , and her newborn babies , gave birth by caesarean section as doctors feared she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia miss @entity6 and her partner said they were ' overjoyed ' when they discovered they were having twins , who , eight months later , are thriving she will now celebrate @entity130 with her sons			1
she said : ' i 'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever : motherhood ' miss @entity6 became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins			1
she said : ' i 'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests , which were all negative , while trying to conceive from @entity15 , so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal			0
' during a hospital scan , we discovered we were having twins , i was even more overjoyed			0
' at 35 weeks , doctors worried that @entity6 was suffering from pre-eclampsia - a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure , which affects some women in the second half of their pregnancy			0
in order to minimize the risk , doctors delivered the twin babies via caesarean section			0
miss @entity6 said : ' i was disappointed that i would n't have a natural birth , but all i cared about was the boys being healthy			1
' @entity23 wanted to be my side when i gave birth , but only one person is allowed in the operating theatre so @entity7 clutched my hand instead			1
' without her , we would n't have a beautiful family			0
' now eight months old , @entity28 and @entity27 are thriving			2
miss @entity6 said : ' i still ca n't believe i 'm a mum and i ca n't wait to celebrate @entity130 with the boys			1
' i 'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever : motherhood			0
