most obese people are in denial over their weight , not accepting they are clinically ' obese ' , a new study by @entity1 has found most obese people are in denial about their weight , refusing to believe they are ' obese ' or even ' very overweight ' , new research has found			1
in one of the first studies of its kind to examine perceptions of obesity , fewer than 10 per cent of those who are clinically obese accept they have a serious weight problem			1
a survey carried out in 2012 examined 2,000 adults and found only 11 per cent of obese women accurately acknowledged they were ' obese '			1
most of the women questioned believed they were either ' very overweight ' or ' just right ' , @entity1 said			1
among men taking part , only seven per cent correctly judged their own weight , accepting they were ' obese '			1
sixteen per cent of obese male responders classified themselves as ' very overweight '			0
researchers discovered only 10 per cent of those taking part knew the @entity28 threshold for obesity			1
however those who knew a @entity28 of between 30 and 39.9 made a person obese were more likely to define themselves as such			1
experts fear as bigger sizes become the new ' normal ' , people are less likely to recognise the health problems linked to their weight			2
professor @entity37 , co-author of the study and director of the @entity41 centre at @entity42 , said : ' it 's a real worry that people do n't recognise that their weight places them in the obese category			1
' it means they are n't aware they are at increased risk of a number of health problems including cancer			0
' this is despite increased media coverage of obesity , and public health campaigns aimed at improving public awareness			0
' she added that the term ' obese ' is often considered derogatory , which may be why so many people reject it			2
' mass media often illustrate obesity in a way that people find offensive , with pictures of bulging beer bellies and huge behinds , so people shy away from these images			2
' but we also asked people whether they felt they were " very overweight " and the majority of those who were obese did not accept this term either			1
' this is a real problem , as it means they are unlikely to identify with health messages on the subject of weight			1
she added : ' we need to establish better ways for health professionals to address this sensitive subject and communicate with people whose health would benefit from positive lifestyle changes			0
' around 18,000 cases of cancer in the @entity90 each year are linked to being overweight or obese			0
excess weight is known to increase the risk of several types of cancer including cancers of the breast in post-menopausal women , bowel , womb , oesophagus , pancreas , kidney and gallbladder			0
excess weight is known to increase the risk of several types of cancer including cancers of the breast , pictured under the microscope , bowel , womb , oesophagus , pancreas , kidney and gallbladder dr @entity115 , @entity41 's head of health information , said : ' this study provides an interesting insight into how people who are overweight view themselves			0
' carrying those extra pounds can have serious health implications			0
' fat cells are active , releasing hormones and other chemicals that affect many parts of the body , and increase the risk of cancer			0
' maintaining a healthy body weight is one of the most important ways of reducing the risk of cancer , for both men and women			1
' it 's so important that health messaging and awareness campaigns are as effective as possible in supporting people of all shapes and sizes to make healthy choices			0
' in a separate study scientists in @entity143 discovered the majority of people , including doctors , are unable to visually identify whether a person is a healthy weight , overweight or obese			1
psychologists at the @entity150 asked participants to look at photographs of male models and categorise whether they are a healthy weight , overweight or obese according to @entity28 guidelines			1
they found the majority of people surveyed were unable to correctly identify the models ' weight			1
instead they underestimated weight , often believing overweight men to be healthy			0
in a related study , surveying healthcare professionals , researchers also found gps and trainee @entity166 were unable to visually identify if a person was overweight or obese			1
a separate study at the @entity150 found gps and trainee @entity166 were unable to visually identify if a person was overweight or obese the scientists also examined whether increased exposure to overweight and obese people affected a person 's ability to estimate the weight of a person			1
their findings suggested that exposure to heavier body weights may influence what people see as a normal and healthy weight and causes people to underestimate a person 's weight			0
psychologist , dr @entity187 , who conducted the research , said : ' we wanted to find out if people can identify a healthy , overweight or obese person just by looking at them			2
' primarily we found that people were often very inaccurate and this included trainee doctors and qualified doctors too			0
moreover , we found that participants systematically underestimated when a person was overweight or obese			0
' our study of @entity166 also found a tendency to underestimate weight which has important implications as it means that overweight and obese patients could end up not being offered weight management support or advice			2
' recent studies have found that parents underestimate their overweight or obese child 's weight and this could also act as a barrier to intervention			2
dr @entity187 added : ' over the last 30 years we have seen changes to population body weight , so examining how this has affected how we view our own and other people 's body sizes is an interesting area of research			2
' the @entity90 has the highest level of obesity in @entity222			0
obesity levels in the @entity90 have more than trebled in the last 30 years and , on current estimates , more than half the population could be obese by 2050			2
more than half of the adult population in the @entity228 are overweight or obese .			0
