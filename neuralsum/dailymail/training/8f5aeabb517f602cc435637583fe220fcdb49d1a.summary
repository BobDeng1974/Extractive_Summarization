by @entity0 @entity2 senior adviser @entity1 said today he believes there 's a ' possibility ' that @entity2 @entity5 will try to impeach the president			1
the @entity7 reports that @entity1 told attendees of a @entity10 breakfast that recent events , including the @entity2 's lawsuit against @entity13 , suggests the idea is not as far - fetched as it may seem			1
' i think a lot of people in this town laugh that off , ' @entity1 said			0
' i would not discount that possibility			0
citing former @entity36 governor @entity35 's calls for @entity37 to impeach the president and recent polls that show majority of @entity5 agree with her , @entity1 concluded that the @entity2 may yet draw up articles of impeachment against the president			1
' i think impeachment is a very serious thing that has been bandied about by the recent @entity5 vice presidential nominee and others in a very unserious way , ' @entity1 said			2
' and no one has even made any allegation of anything that would be within six universes from what is generally considered in that space			0
' that said , @entity1 predicted that the president 's plans to bypass @entity37 and unilaterally act on immigration could rankle @entity5 enough to jump start the process			2
' the president acting on immigration reform will certainly up the likelihood that they would contemplate impeachment , ' he said , according to @entity62 , adding it would be ' foolish ' not to consider it a prospect			0
house speaker @entity5 @entity30 , center , walks to a @entity2 @entity5 conference meeting on immigration issues , on @entity69 this morning			1
@entity30 's office accused @entity1 of not being serious about addressing the immigration crisis after it learned of his comments on impeachment a handful of @entity5 on @entity69 have talked about impeaching the president such as retiring rep. @entity75 , who sent his colleagues in @entity37 a book on ' the case for removing @entity13 from @entity79 ' last fall			1
but no one in party leadership has even winked in the direction of impeachment			0
@entity30 has vehemently denied that the @entity2 's lawsuit is a gateway to impeachment			1
and a spokeman for @entity30 characterized @entity1 's comments this morning as disingenuous			2
' we have a humanitarian crisis at our border , and the @entity2 is making matters worse with inattention and mixed signals , ' @entity30 aide @entity87 told the @entity7 , referring the more than 57,000 unaccompanied minors who have entered the country illegally since last october			0
' it is telling , and sad , that a senior @entity2 official is focused on political games , rather than helping these kids and securing the border , ' @entity87 added			1
this afternoon the president hopes to correct that during a meeting with @entity105 president @entity104 , @entity107 president @entity106 and @entity110 @entity109 president @entity108			0
