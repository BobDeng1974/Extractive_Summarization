using a minimum of eight body measurements , forensic teams were able to correctly identify people by their unique shape - even through clothes grainy cctv footage in which a criminal ’s face is obscured can make it difficult to identify perpetrators , and this job is even harder if no fingerprints are left at the scene			1
but , in what ’s been dubbed a biometric breakthrough , researchers have discovered that a person ’s body shape could equally give them away			0
using just eight measurements , forensic teams were able to correctly identify people - even through clothes			0
dubbed ‘ body recognition ’ , the technique was developed at the @entity25 , and is said to be comparable with facial and fingerprint analysis			1
a team of researchers , led by phd student @entity30 , studied the anatomical measurements of 4,000 @entity33 armed services personnel from a national database			1
in particular , they compared eight facial and eight body measurements to see if a person ’s body shape could be used for identification			1
measurements included overall height , length of the body from the hip bone to the feet , length of wrist to elbow , jaw line , pelvic width , chest width , the width of a person ’s face , from ear to ear , and the skull			2
the breadth of hips across the 4,000 people studied varied by up to 5.9 inches ( 150mm ) , making an individual measurement more unique			0
but , the length of ears across the sample varied by just 1.3 inches ( 35mm ) , making them harder to distinguish between			0
other measurements that can change , and were discounted in body recognition , include the width of the stomach , inner arm and calf			2
these areas are directly affected by weight gain and loss , for example			0
during tests , the results revealed that , compared with the face , fewer body measurements are needed to identify a person			1
‘ there 's been a lot of work conducted over the years on facial recognition , ’ said ms @entity30			1
measurements included height , length from hip to the feet , wrist to elbow , jaw line , pelvic width , chest width and the width of a person ’s face , from ear to ear			2
these measurements can be identified no matter what clothing the person may be wearing ( example pictured ) , because of the way gravity affects body shape the researchers studied the anatomical measurements of 4,000 @entity33 armed services personnel from a national database			1
in particular , they compared eight facial and eight body measurements to see if a person ’s body shape could be used for identification			1
measurements included overall height , length of the body from the top of the hip bones to the feet , length of wrist to elbow , jaw line , pelvic width , chest width , the width of a person ’s face , from ear to ear , and the skull			2

‘ this makes sense - humans have evolved to recognise faces , which is part of our survival mechanism , and the face contains some very distinctive features			0
‘ but what happens if the face is not shown , or if there is an unusual facial resemblance between two people ? ' what happens if identification of the face alone just is n't enough ? ’ she continued that the technique would prove particularly useful when trying to identify criminals , or missing persons , from @entity171 footage , for example			1
‘ measurements of the body , as well as the face , were used for forensic identification as early as the 19th century , ' continued ms @entity30			1
' it was believed that no two individuals had the exact same measurements			0
‘ however , this was overtaken by fingerprint analysis because it was considered more reliable in court proceedings , and the probability of finding matching individuals could be easily calculated			1
’ ms @entity30 ’ research discovered that , with a combination of eight body measurements , it is possible to reduce the probability of finding a duplicate to the order of one in a quintillion			1
this makes the results comparable with fingerprint analysis , she added			1
the larger the range of each of the measurements , the less chance there is of finding a duplicate , too , and the measurements can be identified no matter what clothing the person may be wearing			2
this could help identify criminals or missing persons on cctv when the face is obscured			1

' but what happens if the face is not shown ? what happens if identification of the face is n't enough ? ’ experts said that with eight measurements , the probability of finding a duplicate is one in a quintillion - comparable with fingerprint analysis this is because the way gravity affects the overall body shape remains unchanged , and any movements - such as those on security footage - will reveal the outline of a body			1
for example , once fully formed , an adult 's skeleton changes very little over the course of their life			0
the length of the femur , or the proportions from the wrist to the elbow , do n’t change until a person becomes elderly			0
the larger measurements provided by the body compared to the face mean that there is more variation between people			2
‘ despite what television and the movies would have people believe , there is often a lack of good quality video evidence , ’ said ms @entity30			2
‘ criminal cases usually involve a deliberate attempt to cover the face , or fine details ca n't be seen			0
‘ in our experience , the body is more variable than the face and should be used in identification more often			0
‘ another advantage to using the body is that larger dimensions are easier to locate on images and not affected by facial expressions			0

' body recognition ' technique was developed at the @entity25
experts studied anatomical measurements of 4,000 services personnel
they compared eight facial and eight body measurements for each
results found that , compared with the face , fewer body measurements are needed to identify a person
this could help identify criminals on cctv when the face is obscured
researcher @entity30 said : ‘ with eight measurements it is possible to reduce the probability of finding a duplicate to one in a quintillion ’
this makes the results comparable with fingerprint analysis , she continued
