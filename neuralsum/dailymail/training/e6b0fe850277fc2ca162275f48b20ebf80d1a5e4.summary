modernisation : crawling is an evolutionary phenomenon which might have evolved 200 - 300 years ago thanks to wooden floors in houses , say experts not worldwide : crawling is not what babies do everywhere across the world a @entity36 moment : anthropologist @entity7 's discovery happened by accident , during his time in @entity17 where he had been surveying the @entity19 people since 1988 he was told by one of his graduate students that the @entity19 babies never seemed to be crawling			1
‘ that ’s when the lightbulbs went off , ’ says @entity7 to @entity42			0
the babies are carried by their mothers or siblings 86 per cent of the time during the infants ' first 12 months , and when they are put down , the young children are usually placed in a sitting position , instead of prone on their stomachs			0
@entity19 babies go through an upright ‘ scooting ’ or shuffling phase , in which they push themselves along with their hands while sitting on their backsides			0
the reason for this is because of parasites on the ground , which are common in the area the @entity19 live			0
in @entity63 , and other similar societies , preventing predator attacks is similarly a reason why babies do not crawl and are carried throughout their first year and then walk straight away after that			0
safety first : our closest relative , the apes , rarely put their babies on the ground , but instead teach them to crawl on their mothers ¿ bellies according to @entity7 , crawling may have evolved around the same time as wooden floors in houses – only about 200 - 300 years ago			1
‘ for most of evolutionary history , kids were not put on the ground to shield them from pathogens or predation , so crawling is definitely the evolutionary novelty , ’ says @entity7			1

‘ it almost seems to be there is some kind of phylogenetic heritage to not crawling , ’ @entity7 says .			0

crawling might have evolved 200 - 300 years ago thanks to wooden floors in houses
anthropologist @entity7 says throughout most of evolutionary history , babies were not put on the ground in order to shield them from *danger*
some countries still do not allow their babies to crawl , such as @entity17 , *due* to parasites on the ground
