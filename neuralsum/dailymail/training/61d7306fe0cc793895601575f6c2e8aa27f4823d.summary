that is not a coincidence			0
he is so versatile and experienced and his calming influence is helping the rest of the team			0
he is a good , honest player and he does n’t try to overcomplicate things — all he has is a nasty habit of passing to his own team - mates ! but it ’s not just that he takes the easy option every time			0
he is always looking to pass it forward and get his attacking players on the ball in dangerous positions			0
