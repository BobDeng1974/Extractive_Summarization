the astronomical fee eclipses the $ 88million forked out by @entity157 billionaire @entity156 on a penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 @entity60			0
it proves that while the economic situation may be precarious some still have deep enough pockets to splash out super properties			0

in exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 10,923 - square - foot space opposite @entity194 with incredible views over the city			1

the @entity206 has reported that some potential buyers have claimed there are ' design flaws ' with the construction - namely that builders failed to provide a sufficient number of elevators			0
but new owner of the high - rise apartment who according to @entity50 chairman @entity48 is from a ' nice family ' clearly did n't share the same concerns			1
the building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings , which are expected to see their prices fall			1
