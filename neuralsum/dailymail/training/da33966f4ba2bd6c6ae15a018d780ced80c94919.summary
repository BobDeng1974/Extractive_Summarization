a man died in a motorway crash involving a wild boar that had strayed onto the carriageway in darkness , in an area where the increasing population of the animals is causing problems			1
the man , named by police as @entity11 , 47 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , died after his black @entity14 hit the animal on the @entity16 between junctions 16 and 17 near @entity18			1
populations of wild boar have risen recently , particularly in the @entity21 where the animals have caused havoc by digging up a cemetery and damaging a roadside verge			1
the accident , which took place just before 7pm on monday , happened less than two miles from a farm which has bred 200 wild boar			1
however police and owners of the @entity47 said the animal involved in the accident was not from the site			2
after the car hit the animal it was then struck by a white @entity55 articulated lorry			1
the motorway was closed for more than seven hours until 1am on tuesday			2
sergeant @entity57 said : ' this is a truly tragic incident and my thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim			0
' it is quite rare for a wild boar to be on the carriageway of the motorway			1
it is more common for the police to receive calls involving horses or deer but each is equally dangerous to motorists			2
' this was a particularly large wild animal and would have caused considerable damage to any vehicle			2
' i would appeal for anyone with any information about the incident to contact us as soon as possible			0
' the boar is also thought to have died in the crash			1
wild boar numbers have risen in nearby @entity21 and a wild one may have been involved in the crash a spokesman for @entity87 said that officers were baffled as to how the wild boar came to be wandering in the motorway - with the nearest colonies thought to be in the @entity21 in @entity92 and in @entity93			1
the last time a wild boar was seen in @entity13 was on the on the @entity95 in december 2009			1

they can run up to 30mph and weigh around 20 stone when fully grown			0
the animals can also jump 6ft			2
@entity105 , who owns the @entity47 that breeds the animal for salami , said : ' wild boar do travel and they are prepared to travel quite a distance			1
it 's only a matter of time before they start causing trouble			0
' it was n't one of ours involved			0
they are all behind a big fence			0
i have heard of boar coming up from the @entity21 though			1
they would have been here about three to four hundred years ago but they are not common any more			0
' you always here rumours of them being around though			0
it 's not very often they 're spotted here			0
it 's much more common in @entity131 and @entity132 where it 's much quieter			0
in the area we 've always tried to keep them away for this very reason			0
wild boar were hunted to extinction in @entity98 several centuries ago			1
but their population has started to rise again after several programmes to reintroduce them in the last fifteen years			0
there are now thriving herds spreading out into the countryside			0
boar are usually secretive and nocturnal and are likely to stay out of the way of humans			2
when fully grown a wild boar weighs around 20 stone and can jump 6ft			1
they can also travel large distances and reach speeds of 30mph			0
in medieval times , boar from the @entity157 were supplied for the @entity160 table - there is a record of an order for 100 boars and sows for a @entity167 feast in 1254			2
boar are known to inhabit parts of the @entity100 and the @entity21			2
the animals have roamed wild in the @entity21 in 2004 , after a 700 year absence			1
they started to populate the wild in 1999 after several escaped from a farm and in 2004 a group of 60 were dumped - further boosting wild populations			2
since then the population has grown steadily - with complaints about them digging up graveyards , gardens and grass verges			0
farming of wild boar in @entity98 became fashionable in the 1970s and boar originating from the @entity186 mainland were kept under the @entity187			1
residents in @entity189 in the @entity21 had their gardens damaged by the beasts last year ' this incident is one of those horrific things that happens when they are around			2
boar are very hard and very dense			0
' the driver of the car was killed instantly and the lorry driver did not suffer any serious injuries in the accident			0
a children 's playground was left destroyed in november after a herd of wild boar grazed on the land in the @entity21 for two months			1
homeowners in @entity189 also reported damage to their gardens			0
rangers say the @entity157 of @entity21 wild boar population is doubling every year thanks to the spread of commercial crops such as maize			1
in 2013 people living in and around the @entity21 said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby			1
wild boar dug up land where the ashes of loved ones were scattered at the @entity220 beauty spot on @entity221 outside @entity222			1
the animals also destroyed grass verges in the area and in 2013 the @entity226 announced a cull on the population			0
