@entity0 feels his startling turnaround over the course of the @entity4 @entity3 weekend has fuelled his belief anything is possible this season			1
@entity0 recovered from another miserable qualifying run last saturday , in which he made an error of judgement to hand @entity14 team - mate @entity13 pole position , to take the chequered flag by the end of sunday			1
starting from sixth on the grid represented the lowest position from which @entity0 has gone on to claim victory in @entity20 , with 27 successes now to his name , matching that of three - times champion sir @entity24			1
spurred on : @entity0 's victory in the @entity4 @entity3 has given him confidence in his title chances next step : @entity0 must now build on his @entity30 success in the @entity31 @entity3 in @entity32 crucially for @entity33 , @entity13 suffered his first retirement of the year and the gap between them heading into sunday 's home race for the @entity31 at @entity32 is now just four points			1
given the euphoria from the fans that followed @entity0 's success at @entity30 , that weekend may well prove to be a turning point			2
at the very least the 29 - year - old now knows what can be achieved from one day to the next , no matter the circumstances			2
' i look at it very positively , a massive turnaround that just shows you everything is possible , no matter how difficult or bad it is , ' said @entity0			2
' every day there is a new opportunity , and i now see an opportunity to turn things around while knowing there is still a long way to go			0
' it 's about making sure i have that mentality because there 's going to be days when it 's not going to be great , where there will be a friday , saturday or sunday that does n't work out			0
' but then you know there is an opportunity the next weekend			0
' storming form : @entity0 started in sixth place at @entity30 after a poor qualifying race but came first overall step up : @entity0 has admitted he must improve his form in qualifying races for @entity0 , an error - free qualifying on saturday is his first port of call to ensuring the confidence lift from @entity30 does not rapidly fade			1
mistakes have been made in the last three qualifying sessions that have proven costly for @entity0			1
' looking at the races i 'm confident i have the pace , ' he said			0
' obviously the car is fantastic and i do have the pace to deliver , it 's just because there is so much pressure there that sometimes you get it and sometimes you do n't			0
' i guess in the last three or four qualifying sessions i know i could have done better , but for the races i 've done pretty well			2
' they have always been strong , it 's just the qualifying , and it 's not been a huge , big , big problem			0
' i do n't need to change too much , just maybe small things			0
' closing in : @entity0 is now only four points behind @entity95 leader @entity13 @entity0 finished practice just 0.024 seconds clear of @entity13 in a now customary one - two for @entity14 , however , the opposition were closer			1
the removal from all cars of the front - and - rear - interconnected ( @entity101 ) suspension device that race director @entity103 threatened to ban after suggesting it was illegal , may have played a part			0
@entity107 's @entity106 finished a tenth of a second adrift of the @entity14 pair , whilst there were another six drivers within a second of the top two			2
@entity115 was seventh overall in his @entity117 , 0.880secs down , with @entity119 's @entity118 21st and 3.5secs back			0
troubled : @entity0 and @entity13 have n't always enjoyed an easy relationship despite being team - mates			1

@entity0 finished sixth in qualifying but won @entity4 @entity3
@entity0 is just four points behind @entity14 team - mate @entity13
@entity13 and @entity0 will go head - to - head at @entity31 @entity3
@entity0 admits he must improve his form in qualifying
