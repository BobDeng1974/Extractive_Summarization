by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 07:56 est , 20 june 2013 the reclusive widow of a wealthy property tycoon is battling her two stepsons in court over her share of her late husband 's £ 7million fortune			1
@entity8 warned his sons that he would be ' watching ' from beyond the grave to ensure they did not clash with their stepmother @entity11 after his death			1
but mrs @entity11 , 84 , who barely leaves her £ 4.25million @entity14 mansion , says her requests for more money from her husband 's estate have been met with ' stony silence '			2
@entity11 is locked in a court dispute with her two stepsons over her share of her late husband 's fortune she said her husband wanted her to live the rest of her days in comfort			1
however , she claims her income is not enough to cover the cost of maintaining eight - bedroom @entity29 , in @entity31 and its 30 acres			2
mrs @entity11 said she also needs more money to cover the £ 33,000 a year she pays her domestic help			2
she is now asking the courts to effectively re-write her husband 's will to ensure that ' reasonable provision ' is made for her in her autumn years			2
however , her stepsons , @entity39 and @entity40 , both high - powered solicitors , deny she has been hard done by and say her claim to need an income of over £ 220,000 - a - year is over the top			1
mrs @entity11 was told by a judge last year that she had left it too late to make her claim , but @entity46 has now opened a new chapter in the dispute by granting her permission to mount a full @entity51 challenge to that decision			0
@entity53 , for @entity54 , said her husband , a solicitor turned property mogul , meant for his second wife to have a ' substantial ' income after his death in june , 2005			0
in a letter written his son @entity39 before his death , mr @entity8 pleaded : ' make absolutely sure that the estate is not involved in the arguments and problems that can so often arise in probate			1
' the family 's dispute has reached the @entity69 despite @entity71 's pleas to his sons not to allow arguments between them and his warning that he will ' be watching ' from beyond the grave the couple both had children from previous relationships , lived together for 36 years and she helped to raise her step - children from a young age , the court heard			1
her husband 's will directed that she be allowed to stay in @entity29 rent free for life			0
he also left her his 50 per cent stake in their £ 1.2million home in @entity89 , which she has since sold , placing the proceeds in a @entity93 trust for tax reasons , the @entity86 added			0
her children also received property			0
the remainder of the estate - largely made up of at least £ 2.9million worth of shares in property company , @entity101 - was put into a trust , with mr @entity8 issuing instructions that it be used to ' maximise ' his widow 's income for life			1
mrs @entity11 , who suffers from arthritis and angina , says dividends from the company are not enough			0
' the result is that her capital has been steadily depleting , ' miss @entity112 told the court			1
the widow , who says she lives ' largely as a recluse ' , hopes to sell @entity29 - and replace it with a flat worth up to £ 3million in west @entity120 's upmarket @entity119 , the court heard			1
and it is hoped that any money left over after a replacement property is found could be used to supplement her income - but that is only if @entity29 sells for its massive valuation			0
mrs @entity11 rarely leaves her eight - bedroom mansion in the leafy @entity14 market town of @entity31 ( pictured ) the widow claims that , when she told her stepsons she needed more money , she was ' met with a stony silence '			2
they insist their stepmother 's income demands are excessive and that she would have had ample funds if profits from the sale of the @entity89 property were not tied up in a trust			0
judge @entity141 threw out mrs @entity11 's bid to up her income last year on the basis that her case had been brought to court almost six years outside the normal six - month time limit , running from the date on which the will was admitted to probate			1
her stepsons - one a director of @entity101 and the other a ' de facto director ' - had decided to plough much of the firm 's income into refurbishing its property portfolio			0
and the judge observed : ' such a long - term investment strategy is likely to be of considerable benefit to @entity39 and @entity40 on mrs @entity11 's death			1
it is now and likely to remain of little benefit to her unless she lives to a very great age '			0
judge @entity164 said that mrs @entity11 had enjoyed ' a high standard of living ' before her husband 's death but described her request for an income of £ 222,540 - a - year from his estate as ' very inflated '			0
giving her permission to appeal , however , @entity46 said : ' there seems to be a reasonable prospect of success , given the position of mrs @entity11 as a widow			2
' her full appeal will be heard by three @entity51 judges at a later date .			0

@entity8 warned sons he was ' watching ' from beyond the grave
pleaded with @entity39 and @entity40 not to allow arguments during probate
his widow @entity187 has gone to court for a larger share of his fortune
