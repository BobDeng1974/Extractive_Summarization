by @entity0 big - money recruit @entity2 was on the scoresheet as @entity4 kicked off their @entity6 campaign by easing to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity8			1
optimism was high on @entity10 with manager @entity11 taking charge of his first full campaign having overseen a fine end to last term			2
and the home side did not disappoint as goals from @entity18 and £ 2.8million striker @entity2 secured the points			1
perfect start : @entity18 is mobbed by his team - mates after putting @entity4 ahead @entity4 : @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity18 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity2			1
subs : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39			0
goals : @entity18 , @entity2 @entity8 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51			1
subs : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59			0
referee : @entity61 ( @entity62 ) a new - look @entity8 , bolstered by 14 summer recruits having dramatically avoided relegation on goal difference in may , entered the game brimming with confidence after winning all five of their pre-season fixtures			2
but @entity74 's men were found wanting versus better opposition , their woes best summed up towards the end of the first half when @entity18 was left unmarked in the area to head his side into the lead			1
it was an advantage @entity4 never looked like relinquishing , with @entity2 capping a fine debut when finishing coolly midway through the second period			1
the game began in inauspicious fashion for the hosts as @entity25 suffered an injury inside 30 seconds and was forced off			0
@entity36 , the returning @entity89 loanee deemed too unfit to start following his participation in the @entity91 for @entity92 , deputised			0
@entity93 , @entity4 pressed forward with confidence and @entity30 sent a fizzing volley just over the crossbar			0
@entity8 were suddenly camped inside their own area , @entity11 's men again going close as @entity30 's through - ball fed immediate fan favourite @entity2 - whose first - time effort just missed the target			1
the @entity102 continued to defend resolutely , although @entity30 again nearly unlocked the door when striking narrowly wide			0
pulling away : @entity26 clashes with @entity51 during a deserved victory for the hosts @entity4 finally got a reward for their efforts in the 33rd minute , however , as @entity41 failed to keep out @entity18 's powerful header from @entity28 's corner			2
not content with one , @entity4 continued to press forward and almost doubled their advantage when @entity111 hit straight at the onrushing @entity41 just after half - time			2
the goalkeeper had to be on high alert again moments later , parrying @entity26 's header wide as @entity8 almost paid the price for further dreadful set - piece defending			0
suddenly awakened , the visitors began to put together some attacks of their own			0
yet they looked vulnerable to the counter , too , as the increasingly - influential @entity2 played through @entity29 - who failed to beat @entity41 from close range for the second time			1
@entity2 would have no such problems when his chance came , slotting a controlled volley into the corner after @entity30 's initial effort had been blocked			2
the @entity131 later missed a golden opportunity to add another following a brilliantly worked set - piece with @entity30 , although few in attendance were holding that against him when the full - time whistle sounded .			0

@entity18 puts home side 1 - 0 up in first half
@entity2 finishes coolly to put his side two up in second period
£ 2.8million striker caps fine debut to seal opening *day* win
