by @entity0 published : 10:40 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 10 june 2013 rev. @entity1 has quit as vicar of @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , after parishioners disliked his evangelical style a vicar has quit after elderly parishioners mounted a whispering campaign against him for introducing ’ happy clappy ’ hymns into his church services			1
the @entity14 @entity1 had boosted congregations at his church in the picturesque @entity5 village , attracting dozens of young families and their children			1
but his efforts to modernise the church services caused a wave of resentment among older worshippers			1
and when he got them all to clap along to ‘ he ’s got the @entity27 ’ and ‘ @entity31 ‘ many older parishioners felt it was beyond the pale			1
the final straw for the vicar , known to worshippers as @entity34 , came when most of the choir boycotted a recent wedding and members of the congregation had to step in to save the day			1
last night parishioners said the popular vicar had been forced to quit after ruffling the feathers of more traditional churchgoers			1
a member of the @entity45 said : ‘ it ’s absolutely disgusting what has happened here			2
we have lost a fantastic vicar because of a minority of wicked people			2
‘ it is pure evil			2
how they can call themselves @entity57 is beyond me			2
they are simply hypocrites and they are the ones who should leave , not the vicar			0
’ one church council member , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ 99 per cent of us would have him back in a second			1
we all love him so much			0
@entity1 is a wonderful man and a wonderful vicar			1
‘ there are lots of families who only go there because of him			0
to have 50 or 60 children going to services on sunday is fantastic			1
he is the best vicar i have ever come across and he just has this way of communicating with youngsters			0
‘ it ’s a sorry state of affairs when a man like this can be driven out by a very small number of traditionalists			0
’ church leaders , including the local bishop , have spoken of their disappointment at his resignation			1
and the church choir has been temporarily disbanded as bishop @entity88 pledged to resolve ‘ issues ’ within @entity92 in the village of @entity4 , @entity5 before appointing a successor			1
@entity93 had been vicar at @entity94 for eight years after retiring as a religious studies teacher at @entity97 ’s high school in @entity98			0
last night parishioners said the popular vicar had been forced to quit after ruffling the feathers of more traditional churchgoers the historic church , which was built in 1823 , contains a @entity103 listed organ			1
the village is home to less than 900 people			0
villagers said @entity93 , 55 , who is married to @entity108 , was ‘ very popular ’ but a minority of parishioners had objected to his evangelist style			1
one church - goer said youngsters were encouraged to help pick hymns and would clap along to modern favourites			2
she said : ‘ two sundays of the month were family services but there were traditional communions and services too - he catered to everyone			1
‘ the family services were done in such a way to make it easier for the children to understand , but it still followed the church of @entity128			1
‘ at every service @entity93 always preached to everyone about giving their life to @entity133			0
he thought that was part of his evangelical mission			0
and if you had n’t already let him into your life , to do so			0
‘ he always did that - some people liked it , some people did n’t			0
the choir would sing at every service so it was a shock when they walked out at the wedding			1
’ parishioners say the tension between @entity93 and up to a dozen long - term churchgoers - some of them members of the @entity94 choir - had been brewing for more than two years			2
another churchgoer said : ‘ his style was very evangelical - it might be that that did n’t sit well with people			0
‘ he would preach like that one week but the next be very high church			2
he was trying to keep everyone happy			0
’ another said : ‘ i think it is such a shame			0
he did a beautiful service for my daughter who died in her sleep a few years back			0
he supported me and my family			2
’ @entity93 refused to comment about reasons for his resignation saying : ‘ it ’d be totally inappropriate for me to discuss this			0
’ a spokesman for the acting bishop of @entity98 , the right rev @entity88 , said : ‘ we have every intention of appointing a new vicar to the parish , but will delay the matter until issues leading to the resignation have been resolved			2
‘ the @entity168 is keen to stress that he regards @entity93 as a fine priest			0
