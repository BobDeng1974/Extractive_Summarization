by @entity0 published : 21:15 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 06:49 est , 27 december 2012 it is a newly discovered natural wonder , a living natural reef made up of 100million brightly coloured shellfish carpeting the seabed			1
but while the spectacular colony of flame shells may look like something from tropical waters , it has actually been found off @entity11 ’s coast			2
a survey of @entity13 , a sea inlet between @entity14 and the mainland , uncovered what scientists believe could be the world ’s biggest single population of the creatures			1
loch and awe : the flame shells live in giant colonies the flame shells , or @entity25 , form a large shellfish reef on the west coast of @entity11 , which could be the biggest find of its kind in the world flame shells build ' nests ' by binding gravel and shells together with thin wiry threads			2
although each measures around 4cm long , when they group together in large numbers , the sea bed is covered by a felt - like organic reef of material several centimetres thick			1
flame shell beds are found at only eight sites in @entity11 waters			2
the 1.5inch long , scallop - like species has numerous neon orange tentacles that emerge between its two shells			1
colonies create ‘ nests ’ by binding gravel and shells together with thin threads			0
according to a survey commissioned by @entity54 , the @entity13 colony covers 75 hectares ( 185 acres ) of seabed			0
this has created a living reef that supports hundreds of other species			1
flame shells are considered scarce and beds are found in only eight sites in @entity11 waters			2
as part of the work to identify new @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , @entity54 has co-ordinated a programme of eight surveys during 2012 , including @entity13 , covering more than 640 square miles of sea			0
the @entity13 survey was carried out by @entity69 on behalf of @entity54			0
dr @entity70 , of @entity69 , said : ‘ too often , when we go out to check earlier records of a particular species or habitat , we find them damaged , struggling or even gone			2
the incredible find was made in @entity13 in the @entity77 in @entity11 ‘ we are delighted that in this instance we found not just occasional patches but a huge and thriving flame shell community extending right the way along the entrance narrows of @entity13			0
’ @entity83 , of @entity84 , said : ‘ whilst we had some records of flame shells in @entity13 , we had no idea how big the bed was			0
we needed more certainty before recommending them as a protected feature of this @entity64 proposal			0
‘ it ’s great to have this new information and it ’s yet another example of the fantastic diversity of @entity11 ’s marine environment			0
’ environment secretary @entity98 said : ‘ the seas around @entity11 are a hotbed of biodiversity and the clean and cold waters support many fascinating and beautiful species			0
marine experts are ' delighted ' at the find , in a sea inlet off the @entity107 of @entity14 ‘ with @entity11 waters covering an area around five times bigger than our landmass , it ’s a huge challenge to try to understand more about our diverse and precious sea life			1
the flame shell must be considered among the most remarkable species in our waters , with a dazzling array of orange tentacles			1
’ mr @entity98 added : ‘ many would place such an exotic species in far - flung tropical reefs , not realising they dwell under the waves just off the coast of @entity14			1
‘ this important discovery may be the largest grouping of flame shells anywhere in the world			0
‘ and not only are flame shells beautiful to look at , these enigmatic shellfish form a reef that offers a safe and productive environment for many other species			1

*astonishing* natural reef found near @entity107 of @entity14
the scallop - like species have *glowing* orange tentacles
the living reef supports hundreds of other species
