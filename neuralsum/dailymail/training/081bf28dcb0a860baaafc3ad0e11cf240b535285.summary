@entity3 @entity2 , 36 , was on patrol with @entity23 in 2010 when he picked up another man 's wife for a 40 - minute tryst			1
he took his mistress back to his home in @entity29 , @entity30 , while a colleague waited outside			1
but a report into his conduct found the act did not pose a risk to public safety because he could have been back within ' a minute or two '			1
an appeals tribunal report into the incident , obtained under @entity39 by @entity40 , concluded that it was ' the sort of delay that will occur if an officer goes to the toilet or into a café to buy a cup of tea '			2
the tribunal overturned the original decision by the @entity23 panel to dismiss @entity50 , who is now a neighbourhood beat officer after he was stripped of his firearms licence			2
jenkins , who has won two awards for his bravery , was initially sacked by the force in 2011 for gross misconduct			0
but he was allowed to keep his job after an appeal concluded his gun was never out of his control because he could reach it while it was in the holster by his ankles			0
it also found he was still able to protect the public because he was contactable by radio			0
the @entity69 then questioned his reinstatement in august and said the case had undermined public confidence in the police discipline system			0
headquarters : the report into @entity50 ' dismissal from @entity23 said the act was similar to an officer taking a tea break or going to the lavatory following the decision by the @entity82 in august , the @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 , said he was ‘ bemused ’ by the findings and said the way @entity23 had dealt with the case was unacceptable			1
he said : ‘ the finding that the gun was never out of @entity50 ’s direct and immediate control because it was in a holster , attached to his trousers , which were attached to him , albeit around his ankles , is surprising			0
’ ‘ i am also bemused by the panel ’s conclusion that his conduct did not significantly downgrade the protection to the public because there was nothing to suggest he could not have been back in the police vehicle within a minute or two			1
‘ these findings can only undermine public confidence in the credibility of the police discipline system			0
’ ‘ any officer having sex on duty is unacceptable behaviour that falls well below what is expected of all police officers			2
‘ those who carry firearms are rightly subject to the highest standards of training , procedures and discipline			0
