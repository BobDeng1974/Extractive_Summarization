by @entity0 , political editor published : 19:24 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 10 june 2013 the £ 1,500 no - risk stake in @entity2 and @entity3 would be the biggest privatisation ever seen in @entity5 up to 48 million taxpayers could be offered a £ 1,500 no - risk stake in @entity2 and @entity3 in the biggest ever privatisation ever seen in @entity5			1
a blueprint published today suggests that up to £ 34billion of the government ’s £ 48billion of shares in @entity2 and @entity3 would end up in the hands of individual voters			2
every @entity5 resident over the age of 18 who has a national insurance number and is registered on the electoral roll could apply for a share			1
the scheme has been devised by centre - right think tank @entity21 and is understood to be being studied closely in the @entity23			1
an announcement of plans for a share giveaway could come in chancellor @entity28 ’s speech to @entity30 ’s @entity29 in ten days ’ time			0
today ’s report suggests that every taxpayer should be eligible to apply to be handed a ‘ free ’ stake in the two banks , which were part - nationalised by @entity35 in the banking crash of 2008 and 2009			1
they would keep the profits when the shares were sold			2
an alternative plan is for people to be able to buy shares at a discount			1
senior @entity44 believe the move will be a moment of huge political significance as it will be billed ‘ payback time ’ from the banking sector , as well as creating a new generation of shareowners			0
one described it privately as ‘ electoral catnip ’			0
mr @entity28 is said to believe a privatisation with discounted or given - away shares could rekindle the excitement of the ‘ @entity64 ’ campaign , in which five million people bought shares in @entity61 -- a move which is credited with helping the @entity44 win the 1987 general election			1
a senior @entity23 source confirmed the @entity21 proposal was ‘ one interesting idea among many ’ , though he insisted no decisions had been taken			1
today ’s report , written by @entity70 , former head of global equity strategy at @entity72 , examines all the options available to the government and concludes that a distribution of shares in both @entity2 and @entity77 to taxpayers be repaid on sale , combined with a separate sale to institutional investors , is the best solution			2
it would mean 50 to 55 per cent of shares in @entity2 and 30 per cent of shares in @entity3 being distributed to taxpayers who are able to apply for them at no initial cost			1
they would only be paid for at the time of sale			0
for taxpayers , this could mean between £ 1,100 and £ 1,650 worth of shares being allocated depending on the number of applicants			1
the report estimates that between 20 and 30 million would apply , meaning a likely stake of around £ 1,500			1
a floor price would be established at the original level the shares are sold.if the share price falls under the floor , no - one would be expected to want to sell since they would not profit at all			1
30 per cent of shares in @entity3 would be distributed to taxpayers who are able to apply for them at no initial cost one senior @entity106 described the move as ' electoral catnip '			1
it is said that the plan would be billed as ' payback time ' from the banking sector instead , taxpayers would take the profits from any rise in the share price above the floor price but would not lose any money if the share price dropped below the floor price			2
if the share price never exceeds the floor price , the shares would be returned to government ownership after ten years			2
this gives taxpayers confidence in taking on shares as there is no downside or upfront cost			2
the shares would be held in a nominee account			0
individuals can then transfer their shareholding into a personal account should they wish , providing they have paid the government the floor price			0
at the same time of the mass distribution , 25 per cent of shares in @entity2 and the remainding shares in @entity3 would be sold to institutional and retail investors			0
the @entity23 could raise approximately £ 17 - 18 billion through institutional and retail sales alone			1
the @entity23 is considering the plan			1
@entity28 is said to believe a privatisation of this kind would excite the electorate the report says that by offering a large portion of its shareholding to taxpayers in this way , the government would be able to move much if not all of the banks into private ownership in one go , at a better price than through a traditional sale , while at the same time giving the taxpayer the bulk of the upside			0
it identified flaws in other options to privatise the banks before the general election in 2015 , saying there was not enough time for a stage sale to institutional investors and the shares would have to be sold at a discount			1
a simple shares giveaway would increase the national debt by £ 50 billion and wad therefore a ‘ non-starter ’			2
‘ any privatisation has to be done in a way that will strengthen the banks and allows them to compete on a fully commercial basis when back in private hands , ’ mr @entity178 said			0
‘ in our view that means finding a solution that moves the banks quickly from the public to the private sector , while at the same time generating a stable share price and an opportunity for the banks to raise capital			0
it is also key that the taxpayer still benefits from any further rise in the share price			0
‘ a distribution to taxpayers with the government to be repaid on sale , combined with an institutional and retail placing , is the only option that allows almost all the government ’s stake in the banks to be sold ahead of a 2015 election			0
it also offers the most stable share price as distributed shares would not be sold below the price to be repaid to the government			0
this proposal will create a whole new generation of shareholders			0
we urge the chancellor to take on the doubters and move ahead with this scheme			0
’ @entity219 had indicated it would fight a full - scale shares giveaway			2
shadow chancellor @entity221 declared last month that he would oppose the coalition ’s moves to divest itself of the shares currently held by the government if it would adversely affect @entity5 ’s deficit			0
‘ a giveaway or a loss - making firesale at the current share price would add billions to the national debt at a time when poor economic growth already means borrowing is n’t coming down , ’ he said			2
the @entity23 source added : ‘ we genuinely do n’t have some secret plan for bank share sales and are not in any mad rush			1
’ the two banks have both said they expect to be ready to return to the private sector in 2014 .			0

all over 18s could apply , as long as they have national insurance number and are registered to vote
*privitisation* plan *reminiscent* of 1980s campaign when 5 million bought shares in @entity61
think tank *'s* scheme is being studied closely by the @entity23
