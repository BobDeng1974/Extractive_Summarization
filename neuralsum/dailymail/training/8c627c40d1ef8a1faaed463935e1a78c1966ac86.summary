defending champion @entity0 fell further off the pace in the third round of the @entity3 on saturday , despite an early stumble from leader @entity5			1
@entity0 began the day seven shots off the lead but in optimistic mood that a low round could get him back into contention at @entity11 , venue for the 2018 @entity13			1
however , with the overcast and windy conditions making scoring difficult , the former @entity15 champion instead found himself dropping shots at the first and fourth to slip back to one under par. struggling : @entity0 finished the day one under par and eight shots off the lead in @entity21 still finding his line : @entity0 talks to his caddy during the @entity3 in @entity21 @entity5 held a one - shot lead after a flawless opening 64 and extended his advantage to three shots thanks to a second round of 68 , despite suffering a dreaded shank on his way to a double - bogey seven on his final hole			1
and although the world number 62 could only manage a one - over - par 72 on saturday , the wet and windy conditions meant he finished the day four ahead of @entity21 's @entity35 and @entity37 's @entity36			2
@entity36 's 69 would have been even better if not for a bogey on the 18th , while @entity15 champion @entity39 is six off the lead after a 70			1
' i think since the first day he 's running away a little bit , so i guess he likes the golf course as much as i do , ' @entity39 said of @entity5 , who won his first @entity45 title in @entity46 in february			2
" so i think it will be difficult to catch him			0
' if the weather stays like this , i just need to shoot a very , very low score tomorrow			0
if you get within two or three shots of him , he might get some nerves the last three or four holes because it 's a tough finish			2
' but the way he plays golf and the way i know him , he 's a very laid - back guy so it will be difficult to catch him			2
i can only try to shoot as low as i can to be happy with myself			0
' leading the way : @entity64 dropped some shots but was still two shots clear at the top of the leaderboard @entity5 carded one bogey and eight pars on the front nine and that allowed @entity35 to claim a share of the lead when he recorded his second birdie of the day on the ninth			1
at that point the 29 - year - old from @entity77 was the only player in the field not to have dropped a shot , but a bogey promptly arrived on the 10th after he drove into the water and @entity5 holed from 10 feet for birdie for a two - shot swing			1
@entity35 bounced straight back with a birdie on the 11th but then carded five bogeys and a birdie in the next six holes , managing his only par of the back nine on the 18th			1
@entity5 was far more consistent with seven pars and a bogey on the 17th , despite struggling with a back injury which flared up during the round			1
running away with it : @entity15 champion @entity39 admits it will be tough to catch @entity5 " it 's a little tight , " the 34 - year - old said			1
" it 's been a little out of whack all week			0
luckily did n't give me a whole lot of trouble the first couple of days , but it today it turned up a bit			0
i 'm still able to swing so should be fine			0
" i got about what i deserved out of my game today			0
i did n't play that great , made a whole lot of pars and did not have nearly as many looks ( for birdie ) as i had the last couple days , but you ca n't expect to play that well for four days in a row			0
" i knew i really did n't have to do anything crazy today			0
a couple less would have been nice , but overall i 'm happy the way it went			0
