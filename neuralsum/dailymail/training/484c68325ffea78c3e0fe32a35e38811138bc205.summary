millions of @entity0 are expected to head to the stores for holiday gift shopping on @entity3 in what 's quickly becoming a new holiday tradition			1
and it 's one that 's sparked some backlash among shoppers and employees who believe @entity3 should be a time to spend with family			2
just a few years ago when a few stores started opened late on the holiday , the move was met with resistance from workers and shoppers who believed the day should be sacred			2
last year , more than dozen major retailers opened at some point on @entity3 evening			1
and this year , at least half of them - including @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 - are opening earlier in the evening on the holiday			1
' i would 've though 8 o'clock			0
never in a million years would i have thought 6 o'clock , ' @entity32 told @entity48			0

the @entity3 openings are one way retailers are trying to compete for @entity0 ' holiday dollars			1
used to be that the day after @entity3 , known as @entity64 , was when they 'd focus their sales promotions			1
