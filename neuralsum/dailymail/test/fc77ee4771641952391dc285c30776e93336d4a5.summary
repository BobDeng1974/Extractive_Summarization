from location tagging to unmonitored comments to blatant sexual harassment , a new video streaming app has all the ingredients to become a parent 's latest nightmare			1
@entity13 , @entity9 's new @entity8 app which allows users to broadcast live video and audio online , launched a week ago today and early adapters have already discovered potentially hair - raising issues with the much talked - about technology , which claims on its website that it is ' the closest thing to teleportation '			1
despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of the app , which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news , there are already a concerning number of users , particularly women , reporting that they have been sexually harassed , or trolled , while using the technology			1
streaming revolution : @entity34 , an @entity8 app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet , launched last thursday warning : app developer @entity35 is warning parents about the app 's various ' land mines ' and insists that they need to monitor their child 's use of it ( stock image ) @entity35 , app developer of the app @entity44 , told @entity46 that because @entity47 ' allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before ' , there are ' apparent dangers ' that users have to consider before accessing it			1
@entity55 , sex and relationships editor at @entity57 , noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app 's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends			1
she explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate			2
they were fully clothed , sitting on a couch and casually conversing , yet ' within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up ’ , asking for the women to ‘ show butt ’			0
while neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor , the lude comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as : ' @entity82 ? ' and ' i would soooo swipe right on both [ sic ] ! ' one particularly creepy user asked : ' do you get out of the shower to pee ? ' according to @entity47 's community guidelines , the app prohibits ' pornographic or overtly sexual content ' as well as ' explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent , illegal or dangerous activities '			1
and while a spokesperson for the app told @entity55 that @entity47 has a team dedicated to content review , there does n't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment			2
the app 's policies are , unsurprisingly , similar to @entity9 , which is currently testing out a ' quality filter ' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds			1
it 's not clear as to whether or not @entity47 will be given a similar screening system			2
but the recent reports of harassment and bullying have sparked concern among parents of many of the children and teenagers who currently have access to the app – raising questions about whether it is truly safe for young people to be using it , given that they could potentially be opening themselves up to all manner of abuse , be it of a violent , or sexual , nature			1
another startling revelation about the app , was revealed by @entity131 editor @entity130 , who was testing out the app and learned that it had a major privacy flaw			0
according to @entity130 , if users neglected to turn off the location sharing feature , their video streams would be accompanied by a ' zoomable ' map which allowed others to pinpoint their exact locations down to the intersection			0
thankfully , periscope disabled the zooming feature on the map as a part of its first system update , but the app still enables locations			1
@entity149 features : the app , which is owned by @entity9 , allows users to follow certain people ( @entity153 ) and scroll through a ' watch ' feed of live videos ( r ) mr @entity35 noted : ' periscope requires not only your camera and microphone , but access to your location [ if you want to broadcast video ]			1
this means not only are you sharing your video , you are letting other users know where you are			0
' he added : ' that means your children potentially being found by , best case , a disgruntled ex-spouse			2
the worst case clearly presents even higher levels of danger			0
you can easily search for users of the app , even if their @entity9 streams are privatized			0
' periscope does enable users to hide their location once they begin broadcasting - but many users admit they did n't think to disable the feature before starting their video stream			1
while testing the app , mr @entity35 said he watched @entity188 and his daughter ride bicycles , a @entity191 man drinking , comedian @entity192 getting his hair washed and an office learning about @entity47			1
' i do n’t know or follow any of these people on @entity9 but there it was , all live for me to watch on my train ride home , ' he said			0
and while @entity47 has provided guidelines for content , mr @entity35 noted that there does n't seem to be any ' curation on the app either ' - essentially allowing users to show whatever they want			1
users can report them , or even block , any people that they do not wish to be able to see their videos , and can also hide any or all chats any time by swiping right , scrolling to the bottom of the list of viewers and selecting ' hide chat '			0
but by then it may already too late			0
you ca n't unsee something you have already seen , especially if you are an impressionable child			0
' we ’ve all heard stories of people sending nude photos to one another either via text or other social media apps , ' mr @entity35 explained			2
' now you can easily stream nude videos			0
clearly , this opens a lot of potential land mines for parents to now have to try and control			1
' one user 's labeled his @entity47 live stream video : ' i 'm brabroadcastingom my hotel room in @entity236			2
what could be more exciting than that ? stop by and say hello ? ' another touted a live video of a ' @entity241 in @entity242 '			0
and then there is the issue of children and teens falling prey to online bullying			0
mr @entity35 said that he ' witnessed a tireless stream of anonymous people saying things that would be inappropriate for a younger audience			2
the dangers of online bullying are huge , and @entity47 , while a great app when used responsibly , allows bullying to escalate exponentially			2
' he said the app should alter its features to include stronger privacy options , the ability to block location services , curation of commentary , as well as the addition of parental controls			0
' @entity47 ’s concept is great - live streaming made easy , ' he said , before adding : ' but maybe it ’s just too easy ? '			0

the video app launched last thursday , but early adapters have already discovered potentially hair - raising issues with the technology
app developer @entity35 told @entity46 that periscope present numerous dangers to children
he warned that parents will have to ' try and control ' the various ' land mines ' present within the app 's system
