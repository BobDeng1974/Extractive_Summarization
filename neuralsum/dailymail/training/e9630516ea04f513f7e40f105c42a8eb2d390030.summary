@entity0 normally scores once a year			0
on @entity3 the @entity2 defender broke protocol and got his second goal this season against former club @entity7			1
it took the 27 - year - old just two minutes into the @entity9 of 2015 to remind us why it 's the best there is ( and why @entity12 and @entity13 can keep their winter breaks )			1
january 1 had just about everything ; goals , penalties , red cards , talking points , a twist or two , a @entity22 rant , and more than a few questionable refereeing decisions			1
was it the greatest day the @entity9 has seen since it was founded in 1992 ? that 's down to personal preference , but here are the statistics that may persuade you otherwise			2
@entity0 puts @entity2 ahead after two minutes against @entity7 in the @entity9 @entity0 celebrates his second goal of the season as @entity2 and @entity7 got @entity3 going it is just the second time in @entity35 footballing history that two sides have been joint - top alphabetically after december just twice has this happened come the turn of the year			1
@entity39 and @entity40 have identical records - sharing 46 points , 44 goals for , 19 against , plus - 25 difference			1
but @entity22 has only himself to blame for not being seven points clear in 2015			1
the @entity39 manager , in between insisting @entity9 referees are conspiring against him , has been punished by former confidant @entity49 at the @entity50			1
@entity22 on the bench at @entity52 as @entity39 went on to lose 5 - 3 against @entity53 @entity49 's goals against @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity39 have been vital in the title chase @entity58 is using @entity22 's own weapon against him after the 36 - year - old was allowed to leave @entity61 in june , ending up in @entity62 via @entity63			1
the former @entity66 midfielder 's goals against @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity39 mean he has earned @entity67 five points , and denied @entity22 two in the process			1
but there 's good news for @entity39			2
when @entity73 were tied with @entity7 on points , goals for , goals against and difference on january 10 , 2004 , @entity72 went on to win the title			1
if @entity39 and @entity40 's records remain identical come may , then both sides would need a one - off winner - takes - all match to determine the champions			1
@entity58 has been using @entity22 's own weapon against him with the on - loan @entity49 ( right ) there were 33 goals scored , the most on @entity3 since 1987 largely down to the evening 's @entity91 derby between @entity53 and @entity39 , where neutrals ( and @entity93 ) were relieved it was on television			1
and the five goals between @entity40 and @entity55 in their 3 - 2 thriller helped , too , all coming in just 16 minutes and 12 seconds			1
the early game , sadly , did not become a free - for - all , not even with @entity7 's Â£ 154million attack , but others made up for it			0
the 10 fixtures had 33 between them , the most since 1987 when 11 matches saw 34 , including a 3 - 1 win for @entity106 over @entity107 and a 3 - 1 defeat for @entity109 by @entity73			2
@entity3 almost doubled the amount of goals on december 28 , too , where just 17 goals were scored and three 0 - 0 scorelines played out			1
not the worst of welcomes to the new year			0
@entity115 scored twice for @entity53 as they went on to win 5 - 3 against @entity39 on @entity3 the eight goals at @entity52 made for an entertaining evening match on an action - packed january 1 @entity120 's men conceded five and scored three at @entity52 as @entity39 lost 5 - 3 against @entity53 12 - @entity40 11 - @entity107 , @entity121 8 - @entity122 , @entity56 , @entity123 , @entity39 7 - @entity53 , @entity124 , @entity125 6 - @entity126 , @entity7 , @entity127 5 - @entity2 , @entity128 , @entity55 , @entity129 4 - @entity73 , @entity130 3 - @entity131 the woodwork was struck 16 times - the most ever recorded on a @entity9 day since 2006/07 so , there could have been even more scored			1
among those was @entity136 who could have nicked a win for @entity2 in the second half			0
you can try and mark the 6ft 7in striker , though it often does little good			0
he rose highest , but could not been the right post			0
at @entity145 , too , there could have been more than the six goals scored between @entity147 and @entity121			1
the latter were desperately unlucky , hitting the woodwork twice in one move through @entity151 and @entity152 during the 3 - 3 draw			0
it remains @entity40 who have hit the woodwork more times than any other club ( 12 ) this season , with @entity107 and @entity121 ( both 11 ) catching up			2
@entity136 rises highest to beat @entity159 to the ball as he gets his header away for @entity2 @entity136 was among those who hit the post on @entity3 as the woodwork was struck 16 times in total @entity121 hit the woodwork twice in one move through @entity151 ( pictured ) and @entity152 during the draw @entity170 during @entity172 's 5 - 0 win over @entity173 @entity172 5 - 0 @entity173 goals : ( @entity175 10 , @entity176 18 , @entity131 55 , 58 , @entity177 90 ) att : 98,255 november 29 , 2010 @entity22 conceded five for just the second time in his career this does n't happen			1
@entity22 does n't allow teams he manages to concede five			2
to him , three is an disappointment			0
but five ? that 's what happened at @entity52 , largely down to their in - house striker			0
@entity115 , shaking loose @entity187 , scored from where he had no right to			2
it brought @entity53 level , and they went on to win 5 - 3			0
the only other time @entity22 felt this was on november 29 , 2010			1
he , then of @entity173 , lost 5 - 0 against @entity172 at the @entity193			0
' i hope this game does not affect us psychologically , ' @entity22 said in the aftermath			2
' i have spoken to the players and told them the title is not gone			0
we ca n't leave here crying			0
' @entity172 went on to win the title , never losing top spot following the 5 - 0 drubbing , and @entity173 finished four points adrift			2
@entity172 celebrate during their 5 - 0 win over @entity22 's @entity173 on november 29 , 2010 , at the @entity193 @entity173 manager @entity22 pictured during his only other defeat in which the opposition scored five goals @entity22 is not used to teams scoring five against his clubs but @entity53 managed to do so on january 1 @entity39 conceded five for just the third time in the @entity9 era speaking of five , it was just the third time @entity39 conceded so many in a @entity9 game			1
the others ? @entity124 beat them 5 - 1 on september 21 , 1996 , at @entity218 , and @entity73 beat them 5 - 3 on october 29 , 2011 , at @entity61 with a @entity220 hat - trick			0
@entity220 scores one of three against @entity39 as they won 5 - 3 at @entity61 in 2011 @entity222 scores past stranded @entity39 goalkeeper @entity223 en route to the 5 - 3 win at @entity61 @entity73 celebrate during their iconic 5 - 3 win at @entity61 , the second time @entity39 lost via five goals @entity124 2 - 2 @entity130 , sep 2 , 2002 @entity124 2 - 2 @entity229 , sep 11 , 2002 @entity124 surrendered a two - goal lead at @entity218 for just the third time in the @entity9 era @entity218			1
it 's all designed to scare the living daylights out of visitors to the red half of @entity240			0
that is partly why they have only let a two - goal lead slip at their iconic home twice before			2
sadly for @entity246 , @entity56 were fearless on @entity3 , even after going 2 - 0 down			2
@entity248 's men fought back after two dubious penalties , both scored by the soon - to - be departing @entity251 , claiming a 2 - 2 draw against last season 's @entity9 runners up			1
when else did @entity124 surrender a two - goal lead ? @entity130 , when @entity256 and @entity257 scored late goals , and @entity229 after a @entity260 brace			1
those two , strangely , came within a little more than a week of each other - @entity130 on september 2 , 2002 , and @entity229 on september 11			0
@entity251 scored two penalties against @entity56 but @entity124 let their two - goal lead slip @entity246 oversaw the third time in @entity9 history that @entity124 let a two - goal slip at @entity218 four referees that may have explained themselves if they were allowed to do so : and one more thing ... officials were at their downright worst			1
the state of the decisions on @entity3 suggested one or two of the referees had a little too much sherry the night before			2
but schadenfreude can be a funny thing			0
some of them , so ridiculous , that they were laughable			0
take , for example , poor old @entity281			0
the @entity56 defender takes one to the face from @entity284 , then hears @entity285 blow his whistle for a penalty			0
referees are n't held accountable for their mistakes in the modern game , and this is where common sense should prevail			0
it is calling for officials to be allowed to speak after games , whether to apologise for a decision or explain it			0
they 're only human after all			0
@entity56 players protest after @entity285 awards @entity124 a questionable penalty at @entity218 @entity2 players surround @entity304 after the official missed @entity307 's blatant handball @entity308 handles the ball outside of the area but referee @entity311 missed it in the fifth minute			0

it is just the second time in @entity35 footballing history that two clubs have had identical records at the top after december
@entity39 and @entity40 have 46 points each and a 25 *+* goal difference
@entity22 conceded five for just the second time in his career
the 33 goals scored were the most on @entity3 since 1987
@entity39 conceded five for just the third time in the @entity9 era
