two - and - a - half metre carpet python was found slithering up the side of the back door outside a @entity23 home ' it brought a smile to my face when i saw him , ' mr @entity15 told @entity28			1
' it was awesome because normally pythons are found curled up behind someone 's cupboard but this little fella was fully stretched out and reaching upwards across the brick wall			0
' he was holding himself up by just the tip of its tail , which is something i had n't seen before			1
' earlier in the day , the homeowner spotted the reptile but he managed to move it to the back of the block and away from the property but he spotted it against the brick wall shortly after 8pm			2
' i 'd imagine the male snake might have been trying to get into the roof because he caught a female snake 's pheromone trail , which is a scent that females release			2
' snake catcher @entity15 came to the rescue when he was called to a home on the @entity19 the snake catcher was amazed at what he saw , that he took to his @entity58 business page and posted a joke after his catch			1

and i love snakes for different reasons - like the venomous ones give me an adrenaline kick when i catch them , ' he said			2
when it doubt about spotting a snake , mr @entity15 suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance mr @entity15 has been quite busy during the summer season , saying he received 15 phone calls by friday afternoon and catching and relocating seven of them from people 's homes			1

' we try to release them in the same geographical area and i do n't like to take them too far away from where they were found			0
but it has to be a far distance away so they do n't come back , ' he said			0
