one of the four smothered 21 - year - old @entity13 while the others held her down , apparently in an attempt to drive out the ‘ jinn ’ spirit from her body			1
the killers included her husband , @entity21 – who later claimed she suffocated herself – his parents , @entity23 and @entity24 , both 51 , and his brother in law @entity26			1
the murder of the isolated young woman was said to have been instigated by @entity6 ’s parents			2
the four were convicted in july following a three - month trial after a jury ruled they had deliberately smothered her			2
mr @entity35 handed them mandatory life terms yesterday			0
he said that , while the murder conviction left no room for doubt about what had happened at the family home in @entity43 , @entity44 , the prosecution had been unable to ‘ say for sure ’ what the motives behind the killing had been			1
the court heard @entity6 , who suffers from a genetic condition which has left him deformed , married his bride in an arranged ceremony in her homeland of @entity54			0
this was 14 months before she died while six months pregnant with their first child			1
@entity44 @entity58 heard that a day before her death in the early hours of a july 2009 morning , mrs @entity6 , who spoke no @entity62 , had sounded ‘ stressed ’ when she called her parents to tell them her husband – and others in their neighbourhood – had been suggesting she may have become pregnant during a solo trip to @entity54			1
but the judge said a ‘ less unlikely explanation for what happened ’ was that the defendants believed @entity6 had been possessed by a jinn – a mischievous spirit mentioned in the @entity74 – ‘ and that they deliberately smothered her in order to get rid of the jinn ’			2
the judge added : ‘ that ’s not an easy thing for those of us in the @entity86 to understand , but the evidence ( from the trial ) was that a belief in jinns is widespread in the community in which they lived			0
’ during the trial , prosecutor @entity93 said family members had told police a person had been present at the house praying ‘ to get the spirit out of her ’			2
@entity101 : husband @entity102 , mother - in - law @entity24 , brother - in - law @entity26 , and father - in - law @entity23 @entity6 claimed his wife had ‘ suffocated herself by putting her hand in her mouth and she tried to strangle herself ’ and that his parents and @entity26 , 24 , who all lived at the house , were trying to hold mrs @entity6 down to stop her from harming herself			1
ambulance staff discovered mrs @entity111 in a bedroom with bruising to her arms and face			0
she died shortly after being taken to hospital at around 4.30am			0
prosecutors said that while ‘ complex cultural beliefs ’ underpinned the defence case , the defendants had given untruthful accounts			0
the court heard @entity6 suffered from @entity122 , a rare genetic disorder which means the neck is shortened			0
however , it was alleged his bride had willingly entered into the arranged marriage , despite his deformity			0
@entity101 : @entity21 ( left ) and his parents , pictured before a previous court hearing in april , were all convicted of murdering @entity6 defence barristers yesterday said that at the most , the defendants were guilty of a desire to cause ‘ really serious bodily injury ’ , and not death			2
@entity23 and @entity136 , who the judge said were ‘ more likely to have instigated what was done to @entity6 ’ , were sentenced to a minimum term of 15 years each			1
their son and @entity26 , who is married to the couple ’s daughter , were sentenced to a minimum of 13 years			1
@entity26 was said to have acted like a ‘ dutiful son - in - law ’ , who , like @entity6 , ‘ went along ’ with what the couple thought should be done			1
@entity6 muttered ‘ i loved her ’ as his father guided him out of the dock			0
scene : @entity6 , who was six months pregnant was found smothered to death in this house in @entity44 in 2009 detective inspector @entity155 of @entity156 , who investigated the case , described it as ‘ tragic and deeply upsetting ’			1
he added : ‘ it is unthinkable that those who she was closest to would take her life in the belief she had been possessed by evil spirits			0
’ in a statement , mrs @entity6 ’s family said their loved one was a ‘ happy , confident and beautiful young woman ’			0
they hoped the case would help ‘ raise awareness of the issues faced by @entity6 and young people like her ’ , adding : ‘ we need to empower people who are vulnerable and isolated to seek help in these circumstances			0
