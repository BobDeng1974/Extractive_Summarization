the disorientated animal can be seen trying to get into a lift and turning round in circles after it went into the @entity9 in @entity10			1
it appears to be having difficulty with staying upright on the slippery tiles of the hotel lobby where it knocked over plants and kicked dents in the walls			1
moments earlier , it had been seen bolting across the car park of a nearby store , dodging attempts along the way to lasso it with a tow rope			1
the horse , which was limping and sweating , was finally snared when @entity41 arrived on the scene			1
officers brought the horse under control and returned it to its owner , but sadly the animal later had to be put down			1
@entity49 , director of sales at the hotel , said : ' i saw two police officers when i arrived at 9.50am and there were a lot of people standing around the hotel looking bemused			2
' the horse tried to get into the lift and then it reversed out again			2
it was stressed and frightened			0
' it did a lot of damage to the lobby			0
it made some dents in the wall and knocked over plants but the staff were worried about the horse			1
' distressed : the horse stunned guest and staff at the hotel as it looked for a safe refuge elevator going up : as the doors to the lift open the runaway horse tries to get inside the horse had earlier run past a nearby @entity82 store and escaped the clutches of duty manager @entity84			1

just then , it appeared and ran around the car park			0

i told one of the girls to throw it some fruit to keep it there			0
' the horse then made its way to a @entity111 hardware shop and a @entity113 ’s supermarket			0
no place to hide : the cramped environs of the lift were too small for the distressed nag , which backs out mr @entity84 added : ' @entity111 have a glass window and it must have been confused thinking it was another horse			1
