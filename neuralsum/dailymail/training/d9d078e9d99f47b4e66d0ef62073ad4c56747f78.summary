@entity1 's sister says the prime minister was the most supportive of their family when she left her husband of 20 years after falling in love with a woman despite him not supporting same - sex marriage			1
@entity9 had what looked like the ' perfectly happy suburban marriage ' with four beautiful children until she met @entity13 in 2003 when their sons went to the same school			1
' i grew up in an environment where there was never any opportunity from me to pursue a same sex relationship - it was n't something that was ever even considered remotely , she said on the feed			0
' but as soon as i met @entity25 i knew she was somebody i was attracted to			0
' the @entity27 councillor is a staunch member of the @entity29 and may soon enter @entity31 politics herself but does support marriage equality unlike her beloved brother			0
' @entity1 was , out of all of my immediate family members , the most supportive - people raise my eyebrows when i say this but it is the honest truth , ' she said			1
' when i told him what was going on his response was " what ever you think you have to do i will support you "			0
' @entity25 said she has never been treated as an outcast in the @entity1 household			2
' outwardly and from the love he has shown me - he certainly has n't made me feel as if i 'm not welcome and i 'm not loved , ' she said			0
despite mr @entity1 's strong traditional beliefs about marriage he is accepting of his sister 's gay relationship however , this does not mean that the couple are happy about mr @entity1 's stance on marriage equality			1
' of course it hurts and that 's why @entity9 and i stood our ground , ' @entity25 said			1
' i think he 's wrong but he 's entitled to his view and it would be great if he turned around tomorrow and said " i 've had a change of heart " , ' @entity9 added			2
@entity9 was also quick to defend her brother 's view on the divisive issue			1
' he 's not saying that he does n't see my relationship with @entity25 as valid , ' she said			2
' he 's just saying that he does n't believe that we should come under this umbrella of the institution of marriage because as he sees marriage ...			0
he sees it as that it has to be between a man and a woman			0
' although the women accept mr @entity1 's stance on gay marriage they hope he will one day change his mind this is not to say if same - sex marriage was passed as a law that mr @entity1 would n't attend a wedding for the couple			1
' he may not want it to be legalised but if it were he has told us he would be at our marriage , ' @entity25 said			2
and mr @entity1 playing a pivotal role within the ceremony has also not been ruled out ' @entity1 - i do n't know maybe - we will see him in a little blue velvet cap , we 'll wait and see , ' @entity25 said			1
@entity25 ( left ) said she has never felt anything but loved and welcome by mr @entity1 ( second from left ) both women are the first to admit that it was not an easy decision to completely turn their worlds upside down to be together			1
' we were both married and that meant we had to make very difficult decisions about our relationships of course with our ex-husbands and also about what that meant for our children - it 's indescribably difficult , ' @entity9 said			2
' to suddenly kind of dump on people who have n't gone through the inner process that you 've gone through that " hey guys i 'm really sorry but this it not how it works for me " is a terrible thing			0
' @entity25 said coming out is a big step whether you 're a @entity133 - a late life lesbian - or a @entity135 - a whole life lesbian			0
' i was terrified i could n't imagine how i was going to manage the outfall of emotion that was going to come with this decision and the hurt , ' she said			0
' but i knew the love that i had for @entity9 was something that i could n't live without			0
' the couple say they 'd consider mr @entity1 as their page boy in a blue velvet cap if they got married one day			1
