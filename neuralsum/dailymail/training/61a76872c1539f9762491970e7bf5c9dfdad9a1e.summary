more than half of babies are now born to mothers aged over 30 , a report revealed yesterday			1
and one in five had mothers over 35 , according to a breakdown of official data from the @entity7			1
the increasing age of motherhood means that the number of women having families in their late 30s or older could soon overtake those under 25			0
as a result , most babies born last year will have a mother in her 40s by the time they go to secondary school			0
at the same time a sharp drop in young mothers will mean fewer than one secondary school child in 20 will have a mother still in her late 20s in a decade ’s time			0
the @entity7 report also showed a growing divide between the lifestyles of the new majority group of older mothers and those who still opt to have children before 25			1
the average age of mothers has risen across the board , notably for the first child reaching 28.1 years more than two - thirds of older mothers have married and their babies are born into traditional families , the breakdown showed			1
but among the diminishing number of mothers in their early 20s , only one in five are married – and the figure was even higher for those under 20			0
the report said : ‘ almost all women – 96 per cent – aged under 20 who gave birth in 2013 were not married			2
‘ in contrast , at ages 30 to 39 the majority of women giving birth were married , with only 32 per cent of births outside marriage			2
’ yesterday ’s figures showed that 51 per cent of all newborns in @entity68 and @entity69 last year had mothers over the age of 30 – up from an average age of 29.8 in 2012			1
the figure has been rising since the mid- 1970s , when a woman typically gave birth at an average age of 26.4			1
a first - time mother is now typically 28.3 years old			1
at the same time , the number of births to women under 25 is falling fast			2
just over one in five babies – 148,855 in total – were born to younger women last year – half the number of 40 years ago			0
however , the number of births to women over 35 climbed to 140,658 – a level last seen during and following the @entity87 at a time of enormous disruption to family lives			2
the great majority of babies , more than 400,000 , were born to women aged between 25 and 39			0
the @entity7 report said the ages of mothers has been rising since 1973 , reflecting the increasing number of women who have been delaying childbearing to later ages			1
among the factors said to have influenced decisions over childbirth were ‘ the instability of partnerships ’			0
births to unmarried women in their 30s have risen slower over the past 20 years than those in their 20s or their 40s			0
overall just under half – 47 per cent – of babies were born outside marriage , compared to more than nine in ten in the early 1960s .			0

in 2013 , 51 *%* of all live births were to mothers aged 30 and over
average age of first time mothers was hit record high of 28.3 years
