by @entity0 stress : the study found that children as young as one year old can pick up on negative emotions as if being a mother was n’t stressful enough			1
scientists say that stress is contagious and can be passed from mother to child			1
they showed that 12 - month - old boys and girls not only pick up that their mother is under pressure , they also start to become anxious themselves			2
the researchers said : ‘ before infants are verbal and able to express themselves fully , we can overlook how exquisitely attuned they are to the emotional tenor of their caregivers			0
‘ your infant may not be able to tell you that you seem stressed or ask you what is wrong , but our work shows that , as soon as she is in your arms , she is picking up on the bodily responses accompanying your emotional state and immediately begins to feel in her own body your own negative emotion			2
’ the @entity28 , researchers asked 69 mothers to come into the lab with their babies , who were around a year old			1
the babies were taken to a playroom , while their mothers made a five - minute speech and then took part in a question and answer session			1
some of the women received encouragement as they spoke , while others were faced with frowns and crossed arms			0
a third group made their speech to an empty room			0
the women were then reunited with their babies and the children ’s heart rate measured			2
the women whose speeches had received negative feedback felt more stressed – and their babies picked up on this , with their heart rates speeding up within minutes of sitting on their mother ’s lap. and the more pressured the woman felt , the greater the effect on the child , the journal @entity59 reports			1
mechanism : it is thought the babies may pick up on changes in tone of voice , touch or smell to work out their mother 's emotions lead researcher @entity72 said : ‘ our earliest lessons about how to manage stress and strong negative emotions in our day - to - day lives occur in the parent - child relationship			1
‘ our research shows that infants " catch " and embody the physiological residue of their mothers ’ stressful experiences			1
’ it is thought the infants may have reacted to a change in their mother ’s voice , touch or facial expression			0
even the smell of sweat might have an effect			0
such research may help shed light on how children are affected by their parent 's health			0
the researchers said : ‘ a common question in public health circles is how stress and social environment “ gets under the skin ” to affect health both at an individual and at a familial level			0
‘ with this admittedly modest study , we show a possible mechanism for how stress is transmitted from parent to child			0
