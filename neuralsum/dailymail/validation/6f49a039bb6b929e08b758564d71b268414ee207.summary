women are grossly underrepresented in professional football , both in terms of tv coverage of female games and in the number of women working in the male section of the sport			1
those that do venture into men 's football are often subjected to regular abuse - according to the campaign group @entity13 , two thirds of females working in the industry have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment			1
so a female lineswoman who was filmed talking back to the @entity21 footballer @entity20 during the @entity23 match on sunday has been heralded a hero by fellow members of her sex			1
but @entity20 is not happy with the decision and heads over to @entity28 to give her a dressing down			1
unimpressed with the attack , @entity28 takes it upon herself to follow @entity20 back down the pitch , arguing back furiously			1
shocked by the comeback , @entity20 then walks off with a wave of his hand , so @entity28 heads back to her post with a fuming backwards glance			1
the clip has since been shared hundreds of times on social network sites			2
@ @entity50 wrote on @entity52 ' @entity51 has made my day she was not having it			2
' another said : ' @entity57 lineswoman puts abusive player back in his box			1
' @entity28 is furious as she follows @entity20 up the pitch as @entity20 is shocked into heading back onto the pitch , @entity28 heads back to her post , shooting a glowering look back at her opponent it is n't the first time in recent years that a lineswoman has been headline news			1
in january 2011 , tv commentators @entity70 and @entity72 , who apparently believed their microphones were switched off , were recorded making disparaging remarks about @entity75 , 25 , before @entity78 ’s @entity77 clash with @entity79			2
commenting on ms @entity75 , mr @entity72 said : ‘ somebody better get down there and explain offside to her			2
’ mr @entity70 , a former @entity84 international footballer , replied : ‘ can you believe that ? a female linesman			1
women do n’t know the offside rule			2
’ mr @entity72 replied : ‘ course they do n’t			2
i can guarantee you there will be a big one today			0
' @entity92 ( @entity78 manager @entity93 ) will go potty			0
this is n’t the first time , is it ? did n’t we have one before ? ’ @entity70 ’s contract was immediately terminated by @entity100 ' managing director @entity99 for unacceptable behaviour , while keys resigned soon after			0

to substitute her income as a referee , @entity28 has launched a pancake delivery service with her mother @entity122 called @entity123 , which sells 29 different recipes			0

' her support has been very good			0
' although she is well respected in the game , @entity28 continues to suffer abuse from men in the game occasionally			0
during one incident in 2013 , a footballer complained about one of her decisions and assaulted her			1
