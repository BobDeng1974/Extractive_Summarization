cross-channel tensions over @entity2 's plan to claw back powers from @entity4 were laid bare today , as @entity6 president @entity5 said helping the prime minister was ' not a priority '			1
mr @entity5 said giving the @entity10 people a say on leaving the @entity11 was ' not urgent ' and would do little to assist mr @entity2 's push for reform			1
the @entity15 spat was being played out as @entity17 and @entity18 peers in the @entity19 killed off a @entity20 which would legislate for mr @entity2 's referendum			2
awkward : @entity2 and @entity5 tried to look relaxed at @entity23 barely an hour after they clashed over the need to reform the @entity11 after tense talks at the summit prime minister @entity2 took @entity6 president @entity5 to @entity23 at @entity27 in @entity28 for lunch during a tense press conference in which mr @entity5 was also challenged about his private life , mr @entity2 rejected the @entity6 's position , insisting there was ' no doubt ' that he would renegotiate a new @entity11 relationship before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
it was all smiles as mr @entity2 greeted mr @entity5 at the start of an @entity41 summit but deep divisions over @entity43 and the economy soon emerged			1
mr @entity45 made clear he has no intention of helping mr @entity2 in his bid to secure a new settlement with the @entity11 through a @entity50 change before staging a referendum			1
speaking at a press conference after the talks , mr @entity5 said : ' @entity6 would like the @entity10 to remain within in the @entity11			1
@entity6 would like to have a more effective @entity43 which can attain the objectives which we consider to be essential : growth , employment , energy and of course the capacity to bring in techniques for tomorrow and protect our population			2
' but he rejected the mr @entity2 's plea for urgent action to renegotiate the power @entity4 currently wields : ' @entity6 would like the @entity67 to be better co-ordinated , better integrated			1
and if there are going to be amendments of the text we do n’t think for the time being that they are urgent			0
' we feel that revising the @entity50 is not a priority for the time being			0
' tense : @entity10 prime minister @entity2 hosted mr @entity5 for the one - day summit at @entity78 but the two men clashed about reforming @entity43 but mr @entity2 contradicted his guest , insisting he would plough on with his plan , which has already attrracted the support of @entity84 's @entity83			1
the @entity76 said : ' @entity43 needs to change and @entity43 is changing			0
just as the @entity67 is changing so @entity10 wants change in @entity43			2
‘ my position absolutely remains that we want to see change , we want to see that renegotiation and that will involve elements of treaty change			0
' i believe that it will be done and i believe that it will be important for @entity43 and important for @entity96 people really need to know in the @entity10 is that the in - out referendum that i will hold if i am prime minister will happen by the end of 2017			2
there can not be any doubt about it			0
' @entity6 president @entity5 was seen running out of the pub where he met @entity2 for lunch the @entity6 appeared to want a quick getaway after a day which saw him clash with mr @entity2 on @entity43 and face tricky questions about his love life @entity17 's @entity43 spokesman @entity108 said : ' twelve months on from his @entity110 speech , @entity2 's referendum policy is already fraying at the seams			1
his own backbenchers are baying for more , while other @entity11 members have dismissed his arbitrary timetable of 2017			2
' @entity43 does need to change , but the @entity10 's partners are already ruling out treaty change on the arbitrary timetable that @entity2 has set out			1
' @entity2 's approach to @entity43 risks leaving the @entity10 more isolated in the @entity11 and undermines @entity10 's ability to secure much - needed reform in @entity43			1
' however @entity17 faces accusations of being anti-democratic after unelected peers threw out a backbench @entity20 which would have enshrined a referendum in law			0
peers voted by 180 to 130 , majority 50 , to end the debate of the @entity130 at committee stage in the @entity19			0
the debate could resume next week but , with only one sitting friday left in the @entity135 , it is now impossible for the @entity20 to become law			0
@entity140 chief whip in the @entity19 , @entity137 of @entity138 , said : ' @entity17 killed the @entity20			2
' @entity10 's prime minister @entity2 greets @entity6 's president @entity5 at @entity78 the two men have struck deals on energy and defence but are bitterly divided on plans to curb the powers of the @entity11 touchdown : @entity6 president @entity5 arrives at @entity78 for the @entity151 hosted by @entity2 after formal talks on the base followed by the press conference the mr @entity5 and mr @entity2 men held a working lunch at @entity23 in the pm 's @entity158 constituency			1
mr @entity5 appeared to enjoy the visit to the boutique @entity161 gastropub on the banks of the @entity164 , which has featured in @entity165 and belongs to the last surviving @entity167 sister			2
but he was later seen sprinting out of the door to his waiting car			0
the atmosphere could well have been frosty , with aides to mr @entity5 claiming @entity10 will have to wait ‘ years ’ before it is able to rewrite the terms of its membership of the @entity11			1
it has also emerged that the @entity177 are considering featuring mr @entity5 on election posters as the to highlight his close links to @entity180			2
a senior @entity140 source has revealed that mr @entity5 was viewed as a ‘ secret weapon ’ that would be deployed to drive home the argument that @entity17 can not be trusted to run the economy			1
‘ @entity180 said he wanted to do to @entity10 what @entity5 was doing to @entity6 , ’ the source said			1
‘ but just look at what @entity5 has done - the @entity6 economy is a basket case and even @entity5 is having to talk about austerity			1
' the @entity191 expects the @entity10 economy to grow by 2.4 per cent this year , more than double the 0.9 per cent forecast for @entity6			1
while a surge in jobs has seen unemployment here fall to 7.1 per cent , across the channel it has soared to 11 per cent			0
@entity19 prices in the year to november were up 3.6 per cent in the @entity10 , compared to a 1.4 per cent fall in @entity6			1
mr @entity5 is without a first lady after revelations he was having an affair with actress @entity203			2
after it emerged he had travelled to a @entity206 love nest on a moped , he announced his split from @entity209			0
he officially ‘ fired ’ her on saturday – signalling the end of her time as first lady in a curt 18 - word statement			0
@entity6 officials have said it is very unlikely that mr @entity5 will support mr @entity2 's plan to reform the @entity11 before a 2017 referendum in @entity10 mr @entity2 and president @entity5 will agree further defence co-operation on the development of new armed drones			1
but ahead of the talks mr @entity5 ’s spokesman said it was ‘ very , very unlikely ’ that any treaty changes will be in place before 2017 , when mr @entity2 has pledged an in / out referendum on @entity11 membership			1
and he said all the talk of a referendum would frighten investors away from @entity10			0
in a briefing for journalists in @entity206 ahead of the summit , the president ’s spokesman said any treaty change unlikely before 2017			0
‘ this does n’t mean we wo n’t one day require treaties to be revised for the requirements of economic monetary union , but it is very , very unlikely this will be compatible with the @entity10 political calendar , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s in our interests that @entity10 remains within @entity43 , but it is not by changing the treaties or rules will negotiate its place in the @entity11			2
it is in our interests that @entity10 remains within @entity43 but that can not happen at the price of dismantling @entity43			0
’ happier times : @entity5 and @entity209 on the night he was elected @entity6 president the official went on to warn that if the next @entity263 agrees to a referendum , companies will be less willing to invest in the @entity10 as the date for the vote approaches			1
he said : ‘ the more the question becomes concrete in @entity10 national debate , the more investors and the business community warn what a @entity10 out of @entity43 would mean			0
‘ when investors talk , they want to access the @entity43 market through the @entity10			0
this access presupposes following a certain number of rules to maintain balance in @entity43			0
‘ if these rules are not wanted in the @entity10 , it will no longer have access to [ the @entity43 market ]			0
’ pub diplomacy : @entity282 sought to win over @entity6 president @entity283 in 2000 with a pint in the @entity286 restaurant in the @entity288 's constituency in @entity289 ahead of a summit in @entity6 in 2003 mr @entity282 repeated the trick , taking @entity293 president @entity292 to the @entity295 pub in his constituency the two men announced that defence companies from the two countries will carry out a two - year study on building armed drones for their countries ’ military			1
the ‘ entente frugale ’ military agreement between @entity6 and the @entity10 was first signed in 2010 , as the two countries attempted to save money following the credit crunch depression			2
they will now go further and will work together on developing a predator - type drone			0
they announced greater cooperation on anti-ship missiles and underwater mine detectors .			0
