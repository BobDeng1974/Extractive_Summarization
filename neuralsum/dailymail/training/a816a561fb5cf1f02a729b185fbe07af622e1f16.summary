by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 15:45 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 15:53 est , 8 november 2013 @entity2 is gearing up for a series of votes on measures that could upend the entire @entity7 scheme , as both the @entity8 and @entity9 now have bills that would allow @entity1 to keep their health insurance policies in the face of the @entity7 , no matter what			1
in a 2009 speech to the @entity15 – one of many he made in defense of his insurance overhaul law – president @entity19 pledged that ' if you like your health - care plan , you ’ll be able to keep your health - care plan , period			1
no one will take it away , no matter what			0
' now , in the wake of @entity19 's public apology to millions of @entity1 who have received cancellation letters from their insurers despite his promises , four pieces of legislation – two in each house of @entity2 – are gathering steam to force the government to keep its word			1
it 's not just anti-obamacare republicans who are pushing the proposals			0
sen. @entity42 , a liberal @entity43 who voted for the @entity7 in 2009 , is up for re-election in 2014			1
like many @entity45 who fear public anger over the law , she is moving to political redefine herself as an oath - keeper			0
' all four face tough re-election battles , and campaign - watchers say their group - pivot away from the @entity8 is a matter of political survival			1
' @entity64 , like the others , has to watch his back , ' a @entity76 campaign operative in @entity65 told @entity79			2
' they all understand that the longer the @entity7 mess drags on , the more their votes for it in 2009 will hurt them			2
' if it should become law , the @entity45 ' proposal would allow taxpayers to keep any individual health care plan they were enrolled in as of december 31 , 2013			1
' any such coverage shall be deemed to be a grandfathered health plan for purposes of the @entity7 , ' the bill reads			1
it also guarantees that ' grandfathered ' plans would , by definition , meet the @entity7 law 's minimum coverage requirements			1
president @entity19 said thursday that he 's ' sorry ' some @entity1 are losing their current health insurance plans as a result of the @entity7 , despite his promise that no one would have to give up a plan they liked the idea of grandfathered plans was a part of the @entity7 that promised to protect @entity1 with existing health plans they wanted to keep , and the president took great pains to sell the law to the public based on that assurance			1
but in the wake of the law 's looking implementation , insurers have mailed millions of policy cancellation notices			0
most cite the @entity7 law as the reason			2
@entity45 blocked a @entity76 measure in 2010 that would have eliminated @entity7 's grandfather clause			1
@entity76 senators predicted at the time that it would , by design , cause as many as 69 per cent of businesses to lose thir group policies and force them to participate in government - run marketplaces instead			1
@entity125 sen. @entity124 warned at the time that ' only in the @entity127 could you get away with telling the people if you like what you have you can keep it , and then pass regulations six months later that do just the opposite and figure that people are going to ignore it			0
' @entity19 himself has pivoted in recent days , adding a caveat to his oft - repeated ' if you like your plan , you can keep your plan ' commitment that lines up with @entity124 's forecast			2
' if you had one of these plans before the @entity7 came into law and you really liked that plan , what we said was you can keep it – if it has n't changed since the law passed , " he claimed on nov. 4 during a @entity127 speech to supporters			1
but facing a public backlash and some analysts ' predictions that the number of cancelled insurance policies could swell to as many as 12 million , @entity19 changed tack a second time with an apology on thursday			1
' i am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me , ' he told @entity169			0
@entity65 sen. @entity64 , another @entity170 facing angry voters at home , has signed on to @entity42 's bill in order to put distance between himself and the unpopular @entity7 law @entity178 rep. @entity177 ( @entity55 ) has chaired contentious hearings about the @entity7 's disastrous implementation to date , and @entity8 speaker @entity181 ( r ) is expected to bring his bill to the floor soon the @entity42 bill is not alone			1
a second @entity9 version and two separate @entity8 proposals mirror and predate hers , increasing the likelihood that one of the proposals will gain enough traction to be taken seriously , and soon			2
the other @entity9 bill , the ' if you like @entity194 , you can keep it @entity60 , ' is co-sponsored by 38 republicans including its author , @entity197 sen. @entity196			0
its approach is similar to @entity42 's , but also guarantees individuals the right to add family members to their grandfathered plans			2
it also protects employers as they add new employees to existing group insurance policies			0
the @entity196 bill has a companion measure in the @entity8 , with 34 co-sponsors so far			1
' more than a million @entity1 have been notified that the plans they like with the coverage they have chosen have been canceled , ' @entity196 complained			2
' millions more @entity1 will have the plans of their choice canceled in months to come			2
' @entity1 , he said , ' do n't want @entity7 destroying what they have and what they like			2
' @entity218 chairman @entity177 , a @entity178 @entity76 , has introduced a separate measure , the ' @entity220 of 2013			2
' it 's a more streamlined bill that extends only through the end of 2014 , and would need to be renewed annually			0
no worries ? @entity8 deputy press secretary @entity224 , with @entity19 on @entity225 , reassured reporters that 1 million @entity1 with canceled insurance policies will qualify for @entity228 instead backup plan : sen. @entity196 has his own @entity9 bill , and has gathered the support of most of his fellow @entity233 @entity177 , however , has 88 co-sponsors on his side , including several members of the @entity8 leadership			1
@entity238 reported wednesday that @entity8 majority leader @entity239 had ' announced via @entity240 that the bill would get a vote ' in the coming week , but that tweet does not appear on @entity239 's account			1
“ many @entity1 are now learning the sad reality that their current plan will no longer exist beginning on january 1			0
... this legislation is about providing folks the peace of mind that they will be allowed to continue their current coverage if they so choose , ' @entity177 said in a statement last week			0
@entity42 accompanied the president on his trip to @entity255 on friday , and @entity8 deputy press secretary @entity256 told reporters aboard @entity225 that he 's open to legislative fixes like hers that address what he called a ' gap ' in the law			0
' the president has said for years now that he is open to working with members of @entity2 that have a genuine interest in trying to strengthen the @entity7 , ' @entity224 said			0
' that 's been true for years now , and it ’s true today			0
' @entity224 also tried to downplay the epidemic of cancellation letters , saying that ' about a million of them ' have gone to @entity1 ' who otherwise would qualify for @entity272			0
' there 's a wealth of differences between private health insurance coverage and the publicly funded @entity272 system , however : many hospitals and doctors wo n't treat @entity272 patients , citing low reimbursement rates and administrative red tape involved with processing claims			1
millions of @entity1 have lost their individual health insurance plans since the @entity7 became law ; a website called mycancellation.com is publishing some of the bad - news letters even military veterans are n't exempt from @entity7 's cancellation axe , which may affect as many as 12 million @entity1 who buy their medical insurance on the individual market @entity42 introduced her bill on monday , reading a dramatic insurance cancellation letter on the floor of the @entity9			1
' this is a letter that thousands of people are getting , ' she said			0
' and this letter never should have gone out – because we said to people if you had insurance that you like , you could keep it			0
' ' we did n’t say if you had insurance that you like that ... did n’t meet the minimum standards , you could keep it			0
we just said , and the president said over and over , if you have insurance and you like the insurance you have , you can keep it			0
... that ’s the single focus of my bill .			0
