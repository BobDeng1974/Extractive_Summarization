@entity0 has become a byword for expensive transfers and world - class players once again in recent years with @entity5 and @entity6 passing through the club and restoring some of the lustre of the @entity9 and @entity10 years			1
the glamour associated with @entity0 had faded considerably when @entity13 owner @entity12 took over in 2011 , when the club were languishing in the @entity16 second division			2
but having finished second to @entity17 last season , @entity12 has scaled back investments , selling @entity5 to @entity20 and loaning @entity6 to @entity21 as the club attempt to establish themselves on an even keel			1
@entity6 was released by @entity0 with @entity21 paying his £ 285,000 - a - week wages after shining in the @entity26 , @entity5 joined @entity20 for £ 63m last summer promotion under @entity28 in 2013 and an outlay of £ 140million , which also included the likes of @entity31 , brought its own problem , with some @entity16 league sides complaining that @entity0 ’s tax arrangements — foreign players such as @entity36 pay almost no income tax — constituted an unfair advantage			1
eventually , @entity0 paid £ 37.5m as a one - off payment to the @entity40 to preserve their unique identity			0
‘ the idea was to put @entity0 back on the map of @entity16 football and @entity47 football as soon as possible , ’ says vice-president , @entity42			2
‘ i think we did that			0
i think people recognise that we ’re good as we attract attention to the @entity16 league			0
’ @entity0 ’s win at @entity54 on friday leaves them in fourth place			0
‘ our ambition is to win the title in the next few years and stay in the top three and be an important actor of the @entity47 stage , ’ said @entity42			1
‘ we ca n’t be in the top 10 but we can be an important player			0
’ @entity9 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) flank @entity42 on their visit to @entity0			2

@entity0 finished second to @entity17 last season but let *talents* such as @entity6 and @entity5 depart
the club spent £ 140m in 2013 following *relegation* and vice-president @entity42 is thinking *big*
' our ambition is to win the title in the next few years and stay in the top three and be an important actor of the @entity47 stage , ' said @entity42
