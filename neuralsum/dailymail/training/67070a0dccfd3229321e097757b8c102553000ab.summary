by @entity1 reporter published : 23:06 est , 19 march 2014 updated : 23:06 est , 19 march 2014 the @entity3 must offer a federal judge a better explanation as to why it is refusing to give information to a graduate student researching an alleged plot to kill ' occupy ' leaders in @entity11 , the judge hearing the case ruled last week			1
judge @entity14 of the @entity15 wrote in her ruling that the reason the @entity3 gave for denying @entity20 graduate student @entity19 access to key pieces of information in heavily redacted documents was not sufficient , and a better explanation must be provided if the @entity3 continues to refuse to share the information			1
@entity19 is researching an alleged sniper plot to kill leaders of a @entity29 - based spin - off of the ' occupy ' movement			0
he sued the @entity3 after submitting a @entity32 request with the @entity3 and getting back the heavily redacted documents			0
@entity33 : @entity34 says the @entity3 is violating the @entity32 by withholding certain information he requested the @entity3 claims the information @entity19 is asking for is exempt under @entity33			1
@entity19 disagrees , and feels the @entity3 is violating @entity33 regulations			2
the plot to kill ' occupy ' leaders first was discovered in documents released to a civil rights organization in @entity42 as part of a separate @entity33 request			1
the documents released by the @entity3 referenced a ' plan to kill the leadership via suppressed sniper rifles			2
it 's unclear who was behind this alleged plot , and whether it was ever investigated by the @entity3			1
the @entity3 is granted certain leeway under @entity33 - it is allowed to withhold ' information compiled for law enforcement purposes ' if disclosing it would interfere with ongoing investigations or endanger lives			2
not impressed : judge @entity14 says the @entity3 needs to provide more information about why it is refusing to hand over the information according to the @entity62 , the exemption ' was repeatedly cited by @entity33 chief @entity63 in a filing to the court in support of an @entity3 motion to dismiss mr. @entity19 ’s lawsuit			1
some information was redacted , according to mr. @entity63 ’s filing , because it involved information shared with local law enforcement agencies related to an investigation of “ potential criminal activity by protestors involved with the @entity76 in @entity29			0
' ” possible crimes cited by @entity63 include ' domestic terrorism ' and ' advocating overthrow of the government			0
' that vague explanation was not enough for @entity82			0
occupy : the information is in regard to an alleged plot to assassinate leaders of an occupy movement in @entity29 ' at no point does mr. @entity63 supply specific facts as to the basis for @entity3 ’s belief that the occupy protestors might have been engaged in terroristic or other criminal activity , ' she wrote in her ruling			1
' neither the word ‘ terrorism ’ nor the phrase " advocating the overthrow of the government " are talismanic , especially where @entity3 purports to be investigating individuals who ostensibly are engaged in protected @entity104 activity			0
' judge @entity14 has given the @entity3 until april 9 to provide a more satisfactory explanation of its withholding of the information by april 9			0
@entity14 is allowing the agency to file its response under seal .			0
