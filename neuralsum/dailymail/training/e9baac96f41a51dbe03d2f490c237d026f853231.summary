by @entity0 it seems there ’s been a bit of a kerfuffle recently about my half a million pound bar bill , so perhaps i should set the record straight			1
several newspapers and websites ran a story yesterday saying that i spent £ 488,706.08 on a night out clubbing			2
not true , but it is fair to say that the rather stiff bar tab did come as a bit of a shock			1
i was out at @entity16 ’s in @entity17 on saturday night and was having a good time as always			2
the @entity20 downstairs was full with their usual well - heeled and beautiful clientele , and the drinks were reassuringly expensive and well made			1
revealed : @entity0 explains the true story behind that bar bill and reveals what each of his co-stars will be getting for @entity28 the female bartender was particularly attractive and we chatted as i ordered two @entity32 sodas with fresh lime , and two shots of @entity35			1
however on this occasion , trying to charm the barmaid was my downfall			1
she was distracted as she keyed in the bill and what should have been £ 48 ended up as £ 488,706.08			2
what a charmer : trying to charm the barmaid was @entity44 's downfall			1
she was distracted as she keyed in the bill and what should have been £ 48 ended up as £ 488,706.08 , oops ! my heart skipped a beat or two and i was concerned that prices had gone up a bit since i 'd last been at the club only a few days before , but it did n’t take @entity52 to work out the mystery of the six - figure bill			2
it was resolved very quickly and we had a good laugh about it , but then i made a schoolboy error of judgement – i tweeted the bill			2
it was meant to be a joke			0
surely no one could seriously think i would drop £ 500k on a round of drinks			0
i woke up the next day to over 3,000 retweets , and several people berating me for such an outrageously extravagant waste of money and that i should have donated the money to the @entity72 @entity71 campaign instead of a boozy night out			0
well for once i wholeheartedly agree with my twitter critics			0
@entity75 has left more than 4,000 dead and half a million people without homes			0
the @entity71 campaign is certainly a worthy cause and i am happy to match my night ’s drinks bill pound for pound ( the real one ) , and i would ask you to do the same and you can make your donations here			0
with what money i have left over from saturday ’s night out i ’ve started to think about @entity28 and i ’m looking to buy gifts for all of my made in @entity86 chums			1
i ’m doing most of my shopping online this year , and hopefully this will help get back in their good books … @entity0 is really into her beauty as readers of her @entity95 online blog will know well , and this @entity97 – ticks two of her favourite boxes , perfume and glitter			1
@entity97 it ’s glittery shimmer powder for hair and skin and the black cherry and rose scent is divine			0
perfect for party season ( £ 45.90 @ escentual.com )			0
is it inappropriate to buy lingerie for an ex-girlfriend ? i hope not			2
i ’m thinking of this rather beautiful @entity114 outfit for @entity115			1
the @entity116 looks sexy and classy and a woman can never have enough lingerie			2
( £ 43 at @entity121 ) , and also this @entity120 basque is gorgeous as well ( £ 38 @ bluebella.com )			0
@entity122 : @entity0 is planning on buying @entity123 these kinky handcuffs ( r ) saucy : is it inappropriate to buy lingerie for an ex-girlfriend ? i hope not			1
i 'm thinking of this rather beautiful @entity114 outfit for @entity115 jewellery is a big part of @entity0 ’s life and she even has her own dreamy range out , so i need to come up with something rather clever – and this @entity135 is jewellery with fragrance all in one – is a double whammy			1
its charm resembles a golden butterfly with black striped wings , which twists open to reveal the honey solid perfume			0
it smells as delightful as it looks ( £ 28.90 at @entity144 )			0
yet again last night @entity145 was channeling a @entity147 coiffure , so perhaps he will benefit from this @entity148			0
and it ’s a snip at £ 7.95 at @entity150 @entity151 is one the nicest guys i know but he needs a bit of a re-brand for the party season to get him to snare the right girl			0
so he ’s getting the @entity157 ( £ 38 at @entity144 ) fashion faux pas : i need to @entity159 a a new shooting jacket - i would advise this classic waxed @entity162 @entity161 , says on - trend @entity0 @entity159 made a slightly unusual choice of attire at our day out shooting clays on last night ’s @entity0 show so i think i need to buy him a new shooting jacket – i would advise this classic waxed @entity162 @entity161 ( £ 299 at @entity169 )			1
finally i ’m giving @entity0 some @entity171 handcuffs ( £ 14.99 @ @entity172 )			1
and if she behaves herself in 2014 , i ’ll send her the key as well			0
happy @entity28 shopping , all the best , @entity175			1

says the bar tab price was a mistake by barmaid
shares his @entity28 list for @entity0 cast - and @entity115 and @entity184 are getting lingerie and handcuffs
