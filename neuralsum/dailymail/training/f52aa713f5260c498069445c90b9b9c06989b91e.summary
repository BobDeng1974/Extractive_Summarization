by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the @entity3 says the rate of earthquakes in @entity6 has increased by about 50 % since october 2013 , significantly increasing the chance for a damaging quake in central @entity6			1
in a statement by the @entity3 and @entity11 , the agencies reported that 183 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater occurred from october 2013 through april 14			0
this compares with an average of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger earthquakes per year from 1978 to 2008			0
a senior adviser from the @entity3 says he hopes the new advisory will become a crucial consideration in earthquake preparedness for residents , schools and businesses in the central @entity6 area			1
warning : @entity26 residents are being told to brace for an earthquake			0
this map shows all @entity6 earthquakes magnitude - 3 and greater since 1978 the @entity3 says the number of earthquakes in @entity6 has gone up dramatically			1
it says the surge in seismic activity is due in part to and that it has increased the danger of a damaging quake in the central part of the state aftermath : an @entity6 resident cleans up his in - laws house following the state 's last major earthquake in november 2011 @entity6 was hit by two earthquakes in less than 24 hours on november 6 , 2011			1
geologists are predicting another to hit the statement indicates that a likely factor in the increase in earthquakes is wastewater injection used for fracking			2
' we have n't seen this before in @entity6 , so we had some concerns about putting a specific number on the chances of it , ' @entity52 , a research geophysicist with the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , told @entity62			0
' but we know from other cases around the world that if you have an increasing number of small earthquakes , the chances of a larger one will go up			0
' that 's why earthquakes of magnitude 5 and larger are more frequent in states such as @entity73 and @entity74 , where thousands of smaller temblors hit every year			1
this is the first time the @entity3 has issued an earthquake warning for a state east of the @entity79 , @entity52 said			2
such seismic hazard assessments are more typically issued for @entity82 states following large quakes , to warn residents of the risk of damaging aftershocks , he said			0
the @entity3 and @entity11 , citing a dramatic spike in magnitude 3.0 temblors , especially since october 2013 183 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater occurred in @entity6 from october 2013 through april 14 , 2014			1
this compares with a long - term average from 1978 to 2008 of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger earthquakes per year maintenance workers inspect the damage to one of the spires on @entity99 at @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity6 on sunday , nov. 6 , 2011			2
two earthquakes in the area in less than 24 hours caused one of the towers to topple the geological agencies took action after the rate of earthquakes in @entity6 outpaced that of even @entity73 for the first few months of 2014			1
' the rate of earthquakes increased dramatically in march and april , ' @entity52 said			0
' that alerted us to examine this further and put out this advisory statement			0
' while @entity6 's buildings can withstand light earthquakes , the damage from a magnitude - 5 temblor could be widespread			2
@entity6 's last major earthquake was in november 2011 , when a magnitude - 5.6 earthquake centered near @entity121 , @entity6 , destroyed 14 homes and injured at least two people			2
' building owners and government officials should have a special concern for older , unreinforced brick structures , which are vulnerable to serious damage during sufficient shaking , ' @entity124 , a @entity3 senior science adviser for earthquakes and geologic hazards , said in the joint statement			0
the result of the increased number of small and moderate shocks is the likelihood of future damaging for central and north - central @entity6 , geologists say			1

major increase in seismic shaking led to a rare earthquake warning on may 5 from the @entity3
risk of damaging earthquake larger than magnitude *5.0* has significantly increased in central @entity6
geologists ca n't determine when it will strike
@entity150 of magnitude 5 and larger more frequent in @entity73 and @entity74
@entity6 outpaced that of even @entity73 for the first few months of 2014 in the rate of earthquakes
water injection used in fracking could be *blamed* for increasing *underground* pressures
