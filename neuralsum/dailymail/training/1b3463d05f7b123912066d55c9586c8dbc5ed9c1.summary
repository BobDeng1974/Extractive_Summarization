plans : @entity1 , @entity2 , believes a new ' right - to - own ' scheme would attract more ' @entity5 voters ' from the skilled working classes , providing a timely election boost millions of working families would be given the chance to own their own homes in radical conservative plans to extend @entity13 ’s flagship housing policy			1
the right - to - buy would be extended to up to 2.5million housing association tenants – transforming the lives of many			0
some could even be rewarded for holding down a job for a year or more by simply being handed a stake in their properties			1
work and pensions secretary @entity1 is understood to be pushing both ideas – designed to echo @entity13 ’s defining right - to - buy policy for council house tenants – for inclusion in the @entity25 election manifesto			1
a senior @entity28 source said this was being ‘ seriously considered ’			0
introduced in 1980 , the right - to - buy led to more than 1.5million homes being sold off at discounted rates			1
mr @entity1 believes that a new ‘ right - to - own ’ would attract more ‘ @entity5 voters ’ – the skilled working classes who helped to deliver @entity13 ’s three election victories			1
as well as promoting home ownership and rewarding work , he argues that the scheme would reduce the vast housing benefit bill			1
currently , taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower - paid workers who live in housing association properties			0
housing associations are non-profit making private bodies that provide low - cost social housing			0
regulated by the state , they receive public funding			0
right - to - buy rules allow most council tenants to buy their homes at a discount , but the rules do not apply to housing associations			1
they only qualify for limited discounts and can only buy a property that has been acquired by an association since 1997			1
discounts vary between areas , but range from £ 9,000 to £ 16,000			0
council house tenants , by contrast , can get discounts of up to £ 77,000 across @entity67 and £ 102,700 in @entity68			0
the @entity69 , the think tank set up by mr @entity1 in opposition , has suggested housing association tenants should be offered discounts of up to 30 per cent of a property ’s value			1
former @entity25 leadership contender @entity75 and former @entity77 welfare minister @entity76 have also backed new rights for tenants to buy their homes			1
still more radical would be rewarding those with the best employment records with free stakes in their homes			2
mr @entity1 is understood to want to consider the idea for those in work for a year or more			1
the association would retain a 40 per cent stake , ensuring taxpayers gain from an increase in house prices , while the owners would have the remaining 60 per cent			2
money raised when the property was sold would be ploughed back into more social housebuilding , which would be spread out rather than concentrated on estates			2
@entity97 policy : former prime minister @entity13 introduced the ' right - to - buy ' scheme in 1980 , which led to more than 1.5million homes being sold off at discounted rates the move is being supported by the @entity25 ’ election campaign chief @entity102 , according to @entity28 sources			2
some in @entity106 are said to be cautious about mr @entity1 ’s proposals			1
there are fears that handing people in social housing a stake in their homes might anger voters renting in the private sector , with little hope of affording to buy			1
however , the government has already launched its help to buy scheme , which offers first - time buyers support in getting on to the property ladder			2
@entity122 , chief executive of @entity123 , said : ‘ it would be important to ensure that housing associations were able to replenish housing stock			0
’ a @entity25 spokesman said : ‘ we will set out our manifesto policies at the appropriate time			0
no decisions have been taken			0
’ enabling housing association tenants to buy their homes would be likely to require major changes to the @entity133 so that associations are forced to sell at the discounts set by government			2
the @entity137 has already increased right - to - buy discounts for council homes , meaning more are moving into the private sector			2
but housing associations , which date back to the 19th century , have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing			0
they are autonomous , not - for - profit bodies backed by public money and loans from the private sector			0
@entity150 of the @entity151 , which represents @entity153 ’s non-profit housing associations , said : ‘ we fully support the aspiration of homeownership , but not at the expense of the 1.7million people currently waiting for desperately needed social housing			0
‘ selling off homes at a price that leaves very little to replace them does not make sense			0
’ he said the suggestion that housing association tenants might own their homes after a year of work was ‘ so preposterous , it can not be considered a serious solution to our housing crisis ’ .			1

conservatives plan to give working families chance to own their homes
some could be rewarded for staying in work with a stake in their property
