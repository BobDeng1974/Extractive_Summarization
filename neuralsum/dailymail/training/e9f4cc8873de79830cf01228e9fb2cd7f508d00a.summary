it is the one glaring omission from an otherwise incomparable medal haul but @entity2 is being backed to complete the set at last			1
no less a judge than @entity5 has studied his countryman ’s state of mind in the build - up to @entity9 2014			1
he is convinced the @entity11 captain is about to add @entity13 winner to the countless accolades he has gathered down the years with @entity15			1
as a veteran of 145 international appearances and two @entity18 , @entity5 knows better than most how expectation tends to get the better of @entity11 on football ’s biggest stage — with attempts to add to their @entity13 triumphs of 1978 and 1986 ending in failure			1
a perception that he underachieves for @entity11 has always been held against him but @entity5 , who brought the curtain down on a glittering career at the end of @entity40 ’s latest @entity42 campaign at the age of 40 , begs to differ			1
@entity5 said : ‘ for me , @entity2 is the best in the world , for club and country			1
there is no - one to touch him			2
he has already demonstrated that and he does n’t need a @entity13 winner ’s medal to prove it			1
he has won everything with @entity15 and been named @entity53 winner repeatedly			1
what he does on a football pitch is amazing			2
‘ no - one should be too surprised if he has dominated for @entity15 more than he has for @entity11			1
when you are with the same players every day you develop a telepathic understanding			0
it ’s not so easy when you report every few months and find yourself with players you are not used to playing with			0
@entity61 : @entity5 continued playing for @entity62 club @entity40 until he was 40 - years - old history repeated : @entity11 captain @entity64 holds aloft the trophy after winning the 1978 @entity13 waiting game : @entity67 inspired @entity11 to their last @entity13 win in @entity69 1986 ‘ a lot of top players find it more difficult when they turn out for their country but the signs are that we will see the best of @entity2 in @entity9			1
he was exceptional in the qualifying campaign			0
the captaincy seems to be bringing something extra out of him			0
he has terrific strength of character and has been showing real leadership			0
‘ he has proved himself captain in the best possible way by inspiring all around him and leading by example , and that is going to stand us in good stead			0
‘ i can see him having an outstanding @entity13			1
this stage is made for him			0
i really do think this could be our time and we will see @entity2 lifting the trophy			1
’ if he does , it will have been a long wait for a nation with such an embarrassment of riches , particularly in attack			2
@entity5 ca n’t come up with a reason but is adamant it has nothing to do with any clash of egos			2
@entity103 's best ! @entity2 has won a record four coveted @entity105 awards while playing for @entity15 same wavelength : @entity2 has dominated for @entity15 because of a telepathic understanding with stars when it was put to him , through an interpreter , he shook his head and said : ‘ we have always had a terrific group of players from the point of view of unity and wanting the best for our country			1
@entity120 has never been an issue in all my years with @entity11			2
‘ you can look for reasons why we have not always done as well as we should but you can never question our desire or togetherness			0
it is an absolute privilege , pleasure and honour to be picked to represent @entity11 and everyone feels the same sense of pride when they pull on the jersey			2
. ' it is not an easy tournament to win , the @entity13			2
you need a bit of luck and maybe that has n’t always gone our way			0
‘ for instance , @entity139 was far and away the best coach i played for			0
his tactical awareness , preparation , man management , everything was spot on			0
yet with him in charge we did n’t make it out of the group in 2002			0
‘ people always say we are one of the favourites , but that is the paradox			0
’ warm up : @entity2 ( c ) vies for the ball during a friendly against @entity155 ahead of the @entity13 reversal of fortune : @entity2 has been outstanding during @entity13 qualification , despite having a relatively quiet season for @entity15 no guarantees : @entity5 rates @entity160 as @entity11 's best manager - yet they failed to get out of the group stages at the 2002 @entity13 if the @entity13 becomes the main focus of attention in @entity166 for the duration of the finals , @entity5 insists it is nothing compared to his homeland			1
‘ every time it comes round , the whole of @entity11 grinds to a standstill , ’ he said			2
‘ if you think there is a burden of expectation on the @entity166 players ’ shoulders , you should see what it is like for our boys			0
‘ it does n’t matter what has gone before , there is an expectation , almost a demand , that we win it			0
passion : @entity11 supporters crowd around the team bus as it takes players to the airport in @entity195 dynamic duo : @entity197 ( r ) and @entity2 pose for a selfie on their way to @entity9 say cheese : @entity2 ( @entity202 ) joins his @entity11 teammates for a group selfie on the plane to @entity9 ‘ football is an integral part of everyday life in @entity11			1
it is incredibly intense and you feel you have let people down when you come home without the trophy			0
‘ but we can do it this time			0
most people back home expect a front three of @entity2 , @entity218 and @entity197			1
what an attacking force that is but , for me , it would be just as potent if it was @entity222 and @entity223 alongside @entity2			1
‘ it is about getting the balance right , and i firmly believe we have players who can be counted on to contribute all over the pitch			0

@entity5 claims @entity2 will lift the @entity13 in @entity9
@entity2 has *n't* always performed as well for @entity11 as he has @entity15
@entity11 are desperate to repeat their @entity13 success of 1978 , 1986
@entity5 insists @entity2 is the best in the world for club and country
@entity2 will be joined by @entity197 and @entity218 in potent attack
