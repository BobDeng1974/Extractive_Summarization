by @entity0 a @entity3 man 's thong made entirely of loom bands is is back on sale on @entity6 after it was taken down by the online auction site for the advertisement being too racy			1
@entity9 , from @entity10 outside @entity11 , created the underwear or swimwear with his own hands out of loom bands			2
but when the 22 - year - old listed the item for sale on @entity6 , modelling the garment himself , is was deemed to have breached the site 's nudity laws			2
' so here 's my invention of the loom - kini ! ' he posts on his ad			0
' was tricky but i got there			0
please appreciate the time and effort i made to do this ! get bidding everyone ! ' unfortunately for @entity9 , he 's yet to receive a bid for the item which has a starting price of £ 30 - the auction closes on friday at 3.24pm			1
it 's sale at that price would yield a £ 24 profit on the colourful rubber bands he used to create it but not factoring in what he says was 24 hours in labour			1
the price is modest considering the recent £ 170,000 sale of a girl 's dress made of loom bands			1
@entity67 , from @entity68 , put the dress made by her friend @entity70 on @entity6 - modelled by her 12 - year - old daughter @entity71 - and it attracted 137 bids from around the world			0
its starting price was £ 50 before it skyrocketed			0
' it ’s definitely a bedroom kind of piece , i think , ' he told the @entity80			0
' but if someone was so inclined , i ’m sure they could wear it in public			0
' sold ! @entity86 models the dress made from 24,000 loom bands which sold last night on @entity6 for £ 170,000 final bid ! the auction ended at 5.13pm yesterday and a total of 137 people put their hat in the ring shocked : @entity67 , 42 , put the dress , made entirely from loom bands by her friend @entity97 , on @entity6			1
