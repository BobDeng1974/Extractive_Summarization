@entity1 's chances of hosting @entity4 ’s @entity3 quarter - final against @entity5 appear to be on rise following initial talks with the @entity8			1
although @entity12 immediately expressed a desire to play the july tie on a grass court , the fact that neither @entity10 nor the @entity11 will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the @entity18			1
@entity12 celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over @entity20 on sunday @entity4 supporters would relish supporting @entity22 in @entity1 again in july all three day 's of @entity3 action at the @entity18 were sold out in a matter of minutes the only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in @entity27 - but neither the players nor captain @entity29 are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere			1
the noise and passion of the @entity36 crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the @entity39 , sparking a debate within the @entity8 over whether that x factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass			2
while @entity12 prefers it to the indoor hard court , he would be favourite to beat any of his @entity5 opponents on any surface – while @entity50 no 2 @entity49 is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface , potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made			2
@entity55 captain @entity29 doubts the chances of @entity1 being able to create a larger grass - court venue @entity29 embraces with @entity12 after the latter 's straight sets win secured @entity55 's quarter - final berth @entity12 ( middle ) is looked on in envy by his fellow @entity55 team - mates after securing a tie against @entity5 @entity66 understands that the city authorities are willing to leave the july 17 - 19 dates clear in the hope of getting the nod over the coming week or so			1
unfortunately , because it takes about a week to set up the court , a @entity72 concert would rule out taking the quarter - final to @entity76 , the city ’s biggest indoor venue			0
but a return to the @entity80 , which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days , is very much on the cards			0
although no one from @entity85 would comment on their plans yesterday , a spokesman said : ‘ the atmosphere at the weekend was electric and @entity1 proved , once again , why we are one of the world ’s top sporting cities			0
any decision on hosting future @entity3 ties would be for the @entity8			0

@entity4 face @entity5 in the @entity3 quarter finals in july
this tie could be held in @entity1 if @entity55 decide atmosphere outweighs the desire to play on a grass court
@entity12 admits his *preference* is grass , but that playing in @entity1 again with the crowd behind them could be *crucial*
