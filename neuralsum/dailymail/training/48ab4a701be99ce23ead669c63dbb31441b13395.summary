the treatment , which comes in a cream or handy deodorant - style stick , also includes beta glucan , a naturally occurring plant or yeast extract which has a proven protective and hydrating effect on wounds , and powerful @entity45 uv filters to shield against sun damage			1
in clinical trials , users who applied it twice a day said they noticed a 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks in only 28 days			1
patients with both existing and new scars , caused by minor surgery , burns , acne or accidents , who used the treatment , also reported a reduction in the length and height of their scarring			1
