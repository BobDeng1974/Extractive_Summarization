by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd just as it looked like @entity4 's luck was turning , disaster struck			0
' @entity5 ' brilliantly created @entity7 's opener against @entity8 but minutes later he was leaving the field with a limp			1
and it looked as if things were to get worse for @entity13 when @entity14 equalised in the second half for the recently relegated @entity19 side - before @entity18 's penalty 10 minutes from time gave the @entity21 their first win of their @entity24 pre season tour			1
@entity4 made a blistering start to his @entity13 career last season before fading away at the end of the campaign - and while fans will have been delighted to see him play a brilliant eye - of - the - needle assist for @entity7 to score , his early exit could be a worry with less than a month until the start of the season			2
summer signings @entity78 and @entity93 both made their second appearances of the summer as half time substitutes on a night when @entity13 's stars who did not travel to the @entity97 enjoyed a run out			2
@entity8 engineered the first real opening after 19 minutes when @entity51 threaded a pass through to @entity56 in the box but the striker 's left - footed strike from a tight angle was repelled by goalkeeper @entity62			0
@entity13 were not so forgiving in the final third and @entity83 's side went ahead after 25 minutes			1
@entity4 found @entity7 in the box and the midfielder kept his calm amid shouts for offside to cooly roll the ball pass @entity42 from close range			0
power : @entity114 converts the penalty with 10 minutes left to give @entity13 the win at @entity8 captain @entity18 : the @entity117 left back converted from the spot to give @entity13 their first pre season win touch of class : @entity4 watches on as his through ball is converted by @entity7 back on form : @entity7 had earlier given @entity13 the lead after a brilliant through ball from @entity4 with the exception of the goal scorer , @entity13 named a completely different line - up after the break			1
and @entity8 levelled after 56 minutes when @entity14 raced on to @entity56 's pass before calmly lifting the ball past @entity93			0
@entity13 were awarded a penalty with ten minutes left when @entity44 brought down @entity79 after taking a bad first touch			0
@entity18 - roundly booed after criticising @entity44 for a challenge on keeper @entity72 - silenced the home crowd with a clinical low finish			0
worry : @entity83 will be hoping that @entity4 's injury is not serious ahead of the new season @entity140 lived : @entity8 trialist @entity14 celebrates his second half leveller			1

' @entity5 ' set up @entity7 to give @entity13 a half time lead at @entity41
@entity146 striker was seen limping towards the end of the first period
but @entity8 drew level with a well - worked goal from @entity14
@entity18 *buried* a penalty with 10 minutes to go to give @entity13 the win
@entity83 's side play @entity157 in the @entity158 next
