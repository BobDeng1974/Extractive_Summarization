by @entity0 last updated at 10:13 am on 25th november 2011 @entity1 has revealed that he still loves @entity2 and still hopes they could get back together			1
the @entity5 star and the pop singer split up last month after four years together as the strain of barely seeing each other took its toll			1
it is understood that @entity1 's failure to commit to starting a family further undermined their relationship and forced them apart			1
still in love : @entity1 flew to @entity16 to attempt a reconciliation with @entity19 born beauty @entity2 the break - up resulted in @entity1 adopting a negative attitude and , combined with poor results and incidents on the track , the 26 - year - old has cut a forlorn figure for a number of weeks			1
that appeared to be underlined this week when pictures were published of what looked like a frosty reunion in a @entity16 car park between him and @entity35 x-factor judge @entity2			1
but as he prepared for this sunday 's final race of the @entity5 season , the @entity39 @entity38 , in @entity37 , he said that could not be further from the truth			1
sporting a long black set of rosary beads overlaid with white gold given to him by his ex as a present in @entity16 , @entity1 said of the photographs : ' well , they did n't catch us at the best of times			2
' what you did n't see is that we had a really good week , a couple of really nice lunches together			2
we had a really nice dinner together			2
' it 's very early days and we still have very strong feelings for one another			2
i still love her very much			0
' amicable ' : the pair announced their split last month but @entity1 who has ' fond memories ' hopes for a reconciliation ' so , who knows ? maybe we will be together in the future			1
' @entity1 's trip to the @entity35 also included a visit to @entity75 in which he ' got to hang with @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 in the studio , which was really cool '			0
@entity1 could now not be more upbeat ahead of the weekend , saying : ' i 'm very much here in a positive frame of mind			0
' i am very happy to be here , i 've great memories of being here in the past			0
' actually she ( @entity2 ) was here with me when i won the world championship ( in 2008 ) , so i 've very good memories			0
' but certainly it was a really positive few days which meant more to me than a race win , so i came away from @entity16 feeling great and things are different , so that 's cool			0
' i 've a lot of positive energy at the moment			0
' hopeful : @entity1 is keen to give the relationship another go			0
