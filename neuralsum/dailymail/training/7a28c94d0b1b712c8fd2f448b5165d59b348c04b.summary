by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has promised @entity3 will not cash in on @entity4 this summer even if he returns from the @entity5 as a superstar			1
there is a buzz of anticipation around @entity4 following his excellent debut season in the @entity11 and the clamour is growing for @entity13 to be bold and make him part of his starting line - up in @entity16			1
@entity2 has no doubts the midfielder belongs on the biggest stage and expects him to seize the moment if @entity13 unleashes him when @entity21 begins with a game against @entity23 in @entity24 next month , insisting he has the ability to “ impress millions ”			1
‘ it would be wrong for him ( to leave this summer ) , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ i always feel as manager you develop a relationship with players and you ’re always honest with that			0
@entity4 is a phenomenal talent , probably the best @entity51 talent i have ever seen , but he is not the finished article yet			2
‘ it ’s our duty to protect him and i know @entity3 is the perfect place for him for the next 12 months			0
we need to come along and try to get into the top four positions to offer players like @entity4 the next stage of their development			2
‘ but @entity4 is delighted at @entity3 and feels very much in the right place at the right time of his career			1
’ new boy : @entity4 made his debut in a @entity5 qualifying win against @entity67 in 2013 on target : @entity4 scored six @entity11 goals for @entity3 in his first season in the team one of @entity4 ’s biggest attributes is his ability of not allowing big occasions to affect him and @entity2 expects his reputation to be dramatically enhanced if things turn out the way @entity3 ’s manager envisages			1
‘ he ’s playing at a @entity5 and he could be in a position to impress millions never mind just the people in @entity28 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ that ’s the type of tournament we are talking of			0
but @entity4 will never look at it in that way , he will look at it and try to be as good as he can to help @entity28			0
‘ @entity4 will come back the same person i can guarantee you that			2
he ’s not someone who will lose sight of realism when he comes back			0
for us he ’s a star whatever happens in the @entity5			0
he is ready now to fulfil whatever role the @entity28 manager wants to give him			0
’ pressure : there is a clamour for @entity28 manager @entity13 to include @entity4 in his team			0

@entity4 *'s* development must continue at @entity3 , says @entity2
it would be wrong to consider *selling* him this summer
labelled as ' best young talent ' the @entity3 manager has worked with
@entity2 *believes* @entity4 has the talent to *wow* millions at the @entity5
but *teenage* midfielder will return from @entity16 the same person
