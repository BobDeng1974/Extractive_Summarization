they may not be much to look at - but these scraps of land and tumbledown shacks could prove a bargain for buyers in @entity6			1
the city government is selling some 1,700 vacant lots and ruined properties which have gone unclaimed for years - many since the devastation wrought by @entity11 in 2005			1
tens of thousands fled the city , never to return , in the wake of the devastating storm , leaving many homes to crumble into ruin , and patches of land to grow wild			2
past its best : this property , 1904 @entity23 , is one of the homes for sale			0
the vast majority of the lots are empty plots typical : more than 1,000 empty spaces like these will be sold - after the city has given up any realistic hope of finding previous owners			1
pictured is 838 @entity36 and after years of taxes and charges on the land piling up , city authorities have decided to cut their losses by putting them all up for auction			1
there is no minimum bid , but every property comes with at least $ 3,000 of fees - meaning nothing will go for less than that			1
the properties were only put forward after city tax collectors tried to find the rightful owners and failed , the @entity50 reported			0
many have so many charges stacked up that paying them off would cost more than the plot is worth			0
nonetheless , anybody interested must put down a $ 650 deposit , to cover the cost of trying again to track down the owners and giving them one last chance to square their debts			1
anomaly ? apartment # 10 inside this building , 627 @entity67 in the @entity68 , is also listed for auction , despite its much smarter appearance than most lots for sale			1
however , there is no word on what it is like inside tempting : this patch overgrown weeds - also known as @entity79 - is one of the almost 1,800 lots for sale some of the lots are empty patches of ground , others are overgrown with weeds or piled with trash			2
many are barely a mile from the historic @entity68 , and not far from parks or the shores of @entity92			0
one property , on the city 's @entity67 , appears to be within a still - standing and well - appointed apartment building - but there was no word on its condition inside			2
other complete properties , largely wooden shacks , are so dilapidated they can hardly stay upright			0
they are being listed online by @entity102 , a company holding the auction on the city 's behalf			0
buyers are being encouraged to cross-references the addresses with online street view services to get a look at what they are bidding on			0
empty : the unused land around this university building is another one of the lots - listed under 131 @entity115 all - natural : 1925 @entity117 is another of the chunks of land which has gone unclaimed and unmaintained trash - heap : 3039 pauger street was another of the vacant lots up for sale in the huge auction city authorities have also said that all the sales are conditional on the auctioneers being able to get title insurance for the homes			1
however , unlike similar schemes in other cities , there is no provision that owners have to develop or repairs the plots - or even live there			0
this has raised fears that professional investors and would - be landlords will take advantage of the low prices to turn large profits after improving the properties , especially as prices and the reputation of @entity6 as a city recover			2
however , the prospect seems not to worry the administration of mayor @entity151 , which could earn millions of dollars from the sale .			0

@entity6 city authorities are *organizing* huge auction of vacant homes
*mixture* of tumbledown shacks , empty lots - and at least one apartment
buyers have to contribute $ 650 deposit and $ 3,000 in *transaction* fees
but there is no minimum price at the auction itself
all homes have been unclaimed for at least 5 years and have huge tax bills
@entity175 will wipe debts for new buyers - and use sale price to swell *coffers*
