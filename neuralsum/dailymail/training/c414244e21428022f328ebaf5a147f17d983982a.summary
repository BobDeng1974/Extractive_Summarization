@entity0 were left feeling red - faced on wednesday night after not only falling to a humiliating defeat at the hands of @entity3 , but also hyping themselves up in pre-game banter between them and their @entity8 opponents on social media			1
the @entity10 face an uphill battle to qualify for the last eight of the @entity13 after a heavy 3 - 1 defeat at the @entity15 , but prior to the game they were certainly confident - with the club 's social media team expressing that in abundance on their official @entity21 account			2
they began the exchange simply with : ' and how about you @ @entity24 ? feeling confident ? nervous ? worried ? ' @entity0 and @entity3 engaged in @entity21 banter on their respective accounts prior to wednesday night 's game @entity28 had scored in his last four @entity13 games at the @entity15 prior to facing @entity3 the @entity31 side responded candidly by merely stating they were ' just feeling excited to play in such a big match ' , before the @entity10 upped the ante by asking which player they should look out for - with star name @entity36 now on @entity38 's books			1
the @entity8 team then asked if @entity40 would fit the bill , adding that the @entity10 fans were very complementary of him during his time at north @entity45 rivals @entity44			0
while admitting they knew all too well of the veteran striker 's talents , the north @entity46 quashed his impact by stating former striker @entity50 made the difference that day when @entity40 hit the net for @entity44 in a derby meeting in december 2007			0
former @entity44 man @entity40 enjoyed his second - half strike which put the game beyond @entity0 @entity56 and @entity57 can not fail to hide their gloom after @entity40 's crucial goal @entity61 endured a night to forget against his former side @entity3 at the @entity15 the next reply from @entity0 would come back to haunt them as they sent the @entity8 side a graphic of star striker @entity28 , with the stat that he had scored in his last four @entity13 games at the @entity15 prior to wednesday night 's clash			1
the @entity8 side had the last word though , and in superb fashion , thanking @entity0 for their warning but reminding @entity61 's men that they had - and still do have - the best defensive record in the @entity13 - conceding just once in the group stages			2
a number of @entity0 fans asked for the club to stop engaging in the @entity21 banter throughout the exchanges , believing it could jinx their chances before the game even started			0
unfortunately for them they were proved right , as the @entity10 suffered a heavy defeat with @entity89 having the last laugh .			0

@entity0 lost 3 - 1 to @entity3 on wednesday night in their last - *16* @entity13 clash at the @entity15
the club engaged in *pre-match* banter with @entity3 prior to the game
however it came back to haunt them as they lost to the @entity8 side
