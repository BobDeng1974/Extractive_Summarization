a little girl has been cured of a rare a condition that made milk shoot out of her nose			1
@entity4 was born with birth defects that meant her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach			1
this meant that whenever her mother tried to feed her with a bottle , milk would come back out of her nose and mouth			1
@entity4 was rushed to surgery to undergo an operation to connect the oesophagus to the trachea just 22 hours after she was born on july 10 2014			1
@entity4 , now eight months , was born with birth defects meaning whenever she was fed , milk shot back out of her nose and mouth			1
she is pictured with parents @entity21 , 25 and @entity23 @entity4 was born with the birth defects oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - meaning her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach @entity4 was rushed for an operation to correct the defects when she was just two days old			1
she has since had five more operations to further correct the problem and rid her of scar tissue @entity4 , aged eight months , is now out of hospital and finally able to enjoy life at home with parents @entity21 , 25 , and @entity23 , 19 , from @entity37 , @entity38			1
ms @entity21 , a travel agent , said : ' when @entity4 was born , i was rushed in for an emergency c - section , so i did n't get to hold her in the beginning			1
' when i finally tried to feed her that night , the milk was coming out of her nose and mouth and going everywhere - almost like when you drink a fizzy drink and it shoots out of your nose			1
' i thought it might have been me - and because i was trying to feed her on my own			0
' but when the midwife came around to help me , she realised something was wrong as the milk was going down the wrong tube and @entity4 's breathing was n't right			1
' she was taken away from me a few times in the night and taken into special care			0
it was n't until they x-rayed her that i was told what was wrong			0
' oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that affects the baby 's oesophagus , the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach			1
in oesophageal atresia , the upper part of the oesophagus does n't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach			1
it ends in a pouch , which means food can not reach the stomach			1
it often happens together with another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula , which is a connection between the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe ( trachea )			2
this causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach , and stomach acid to pass into the lungs			2
it 's not known why the defect develops , but it 's more likely to happen in babies of mothers who had too much amniotic fluid in pregnancy ( polyhydramnios )			0
the defect means the baby wo n't be able to swallow and digest food safely , or at all			1
oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula are thought to affect about one in 2,500 - 3,500 births			1
if they 're not corrected soon after birth , the pouch at the end of the oesophagus may fill with food and saliva , which can overflow into the baby 's windpipe			2
source : @entity113 doctors diagnosed @entity4 with oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - two conditions that tend to occur together			1
in oesophageal atresia , the upper part of the oesophagus does n't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach			1
it ends in a pouch , which means food can not reach the stomach			2
the condition often occurs alongside another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula			0
this is where the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe ( trachea ) are connected , rater than being separate			2
this causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach , and stomach acid to pass into the lungs			2
@entity4 was kept in surgery for five hours and spent six days in intensive care at the @entity143 , @entity144			2
ms @entity21 said : ' i was shocked to see her go straight into surgery , but i did n't really know what to think at first			0
' all i could think when i saw her lying there was that i wished it could have been me			0
' i could n't wait for the three of us to get home together , so it was n't a nice feeling to know that we could n't even put the banners up at home to welcome the baby			0
' since the initial surgery , @entity4 has had a further five operations to correct her tubes and scar tissue			1
she will have to undergo further operations , but is currently developing well			0
ms @entity21 said : ' we 've had major setbacks and she 's been so poorly but she 's such a bright and bubbly little thing			0
@entity4 is now at home enjoying time with her family			2
her mother said : ' we 've had major setbacks and she 's been so poorly but she 's such a bright and bubbly little @entity171 does everything a normal baby would do ' ' @entity4 is a lovely baby			2
she 's so bright and clever			0
she does everything a normal baby would do			0
' she loves peekaboo and is full of smiles			0
' @entity177 , consultant paediatric surgeon at the @entity143 , said : ' a tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormality with the oesophagus which develops incorrectly - essentially leading to two blind endings to the oesophagus , the lower ending of which stopping at the windpipe			0
' patients undergo surgery whereby the two ends are stitched together and usually do well after that			0
any additional medical conditions diagnosed are unrelated			0
' when baby 's first attempt at feeding is met with coughing and spluttering , nurses pass a tube down the nose and into the stomach and perform an x-ray			0
' if the tube gets stuck in the chest as opposed to reaching the stomach , a tracheoesophageal fistula is diagnosed			0
