a @entity2 teenager with cancer who took her fight to stop her chemotherapy treatments to the state 's @entity6 must remain in custody of the state even though her disease has gone into remission , a judge ruled on wednesday			1
superior court judge @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity2 , denied requests made last month by attorneys for both @entity16 and her mother , @entity17 , that the 17 - year - old be released from the temporary custody of the state @entity20 , or that her mother be permitted to visit her in the hospital			1
the judge ruled on wednesday she must remain in @entity20 custody until completing court - ordered chemotherapy for @entity29 's lymphoma , a type of blood cancer , at @entity32 in @entity33			1
the state @entity6 then ruled against @entity16 's claim that she was mature enough to make her own medical decisions			2
treatments were ordered for at least six months after doctors said the teen had an 85 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy , but faced a near certainty of death within two years without it			2
but after she was declared by doctors to be in remission in march , her lawyer @entity63 and attorneys for her mother appealed at a closed - door court hearing seeking permission to allow her to go home to complete treatments , or at least to permit her mother to visit her in the hospital			1

@entity29 ( cells pictured ) is a disease of the white blood cells @entity29 is cancer of the white blood cells called b lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body			2
the lymphatic system is part of your immune system			0
@entity94 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			0
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands			0
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			0
the most common symptom of @entity29 is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin			0
it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50			0
the cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system , taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the @entity126 ( which causes glandular fever )			0
it is n't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it			0
the only way to confirm a diagnosis of @entity29 is by carrying out a biopsy			0
almost all young people with @entity29 will be fully cured			0
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent			0
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids			1
' she has n't been able to see her mother for months , and now that she 's in remission we do n't think that 's in her best interests , ' said attorney @entity153 , representing @entity154			2
@entity20 commissioner @entity155 said in a statement wednesday her agency is ' looking forward to the day later this month when @entity16 can happily return home after her treatment is completed and the doctors are confident that she has beaten the cancer			1
' the case drew national attention when the teen rejected chemotherapy treatments after being diagnosed in september			2
both the teen and her mother said she did n't want to poison her body , and she ran away after two chemo treatments			2
@entity169 , an attorney for the teen 's mother , @entity17 , said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order , they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital			1
ms @entity176 said @entity20 has prohibited her from having contact with her mother			1
' we 'd like to end the whole thing , ' @entity12 said , according to the @entity180 , during a break in the hearing , ' but if we ca n't , we want to do as much as we can for her			0
she wants to be with her mother			2
' after ms @entity17 was diagnosed with high - risk @entity29 lymphoma in september , she and her mother missed several appointments , prompting doctors to notify the @entity20 , court documents say			1
a trial court in november granted @entity20 temporary custody of ms @entity17			1
lawyers for @entity16 and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed			1
the case went to the state @entity6 , which ruled in january that the state was n't violating ms @entity17 's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy			1
the case centered on the mature minor doctrine recognised by several other states â€” whether 16 - and 17 - year - olds are mature enough to make their own medical decisions			2
ms @entity17 told @entity204 that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit			1
she said the hospital even posted a guard outside her door because they feared that she would try to escape			2
on the day before her chemotherapy , hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic			1
a judge has ruled against the 17 - year - old girl who originally refused chemotherapy , and she will have to finish her treatments at the hospital instead of going home she said : ' when a nurse came in and i told myself just to fight			1
when she started to put an iv in me , i would n't let her			0
' ms @entity17 spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment			1
' @entity227 had to pick me up , pin me to the bed and strap me down by my wrists and ankles , when i woke up , i looked down and there was a port in my chest			0
i thought , ' i can not believe they did this to me			0
' ' i felt violated			0
i felt like i was being treated like an animal			1
i thought , ' how can you force a person , regardless of how old they are , to do something they have n't given consent to ? '' ' in a statement @entity2 's @entity20 said : ' when experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent , then the @entity20 has a responsibility to take action			0
even if the decision might result in criticism , we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required			0
' much of the improvements in @entity2 's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realise solutions to family challenges			0
' unfortunately that ca n't happen in every situation , especially when the life of a child is at stake			0
' ms @entity17 received three weeks ' chemotherapy at @entity32 ( pictured )			1

@entity35 , 17 , wanted to decline chemotherapy for her cancer
@entity36 ruled that ms @entity17 must undergo treatment
the teenager *complained* that she had been ' treated like an animal '
she said the hospital refused to allow her mother to visit her
