' the email asked us if we wanted the baby ourselves			0
my assumption of why i was asked or why we were asked is because of the fact that we had been through this clinic for two years and without a successful pregnancy and maybe they thought this was an easy option for us to take this child instead of continuing on our path to have our own biological child			0
' that ’s just my opinion ' she said , ' but of course we ca n’t accept someone else 's child			0
