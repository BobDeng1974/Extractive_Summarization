within days of the app 's official launch in january 2013 , sexually explicit and pornographic clips began to appear and @entity2 has been heavily criticised for not enforcing this ban sooner			1

elsewhere , sexually suggestive content is also allowed , such as suggestive dancing , as long as the people in the clip are clothed - although close - ups of aroused genitals underneath clothing are banned			1
the new rules forbid any video of sex acts , sex toys used during sex acts , and sexually graphic animations			2
' for more than 99 percent of our users , this does n’t really change anything , ' explained a @entity5 spokesman			1
' for the rest : we do n’t have a problem with explicit sexual content on the internet - we just prefer not to be the source of it			1
' any user that violates this new policy faces being suspended and will only be able to have their account restored once they have removed any offending posts			2
@entity2 had to apologise weeks after the app 's official launch when an explicit clip was made an @entity63			1
under the new rules , severe or repeated violations of the policy may result in permanent suspension			0

' we 're notifying users who have posted explicit sexual content in the past that they have a period to either take down or download their existing content using a new tool we 've created , ' continued the @entity5 spokesman			1
the original minimum age for @entity5 was set at 12 - years - old , but this was raised to 17 shortly after the app was launched , in part because of the high level of explicit content on the site			1
@entity2 also had to apologise weeks after the official launch when an explicit clip was made an @entity63			1
the site claimed the video appeared at the top of the homepage due to a ' human error ' but had refused to take down such pornographic videos because it did n't want to censor its users			2
during yesterday 's new policy announcement , @entity5 said : ' we introduced @entity5 to make it easier for people to find , watch , create and share videos right from their mobile phones			2
' as we ’ve watched the community and your creativity grow and evolve , we ’ve found that there ’s a very small percentage of videos that are not a good fit for our community			0
' so we ’re making an update to our rules and @entity171 to prohibit explicit sexual content			0
