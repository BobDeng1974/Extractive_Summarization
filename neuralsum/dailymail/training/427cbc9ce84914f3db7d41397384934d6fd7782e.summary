drug - driving motorists will be named and shamed on @entity1 if they fail police ‘ walk the line ’ tests			1
suspects are often asked to prove they are fit to be behind the wheel by carrying out tasks such as negotiating a straight line on foot or standing on one leg			0
those who can not do so and are later convicted can then expect to be publicly named and shamed online			0
courts are setting aside extra time to try to convict defendants within ten days of being stopped – enabling police to post footage as soon as the case has finished			0
as part of the joint campaign between police in @entity36 and @entity37 , officers have released a video of a driver high on the horse tranquilliser ketamine who was stopped a few days before @entity18 last year			1
@entity42 , 29 , was ordered to prove he was fit to drive by walking in a straight line – but can clearly be seen weaving unsteadily as he tackles the task			1
the operation aims to crack down on all motoring offences in the run - up to @entity18 and officers will also tweet details about when and where motorists are pulled over for both drink - drive and drug offences			2
warning posters will be placed at the spot where drivers were arrested during last year ’s campaign , while the public are being encouraged to text officers with details of anyone they suspect of drink or drug - driving			1
to raise awareness of their campaign the forces have released footage of @entity42 , arrested last year sergeant @entity69 , the head of roads policing across @entity37 and @entity36 , said a ‘ small minority ’ of motorists refused to believe the law applied to them			1
last december , 211 were arrested on suspicion of drink or drug - driving in @entity37			1
just 135 have so far being convicted of offences			0
another five are still going through the courts			0
in a move to tackle such delays and get rogue drivers off the roads quickly , extra time is being set aside at @entity85 ’ @entity86 in @entity87 to deal with those charged from tomorrow			0
it could result in charged motorists being banned from the roads within ten days of being caught , according to police			2
the footage shows @entity42 spectacularly failing a roadside test after being stopped in @entity95 struggle : after being told to walk in a straight line by a female officer , 29 - year - old @entity42 is seen missing it completely and has to steady himself before failing the task entirely drug use : fray is seen shrugging his shoulders as if unaware of why he can not perform the basic tasks before admitting he had been using horse tranquilliser ketamine sgt @entity108 added : ‘ there is often a delay of a matter of weeks between an individual being charged and them appearing in court			1
but these slots mean those charged with offences early in december could be dealt with by magistrates and banned from the roads in time for @entity18			2
‘ there is no excuse for driving while over the limit or after taking drugs but there remains a small minority who refuse to believe that the law applies to them			0
’ @entity42 , from @entity129 in @entity87 , was convicted of being in charge of a vehicle while unfit through drugs and was banned from driving for four months , fined £ 250 and ordered to pay £ 85 costs and a £ 25 victim surcharge .			0
