@entity0 in @entity1 have released pictures of armed fighters burning musical instruments as the extremist group continues its propaganda assault in the @entity8 country			1
pictures of the heavily armed masked militants watching while a pile of drums burnt in the @entity1 desert were released earlier today - purportedly by the ' media wing ' of the local group			1
it is understood the brightly coloured instruments had been confiscated by the religious police , and were destroyed near the port city of @entity20 , in eastern @entity1			2
' @entity21 ' : the group claims it burned the drums because it believes music is against their religion seized : a statement said the instruments were ' burnt in accordance with @entity31 law ' a message released with the pictures explains : ' @entity34 seized these un-islamic musical instruments in the state of @entity37 ( we call it the city of @entity20 )			1
it adds they were ' burnt in accordance with @entity31 law '			0
whether or not it actually is has been a point of some debate in the @entity31 world , but @entity1 's @entity0 recruits are not the first to burn instruments			2
earlier this year , religious police were filmed beating musicians and destroying their instruments as punishment for playing an ' un-islamic ' keyboard			0
the men were pictured being hit across the back and legs with a wooden stick in a public square in @entity59 after @entity0 's fanatical @entity31 enforcers ruled the electric keyboard was ' offensive to @entity31 '			0
another picture shows two keyboards and what appears to be a lute smashed to pieces after raids thought to have taken place in @entity69 , a few miles to the east of @entity71 in @entity59			0
brand new ? : some of the drums destined for the pyre appeared to never have been used before hidden : the @entity0 militants were careful not to show their faces in any of the pictures these latest pictures from @entity1 are the latest in an onslaught of ' propaganda ' being released by the country 's local branch of @entity0			1
the group , and its march through @entity1 , was brought back into the spotlight with the release of a five minute video showing the murders of a group of @entity89			2
the men were beheaded by the extremists on the beach at @entity93 , allowing them to film the blood running into the @entity95			0
it has since released pictures showing a smart fleet of @entity99 carrying the notorious black flag of @entity101 as they drive in perfect unison through the streets of @entity1			1
propaganda war : @entity1 's @entity0 fighters came back into the spotlight when they beheaded 21 @entity109 men co-ordinated : the group followed it up with pictures purporting to be its own fleet of 4x4s land grab : @entity0 now controls four major cities along the @entity1 coast - including @entity20 , far right , where the pictures of fighters burning instruments were taken , and @entity121 , centre , where the beheadings took place the extremist group has taken control of four major cities along @entity129 's coast , joining forces with groups that formed after the fall of @entity133			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's internationally recognised government has fled to @entity138 , near the @entity109 border , a two - and - a - half hour drive from where the instruments were supposedly burned			0
it shares control of @entity138 and capital @entity142 with other rebel groups			0
