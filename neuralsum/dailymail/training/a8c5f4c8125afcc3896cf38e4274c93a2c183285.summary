by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 12:29 est , 1 september 2012 the navy seal team who carried out the mission to kill @entity4 laughed out loud at their superiors ' preposterous ' suggestion of a cover story in the event that the mission did n't even reach the @entity13 head 's @entity11 compound			1
that is the latest revelation from former @entity17 @entity16 in his first hand account of the @entity4 raid , ' no easy day ' and he makes it clear that not one member of the ultimately successful mission trusted the excuse to work with their supposed allies			1
in the event of being apprehended by any @entity11 forces the men of @entity29 were instructed to say that their secret mission was to locate and extract a missing unmanned drone			1
scroll down for @entity32 former @entity17 @entity33 talking to @entity35 tv show 60 minutes this week about the @entity4 @entity11 raid which he claims to be part of			1
@entity38 said they disguised his appearance for his safety ' we all laughed , ' wrote @entity16 in his book which hits bookstores on september 4th			1
' the story was preposterous			2
we were allies with @entity11 on paper , so if we did lose a drone , the @entity47 would negotiate directly with the @entity11 government to get it back			1
commando : a photo purported to be of @entity33 was published by @entity53 on thursday ' the story did n't wash and would be very difficult to stick to during hours of questioning			0
' the truth is , if we got to that point , no story we could come up with was going to cover up twenty - two seals packing sixty pounds of hi - tech gear on their backs			0
' @entity16 , who has caused political waves with his decision to document the @entity4 raid a little more than a year on from its successful conclusion had other insights into the mission			1
he writes how the night before the raid some of the @entity29 took @entity69 because they could not sleep			1
the 36 - year - old , he wrote his book under the pseudonym @entity73 - but whose real identity was leaked by @entity75 also tells how the team had to a battle with the @entity78 not to take an extra sixty - pound box of cellphone - jamming equipment			0
watching : in this undated image from video seized from @entity4 's compound , the @entity13 chief watches a tv programme showing an image of president @entity87 tension : the raid of @entity4 's @entity91 compound was watched by president @entity87 and his closest advisers in the @entity93 of the @entity94 the special forces soldier did take along $ 200 to use for bribes in the case of mission failure and a digital camera which he used to photograph @entity4 's body and face - photographs which are now under lock and key in the @entity94			1
wearing night vision goggles that cost $ 65,000 , @entity16 admitted to dozing on the helicopter ride to @entity4 's @entity91 compound with his legs dangling out of a top secret stealth helicopter			1
indeed , during the landing , @entity16 was yanked to safety by a fellow seal as the helicopter he was in crashed on landing at the compound			1
he described how the the @entity17 killed @entity4 's son @entity114 as they made their way through the compound towards the terrorist leader 's private quarters on the third floor			1
mission : the @entity13 leader was killed at this compound in @entity91 by @entity123 - and @entity16 claims that if @entity29 had never made it there they were to explain that they were searching for an unmanned drone to their @entity11 allies before revealing the moment a teammate opened fire on a man who had peered through a doorway as they made their way up a flight of stairs			1
he wrote : ' we were less than five steps from getting to the top when i heard suppressed shots			0
cover : no @entity143 is scheduled for release on september 4 ' the point man had seen a man peeking out of the door on the right side of the hallway about ten feet in front of him			0
the man disappeared into the dark room			0
' @entity154 alleges he was the second man to step inside the room and find a man lying on the ground , surrounded by two hysterical women - later revealed to be two of his wives			2
three children , likely to have been @entity4 's own offspring , were cowering in the corner			1
he wrote : ' he was wearing a white sleeveless t - shirt , loose tan pants and a tan tunic			0
the point man 's shots had entered the right side of his head			2
blood and brains spilled out of the side of his skull			0
in his death throes he was still twitching and convulsing			0
' @entity154 and his teammate , named ' @entity178 ' in the book , then fired a series of rounds into his chest to ensure he was dead			0
examining the body , the pair became convinced they had killed @entity4			1
@entity154 wrote : ' the man 's face was mangled from from at least one bullet one and covered in blood			2
his chest was torn up			0
' i started to wipe blood away from his face using a blanket from the bed			0
with each swipe , the face became more familiar			0
' it was strange to see such an infamous face up close			0
lying in front of me was the reason we had been fighting for the last decade			0
' despite alleging that his superiors handed the men of @entity203 6 a lame cover story , @entity16 does outline the incredible level of detail that the @entity35 intelligence community went to in planning the mission			1
a full scale model of @entity4 's house was mocked up in the @entity212 woods and analysts from the @entity214 were aware of every detail of the @entity13 chief 's hideout			1
however , the @entity219 is considering legal action against a former @entity17 whose book describes insider details of the raid that killed @entity4 , but it has not made a final judgment on whether the book actually reveals secrets , a spokesman said friday			1
this undated file photo shows @entity13 leader @entity4 , in @entity229			2
a firsthand account of the @entity17 raid that killed @entity4 contradicts previous accounts , raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when @entity17 first fired upon him @entity219 press secretary @entity236 said @entity33 , who wrote under the pseudonym @entity73 , was deemed to be in violation of two nondisclosure agreements that he signed in 2007 by failing to submit the book for an official security review before it was published			2
@entity154 's lawyer on friday disputed this , saying he believes the decorated former @entity17 has ' earned the right to tell his story			2
' @entity236 would not say what options the @entity219 is considering or when it might act			0
' i write to formally advise you of your material breach and violation of your agreements , and to inform you that the department is considering pursuing against you , and all those acting in concert with you , all remedies legally available to us			0
, ' @entity254 , the @entity219 's top lawyer , wrote in a letter faxed to the author thursday through his publisher			2
@entity263 of the law firm @entity262 wrote to @entity254 on friday that his firm is representing @entity154 and that the author is not in breach of nondisclosure agreements			0
the publisher , meanwhile , said friday that it will begin public sales next week			0
' we see no reason to change our plans , ' @entity270 , a spokeswoman for @entity273 ( @entity35 ) 's @entity272 imprint , said in a statement .			2
