in march last year , scientists believed they had glimpsed - for the first time - the rapid expansion of the universe just after the @entity3 , a theory called cosmic inflation			1
but since then , the @entity7 findings have been repeatedly called in to question , with many saying they did not show what they appeared to			1
and now it seems the final nail has been put in the coffin , as new data is set to reveal that the initial finding was due to the effects of dust in our galaxy - and not cosmic inflation			1
gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe			1
shown here is the pattern observed with the @entity7 telescope , providing what was thought at the time to be evidence for cosmic inflation after the @entity3			1
the results have now been called into question the latest revelations , made using data from @entity37 ’s @entity36 satellite , are set to be unveiled in a paper early next week			1
however , according to the @entity41 , a summary of the paper was briefly posted on the @entity44 ( @entity43 ) website , before being pulled			0
‘ once the " galactic emission " [ dust ] is correctly subtracted , there still remains an excess [ signal ] but it is at present too weak to be considered a detection and could be the result of [ experimental error ] , ’ the summary has been quoted as saying			0
a telescope at the south pole , called @entity7 ( @entity56 of cosmic @entity57 ) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves			2
the instrument examines what is called the cosmic microwave background , the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe			2
the background radiation is not precisely uniform			0
like light , the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space			0
computer models predicted a curl pattern in the radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe 's inflation			2
it did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation			0
this is radiation that was created in the @entity3 and originally discovered in 1964			2
@entity7 measured the large - scale polarisation of this microwave radiation			2
only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern , and only if they have been amplified by inflation			0
the latest findings are not entirely a surprise - but will still be a disappointment for anyone holding out hope that @entity7 was correct			1
the initial results were made using an extremely sensitive detector on an @entity97 telescope			0
the team thought they had found a polarisation of light that would have proved the theory of cosmic inflation			1
to make sure the signal they were detecting was correct , the team subtracted the lensing effect of massive galaxies			0
but at the time , some scientists said the team had not correctly accounted for interstellar dust in our galaxy			1
and now , using data from the @entity36 satellite , which characterised dust in the galaxy , it seems this fear has been confirmed			1
for their initial research , the @entity7 astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the @entity123 , chosen for its very dry air , to aid in the observations			2
their research centered on a theory by @entity128 when something very explosive happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves '			0
the very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave background radiation - the afterglow of the @entity3 - as they pass through space			1
the latest findings are not entirely a surprise - but will still be a disappointment for anyone holding out hope that @entity7 was correct			1
for their research , astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the @entity123 , shown , chosen for its very dry air , to aid in the observations the incredible find was soon dismissed by other research groups who thought the @entity156 team in may have underestimated the effects of dust in the galaxy			0
now , that explanation has been given more credit following a recent study by @entity37 's @entity36 satellite ( shown ) the theory suggests that this initial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble			1
earlier this year experts believed they had seen these gravitational waves and hailed the experiment as a massive step forward - but admitted the theory needed more work			0
' it 's just unbelievable quite honestly , ' professor @entity177 , who helped build the instrument that detected the waves , told @entity181 at the time			0
' this is confirming what is , to me , a wacky idea			0
' these observations have eluded scientists for decades because it ’s difficult to separate the characteristic swirl of light created by gravitational waves , and the dust generated today by the @entity193			2
the @entity156 team hoped to overcome this by looking at cleanest part of the sky , over @entity97			0
but they did n't use dust data compiled by @entity201 's @entity36 satellite , which had mapped the sky at many more frequencies than other satellites .			1

@entity201 scientists are to reveal the @entity7 results were *wrong*
in march 2014 scientists said @entity7 had proved cosmic inflation
this is the theory that the universe rapidly expanded after the @entity3
but *analysis* by the @entity36 satellite suggests this finding was just interstellar dust in our galaxy
the latest findings were to be published next week but leaked today
