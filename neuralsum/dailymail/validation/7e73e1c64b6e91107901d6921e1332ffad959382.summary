speaking two languages really could give you a split personality , researchers have found			1
they say that many speakers have entirely different personalities in each of the languages they speak			0
previously research has even found those who are bilingual even see colours differently			1
researchers say that speaking in another language can change our personality			1
' rather than ask whether speakers of different languages have different minds , he says , ' we ask , can two different minds exist within one person ? ' said psycholinguist @entity19 of @entity20			0
' the extent to which language affects this process has been the focus of a long - standing debate : do different languages cause their speakers to behave differently ? , ' the team wrote			1
' here , we show that fluent @entity30 - @entity29 bilinguals categorize motion events according to the grammatical constraints of the language in which they operate			1
athanasopoulos and colleagues were interested in a particular difference in how @entity29 and @entity30 speakers treat events			1
@entity29 has a grammatical toolkit for situating actions in time : ' i was sailing to @entity44 and i saw @entity45 ' is different from ' i sailed to @entity44 and i saw @entity45			2
' @entity30 does n't have this feature			2
as a result , @entity30 speakers tend to specify the beginnings , middles , and ends of events , but @entity29 speakers often leave out the endpoints and focus in on the action			1
looking at the same scene , for example , @entity30 speakers might say , ' a man leaves the house and walks to the store , ' whereas an @entity29 speaker would just say , ' a man is walking			1
' this linguistic difference seems to influence how speakers of the two languages view events , according to the research			2
' first , as predicted from cross-linguistic differences in motion encoding , participants functioning in a @entity30 testing context prefer to match events on the basis of motion completion to a greater extent than participants in an @entity29 context			1
learning to speak a second language at any point in your life could help keep your brain sharp as you age , a study suggests			2
the @entity84 detected a pattern of slower mental decline among the bilingual in a group of 835 born in 1936			0
they were given an intelligence test in 1947 at the age of 11 , then retested in their early 70s between 2008 and 2010			0
a total of 262 participants could communicate in at least one language other than @entity29			1
of those , 195 learnt the second language before the age of 18			2
those who spoke two or more languages had significantly better cognitive abilities in their 70s than their peers			0
the strongest effect of bilingualism was seen in general intelligence and reading tests			0
' our study shows that bilingualism , even when acquired in adulthood , may benefit the ageing brain , ' study authors said			0
' second , when participants suffer verbal interference in @entity29 , their categorization behavior is congruent with that predicted for @entity30 and when we switch the language of interference to @entity30 , their categorization becomes congruent with that predicted for @entity29			1
' these findings show that language effects on cognition are context - bound and transient , revealing unprecedented levels of malleability in human cognition			0
' previous research found a similar result			0
between 2001 and 2003 , linguists @entity132 and @entity134 asked over a thousand bilinguals whether they ' feel like a different person ' when they speak different langauges			0
nearly two - thirds said they did			0
scientists have also found that regularly speaking in a second language makes you literally see the world in a different way			2
color perception is an ideal way of testing bilingual concepts because there is a huge variation between where different languages place boundaries on the color spectrum .			0

researchers studied particular difference between @entity29 and @entity30
found *people* thought differently depending language used
