published : 06:03 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 5 july 2013 @entity0 has filed a patent for a pair of headphones that automatically adjust the volume of music if they 're not inserted far enough into the ear			1
the tech company has been criticised in the past for the headphones it sells with iphones and ipods because they ' leak ' music , meaning a listener 's tunes can be heard by people around them			1
designs for the in - ear headphones , also known as earbuds , in this latest patent have a built - in microphone that can assess how much much music is leaking and adjust the volume accordingly			1
this image , taken from the recently filed @entity0 patent , shows how the new earbuds would work			1
when inserted into the ear , a built - in microphone assesses how much music is leaking in and out			1
if the seal between the bud and the ear canal is broken , the volume will be automatically adjusted accordingly when inserted into the ear , a built - in microphone assesses how much music is leaking in and out			1
it also checks for ambient and background noises			0
if the seal between the bud and the ear canal is broken - determined by whether the microphone can pick up a lot of background noise - the volume of the music will be automatically adjusted accordingly			1
alternatively , a warning message will appear on the screen to tell the listener their music is n't at the optimum level			0
according to the patent , the buds could track variations in the seal between the speaker section of the earbud and the wearer 's ear canal			2
if the earbud is not inserted far enough , the microphone will realise the seal has been broken			0
the buds will then either warn the listener through an on - screen message , or automatically adjust the volume			1
the microphone can also listen to ambient noises and increase the volume if the wearer is in a loud environment			0
this adjustment additionally means the earbuds will better fit people 's different sized ears			2
the patent was filed earlier this month to the @entity78 and it will need to be approved before @entity0 can begin working on , and ultimately selling , the device			1
it said : ' the speakers in earbud headphone are encased in earbuds			0
the headphones @entity0 released with early versions of its iphones and @entity87 , pictured , did n't fit in the ear properly and customers complained they ' leaked ' music			1
this meant people around them could hear what they were listening to ' during use , the earbuds are placed in the ears of a user			0
when properly seated in the user 's ear , the earbuds form a seal			2
' if the seal between the earbuds and the user 's ear is formed correctly , music can be played back satisfactorily			2
in september 2012 , @entity0 released its @entity107 , pictured			2
they were designed to fit more snugly in the ear in a bid to reduce noise leakage			0
however , customers complained they were uncomfortable ' poor seals can adversely affect performance			0
for example , noise cancellation operations can be degraded and volume levels can be affected			0
' explaining how its earbud design would prevent this , @entity0 adds : ' in response to measured reductions in seal quality , actions may be taken such as generating informative messages for the user , increasing overall earbud volume , correcting mismatched balance between left and right earbuds , adjusting equalization settings , and making adjustments to noise cancellation circuitry			1
' @entity133 analyst @entity132 told @entity134 : ' @entity0 must be careful not to invade or choke off its accessories market – they ’ve never made great headphones or accessories			2
' the headphones @entity0 released with the early versions of its iphones and @entity87 did n't fit in the ear properly and were renowned for ' leaking ' music			1
in september 2012 , @entity0 released its @entity107 which were first shipped with the @entity143			0
they were designed to fit more snugly in the ear in a bid to reduce noise leakage			0
however , customers complained that they were uncomfortable and still did n't fit properly .			0

@entity78 filed for a new design of in - ear headphones , known as earbuds
@entity0 's earbuds automatically adjust music volume if not inserted properly
the firm has been criticised in the past for so - called ' leaky ' headphones
