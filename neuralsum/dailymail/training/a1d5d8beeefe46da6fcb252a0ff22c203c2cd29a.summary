@entity0 and @entity1 take on @entity3 new boy @entity2 on sunday – but the @entity5 boss believes he boasts a pair of @entity3 hopefuls of his own			1
midfielder @entity8 was included in @entity10 ’s squad in august only to withdraw because of injury , while defender @entity12 was an unused substitute against @entity13 last year			1
the @entity15 duo have not been involved since those respective calls and remain uncapped			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 believes @entity8 ( left ) and @entity12 can win @entity3 squad recalls @entity0 , though , feels both players can again stake a claim for international honours this season			1
‘ could @entity8 play for @entity3 ? for sure , ’ said @entity0 , whose side travel to @entity23 on the back of four straight wins			1
‘ he ’s been a significant part of our season in a positive way			0
if i was to mark him i ’d say seven out of 10 , but i think he can get eights and nines here			0
‘ i ’ve really enjoyed watching him play			0
all he needs to do is build on what he ’s done			0
to come from our big rivals ( @entity34 ) and to have played the way he has is a real testament to his character			0
’ @entity8 ( left ) has impressed for the @entity15 since joining the club from local rivals @entity34 this summer @entity12 , meanwhile , has played every minute of @entity5 ’s last three wins in the @entity39 having previously been out of the side			1
and @entity0 said : ‘ you ca n’t argue with his record ( since he came into side )			2
‘ he ’s a player that , when he ’s confident , can get in the @entity3 squad , which he did during my time here			2
‘ the key to @entity12 is having a sustained run and staying injury - free , which he is having at the moment			2
when he gets his confidence he ’s an outstanding centre - half			2
’ @entity0 hailed @entity12 ( left ) as an ' outstanding centre - half when he gets his confidence ' @entity8 , though , perhaps faces a tougher task at the heart of @entity3 ’s midfield			1
‘ we ’ve got a good batch of central midfield players in the @entity3 squad , so @entity8 has good competition , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ but i ’ve got no problems with @entity10 ’s selection , and neither has @entity8			2
‘ he ’s a very simple player to manage			0
he makes the game simple			0
he ’s low maintenance – he comes in , does his work , is terrific and goes home – lovely			0
