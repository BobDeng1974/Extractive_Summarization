by @entity0 @entity1 will be hoping to make a big impression at @entity3 this season after an up - and - down campaign last year			1
and the flying winger is certainly starting as he means to go on - judging by his new footwear he has been sporting back at @entity3 's @entity9 training ground			0
the @entity3 players reported back for the first day of pre season training on wednesday all wearing the club 's new home shirt - but it was difficult not to be distracted by the frightening design of the 21 - year - old 's footwear			0
the former @entity30 man is known to be a fan of bright footwear on the pitch but his new boots take it to a whole new level			0
@entity1 will be keen to provide a better impression than his boots this season after an up - and - down year where he managed to be one of @entity3 's best players but was also farmed out to @entity43 on loan later in the campaign			1
@entity46 : @entity1 was brilliant for @entity3 in their 3 - 0 win over @entity48 and throughout the early season all change : but then the winger ended up on loan at @entity43 in the second half of the season			2

@entity56 is wearing pink and blue boots ahead of the new season
@entity3 - *including* @entity1 - returned to training on wednesday
*youngster* is aiming to impress after being farmed out on loan to @entity43
