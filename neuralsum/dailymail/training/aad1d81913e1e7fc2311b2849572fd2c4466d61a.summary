the device is hooked over the ears and worn across the forehead like futuristic sunglasses a band worn across the forehead for twenty minutes a day could zap migraines that blight the lives of millions			1
the device - which ' looks like something out of @entity9 ' - delivers electric impulses to the supraorbital nerve that controls sensation in and around the eye			1
a study found those who used it were suffering about a third fewer debilitating headaches after a couple of months			0
the number of people whose migraines were reduced by half or more were also tripled , according to the findings published online in @entity24			2
professor @entity25 said : ' the device consists of a thin silver band that looks like something out of @entity9			1
' it is hooked over the ears and worn across the forehead like futuristic sunglasses			0
patients don it once daily for 20 minutes			1
' a similar technique has worked on patients with pain in other parts of the body such as the back			0
it involves connecting the device to the nerve responsible and sending an electronic pulse to prevent it from causing pain			2
prof @entity25 , of @entity44 in @entity45 , was also pleased there were no side effects from the treatment			0
he said : ' these results are exciting because they were similar to those of drugs that are used to prevent migraine			2
' but often those drugs have many side effects and frequently they are bad enough that people decide to quit taking the drug			0
then they received either the stimulation 20 minutes a day for three months or a sham device where the electric impulses delivered were at levels too low to have any effect			1
@entity9 's lt @entity77 : a similar band has been developed to treat migraines those given the stimulation had fewer migraine days in the third month compared to the first - falling from seven to five while there was no change for those given the dummy			1
the study also found 38 per cent for those who had the stimulation saw their symptoms halve compared to 12 per cent in the control group			2
around one in four women and one in 12 men experience migraines which can be set off by alcohol , stress , fluorescent lighting and foods such as chocolate , red wine and caffeine			1
the @entity106 rates migraines as a major cause of disability worldwide and it has been estimated to be the most costly neurological disorder in @entity110			1
some researchers have linked them to hormonal changes while others have argued a fall in air pressure reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood			0
lower oxygen levels may cause blood vessels in the brain to dilate - triggering a persistent pain			0
it has also been speculated a drop in pressure affects the fluid protecting the brain inside the skull - leading to increased pressure on brain tissue			0
the device , known as @entity133 , is @entity134 marked and costs around £ 260			1
it has been submitted to the @entity137 in the @entity138 but has not yet been approved			0
the study was published in the journal @entity24 by the @entity141 .			0

migraine sufferers who wore the band for 20 minutes a day saw headache days reduce from seven to five a month
around one in four women and one in 12 men experience migraines
the device costs around £ 260 and is available in @entity110
