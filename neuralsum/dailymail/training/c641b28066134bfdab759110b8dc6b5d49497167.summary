it has laid waste to the tribal chiefdoms of @entity3 , leaving hundreds dead , but the @entity5 crisis began with just one healer 's claims to special powers			1
the outbreak need never have spread from @entity10 , health officials revealed , except for a herbalist in the remote eastern border village of @entity14			1
' she was claiming to have powers to heal @entity5			1
cases from @entity10 were crossing into @entity3 for treatment , ' said @entity19 , the top medical official in the hard - hit district of @entity21			1
during her funeral , women around the other towns got infected			0
' @entity5 has killed more than 1,350 people since it emerged in southern @entity10 at the start of the year , spreading first to @entity35 and cutting a gruesome and gory swathe through eastern @entity3 since may			1
experts are now being offered £ 6.5 million to find ways to save the lives of people struck down by the ebola virus			1
the emergency appeal has been launched by the @entity43 and the @entity45 health research charity			1
development secretary @entity46 said the money , which is part of an existing fund for research into health in humanitarian crises , will be used to improve knowledge around the spread of the disease			1
two medical staff are bringing a weak patient who has been in contact with people infected with @entity5 to the admission the tropical pathogen can turn people into de facto corpses with little higher brain function and negligible motor control days before they die			1
the virus attacks almost every section of tissue , reducing organs and flesh in the most aggressive infections to a pudding - like mush which leeches or erupts from the body			0
the virus is highly infectious through exposure to bodily fluids , and its early rapid spread in west @entity78 was attributed in part to relatives touching victims during traditional funeral rites			2
the herbalist 's mourners fanned out across the rolling hills of the @entity87 tribal chiefdoms , starting a chain reaction of infections , deaths , funerals and more infections			2
a worrying outbreak turned into a major epidemic when the virus finally hit @entity21 city on june 17			2
an ethnically - diverse , @entity98 - speaking city of 190,000 , @entity21 already has the highest incidence of @entity100 - another viral haemorrhagic disease - in the world			0
but the brutality and cold efficiency of the ebola virus - described in medical literature as a ' molecular shark ' - caught the city 's shabby , chaotic hospital off - guard			0
@entity112 doctors wear masks before working at the @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity3 crumpled photographs of dead nurses cover noticeboards on the flaking walls outside the maternity unit and in the administration block			1
twelve nurses have been among 277 people to die since the first case showed up in @entity21 hospital			2
a further ten have been infected with @entity5 and survived			1
' the nurses who lost their lives and those who got infected would never have gone in knowing that they would get infected , ' @entity19 , the district medical officer , said			0
' we are fighting a battle that is new			0
@entity5 is new here and we are all learning as we go along			1
' the first case at the hospital was a woman who had partially miscarried , having probably passed the virus to her unborn child			0
the facility boasts the only @entity100 fever isolation unit in the world , set apart from the main building , and a makeshift @entity5 unit was quickly set up there			1
it was then that the nurses began dying			0
as head sister of the @entity100 fever ward for more than 25 years , @entity145 was credited with attending to more haemorrhagic fever patients than anyone in the world			0
she had survived @entity100 fever herself , but was no match for the ebola virus when it got into her bloodstream from a patient in july			0
she was dead within days , along with fellow nurses @entity156 and @entity158 , and ambulance driver @entity159			0
the deaths prompted a strike of 100 nurses , who complained of poor management of the @entity5 centre			2
' wherever the ebola virus strikes for the first time , there is a heavy toll on healthcare workers because they do n't have experience with it , ' @entity19 said			0
' the ebola virus is deadly and unforgiving			0
the slightest mistake you make , you will get infected			0
' development secretary @entity46 , pictured , said the money will be used to improve knowledge around the spread of @entity5 experts are being offered £ 6.5 million to find ways to save the lives of people struck down by the ebola virus			1

development secretary @entity46 said the money , which is part of an existing fund for research into health in humanitarian crises , will be used to improve knowledge around the spread of the disease			1
' we are launching an emergency call for research to strengthen what we know about @entity5 and how it spreads , ' said ms @entity46			1
' this will help us better equip those working on the ground so they can tackle the outbreak as effectively as possible and prevent more people contracting this terrible disease			2
' this work , supported by the @entity205 , should also draw lessons for the global community on how to deal with future outbreaks of @entity5 and other infectious diseases			2
' expert teams are being asked to submit their proposals , providing strong evidence and analysis of the disease including how it is diagnosed and treated , by september 8			0
@entity45 director dr @entity215 said fast and effective research is required in this emergency situation and could be of use in the future			1
' the gravity of the @entity5 epidemic in @entity78 demands an urgent response , and we believe rapid research into humanitarian interventions and therapeutics can have an impact on treatment and containment during the present outbreak			1
' what we learn could also change the way we approach future outbreaks , providing us with tested tools and techniques that were not available to public health authorities this time			2
' @entity237 of @entity238 which is managing the funding , said : ' the communities that are facing this terrible outbreak have the right to expect the best possible response from the international community			2
' research might not seem like an urgent action , but the courageous health professionals that are working to save lives and control this outbreak are in great need of better evidence			1
' @entity252 , a hugely admired doctor and the country 's leading @entity5 specialist , died after saving more than 100 lives , and at least nine nurses have died since			1
there are 80 beds in the hospital 's @entity5 centre , almost double its capacity			2
shifts are voluntary , and many nurses have refused to work in the unit , while those who remain are overworked and exhausted			0
some staff say they have gone weeks without a day off , and 12 - hour shifts are par for the course			0
sister @entity268 was quoted by the @entity270 newspaper as saying she was nervous about the high number of staff deaths			0
' my family do not want me to come here anymore			0
they think i will die , they do n't want to be around me in case i give them @entity5 , ' she told the @entity279 - based daily			2
by the time the article came out on august 9 , @entity280 had already been dead five days , aged just 42			0
her husband @entity282 , 45 , said she was moved from maternity to the @entity5 unit after a crash course of just one week			2
one day after work , she began to feel feverish and feared the worst , checking herself in for tests which came back positive			0
' they transferred her to the @entity5 ward that day and four days later she died , ' @entity282 said , accusing the hospital of providing inadequate protective clothing			2
the hospital said staff training had hugely improved in recent weeks , with the help of global aid agencies and the @entity295			0
the @entity5 outbreak has infected 848 people and claimed 365 lives in @entity3 since the herbalist began inviting clients across the border with promises of salvation			1
' these figures tell us one thing : @entity5 is here with us and its impact on us is real , ' @entity307 , the government minister for the eastern region , told a news conference in @entity21 on saturday			1
' it is a disease that spreads very fast , without regard for academic or economic status , political affiliation , age , ethnic grouping , gender or religion			0
' up to three quarters of those contracting @entity5 are women , health officials have revealed			1
the disease is disproportinately infecting women in @entity78 because they are often nurses , traders and primary care - givers , the @entity321 reports			0
