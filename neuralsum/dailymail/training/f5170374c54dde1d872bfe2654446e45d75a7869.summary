by @entity0 published : 17:35 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 01:33 est , 19 july 2012 little miracle : @entity2 recovering from the attack at home with his mother @entity5 to see his brave smile , you would hardly believe that it is only six weeks since two - year - old @entity2 nearly lost his life when a neighbour ’s crazed dog ripped his face to shreds			1
the toddler was given a 50/50 chance of surviving the savaging by the pet , thought to be a @entity19 bull terrier or similar			2
although the dog was destroyed , its owner can not be prosecuted because the attack took place in a private garden , rather than on a public street			1
yesterday , @entity2 ’s parents called for action to close this ‘ loophole ’ in the @entity30			1
unlike in @entity31 or @entity32 , the law in @entity34 allows ‘ devil dog ’ owners to escape prosecution in cases such as this			0
the dog , named @entity41 , belonged to 15 - year - old @entity42 and his unemployed father @entity43 , of @entity44			1
and far from showing any shame or remorse for the attack , @entity42 later took to @entity48 to declare : ‘ i could n’t give a toss			1
’ his father blamed the boy ’s parents for not keeping a closer eye on him , insisting : ‘ if you ’re a parent you have to look after your children 24 hours a day			2
if it was n’t a dog it could have been a paedophile			2
’ last year , during a drugs raid at the house , the dog had attacked two police officers and not even a blast from a @entity64 stun gun could subdue it			2
yesterday , @entity2 ’s mother , @entity65 , 22 , said : ‘ you do n’t see a child looking like @entity2 , because they do n’t normally survive an attack like that			1
' doctors gave @entity2 just a 50/50 chance of survival			1
it ’s nothing short of a miracle that he is here at all			0
’ before the attack : the toddler needed seven hours of surgery to rebuild his face after being attacked by @entity42 and @entity43 's @entity19 bull terrier @entity41 outside his home in @entity44 @entity2 spent a week in a coma , and even when he came round it was several days until the family realised the sight in one of his eyes had been saved			1
' like father , like son ' : @entity43 , whose 15 - year - old son @entity42 said he ' could n't give a toss ' that his dog had savaged little @entity93 his father @entity94 , 25 , said : ‘ we were n’t sure how much he would be able to see out of his eye until my dad visited and he shouted out , “ @entity99 ! ” ’ @entity2 is now out of hospital , but his mother says : ‘ he used to be happy and smiley all the time			1
now he does have bursts of anger			0
and he has terrible nightmares and he ’ll wake up dripping with sweat and screaming and thrashing about			0
‘ he saw a dog in the street the other day and he was petrified and said , “ dog bite , dog bite ! ”			0
’ the couple told of the moment when doctors gave them just ten seconds to kiss their mauled son goodbye before taking him for immediate surgery , warning that it could be their last chance to see him alive			2
miss @entity65 said : ‘ i could n’t kiss his face – it was n’t there any more			1
so i kissed his stomach and told him , “ @entity119 loves you ”			0
’ it is only thanks to the expertise of surgeons who performed a ten - hour operation that @entity2 , who had to have most of his face reconstructed , survived			1
the attack happened on the @entity126 weekend early last month , as the couple were at their home with @entity2 and their other son , four - year - old @entity132			1
@entity2 ’s grandfather , @entity133 , 49 , had been helping to renovate the family ’s bathroom and walked out to his van when the two boys followed			2
their mother , who is pregnant with the couple ’s third child , said : ‘ seconds later we came out			0
we could see @entity132 – but not @entity2			2
’ they began a frantic search and realised that the toddler had wandered into the @entity145 ’ back garden only when another neighbour yelled : ‘ a dog ’s got him ! a dog ’s got him ! ’ despite being bitten himself , mr @entity150 managed to get @entity2 away , and his son said : ‘ i saw @entity153 with @entity2 cradled in his arms , but it did n’t look like @entity2			1
' all i could see was bubbles of red coming out of his face			0
‘ his eye was ripped open			0
basically his whole face had been ripped to shreds			0
‘ it was horrific – like something from a horror film			0
not something you see in real life			0
’ paramedics arrived within minutes , followed by an on - call doctor , police cars and a helicopter ambulance which landed in the nearby park			0
during the mayhem , @entity2 ’s ear , which had been found near the scene , was handed to paramedics in a handkerchief			2
aggression : two pit bull - style dogs seen leaping up at @entity42 's house near to where @entity2 was attacked mr @entity183 recalled : ‘ @entity5 was on the floor crying			1
some bloke was trying to comfort me because i was just in tears			0
‘ you ’re meant to protect your kids are n’t you ? more than anything i was angry			0
' i kept thinking this should n’t have happened			0
’ last night environment secretary @entity193 said : ‘ every dog owner needs to be held responsible for what their animal does and we want to change the law so that if your dog mauls someone on private property , you will face prosecution , as happens if an attack takes place in public			1
’ scene : an alleyway behind @entity210 in @entity44 , where the attack happened in june horror : the attack happened while @entity2 was being looked after by his grandfather in @entity210 ( above )			1

@entity2 savaged by @entity215 while playing at his home
toddler *lucky* to survive after needing hours of surgery to rebuild his face
@entity222 's 15 - year - old owner @entity42 said he ' i could n’t give a toss '
no - one will face charges over toddler attack as it was on private property
