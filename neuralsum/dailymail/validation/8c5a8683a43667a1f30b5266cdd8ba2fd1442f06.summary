they were worlds apart in life			2
@entity2 , a @entity3 actor			1
@entity4 , a qualified auto - electrician and the son of duck farmers from country @entity8			2
but both men , the doting fathers of little girls , died just years apart from the same phenomenon - the abuse of prescription drugs , described as an epidemic in @entity16 by anti-drug abuse groups			1
now @entity18 , the @entity20 winner 's father , has joined an effort to fight prescription drug abuse after he was moved by a ' heartwrenching ' letter from @entity4 's mother , @entity24			1
the letter said @entity4 ' wanted to stay well for @entity26 ' , his young daughter , ' but the hideous disease of addiction slowly crept back up again ' and he died of a pain medication overdose in 2010			2
' his life mattered , ' @entity24 wrote , ' and that is why i do what i do for others in similar circumstances			1
he was posthumously awarded an @entity52 for @entity53 after the performance and his death @entity18 , @entity2 's father , has been involved in efforts to increase awareness about the dangers of prescription drug abuse since his son 's death in august 2008			1
his latest position is as patron of the not - for - profit @entity66 mr @entity2 's own son accidentally died around two years earlier after he consumed a lethal cocktail of six prescription medications			1
the 28 - year - old actor was found dead in his @entity73 apartment , shortly after completing filming for @entity51 , where he starred as @entity48			2
' he was just desperately trying to get to sleep , ' mr @entity2 said			1
after receiving the emotional letter from @entity24 and @entity77 from @entity78 , @entity8 , and hosting a follow - up meeting with them last year , mr @entity2 today announced he will be the patron of the new not - for - profit @entity81 , which will raise awareness about the dangers and solutions to prescription drug abuse			1
' i met @entity24 and @entity77 last year ... @entity24 had reached out to me about maybe a year earlier or so with a little note , a letter really , a lovely letter that was quite compelling , ' he said			2
' it was explaining what they had to go through ( with @entity4 )			0
it was really quite heartwrenching			2
' in a statement , mr @entity2 said his son 's profile was probably ' a little higher than many other loved ones ' who had experienced tragic deaths from prescription drug abuse			1
' if something positive can come from ( @entity2 's ) passing such as raising awareness of the problem and moving towards some form of live monitoring for prescription medication , then my job is done			1
' @entity24 and @entity77 have lobbied the government in favour of measures to crack down on prescription drug abuse since @entity4 's death			1
@entity4 had grappled with an addiction to pain medication for some sixteen years , mrs @entity113 told @entity116 , following a devastating car accident in august 1994 , when he was just 18 - years - old			1
@entity2 was posthumously awarded the @entity52 for @entity53 in the film @entity51 , following his stellar performance @entity4 was caught in a car accident in 1994			1
as a result of his accident and his recovery , mr @entity4 became addicted to pain killers and other medications , including ' benzos and opiates ' , his mother said mr @entity2 said : ' they 've done a great job - others around them have too - but those people who were the ones who influenced me enough to get involved in the project			1
' mrs @entity113 told @entity116 she was touched by the praise from mr @entity2			1
' we caught up with him in @entity138 late last year , ' mrs @entity113 said			2
' we 've spent a lot of time sharing our stories about our sons ... ' there 's often times only the people who have been through it understand what we 've been going through			0
' @entity2 died of an overdose in august 2008 after consuming a lethal cocktail of six different prescription medications			1
mr and mrs @entity113 have worked hard to raise awareness about prescription drug abuse in regional @entity8			1
they are lobbying for a mandatory national @entity152 to help stem the epidemic			0
@entity81 said pharmaceutical drugs were linked to 82 per cent of overdose deaths in @entity8 in 2013 alone			2
for the past three years i have been a volunteer on the @entity158 , the subcommittee i am on is the ' @entity159 ' ( see terms of reference attached )			0
you may ask why @entity18 ? well in 1994 , my 18 - year - old son suffered critical injuries in a single car accident			1
as a result of his injuries , and subsequent operations he became addicted to pain killers & other medications of all different sorts & varieties including @entity173 & opiates			0
you may well be aware of the trauma on families trying to assist , live with , and save a loved one who is on huge amounts of the above			0
@entity4 was on a rollercoaster for 16 years , many times he went though rehabs and ' got well ' however the @entity183 continued and we found ourselves and our lives had become as unmanageable as @entity4 's			0
we sought help from a family support group , @entity188 , and we found if we were ' tooled up ' and implemented strategies & boundaries in our lives we could ' cope '			0
tough love became the order of the day and there were times when we felt we pushed @entity4 too far with our rules however , when we changed and did not enable him , he too changed for the better			0
' i remember i once packed his things and asked him to leave home as it was us or his meds			0
he denied taking anything but his pupils & unloving behaviour told us otherwise			0
that was the hardest thing i ever had to do but it was worth the risk to help save him			0
you see @entity18 , we had already lost a 2 year old daughter in a farm accident in 1980 & an 18 year old son in a motorbike accident in 2004			2
we were determined to save @entity211			0
in 2008 , whilst in yet another rehab , @entity4 discovered he was the father of a four - year - old girl			2
he was overjoyed as we were also as we thought this would be the turning point for him			0
@entity4 graduated from the rehab in 6 months and decided to come home and work on our farm and also volunteer at the rehab to help others			0
he lived at home and his little girl lived us for some of the week as well			0
@entity4 was an amazing and doting dad , he wanted to stay well for @entity26			0
we thought the bad times were behind us but the hideous disease of addiction slowly crept back into our lives again			0
his visits home become less and less and the doctor shopping started again			0
after a long and worrying time we lost our battle to keep @entity211 alive and he died of an overdose of @entity233 in 2010			0
his life mattered and that is why i do what i do for others in similar circumstances			1
of his son @entity2 , @entity18 said : ' if something positive can come from ( @entity2 's ) passing such as raising awareness of the problem and moving towards some form of live monitoring for prescription medication , then my job is done '			1
