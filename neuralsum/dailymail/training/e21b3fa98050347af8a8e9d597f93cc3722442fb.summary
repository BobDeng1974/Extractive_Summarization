his ongoing hospitalisation has caused growing concern in @entity10 , a nation of 50 million people that largely reveres him for being the nation 's first democratically elected president who sought to bring the country together after centuries of racial division			0
tests at 1 @entity106 near @entity10 's capital , @entity5 , detected the lung infection , presidential spokesman @entity104 previously said in a statement			1
public concern : broadcast vans parked near the 1 @entity106 where @entity10 's former president @entity1 is hospitalised security : @entity10 military police officers check cars entering the 1 @entity106 ' @entity1 is receiving appropriate treatment and he is responding to the treatment , ' @entity104 said , referring to mr @entity1 by his clan name as many do in @entity10 as a sign of affection			1

‘ with a hint of annoyance , ( the doctor ) said , “ @entity1 , take a look at your chest , ” ’ mr @entity1 recounted			1
‘ he pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger than the other			0
’ surgeons immediately cut into his chest and removed two litres ( half a gallon ) of liquid from his lungs , which tested positive for tuberculosis			0
doctors at the time suggested mr @entity1 contracted the disease from his damp prison cell			1
about 1.4 million people worldwide die each year from tuberculosis , a bacterial infection which can stay dormant for years			2
it also can cause permanent lung damage , though in his autobiography mr @entity1 says doctors caught it in time			1
relations : mr @entity1 's last foreign visitor is believed to have been @entity225 secretary of state @entity226 , who had lunch with him and his wife , @entity45 , at their @entity17 home in august however , tuberculosis can return to trouble those previously infected , properly treated or not , and previous damage could have been missed , @entity232 said			1
