it has been one of the most frustrating paradoxes of modern science - that light exists both as a wave and particle at the same time but can never be seen in both states simultaneously			1
@entity8 was the first person to describe this apparent dual state of light in 1905 in an attempt to explain some of the apparently contradictory behaviour it displays			1
yet when scientists attempt to observe these states , it has only ever been able to see light behave as photon particle or as an electromagnetic wave			1
the bottom ' slice ' of the image shows the particles , while the top image shows light as a wave but now researchers based at the @entity35 in @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , have captured the first ever snapshot of light behaving as both a wave and particle			1
the work shows that @entity8 was right when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation could behave as both a wave and a particle at the same time			1
scientists have developed a camera system that lets users see round corners using laser light			2
the system takes advantage of the way light is reflected and refracted to reconstruct the shape of objects outside the field of view			0
researchers at the @entity59 and the @entity60 in @entity61 , used a laser to scatter light on a surface			2
is shone on a surface in a demonstration , a laser was shone on a white wall , while a camera watches the scene			0
all it can see initially through the lens is a ‘ spot ’ of light			0
a computer records the image and the data is processed so the outlines of an object behind the screen gradually appear			0
the technique for capturing the image could be used to help open up new areas of superfast computers that exploit the quantum states of materials			1
he said : ' this experiment demonstrates that , for the first time ever , we can film quantum mechanics - and its paradoxical nature - directly			2
' being able to image and control quantum phenomena at the nanometer scale like this opens up a new route towards quantum computing			2
' the wave - like behaviour of light can be seen clearly when sunlight is refracted through a prism and splits into the different colours according to the wavelengths of the light			0
however , it can also be seen behaving like a particle - like photons hurled out as radiation by materials like uranium or when gas high in the atmosphere is battered by the solar wind to produce the aurora over the poles			0
in a paper published in the journal @entity121 , the research team conducted an experiment and then used electrons to image the light			1
by firing a pulse of laser light at a tiny metal wire suspended on graphene , this added energy to the particle wire and caused them to vibrate			0
the @entity134 ( shown above ) is caused by photons particles thrown out by gas atoms high in the @entity138 's atmosphere as they collide with high energy charged particles carried by the solar wind from the sun white light splitting into different colours through a prism ( above ) shows how it behaves like a wave @entity148 then traveled along the wire in two possible directions			0
when the waves travelling in opposite directions meet each other they form a new ' standing wave ' of light			0
by then firing a stream of electrons close to the nanowire , they were able to image this wave in an ultrafast microscope due to the way the electrons sped up or slowed down			0
dr @entity166 said that the resulting image produces a fingerprint of the wave - nature of light while also simultaneously demonstrating that it is a particle too			1
the electrons pass close to the standing wave of light , they hit the photons it contains , again affecting the resulting image .			1

@entity178 researchers have used lasers and nanowires to capture the images
scientists have been attempting to image light in both states for *decades*
@entity8 was first to describe light as being both a wave and particle
the experiment could lead to new types of super fast ' quantum computers '
