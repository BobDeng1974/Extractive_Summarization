inspector @entity0 claims police resources were so stretched that officers were not making arrests ' out of necessity ' police are choosing not to arrest drunks on friday and saturday nights because there are as few as four officers on duty in some city centres			1
a senior officer in @entity13 has claimed that resources are so stretched that officers are not arresting those drunk and disorderly ‘ out of necessity ’ , for fear that there will be no one left to police the streets if they take offenders into custody			1
inspector @entity0 , chairman of the @entity13 branch of the @entity24 , said as few as four officers were on duty at some times of the night in the city centre and taking a bobby off the beat to process a drunken yob at a police station would ‘ reduce the beleaguered thin blue line yet further ’			1
his comments have been echoed by @entity34 , chairman of the @entity24 , who said officers across the country faced a dilemma about whether to arrest binge - drinking thugs or risk letting them loose to create further disorder because there simply ‘ are n’t enough officers to go around ’			1
the row comes after dr @entity44 , the leader of @entity47 ’s @entity46 doctors , said police should adopt a zero - tolerance approach to binge drinking by arresting drunks who ended up in accident and emergency			1
however yesterday inspector @entity0 said the plan by the president of the @entity57 was ‘ poorly thought out and not based in the reality of where our police service now finds itself ’			1
a senior officer has claimed that police in @entity13 are unable to arrest drunks on friday and saturday nights because there are just four officer patrolling the city centre			2
@entity68 , @entity69 in the city he added : ‘ every weekend in @entity72 we battle to keep a presence on the streets			2
‘ the reality behind the fact that arrests for drink - related offences have reduced is that police officers out of necessity are not making arrests			1
quite where these additional detainees will be kept is quite another challenge			0
’ yesterday local police and crime commissioner @entity86 said : ‘ it ’s unrealistic to expect the police , with all the other demands it faces , to police drunkenness in any of our towns and cities			0
’ recently @entity96 police and crime commissioner @entity97 revealed that there are only 18 constables available to deploy in @entity100 on an average saturday night			2
and mr @entity34 said officers up and down the country were having to come up with ‘ imaginative alternatives ’ to arrest when faced with drunken behaviour at weekends while forces were at their busiest			2
he said : ‘ i have no doubt this is something that is not particular to city centres such as @entity13 , @entity109 , the @entity110 or @entity111 , it ’s happening across the @entity47			0
’ dr @entity44 said the threat of arrest would deter people from drinking too much and reduce the pressure on @entity117 arrest a reveller on @entity69 in @entity119 he said there were not enough officers to cope with the impact of 24 - hour drinking laws introduced by @entity124 in the wake of police funding cuts , adding : ‘ on friday and saturday nights you get to a crescendo of activity , typically between 1am and 2am where all resources are out			1
‘ you may be dealing with a complete idiot , who in the normal course of events would be arrested for public disorder			0
but where you are the only one left and other calls are coming in , you ca n’t do that			0
’ @entity141 chief constable @entity140 said : ‘ when an arrest is made it can take an officer off the street for the rest of their shift			0
‘ the use of other powers , such as making people leave town centres who are too heavily intoxicated , ensures that we keep officers where they are most needed			2
‘ arresting and prosecuting all of those who are too drunk to take care of themselves would place a huge demand on police and the criminal justice system			0
we respond proportionately , using the powers we have available to us			0
