while it sounds like science fiction , these planets may offer scientists a new avenue in their search for alien life			2
the warmth of a sun has long been thought to be a key ingredient to life			0
but astronomers say ' rogue ' , sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials this is according to @entity24 , an astrophysicist with the @entity25 in @entity26 , who has taken a look at how life can form on rogue planets			1
writing in @entity30 , he says : ' to have any chance of life – at least life like our own – a free - floating @entity34 would need liquid water			1
' a planet needs to keep warm for liquid water to form , and without the sun , this heat would have to come from its interior			1
' a layer of ice on a planet 's surface can act as a strong insulator , locking in a planet 's heat , ' claims @entity24			2
globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make rogue more common than first thought			2
rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star @entity59 was detected 80 light years away from @entity34 and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of @entity63 several years ago , an international team of astronomers discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit			1
planets traditionally travel in a uniform , singular direction , around a star			0
however , the free - floating planet , named @entity59 , was found without a host			0
its movement is n't structured , and scientists do not understand how it formed and they are baffled by what - if anything - controls it			0
@entity59 was detected 80 light years away from @entity34 and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of @entity63			0
astronomers believe it formed 12 million years ago , and is considered a newborn in planetary terms - @entity34 is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old			2
dr @entity88 of the @entity89 at the @entity90 identified the rogue planet from its ' faint and unique heat signature '			2
we have never before seen an object free - floating in space that that looks like this			0
' it has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars , but it is drifting out there all alone , ' explained @entity88			2
' if the ice layer is thick enough , then a planet can maintain an ocean of liquid water beneath the ice			1
' he calculates that the ice layer needs to be at least 10 km ( 6 miles ) thick to prevent it from freezing for billions of years			2
@entity111 comments echo a similar conclusion reached by scientists in @entity114 several years ago			0
they calculated that life can cling on to a planet for billions of years without a star to provide a direct source of warmth			0
research by astrophysicists @entity123 and @entity124 from the city 's university discovered that heat would come from the breakdown of radioactive elements inside the planet 's core			0
the scientists named their discovery a ' @entity135 ' planet because they claimed any life found there would ' exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe '			0
however the pair refused to speculate on what life forms would be discovered , but agreed that they would me microscopic in size			0
as well as internal heat , @entity24 says another way a planet can keep warm is using a thick atmosphere			1
' a free - floating @entity34 with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could keep its surface temperature above the freezing point of water , ' writes @entity24			1
' the planet could have lakes and oceans ( and possibly life ) on its surface			0
' rogue planets are hard to find because , without orbiting a star , they reflect very little light			1
but 50 have now been found in the past 15 years , leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe			1
rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star			1
@entity168 dwarfs , for example , are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain fusion , but are still more than 13 times the mass of @entity63			0
the exact boundary between a giant planet and a low - mass brown dwarf is still being debated , but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery			1
and this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos .			1

comments were made by @entity24 , an astrophysicist in @entity26
he says internal heat of rogue planets could allow liquid water to form
writing in @entity30 , he also says a thick atmosphere may help life develop
astronomers have found 50 of these rogue planets in the past 15 years
