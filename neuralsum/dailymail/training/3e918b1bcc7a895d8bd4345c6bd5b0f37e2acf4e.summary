click here to read @entity2 's match report from the @entity3 on december 6 , @entity4 put in a battling performance for @entity6 away at @entity7			1
his @entity9 career looked to be over			1
but in the space of just 43 days the young @entity10 is seemingly irreplaceable in the @entity12 midfield after a masterclass in shielding his defence in the 2 - 0 victory at @entity16			1
such a display from the whole side has led to questions whether the penny has finally dropped with @entity21			0
and after years of trialling several players , he may have found a new midfield general			2
at just 23 years of age , his sense of leadership from the first whistle was evident on sunday			2
the fact that @entity53 and @entity54 were rarely called upon in @entity55 was testament to his performance			0
@entity4 won 100 per cent of his tackles , 7/8 of his aerial duels , made six interceptions , 11 clearances , and his passion and desire on the pitch went down a storm with the travelling supporters			1
while this was just his 13th @entity69 start , @entity4 is no stranger to the @entity9 shirt although he has often deputised at full back , something which makes his renaissance all the more surprising			1
the worry with the former @entity36 teen was never his ability to tackle or his tenacity , but his passing , positional sense and know - how			2
@entity4 is no stranger to the @entity9 shirt , here pictured in the 8 - 2 defeat by @entity82 in 2011 @entity21 watched his @entity9 side beat @entity16 2 - 0 at the @entity3 interceptions : 6 tackles : 3/3 aerial duels won : 7/8 clearances : 11 passing accuracy : 87 per cent however , he was cool in possession ( with an 87 per cent passing accuracy ) , always had an eye on @entity25 and showed his maturity after @entity94 opened the scoring in the first half			1
while his team - mates were celebrating by the corner flag , @entity4 can be seen instructing them to calm down , to keep their focus			1
it was only at the final whistle that he really started to celebrate , cupping his ear in front of the away fans to ramp up the noise			0
' i took him from @entity10 at the age of 16 , ' @entity21 said of his compatriot			0
' today he is 23			0
he has gone through some difficult periods but he 's a learner from his experiences			0
i 've always kept faith in him , because i told him three months ago that he needed to play somewhere			2
' he accepted to go down to @entity6 and had convincing performances			2
now he 's come back , i 've played him and he 's done very well			0
' @entity4 is pictured telling his team - mates to calm down while they celebrated @entity94 's opener @entity4 controlled the midfield area against @entity16 - click here to view more stats using our fantastic match zone service of course , the whole team should take credit for the performance , as should wenger			1
but have the performances of @entity4 been tactical genius or pure luck ? if all men were fit on sunday he surely would n't have started			1
struggling to make an impact on a season - long loan at @entity39 last season , his @entity9 career looked to be over despite failing to move away in the summer			1
another short - term deal followed in the @entity132 with @entity6 , more as a means of getting minutes under his belt than with a view to stepping up again with the first team			1
but with @entity137 and @entity138 struggling with form and fitness in north @entity141 , @entity21 placed his faith in @entity143			0
a battling performance at the @entity145 last month turned out to be his last performance for the @entity147 , he was booked in the 1 - 1 draw			0
@entity4 impressed in games against @entity150 and @entity151 , but against the champions he stood up to the toughest test			2
@entity4 had a 100 per cent tackle success on sunday , here competing against @entity155 @entity156 had insisted that @entity9 sign @entity157 , but after the game praised @entity4 his tale is similar to that of @entity157 , another man who impressed at @entity9 after a loan move at @entity162			1
new @entity163 pundit and @entity9 legend @entity156 was one urging @entity21 to bring back song , now at @entity166 , but even he could n't help but be impressed by @entity167			1
' i think that he can do the job			0
you just have to be disciplined , ' @entity156 said after the game			2
' if you 're a centre back and you have that protection , you have an easier game			0
' he can do it			0
it 's just up to them to show it every time now			0
' @entity138 , @entity137 , @entity157 , as well as @entity179 and @entity180 , have tried and failed to make the ' @entity183 ' role their own , but none stood up to the champions like the man from @entity187			0
transfer targets have fallen by the wayside			0
it 's now @entity4 's position to lose			2
@entity137 ( left ) and @entity138 ( right ) may struggle to get back in the team after @entity4 's displays			1

@entity9 beat @entity16 2 - 0 at the @entity3 on sunday
@entity4 starred in midfield , shackling @entity25
