the woman at the center of the @entity4 footballer rape scandal did not believe she had been assaulted at first because she was dating one of the four accused players , a new report has revealed			0
the female victim , who has not been identified , initially told police that she was romantically involved with one of the students and believed he would not have allowed anything bad to happen to her			1
she even admitted to having consensual sex with him in the days following the alleged sexual assault			1
it was not until she heard about the pictures and video of the three other players ' attacking her ' that she found out about the alleged assault			1
@entity21 is one of the four accused football players , and the young woman said that she met up with him at a local bar on the night of june 23			1
the alleged victim did not have any recollection of being raped , and only had her suspicion raised after hearing that there was a video and pictures of her being assaulted while unconscious			2
' ( the victim ) advised she had been drinking heavily and has very little / no memory of events that took place , ' the report stated			0
' advised she does not think she was sexually assaulted did not " feel " like she had sex			0
' she told police that she spoke with @entity21 with no contention after june 23 and had ' consensual sex with him within a few days following this incident '			1
it was only after speaking with a victim 's advocate at the police station that the young woman decided to submit herself for a rape kit			0
@entity63 ( left ) , @entity60 ( center ) and @entity62 ( right ) are the other players facing two counts each of aggravated sexual battery in connection to the june rape crime scene : police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second - floor room in the @entity75 dormitory , where he proceeded to rape her one of the key pieces of evidence backing the police 's charges is surveillance footage provided by the @entity4			1
the @entity39 reports that the footage shows three black men and one white man - whose identities were not explicitly stated by the school officials - are seen carrying a young woman wearing a short skirt			1
the skirt did not cover her throughout the video meaning that her ' private area was sometimes exposed '			1
that skirt and the other clothing she was wearing on the night of the attack are now being held by police and used as evidence			2
@entity100 previously revealed information about the night of the sex assault , during which @entity21 and three other players allegedly smashed through a security door before one of the suspects covered a surveillance camera in the hallway with a towel			2
several students later recalled hearing a loud bang that night , which turned out to be the sound of a door being knocked off the hinges in the second - floor hallway			0
the force with which the door was broken would eventually lead authorities to suspect that football players may have been involved			0
investigators working on the case believe that mr @entity21 brought his passed - out date to his room and had sex with her without consent , with three of his teammates present at one point or another in the course of the night			2
according to @entity100 sources , unnamed objects were also employed to sexually penetrate the unconscious student , and @entity21 used his cell phone to allegedly take graphic photos and record video , which he later sent to four people			2
earlier appearance : the alleged rape is believed to have taken place in @entity21 's room , and the victim did not think he would have allowed anything bad to happen to her ( @entity21 seen here on october 16 ) warning : @entity21 's new attorney @entity143 argues that the evidence is being exaggerated and his client is ' absolutely innocent ' it remains unclear whether the alleged rape victim remained in @entity21 â€™s room until the next morning , or whether she was carried to another room in the dormitory			1
@entity151 spoke out for the first time on november 25 , with his team of lawyers at his side			0
' i 'm innocent and i 'm going to fight that to the very end , ' the 20 - year - old transfer student said to @entity160			1
' it 's been extremely difficult for me			0
i came to play football and a great education			0
that would be the reason to come to @entity4 and that 's not what i got			0
' he was most recently seen at a hearing on tuesday before @entity170 where his new attorneys claimed he is ' absolutely innocent ' as the evidence against him has been ' exaggerated and completely oversold '			0
' i believe that when the truth comes out , people who rushed to judgment in this particular case are going to have regret , ' defense attorney @entity143 said according to @entity180 of @entity181 , @entity182			0
the other football players who face two counts of aggravated sexual battery are 19 - year - olds @entity63 , @entity60 and @entity62 .			1
