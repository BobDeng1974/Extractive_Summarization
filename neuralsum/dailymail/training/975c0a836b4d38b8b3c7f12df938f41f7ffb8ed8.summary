by @entity0 @entity1 has admitted that it 's latest console , the @entity4 , has flopped , causing serious problems for the company behind such iconic games franchises as @entity8 and the @entity9			1
the @entity11 video games maker had been counting on the new console to revive its fortunes amid cut - throat competition from @entity16 's new @entity15 and @entity18 's recently released @entity17			1
but despite the highest @entity21 spending on consoles for three years in the run up to @entity24 , the company has been forced to slash its sales forecast for its flagship device by 70 per cent			0
flop : @entity1 has announced that sales of its @entity4 tablet have been abysmal , forcing it to slash its sales forecast by 70 per cent and issue a warning of a ¥ 35billion ( $ 336 million ) operating loss in the year to march ' we failed to reach our target for hardware sales during the year - end , when revenues are the highest , ' the @entity33 - based company said in a statement			1
' as a result , the sale of high - margin software fell far short of our projections			0
' @entity1 now says it expects an operating loss of ¥ 35billion ( $ 336 million ) for the year to end - march , after poor sales of its @entity4 and @entity46 game machines during the crucial holiday season			1
the move reverses its previous forecast of a ¥ 100billion profit and would mark the third consecutive year of operating losses for the embattled company			2
the warning comes just three months after @entity1 stood by its sales projections for the @entity4 , and amid a general spring back in consumers ' demand for new video games consoles			1
sales of video games hardware in the @entity21 last december were up 28 per cent compared to the previous year , with shoppers taking him $ 1.37billion worth of the technology in the run up to @entity24 , @entity64 reports			0
' far short of our projections ' : @entity1 's president @entity66 holds up one of his company 's tablet - style @entity4 consoles ' the newest consoles from @entity16 and @entity18 are off to a tremendous start , ' said @entity74 analyst @entity73			1
' @entity15 led consoles sales in december , while @entity17 's two - month total makes it the best selling console during the two - month launch window			0
' the @entity4 's dismal sales are a major blow to @entity1 president @entity81 , who has repeatedly had to scale back sales projections for the console as it failed to emulate the success of its hugely popular predecessor , the @entity88			2
mr @entity66 told a briefing a year ago , when the company warned of its second consecutive year of operating losses , that he had ' made a commitment ' to achieve an operating profit of ¥ 100billion or more in the year to march 2014			2
' the fact that the ' @entity4 strategy ' has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell - off as soon as the market opens , ' said @entity98 , chief executive of @entity99			0
' the company appears to have failed to differentiate the @entity4 from the @entity88 , ' he said , adding that his own 10 - year - old son , who owns a @entity88 and @entity102 , had shown no interest in the @entity4 despite the surge in @entity21 sales of rivals ' machines , commentators are warning that the whole industry faces fierce competition from non-specialist hardware like smartphones and tablets boasting thousands of inexpensive games apps			1
ownership of such devices , dominated by @entity118 's @entity117 and @entity120 's @entity119 , has mushroomed in the past five years and shifted the gaming goalposts into consumers ' pockets			0
@entity1 on friday also warned of a net loss of ¥ 25billion for the year ending on march 31 , a substantial reversal from its prior projection of a ¥ 55billion profit			2
it now expects revenues of ¥ 590billion , down 36 per cent from its prior forecast			0
