by @entity0 published : 22:00 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 30 august 2013 the originator of the now - ubiquitous foam finger is disappointed at his creation being ' degraded ' by @entity5 in her controversial performance with @entity7 at the @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity9 , 59 , created the first finger back in 1971 when he was a 16 - year - old looking for a way to cheer on his school basketball team in the @entity14 state championships			1
@entity9 never imagined his homage to school sports would eventually find its way on - stage with a 20 - year - old pop - star clad in a skin - colored latex bikini doing unspeakable things to it			2
finger fiasco : the much - maligned performance by @entity5 and her foam finger @entity5 ' thrusting , grinding , twerking and inability to keep her tongue inside her head has been much - remarked since the performance but for @entity9 , it was particularly distasteful			1
' she took an honorable icon that is seen in sporting venues everywhere and degraded it			0
fortunately , the foam finger has been around long enough that it will survive this incident , ' @entity9 told @entity38			1
@entity5 ' antics aside , the foam finger first found fame when an @entity43 photographer took a picture of the teenaged @entity9 with a large hand with pointing finger that @entity38 reports he made from ' galvanized hardware cloth , paper mache , spray paint and a red marker over the course of a few days			1
' he was snapped at one of the two games he used the finger to cheer on his team - the state semifinal and the championship game in @entity59			2
family friendly : the photo taken by @entity43 and printed in the 1971 @entity63 yearbook of @entity9 and his creation @entity66 faux pas : the foam finger with brightly painted red fingernails was created by a stylist a year ago , but will now permanently reside with @entity5 , who took it home from the award show pointing the finger : the foam finger first made its appearance in @entity7 's music video for ' @entity76 ' infamy : @entity5 and her foam finger during the cringe - worthy spectacle ' it was pretty popular at the game , ' @entity9 told @entity38			1
' nobody had ever seen anything like that before , so it got some attention			0
and then when the team made its trip back to @entity89 from @entity59 , i recall being on the bus with the team , holding the finger out the window			2
' the finger : @entity9 's original homemade creation a few years later , the first foam fingers began making their appearance at sports games after @entity99 began selling them at the 1978 @entity101			1
@entity9 and @entity99 have never met , but @entity9 thinks it was his homemade finger that was the inspiration for the famous foam finger			1
' i do n’t have evidence of newspaper clippings from around the country , but i do recall people from other states saying that they had seen the picture , ' @entity9 said			0
as for the actual finger defiled by @entity113 , it was originally made by stylist @entity114 for a fashion shoot last year			0
it did n't make the cut but when styling the video for @entity7 's @entity119 lines , she decided to bring it along as a prop			0
it featured in the video and then went on to become part of @entity5 ' performance			2
and according to @entity128 , the pop star took it home with her without even buying it dinner first			0
as @entity5 furiously twerked and fondled @entity7 onstage , @entity9 was otherwise occupied			2
he only saw a clip of the performance after a family member showed him on @entity135			0
' for people that like that kind of entertainment , i ’m sure that it met their needs , ' @entity9 said			0
' if i had a choice between @entity144 singing @entity145 and @entity5 doing @entity146 , i ’d go the @entity144 route , ' he said .			0

@entity9 first used a homemade finger to cheer on his high school basketball team in 1971
he was not impressed by @entity5 ' use of the ' icon ' in her @entity155 performance
@entity5 *allegedly* took the foam finger home with her after the infamous performance
