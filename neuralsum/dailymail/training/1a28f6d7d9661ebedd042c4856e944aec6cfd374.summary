by @entity0 published : 03:25 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 13 august 2013 lounging on board a yacht and larking around in the pool of their upmarket resort , they look like any other young @entity7 on holiday			2
but you ’re paying for their fun			0
the swimsuit - clad partygoers relaxing in @entity14 are a film crew shooting the @entity17 ’s latest reality tv offering , which costs about £ 1million a series			1
viewers reacted angrily yesterday after it emerged that the 15 - strong team are staying at a five - star beachside hotel in the island of @entity24 at licence fee payers ’ expense while they film @entity27 show @entity28			1
but looking at the holiday snaps of the film crew sent to record them – which also show them downing rum cocktails – it seems there is little to distinguish the subjects of the programme from its makers			1
most of the crew are freelancers working for production company @entity73 , which is paid around £ 150,000 an episode for each seven - episode series			2
producer and director @entity31 posted a series of photos of the staff enjoying themselves in breaks between filming last month			0
relaxing : female members of the crew enjoy a spectacular @entity14 beach in this picture posted online idyllic : another crew member posted this picture of the view from their five - star hotel no worries : with nothing to do , the crew spent their time lounging on yachts and drinking in bars he wrote : ‘ not much to film at the mo , so spending time relaxing down the beach ! so yeah it ’s going well			1
’ next to another series of snaps of himself kayaking with another team member , he joked : ‘ it ’s a terrible job			0
’ it is thought the crew enjoyed a short break in filming because two participants who were due to be filmed for one episode pulled out at the last minute			0
the crew stayed at the smart @entity114 , where the cheapest rooms cost £ 185 a night			0
it boasts spectacular ocean views and rooms with private pools			0
yesterday some viewers called on the @entity17 to stop using licence fee payers ’ money to fund ‘ trashy programmes ’ which allow staff to enjoy luxurious trips abroad			1
writing on @entity127 , one said : ‘ all aboard the licence fee payer gravy train			0
disgusting behaviour , but you would not expect anything less from the once great @entity17 these days			1
’ another added : ‘ good old @entity17			1
happy to spend our money on having fun while simultaneously creating programmes designed to dumb down our nation ’s youth			0
’ a third said : ‘ i do n’t think the @entity17 should be wasting taxpayers ’ money on any of this tacky cheap television			1
’ luxury : the @entity114 in @entity24 where rooms start at £ 190 a night fun in the sun : the crew were left with an unexpected break when one of the documentary subjects pulled out the format of @entity28 – which was launched in 2011 to a panning from by critics – sees holidaymakers in their late teens and early twenties sent on to a foreign resort			1
although they know they are being filmed , they are not told until the end of the episode that their parents have also been at the resort and have watched their every move on video screens			0
yesterday a @entity17 spokesman denied reports that the two participants had cancelled after they realised the deception , saying instead that they had pulled out for ‘ personal reasons ’			1
he said : ‘ production schedules were amended due to a change of contributors but the production team continued to work and film other material for the series			1
‘ as with all productions , staff work very long hours , with the right to some time off			1
@entity73 followed all @entity17 guidelines while filming the series and it will deliver in full , and for the original @entity17 programme budget			1
’ the crew currently filming the next series will each take five days holiday out of the 34 days total filming time in @entity14			2
although they paid for all private expenses incurred in their own time , they have each been given a £ 25 daily allowance to cover day - to - day expenses while they are working			2
reward for failure : the @entity17 gave former director general @entity194 a £ 475,000 payoff the @entity17 has repeatedly been exposed for wasting licence fee payers ' money on doomed projects and expensive pay offs			2
in may , the corporation admitted it had blown £ 100million on a failed it , the @entity202			0
first billed five years ago as ' the single most important initiative we are working on ' , the scheme was meant to save money by allowing all production staff access to video and audio material			0
but costs spiralled , the project ran 21 months behind schedule and it was eventually halted in april this year			0
former director general @entity194 walked away from his job with £ 475,000 after being sacked following a calamitous 54 days in charge			0
and the @entity215 revealed the @entity17 handed its own staff £ 369million in severance payments over eight years			1
mps said the massive sum showed an ‘ outrageous disregard for licence - fee payers ’ money ’			0
the @entity215 said the @entity17 often breached its own guidelines and had ‘ put public trust at risk ’ by authorising the payouts , including £ 61million to senior managers			2
three internal reviews set up in the wake of the @entity231 scandal have already cost £ 5million			0
and despite spending £ 1billion revamping @entity232 in central @entity233 , the @entity17 will spend £ 3million a year renting back @entity234 which was closed in march .			2

documentary team post pictures of booze - filled jaunt in five - star hotel
were in @entity24 to film @entity27 show @entity28 , @entity240 and *suspicious* parents
but they were left with nothing to do when one of the subjects pulled out
