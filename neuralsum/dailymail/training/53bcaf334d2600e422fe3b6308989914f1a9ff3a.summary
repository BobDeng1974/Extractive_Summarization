by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 22 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:16 est , 22 february 2014 @entity3 has said his @entity5 space flights can not afford to lose anyone aboard when the crafts eventually blast off for the first time sir @entity3 has said he can not afford to lose anyone aboard his commercial space flight venture @entity5 when the operation eventually blasts off for the first time			1
the entrepreneur said the flight - which aims to reach 62 miles above earth and include around five minutes of weightlessness - does pose safety risks to those aboard			1
he added @entity17 have lost three per cent of people they have put in to space - and that re-entry towards earth had posed the biggest problems for astronauts			1
however , sir @entity3 said he still planned to take his children up on the first flight - which the multimillionaire hopes will take off in autumn			1
in an interview with @entity29 , he said : ' everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space programme and understands the risks that go with that			0
' the biggest worry i had was re-entry			0
@entity17 has lost about 3 per cent of everyone who 's gone into space , and re-entry has been their biggest problem			1
' for a government - owned company , you can just about get away with losing 3 per cent of your clients			2
for a private company you ca n't really lose anybody			1
' @entity5 was founded in 2004 , shortly after the creation of the first reusable spacecraft for private use - the @entity51 - which was designed by retired aerospace engineer @entity52			1
along with funding from @entity55 , a @entity56 billionaire , the engineer won a $ 10m grant to create a reusable craft for the first private space flight			2
@entity60 was the first private spaceship to complete a series of high - altitude flights in 2004			0
@entity65 's @entity64 is a larger version of the @entity60 - and can accommodate six people plus two pilots			0
along with the flight , those aboard will experience about five minutes of weightlessness as part of the package			2
so far , three test flights of the @entity83 have only managed altitude of around 71,000ft - approximately 13 miles			0
in order to receive the necessary @entity93 licence , the craft needs to complete test missions at full speed and 62 - mile height			0
critics say the engine in mr @entity3 's craft will need redesigning before it is capable of getting to the required altitude - making an autumn flight unlikely			1
@entity65 biographer @entity102 told the newspaper : ' for the last 10 years he 'd been trying to make it work and it just is n't working			0
where 's the evidence he can make it work in the next six months ? ' the craft on a test flight			0
so far , it has only managed to reach an altitude of 13 miles - well below @entity3 's aims for it to reach 62 miles above earth			2

sir @entity3 says his @entity5 spacecraft poses safety *challenges*
says he ' ca n't lose anyone ' aboard flight - *due* to first take off in autumn
added @entity17 have lost 3 *%* of those they *'ve* sent into space
