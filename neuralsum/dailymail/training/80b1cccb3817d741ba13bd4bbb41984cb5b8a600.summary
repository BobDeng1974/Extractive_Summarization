a high - flying executive avoided paying almost £ 43,000 in train tickets for his daily commute into @entity3 - and paid back the dodged fares in just three days after being caught			1
over five years , the hedge fund manager dodged the £ 24.50 - each - way fare while travelling from his home in the sought - after village of @entity9 , @entity10 to his place of work in the city			1
the unnamed man , who is believed to be the biggest fare dodger in history , exploited a loophole that allowed him to pay only a third of the actual cost of his 1hour 22minute journey			0
rural : the hedge fund manager , who dodged £ 43,000 in rail fares over five years , began his journey into @entity3 at @entity9 train station in @entity10 , which has no ticket barriers he caught the commuter train from @entity9 - a rural station with no barriers or ticket machine and only a part - time ticket office - without purchasing a fare			1
once in @entity3 , the executive was then able to pass through the barriers at @entity35 by simply ' tapping out ' with an @entity36 paying just £ 7.20			1
but his scam was finally exposed by a ticket inspector and , in an out - of - court settlement , he paid @entity41 trains back the £ 42,550 in dodged fares and £ 450 legal cost within three days			1
the cost of a standard - class single fare from @entity9 - where the average home cost half a million pounds - to @entity3 is £ 24.50 while an annual season ticket costs £ 4,548			1
according to a report in the @entity50 , the senior executive is believed to have travelled into @entity3 without buying any ticket and avoiding detection from 2008 until the end of last year			2
free pass : he would arrive at @entity57 station and transfer to another platform , for a service to @entity35 , while avoiding the barriers he was able to get off his train at @entity57 and cross a platform to catch a service to @entity35 - again avoiding having to go through any barriers			1
at @entity35 , he used an oyster card to exit the barriers , paying the then maximum £ 7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having tapped in			2
but on november 25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he had paid £ 7.20 and not the £ 2.30 for a single ticket			2
after being challenged , the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct fare on five journeys between @entity57 and @entity35			2
however , suspicious investigators for @entity41 discovered that the man had for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket from @entity9			2
final destination : he would reach @entity35 in @entity3 , only paying £ 7.20 - a third of the rail fare and within five days of being caught out at @entity35 , the executive renewed his season ticket , leading @entity41 to believe he had been dodging the fare for his commute for five years			1
despite never admitting to this , the executive offered to settle the matter out of court and paid up within three days of being notified by the train operator the total owed in dodged tickets			0
@entity41 , who has not named the man , said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court			0
the train company told the @entity50 that the executive wanted to protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would have on his job			0
cheating the system : the unnamed commuter would only ' tap out ' his oyster card once on his journey a spokesperson added : ' all customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him			0
' the customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process			0
' however , crtiics have questioned why the fare dodging executive was allowed to escape being prosecuted and remain anonymous			0
@entity121 , leader of the @entity123 rail union , said in the report : ' it is not only extraordinary that the biggest fare dodger in railway history got away with it for so long , but has also now escaped criminal prosecution as well			0
' do you know the fare dodger ? contact the @entity133 news desk at editorial@mailonline.co.uk			0

each day , commuter avoided £ 49 fare from @entity9 , @entity10
travelled to @entity3 , would ' tap out ' @entity36 once and only be charged £ 7.20
he would get off at @entity57 and catch service @entity35
however his scam was exposed and he paid the bill in a settlement
an annual ticket would have cost £ 4,548 , or £ *22,740* over five years
he was instead charged the full daily fare totalling £ 42,550 - plus legal costs
