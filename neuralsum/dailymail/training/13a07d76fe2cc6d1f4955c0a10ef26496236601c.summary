@entity1 's internet connection has been cut for the second day in a row today , says a @entity4 internet research group tracking the country 's connectivity			1
according to @entity10 , @entity1 's four networks supplied by the @entity9 company @entity8 were offline at 1541 gmt on tuesday , reports @entity11			2
@entity1 also lost internet connection for more than nine hours on monday leading some to believe the @entity4 might be behind a cyber-attack in retaliation for the hack of @entity16			1
lost internet : @entity1 's and leader @entity19 's ( pictured ) internet connection has been cut for the second day in a row today , says a @entity4 internet research group tracking the country 's connectivity @entity1 , led by @entity19 ( right ) , suffered one of its worst ever internet outages just days after @entity4 president @entity25 ( left ) warned of a ' proportional response ' to the @entity16 hacking @entity4 @entity28 have blamed @entity1 for the @entity16 hack and president @entity25 promised a ' proportionate response ' to the alleged hack of the @entity34 film company			1
the @entity4 has not come forward about the @entity1 internet outage but online experts say that it resembles a ' denial of service ' attack			1
the @entity39 suggested on monday that @entity4 may be behind the virtual attack on @entity1 yesterday			1
very few people in the country have access to the internet , with connections often failing			0
however , the continuous problems reportedly being experienced led experts to raise the possibility that it might be under a cyber attack			1
deputy @entity39 spokeswoman @entity50 reminded a reporter on monday of @entity25 's threat to take action against @entity1 while responding to a general question about the possibility that the country was undergoing a cyber assault a spokesperson for @entity39 lent credence to the theory on monday when she reminded a reporter of @entity25 's threat while responding to a general question about the possibility that @entity1 was undergoing a cyber assault			2
' as the president said , we are considering a range of options in response , ' deputy spokeswoman @entity50 said			0
' we are n’t going to discuss , publicly , operational details about the possible response options — or comment on those types of reports in any way — except to say that as we implement those responses some will be seen , some may not be seen			0
' she added , ' so i ca n’t confirm those reports , but in general , that ’s what the president has spoken to			0
' for nine hours on monday , the hermit regime went completely offline			0
' it 's as if @entity1 got erased from the global map of the @entity89 , ' @entity85 , president of internet security company @entity86 , told @entity90			2
the outage followed president @entity25 's public shaming of @entity1 on friday after the @entity4 government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at @entity16 over the studio 's new film , @entity97 , which depicts the assassination of @entity1 leader @entity19			1
@entity101 , director of internet analysis at @entity103 , said the internet connectivity problems were discovered in the last 24 hours and had gotten progressively worse to the point that ' @entity1 's totally down			1
' internet connection was restored after nine hours on monday but on @entity101 said one benign explanation for the problem might be that a router suffered a software glitch , though a cyber-attack involving @entity1 's internet service was also a possibility			1
' i have n't seen such a steady beat of routing instability and outages in @entity118 before , ' he told @entity119 ' usually there are isolated blips , not continuous connectivity problems			1
i would n't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack presently			0
' the outage comes just days after president @entity25 's public shaming of @entity1 after the @entity4 government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at @entity16 although very few citizens in @entity1 have access to the internet , it allows the country 's state media to link to the outside world			1
the communist state 's internet access is wired through @entity9 , which today , in a foreign ministry statement , said it ' opposes cyber attacks and cyber terrorism in all of its forms , ' without referring directly to its ally @entity1			1
the instability is in @entity1 's main link , which runs through the northern @entity9 city of @entity154			0
@entity101 said this applied to @entity1 's main internet connection via @entity9 company @entity157 , although it was possible the country had limited connection via satellite			2
' all i can say is that in the last 24 hours , their communications have been degraded to a point where they are unable to communicate , ' he said			0
' they have disappeared from the global @entity89 presently			0
' @entity103 monitors internet performance though live feeds of router tables from about 450 telecommunications providers worldwide			0
@entity101 said @entity1 's internet connection has historically been stable , although it has come under attack in the past , including during a period of high tension with @entity175 in 2013			1
he said there were a lot of players - including potentially teenage hackers - who could mount a ' distributed denial - of - service ' cyber attack on @entity1 , if this were the cause of the outages			1
' it does n't need to be some big nation state , ' he added			0
another internet technology service , @entity186 , which protects companies against hacker attacks , said its monitoring had detected denial - of - service attacks aimed at @entity1 's infrastructure , which started on saturday and continued into today			1
such attacks transmit so much spurious data traffic to internet equipment that it becomes overwhelmed , until the attacks stop or the spurious traffic can be filtered and discarded to allow normal connections to resume			0
@entity198 has accused @entity199 of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused @entity16 executives to halt the debut of the comedy action film ' @entity97 ' it is not immediately clear if the connectivity problems were an act of retribution for the hack that the @entity211 last week linked to @entity1			1
distributed denial - of - service attacks are a relatively unsophisticated type of cyber warfare , in which a targeted computer system is bombarded with traffic , rendering it temporarily useless			2
asked about the internet problems , @entity1 diplomat @entity219 , said : ' i have no information			1
' @entity198 has accused @entity199 of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused @entity16 executives to halt the debut of the @entity97			0
according to the @entity211 , there is ' significant overlap ' between the @entity16 attack and other ' malicious cyber-activity ' with direct links to @entity199 , including an attack last year on @entity175 banks blamed on the @entity1			2
the hackers behind the attack on @entity16 said they were incensed by the comedy , and the studio pulled the film from distribution after major @entity4 cinema chains declined to exhibit it			2
the film about a fictional @entity243 plot to kill the country 's leader infuriated @entity1 , although @entity199 has repeatedly denied it was behind the cyber assault			2
despite calls from @entity249 critics for a robust response to the alleged hack , @entity25 told @entity90 in an interview that aired on sunday : ' i do n't think it was an act of war			0
i think it was an act of cyber vandalism that was very costly , very expensive			0
we take it very seriously			0
' he also promised to ' review ' the @entity4 list of state sponsors of terrorism and potentially re-add @entity1 , but added : ' we 've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism			2
and we do n't make those judgments just based on the news of the day			0
' the @entity270 declined to comment today and @entity50 refused to confirm or deny that @entity1 had lost internet access because of a cyber attack			1
@entity1 has threatened to hit back at the @entity270 and other @entity4 targets if it was sanctioned over the alleged hacking			2
today @entity50 said of those threats : ' we have no specific credible threat information that leads credence to these reports			0
' ' obviously , we take very seriously any threats to @entity4 citizens , to @entity4 companies , regardless of what that threat looks like			0
' @entity1 's @entity286 , in a statement on the official news agency , said the country 's army and people ' are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the @entity4 in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels			1
' meanwhile , @entity175 's @entity294 ( @entity295 ) began conducting drills at its four nuclear plant complexes today after a series of online information leaks by a suspected hacker			0
the hacker , using an account entitled ' president of the anti-nuclear reactor group ' , published a variety of information on @entity307 , including designs and manuals for two reactors as well as personal information on some 10,000 @entity295 employees			0
there did not appear to be any link between the drill and the @entity16 hack , and @entity1 says it has never attempted or made a cyber attack on @entity175 .			1

continuous problems today and for nine hours yesterday yesterday could mean @entity1 was under cyber attack
*cybersecurity* expert says normal internet failings are ' isolated blips '
*unclear* if the connectivity problems were an act of retribution for hack
the @entity4 has not come forward about the @entity1 internet outage but online experts say that it resembles a ' denial of service ' attack
