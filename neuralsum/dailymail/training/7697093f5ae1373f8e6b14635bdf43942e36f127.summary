by @entity0 created 12:30 pm on 3rd september 2011 updated : 07:07 est , 8 march 2012 campaigner : @entity3 founder @entity2 has long been keen to publish the unedited cache of @entity6 cables campaigning website @entity3 has published its full cache of over 250,000 @entity6 diplomatic cables			1
unlike previous releases , sensitive information has not been redacted from the cables			0
the newspapers which previously worked with @entity3 have criticised the publication , saying it could endanger whistleblowers and dissidents in oppressive regimes			0
but the website 's founder @entity2 has been adamant since last year that ' the cables must eventually be made public ' , according one of his former employees			2
@entity24 journalist @entity23 , who worked at @entity3 for two months from november , also claims that mr @entity2 tried to use money donated to @entity3 to pay for his defence against sexual assault allegations in @entity28			1
mr @entity2 denies this claim			1
selected diplomatic cables were first released in december 2010 , with information such as the names of sources deleted			0
the cables were published by @entity3 and five newspapers from around the world : the @entity37 , the @entity24 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			0
all five have now issued a joint statement condemning the release of unedited cables , saying they ' deplore the decision ' and that it ' may put sources at risk '			0
they continue : ' we can not defend the needless publication of the complete data - indeed , we are united in condemning it			0
the decision to publish by @entity2 was his , and his alone			0
' the newly published collection of 251,287 cables contains over 1,000 messages which identify overseas activists , and around 150 identifying whistleblowers			0
a danger to whistleblowers ? the diplomatic cables previously had sensitive information redacted @entity3 blames a @entity24 journalist for its decision to release the uncensored cache			2
in his book on @entity3 , @entity64 published a password which he was given by mr @entity2 to access the data			1
he claims not to have known that the password was still valid for the file containing the unedited cables , which has been available on file - sharing websites since mr @entity2 's arrest last december			1
@entity3 now says the availability of the cables has forced it to release them in a searchable and easily accessible format			2
however , former @entity3 employee @entity23 claims that the website 's eccentric boss had long planned to release the uncensored data			1
mr @entity23 wrote in the @entity24 today that in a discussion over whether or not to publish all the cables , mr @entity2 was adamant that they should eventually do so , ' one way or another '			2
that claim appears to be supported by a written record of the discussion seen by @entity86 , which describes a heated argument over the cables ' release , with mr @entity2 ' insistent all cables must somehow be eventually released			1
' following the potentially endangering release , mr @entity23 has argued that ' @entity3 has done the cause of internet freedom - and whistleblowers - more harm than @entity6 government crackdowns ever could			2
' in a further blow to the campaigning mr @entity2 , mr @entity23 has claimed that mr @entity2 ' attempted to access @entity3 funds received through donations ' to fund his defence against allegations that he sexually assaulted two women in @entity28 last year			1
he is currently on bail as he fights extradition from @entity105 , having paid for his defence with help from celebrity supporters .			0

@entity2 planned to release full cache all along , according to a former employee
