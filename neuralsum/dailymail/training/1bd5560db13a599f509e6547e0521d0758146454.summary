a top technology guru at the @entity1 told @entity2 on tuesday that the government is nowhere near ready to close the deal on new @entity6 signups , with just ' 60 to 70 per cent ' of the website 's internal engine built so far			1
@entity1 has promised that the website will be full functional by november 30 , although @entity11 press secretary @entity10 said monday that the @entity13 administration would consider the effort successful if four out of five consumers could successfully enroll in insurance plans			0
testimony from @entity18 , the deputy chief information officer at @entity1 's @entity19 , indicates that this is because the government 's tech gurus still ca n't process payments			1
under questioning by @entity30 @entity29 rep. @entity29 , he said more than half of the tech systems that operate behind the scenes when consumers shop for insurance at healthcare.gov still are n't completed			2
' how much do we have to build today , still ? ' @entity29 asked			0
' i mean , what do we need to build ? 50 per cent ? 40 per cent ? 30 per cent ? ' ' i think it 's – uh , just an approximation , ' @entity18 answered , ' we 're probably sitting somewhere about 60 and 70 percent			0
' ' unbelievable ' : @entity29 was incredulous to learn how much of the @entity6 system still lacks the computer support to process payments and keep the books an incredulous @entity29 asked him to confirm that the ' 60 to 70 per cent ' number represented the incomplete sections of the website			1
@entity18 did n't dispute the number , but the @entity1 did later in the day , telling @entity60 that the numbers were reversed			2
@entity18 also clarified that the consumer portion – what @entity63 see when they visit the website – is ' 100 per cent there			0
' those functions include the capacity for consumers to complete a basic enrollment in the @entity6 system , compare health care plans and determine their eligibility for government subsidies			0
but ' the back office systems , the accounting systems [ and ] the payment systems , ' he conceded , are not ready for prime time			1
those systems include one that makes government subsidy payments directly to insurance companies on behalf of consumers who qualify			1
when the federal government released statistics on november 13 showing the number of @entity63 who had selected health insurance plans through healthcare.gov , it omitted any mention of how many had made actual purchases .			0

accounting and other ' back office ' systems are nowhere near ready , said a top @entity1 tech guru
a *congressional* panel heard that the government lacks the *ability* to process payments or pass the money on to insurance companies
@entity1 released @entity6 signup numbers but did n't say how many *people* made policy payments – because they ca n't process them
