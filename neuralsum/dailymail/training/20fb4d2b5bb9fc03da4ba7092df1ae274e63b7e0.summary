when @entity0 waved goodbye to arguably their three best defenders in the summer , no - one would have predicted them becoming the clean sheet kings of the @entity3 by december			1
yet the @entity0 go into monday night ’s match against @entity5 boasting the best defensive record in the @entity8 top flight			1
lose @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 ? no problem , at least not so far , for @entity13 ’s team			1
@entity15 has been in fine form for @entity0 this season under new boss @entity13 @entity0 goalkeeper @entity18 has proven himself to be one of the best goalkeepers in the @entity3 @entity20 ( centre ) and @entity22 ( right ) have helped the @entity0 to seven @entity3 clean sheets fewest goals conceded in the top - flight this season ( top five ) : @entity0 - 10 goals @entity29 - 13 goals @entity30 - 14 goals @entity5 - 16 goals @entity33 - 17 goals @entity0 have conceded a measly 10 @entity3 goals , thanks to a back four who have barely changed all season			1
add the giant goalkeeping presence of @entity18 , plus pass - breaker @entity22 in front of the defence , and that is one formidable hurdle			0
@entity15 , @entity20 and @entity45 have been ever - presents while @entity46 has played 10 matches			2
@entity46 is struggling to make the @entity5 game , which means a possible call for @entity51 , who has not let anyone down either			1
@entity53 , @entity54 and / or @entity55 may think that @entity0 ’s three - match run without a win means there might be easy pickings at @entity61 ’ s. not if @entity0 can help it			1
he has been part of the fixtures and fittings for a few years now and at the age of 30 provides a steady head for the younger players			0
the @entity70 reads the game and marshals his team - mates			0
@entity29 loanee @entity45 shows his pace down the flank against @entity77 midfielder @entity76 @entity46 is a doubt for @entity0 's clash with @entity5 after picking up an injury against @entity77 @entity15 might have been forgiven for wondering what he had done wrong in the summer as @entity82 and @entity9 headed off to @entity77 and @entity5			1
nothing at all , from @entity85 ’s point of view			0
@entity15 , 23 , is in the @entity88 coach ’s plans thanks to his club performances			0
he has also chipped in with three goals , which is an unexpected and pleasant bonus			2
@entity45 must love living out of a suitcase			0
the left back , on loan from @entity29 , is on his seventh temporary move and appears to find the south coast to his liking			0
the 25 - year - old had the misfortune of being at @entity99 while a certain @entity100 was monopolising his position			0
no - one doubted @entity45 ’s potential but he is finally getting the opportunity to prove himself a headline act			0
so to @entity46 , who is living up to his classy cv			0
the 25 - year - old @entity106 , brought up the @entity108 way , has played in the @entity110 final ( for @entity111 ) and the @entity112 in 2014 , which makes the @entity3 a less - daunting proposition			2
he is on loan from @entity115 doubtful for the @entity5 game with a thigh injury , which opens the door to @entity51			2
the @entity120 defender made 13 appearances last season and this year has started four games in the @entity3			1
@entity51 , 26 , may be an understudy but he knows what makes @entity0 tick after joining from @entity126 two years ago			2
@entity0 boss @entity13 has hinted that he may promote a couple of his youngsters to the bench , too			1
defender @entity131 will be hoping that he gets a close - up view of the seniors			0
the others in contention are midfielder @entity136 and striker @entity137 as @entity0 continue to show their production line is still working at full pelt			2
the @entity0 said goodbye to @entity9 in the summer following his £ 27million move to @entity5 @entity11 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) also left @entity61 's for @entity77 and @entity141 respectively			1

@entity5 face @entity143 at @entity144 on monday night
saints lost @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 in the summer
@entity0 have kept seven @entity3 clean sheets this season
@entity13 's side have also conceded just 10 league goals this term
