by @entity0 hospital bosses had to declare an ‘ internal emergency ’ and turn away ambulances from a packed @entity4 unit – weeks after they closed a nearby emergency department			1
doctors at @entity8 in @entity9 had to shut their doors to ambulance patients on january 31 this year – only to do the same thing again just two days later			1
according to a leaked letter , ‘ capacity issues ’ in the hospital ’s @entity4 forced ambulances to be sent elsewhere			1
struggle : doctors at @entity8 were forced to declare an ' internal emergency ' shutting their doors to ambulances after being swamped by patients the two incidents follow the controversial closure last december of @entity23 ’s @entity4 six miles away , which has heaped pressure on nearby hospitals			1
last night , a spokesman for @entity8 and @entity27 denied the diversions were caused by the @entity4 downgrade , adding : ‘ @entity30 experienced high numbers of attendances and ambulance arrivals to @entity4 on 31 january			1
‘ as a consequence of this , and in line with @entity38 policy , @entity8 declared an internal emergency and ... non-urgent ambulances were diverted			2
’ she added that diverts , as they are known , were not unusual and that there were 19 in total across @entity38 that weekend			2
but angry campaigners claim the @entity4 closure is ‘ putting lives at risk ’ , while local mp @entity50 said that hospital managers had serious questions to answer			1
dozens of @entity54 across the country are under threat , as the @entity57 and some doctors argue that the @entity38 can not afford to have an emergency unit in every hospital			0
critics have warned of the knock - on effects of the closures , which can force seriously ill patients to travel further to receive treatment – and then face more delays once they get there			1
downgrade : @entity23 's @entity4 was controversially closed			1
it is six miles from @entity8 , heaping pressure on the @entity9 trust 's emergency department paramedics say the @entity74 closure has led to a dramatic increase in ‘ stacking ’ at @entity9 hospitals , where ambulances have to queue to drop off patients			1
‘ i have always said the downgrade was the wrong decision , because the demands of the local population would lead to problems at other a&es			0
official @entity38 statistics bear this out , showing the number of ambulances waiting for more than 30 minutes outside one hospital has risen seven-fold			0
last week , @entity38 chief executive sir @entity91 said that ‘ centralised , large units ... work best ’ and warned that the @entity38 could not afford to keep smaller departments open			0
but @entity95 , of the @entity23 campaign group , said : ‘ this has become a very dangerous situation where there are not sufficient front - line services to deal with demand			2
it ’s putting lives at risk			2
there needs to be some serious and honest discussions with the decision makers , who need to admit there is a lack of services			0
’ last month , this newspaper revealed how two - year old @entity113 died after his desperate mother took him to @entity74 at 3am – only to discover that its @entity4 department had recently been closed down			1
two weeks later managers declared an ‘ internal major incident due to capacity issues in emergency ’ at @entity8 with ‘ ambulances queuing ’ , according to a letter to gps			2
@entity123 was asked ‘ to ensure that alternative hospitals are utilised ’ and gps were told not to send in patients ‘ where possible ’			0
stacking : the closure of @entity23 's @entity4 has also heaped pressure on @entity131 , where 34 extra ambulances have flocked to the trust every day since the closure the crisis in @entity8 ’s @entity4 on january 31 was triggered by there being ‘ no beds available ’ for admitted patients to move into , wrote @entity139 , associate director of @entity140 and @entity141			1
two days later a similar thing happened and ambulances had to be sent elsewhere			2
last winter , when @entity4 was still open , ambulances never had to be diverted from either hospital			2
@entity38 statistics also show that since @entity4 closed on december 9 , ambulances have had to wait outside @entity8 for more than 30 minutes on 236 occasions			1
over the same two - month period last winter , that happened only 167 times – and then the figures related to ambulances outside both hospitals , not just @entity8			1
however , the increase in stacking outside @entity155 has been far more startling			0
since @entity4 closed , ambulances have had to wait over 30 minutes on 941 separate occasions – or 14 times a day			1
during the same two - month period last winter , this only happened 132 times – or twice a day			0
dangerous situation : @entity50 , @entity162 mp for @entity163 , said : ' before @entity4 closed we were repeatedly told that capacity at @entity8 would not be an issue			1
these early indications suggest that clearly they can not			0
i have always said the downgrade was the wrong decision ' @entity131 board minutes show concern over the issue with the hospital receiving 34 extra ambulances a day since the closure , ‘ compared to an expectation of 29 ’			1
this has led to ‘ some clustering of ambulances which has caused some pressures on the flow of patients in to and through hospital ’ , wrote director @entity179			2
ambulance crews are meant to hand over patients within 15 minutes of arriving but performance on this is ‘ significantly below target ’			0
a @entity131 spokesman said that , as a result of the changes that included the @entity74 downgrade , it was expected the hospital would see an extra 26,000 patients a year			1
@entity50 , @entity162 mp for @entity163 , said : ‘ before @entity4 closed we were repeatedly told that capacity at @entity8 would not be an issue and they would be able to cope			1
these early indications suggest that clearly they can not			0
‘ i have always said the downgrade was the wrong decision , because the demands of the local population would lead to problems at other a&es			0
‘ when you have got ambulances stacking up outside the doors of @entity209 to that extent , it does beg the question : why are we downgrading other emergency departments ? ’ two - thirds of the public oppose plans for a new @entity38 database that will see details from confidential medical records being sold to companies , a poll has found			2
within weeks , gps will be forced to hand over medical records , including sensitive information such as mental health diagnoses , to build the database			0
last month it emerged that four in ten doctors intended to opt their own records out of the care.data project			0
now an online poll of 1,161 adults by @entity230 has found widespread opposition among the public			0
when asked if they would ‘ support or oppose ’ proposals to allow firms to access the database in exchange for a fee , 65 per cent said they were against the idea			0
@entity243 dr @entity242 said : ‘ the government needs to explain who is going to get access to this data , for what purpose and for how much			0
’ @entity249 , of pressure group @entity250 , which commissioned the poll , said : ‘ the consequences for ordinary people could be huge			0
