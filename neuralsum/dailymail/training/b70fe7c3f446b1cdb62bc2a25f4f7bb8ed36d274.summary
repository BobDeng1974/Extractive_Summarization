@entity0 's year began in imperious style and they claimed 11 straight wins from february to april			1
@entity6 ' side headed into may top of the pile and , although coming second in the @entity9 denoted a fine season , the way the title was lost in april and may provided a bitter blow for the club and supporters			2
@entity14 departed for @entity15 in the summer and the club have floundered since , crashing out of the @entity16 at the group stages and hobbling along at home			2
@entity19 reviews the year for @entity0			0
@entity14 waves to the @entity22 crowd following his final match for @entity0 after they finished second january january was all about bouncing back after two defeats in three days in late december by @entity26 and @entity27 saw @entity0 fall from first at @entity29 to fifth by @entity30			1
a 2 - 0 win over @entity32 at @entity22 kicked off 2014 on the right note before the @entity34 ( @entity14 and @entity35 ) put on a master - class in a 5 - 3 win at @entity38			1
@entity0 were fortunate to earn a point against @entity40 at @entity22 , fighting back from 2 - 0 down having been played off the park in the first half to draw 2 - 2			1
but the month ended perfectly with a 4 - 0 win over @entity44 in the @entity46 derby			2
@entity14 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) celebrate during @entity0 's 4 - 0 win over @entity44 at @entity22 february @entity50 ’s gaffe at @entity51 gifted @entity52 a point and saw @entity0 fall eight points behind leaders @entity56			1
but they responded by blowing the @entity57 off the pitch with a 5 - 1 victory at @entity22			0
the opening 20 minutes was as good a football as @entity0 played all season			0
that victory proved to be the start of an 11 - game winning streak that took the @entity65 to the brink of the @entity9 title			1
a 3 - 2 win away at @entity69 thanks to a late @entity71 penalty and a 4 - 3 win over @entity73 at @entity22 made it 10 points from 12 in february			0
@entity50 ( right ) reacts after his mistake against @entity52 cost @entity0 a win at the @entity51 @entity71 ( second right ) celebrates after scoring a late penalty as @entity0 beat @entity69 3 - 2 @entity80 march was the month that made @entity0 fans really believe it could be their year			2
@entity6 ’ side notched up five straight league wins , starting the month with a 3 - 0 victory at @entity87			1
the 3 - 0 win at @entity89 that followed will live long in the memory and it could have been an even wider margin of victory , such was @entity0 ’s dominance			1
@entity14 ’s hat - trick then led the @entity65 to a 6 - 3 win at @entity95 , before a nervy evening at @entity22 and a 2 - 1 win over @entity97 followed			1
a 4 - 0 drubbing of @entity99 moved @entity0 to the top of the table at the end of the month , setting up two huge clashes in april against @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity71 slots home one of his two penalties in the 3 - 0 win over @entity107 at @entity89 @entity6 ( second right ) congratulates his players as his team won five straight games in march @entity112 @entity71 ’s two penalties helped @entity0 overcome a tricky tie at @entity115 before the visit of @entity26 to @entity22			1
it proved to be a memorable afternoon , with @entity118 and @entity119 giving the @entity65 a 2 - 0 lead before @entity121 and a @entity123 own - goal dragged them back			1
@entity125 struck the winner , though , in a 3 - 2 win as @entity0 took a huge step towards the title			2
a 3 - 2 win at @entity131 followed , and then @entity27 came to @entity22 in what looked like the last hurdle @entity0 needed to overcome			1
it proved to be the day the title was lost , with @entity71 ’s costly slip letting in @entity136 to score the opening goal in a 2 - 0 win for a weakened visiting team			1
@entity0 ’s title destiny was out of their own hands			0
@entity125 jumps for joy after scoring @entity0 's winner against @entity26 @entity71 ( left ) slips and loses possession for @entity0 , gifting a goal to @entity136 ( right ) of @entity27 @entity71 's ( right ) error contributed to @entity0 losing the @entity9 title after a 2 - 0 loss to @entity27 may @entity0 ’s title challenge ended on a frantic monday night in south @entity151			1
@entity26 were already in the driving seat in the title race , but @entity6 ' men could ’ve kept the pressure on by winning their last two games			0
they looked well on course at @entity158 in going 3 - 0 up against @entity159 only to crumble in the closing stages and let @entity159 in to draw the game 3 - 3			2
it was @entity0 's ' @entity164 ' moment and @entity14 ’s tears on the pitch were the image of the night			2
he knew his chance to win the @entity9 had gone			0
a 2 - 1 win at @entity170 on the final day was n’t enough to prevent @entity26 from being crowned champions			2
it was a season that promised so much and ultimately delivered very little			0
@entity0 came agonisingly close to ending their 24 - year wait to win the title			0
@entity14 ( left ) is consoled by @entity71 ( right ) after crying following @entity0 's 3 - 3 draw with @entity159 @entity71 ( second left ) leads a subdued lap of honour after the game with @entity170 as @entity0 came second june arguably one of the most significant moments of @entity0 's year happened thousands of miles away in @entity181			1
@entity14 , while playing for @entity182 at the @entity183 , sank his teeth into @entity186 's @entity185 and provoked a storm of criticism and ultimately led to a four - month ban			0
on the home front , @entity0 signed boyhood fan @entity191 and his @entity87 team - mate @entity192 , who cost £ 25m			0
@entity14 holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of @entity186 defender @entity185 july it was almost inevitable that @entity14 would leave @entity22 following the @entity183 bite and so it proved			0
the @entity182 star swapped @entity22 for the @entity197 and signed for @entity15 for £ 75m , leaving a massive hole in @entity0 's attack			0
at the other end of the pitch , the @entity65 bought @entity87 's @entity204 centre half @entity202 for £ 20m			0
@entity14 smiles as he signs for @entity15 in a deal worth £ 75m august a new season began and there was an optimistic feel around @entity22 that @entity0 ’s new look team could go one better than last season despite the sale of @entity14 to @entity15			1
a new @entity34 was forming in the shape of @entity118 and @entity35 and both of them scored in a 2 - 1 opening day victory over @entity87			0
after a 3 - 1 loss at @entity26 , the month ended with @entity0 ’s best performance of the season so far as they dismantled @entity99 at @entity218 in a 3 - 0 victory			1
they also signed a relatively unknown striker by the name of @entity222 ... @entity35 ( right ) celebrates scoring @entity0 's winner in the season opener against @entity87 @entity118 ( centre ) scores as @entity0 recorded an impressive 3 - 0 win at @entity99 in august september news that @entity35 was injured while on @entity230 duty rocked @entity0 , and they started the month poorly by losing 1 - 0 to @entity40 at @entity22			1
@entity222 then got his first goal for the club as @entity0 laboured past @entity233 2 - 1 in their @entity16 return			1
worryingly , though , the @entity65 were simply bullied out of a game as they lost 3 - 1 at @entity236 , and @entity238 ’s stunning strike in injury time denied them a win in the @entity46 derby that ended 1 - 1			0
there was also a thrilling penalty shoot - out win over @entity244 that @entity0 won 14 - 13 in the @entity245			0
@entity35 picked up an injury on @entity230 duty in september and has yet to play for @entity0 since @entity222 ( third left ) scored his first goal for @entity0 in the @entity16 against @entity233 october the month started badly as @entity0 were beaten 1 - 0 in @entity250 , and their @entity16 campaign was in dire straights when they lost again , 3 - 0 at @entity22 against @entity253			1
in the @entity9 , @entity192 scored his first goal in a much - needed 2 - 1 win over @entity52 and a crazy last few minutes saw @entity0 snatch a 3 - 2 win at @entity257			2
there was also a frustrating 0 - 0 draw with @entity32 at @entity22 in which the @entity65 looked like they lacked ideas in how to break down stoke			0
one positive to end the month , though was a 2 - 1 win over @entity73 in the @entity245			0
@entity192 ( left ) scored his first @entity0 goal in october and the @entity65 won 3 - 2 at @entity262 november the first half of november saw @entity0 ’s season hit rock bottom			2
they lost four games in a row in all competitions against @entity170 , @entity253 , @entity27 and @entity159			0
@entity6 decided to rest players at the @entity270 in a move that was criticised while the collapse at @entity159 was almost as extraordinary than the one in may			0
a 2 - 2 draw in @entity274 against @entity233 set up a must - win @entity16 tie against @entity250 in december , and the month at least ended well with a 1 - 0 win over @entity38 thanks to @entity123 ’s late header			1
@entity6 ( right ) looks on as @entity0 lose against @entity159 , one of four straight defeats in november december @entity0 ’s @entity16 fate was sealed in december as they failed to beat @entity250 at home			2
a 1 - 1 draw was not enough to progress to the knockout rounds as @entity6 ’ side crashed out of the tournament			0
it was a devastating loss , and just as painful as losing 3 - 0 against @entity107			0
but december has also been a month of many positives with a 3 - 1 win at @entity290 , progress in the @entity245 after beating @entity292 3 - 1 in the quarter - finals and a @entity295 win at @entity296			0
@entity119 ’s header in the 97th minute earned @entity0 a 2 - 2 draw with @entity56 that kept their top four hopes alive going into 2015 and there was then the 1 - 0 win over @entity296			1
@entity0 need a winning streak in 2015 similar to the 11 - game run of last season to push themselves into top - four contention			1
@entity0 captain @entity71 was a dejected man as @entity0 crashed out of the @entity16 and five days later , @entity0 were emphatically beaten 3 - 0 at @entity89 by @entity107 it was more positive towards the end of the month - @entity118 hit the winner at @entity296 on @entity295			2

@entity0 put together 11 straight league wins from february to april
but a 2 - 0 defeat to @entity27 ended the run and @entity0 came second
@entity14 left for @entity15 and @entity0 have not *replaced* his goals
@entity6 ' side need another winning streak to get near top four
