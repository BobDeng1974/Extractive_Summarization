victims of ' revenge porn ' - an act of posting sexually explicit images online without a person 's permission - are pressing for a new law to make it illegal			1
revenge porn is currently legal in every state but @entity9 and @entity10 , but an increasing number of states , including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , are considering whether to make it illegal			1
@entity17 , a single mother from @entity13 , became a victim of revenge porn after her long - distance boyfriend was goading her to pose nude			1
@entity17 poses in her home in @entity21 , @entity13 @entity17 got behind the cause after an ex-boyfriend took to the @entity24 to post nude images that she shared with him privately the pictures would be for his eyes only , @entity17 , 42 , recalls him saying , because she was so beautiful and because he missed her so much			1
he promised , she said , they would be stored on a compact disc and hidden in his drawer			2
@entity17 believed him â€” until they broke up and the cd was auctioned on @entity33 with a link emailed to her friends and family			2
copies were later mailed to her son 's catholic school kindergarten teacher and the department head at the college where @entity17 taught @entity42			2
should ' revenge porn ' be made illegal ? should ' revenge porn ' be made illegal ? now share your opinion the images eventually wound up on a pornographic video - sharing site , earning 4,000 views in less than two weeks			1
' i was horrified , ' said the single mom living in @entity21 , @entity13			1
' the night he said he was going to do it , i called the police in an absolute panic and tried to explain what was going on			2
i said , ' he 's threatening to put these pictures of me on an @entity33 auction , ' and they ( said ) , ' so ? ' usually revenge porn is the result of a person sharing a sexually explicit photo or video with a partner , only to see those images pop up online months or even years later , typically after a bad breakup			1
@entity17 speaks with a reporter after a news conference to announce a bill that would criminalize revenge porn the images are often tied to the person 's name , address and phone number			1
and in a particularly disturbing twist , some of the sites appear to be running side businesses offering ' reputation protection services ' : dump $ 500 into a @entity82 account and maybe they will take down your photo			2
as an increasing number of states , are considering whether to make it illegal , groups like the @entity86 and the @entity87 say they worry such proposals run afoul of the @entity92			1
' we generally do n't think that finding more ways to put people in prison for speech is a good thing , ' said @entity99 , an activist at the @entity87			0
' a lot of times , these laws , if they are n't narrowly focused enough , they can be interpreted too broadly			0
' @entity105 , a law professor at the @entity106 who is helping states draft revenge porn laws , counters that sharing a nude picture with another person implies limited consent similar to other business transactions			1
' if you give your credit card to a waiter , you are n't giving him permission to buy a yacht , ' @entity113 said			0
the precise scope of the problem is unclear because many victims never come forward or are frequently turned away by the police			0
@entity17 , from left , @entity125 law professor @entity124 and state rep. @entity126 , @entity127 - @entity128 , are silhouetted during a news conference on revenge porn two of the most popular revenge sites have gone dark in recent years amid hacking allegations and a class - action lawsuit			1
but advocates estimate there are dozens of other sites that continue to post pornographic images without that person 's consent			0
law enforcement officials have been stumped on how to respond			2
website operators are n't liable for content provided by others , unless the images are child pornography			0
and anti-harassment and cyberstalking laws do n't apply unless the ex-partner threatens the victim or attempts repeated contact			0
@entity17 says she remembers one police officer thumbing through a black book at his desk before finally shrugging his shoulders and telling her no crime had been committed			0
law enforcement officials have been stumped on how to respond to revenge porn			1

anti-harassment and cyberstalking laws do n't apply unless the ex-partner threatens the victim or attempts repeated contact			0
copyright protections would n't help because she was n't the one who took the photos			0
suing for civil damages is another option , but that , means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner			2
copyright protections , too , would n't help because she was n't the one who took the photos			0
and even if she had , victim advocates say , most revenge sites routinely ignore ' take - down ' infringement complaints , knowing that the victims ca n't go to the expense of pursuing further legal action			1
suing for civil damages is another option , but that , too , means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner			2
@entity13 delegate @entity126 , who is running for the @entity195 nomination to become state attorney general , is among the latest of several state legislators to propose a new revenge porn law			1
his proposal would make it a felony to intentionally distribute sexually explicit digital images of another person without consent , punishable by up to five years in jail and a $ 25,000 fine			0
the bill would exclude images deemed to have ' public importance ' , an exemption carved out in response to critics who say such laws would criminalize journalists who publish explicit photos			0
the legislation also would n't hold liable anyone who links to a revenge posting			2
still absent from @entity126 's list of vocal supporters is the @entity86			0
its @entity9 office worked this fall to dilute similar legislation			1
that bill , signed last month by gov. @entity224 , makes revenge porn a misdemeanor but contains a big loophole : it applies only to images captured by the partner , exempting self - portraits			1
@entity232 , an @entity86 staff attorney in @entity15 , says self - portraits create a more complex question on the expectation of privacy because the subject shared the image willingly			1
' you , i think , could pretty easily understand how a law like that could in five minutes turn an entire class of high school seniors into felons , ' said @entity232			1
@entity246 , a @entity247 woman who founded @entity248 after her own self - shots wound up online , along with her name , where she worked and details on her @entity254 program , says attempts to exempt ' selfies ' from the law shows that most people still ' blame the victim '			2
she estimates that 80 per cent of the 1,000 victims of revenge porn who have contacted her in the past year took the images themselves			1
@entity232 and @entity99 say they are sympathetic to victims like @entity246 and @entity266			0
and there seems to be a question as to how far groups like the @entity86 and the @entity87 will go to fight revenge porn legislation ; both acknowledged their groups have n't devoted the resources yet to carving out an official position or ensuring its involvement in the drafting of every new state proposal			1
' we understand that revenge porn is destructive and that there are real victims from it and that to some extent existing laws either do n't exist or are n't being enforced to address that problem , ' said @entity232			1
but she added : ' i do n't think we 've been convinced that criminal laws , new nonviolent crimes , are necessary or necessarily effective in dealing with revenge porn			1
' as for @entity17 , she got lucky			0
@entity33 and the video - sharing site that published her photos agreed to take them down immediately			0
her son 's school did n't kick out the family , although it insisted on keeping the disc of nude photos in a file			2
and @entity17 never lost her job			0
@entity17 has since been working with @entity246 ' @entity300 , an advocacy group that targets online harassment issues , to raise awareness and help other victims			0
' i hit my low , now it 's time to fight back , ' said @entity17			0
' i do n't want to feel that way ever again			0
