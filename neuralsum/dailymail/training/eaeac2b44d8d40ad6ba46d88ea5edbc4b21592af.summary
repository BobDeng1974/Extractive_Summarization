by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 09:06 est , 22 march 2013 @entity1 has urged the world 's other major emerging economies to join forces to counter @entity6 clout			0
president @entity7 , a frequently critic of @entity8 and the @entity9 , said the @entity11 - @entity10 , @entity1 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 - should broaden their role and get more involved in geopolitics			1
his comments come as @entity13 's new communist leader sent a defiant signal to the @entity9 and @entity8 today as he arrived in @entity1 with his first lady on his first foreign trip as president			1
signal : president @entity24 and wife @entity25 arrive in @entity26 on the first foreign visit of his presidency @entity29 : the visitors from @entity13 were given the red carpet treatment when they arrived in @entity1 today important guests : @entity24 and his first lady arrived at @entity34 outside @entity26 today the visit by @entity24 underlines the importance of @entity38 's growing alliance with @entity26 and will do little to thaw the two countries ' difficult relationships with the @entity41			1
@entity1 is the world 's largest energy producer and @entity13 is it biggest consumer , and together the two nations are looking to bolster a financial and geopolitical counter weight to @entity49			2
mr @entity7 was speaking before a summit next week of the group , which also includes @entity10 , @entity12 and @entity14			2
it comes amid creasing fears of growing @entity1 influence in @entity8 through its dealings with bankrupt @entity57			2
he told news agency @entity58 that the @entity11 members were working on joint declarations on the conflicts in @entity62 and @entity63 , @entity65 's nuclear programme , the situation in the @entity67 and other issues			0
first lady : @entity25 smiled as she stepped of the plane alongside her husband earlier today ' we invite our partners to gradually transform @entity11 from a dialogue forum that coordinates approaches to a limited number of issues into a full - scale strategic cooperation mechanism that will allow us to look for solutions to key issues of global politics together , ' @entity7 said according to a @entity83 transcript of the interview			0
@entity11 leaders are expected to use the march 26 - 27 meeting in @entity88 , @entity14 to endorse plans to create a joint foreign exchange reserves pool and an infrastructure bank , senior emerging market officials said on thursday			2
@entity7 , who wants more for foreign investment to bolster @entity1 's economy , said @entity1 plans to announce the creation of a @entity95 to promote trade and investment within the group and help launch multilateral business today 's visit by @entity24 is also set against a backdrop of the @entity9 ' ' @entity104 pivot ' strategy of additional focus on the region in areas such as trade , investment and military presence and alliances , which worries @entity38			1
mr @entity24 will meet mr @entity7 later and they could preside over deals that would make @entity38 @entity1 's top customer for oil - although they are not expected to sign a long - sought agreement on supplies of pipeline gas to @entity13			1
just before mr @entity24 's arrival with first lady @entity25 , a $ 2 billion deal ( £ 1.3bn ) was announced by @entity1 and @entity13 companies to develop coal resources in eastern @entity125 , which underlined the countries ' intentions			1
mr @entity7 has said he wants to ' catch the @entity13 wind in our economic sail ' and that desire will grow stronger if @entity13 overtakes the @entity9 as the world 's largest economy during mr @entity24 's 10 - year term			1
perhaps symbolically , mr @entity24 's visit overshadowed a meeting @entity1 government leaders and the @entity139 's @entity138 also taking place in @entity26			1
guard of honour : the @entity13 president is greeted by an official welcome ceremony at the airport growing alliance : today 's visit by @entity24 underlines the importance of @entity38 's relationship with @entity26 friendship : mr @entity24 , 59 , has fondly recalled how he read @entity1 literature in his younger days the two leaders , less than a year apart in age , echoed one another in interviews before the visit , each saying the @entity13 leader 's choice of @entity26 as his first destination was evidence of the ' strategic partnership ' between the nations			1
a smiling mr @entity24 , 59 , recalled that he read @entity1 literature in his younger days			2
mr @entity7 , 60 , said @entity1 - @entity13 relations were at ' the best in their centuries - long history '			1
the two @entity169 members ' solidarity on important global issues has strengthened in recent years			0
landmark visit : the communist leader attended a ceremony at @entity26 's @entity174 they have joined forces three times to block @entity6 - backed measures on the conflict in @entity62 despite talk of grumbling in @entity38 , and @entity1 has followed @entity13 's lead on @entity183 - two issues likely to come up in friday 's talks			1
they have negotiated alongside the @entity41 on @entity65 's nuclear programme , but have watered down past sanctions in the @entity169 and opposed new punitive measures as counterproductive			0
@entity1 has added to @entity190 's woes over territorial disputes with @entity38 by playing up its control of an archipelago claimed by @entity194			0
@entity38 and @entity26 have also stood side - by - side in rejecting @entity6 criticism of their record on human rights			0
but the lockstep movement on the global stage has not translated into easy agreement on bilateral energy deals , underlining the limits that persist in the relationship			0
a huge business complex on the edge of @entity26 , decorated with @entity13 paintings and red silk armchairs , is the kind of enterprise mr @entity24 wants to nurture in @entity1			2
a jumble of @entity13 and @entity1 firms , a 400 - room hotel and conference venues sprawl over the 77 square mile , $ 350 million ( £ 2.3m ) @entity217 complex			0
it was built by a @entity38 - controlled consortium with materials shipped from @entity13			0
mr @entity24 's presidency is seen as a chance to put new impetus into such projects and into ties with @entity1 as a whole			2
mr @entity7 said this week that bilateral trade had more than doubled in five years and reached $ 87.5 billion ( £ 58m ) in 2012 - although it is about five times smaller than @entity1 's with the @entity139 , and far smaller than @entity13 's trade with the @entity9 overshadowed : @entity7 pictured yesterday with @entity138 president @entity229 tough talk : @entity1 and @entity8 officials have been meeting at mr @entity7 's @entity233 residence but the rising influence of @entity13 , with its proximity to @entity1 's sparsely populated eastern parts and nearly 10 times more people , has also given rise in @entity1 to worries @entity13 may one day challenge @entity26 's influence on its own territory			1
@entity1 has created a separate ministry to channel resources to its far east , which complains of neglect and underfunding more than 20 years after the @entity247 collapsed			0
defence analysts say @entity1 efforts to allocate military resources , including air defences and nuclear submarines , to its eastern coast is an effort to counter @entity13 's rising military might - even as @entity1 sells weapons to its neighbour			0
like their populations , their economies are uneven			0
@entity13 's gross domestic product grew 7.8 per cent last year , while @entity1 's growth was about 3.5 per cent and was close to stagnating in february , with 0.1 per cent year - on - year growth			0
mr @entity24 and mr @entity7 are expected to attend a summit next week of the @entity11 group of emerging market economies , another vehicle for their efforts to counter @entity6 clout , and the @entity13 leader will visit @entity272 nations @entity38 is courting .			1

mr @entity7 tells @entity11 nations to ' get more involved ' in geopolitics
@entity24 's visit to @entity1 is his first foreign trip as leader
it underlines importance of @entity38 's growing alliance with @entity26
visit overshadows @entity26 meeting of @entity1 and @entity8 officials
