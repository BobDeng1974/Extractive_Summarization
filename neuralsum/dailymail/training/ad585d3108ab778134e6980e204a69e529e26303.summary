one of the longest - held prisoners at the @entity2 detention center at @entity3 was sent home to @entity5 on wednesday , the first release based on the determination of a review panel that has been re-evaluating some men previously classified as too dangerous to release			1
sent home : @entity5 national @entity11 , one of the longest held prisoners of @entity13 , @entity11 , was sent back to his homeland wednesday after 13 years @entity11 had been told his release was imminent but did n't know the date until shortly before he boarded the flight back to his country from the base in southeast @entity20 , his lawyer , @entity21 , said			1
the 37 - year - old @entity11 had been the focus of an arduous battle to secure his release that had the support of his government			1
@entity21 , who spoke to him about a week before the departure , said the prisoner just wanted to get on with life			0
' there 's no bitterness , there 's no anger , ' @entity21 said			0
' there 's just excitement and joy that he will be going home			0
' @entity37 faces a minimum of one year at a militant - rehabilitation center on the grounds of a @entity5 prison under the transfer agreement			1
@entity21 said that after six months @entity11 will be eligible to leave for part of the day to work or see family			2
his transfer brings the detention center population to 148 and is the first since may , when president @entity48 angered @entity49 by trading five @entity51 prisoners for captive @entity53 sgt. @entity52 without notifying lawmakers			1
the release of @entity11 was criticized by @entity2 sen. @entity56 , a member of the @entity57 and a chief proponent of keeping the prison open			1
the @entity61 @entity60 called it ' yet another dangerous example of the @entity48 administration 's misguided motivation to empty and then close @entity3 rather than protect the national security interests of the @entity2			2
' @entity37 had been at @entity3 since february 2002 , one of the first prisoners brought to the base on suspicion of links to @entity71 or the @entity51			1
the @entity48 administration has pledged to keep trying to close the facility , which opened in january 2002 , and additional releases are expected in the coming months , so @entity11 's record as the longest - held detainee to be released is n't likely to stand long			2
his father , @entity77 , said in several interviews with the @entity79 over the years that his son was only a teacher in @entity81 who had been wrongly turned over to the @entity2 authorities in exchange for a bounty			0
' sometimes my wife calls my other son @entity87			0
other times i wake up in the middle of the night and find her sleeping in @entity87 's room , ' the father said in a 2005 interview			0
' it 's an unbearable sadness most of the time			0
' @entity37 faces a minimum of one year at a militant - rehabilitation center on the grounds of a @entity5 prison under the transfer agreement			1
@entity21 said that after six months @entity11 will be eligible to leave for part of the day to work or see family ( here , @entity3 's @entity101 is pictured in april ) the @entity5 government hired high - profile lawyers and lobbyists to push for the release of a dozen of its citizens at @entity3 , an effort set back when one carried out a suicide bomb attack in @entity114 in april 2008			1
an obama administration task force charged with evaluating all the prisoners at @entity3 placed @entity11 and another @entity5 among a group slated for indefinite ' law of war detention			1
' the men in this group ca n't be prosecuted , typically because there is not enough evidence , but the government considers them too dangerous to release			0
the administration also set up a @entity126 that has been slowly re-evaluating the prisoners with parole - style hearings to determine if some can be released as part of an overall effort to eventually close the detention center			0
in july , the board determined that @entity11 had most likely undergone terrorist training in @entity81 and may have fought alongside the @entity71 or the @entity51			1
the board , however , decided he had only a low level of training , did not have a leadership position in either group and could be released under certain conditions			0
the board has cleared a handful other detainees but they have not yet been released			0
the board determined that @entity145 , the last remaining @entity5 at @entity3 , should still be held			2
his military lawyer , @entity147 lt. col. @entity146 , said wednesday that he saw no immediate prospects for the release of his client			0
another one gone : @entity152 's transfer brings the detention center population to 148 and is the first since may , when president @entity48 angered @entity49 by trading five @entity51 prisoners for captive @entity53 sgt. @entity52 without notifying lawmakers			2
