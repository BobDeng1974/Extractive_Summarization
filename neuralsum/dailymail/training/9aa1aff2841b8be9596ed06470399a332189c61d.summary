@entity8 was born in @entity9 in 2012 with a condition called thumb aplasia , which affects one in about 100,000 infants			1
doctors said it was incredibly rare for a child to be born without thumbs but still have four normally - functioning fingers on each hand			1
but @entity8 's parents worried it was an ailment that would substantially affect him for life			2
' everything from five - fingered gloves to being able to reel in a fishing rod to being able to play a video game			2
' ' even something as simple as hitting a space bar on a keyboard – we take our thumbs for granted			0
