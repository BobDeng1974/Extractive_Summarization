the discussion between @entity0 and the women quickly heated up and size acceptance campaigner ms @entity23 is seen storming out of the room to call the police in the second episode from the series , which is set to air on saturday			1
ms @entity23 began to get upset after @entity0 questioned how she could be healthy because of the weight she was carrying			2
the former @entity45 contestant told her : ' i ’m looking at you and i ’m making an assessment that it is not healthy to carry that much weight on your knees			0
' ms @entity23 ( right ) began to get upset after @entity0 ( left ) questioned she could n't be healthy at her weight size acceptance campaigner @entity23 is seen storming out of the room after her clash with @entity0 she continued : ' i just do n’t believe you ’re healthy in that state			1
' the cost to the @entity57 is more than six billion a year , and the chief surgeon at @entity59 said “ it ’s killing millions , costing billions , and the cure is in our hands ” , and as a tax payer that ’s why i feel i do have a say , it 's because i ’m paying for your health			0
' @entity0 then turns her attention to another member of the group and asks her : ' can i ask you something ? and you , and you can answer it honestly , or not answer it at all , is why are you big ? ' the woman replies : ' because i eat too much			2
' ms @entity23 then interjects and says to @entity0 : ' do you not realise where you ’re going with this ? this is actually to do with a hate crime			1
' @entity0 then laughs and replies : ' you ’re a victim of hate crime ? ' ms @entity23 says : ' absolutely			1
and can we call the police ? ' @entity0 then tells her : ' do call the police , there ’s a telephone right there , feel free			2
' would you like it brought to you ? because it ’s probably going to be hard to walk there			0
' ms @entity23 walks outside with her mobile phone and can be seen speaking to the police about @entity0			2
she says : ' yes , it became personally offensive			0
and i believe it is a hate crime and i ’d like to report it			1
’ ms @entity23 then walks outside with her mobile phone and can be seen speaking to the police			0
she says : ' yes , it became personally offensive			0
and i believe it is a hate crime and i ’d like to report it			1
’ but after the meeting , @entity0 is unrepentant about upsetting @entity23			2
she tells cameras : ' they ’re irritated that i have a voice , one of them even threatened to go and call the police , so i told her to go and do that			0
' but , no police came , which was disappointing as i quite like a man in a uniform			0
' the argument is seen in the second episode of @entity0 's new show , with the first part airing on friday night			1
over six months , @entity0 went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit			1
the journey was all captured on camera for the documentary			0
@entity0 originally weighed 8st 12lb ( right ) but ate her way to 11st 13lb ( left ) , then dropped back down again in just a few months to prove how easy it is to lose the flab the documentary @entity0 : my fat story follows @entity0 as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day , then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise @entity0 caused an uproar last year , when she told an obese woman on this morning that she would n't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy			1
but she decided to put her money where her mouth is with her latest project , by gaining and losing 3st to prove that overweight people are unwilling - rather than unable - to lose weight			2
the weight gain hit @entity0 's emotions harder than she expected , with the mother - of - three was often reduced to tears over her size , especially when she caught sight of herself in the mirror			1
she recently told @entity145 that she even refused to have sex with her husband @entity147 after she had gained the first stone , because she felt so unattractive , previously a slim size eight , weighing in at 8st 12lb at 5ft 7in , the 39 - year - old gained nearly 3st by gorging on 6,500 calories a day and severely limiting her movement			1
with an apparently naturally high metabolism , @entity0 struggles to bring her weight up over 11st despite her high - calorie intake			1
the documentary sees her draft in @entity159 personal trainer @entity157 who devises a military - style program of what he terms ' circuit eating ' to help her gain the final pounds			0
dividing a table into four , @entity157 places different foods in each section and makes @entity0 rotate the table six times , eating the small but high calorie foods at each point			0
similar in form to exercise circuits , the idea is to maximise calorie intake , and the circuits have to be repeated every two hours			0
@entity0 refused to be intimate with husband @entity147 , pictured , after she gained a stone in weight after one particular feed , clearly uncomfortable with a distended stomach , @entity0 rants : ' it is just ridiculous what people do to themselves			2
fat people , i mean really i do n't know how they look at themselves in the mirror			1
' the documentary @entity0 : my @entity189 , follows @entity0 after she 's at her peak weight of 11st 13lb , with a 38in waist and a @entity192 of 26 , and then slims down thanks to a strict diet and exercise regime			1
in the show , we see the usually polished star in her unguarded moments			0
make - up free and in a pair of striped pyjamas , @entity0 breaks down over her larger body			2
after a weight - gain diet that included daily ' snacks ' of a litre - and - a - half of @entity206 milk drink , an entire tub of @entity208 , cheese on toast , @entity211 and @entity213 chocolate and the inclusion of a second breakfast , @entity0 then cuts her calories to a mere 1,500			2
as well as a low fat diet of porridge , salads and lean chicken with a jacket potato , @entity0 upped her daily steps from 1,000 to 20,000 daily and introduced several hour - long runs a week			2
following this self - devised plan she managed to drop down to 9st 12lb in just three months , shedding a further 6lb after the documentary ended			2
the controversial figure claims that while she did n't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children , gaining 3st ' killed her ' and left her in constant floods @entity0 kept a video diary during the making of the programme and regularly recorded her strong views on fat people			1
one video sees her explaining : ' one of the things about being fat and eating all the time is you find you do n't want to go out so much			0
you feel like you do n't really want to go out because you ca n't fit into the things you would like to wear			0
' i 'm not sure if that 's something many fat people suffer from because i see a lot of fat people out and about			1
whether that 's out of choice i do n't know but i 'm surprised that fat people go out at all			1
' but despite the hardships that she suffered after gaining weight , @entity0 maintains that she still would n't employ a fat person			2
she also told a national newspaper earlier this week that she would like to see a radical weight - loss scheme implemented in schools , which would see children weighed on the premises			0
the fattest 10 per cent of children would then be reported to social services			0
the controversial former reality star has been as active on @entity261 , defending her views on being overweight @entity0 first embarked on the weight - gain and weight - loss scheme after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size			1
speaking on @entity269 's @entity268 in september she said : ' one in ten of our children are starting school overweight or obese and one in three children who are 15 or over are overweight or obese			0
' people have always said to me , " you 're lucky , you 're skinny , " and i just do n't think these excuses are cutting it any more			0
' i saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat			0
i just thought , we have to put an end to this			0
' while she now has greater sympathy for people with weight issues , @entity0 is continuing to be outspoken on the topics , using her @entity261 account to make digs at larger people in her neighbourhood			2
she recently tweeted : ' my local over / under active thyroid self help group meets in @entity296			0
' she also posted : ' i see you all down there with your excuses , but a third of the planet is obese			0
the first step to slim is no excuses			0
' @entity0 : my @entity189 , airs friday and saturday , 2 and 3 january at 9pm on @entity9 .			0
