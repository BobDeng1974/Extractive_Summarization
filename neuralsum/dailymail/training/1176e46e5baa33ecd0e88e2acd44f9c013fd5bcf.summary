mr @entity0 , from @entity14 , said it was known in advance that the 5.48am service on september 29 from @entity34 to @entity35 would be one member of staff short			1
but then the chef phoned in sick , reducing the catering crew to just four			2
the crew then found out via e-mail that the train had a broken boiler , meaning the crew could not serve cooked breakfasts , due to a lack of hot water			1
instead , they handed out warmed - up paninis with bacon or scrambled egg and roast tomatoes - much to the customers ' annoyance			2
mr @entity0 said : ' the passengers were not happy			1
the passenger who complained said the bacon panini was disgraceful - to put it politely			0
it tasted and looked disgusting			0
' they were annoyed because they were not getting what they were paying for			0
some took it out on the staff			0
one member of staff was in tears as a result			0
