@entity1 , 34 , agreed to pay a paltry fine of £ 110 instead of serving the rest of his sentence			1
his lawyer @entity14 cited the case of @entity16 striker @entity10 , who last month paid a £ 3,000 fine to avoid the rest of his 250 - hour community service order for motoring offences so that he could leave @entity20 and join @entity22 club @entity21			1
mr @entity14 told @entity24 magistrates that ‘ what goes for the rich , goes for the poor ’ and suggested that the two cases could lead to many more court punishments being ‘ swapped ’ because they are inconvenient			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ what happened with @entity10 could open the floodgates			1
maybe people with minor issues could get orders revoked on the grounds of ill - health or change of residence			0
’ @entity1 , from @entity37 , near @entity38 , was stopped in his @entity39 in nearby @entity40 on may 16			0
a breath test found he had 94 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath – almost three times the legal limit			0
on may 29 , he admitted drink - driving and @entity24 magistrates sentenced him to a six - month community order – including alcohol rehabilitation and a supervision requirement			1
they also imposed a two - year driving ban and ordered him to pay £ 85 costs			0
on tuesday , however , they agreed with @entity1 ’s plea that he should not have to serve the community order because he wants to live with his parents on their yacht moored off a @entity3 island			1

£ 3000 fine : @entity10 , paid to avoid the rest of his 250 - hour community service order for motoring offences so that he could join @entity22 club @entity21 mr @entity14 said : ‘ the magistrate said it was an unusual application			1
‘ i mentioned the @entity10 case in the hearing and said , “ if you can do it for the rich , it can be done for the poor ”			1
‘ what a case like that does is heighten the profile of something that is already there , but not been used in a while			0
' the @entity10 case opened up a window of opportunity for people like my client to exercise the court ’s discretion			2
precedent : mr @entity1 's lawyer @entity14 told @entity24 magistrates that ' what goes for the rich , goes for the poor ' ' his mum was prepared to take him to @entity3 and thought it was better for him to be abroad without an order , away from influences making him drink			1
’ the basis for the defence is that the defendant is not responsible in law for their inability to comply with the order			0
it is only used on rare occasions and has to be paid for privately because it is not available on legal aid			0
however , mr @entity14 said : ‘ it is a defence i would consider using again if a client approached me and asked me to			0
it is being used more often now due to the @entity10 case as people know it is available to them			2

last month , district judge @entity115 , sitting at @entity112 magistrates ’ court , accepted that there were circumstances beyond @entity10 ’s control in his inability to fulfil the terms of the order			1
she said : ‘ this is only a technical breach			0
it is not , i repeat not , a case of a footballer thumbing his nose at a court order			2
’ it is thought @entity10 ’s legal team argued that because he was sold by @entity20 , he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order			2
@entity10 is believed to have been earning £ 250,000 a week with @entity20 , making his £ 3,000 fine the equivalent of half an hour ’s work .			1
