judge @entity15 , had to sentence prolific offenders @entity16 , 21 , and @entity18 , 20 , to less than 18 months after they stole a car and fled police in a 100mph chase across two counties , which ended when their @entity23 smashed into @entity1 ’s car leaving her severely injured			1
judge @entity25 , who is bound by strict sentencing guidelines laid down by the government , handed the maximum possible sentences of two years each for aggravated vehicle taking but both terms were automatically reduced by a third due to the men ’s guilty pleas			1
however , he stunned @entity33 , @entity34 when he said the pair deserved much longer behind bars			0
he said : ' you will get out of prison and will get your life back but @entity1 will never get over this , physically or mentally			1
' it is absurd - if i just pass sentence and allow credit for your guilty pleas , because i have to - it will not be enough			0
i am stuck with it because of what the law says , and i ca n’t abide it			1
' @entity1 has suffered a very great deal and both defendants are in their twenties with appalling previous records			2
' you deserve , both of you , to go to prison for a very long time and i greatly regret that i am restricted in what sentence i can give you because of what @entity62 has decided			0
' you say you are sorry and i hope that you are because the sentence i have passed is nothing like enough			0
' miss @entity1 , 25 , of @entity66 , @entity34 , suffered ' appalling injuries ' as she broke her back and suffered bleeding to her brain in the crash and was left clinging to life in hospital			1
her kneecap was also broken and she was airlifted to @entity74 , @entity75 , and placed in a drug - induced coma			0
jail : @entity16 , 21 , left , and @entity18 , 20 , right , were sentenced to less than 18 months after they stole a car and fled police in a 100mph chase across two counties then crashed into @entity1 's car crash scene : the reckless high - speed chase ended when the pair lost control of the @entity23 and smashed into @entity1 ’s @entity88 leaving her severely injured and clinging to life she had completed charity marathons and coast - to - coast adventure races , but will never make a full recovery from the injuries she suffered in the crash in april and she now walks with the aid of a back brace			1
@entity16 and @entity18 , both from @entity97 , were both sentenced after they admitted charges of aggravated vehicle taking			2
the court heard that @entity18 was arrested at the scene but @entity16 fled and did not turn himself in to police until five days later			1
frustration : judge @entity25 stunned @entity33 , @entity34 , when he said the pair deserved much longer behind bars law graduate @entity106 looked on in tears as the two men were sentenced - 18 months for the driver of the stolen car @entity18 , and 16 months for his passenger @entity16			1
the pair - who both have a long string of motoring offences - were banned from the roads for five years			0
miss @entity1 is no longer able to drive , so had to catch the bus from her home to be at court to witness the men who ruined her life being sentenced			1
she said : ' i just feel so relieved that it is over but my life has changed and i wo n’t get that back			2
' i have been told that i may need my kneecap replaced when i reach 50 and i wo n’t ever get compensated for that			2
' i love my sports but i have not been able to compete and it has also affected my relationships with people because i have changed since it happened			0
' miss @entity1 welcomed the men ’s ban from the roads			0
she added : ' i am really happy that they have been disqualified from driving for five years - that is the bit that is hopefully going to make a difference			0
' they have so many previous driving offences - their records went on for pages			0
' @entity143 , prosecuting , had told the court the men had stolen the @entity23 from a caravan park in @entity147 at 5.30am on april 5			0
miss @entity1 used to compete in gruelling physical competitions - but after the accident will never be able to compete again court : miss @entity1 told @entity151 , pictured , that she is no longer able to drive , so caught the bus from her home to be at court to witness the men who ruined her life being sentenced the pair headed towards @entity158 at incredibly fast speeds - often over 100mph - and at one stage going 80mph in a 30mph residential area			1
the car was seen cutting between lanes on the @entity165 as police followed them			0
they finally lost control on a right - hand bend causing a massive crash involving miss @entity1 ’s car , a police car and a @entity174 on the @entity175 at @entity176 .			2
