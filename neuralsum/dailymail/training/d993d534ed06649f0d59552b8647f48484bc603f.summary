by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 12 april 2013 @entity1 has broken out among @entity3 groups in @entity4 over plans to build a memorial to non @entity3 who risked their lives to save those trapped inside the @entity10 ghetto			1
under the plans , the memorial to @entity4 ' righteous ' gentiles will be located in the heart of what used to be the @entity10 ghetto			1
however , this has angered the @entity3 community in @entity4 who claim it would infringe on the memory of murdered jews			1
controversy : @entity1 has broken out among @entity3 groups in @entity4 over plans to build a memorial to non @entity3 at the site of former @entity10 ghetto			1
in this picture , a group of @entity3 are escorted from the @entity27 although the jewish community do not dispute the reasons behind the monument , it feels it should be placed on the edge of the site			1
according to the @entity35 , @entity4 's @entity34 wrote in an open letter : ' @entity4 is a large country so there is plenty of capacity for a monument to the @entity41 , but let the @entity27 remain an inviolate area dedicated to the memory of murdered @entity3			1
' unhappy : for many , the efforts of @entity45 who risked their lives to smuggle weapons into the @entity10 ghetto and to get prisoners out have been sidelined for many , the efforts of @entity45 who risked their lives to smuggle weapons into the @entity27 and to get prisoners out have been sidelined			2
the @entity27 was established in the @entity4 capital in 1940 , while the country was being occupied by @entity56			1
all 400,000 @entity3 living in the city , which was then a major centre of @entity3 culture , were ordered to live in the area , which was surrounded by a 10ft wall			2
even though the @entity63 housed 30 per cent of @entity10 's population , it occupied just one - fortieth of the city 's area , leading to unbearably cramped conditions			2
the area was plagued with disease and starvation , causing the deaths of thousands - but the worst horrors came between july and september 1942 , when more than 250,000 residents were sent to the @entity76 camp , where nearly all were murdered by the @entity78			2
in january 1943 , @entity80 soldiers started another round of deportations , but this time the @entity3 residents fought back			0
the @entity84 briefly succeeded in stopping the deportations , but later that year was brutally put down			0
56,000 @entity3 were killed or deported in retribution			0
they feel more attention has been placed on @entity3 insurgents who launched a battle against @entity56 rule in 1943 knowing that they faced death			0
they battled for a month during the @entity84 and inspired jews all around the world			2
but those behind the plans for the monument feel the efforts of the @entity45 should be given a greater recognition			0
doctor @entity98 , from @entity10 's @entity99 , said : ' what we have here is almost a competitive bidding between the @entity4 and @entity3 communities over the scale of their martyrdom in the @entity108 '			1
the dispute comes days before @entity4 prepares to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the @entity84			1
it is not the first time a statue has cause outrage and disturbed sensitivities surrounding the @entity27			0
in november last year , a modern artist caused huge controversy after placing a statue of @entity119 praying on his knees in the former @entity27			0
the statue by @entity123 artist @entity122 , entitled ' @entity124 ' , attracted a large number of visitors			0
the work was visible only from a distance , and the artist has not said what he intends viewers to read into @entity119 's pose			0
organisers of the exhibition of which the statue was a part said its point was to make people reflect on the nature of evil - but some were angered by its placement in such a sensitive site .			0
