@entity1 's youngest sex swap patient has resorted to working as an escort - to pay for her treatment			1
@entity4 , 21 , from @entity5 , hit the headlines when , at 16 , she became the youngest person in @entity1 to be accepted for gender reassignment			1
but part way through her treatment , the stress of her transition from male to female became too much and she called a halt to it			1
she said : ' working as an escort can be dangerous and frightening			1
it 's exhausting sometimes too			2
' but it 's the only way i have of earning enough money to become a woman			1
' her initial treatment , and her subsequent decision to abandon the reassignment programme , sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed to swap sexes in the first place			1
but @entity4 insists that her decision was the right one - and blames @entity37 psychiatrists and doctors for clouding her focus			1
@entity4 was born @entity40 in january 1994 , and grew up with her mum , @entity41 , 46 , and three sisters , @entity45 , now 29 , @entity42 , 26 , and @entity43 , 23			1
born @entity40 , @entity4 realised she was born in the wrong body and at 16 was accepted for treatment @entity4 says : ' from an early age , i wanted to play with my sisters ' @entity51 dolls			1
my mum bought me action men but i was n't interested			0
' i used to love watching her put make - up on			0
i was always stealing her lipstick			0
' at school , my friends were all girls and i loved playing netball			0
' i knew i had been born in the wrong body and i wanted so desperately to be a girl			1
' i was an angry kid , because i was so confused , and though i was never bullied , i got into trouble , and i ended up expelled from school			0
' at 15 , she announced that she wanted to become a girl			2
she says : ' it was hardly a shock			0
my family had always known			0
my mum and sisters were very supportive			0
' at 16 , @entity4 was referred for specialist psychiatric assessments and she began dressing and living as a girl , painting her nails and growing her hair			1
however @entity4 , pictured centre with her mother and sister , said she actually wanted to be a boy part way through her @entity37 treatment - sparked huge debate over whether she was too young to be allowed but @entity4 blames @entity37 medics for clouding her focus - and says she does want to be a woman her story hit the press as she became @entity1 's youngest sex - swap patient			1
but she rebelled against the treatment programme			2
she says : ' i hated the psychiatric treatment			2
i felt as though i was being made to justify why i wanted to be a girl , like they wanted to catch me out almost			2
' i knew i was a girl inside , and to me , it was that simple			0
' at 17 , she began a course of hormone injections but stopped the treatment after two suicide attempts			1
she says : ' the whole thing just got on top of me			0
i was sick of travelling to my appointments where i felt everyone was trying to catch me out and trip me up			0
' i felt so alone , so isolated			0
i just wanted to be happy			2
my treatment caused a lot of stress in my family and i just wanted everything to go back to how it was			1
' her full transgender op , scheduled for january 2013 , was called off and she returned to living as a young man - but says she soon realised she could not live a lie			2
she is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately , using her work as an escort to fund her surgery			1
she is now saving to pay for gender reassignment privately , using her work as an escort to fund her surgery @entity4 has n't asked the @entity37 to fund this reassignment , and doubts they would , because she pulled out last time			1
she also feels the psychiatric assessments were too invasive and the @entity37 programme was too invasive , so she wants to fund it herself			0
first on her list is a Â£ 4,500 breast enlargement , followed by surgery to remove her male genitalia			0
@entity4 says : ' i 've always wanted to be a girl and that has never changed			1
i was born in the wrong body			0
' my work as an escort is not ideal , but it is virtually impossible for me to get any kind of work , because of the stigma which surrounds transgender people			2
i see this as my only chance to fulfil my dreams			0
' the following is part on an @entity37 guide if your child is under 18 and thought to have gender dysphoria , they will usually be referred to a specialist child and adolescent @entity148 ( @entity147 )			2
