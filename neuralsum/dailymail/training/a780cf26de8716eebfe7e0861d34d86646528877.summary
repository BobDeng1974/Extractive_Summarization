by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 18:14 est , 13 november 2012 the irony of the former @entity3 director getting caught in a sex scandal even though he was presumably the country 's top spymaster is obvious			0
but that does n't mean that @entity8 and his biographer - turned - mistress @entity9 did n't use some handy espionage tradecrafts to keep their liaisons a secret for nearly a year			1
@entity8 and @entity9 would communicate using a dummy @entity14 account that they set up as a modern version of the classic spy ' dead drop ' trick , where they would leave their messages in the account 's draft folder to save it for the other to see			1
affair : @entity8 is pictured with @entity9 , his biographer and alleged mistress insult : a photograph in june 2011 shows @entity9 watching as @entity8 and his wife holly arrive for a @entity31 hearing on @entity8 ' nomination to be director of the @entity3 rather than sending each other actual emails , which would create an electronic paper trail , they would write messages and save them as drafts			1
the other would then log in to the same account , view the message , delete it and then leave a response that would also be saved rather than sent			1
dead drops , wherein spies leave messages for their sources or informants at a neutral location and then the individual would go and pick up the message before returning with their own response			1
in the digital era , however , @entity14 's draft folder creates an easy space for teenagers , terrorists , and apparently philandering politicians to do the same			2
deception : @entity9 is married to a radiologist , @entity60 ( left ) , and they have two young sons together , while @entity8 has been married to @entity63 for 38 years			1
they have two grown children @entity8 was the one to set up the fake account in this case , and he used a pseudonym to do so			1
the pair may never have been caught if @entity9 did n't go against the papertrail the save - but - do n't - send trick safeguarded the lovers from			2
the scandal came under investigation only after @entity9 used one of her email accounts to send anonymous emails to @entity80 housewife @entity79			2
from right : @entity82 , @entity79 and her husband @entity60 , gen @entity8 and @entity79 's sister @entity84 far left the 37 - year - old @entity79 knows a number of high - profile military men because she is an honorary social liaison for @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity80			2
@entity79 contacted a friend of hers who is an @entity92 agent because she felt threatened and feared for her safety after receiving a half - dozen anonymous emails			0
a government official told the @entity96 that the emails contained such language as : ' i know what you did , ' ' back off ' and ' stay away from my guy			0
' the official added : ' ( @entity9 ) clearly thought something was going on ' and thought she was in a ' lovers triangle			2
' a person who knows both mrs @entity79 and @entity8 confirmed their friendship and said she saw him often			0
' very sexy ' : @entity79 has been accused of sending ' flirtatious ' messages to another general , @entity110 enjoying herself ? @entity79 laughs while checking her phone in her @entity89 home on tuesday all three of those involved - @entity79 , @entity8 and @entity9 - were all married to other people and they all have multiple children			1
the @entity117 and her surgeon husband @entity60 - have been close family friends with @entity8 and @entity82 for around five years and the two couples have been frequently photographed together at parties			0
government sources have said that @entity79 exchanged emails and ims with @entity8 daily but those were on his official account and were monitored by staff members , and are not considered inappropriate			1
now another four - star general has been roped into the allegations , as the @entity129 has since started its own investigation into 20,000 to 30,000 pages of communications between @entity110 , the commander of @entity135 and @entity136 forces in @entity137 , and @entity79			0
scandal : gen. @entity110 , pictured before the @entity139 in march as his wife and daughter look on , is under investigation for sending ' inappropriate emails ' to a military party planner @entity110 and mrs @entity79 met in the same manner that she became close with @entity8 , as @entity110 served on the same @entity80 base from 2008 to 2011			0
the same innocent nature of the communications between @entity79 and @entity8 can not be said about her emails with @entity110 , as investigators flagged a number of them for being ‘ flirtatious ’			0
they have not specified whether it was done by @entity79 , @entity110 or both			0
the @entity154 gave the example of @entity110 's use of the word ' sweetheart ' in referring to married mom @entity79 , but a senior @entity129 official said that proves nothing as the 58 - year - old general is from @entity163 and the word is used in the south as a platonic phrase and not one demonstrating a romantic relationship .			0

@entity8 set up a @entity14 account under a pseudonym
@entity9 had access and they would leave messages for each other in the drafts , which is a modern version of a ' dead drop ' maneuver
the couple would delete their messages after reading so there was no electronic paper trail
