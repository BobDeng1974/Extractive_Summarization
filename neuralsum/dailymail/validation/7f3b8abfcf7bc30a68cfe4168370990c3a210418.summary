it was once an eagerly anticipated new block of flats , built to help with the housing crisis in @entity3 and standing as the city 's tallest building			1
but in a mere eight seconds @entity6 , a 20 - storey tower block measuring more than 190ft high in the @entity9 estate of @entity3 , was flattened to leave just a pile of rubble behind			1
people lined the streets to watch the demolition , which took place almost 50 years after the high rise was first built			1
it was knocked down as part of a ' masterplan ' for the state which will see a new shopping centre , a care home and affordable housing built			1
but for some people who had seen the vast tower block planned and built , the scale and speed of its destruction was a sad event			2
@entity38 , 58 , said : ' i was a young girl living in north @entity3 when this block of flats was built			2
@entity6 was built in 1969 to help with the housing crisis and extended over 19 floors but yesterday explosives were used to demolish it the building began to topple to the right hand side as the explosives tore through the bottom section and dust and rubble collected as the tower began to fall huge plumes of smoke and clouds of dust were seen coming from the building as it clattered towards the ground in seconds the 190ft high building fell towards the ground to make way for a planned new estate that will see new houses built eight seconds after the explosion the tower block was no more , and replaced by smoke and piles or rubble as workmen looked on ' i remember the new building being celebrated because there was a houses shortage at the time but now its demolition is being celebrated			1
it is quite emotional really			0
' the tower was built in 1969 and stood as one of the tallest parts of the city , along with @entity79			2
@entity80 , 61 , said : ' i ca n't believe that a block of flats that size , which took an age to build , could be demolished as quickly as that			0
the 19 storey building was flattened to the ground on sunday afternoon and workers will now have to begin clearing the large site all that is left of @entity6 high rise is now large slabs of concrete and twisted metal after it was demolished within a matter of seconds the tower block , shown previously , was built in the 1960s and was the tallest building in the city of @entity3 , as well as the infirmary ' one minute it was there , the next it was gone and that is that			1
it was an eyesore but i will miss it when i walk past every morning			0
' more than 400 affordable homes are currently being built on the estate - many of which are being made more energy efficient			0
councillor @entity113 , of @entity114 , said : ' it is an exciting time for residents of @entity9			0
' @entity6 was one of the tallest buildings in the city along with @entity79 so it is a big deal that it is coming down but our masterplan for @entity9 will improve the estate hugely			0
