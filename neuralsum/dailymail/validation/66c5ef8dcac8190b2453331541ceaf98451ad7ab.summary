when @entity1 has time between figuring out the @entity3 conundrum and plotting @entity6 ’s @entity5 return , @entity0 would love a coffee			1
@entity0 is keen to pick the brains of his former coach , in his words one of the world ’s greatest , to help @entity15 @entity14 ’s promotion push			1
the former @entity17 international is doing pretty well so far by himself in his first managerial job in @entity19 , leading @entity20 to top spot since surprisingly taking over in november			1
@entity0 has impressed since taking over at @entity14 ; they are top of @entity15 hasselbaink scores for @entity25 , against @entity26 , during his playing days in april 2004 @entity28 's graphic shows @entity0 's long and illustrious career across a number of countries but getting advice from the @entity6 manager with whom he shares a bond can only help			1
‘ i was always one of his favourites , ’ smiles @entity0 , who won most of his 23 @entity37 caps under @entity38			1
‘ he wanted to sign me for @entity43 from @entity25 in 2003			1
i will never forget this			2
the fee was already arranged , then they played @entity46 , he lost at home , he got the sack , and the deal did n’t go through			2
’ does @entity0 recognise the prickly @entity38 we have seen during low ebbs this season ? his face lights up			1
‘ he is mild ! i ’m telling you , ’ he says			2
‘ i have not spoken to him yet			2
i need to find the time to go over to @entity57 and have a cup of coffee or tea with him when he is not that busy			2
‘ he is somebody who tells you exactly what he wants , how he wants and when he wants			2
but he is a very loving man and a top coach , one of the best in the world			1
@entity1 and @entity0 get on well , and the @entity20 boss would like some advice from his countryman @entity0 and @entity38 ( centre ) know each other from when the now @entity6 boss was in charge of @entity37 @entity0 is doing well on his own , but admits he would like to sit down for a chat with the @entity6 boss ‘ of course he has come in for criticism because he is manager of one of the biggest clubs in the world , but let ’s not forget , @entity6 is changing			1
i am 100 per cent he will succeed and they will play attractive football			2
’ @entity0 would hope players under his guidance one day say similar things about him			1
at 43 , his managerial career is embryonic			2
he was a novice when he took the reins , despite a year at @entity92 in @entity93			2
his first fortnight at @entity20 brought challenges even the most experienced manager might have found daunting			1
in his debut training session goalkeeper @entity97 broke his leg			2
‘ he is a guy who everybody really likes so that was a big blow , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ but he is back training and getting stronger			2
’ then , just days after his first match in charge , at @entity106 , there was an emotionally crushing event — the funeral of @entity109 , a 17 - year - old who played for @entity20 ’s women ’s team			1
she had collapsed and died at home on november 4			2
@entity0 thinks @entity38 is one of the best coaches in the world , and insists he was one of his favourites @entity0 had an esteemed playing career , pictured celebrating a goal for @entity25 in 2001 @entity0 admits that as a player he was more loud - and sweary - than he is as a manager ‘ that was devastating , ’ says @entity0 , his eyes dewy			1
‘ i have an 18 - year - old and for somebody to lose their child at that age is not right			2
’ he bangs the table			2
‘ that was very hard			2
the only thing i could do was go to the funeral and represent the club the right way			2
i still have @entity109 ’s black armband in my office hung up			0
you get reminded of the real things in life			0
’ to hear @entity0 talk with such sensitivity only underlines why chairman @entity140 selected him ahead of 60 other applicants when predecessor @entity142 left for @entity143			1
@entity140 has a knack here , also giving @entity145 and @entity146 their breaks in management			0
@entity0 ’s motivation to plunge into the lower divisions was not obvious			1
this is a man who scored so many @entity155 goals for @entity156 , @entity25 , @entity157 and @entity158 ( 127 ) he still sits 11th on the all - time list , despite retiring seven years ago			1
the @entity20 boss sat down with @entity28 's @entity161 at the club 's stadium after a training session @entity0 's yearly earnings are believed to be around £ 40,000 - minimal compared to his playing days money is not the driving factor			1
when it is suggested he earns in a year what he once earned per week at @entity25 he grins			1
the figure is believed to be about £ 40,000 a year			0
if he simply wanted to stay in football he could have ticked along with punditry jobs			0
as recently as last october he was on @entity173			0
‘ as much as i ’ve enjoyed the punditry , it ’s very easy sitting there and judging people , ’ he says			0
‘ you ’re not under pressure			0
do you know what has happened in that week ’s training ? you do n’t			0
‘ so i always wanted to be with the players , seeing them smiling , sweating and , at times , moaning			0
the second best thing in football — after playing			0
’ still , why @entity20 ? @entity0 answers emphatically			1
‘ it was a great opportunity			0
a very stable club with ambition , a great chairman who works with his managers , a good squad , excellent training facilities , and you can teach players			0
the @entity20 boss could easily pick up more than he currently earns , but he wants to cut his teeth at lower level @entity200 ( left ) and @entity201 ( right ) watch on as @entity0 celebrates a goal at @entity203 ‘ i did n’t look at @entity15 , @entity204 , @entity205 or whatever			1
i was always looking at the job			0
can i have a @entity0 feeling there ? what ’s the identity of the club ? does it fit with me ? do i fit with them ? ’ we are sitting in an executive suite at @entity20 ’s @entity216 , a neat ground with 7,000 capacity , opened a decade ago			1
training at nearby @entity219 — the @entity221 centre of excellence costing £ 105million — has just finished			0
it does seem to fit			0
@entity0 finds inspiration in @entity225 ’s incredible rise through the ranks ; bottom of the @entity228 to established @entity155 force in 10 years			1
‘ @entity225 have the perfect model			1
they have an identity of the club and then they find a manager who fits			0
a lot of other clubs get a manager because he is doing well			0
he then wants to change lots of players			0
‘ @entity225 have kept their way of playing			1
every manager who has come has tweaked it a bit , but not lost the identity of the club			0
@entity0 has impressed since taking over at @entity20 in november , and looks to be closing in on promotion the @entity20 boss wants to follow the model of @entity225 , who rose from the lower leagues to the very top ‘ we are still far , far away from @entity225			1
but they give smaller clubs hope because of how structured and stable they are			0
if you plan well you have an opportunity to go far , if you stick with that belief			0
’ @entity0 ’s belief in a passing style has seen @entity20 win 14 , draw five and lose three of his matches to date			1
they can go five points clear at the top if they beat @entity259 at home on monday night			1
‘ what has surprised me is that the players are better than people say they are , ’ he says			0
‘ i find that there are some really technical players in @entity15			1
’ he tries to remain cool on the touchline			0
‘ i want to stay as focused on my team as possible , because that ’s where i can affect the game			0
i ’m trying not to swear at the fourth official			0
‘ so far i ’ve been more than good ! no four - letter words			0
as a player i was different and always at it			0
i try to be as respectable as possible			0
’ @entity275 is another manager @entity0 speaks to in order to get advice on coaching @entity279 signed @entity0 for @entity157 during the @entity20 manager 's playing days in the mid 2000 's @entity281 lives fairly close and ‘ at times we go for lunch or a quick supper ’ , says @entity0			1
@entity281 signed him for @entity157 and took him to @entity285 as a coach , his last role in @entity19			2
@entity281 had one response when @entity0 asked him about the @entity20 offer : ‘ take it			1
’ @entity0 says : ‘ he ’s a very good manager			1
i pick up a lot but i do n’t copy			2
you have to make things your own			0
he is somebody i can call if i need to ask advice			0
’ @entity296 is another @entity0 has phoned			1
where he does not wish for assistance , as he sees it , is through the colour of his skin			0
@entity0 , studying for his @entity301 , is one of only five black managers in the @entity228 , but rejects the proposal of a @entity304 that would ensure at least one candidate for each vacancy is from a minority ethnic background			1
he says : ‘ if i apply for a job i want to get an interview because they think i am the right person			0
not because one of the six has to be black			0
i want to know they want me because they think i can take the club further			0
otherwise i do n’t need it			0
’ it would appear @entity20 , with sights on breaking into the third tier for the first time in their history , need @entity0 .			1

@entity0 has taken @entity14 to top of @entity15
the former @entity25 striker says he gets on well with @entity1
@entity0 is keen to pick the brains of his former international coach
he wants to follow @entity225 's model to get his @entity20 side to the top
