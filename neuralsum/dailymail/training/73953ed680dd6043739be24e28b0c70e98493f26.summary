10 years on : why @entity0 were the greatest @entity1 side click here to read more about @entity4 defender @entity3 an air of trepidation descends upon @entity0 at annual general meeting time			1
manager @entity8 , majority shareholder @entity9 and chief executive @entity10 all sat on the top table , perched like sitting ducks , waiting for one disgruntled shareholder or supporter to unleash his or her wrath			1
they need n’t have worried this time , though , as thursday 's @entity7 passed without serious incident			1
@entity0 boss @entity8 attended the @entity7 on thursday with several shareholders the @entity7 was quiet and on the whole calm , perhaps due to @entity0 ending their trophy draught last season @entity8 celebrates at the @entity25 winners ' parade after his side 's triumph at @entity28 @entity0 v @entity29 kick - off : 3pm at the @entity31			1
@entity0 should be looking forward to playing @entity33 ’s men			1
in their last 12 @entity1 visits to the capital , @entity29 have lost nine times and won just once			0
the good news for @entity29 fans ? that win came this season at @entity41			0
there was no repeat of 2012 ’s angry affair when fans vented their fury at @entity46 and @entity9 before @entity8 emerged as the club ’s hero once more with a rousing call to arms			1
of course , last season ’s euphoric @entity25 win has helped placate some supporters ; no longer did they have the club ’s near 10 - year trophy drought to use as a battering ram on such occasions			0
there are those who believe a solitary trophy since 2005 still is n’t good enough for a club of @entity0 ’s stature			1
however , but for one awkward question from an unhappy supporter asking @entity8 why he failed to sign a new central defender during the summer transfer window , even @entity8 ’s biggest critics were far from vocal on thursday			1
things , however , are n’t quite so serene at the club ’s medical department back at their @entity70			0
@entity0 have nine first - team players unavailable for saturday 's clash against @entity29			1
@entity8 ’s biggest concern is in defence , with @entity75 ( achilles ) , @entity77 ( ankle ) and @entity79 ( suspended ) all unavailable for the repeat of last year ’s @entity25 final			1
@entity3 is once again being tipped for a move to north @entity70 but any deal for the @entity4 defender will have to wait until january			1
@entity75 will miss the @entity29 game with an achilles problem , but @entity8 says he does n't need surgery @entity75 ’s long - term fitness is a major concern			1
his injury is a long - standing problem which has deteriorated in recent weeks			0
‘ it has got worse , he finds it difficult to play with at the moment , ’ said @entity8 , who insisted the @entity92 international does not require surgery			1
‘ if you wait for it to be better , it can be a short time			0
if you want to get rid of it completely , it is long term			0
we will monitor him and as soon as he can take enough pain again he will play			0
’ the fear is @entity75 ’s injury could manifest into a problem that could see him miss months rather than weeks , leaving @entity8 with the dilemma of whether to hand @entity75 an extended break or continue playing him and risk aggravating the injury further			1
@entity75 ’s absence means @entity8 is almost certain to use left back @entity114 as a makeshift central defender alongside @entity116 against @entity29 in a back four that could also consist of rookie right back @entity119 and @entity120			1
@entity0 ’s lack of central defensive options merely gave weight to shareholder @entity125 ’s question about why @entity8 failed to sign a new defender following the exit of @entity128 to @entity129			1
given the opportunity to answer mr @entity125 ’s query by chairman sir @entity133 , the @entity0 manager declined , much to the fan ’s anger			2
‘ that was a disgrace			0
i asked a question which every @entity0 fan i know feels so strongly about , which is why we went into this season with a very vulnerable defence , ’ said mr @entity125			2
‘ i wanted to know if funds were available to strengthen the defence			0
the chairman said they always backed the manager			0
he offered @entity8 the chance to respond and he did n’t			2
’ @entity114 ( pictured chasing @entity146 ) could fill in at centre back this weekend @entity128 signed for @entity129 in the summer and @entity0 are yet to find a replacement @entity3 could be on his way to @entity0 in january as the @entity4 defender has impressed however , @entity8 did explain how he plans to solve the club ’s defender shortage in 2015			1
speaking at the start of the meeting , @entity8 explained : ‘ i agree we could have bought one more player but we did n’t find one			2
‘ but we will try in january to rectify that because we are a bit short because of the injuries we ’ve had			2
’ @entity161 is the leading candidate to fill the void			0
scouts have made regular checks on the former @entity166 under 21 centre half , who was called into the senior squad for the first time last month , and @entity170 understands the club failed in a £ 7million deadline - day attempt to land the 23 - year - old			1
the club , however , maintain an interest in @entity161 and are primed to return for the @entity175 once the transfer window re-opens			2
hopefully , that will calm mr @entity125 ’s angst			0
the big - money captures of @entity180 and @entity181 over the past 14 months have helped dispel the theory from some supporters that the club ’s board are happy to sit on vast cash reserves			2
around £ 25m will be made available to @entity8 in january to help strengthen the squad			1
but @entity10 , often the man left facing the brunt of hardline questioning at recent @entity191 , sought to obliterate the notion that the club are holding back in the transfer market			2
‘ inaccurate and superficial analysis leads to stories that we are hoarding a huge cash balance			0
that is simply not the case , ’ insisted the club ’s chief executive			0
‘ it ’s quite untrue to suggest that the club is sitting on a huge cash pile which , for some unspecified reason , it refuses to use			1
’ @entity8 will hope the remainder of the season is as smooth as the agm			2
@entity161 ( left ) challenges fellow defender @entity208 at @entity4 training as boss @entity210 ( right ) looks on @entity3 is a 23 - year - old @entity175 centre back who plays his football for @entity4			1
he ’s been extensively scouted by a host of top @entity216 clubs			0
what ’s his pedigree ? he came through the ranks at @entity220 in @entity166 before moving to @entity221 as a teenager , where he played in the same side as @entity226 ’s @entity225			0
he has played for the @entity175 under 19 and @entity227 21 sides and in 2013 he moved to @entity4 for £ 2.6million			2
what kind of player is he ? he ’s 6ft 4in , so it ’s no surprise to hear that he ’s strong in the air			0
but he ’s composed on the ball too			0
he ’s particularly strong in one - on - one situations			0
what else would we look out for ? for a defender , he ’s not exactly goal - shy			0
he ’s already scored twice this season and last year hit one of the goals of the season in the @entity242 , dribbling from inside his own half to score against @entity244			0
can he cut it at the top ? yes , at least according to @entity247			0
the former @entity175 star says @entity161 can potentially be ‘ the best central defender in @entity249 in the next few years			2
’ @entity161 's career path @entity221 ( 2010 - 2013 ) games 62 goals 7 @entity4 ( 2013 - present ) games 42 goals 5 @entity10 says claims that @entity0 are sitting on a huge ' cash pile ' are ' quite untrue ' @entity256 injury : knee out for ? just back in training @entity256 has been out since january but should return to competitive action soon @entity261 injury : hamstring out for ? in training on monday @entity0 received a boost with @entity261 set to return to training on monday @entity266 injury : hamstring out for ? in training next week @entity266 is out of action with a hamstring complaint but is also set to rejoin training @entity77 injury : ankle out for ? eight weeks @entity77 started his @entity0 career well but fell awkwardly on his ankle against @entity276 @entity75 injury : achilles out for ? unspecified @entity279 injury : ankle out for ? eight weeks @entity279 's ankle injury ( against @entity283 ) lead to @entity8 signing @entity284 on deadline day @entity287 injury : knee out for ? just back in training talented youngster @entity287 is back in training after suffering with a knee injury @entity293 injury : thigh out for ? unspecified @entity296 has only played for @entity0 twice but is already missing with a thigh problem and this one is banned ... @entity79 returns next week @entity299 defender @entity79 is unavailable for the game against @entity29 due to a suspension @entity302 to search for defensive cover			1

@entity7 took place at the @entity31 on thursday
@entity10 denies that @entity0 are sitting on a ' cash pile '
@entity8 says they will look to *buy* in january , possibly a defender
@entity170 understands @entity3 was subject of deadline day bid
@entity0 could return for @entity4 star , with several key players out
