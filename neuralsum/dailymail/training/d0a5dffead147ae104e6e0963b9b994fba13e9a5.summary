@entity1 clubs spent an eye - watering £ 115 million on payments to agents in relation to deals that happened in the last two transfer windows according to official figures just released			1
four clubs spent eight - figure sums each , with @entity11 spending more than anyone - £ 16,7771,328 - followed by @entity12 on £ 14,308,444 , @entity13 on £ 12,811,946 and @entity14 on £ 10,983,011			1
to put these astonishing sums into perspective , those four clubs alone have spent as much on middle - men payments in the past year than every club in @entity19 spend on their entire wage bills in a season			1
@entity11 spent £ 32 million on @entity22 in the summer ... but his 11 goals may prove that he was worth it @entity26 supporters unveiled a banner aimed at @entity11 owner @entity28 in october 1st : @entity11 - £ 16,771,328 2nd : @entity12 – £ 14,308,444 3rd : @entity13 – £ 12,811,946 4th : @entity14 – £ 10,983,011 5th : @entity29 – £ 7,975,556 6th : @entity30 – £ 6,380,339 7th : @entity31 – £ 5,753,269 8th : @entity32 – £ 5,276,674 9th : @entity33 – £ 4,293,407 10th : @entity34 – £ 3,986,850 11th : @entity35 – £ 3,876,250 12th : @entity36 – £ 3,784,090 13th : @entity37 – £ 3,493,745 14th : @entity38 – £ 3,242,668 15th : @entity39 – £ 2,766,444 16th : @entity40 – £ 2,577,866 17th : @entity41 – £ 2,459,010 18th : @entity26 – £ 2,200,797 19th : @entity42 – £ 1,608,418 20th : @entity43 – £ 711,024 total – £ 115,261,136 @entity43 spent the least on agents , with £ 711,024 , and then @entity42 on £ 1,608,418			1
@entity26 , @entity41 , @entity40 and @entity39 all spent less than £ 3m			0
the accompanying table shows the payments made by each @entity1 club to agents in the period 1 october 2013 to 30 september 2014			1
the amounts shown include payments made by clubs on behalf of players			0
the @entity1 has been publishing agents ' fees in the name of transparency since the 2009 - 10 season onwards			2
the figures give an insight into the considerable sums that middle - men take out of the game for brokering deals			0
@entity11 may well argue that paying agents helped them to a stellar transfer window in which they signed stars including @entity22 and @entity67 - and still made a small profit on their dealings ! ( before agents ' fees )			2
@entity12 spent £ 117m on players including the @entity39 trio of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
@entity12 , like @entity13 , also bought a player with third - party ownership issues that needed to be resolved and inevitably needed to pay fees to help sort that out			2
@entity79 was the player in question for @entity12			0
at @entity13 , it was @entity82 , who cost the club around £ 40m to three third - party owners ( contrary to the widely reported but erroneous figure of £ 32m )			0
@entity82 's agent in that deal was ' super agent ' @entity88			0
he is the epitome of the monied middle - man			0
as @entity92 exclusively revealed earlier this year , @entity88 has traded players worth more than £ 1 billion in his career - and pocketed fees of £ 100m - plus in commissions - including from several @entity1 clubs for deals included in today 's new figures			1
@entity73 poses with a @entity12 shirt after completing his £ 23m move from @entity39 in the summer @entity43 and @entity42 bought @entity102 ( left ) and @entity103 ( right ) respectively in the summer , but they make up the bottom two in the payments to agents table			1

@entity11 spent the most on agents between october 2013 - september 2014
@entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 make up the rest of the *top* four
the £ 115 million paid by @entity1 clubs is more than every side in @entity19 spend on their entire wage bills in a season
@entity43 were bottom of the pile with £ 711,024 , followed by @entity42
