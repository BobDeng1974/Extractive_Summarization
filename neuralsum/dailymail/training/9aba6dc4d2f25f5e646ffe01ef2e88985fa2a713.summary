an @entity1 couple who became trapped in @entity2 with their newborn twins following changes to the country 's commercial surrogacy laws have finally arrived back home in @entity1			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 on @entity13 's mid-north coast , landed at @entity15 airport with their twin daughters on tuesday morning to a crowd of waiting friends and family			1
@entity21 and @entity22 were born on july 22 in @entity23 to a @entity2 surrogate mother			1
but due to changes to @entity2 surrogacy laws when the twins were born , the couple were unable to bring the girls home until they had a court order granting consent from the birth mother			1
' it 's such a relief to finally be home , ' mr @entity10 told the @entity49			2
the couple had spent more than $ 100,000 and six years trying to start a family and turned to @entity2 surrogacy as a last resort after numerous failed @entity54 attempts in @entity1			2
@entity35 and @entity21 were born just weeks before the horrific story of baby @entity56 emerged and shocked the world			1
@entity56 , also a twin , was born to a @entity2 surrogate mother , @entity58 , but was allegedly abandoned by his @entity1 parents because he had down syndrome			1
@entity56 's biological father @entity61 later revealed in a @entity63 interview he would have terminated the embryo had he discovered the child 's @entity60 sooner , saying : ' no parent wants a son with a disability '			0
the couple turned to a @entity2 surrogate after failed @entity54 attempts in @entity1			2
they were stranded in a @entity2 motel with their newborn girls for a month mr @entity10 had earlier explained that they could not simply bring their children home to @entity1 now , despite having all the required @entity1 documentation			2
' our twin girls have all their relevant paperwork ( @entity1 citizenship , @entity1 passports ) , ' he said			0
' before the @entity2 army cracked down on commercial surrogacy on the twins birthday ( 22/7/2014 ) you could just leave the country without anyone batting an eyelid with your new family			1
' now its a different story , now its considered " human trafficking " because they see it as though we are stealing someones children , and if they ask to see babies ' birth certificate that is proof because our surrogate 's name is on certificate as their mother			0
' we had @entity102 tests done and our babies are our babies and in no way , shape or form are related to birth mother ( our surrogate )			0
so we have to go through the courts now and get a court order to leave the country			2
' at the end of july the laws radically changed to mean parents of surrogate children born in the country can no longer leave @entity2 with their children without a court order the @entity11 couple posted photos of their baby girls from the @entity2 motel room they were staying in friends of @entity10 and mrs @entity22 had set up a fundraising page to raise money to pay for new flights home and their unexpectedly long stay in @entity2			1
when the couple and their daughters arrived home on tuesday , more than $ 8,000 had been raised			0
the couple have reportedly signed a deal with @entity132 to tell their story on the @entity134 , the @entity49 reports			0
mr @entity10 explained that they could not simply bring their children home to @entity1 , despite having all the required @entity1 documentation a statement from the @entity1 @entity138 , regarding @entity1 parents being prevented from bringing their children home from @entity2 , said : ' we have been advised that @entity2 authorities may enforce enhanced documentation requirements when exiting the country , when they suspect a child has been born by surrogacy in @entity2			1
' the @entity148 's @entity147 website was updated on 14 august to reflect these requirements			0
' we strongly urge @entity150 entering @entity2 for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both @entity2 and @entity1 before doing so			0
in particular , they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements			0
' while regulation of surrogacy in @entity2 is a matter for @entity2 , we continue to encourage @entity2 authorities to adopt appropriate transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce , so concerned @entity150 are not unduly affected			0
' @entity163 and @entity61 caused international outrage by abandoning baby @entity56 , who has down syndrome , in @entity2 while taking his sister @entity166 ( pictured ) home to @entity1			1

@entity9 and @entity10 were trapped in @entity2 with their newborn twins following changes to surrogacy laws
