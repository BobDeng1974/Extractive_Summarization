he accepted the misdemeanor conviction to avoid trial on charges of taking ' indecent liberties ' with a 17 - year - old , child pornography and soliciting a minor — felonies that could have put him in prison for decades and caused the automatic loss of his legislative position			0

time out : technically the most junior member of the @entity24 because of his resignation and re-election , @entity7 has been moved to a desk in a far corner of the chamber but that spectacle and the conviction were not enough to derail his candidacy in a district where he has repeatedly captured at least 70 percent of the vote			1
@entity7 's supporters , and the delegate himself , attribute his popularity to his attention to constituent service in black - majority district where voters feel their voices are not heard by the political establishment at the @entity25			1
' we compare him to @entity199 , ' the charismatic former @entity194 mayor who was elected to a fourth term after serving prison time for a drug offense , @entity7 supporter @entity192 said in an interview before the latest charges were divulged			2
' he had issues but was always there and could be counted on			0
