justification : @entity1 has written to the @entity2 justifying the @entity4 's investigation and methods the officer in charge of @entity9 ’s inquiries in the wake of the phone - hacking scandal has been forced to defend her force ’s tactics			1
questions have been raised over the scope of @entity16 , the multi-million pound criminal inquiry into alleged bribes paid by journalists to public officials , after it targeted police officers who have ‘ leaked ’ information with no payment involved			1
those concerns follow mounting controversy over the dawn arrests of journalists – including an ex-editor who was seven months pregnant – and reporters left facing many months before discovering whether they will face charges			0
the arrests have also prompted fears , after the @entity35 inquiry , that informal contact between police officers and the @entity38 is being outlawed			0
now assistant commissioner @entity1 has written to the @entity2 justifying the @entity4 ’s investigations and methods			1
in her unsolicited letter explaining the @entity43 operation she insists : ‘ the investigations being carried out do not mean that the @entity4 wants or intends to stop officers talking to journalists			1
’ defending the much - criticised ‘ 7am door knocks ’ , miss @entity1 says there are ‘ sound operational reasons for the times of day we elect to arrest people ’			2
miss @entity1 said there was ‘ genuine concern ’ by police over the time those arrested have been on bail but said there have been ‘ millions of emails , documentation , complex communications data and trails of financial transactions that require painstaking analysis ’			2
she concluded : ‘ an unintended and , i hope , short - term consequence of this may be a negative effect on relations between police and journalists			0
‘ this is unfortunate but in no way undermines the value the @entity4 puts on the role of a free and investigative @entity38 in a democratic society – indeed this investigation is the result of such journalism			1
we want open , professional and trusting relationships between our officers and journalists			0
’ @entity85 , executive director of the @entity2 , said : ‘ while i am glad she has recognised the need to give an explanation , areas of concern remain			0
‘ we should all recognise that the police sometimes have a difficult job to do , but early - morning knocks on the doors of journalists still require some justification			0
