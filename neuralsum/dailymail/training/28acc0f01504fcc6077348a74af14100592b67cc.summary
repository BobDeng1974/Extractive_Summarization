electronic cigarette makers are in a race to design and buy new variations of the technology after becoming a billion - dollar industry			1
@entity5 is the front runner in the manufacture and development of so - called e-cigarette technology , as it 's a country with over 300 million smokers			1
new versions being patented include a ' pay as you go ' computer - assisted device and others that can deliver caffeine instead			1
in 2005 just eight e-cigarette inventions were described in published patents			1
by 2012 the figure had jumped to 220			0
in 2005 just eight e-cigarette inventions were described in published patents ... but by 2012 the figure had jumped to 220 ( stock image ) by last year there were over 500 inventions , according to an analysis by the @entity25 business of @entity26			2
so far this year the total has reached 650			0
( a single invention may be covered by several patents			0
) the original technology , involving battery - powered heating systems that vaporise nicotine - laced liquid , is credited to @entity33 , a @entity5 medical researcher with a 20 - a - day habit , in 2003			1
his invention has since become so popular that the market is now estimated to be worth $ 3.5 billion			1
both big tobacco firms and small entrepreneurs are falling over themselves to find new ways to ' vape ' - a verb suddenly so mainstream the @entity43 named it 2014 's @entity45			2
@entity46 last year snapped up the patents owned by the company @entity48 co-founded in a deal worth $ 75 million , and is suing rivals for a range of alleged patent infringements			1
part of the rush to create new devices can be explained by the prospect of stiffer regulation on existing ones after the @entity59 said it wanted to see this , along with bans on indoor use , advertising and sales to minors			0
while proponents see e-cigarettes as important tools for harm reduction , critics fear the devices may instead fuel a new wave of nicotine addiction and cite a lack of long - term scientific evidence to support their safety			2
of more than 2,000 e-cigarette inventions tracked by @entity26 , 64 percent originate in @entity5 , where over half of men smoke			1
in second place is the @entity80 , with 14 percent , followed by @entity81 with 9 percent			0
some patented suggestions target smokers looking to regulate their nicotine intake and their spending			2
while offerings already on the market include thousands of e-liquid flavours from menthol to marshmallow , and even a smartphone app to show how much you are using , new patents go a step further			2
tobacco giant @entity95 describes an e-cigarette that would allow users to ' pay as you go ' by buying a certain number of doses via computer application connected to their e-cigarette			2
this graphic shows the invention boom of the e-cigarette from the year 2000 to 2014 customers could also programme the device to shut off after a certain number of puffs per use to help limit intake			0
other smaller players aim to deliver doses of caffeine and other additives instead of nicotine			0
a unit of @entity117 sells @entity118 containing vitamins and supplements such as valerian and collagen , while a company called @entity124 sells a caffeinated vaping stick			0
patents filed by others , including @entity128 , mention tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity130 ) , the active chemical in cannabis			0
in general , e-cigarette patents relate to systems for heating and vaporising liquids , as well as for charging the electronic systems , whether in a ' cigalike ' device or a larger ' tank ' system , which does n't resemble a cigarette but gives a better ' vaping ' experience			0
@entity5 's domination of the market reflects not only its huge number of smokers but also a wider drive by the @entity5 government to forge a knowledge economy			1
by maximising patents it hopes to replace the ubiquitous ' made in @entity5 ' label by ' designed in @entity5			0
' since 2011 , @entity5 has been the world 's top patent filer for all inventions , according to the @entity156			1
its scientists and companies now lay claim to intellectual property rights on everything from telecoms to medicine			0
' patenting globally is rising significantly year on year , driven by @entity5 patenting generally , ' said @entity165 , senior patent analyst at @entity166			1
' but i would say the e-cigarette field is growing faster than the general trend , and the bias toward @entity5 is greater than in global patenting			1

the e-cigarette market is now estimated to be worth $ 3.5 billion
@entity5 is the front runner in manufacturing and developing e-cigarettes - and the country has over 300 million smokers
since 2011 , @entity5 has been the world 's top patent filer for all inventions
new ideas being patented include ' pay as you go ' and caffeine sticks
