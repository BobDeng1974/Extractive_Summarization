click here to read @entity2 's match report from the @entity3 @entity4 had just received a pass from @entity6 and , as he took possession , @entity8 began scampering down the flank			1
to get @entity10 firmly on the front foot , all @entity4 had to do was take control and usher the ball out wide			2
the @entity14 tried to run through the middle on his own but the ball became stuck between his feet and @entity18 defender @entity17 comfortably dispossessed him			2
on the touchline , @entity19 went berserk			0
flinging his arms out , hollering at @entity4 and asking for an explanation as to why a promising attack had so needlessly fallen down , he left his new £ 16million striker aware of his displeasure			0
@entity10 manager @entity19 ( c ) raises his arms in frustration as a @entity10 move breaks down @entity4 was a target for his manager 's anger during the @entity32 group a defeat @entity19 was left frustrated by @entity10 's failure to reach the standards they set last season yet this was not an isolated incident			1
moments later , when @entity39 dithered and surrendered the ball , @entity19 again let rip , leaving the @entity41 with no ambiguity over how disappointed he was to see another break go askew			0
it became a recurring theme			0
tugging at the jacket of his black suit , folding his arms firmly and shuffling from side to side , @entity19 ’ frustration at watching @entity10 fail to get near the breathless standards they set last season became more apparent with each passing second in @entity53			1
having masterminded one of the most exciting campaigns in the club ’s recent history , @entity19 is impatient for his new look team to reach the levels that saw them pummel opponents to submission before they even realised what was happening			2
‘ we ’ve not made as good a start as we would have wanted but there are a number of reasons why , ’ @entity19 had explained when arriving in @entity18 on tuesday			2
‘ we are integrating new players to a new culture and we ’ve had injuries to key players			0
we have a big vision and an idea where we are going			0
’ @entity19 barks orders at defender @entity76 as @entity10 's defence struggles yet again @entity10 captain @entity78 ( c ) looks over to @entity19 as the team struggle to find their fluency @entity19 cut an agitated figure from the sidelines as he watched his game plan fail against the @entity84 much to his consternation , however , it is not happening how he wants it to			1
the rhythm and the swagger is missing from their attack but , most worryingly , the defence continues to be @entity10 ’s biggest flaw and the concession of another soft goal prompted @entity19 ’ most colourful reaction			1
after @entity97 had gleefully pounced on a loose ball in the six - yard area to put @entity18 in control of the game , @entity19 spun on his heels , scrunched up his face and mouthed his displeasure to his assistants @entity105 and @entity107			1
@entity19 could contend – just – with @entity10 lacking fluency going forward if things were solid at the back but their inability to keep a clean sheet is becoming more and more problematic and it is going to leave them with mountains to climb , both at home and in @entity115			1
in five of their last six games , they have conceded goals that can be kindly described as cheap and it says everything for the state of flux that @entity10 have only kept one clean sheet in their nine fixtures in all competitions			0
it is not good enough			0
@entity10 's defence is still a major cause for concern as they conceded another cheap goal @entity18 's @entity97 wheels away after scoring the match winning goal against @entity10 @entity10 players trudge off dejectedly after conceding the goal that dents their @entity32 hopes to progress in @entity115 , teams first and foremost have to be solid and difficult to break down			1
one bad night and all the hard work will be brought crashing down to earth and this latest disjointed rear - guard performance has thrown @entity140 wide open			0
@entity10 now face a double - header against @entity142 , arguably the most dazzling attacking unit in world football , and if they play as they have been , they will be stuck on three points with two games to go , away to @entity147 ( november 26 ) before hosting @entity18 on december 9			1
tradition demands that @entity10 extricate themselves from difficult positions and their @entity115 history is filled with glorious come - from - behind moments			2
history , though , will not save them this time if @entity19 does not find a cure for his side ’s back ache .			0

@entity10 lost 1 - 0 to @entity18 in their @entity32 group b clash
@entity97 scored a *scrappy* winning goal at the @entity3
@entity19 was frustrated by @entity162 ' inability to reach the standards set last season
@entity10 's defence is s still a major cause for concern for the manager
