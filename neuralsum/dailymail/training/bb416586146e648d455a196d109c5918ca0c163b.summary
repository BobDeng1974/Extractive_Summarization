cybernetic arms , unicorns , cupcakes and women turning into huge spiders are but a few of @entity7 's quirky delights			0
but this is no surprise given that it 's developed by @entity9 , popularly known as @entity9 - the outlandish mind behind the acclaimed @entity11 and @entity12			1
but to say @entity7 is in the same league would be inaccurate - due to some missteps in the gameplay and graphics departments			2
not a sight for sore eyes : there is something impressive about the style , but the colour scheme is way off you play @entity24 , a pencil - thin assassin and womaniser who wakes up to find he has a cybernetic arm ( as you do )			1
@entity24 and his annoying assistant @entity27 then join the @entity28 - where a lady called @entity30 sends him on missions to destroy monsters and a muscled man called @entity34 smokes cigars			1
then there 's the gameplay , which plays in a similar way to @entity39			0
you 're encouraged to mix light and heavy attacks , and can use your cybernetic arm to fire different types of ammunition - ranging from bullets to a freeze ray			2
sadly , it 's incredibly repetitive and extremely easy - and although you can accumulate enough ' blood ' to unleash a devastating execution move - the limited repertoire of finishers grates by the end of the game			1
@entity24 's inability to jump , too , is a bizarre decision especially given the multi-layered level design			2
visually the game is incredibly inconsistent			2
the colour pallet really is n't for everyone 's tastes - and while environments are varied - ranging from an oversized candy house to the @entity62 - the colour choice looks deeply unpleasant at times			1
fans of @entity9 may find the dialogue amusing , the main vehicle for humour being @entity27			1
but for most , she will soon become incredibly tiresome - an annoyance who 's so desperate for attention that it ultimately takes away from what little narrative there is			1
in - game and texture quality has been sacrificed to keep the framerate smooth - and to its credit , there 's almost no slowdown even during the game 's more demanding boss sections			1
where @entity7 claws back a points is away from the action			0
there are inventive mini games where you have to impress women one minute or run over as many enemies with a motorbike as possible the next			0
there are also moments during the cinematics that are beautifully directed			0
a shot where @entity24 is running across the surface of the @entity62 is particularly memorable			0
as is an early scene involving @entity34 and a killer you execute			0
@entity100 : there are some memorable moments away from the campaign , such as trying to help @entity104 woo women , but the bread and butter gameplay is n't as challenging as it should be and soon gets repetitive alas , for the most part , @entity7 is forgettable			0
and although hardcore @entity9 fans may find some solace here , it will be too obscure for many			1
killer is dead is out on friday august 30			0
disagree with @entity112 ? let us know what you think on @entity116 : @ @entity117 and on @entity118 : @entity119 .			0

bizarre colour palette , narrative and overall presentation
solid fighting *mechanics* backed up with an impressive framerate
inconsistent *standard* of voice - acting and @entity27 , your assistant , grates
fans of @entity9 may find some solace here
