a tongue - in - cheek video welcoming the @entity2 international delegates to @entity3 makes fun of the @entity7 host city 's unused infrastructure , elderly demographic and slow @entity10 services to name but a few			1
the hilarious parody , posted by comedy group @entity13 , opens with ' you might be looking out your hotel window wondering , " is this it ? " yes			1
' and then goes on to have a dig at the large percentage of retirees who have chose @entity3 as their home to see out their twilight years			2
' but before you judge our town , we 'd like to let you know that we 're actually the number one choice for retirement of women 66 to 67 years of age with family in the area			0

' the city 's infrastructure cops a beating with the @entity47 motorway - ' named after how many cars have used it '			1
the $ 3.2billion tolled bypass tunnel that runs under the @entity3 river , was suggested as ' somewhere nice and quiet ' to hold a business meeting			2
the adventurous types can always tackle @entity3 's iconic @entity53 : ' it 's the second - best bridge climb in the country , of both available			1
' - the other being , of course , one of @entity59 's most famous landmarks - the @entity60			2
fun is also poked at the money spent on the bikes available for people to use to get around the city			0
' although they are four years old , they 've been kept in such great condition			0
look at this one , it looks like it 's never been used before ! ' one comedian says			0
' over the years @entity3 has played host to long list of world events ' as this graph clearly illustrates delegates are then told to utilise the world class internet speeds labelling the network as ' some of the best in the world ' as the video starts to drops out of range			1
the most hysterical part of the two - minute skit is when one comedian points out that ' over the years @entity3 has played host to long list of world events ' as a graph shows that since the city 's declaration in 1902 - the only world event it has hosted is @entity93 which occurred in 1988			1
the video appropriately ends with a line that sums up the whole point of making the video : ' we hope you enjoy your time in @entity3 - we maybe a small city ... thank you			1
' for more on @entity13 go to their @entity102 and @entity103 pages ' although they are four years old , they 've been kept in such great condition			0
look at this one , it looks like it 's never been used before ! ' - the comedian says about the bikes to the right of him			0
