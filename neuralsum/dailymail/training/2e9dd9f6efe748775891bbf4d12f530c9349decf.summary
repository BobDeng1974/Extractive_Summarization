by @entity0 a classified @entity2 report found that the @entity4 's legal justification for the use of harsh interrogation techniques that critics say amount to torture was based on faulty legal reasoning , mcclatchy news service reported on thursday			1
the @entity4 also issued erroneous claims about how many people it subjected to techniques such as simulated drowning , or ' water boarding , ' according to the news service , citing conclusions from the @entity21 report obtained by @entity11			1
the report also concluded that the @entity4 used interrogation methods that were not approved by its own headquarters or the @entity25 , impeded @entity27 oversight and actively evaded oversight both by @entity29 and its own inspector general			1
the @entity4 also provided false information to the @entity25 , which used that information to conclude that the methods would not break the law because those applying them did not specifically intend to inflict severe pain or suffering , the report added			1

' the report 's findings appear to show that the @entity4 systematically misled @entity29 , the @entity27 , and the @entity25 about its brutal and unlawful interrogation program , ' said @entity58 , senior counsel at @entity59 in @entity60			1
' how does it make sense for the president to allow the @entity4 to take charge of declassifying a report that shows unlawful and embarrassing conduct on its part ? ' she asked in a statement responding to the @entity11 report			2
@entity4 spokesman @entity70 told @entity71 he could not comment because the report is still classified			1

' the vote to lift the blackout on the summary and recommendations of the 6,200 - page report followed an unprecedented clash between @entity96 and the @entity4			2
@entity96 accused the agency of spying on @entity97 committee staff who compiled it and the @entity4 accused staff members of illegally obtaining @entity4 documents			0
the massive undertaking has also caused tensions between @entity97 on the intelligence committee , who conducted the report , and some committee republicans , who said they considered the process politicized and the report biased			0
