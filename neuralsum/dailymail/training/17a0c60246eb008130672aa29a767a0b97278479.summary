by @entity0 sorry sisters , but the double - standard reaction to ‘ women eating on @entity4 ’ shows exactly how hypocritical – and humourless – feminism can be			1
after 48 hours of brow - beating and trolling , @entity7 ’s feminist community are hoping that a fun , irreverent , tongue - in - cheek blog about ladies masticating in public will be removed from the internet			1
the women who eat on tubes group , which was set - up in 2011 and has more than 21,000 members , has sparked controversy in recent days with opponents claiming it encourages people to ‘ objectify and humiliate women ’ who are unaware their picture is being taken			1
the women who eat on tubes group , which was set - up in 2011 and has more than 21,000 members , has sparked controversy film - maker @entity28 , who set up the @entity31 page in 2011 , has insisted it was created as a ' human observation ' that more women ate on the tube than men and he had not intended to hurt anybody			1
a @entity39 spokesman has since admitted that three people have contacted them about the group , including one woman who had her picture posted online			1
speaking to @entity45 , mr @entity28 , 39 , said he is now weighing up whether to shut down the page due to the ' constant barrage of toxic hatred ' on social media			1
' i 'm considering taking the group down , ' he said			1
' i need to think about it carefully			0
i do n't want to be seen to be backing down but i need to think about my family			0
‘ there are more important things to think about			0
' and he ’s right – there are much bigger fish to fry			0
one example is @entity60 : a website which has encouraged women to objectify men on the @entity64 without their knowledge for more than three years			1
when it became a global sensation in 2011 , it was lauded as a peak - time pastime by everything from @entity71 to the @entity72 , who wrote a gushing feature about it , claiming : ‘ flirty females are using their smartphones to capture the dishiest of the @entity64 's two million daily commuters , and uploading the unsuspecting men onto hit website @entity80			1
‘ the cute commuters are then rated and commented on by admiring women - with surveys taken as to which tube lines have the hottest men ( so far , overwhelmingly , the @entity87 is winning )			1
women who eat on @entity90 founder says he is considering taking down the @entity31 group film - maker @entity28 , who set up the @entity31 page women who eat on tubes in 2011 , has insisted it was created as a ' human observation ' that more women ate on the tube than men and he had not intended to hurt anybody here we had women taking pictures of men based on their looks , their muscles and the bulge in their trousers – with the sole intention of humiliating them			1
disturbingly , some of the lads in the photographs did n’t always look old enough to be sixteen , while others – wearing shorts in the summer - were snapped sitting down as the material rode up their legs			1
i could n’t help but wonder : how desperate were these sad women ? given that this all started happening at a time when a record number of female teachers were sleeping with male minors ( and , of course , frequently avoiding jail ) this was hardly something to encourage			2
shortly after the advent of @entity60 , another blog called ‘ men taking up too much space on the train ’ was launched - and hailed as hilarious			2
one chauvinistic columnist in @entity134 even celebrated it by saying : ‘ i love it			0
now when will there be one about men taking up too much space in the world ? ’ writer @entity0 strongly advocates boy power soon after , when @entity144 actor @entity143 used the @entity145 and sat with his legs slightly apart for comfort , one woman publicly demanded he be – and i quote – ‘ castrated			1
' hilariously , when the tables are turned – even in a way that is utterly non-sexual and non-violent – it ’s considered misogynistic			0
ok , had @entity28 ’s blog been the first - of - a - kind , i would probably agree that it was violating with a little ‘ v. ' i would also wonder whether it stemmed from casual , everyday sexism			2
but , given that these women started it all , they ’ve got no right to complain			2
sure , they think they ’re redressing an age - old imbalance of being found attractive by heterosexual men , but objectification is nothing new for both genders			2
in fact , women frequently objectify men via their wallets			2
if they are sex objects , then men are success objects			0
now , thanks to @entity60 , they ’re also being leered at by peeping toms in pencil skirts			0
but , as @entity60 is about to re-launch with a bigger and ‘ better ’ site , how can men take action ? the answer : turn the tables and play them at their own game			0
i was once travelling on the @entity87 when a young woman was trying to surreptitiously take a photograph of a man in a suit			0
hilariously , her flash went off – at which point he started filming her with plans to put the footage on @entity194 - which caused her to scurry off at the next stop in shame			2
that ’s because what he did is exactly what the @entity202 blog does – it holds a mirror up to double standards and levels the playing field			1
it takes away the thrill of it all , which – in women ’s case – is objectifying without being objectified			2
the same thing happened when a bunch of female law students from @entity217 recreated the @entity219 video for @entity220 with men in pants			0
it was the best way to make their point			0
but , given that countless feminists have been unable to recognise this , what can we all learn from from this week ’s furore ? mainly , that feminism – for all its gains , for all its back - patting – is still marred by sexist double - standards			1
on the one hand we ’re told that women must be treated equally to men , but when they are – for good and bad - they do n’t like it			1
quite frankly , they ’ve got off lightly			0
imagine if , like millions of @entity7 men , women were routinely denied access to their children in a divorce			2
or if schools were failing girls more than any other social group			1
or if 99 per cent of the war dead were female			0
or if women died ten years earlier than men because the @entity248 did n’t dole out equal funding			2
guys taking pictures of women on the underground is nothing in comparison			0
it also is n’t sexist or sinister , but simply boy power			0
normally , i ’d dread travelling by the tube at rush hour : there ’s always some wretch who stands on my @entity267 brogues or a tourist with no sense of spacial awareness			0
or , worse , a teenage girl who thinks she deserves to be given a seat by an old man simply because she ’s female			0
but , now , my journey will take on a whole new level of enjoyment , because – just like women across @entity64 – i ’ll also board the love train with my camera at the ready			0
is n’t equality wonderful ? follow @entity0 on @entity281 at @ handsomecopy			1
