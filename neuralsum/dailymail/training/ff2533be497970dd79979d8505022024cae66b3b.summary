building an interstellar spacecraft that can take humans beyond the solar system might sound like something out of a sci - fi film - but one organisation has plans to do just that in the next 100 years			1
designers claim that in order to do so , we ’ll need to build ‘ living worldships ’ akin to @entity12 that are entirely self - sustainable			2
these ships could then be used to rescue and house the human population in the event of a global catastrophe , for example			0
new research suggests that if we want to achieve interstellar travel we will need to build self - sustainable ' living worldships ' that can support multiple generations of humans			1
these ships could also be used to rescue the human population in the event of a global catastrophe , for example			0
artist 's impression is pictured @entity29 , the research is looking at how a long - duration manned mission out of the solar system could feasibly survive			1
the conclusion is that any future ‘ generation ship ’ we build will need to be entirely self - sustainable in terms of not only food and water , but cultural advances as well			2
in essence , any manned vehicle we one day send into interstellar space will need a ' flourishing ecosystem '			2
@entity29 is a study for @entity45 - a non-profit organisation hoping to one day enable human interstellar spaceflight through their one hundred year starship project			1
this is a joint project run by @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity45 and the @entity51			1
announced in january 2012 , it has the goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112			2
to do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies , including ‘ warping ’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at faster - than - light speeds			2
the project is also considering building ‘ generation ships ’ that move slowly but have a self - sustainable long - term population			1
to date @entity50 has contributed $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) to the project and @entity49 $ 1 million ( £ 600,000 )			1
it is the belief of @entity68 , and other agencies and organisations , that humanity can build a ‘ worldship ’ in 100 years that will take a large group of people on a mission beyond the solar system			1
this could be a so - called generation ship , with multiple generations of humans living aboard the vessel on its journey into deep space and back again			2
to make such a mission possible would require an initiative such as @entity29 , said project leader @entity86 , a senior architecture and design lecturer at the @entity89			1
‘ @entity29 is the living interior of a worldship , ’ @entity90 tells @entity91			0
‘ we ’re not trying to just take stuff from @entity96 and put it in a giant pot , it ’s about how do we design an environment within a closed system			0
‘ so , could we grow an ecosystem from scratch ? ’ @entity90 ’s research suggests that if we do build an interstellar spaceship within 100 years - which she is fairly certain we will - the ship itself will need to be like a @entity107			1
we will need to take into account soil , weather cycles and other processes that underpin our existence			0
this includes technological advances - the society on the ship will need to be able to anticipate cultural steps that will be occurring on @entity96			0
‘ rather than presupposing what the needs of an interstellar civilization may be within this system , which will experience its own physical and chemical rhythms , @entity29 is approaching the idea of a living space within a worldship by taking a bottom - up approach to its construction , ' @entity90 writes in her research			1
‘ by understanding the basic physical and chemical interactions that may spontaneously form systems that shape the flow of matter through the worldship , it may be possible to create events within them such as , growth and decomposition , around which human activity can thrive			0
’ in @entity90 's research she has been studying artificial soils for interstellar spacecraft including @entity142 3 , pictured , which uses activated gel and inorganic salts to move substances through a matrix the worldship , artist 's impression pictured , could be built from space junk in order to grow its living interior - a unique kind of space ecology			1
the spaceship would also gather asteroids in order to aid its sustainability ‘ paradoxically on @entity96 we have ruined the most fertile soils by building cities , so essentially the idea is to see what kind of life a space soil might support , ’ explained @entity90			2
‘ we kind of understand the speculative nature of this project but it ’s about understanding the broad questions			0
’ the aim is to build such an interstellar spaceship in a century although , admitted @entity90 : ‘ whether that ’s achievable i do n’t know			0
’ but , as @entity90 pointed out , it is not only private organisations like @entity45 that are researching ambitious projects like this			0
in the @entity177 , @entity49 and @entity50 are working on the same @entity178 ( @entity178 ) project with the goal of taking humans outside the solar system in 100 years			1
‘ i think the consensus for the next generation of space vessels is 100 years , ’ said @entity90			1
‘ whether we ’ll have a full starship or not depends on funding , technological progress and cultural support for these kinds of projects			0
’ @entity90 added that , in order to keep continued support , some of the technology designed for these ‘ starship cities ’ could be transferred into modern cities			0
this would allow the public to see useful applications deriving from such research			0
future living worldships will need to make use of resources in their environment in order to survive			0
this could include utilising asteroids and space junk to ensure the ship is self - sustainable			2
an artist 's impression of this kind of ship is pictured			0

building self - sustainable spacecraft is the *key* to interstellar travel
that 's according to @entity86 , the lead on @entity29
she said we need to design methods to support space - based ecosystems
this would enable us to travel beyond the solar system in 100 years
the project is part of a study being funded by both @entity50 and @entity49
