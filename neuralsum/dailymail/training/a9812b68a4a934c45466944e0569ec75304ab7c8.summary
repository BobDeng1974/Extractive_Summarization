thousands of @entity1 patients suffering from chronic pain and fatigue could be misdiagnosed with psychological problems when they unknowingly have a type of brain damage			1
those people who complain of the symptoms are not given a series of blood tests that can pinpoint the problem , meaning the true cause is not spotted			1
patients are then condemned to years of misery and ineffective therapies			2
the major cause of the damage is head injury , which can be relatively mild			1
however , viruses , tumours and even animal bites can be a trigger			0
@entity23 , who died in 2011 , was incorrectly diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome when in fact she was suffering from a brain damage called hypopituitarism the @entity28 was considering including the condition – called post-traumatic hypopituitarism ( @entity31 ) – in its most recent guidance to doctors on how to treat head injury			1
it would have meant patients who turned up at @entity38 departments or gp surgeries with head injuries would be warned that the symptoms of @entity31 – which also include depression , obesity , high blood pressure , loss of libido and even infertility – could take years to emerge			1
however , when the new recommendations were published in the spring , there was no mention of the problem			0
the decision has been condemned as ‘ nonsensical ’ by an expert who treats @entity31			1
currently , patients who present with tiredness and chronic pain are often told they have chronic fatigue syndrome ( @entity58 ) , or fibromyalgia , once other physical causes have been ruled out			1
they are offered psychotherapy , exercise and antidepressants			0
however , these are currently found to be ineffective in up to 70 per cent of @entity58 cases			1
numerous studies have shown that between 20 and 30 per cent of the 135,000 patients who suffer a serious head injury also experience damage to the pituitary gland , which is situated below the brain , behind the nasal cavity			1
problem area : the size of the pituitary gland and delay of symptoms means the bran damage is often misdiagnosed as a psychological problem the gland produces vital hormones that govern many bodily functions , including growth and repair , the sleep - wake cycle and how we react to stress			1
if the pea - sized organ is damaged , it may stop producing one or more of the essential hormones , triggering the wide - ranging symptoms of hypopituitarism			1
studies suggest there could be between 18,000 and 30,000 cases in the @entity1 each year			0
treatment involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy , which is said to be highly effective but costs up to £ 6,000 a year			0
professor @entity99 , one of @entity1 ’s foremost experts on @entity31 , says : ‘ the overwhelming evidence from research studies carried out independently in a wide range of places , including the @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , is that hypopituitarism occurs in up to 30 per cent of people who have survived moderate or severe traumatic brain injury			1
‘ however , the failure to make the right diagnosis after such injury means patients miss out on essential treatment			1
that it ’s not included in the @entity28 guidelines [ for treatment of head injury ] is nonsensical			1
’ serious head injury is defined as an injury causing unconsciousness for more than 15 minutes			1
however , some studies suggest even knocks that lead to a minor concussion , or repeated small impacts such as heading a football , may damage the pituitary gland			2
@entity31 sufferer @entity130 , 67 , was misdiagnosed with @entity58 in 2006 , having suffered from pain and blood pressure problems for almost 20 years			1
a former @entity135 manager , she was advised to exercise more , but found her condition worsened			0
during her illness , @entity137 was screened for deficiency in the hormone cortisol , a characteristic of hypopituitarism			2
however , the test – known as the short synacthen test ( @entity145 ) – produced a normal result			0
‘ that was when i was told i had @entity58 , ’ she says			1
yet @entity145 misses two of out every five cases where the cause of cortisol deficiency is damage to the pituitary			2
in 2007 , @entity137 came across a magazine article about @entity23 , who was incorrectly diagnosed with @entity58 when in fact she was suffering from hypopituitarism			1
‘ eventually , after huge persistence , @entity23 was able to pay privately for a test which the @entity160 would accept			0
this proved she had been right all along – her pituitary was faulty			0
her story opened my eyes , ’ says @entity137			0
coincidentally , the two women were patients at the same hospital and struck up a friendship			2
@entity137 says : ‘ doctors believe @entity23 ’s hypopituitarism was caused by inflammation – she suffered rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years			2
in 2005 she had a virus that would n’t go , and the fatigue started then			2
’ @entity137 chose to be retested privately with the more reliable glucagon stimulation test , and was diagnosed as being deficient in cortisol and growth hormone			0
this proved she too had hypopituitarism			2
sadly , @entity23 died in july 2011 from complications related to her arthritis treatment , perhaps exacerbated by the fatigue she had suffered for so many years			2
dr @entity183 , consultant endocrinologist at the @entity184 in @entity185 and chairman of the @entity187 , says : ‘ a “ pass ” on an @entity145 may not always mean cortisol deficiency is excluded			0
’ he recommends referral to an endocrinologist if symptoms persist , so that the glucagon test can be carried out			0
today , @entity137 wonders whether a concussion she suffered after jumping off a roundabout as a toddler could have caused the damage			0
now she is having hormone therapy , her symptoms improved			0
last @entity202 she once again had the energy to cook a proper family dinner and put on make - up			0
‘ it sounds silly , ’ she says , ‘ but i had n’t had the energy to do that for years			0
