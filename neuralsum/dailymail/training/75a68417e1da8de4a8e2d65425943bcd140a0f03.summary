later this year , @entity0 plans to perform the first test flight of its heavy - lift rocket , known as the @entity3 , with a view to one day taking astronauts to the moon or @entity7			1
and exactly how the rocket will take flight and return to @entity10 has been detailed in a new promotional video			2
it shows the huge rocket , which will be the most powerful currently in operation , lifting into orbit before its various boosters autonomously land back at the launch pad			1
a video shows it lifting off ( shown ) from a launch pad in @entity23			1
its side boosters and core then land themselves back at the pad			1
@entity0 say reusability is key to keeping launch costs down			1
the @entity3 will be used to take astronauts to the moon and @entity7 the video shows how the @entity3 rocket will take off with four million pounds ( 1.8 million kg ) of thrust from @entity35 at @entity37 ’s @entity36 in @entity23			1
‘ thrust at liftoff is equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft operating simultaneously , ’ according to @entity0			0
the goal of the rocket is to provide a means of lifting large amounts of cargo into space at a relatively low cost			0
it is estimated that each flight of the rocket will eventually cost about £ 56 million ( $ 85 million )			0
height : 224.4ft ( 68.4 metres ) weight : 3.23 million lbs ( 1.46 million kg ) total width : 38ft ( 11.6 metres ) thrust at liftoff : 4 million lbs ( 1.8 million kg ) engines : 27 @entity57 engines lifting capability to low @entity10 orbit : 117,000lbs ( 53,000kg ) lifting capability to geostationary orbit : 47,000lbs ( 21,200kg ) lifting capability to @entity7 : 29,000lbs ( 13,200kg ) expected first launch : mid- 2015 for comparison , @entity37 's comparable @entity63 , which admittedly is more powerful , will cost about £ 330 million ( $ 500 million ) per launch			1
to do this , @entity0 plans to return most of the rocket back to the launchpad , enabling its boosters to be used on multiple flights			2
the rocket is designed with a central core booster that is derived from the smaller falcon 9 rocket - which has already completed many successful flights			0
strapped to either side are two additional @entity77 rocket cores			0
once they have exhausted most of their fuel , the two side boosters are released			2
the video shows how they will then spin around in @entity10 ’s atmosphere and descend in a controlled manner back to @entity10			2
as they descend , landing legs are deployed - and the two boosters land back at the launch pad from where they took off			1
there ’s a bit of artistic licence in the video , though , as it ’s unlikely the boosters would land at the same time - instead touching down probably around 30 seconds apart			0
@entity37 ’s @entity63 ( @entity94 ) lifting capability : 290,000lbs ( 130,000kg ) @entity3 117,000lbs ( 53,000kg ) space shuttle 53,790lbs ( 24,000kg ) @entity97 49,740lbs ( 22,560kg ) @entity98 44,090lbs ( 20,000kg ) @entity99 40,810lbs ( 18,510kg ) the video does highlight , though , how @entity0 will attempt to return their rockets to land - rather than a floating barge , as they recently attempted			1
later in the video , the central core of the rocket is then also brought back to @entity10 , landing near to the other two boosters			2
again , there ’s some artistic licence - ceo @entity110 has previously stated it will be difficult to land the core back on the ground , and instead it will most likely land on a barge in the ocean			1
to get humans to the moon or @entity7 , a huge rocket is needed to lift a large enough space containing the crew , spacecraft and cargo			2
in the days of @entity126 this was the @entity127 - but now @entity0 are working on this new breed of rocket that they say can do comparable missions much more cheaply			0
it is being developed alongside @entity37 ’s @entity63 , which will be more powerful - but also much more expensive to fly			0
@entity0 say their @entity3 rocket will be able to carry twice the cargo of the world ’s most powerful rocket currently in operation , the @entity97			2
it will be able to take more than 117,000lbs ( 53,000kg ) to orbit - equivalent to a 737 jet loaded with passengers , crew , luggage and fuel			0
for comparison , the @entity77 can take about 28,700lbs ( 13,000kg ) to orbit - which is roughly the same payload that the @entity3 will be capable of taking to @entity7			2
in the video the two boosters land back at the launch pad ( shown ) after detaching from the main rocket			1
@entity0 ultimately wants to make almost all of their rockets reusable in order to bring the costs of launching down			0
it is estimated each launch of the @entity3 will cost about £ 56 million ( $ 85 million ) the @entity3 is being developed alongside @entity37 's @entity63 ( @entity63 ) rocket , illustration shown , which is expected to complete its first unmanned flight in 2019			1
it will be considerably more powerful than the @entity3 - but is also much more expensive to fly this image from an environmental study by @entity0 shows where they intend to land the various components of their @entity3 rocket at @entity167 in @entity23			1
the contingency pads are for the side boosters , while the main landing pad would be for the central core - as seen in the video later this year , @entity110 is set to reveal the details of @entity0 's secretive @entity174 - the vehicle that could take humans to @entity7			1
it 's likely that their mission to the red planet will require multiple launches of the @entity3			0
while the power of the rocket is impressive in itself , it is the reusability aspect which will prove to be one of its most desirable features			0
earlier this month , @entity0 attempted to land part of one of its smaller @entity77 rockets on a floating drone ship			0
while the attempt dramatically failed , with the rocket exploding as it descended too quickly , @entity0 had always said the first attempt would be risky			0
through failure , they will be able to further refine the process - and ultimately begin bringing rockets safely back to the ground after launching			0
and many will be watching in anticipation when the @entity3 makes its first flight towards the middle of this year later this year , @entity110 ( pictured ) is set to reveal the details of @entity0 's secretive @entity174 - the vehicle that could take humans to @entity7			1
it 's likely that their mission to the red planet will require multiple launches of the @entity3			0

@entity0 have revealed how their @entity3 rocket will work
a video shows it lifting off from a launch pad in @entity23
its side boosters and core then land themselves back at the pad
@entity0 say reusability is key to keeping launch costs down
the @entity3 will be used to take astronauts to the moon and @entity7
its maiden unmanned flight will take place in mid- 2015
and ceo @entity110 is also expected to reveal their @entity7 plans this year
