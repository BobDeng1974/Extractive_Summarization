by @entity0 @entity2 star wide receiver @entity1 has been cut from the team over alleged ties to the notorious @entity6 street gang members implicated in multiple murders , according to a new report			1
@entity1 , 27 , was due more than $ 10million for the upcoming season , but a report citing unnamed sources says the move was hardly a salary cap dump , and more a preemptive strike for a team looking to avoid the next @entity16			1
the shock announcement came friday less than an hour after the report linked the wideout to known gang - bangers @entity20 and @entity21 , as well as explaining how even the name of his record label aligns with @entity6 culture			1
@entity1 was cut friday by the team over alleged gang ties , according to a report the @entity37 native set career highs with 83 receptions for 1,332 yards and nine touchdowns en route to his third @entity42 , but the team reportedly became weary of him flashing gang signs both on the field during games and in social media posts			1
‘ they are concerned about having him around the younger players , ’ a team source told the paper			0
@entity1 and his agent have denied any ties to the murderous gang despite the @entity56 report			1
the six year veteran was the subject of rampant trade rumors for the past several weeks , but the @entity2 decided to instead give him his outright release , according to a team statement			0
‘ after careful consideration this off - season , @entity2 decide to part ways with @entity1			1
the team informed him of his release today			0
’ the team was aware of @entity1 ’s association with the two men , implicated in multiple murders since 2010 , according to the report			1
but the details revealed friday by the paper likely forced its hand – especially with @entity74 teams weary of @entity75 @entity16 suspected in as many as three murders , as well as drug and arms trafficking and gang activity			1

@entity20 is still wearing his @entity85 t - shirt in this shot posted to @entity87 @entity20 and @entity88 were charged in the dec 29 , 2010 execution of a 14 - year - old boy who flashed a rival gang sign at them while riding his bike through crime - ridden @entity94			1
the two men were accused by police of shooting the young boy multiple times , but @entity1 stood by him and even posted pictures of them together while he was detained , the @entity56 noted			1
@entity20 is signed to @entity1 - owned @entity100 under the name ‘ @entity102			2
’ @entity1 was not ever named a suspect in the killing , but was questioned by police			2
an @entity107 spokesperson told the paper the player was ‘ cooperative at the time , ’ and in no way even suspected of having anything to do with the killing			0
charges against @entity20 were eventually dropped after he sat in prison for one year awaiting trial			0
@entity1 , @entity20 and two other men were seen in a photo posted to @entity87 soon after his release			2

' @entity126 ' : jackson ( center ) posted this picture to @entity87 with a caption calling for @entity20 's release while he sat in jail awaiting trial on charges he gunned down a 14 - year - old boy those posts and the police questioning did n’t deter the @entity2 from signing the star player to a five - year , $ 48.5million contract extension			1
about a year after this incident , another troubling gang - affiliated murder occurred in a building owned or leased by a @entity1 relative , police told the @entity56			1
documents including a gun permit and a car title were found in the building where the killing occurred , but @entity1 was not tied to the crime			2
the @entity100 record label , at which @entity20 is a signed artist , is said to be spelled in @entity6 - style – spelling it as @entity152 would be against gang rules since ‘ ck ’ in any use stands for @entity154 , an expert told the paper			1
@entity1 has publicly defended the name of the label by saying the ‘ jackpot.com ’ domain was previously taken			2
' @entity162 60 's ' : @entity1 has been photographed many times flashing the contorted c signal used by members of a local @entity6 gang from the @entity168 neighborhood he grew up in - he even flashed the supposed gang sign at @entity171 player @entity170 on national television last season @entity175 , a hip hop artist long - known to make references to the @entity6 in his music , released a song on @entity100 with @entity1 in a music video flashing hand signals similar to the gang signs flashed by the @entity162 60 ’s neighborhood @entity6 , a gang expert told @entity183			1
@entity1 also flashed the same ‘ contorted c ’ hand signal at the @entity171 ’ @entity170 after making a big catch during a game early last season – on national television			1
‘ you do n't want to see anybody throwing up gang signs like he did in the @entity171 game last year , ’ an @entity107 gang expert told the @entity56			2
‘ those were neighborhood @entity6 gang signs and he flashed them during a game , ’ the expert continued			1
‘ he may not be affiliated with the gang , but they do n't [ ordinarily ] take kindly to those not in the gang throwing up those gang signs			0
’ the boisterous receiver then wrote ‘ 10mode 1 - 0 to start			0
. keep @entity203 , ’ in an @entity87 post after the game			0
‘ @entity1 is not a gang member , ’ @entity207 ceo and founder @entity206 , @entity1 ’s agent , told the paper			1
‘ he ’s far , far from it			0
’ @entity1 was not made available for comment , but did offer the following statement posted to @entity214 by @entity216 reporter @entity215			0
‘ i would like to make it very clear that i am not and never have been part of any gang , ’ said the embattled footballer			0
‘ i am not a gang member and to speculate and assume that i am involved in such activity off the field is reckless and irresponsible			0
’ players have had mostly negative reaction to both the report and the release			0
‘ something is n't right with this @entity1 / @entity2 situation			0
doubt it had anything to do with gang stuff , ’ tweeted @entity30 linebacker @entity228			0
‘ it 's hard to believe some people are trying to draw a connection between [ @entity1 ] and @entity16 , ’ former @entity2 running back @entity233 tweeted			0
@entity1 ’s former coach at @entity168 also defended him , saying there was never any inclination of gang activity and even chalked his rowdy behaviour up to wanting to play up a tough image for the music label			2
@entity1 has never been convicted of any crime outside of a guilty plea in april 2010 to a charge of disturbing the peace .			2
