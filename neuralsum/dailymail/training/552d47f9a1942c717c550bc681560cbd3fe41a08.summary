by @entity0 published : 16:27 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 06:35 est , 21 july 2013 after days of fielding leading questions from @entity5 journalists about drug use in the sport , @entity2 cyclist @entity1 hit back yesterday – literally			1
needing only a solid finish in the penultimate stage of the @entity10 to cruise to victory in @entity13 today , @entity1 was forced to punch one over-eager fan who ran in front of his bike			1
@entity17 - born @entity1 ’s third - place finish yesterday gives him a 5min 3secs advantage in the 100th edition of the sport ’s most famous race , and he simply needs to avoid an accident during today ’s procession from @entity25 to the @entity26 to claim the trophy			1
in action : @entity2 cyclist @entity1 , pictured left during the @entity10 , is on course to win the sport 's most famous race the @entity32 time - trial bronze medallist said : ‘ i ca n’t quite believe i ’m sitting here in this position			1
‘ i ’m a bit lost for words			0
i ’ve still got to roll into @entity13 but this is the general classification sorted out			0
to finish it off like this is special			0
’ @entity1 ’s stunning achievement follows sir @entity41 ’s victory 12 months ago			1
it means that after a wait of 99 years for its first winner of the famous tour , @entity2 will soon have two in as many races			1
unseemly : @entity1 's partner @entity47 became embroiled in a @entity49 row with @entity41 's wife @entity51 last year but @entity1 ’s efforts have been soured by comparisons with @entity54 and the other cyclists who used drugs to dominate the tour in the past 20 years			1
since he powered into the lead with an emphatic victory in the first mountain stage , @entity1 , 28 , has been forced to respond to questions about doping			1
he said : ‘ i can understand why people are asking , given the history of the sport – they have been let down so many times before			0
‘ but i ’m also one of those people who ’s been let down			0
i ’ve also believed in people who have turned out to be cheats and liars			0
but i can assure you , i ’m not			0
’ the media even asked @entity72 to release all the data it has on @entity74 , to combat accusations of doping			0
the team initially refused because it said it might help its rivals , but in an unusual step , it gave @entity5 newspaper @entity80 data collected over the past two years			0
the information was analysed by physiologist dr @entity83 , who did not find any abnormalities			0
he concluded @entity1 ’s performance was n’t as a result of doping but simply ‘ at the upper bounds of what is physiologically possible ’			2
@entity1 has been subjected to 19 drug tests during this tour and 29 in total this @entity93 ’s path to professional cycling , from mountain biking on dusty roads in the nature reserves of @entity17 ’s @entity98 to the giddy heights of the @entity10 and the @entity32 , has been unlike any other in the sport			1
born in @entity102 to @entity2 parents , he was educated in @entity104 and studied economics at university			0
in the lead : @entity1 pictured after finishing third in stage twenty , a @entity110 road stage from @entity111 to @entity112 , of the @entity113 almost there : @entity1 pictured as he realises he is close to winning the @entity10 after finishing third in saturday 's stage but he abandoned his degree to take up the offer of a professional cycling contract in @entity119			1
at first he struggled , not being used to the harsh winters , or the tactics , discipline and etiquette needed in the professional sport			0
but within two years he had signed for the biggest professional team in the world – @entity72 – and last year finished runner - up to team - mate @entity128			2
tension still surrounds the two men after @entity1 sacrificed his own chances to support @entity128 ’ bid for victory last year			2
even their partners became embroiled in an unseemly @entity49 row , with @entity1 ’s girlfriend , @entity104 photographer @entity47 , tweeting : ‘ @entity137 is also about giving the people around you , that support you , a chance to shine in their own right			2
’ congratulations : @entity1 and team mate @entity144 cross the finish line together at the end of stage eighteen on thursday proud : @entity47 tweeted this image of her with cyclist boyfriend @entity1 during the tour @entity128 replied to praise @entity72 members @entity150 and @entity144 for ‘ genuine , selfless effort and true professionalism ’ – but did not mention @entity1			1
today ’s procession into @entity13 will take place later than usual , with organisers delaying the start in the hope of a sunset finish			1
@entity161 rider @entity160 – dubbed the @entity160 – has won the past four sprints on the @entity26 and is aiming to become the first rider to win the final stage five times			2
nearing the end : @entity1 after retaining his yellow jersey after stage seventeen of the @entity10			2

@entity1 was forced to punch one fan who ran in front of his bike yesterday
his third - place finish in penultimate stage gives him a 5min 3secs advantage
he needs to avoid an accident during today ’s procession from @entity25 to the @entity26 to claim the @entity10 trophy
@entity1 will become the second @entity2 cyclist to win the tour in 99 years after @entity41 's victory last year
