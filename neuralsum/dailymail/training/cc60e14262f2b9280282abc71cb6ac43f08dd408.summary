this is the astonishing ' glass ' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible			1
the @entity5 's @entity4 looks as if it is changing colour as it moves , as the background shows through its transparent flesh			1
the bizarre camouflage means you can still see its heart , intestines , and red blood vessels			1
predators do n't have a hop in hell of seeing this crafty frog - whose see through skin makes it almost invisible the @entity20 's @entity4 appears to change colour when it moves because the background shows through its transparent flesh photographer @entity23 snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in @entity27 , @entity28			1
one can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs , where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside			2
mr @entity23 , 46 , said : ' i was looking on the underside of leaves when i found a beautiful female glass frog moistening a clutch of eggs attached to the leaf			2
' this is is extremely rare			2
' the tadpoles inside the eggs were already well developed , and it was almost time for them to hatch			0
' nearby i also found two beautiful males of the same species			0
these frogs normally look small and green when viewed from above			0
photographer @entity23 snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in @entity27 , @entity28 despite it 's amazing camouflage you can still see its heart , intestines , and red blood vessels ' however , the skin covering their undersides and extremities is largely unpigmented and very thin in places			1
' that means it is possible to see the blood vessels running through the body , and even the the internal organs working away inside			1
the frog has transparent eggs , where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside ' background colours show through the frogs minute bodies , helping them stay out of sight among the green leaves			0
' mr @entity23 , from @entity80 , @entity81 , said the frog returned to her eggs regularly to add a protective coat of mucus , which keeps them moist and protects against fungus and parasites			0
he added : ' it is hard to tell which part of this frog is pigmented green and which areas are coloured by the leaves showing through its transparent skin			0
