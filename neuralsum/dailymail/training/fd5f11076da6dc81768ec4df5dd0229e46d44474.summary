a holiday with engineer @entity1 would certainly be a memorable one			1
while his fellow travellers are holding up cameras , professor @entity1 is likely to be holding up a dictaphone			1
and instead of taking in the sights of the @entity8 , the sound engineer is much happier jumping into sewers and camping out in abandoned buildings			0
click on the map to experience unique sounds from the region ... that ’s because the @entity17 professor is on a ‘ soundseeing ’ mission to capture the sonic wonders of the world			1
‘ the sounds of many places we visit are part of the experience , ’ he said			2
‘ and in some cases , what we hear is more important than what we see			0
’ professor @entity1 has set up a website detailing his acoustic adventures to ancient mausoleums , eerie caves and creaking icebergs			1
professor @entity1 claims that there is an area under four archways in @entity39 's grand central station where you can experience a special sound effect			1
on the way to the lower concourse , two people standing at opposite ends of the underpass can hear each other perfectly , even though they are 10 metres away			0
' the stone walls and ceiling do a great job of reflecting the sound on a path across to the opposite side of the underpass , ' said professor @entity1			1
his new book , @entity56 , also catalogues his journeys to these areas			0
‘ they 're places that you want to visit not for the more typical reason , that they 've got beautiful views , but because they 've got beautiful sounds , ’ he told @entity60 magazine			2
@entity69 's whispering gallery in @entity70 was an obvious choice for his adventures			1
thanks to the design of the building , created by sir @entity75 , a whisper can travel around a wall			2
the sound is trapped against the inside of the curved dome wall			0
by tilting the walls inwards at the top , less sound goes upwards and gets lost to the top of the dome			0
but professor @entity1 has also visited some less obvious whispering galleries			1
one such area is the abandoned spy station at @entity89 in @entity90 which is on top of @entity93 ’s @entity92 rising up from the @entity95 forest			0
this man - made hill was constructed from millions of cubic metres of rubble created by bombing raids and artillery bombardments during @entity101 professor @entity1 ( pictured ) measured the world 's longest echo in an oil tank in the @entity106 the echo in the oil tank at @entity108 lasts a world - record 75 seconds ‘ there are a number of different sounds effects you can play with in the dome , ’ said professor @entity1			1
‘ climb on top of the concrete plinth and get into the middle of the sphere and the strong focus creates richocheting sounds when you clap your hands			2
‘ alternatively , you can try whispering just off - centre , and see if you can find the right spot for whispering into one of your own ears			2
’ one of the most interesting sites professor @entity1 visited is an abandoned oil tank in @entity129 , in the @entity106 highlands			1
earlier this year , it earned a place in the record books after producing the world 's longest echo			1
lasting an incredible 75 seconds , the reverberation smashed the previous record - also set in @entity137 more than 40 years ago - by more than a minute			0
it was recorded by @entity139 in a tank measuring twice the length of a football pitch , which was 30ft wide and more than 44ft high			0
the discovery was made by professor @entity1 he climbed into the tank at @entity129 , near @entity145 , and started singing and shouting			1
' i was like a toddler sitting at a piano for the first time , thrashing the ivories to see what sounds would come out , ' he said			2
' reluctantly , after a few minutes i stopped playing with the acoustics and started preparing for my measurements			0
' many of professor @entity1 's sonic wonders are also result of natural marvels such as the @entity157 in the @entity158 , one of about 40 droning dune sites worldwide			1
at certain times , avalanches of sand fall down these dunes to create bizarre humming sounds			0
professor @entity1 claims acoustic tourism can be done virtually anywhere – even in his hometown of @entity169			2
‘ some of my favourite sounds in @entity172 can be found underneath the arches and bridges that were built during the industrial revolution , ’ he writes in his blog			0
‘ there are plenty of tourist sites where what you hear is essential to the experience , sometimes to the point of being more important than what you see			0
’ thanks to the design of @entity69 , created by sir @entity75 , a whisper can travel around a wall			1
the sound is trapped against the inside of the curved dome wall			0
by tilting the walls inwards at the top , less sound goes upwards and gets lost to the top of the dome			0

@entity1 from the @entity17 has created an *interactive* map *documenting* some of the world 's most interesting sounds
it details his trips to mausoleums , eerie caves and creaking icebergs
@entity207 also *includes* the whispering gallery in @entity70 's @entity69
sounds also come from natural *structures* such as the @entity157 in the @entity158 of *southeastern* @entity212
