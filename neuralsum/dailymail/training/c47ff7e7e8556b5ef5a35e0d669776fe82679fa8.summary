smart phones are so much more than making calls or taking the odd picture			1
but if you are one of those who use your mobile to send emails , watch tv and read the news - paper online every day , you ’ll find that the battery can run down perilously quickly			1
@entity16 and @entity17 have put some to the test what might help is a charger that ’s as mobile as your phone			1
so here , @entity16 and mobile phone expert @entity17 , editor of @entity25 rate the new portable chargers — from wind - up to solar - powered ... what a wind up wind - up phone charger , £ 24.99 wind - up phone charger , £ 24.99 , windup - @entity32 @entity33 : this is a sleek hand - held box , with a fold - out handle for winding			1
for each minute wound , it gives up to two minutes of battery			1
if your phone powers down in the wild , just it in to this and frantically twirl the handle			1
test : it ’s hard to charge the entire phone this way , but this is unbelievably useful to have in your car ’s glove - box			1
@entity52 says : i ’d very much recommend this if you ’re out and about , but if you have a power - hungry phone it wo n’t keep it going for long			1
only useful in the short - term			1
7/10 @entity59 @entity60 - e , £ 19.99 @entity60 - e , £ 19.99 , mymemory.co.uk @entity33 : this is either solar - powered or you can shine a lamp on it to automatically charge it			1
this functional - looking black charger is around the size of a smart phone and has enough battery for about two - and - a - half times the charge of an @entity70			1
test : it ’s idiot proof — it is obvious how to use it and i can see how much power it has left via a row of four lights			1
not only did it charge my phone , but it also boosted the charge over the next four days			2
@entity52 says : a solar - powered phone is environmentally friendly , but most of these do n’t come with the right phone lead , so you ’ll need one			2
10/10 @entity88 audio powerbank , £ 20 audio powerbank , £ 20 , tesco.com @entity33 : this is both a torch and a charger			1
slightly bigger than a lipstick , this will charge an @entity70 one - and - a - half times before you need to recharge it — but it does suit many electrical devices including @entity98 and @entity99			2
charge it up by plugging it into a laptop or usb port with the lead provided			2
check you have your own lead to charge from charger to phone			1
test : during last winter ’s storms where i live in the @entity111 , i found myself in the pitch black with no phone battery			2
i intend to keep this fully charged by my bedside table for emergencies , and it ’s great for your car , too			2
@entity52 says : one of the @entity70 features which uses up the most battery is the flashlight			2
this torch will save masses of juice			2
9/10 @entity125 - sized wonder @entity127 , £ 39.99 @entity127 , £ 39.99 , firebox.com @entity33 : a sexy , slender credit card - sized charger with enough charge for to get an iphone to half power			1
it ’s compatible with the @entity70			2
test : by far the coolest looking charger , it is put through its paces in rural @entity138 where one of my sons is playing hockey			1
i forget to charge my phone and by the time i reach the match it is almost dead			0
when i plug this in using the tiny attached lead , a slim white light flashes on the front			0
i delightedly watch my phone takes on just enough juice to get me through the afternoon			0
@entity52 says : excellent , but only as a back - up			0
8/10 lots of talk time @entity155 , £ 69.99 @entity155 , £ 69.99 , @entity156 @entity33 : gives up to 25 hours extra talk time on a mobile phone			0
looks like a large cigarette lighter , but this gives a good two phones charge			0
test : plug this into your phone using a lead			0
it charges all usb powered devices — phones , mp3 players and tablets — adding four - and - a - half hours to an @entity174			0
i use it on a day in @entity177 without a charged phone			0
it is dark and freezing cold , but i plug this in and within a couple of minutes i am connected			0
@entity52 says : remember the days when you could carry around a spare battery and swap it into your phone ? this is the closest thing			0
it is pricey , however 9/10 every girl ’s @entity187 @entity189 , @entity190 , £ 49.99 @entity189 , @entity190 , £ 49.99 , cleverkit.com @entity33 : touch up your make - up with a back - lit mirror while charging your phone			0
a slim @entity70 - shaped mirror with enough charge to fill a phone up to two times			0
test : i ’m irritated by a female - targeted device			0
but i try this while waiting for my sons to finish school			0
it not only helps me do my make - up , it charges my phone in double - quick time			0
@entity52 says : the mirror element makes it bulkier than needed , but i suppose women will like it			0

smartphones have so much to offer now , it *'s* not surprising the batteries *drain* so quickly
what you really need is a charger you can use anywhere
