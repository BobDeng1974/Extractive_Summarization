the @entity1 team could find themselves in hot water again , this time in @entity3 , after they were spotted driving through the city of @entity5 without registration plates			1
pictures showed a bright yellow @entity9 pick - up truck , apparently driven by presenter @entity10 , as it made its way down @entity5 's @entity13 thoroughfare			2
it carried no registration plates and tonight , when asked by @entity15 , a sergeant in the @entity17 said : ' we would have to pull the driver over			1
the plates were thought by some to be a veiled reference to the @entity44 of 1982			1
but the @entity45 claims the vehicle was perfectly legal as it had what is known as a ' temporary operating permit ' ( @entity49 )			2
today vancouver police sergeant @entity50 told @entity15 that all cars driving in the province of @entity53 had to have registration plates on their front and rear			1
the only exception is for cars given a top which , the policeman said , is a piece of paper usually in the back window			1
but after viewing these pictures of @entity10 's @entity9 driving through his city , sergeant @entity50 said : ' if we had pulled this vehicle over we would have cited it for not having a plate			1
' he added : ' we would have to pull the driver over , make sure he 's not got the registration permit on his lap or in his glove box			2
it 's got to be visible to the rear			2
' big car for a big country : @entity10 takes a look at the @entity9 pick - up he seems set to be driving getting the shots : members of the @entity1 production team film the presenter as he checks out the car @entity84 set up : the production team film a segment with proper shoulder - mounted cameras and lighting another big car : this black @entity90 pick - up will apparently also appear in the forthcoming programme if the @entity1 team had failed to register their cars for the road in @entity3 they could face a further $ 109 fine sergeant @entity50 said the temporary operating permit is a fairly large sheet of paper and should be clearly visible , even in the tinted windows of the pick - up used by the @entity1 team			1
if they are stopped by @entity3 police , the @entity1 team could face fines			1
for failing to display the registration ' you would potentially be cited for $ 109 under the motor vehicle act , ' said sergeant @entity50			2
' if they do n't have vehicle insurance [ which they could not have if the vehicle was not properly registered ] they could be cited for not having valid motor insurance which is $ 598			2
' if the @entity1 team had failed to register their cars for the road in @entity3 they could face a further $ 109 fine , sergeant @entity50 said			1
such registration is a prerequisite for getting a car insured			0
however , a @entity45 spokesperson said : ' as a brand new vehicle , the car was being driven with a temporary operating permit which , as permitted by law , was displayed in the car 's window			0
' at all times the vehicle was insured , registered and road legal as per both @entity128 and @entity3 law			0
' famous : @entity10 and @entity131 may pose for a selfie with a female fan on their way through the airport pressing the flesh : @entity10 shakes hands with another fan while the first checks out her trophy photo the apparent gaffe is merely the latest controversy for @entity1 , which has faced a string of accusations of poor taste and even racism in the past year , and indeed in previous years			0
comedian @entity148 , himself known for controversial opinions , went so far as to call @entity10 a ' cultural tumour ' as he called for the presenter 's dismissal from the @entity45			0
the latest number plate controversy comes after @entity37 's ambassador to the @entity155 demanded an apology from the @entity45 after @entity10 drove through her country with a registration plate which apparently referred to the @entity44			1
but @entity45 head of television refused to make an apology to ambassador @entity162 and insisted the programme would be broadcast			0
in a letter to ms @entity162 , mr @entity164 said : ' we will ensure that these programmes are a fair representation of what took place throughout their stay			0

' i would like to reassure you again that nothing we have seen or read since the team returned supports the view that this was a deliberate act			1
' mr @entity164 also said ' the @entity45 was disturbed by the violence the team faced during their visit '			1
the @entity1 cast and crew had to flee the @entity39 country after they were attacked by an angry mob , which @entity10 described as ' the most terrifying thing i 've ever been involved in			0
' ms @entity162 was not the first diplomat to be upset by the long - running motoring show			0
in 2011 , the @entity45 had to apologise to the @entity210 ambassador over comments made by @entity10 and co-hosts @entity213 and @entity214			0
may described @entity210 food as ' like sick with cheese on it ' and @entity10 predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because ' at the @entity210 embassy , the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this ( snores )			0
they wo n’t complain , it ’s fine			0
' in fact the @entity210 ambassador , his excellency @entity228 , did complain about the ' outrageous , vulgar and inexcusable insults ' and the @entity45 was forced to say sorry .			0
