by @entity0 last updated at 12:13 am on 23rd january 2012 @entity1 is planning a shake - up that will see ranges and price discounts tailored to the incomes of families who live near its stores			1
the move is designed to breathe life into @entity12 sales after a disastrous fall in @entity15 takings			1
in poorer areas , where there is a threat from successful budget chains such as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity1 will stock and promote more value lines , it is claimed			1
@entity27 practise : @entity1 is planning to adapt its product range and discounts relative to the wealth of an area for richer or poorer : customers in more affluent areas will be pushed to buy top - of - the - range items such the company 's finest products ( left ) , while those in less well - off locations will have better deals on its value lines ( right ) and in affluent areas stores will push the retailer ’s top - of - the - range finest lines in an attempt to stop customers deserting to the likes of @entity47 ’s , @entity48 and @entity49			1
@entity1 already has a policy of charging more in its smaller @entity52 and @entity53 stores than mainstream supermarkets			2
the company , @entity12 ’s biggest retailer , also charges different prices for petrol based on location and the level of local competition			2
@entity1 does , to some extent , tailor its ranges to the affluence and shopping habits of customers , based on information gathered through its clubcard loyalty scheme			2
second chance : the strategy is being pushed through by @entity1 's @entity12 chief executive @entity71 ( above ) , who was behind the unsuccessful ' @entity73 ' campaign details of the new strategy , which is said to go much further , were revealed by @entity1 suppliers who have been talking to industry magazine @entity78			0
the magazine said : ‘ @entity1 is set to launch a wave of price promotions and range reviews based on the affluence of areas			1
’ it said the strategy is being spearheaded by the chief executive of its @entity12 business , @entity71			0
mr @entity71 was also the man behind @entity1 ’s ‘ @entity73 ’ campaign , which has failed to deliver the boost in sales and profits the company was looking for			1
the move , which promised annual savings worth £ 500million , was part of an attempt by @entity1 to be re-cast as a champion of low prices			1
however customers , who have continued to see the cost of their weekly shopping increase , were not won over			0
rivalry : @entity1 is now having to beat off fierce competition from the likes of budget chain @entity21 which has experienced strong growth in recent years underlying sales in the crucial @entity15 trading period showed an annual fall of 2.3 per cent , bringing warnings that profits at the supermarket chain will not grow as expected and wiping almost £ 5billion off the share price			1
by contrast , budget chains such as @entity21 continue to grow more quickly than any other , with new store openings and a surge in sales of around 20 per cent a year			1
@entity117 's take on @entity1 's tailored marketing the @entity119 said : ‘ @entity1 has begun talks with suppliers aimed at launching price promotions in less well - off areas where it is facing competition from the likes of @entity21 and @entity22			1
’ one supplier said : ‘ it has a list of about 100 stores where it is going to launch special deals at discount prices			0
we will work with them , although we will be very concerned if they try to pass on the cost			0
’ at the same time another 200 stores in affluent areas have been highlighted for promotions on more upmarket ranges and products			2
one retail industry analyst said : ‘ it ’s a very clever idea and a much more strategic approach being taken by @entity1 , unlike the “ @entity73 ” , which came across as very knee - jerk			2
‘ @entity71 has been saying that affluence is the new format			0
’ @entity1 refused to comment on any upcoming strategy			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we are not considering dual pricing			0
we can not make any comment beyond that			0
we already have different ranges in different stores			0

move comes after *nosedive* in sales over @entity15
will promote value lines in poorer areas **...**
**...** and top - of - the - range items in rich ones
