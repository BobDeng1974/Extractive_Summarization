@entity0 continued his seemingly inexorable rise with a hard - fought but ultimately comfortably victory over @entity3			1
facing by far the toughest opponent of his 15 - fight career , @entity0 controlled the fight from start to finish with only his trademark stoppage missing from an otherwise accomplished performance			1
in doing so , he took another step towards challenging for a world title , just two years after turning professional after missing out on the @entity13 in 2012			0
@entity0 recorded a comfortable victory in @entity15 against @entity3 @entity0 cruised to a unanimous points victory against his @entity18 opponent @entity3 arrived in @entity15 having lost just twice in 30 contests , on points to @entity21 and to world champion @entity22			1
and , as he promised , the @entity23 gave @entity0 a stern examination in front of his home crowd at the @entity27			2
the opening round was cagey with both men relying on their jabs but @entity0 gradually began to feel his way into the contest			2
and by the fourth round , he looked to have @entity3 's number as he drove a left hook into the challenger 's body , wobbling him briefly			1
@entity0 extended his unbeaten start in the professional game to 15 victories sensing blood , @entity0 marched forward and had his opponent under severe duress but ran out of time in the session to finish the job			1
and @entity3 recovered sufficiently between rounds and continued to frustrate @entity0 , taking him beyond the sixth stanza for the only the second time in his career			1
and @entity0 , one of four boxing brothers , was in uncharted territory by the 11th round but had more than enough in the tank to round off a disciplined performance			0
the only drama in the final session was an outburst of song from the travelling @entity59 contingent in support of @entity61 ahead of his rematch with @entity63			0
the @entity15 fighter ( right ) was awarded a points victory by a wide margin on all three scorecards the judges were in agreement as to the winner with varying scores of 118 - 111 , 120 - 108 and 118 - 110			0
@entity0 , whose gran passed away last week , said : ' it 's been a hard week for the family but going to the gym has helped			2
' i hurt him with a body shot and that proves i can hurt anyone in the world			0
he was tough but i was hesitant to go for him because i had n't been past 12 rounds			0

@entity0 beats @entity3 by unanimous *decision* in @entity15
win was the 15th of @entity0 's young career and he is still unbeaten
