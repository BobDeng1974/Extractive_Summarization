you might not be able to use this hoverboard to outpace bullies like @entity4 's @entity3 , but this aquatic version of the sci - fi skateboard will let you perform tricks in thin air			0
invented by @entity11 jet ski champion @entity9 , the @entity12 by @entity13 is a cross between flying and surfing and looks a little bit like a wakeboard attached to a large hose			1
the company that makes it describes the @entity12 as ‘ a new innovative extreme discipline that will make you experience new sensations ’			0
the 59 ft ( 18 metre ) hose is attached to a speed boat , or similar inventor : @entity11 jet ski champion @entity9 sensation : a cross between surfing and flying propulsion : jet of water provided from a 59 ft ( 18 metre ) hose maximum height : 16ft ( 5 metre )			1
top speed : 16mph ( 25km/h ) extras needed : lesson and a motor boat cost : $ 2,675 ( £ 1,577 ) speed : the 59 ft ( 18 metre ) hose is attached to a ‘ personal water craft ’ , such as a speed boat , which has between 180 and 300 horsepower			1
restrictions : there are no height restrictions for riders , although the @entity11 company notes that people weighing more than 17 stone ( 110kg ) may not get the full effect of the device			1
the water - propelled device allows people to fly up to 16ft ( 5 metres ) above the surface of the water at speeds of up to 16mph ( 25 km / h ) , as well as perform tricks including somersaults and spins			1
the board ’s agility has been demonstrated by popular @entity73 @entity72 and his friends in @entity75			2
it is attached to a hose and propelled by a powerful jet of water			2
the 59 ft ( 18 metre ) hose is attached to a ‘ personal water craft ’ , such as a speed boat , which has between 180 and 300 horsepower			2
the hoverboard has one rider and can be used solo , but relies on a motor boat driver following the @entity12 ’s lead , unless a special attachment is used			0
there are no height restrictions for riders , although the @entity11 company notes that people weighing more than 17 stone ( 110kg ) may not get the full effect of the device			1
a hoverboard like the fictional one used by @entity3 in @entity94 ( pictured ) does not need water propulsion			2
the aquatic equivalent , from @entity11 jet ski champion @entity9 , is set to launch this summer and can be pre-ordered for $ 2,675 ( £ 1,577 ) the company that makes it describes the @entity12 as ' a new innovative extreme discipline that will make you experience new sensations '			1
a flyboard is pictured on the right - hand side of this photograph it can be used in a lake or at sea , but the water must be over 13 ft ( 4 metres ) deep			1
riders need at least one hour of professional training to get to grips with the controls of the @entity12 , and ensure they are safe on it			0
the device is related to the company ’s @entity115 , which lets riders ‘ fly ’ through the air by strapping a small board with two water nozzles attached to their feet			1
the @entity12 is set to go on sale this summer - a year before @entity3 was said to have used his in @entity94			0
it can be pre-ordered for $ 2,675 ( £ 1,577 ) @entity123 reported			1
riders need at least one hour of professional training to get to grips with the controls of the @entity12 , and ensure they are safe on it - and considerably more practice to pull stunts like this to provide propulsion for the board , a 59 ft ( 18 metre ) hose is attached to a ' personal water craft ' , such as a speed boat , which has between 180 and 300 horsepower researchers have taken a step closer in the quest to develop a hoverboard that does not rely on water , by levitating objects in @entity141 using sound waves			2
while scientists have previously managed to suspend objects in mid-air using what 's called acoustic levitation , a team of @entity145 engineers have managed to move objects around space in various directions			0
bubbles , a screw and a tiny piece of wood have so far been manoeuvred like a hoverboard , but the objects must be inside a complex set - up of four arrays of speakers to be able to fly			0
the machine , which was created by engineers at the @entity164 and the @entity165 , uses ultrasonic speakers to generate sound waves that cross over			0
according to the researchers , this intersection creates ' a moveable ultrasonic focal point , ' or a cross-over of high frequency noise greater than @entity173 , which is at the upper limit of human hearing			0
standing waves - waves that remain in a constant position - provide a suspending force so the focal point can be moved up , down and from side - to - side , in order to support a small floating object such as a screw that is trapped in the standing waves			0
while scientists have previously managed to suspend objects in mid-air using acoustic levitation , a team of @entity145 engineers have proved they can move objects around at will through three dimensional space using a refinement of the technology			0

the board was invented by @entity11 jet ski champion @entity9
users report it feels like a cross between flying and surfing
device has a top speed of 16mph and can ' fly ' 16ft above water
it can be used on a lake or at sea but water must be at least 13ft deep
@entity213 can be pre-ordered for $ 2,675 ( £ 1,577 )
