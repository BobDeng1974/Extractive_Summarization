@entity1 scientists have unveiled detailed plans for a proposed mission to the moon , which could take place within the next decade			1
the aim of the mission is to analyse the @entity8 and assess its potential for a possible human base to be developed in the future			1
a probe will also drill 330ft ( 100 metres ) below the surface to look at whether it will be possible to someday have observatories on the moon			1
called @entity22 the crowd - funded spacecraft will fly to the @entity8 where there is constant sunlight ( illustration shown ) up until now , there have been no missions to the moon 's @entity8 , which is of particular interest because its home to the largest impact crater on the @entity35 , the @entity37 ( @entity38 ) basin			1
the @entity38 has a diameter of 1,550 miles ( 2,500km ) and covers almost a quarter of the moon			0
scientists believe remnants from the @entity38 impact may still be present in this area , and analysis of the material may be used to date the basin			0
the @entity22 vehicle will be delivered into space by a medium - lift rocket , such as @entity51 's @entity50 , before embarking on its journey to the moon			1
once on the moon , the spacecraft will drill 100 metres ( 330 feet ) down to collect samples for scientific analysis ( illustrated )			1
it will collect samples every six inches ( 15cm ) , which will be scooped up and placed in the spacecraft for scientific analysis to answer questions about the moon once there , it will carry out a descent sequence to the lunar surface , with four engines ensuring it lands gently within a pre-determined landing site the size of a football stadium			1
on the surface it will drill to depths of up to 330 feet ( 100 metres ) , collecting samples every six inches ( 15cm ) for analysis on board the spacecraft			1
it 's thought that the top 33ft ( 10 metres ) of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles			1
further down , though , the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago			0
the deepest samples that have been obtained are from three metres below the surface , by @entity93 astronauts @entity94 and @entity95 in 1972			0
the company plans to send a robot lander to the @entity8 of the moon - an unexplored area			1
they will drill to a depth of at least 66ft ( 20 metres ) - 10 times deeper than has been drilled before - and potentially up to 330ft ( 100 metres )			1
the hole will be two inches ( 5cm ) in diameter , and it will take the lander one hour to drill each six inches ( 15cm )			0
core samples will taken from each six inches			0
it will then study lunar rock from this depth that is 4.5 billion years old , and has remain untouched underground			0
it 's thought the top 33 feet ( 10 metres ) or so of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles			2
further down , though , the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago			0
among the scientific questions hoping to be answered , @entity22 wants to discover the true origins of the moon			2
the spacecraft will be delivered into space by a medium - lift rocket such as @entity51 's @entity50			2
it will carry out a staged descent sequent to the lunar surface			0
four main engines will ensure it lands gently on the surface and keep it within a landing site the size of a football stadium			0
the spacecraft will be equipped not only with a drill , but also a jointed robotic arm to extract segments from its core , and other instruments to analyse core samples and monitor seismic @entity144 solar cells will power the lander			2
the samples of varying depths will be analysed on board the spacecraft inside special capsules ( illustrated )			2
it 's thought that the top 33 feet ( 10 metres ) or so of rock will be a fine - grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles , while further down will be rock fused by heat inside the hole ( illustrated ) will be placed archived data from the public on @entity162			1
people can buy a space on the memory discs for £ 64 ( $ 100 )			0
the team are seeking funding now and hope to launch in 2024 among the scientific questions hoping to be answered , @entity22 wants to discover the true origins of the moon			2
backers for the mission , dubbed @entity22 , hope to raise money from the public by inviting people to buy space on memory discs for less than £ 64 ( $ 100 ) each			1
these discs will act like time capsules for photos , videos and other files , and will be buried in a bore hole drilled into the lunar surface			0
@entity1 engineer and city financier @entity185 , who came up with the plan said : ' people can put any information they like in the memory disc ; it will be like a personal time capsule , a private archive			0
it could be a small message saying " hi , i 'm @entity197 " or a whole family history			0
' professor @entity199 , who is one of @entity22 's scientific advisers , said that despite more than 50 expeditions to the moon , far more needs to be done to understand our satellite			1
' until recently the @entity206 had plans for a lunar lander ( which has since been scrapped ) and the science case for @entity22 is quite similar , ' he told @entity210			2
' in addition , we propose to have a drill so there will be new science too '			0

@entity1 - led mission to the moon is *due* to be *completed* in the next decade
called @entity22 , a spacecraft will fly to the lunar @entity8
there , it will drill 330ft ( 100 metres ) down to collect samples for analysis
inside the hole , probe will bury archived data from the public on @entity162
up until now , there have been no missions to the moon 's @entity8
the material collected could help explain how the @entity162 's moon formed
