by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 03:55 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 19 april 2013 sir @entity3 yesterday left the his mother 's home in @entity6 , telling reporters the @entity8 would have been moved by her funeral @entity8 could not have had a ‘ finer commemoration ’ of her life than this week ’s extraordinary ceremonial funeral , her son sir @entity10 has said			1
he expressed heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in wednesday ’s service , which he called a ‘ splendidly dignified and deeply moving farewell ’ for @entity19 ’s greatest peacetime prime minister			0
writing on behalf of himself and sister @entity21 , sir @entity10 gave his first detailed remarks since the funeral in a letter to cabinet office minister @entity25 , seen by the @entity26			1
‘ i wanted to write to thank you and , through you , all those many people who were involved in the planning , organisation and conduct of my mother ’s funeral , ’ he wrote			1
‘ this was an immense and complex task and yet it was accomplished with the utmost skill , sensitivity and attention to every possible detail			0
‘ the result was a splendidly dignified and deeply moving farewell that will , i am sure , live long in the memory of all those present			0
‘ @entity21 and i could not have hoped for a finer commemoration of my @entity33 ’s life ; and we will always be hugely grateful to you and to all the departments , organisations and indeed individuals represented on the @entity50 committee who made it possible			0
’ mr @entity25 chaired the @entity54 committee , codenamed @entity50 , which put into place detailed plans for the funeral at @entity58			1
they were drawn up under the last @entity61 government and approved by the administrations of @entity63 and @entity64			2
officials from the @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and the government whips ’ office were all involved in coordinating the event			0
‘ it was a massive occasion for the @entity67 to organise on a tight timetable , ’ said a source			0
picture left to right : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity3 , @entity85 and @entity86 @entity8 's grandchildren @entity86 and @entity85 led the coffin into @entity58 mr @entity25 has said that the bill for the funeral , criticised by some @entity91 , will be ‘ much , much less ’ than a reported figure of £ 10 million , but no official estimate has yet been released			1
@entity54 sources said there have been no detailed discussions about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers – mr @entity63 , sir @entity99 and @entity64			1
at only 70 , @entity99 is now the oldest living former prime minister – the lowest age for the holder of that position at any time since @entity104			2
but one source added : ‘ @entity25 has made it clear he would not object to a similar scale of funeral for @entity63 , who like @entity8 did win three general elections			1
‘ whether you like him or not , that is quite a big deal			0
given the relative youth of our former prime ministers there has not been any detailed planning for this			0
@entity8 left very detailed instructions and most former prime ministers will have a clear idea of what they want			1
’ thanks : a copy of the letter sir @entity10 sent to @entity25 the @entity3 family is now expected to grieve in private and wait several months before her ashes are interred alongside those of her beloved husband , sir @entity126 , at the @entity127 in @entity128			1
a range of proposals to commemorate her life and leadership of @entity19 is being considered , from a @entity3 library to a statue in @entity136 and the renaming of the capital of the @entity139 , @entity140 , to @entity141			0
sir @entity10 had already said yesterday that his mother would have been ‘ profoundly moved and gratified ’ by her spectacular ceremonial funeral			1
speaking outside @entity8 's home in @entity6 , sir @entity10 said : ‘ my mother would have been profoundly moved and gratified by the send - off she was given			1
’ it is thought the ashes will be interred in the autumn			2
a family friend told the @entity151 : ‘ they are very conscious that there will be a lot of interest surrounding the interment of the ashes			2
‘ they thought it would be better to do it at some point in the future			0
the family have heard some of the ideas but they need to think about it			0
’ @entity8 ’s granddaughter @entity86 , 19 , who gave a moving reading during the service , has returned to @entity169 to prepare for exams next week at the @entity171 , @entity172			2
she has flown back to the @entity169 with brother @entity85 and mother @entity173 , sir @entity10 's first wife			1
@entity174 is expected to publish details of the costs of the funeral as early as next week			0
the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ we will publish the costs in due course			0
i think people will understand it can take a little time to draw together the final costings for high - profile and significant events such as yesterday ’s funeral			2
‘ that is what is being done , and we will publish the costs			0
’ @entity86 , who delivered a reading during the funeral service in @entity58 , has flown home to @entity169 asked whether the figure would include the full cost of the thousands of police and military personnel who were present at yesterday ’s event , the spokesman said : ‘ it will take account of the fact that a significant proportion of the personnel involved in the funeral ceremony would already have been on working duty			1
’ deputy prime minister @entity208 defended the use of taxpayers ’ money for @entity8 ’s funeral , dismissing the objections of some @entity91 by pointing out plans had been agreed under the governments of mr @entity63 and mr @entity64			1
‘ there ’s nothing new about the government of the day supporting funeral costs for significant public figures and , of course , former prime ministers - that is actually quite an established convention and has happened before , ’ he told @entity216			0
‘ these plans were not suddenly invented out of thin air , these were worked on over a long period of time , were pretty well established in detail by the previous government , not this coalition government , and of course with the full consent , co-operation and support of the family			2
‘ of course , i can hear that there are people who have differing views but whether you are for or against @entity8 , everybody recognises she was a very significant political figure and this was a big occasion and that it was done on a cross-party basis			2

more than *2,300* *guests* attended the spectacular ceremony at @entity58
sir @entity10 spoke for the first time after the funeral to reveal his mother would have approved
family delay interring the @entity8 's ashes until the autumn
