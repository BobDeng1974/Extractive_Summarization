last october 's explosion of @entity6 's @entity5 rocket may have been triggered when debris inadvertently left in a fuel tank traveled into the booster 's main engine , two people familiar with investigations into the accident told @entity11			1
the sources said the preliminary findings suggest that a simple assembly mistake by @entity6 could have caused the explosion , which destroyed a cargo ship bound for the @entity17			1
@entity6 initially linked the explosion to a problem with the turbo pump in one of the two @entity24 - era @entity23 engines that power the rocket			1
@entity28 's @entity27 unit refurbishes the old motors and resells them as @entity23 motors			2
cameras recovered from the launch pad in @entity33 shed new light on disaster ( still image shown )			2
the remotely operated cameras captured the explosion up - close in incredible detail			2
the @entity5 rocket was due to launch an unmanned @entity43 @entity42 spacecraft to deliver more than 5,000lbs of supplies to the @entity17 on 28 october			1
this included science experiments , experiment hardware , spare parts , and crew provisions - as part of a £ 1.2 billion ( $ 1.9billion ) deal with @entity53			0
outfitted with a new , more powerful upper - stage engine , the @entity5 rocket was packed with 5,055 pounds ( 2,293 kg ) of supplies , science experiments and equipment , a 15 percent increase over previous missions			1
but just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed , leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure			2
@entity6 on friday acknowledged that so - called ' foreign object debris ' was one of more than a half dozen credible causes of the explosion , but said it was not ' a leading candidate as the most probable cause of the failure			1
' @entity6 spokesman @entity72 said the company - led ' accident investigation board , ' which includes officials from @entity53 and the @entity76 , had not identified any evidence of mishandling of the flight hardware by @entity6			2
he said @entity6 continued to compare data from the october explosion with a may 2014 test stand failure of a different @entity23 engine , and prior failures involving @entity23 ground tests in 2009 , 2011 and 2012			1
no details have been released on the may 2014 test stand incident , but sources familiar with the earlier investigation said it was likely linked to faulty ' workmanship ' on the original motor , and additional inspections had been mandated to prevent mishaps with other engines			2
@entity6 also successfully launched one @entity5 rocket in july 2014 , after the may incident			1
@entity53 spokeswoman @entity97 said @entity53 was conducting its own internal ' lessons learned ' review of the accident , but declined to give any details about individual aspects of the investigation			0
she agreed with @entity6 that foreign object debris was always considered as a possible cause in aerospace accidents			2
if the investigations confirm that debris from the fuel tanks caused the @entity5 explosion , that could have significant financial and legal effects for @entity6 , which was formed by the merger of @entity114 and @entity115			1
the new findings could also open the door for a legal claim against @entity6 by @entity28 , which took a $ 17.5 million loss in october , after @entity6 said the accident had prompted it to accelerate plans to switch to a different engine			1
one source said the @entity6 investigation could end without declaring a single ' root cause ' for the explosion			2
probes of past accidents have had similar results			0
officials have confirmed the @entity132 launchpad in @entity33 ( shown after the explosion ) could be repaired as soon as 2015			1
the @entity5 rocket exploded seconds after lift - off on 28 october , but in a statement it was revealed the pad escaped severe damage several sources said it may be difficult to determine conclusively whether the debris entered the engine before the explosion , or as a result of it			1
@entity147 , spokesman for @entity27 , declined to comment on the investigations , noting that they were still underway			0
he also declined to comment on the cause of the may test stand failure , which is part of the investigation			0
one of the sources familiar with the probe said investigators found particles of a crystallized desiccant , or drying agent , in the turbo pump and other parts of the @entity23 engine			1
the crystals could have caused sparks and triggered a fire when they hit the turbo pump in the oxygen - rich environment , the source said			1
desiccants are often used to control moisture in fuel tanks but need to be removed before takeoff , the sources said			0
@entity114 have said a new version of @entity5 could launch as soon as 2016			0
this will be using new engines , which will be tested in a ' hot fire ' next year			0
just seconds into the launch a turbopump in one of the engines failed , leading the rocket to experience the catastrophic failure ( shown ) the explosion partially contaminated the region around the launchpad			1
but last week the @entity187 revealed it would take just a year to repair the damage			0
repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £ 8.3 million and £ 12.8 million ( $ 13 million and $ 20 million ) while the @entity53 investigation had not finalized the root cause of the accident , there were multiple signs that suggested some ' foreign object debris ' had been ingested into the engine from the fuel tanks , one source said			2
antares had four previous successful flights			0
the oct. 28 explosion was the first accident since @entity53 began using commercial providers to fly cargo to the space station			0
@entity6 already faces steep bills for damage to the launch site , and the need to buy a different rocket to launch its next cargo ship to the space station			2
in december , the company said it would buy a booster from @entity217 , a joint venture of @entity219 and @entity220 , to meet its obligations under a $ 1.9 billion cargo supply contract with @entity53			0
@entity6 is one of two companies @entity53 hired to fly 40,000 pounds of cargo each to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011			0
privately held @entity229 , or @entity229 , has the other contract , valued at $ 1.6 billion			0
repairs to the launch pad and its facilities are expected to cost between £ 8.3 million and £ 12.8 million ( $ 13 million and $ 20 million )			0
and in a separate release , @entity6 confirmed they would launch a new @entity5 rocket by the end of 2016			1
' under the new approach and in line with @entity6 's existing @entity240 contract , all remaining cargo will be delivered to the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) by the end of 2016 , ' said the company			2
' there will be no cost increase to @entity53 and only minor adjustments will be needed to the cargo manifest in the near term			0
' @entity6 also confirmed they will seek a new propulsion system upgrade for @entity5 , as it was believed the @entity251 engines used on the october launch were the reason for the failure			1
the company will perform a ' hot fire ' test of the new engines next year to ensure they work as planned			0
the @entity53 - funded rocket exploded on its way to the @entity17 ( shown ) just six seconds after lift - off from the @entity132 on @entity262 in @entity33			1
the rocket exploded at 6:22pm edt on 28 october , and was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine organisations said more than £ 125 million ( $ 200 million ) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion ( previous image shown )			1
@entity114 said it would stop using the type of @entity251 engines that were employed when its unmanned @entity5 commercial supply rocket exploded they explained how in the first aerial surveys of the launch pad they could see their cameras , but they had to wait several weeks to get everything back from the @entity282			1
one of the cameras was even located very close to the middle of the pad and right in the middle of the explosion			0
as dust and debris flies around , the camera somehow manages to survive			0
the rocket was carrying equipment that would have helped hunt for asteroids to mine and also a number of @entity298 - observation satellites			0
organisations said more than £ 125 million ( $ 200 million ) worth of equipment was destroyed in the huge explosion .			0
