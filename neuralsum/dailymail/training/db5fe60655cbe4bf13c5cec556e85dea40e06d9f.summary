' i thought it was some wood or some grass or something , and when we looked at it , we saw that it was an elk			0
i have never seen it before , a frozen animal in the ice			1
' she said she believed the elk must have fallen through earlier in the winter before the ice hardened properly			2
although many can swim and bear cold weather better than humans , they can still die of exhaustion if they tread water too long ' we had to go out a bit from land , so the ice was strong enough when he started to walk , but then further out it was not strong enough			2
it 's part of nature that animals die in this way			0
' since her grim , but unusual discovery the body has been become a local attraction and visitors have made the trip to view the frozen carcass			0

last month two horses in @entity76 were rescued by firefighters from a frozen lake after they 'd fallen through the ice			2
the dramatic rescue happened in the town of @entity82 - about 40 miles east of @entity83 - when the two horses fell through the ice on a private lake as their owner , @entity87 , watched helplessly			0
rescuers used chainsaws to cut a path through the ice where the horses could make it out , and after about an hour , they made it to dry land - and a thankful owner .			0
