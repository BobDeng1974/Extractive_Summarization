by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 for @entity3 next , it ’s @entity4 or bust			1
only the lure of a grandstand farewell performance in the star - spangled fight capital of the world is likely to dissuade the conqueror of @entity11 from bowing out after ‘ the greatest night of my boxing life '			2
at coming up 37 and having finished his aggravated business with @entity16 in the most conclusive manner possible - with one of the most spectacular knock - out punches in the annals of the prize - ring – he needs an irresistible reason to go back to the well of world championship punishment yet again			2
looking ahead : @entity3 , snapped by our man @entity25 in the aftermath of his stunning victory over @entity29 at @entity11 , would like to end his glittering career in @entity4 game over : @entity3 's monster right hand knocked out @entity29 in front of 80,000 people at @entity11 brutal : @entity29 was poleaxed in the eighth round to leave his world title hopes in tatters on saturday night party time : @entity3 celebrates his victory over @entity29 in their rematch as he retained his two world titles @entity43 – colourful namesake son of the @entity45 legend – on that @entity4 of temptation to the rich tune of pay - per - view in @entity49 as well as @entity50 could provide the incentive			1
or maybe a rematch with @entity53 , the only super-middleweight in the world @entity3 has not defeated			1
‘ how is @entity63 going to pull off anything to top what i ’ve just done ? ’ , @entity3 asked of his @entity57 promoter after he had illuminated an historic saturday night at @entity11 by exacting retribution against @entity29 in a manner which not only sent his young challenger into a coma but stunned a record 80,000 crowd			1
@entity3 provided the answer himself : ‘ it has always been a dream of mine to fight in @entity4			1
that box remains to be ticked			0
i will enjoy the summer with my family before i even think about what to do after this incredible night			0
‘ this could be the perfect way to hang up the gloves			0
but a signature fight in the @entity74 ... ’ the more he thought about it the more appealing that notion became : ‘ after all , i feel 36 years young			2
’ next up ? @entity3 fancies a crack at @entity43 ( left ) in the fight capital of the world , @entity4 another bristling young @entity80 , former olympic gold medallist @entity81 , reinforced his claim as no 1 contender for @entity3 ’s @entity85 belt with an impressive victory of his own , over @entity49 @entity87			1
but the silencing of another noisy neighbour like @entity29 is low on @entity3 ’s priorities and @entity91 expects he will have to wait for his moment			1
not least because after two successive mandatory fights against @entity29 , @entity3 is now entitled to at least one voluntary defence of his @entity85 and @entity96 titles			1
so while it might be convenient again for @entity63 to bring together two of his stable of fighters , he concedes : ‘ i have to find something to put before @entity3 which floats his boat			2
otherwise who knows if he will box again ? ’ still , even as he took his late - night leave of the fabulous scene of his concussive glory , the @entity107 seed was beginning to take root in his warrior mind			0
@entity3 recalled how a low - key first trip to @entity4 filled him with the ambition to return there as a show - topping champion			1
making a scene : @entity29 had planned his entrance to the final detail as he wowed the @entity11 crowd pretty in pink : @entity3 's walk - on was less complicated but the champion still made his presence felt taking a trip : @entity29 entered the cavernous @entity11 on a red double decker bus he travelled to watch prince @entity126 take on @entity127 there 13 years ago , taking his partner @entity129 with him			1
‘ back then we did n’t have much money , ’ he said			0
‘ we could n’t afford the @entity132 so we stayed down at @entity133			0
‘ we ’d saved up to go so arrived skint			0
i knew nothing about gambling but could n’t resist trying			0
i threw our last few dollars cash on the craps table and lost			0
‘ so i thought i could get it back by putting the biggest bet i could extract from the atm machine on @entity126 to win			0
just our luck , he lost his world title			1
‘ but now i had the dream of going back there with my name up in lights			0
’ @entity63 will try to make that happen , preferably against @entity149			0
not because @entity3 lost to @entity53 but because , as he puts it : ‘ @entity53 is a great fighter but has such an awkward style that he ca n’t draw enough fans to fill his own front room			2
’ @entity149 was quick to respond			0
‘ i welcome a fight with @entity3 , ’ he said			1
‘ the fight would be huge ; @entity45 and @entity80 have always had a great rivalry in sports			2
also , the fight would give me the opportunity to become the first fighter from @entity45 to win the super-middleweight world title			1
’ @entity63 calculates , also : ‘ after this performance against @entity29 , @entity3 is where the big money is in the super-middleweight division			1
so there is an orderly queue forming to fight him , if he decides to go again			0
’ third time ? @entity3 could complete his trilogy with @entity170 with both men having won one fight each unification : @entity175 super-middleweight champion @entity174 ( right ) wants to fight @entity3 other options include a rubber match against his old @entity179 warrior foe @entity170 , with whom he stands at one win apiece and who has just decided to make a comeback			1
@entity175 champion , tough - nut @entity174 , turned up at @entity11 carrying his belt and offering a title unifying match			0
@entity174 will also be a target for @entity29 once he has ‘ gone back to the drawing board '			2
shrewdly , @entity189 had taken out insurance against a second loss to @entity3 by signing in advance a big - money contract with his new @entity195 promoters , @entity196			2
but exactly where he goes from here depends on how he reacts to being heavily knocked out in the eighth round of a fight which he had trumpeted @entity3 had ‘ no chance of winning ’			2
@entity3 said : ‘ a defeat like this can either finish a boxer ’s career or give him the motivation to come back all the stronger			1
it depends on his character			0
there are one or two other belt - holders out there against whom he might win a world title			1
‘ but to be honest he lacks the essential element of real hardness to trouble the elite			0
i doubt he can ever beat @entity53			0
and deep down he knows now i would beat him ten times out of ten			0
’ options : @entity81 is now the mandatory challenger for @entity3 's @entity85 super-middleweight title big win : the referee steps in to stop the fight between @entity81 and @entity226 at @entity11			1

@entity3 could retire after beating @entity29
@entity229 could also finish his career with a fight in @entity4
@entity43 is the most likely option
the @entity45 has said he is prepared to fight @entity3
@entity81 is the new mandatory challenger for @entity3 's @entity85 world title
