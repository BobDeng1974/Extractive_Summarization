@entity1 dr @entity0 promised herself that if a vaccine against the meningitis b infection were discovered , she would have her children immunised			1
' i 've seen too many children die from this horrific disease or lose multiple limbs or suffer brain damage , ' says dr @entity0 , 47 , a consultant at the private @entity11 in @entity12			2
' i consider myself a tough nut after nearly 25 years working as a doctor in children 's infectious diseases , but i get so upset when i think about all the families who have been devastated by meningitis @entity18 @entity21 's daughter @entity20 , now nine , developed meningitis caused by meningococcal b at 16 months ( both pictured ) ' the scary thing is just how quickly it takes hold			1
in less than four hours of experiencing their first symptoms - which may just be a temperature , vomiting or a flu - like illness - they can be in multiple organ failure			2
in 24 hours , they can be dead			0
' around 10 per cent of those who catch meningitis b die within 24 to 48 hours , even if they receive antibiotics			2
one in five is left with long - term problems , including limb amputation , hearing loss , learning disabilities and brain damage			2
meningococcal b is a bacterium that causes the most common form of bacterial meningitis , meningitis b - an infection of the meninges , the protective membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord			1
this meningitis kills by causing intense pressure on the brain			2
if bacteria enter the bloodstream , they can also cause septicaemia , which can lead to shock and multiple organ failure			0
a new vaccine against the bacterium is available in the @entity63 , but can only be obtained privately			1
this is because after spending a year deliberating , the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) - an independent body of experts which advises the government - provisionally recommended last july that the jab should not be routinely given to all of the estimated 700,000 babies born in the @entity63 each year			1
instead , it said it should only be given to those with certain immuno - deficiencies , such as disorders of the spleen , or those on immune - suppressant drugs			2
so why would other babies not be offered protection ? the experts deemed it was not cost effective			2
but @entity83 , chief executive of the @entity84 , says : ' the @entity63 's child mortality rates are among the highest in @entity86 and @entity87 contributes to this terrible fact			1
' the charity reckons the costs of caring for meningitis survivors with serious disability can be at least £ 3 million per child , once caring , loss of earnings and rehabilitation are considered			1
meningitis b infections can affect all age groups , but children , and especially babies , are at risk due to their immature immune systems			1
no other infectious disease kills as many under - fives as bacterial meningitis and septicaemia and most cases are caused by meningococcal bacteria			1
between 2006 and 2011 , 247 adults and children died from meningitis caused by meningococcal b in @entity113 and @entity114 , and about 3,400 are affected by bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the @entity63			1
around 10 per cent of people carry the bacterium harmlessly in their throat , but can pass it on to others			0
sometimes outbreaks occur at universities because students live in close proximity			0
@entity21 took @entity20 to @entity124 with a temperature he could n't bring down , but was told she had a urine infection symptoms are varied and may be similar to flu in the early stages , so it can be difficult to diagnose			1
the vaccination costs around £ 75 a time privately - and children may need several			1
babies aged two to five months need four injections , one to two months apart ; those aged six months to two years need three ; the over-twos need two			1
the vaccine committee is now reconsidering the evidence and will announce its ruling next month			0
already , 118 paediatricians , nurses and scientists have written to health secretary @entity143 , pressing for the committee to reverse its decision			0
' it is a cause for concern to us that after years of research , a vaccine which could prevent a significant proportion of cases of this dreadful disease might simply be shelved , ' they wrote			0
dr @entity0 , who signed the letter , says the opportunity to introduce the vaccine is ' a historic moment '			0
' the @entity63 has had one of the highest rates of @entity87 in the world - scientists still do n't know why this is , but we could be the first country in the world to eradicate it if we introduce routine vaccinations , ' she says			1
' the vaccine against @entity167 ( a different strain of meningococcal bacteria ) , introduced in 1999 , has been incredibly successful			0
but the majority of bacterial meningitis infections in the @entity63 are caused by @entity87			1
' one man who needs no convincing about the jab is @entity21 , whose daughter @entity20 , now nine , developed meningitis caused by meningococcal b at 16 months			1
she lost both her hands and the lower part of both her legs			0
' she developed a temperature and nothing we did would bring it down , ' says @entity21 , 50 , a former betting shop manager who lives with wife @entity185 , 40 , and their five other children in @entity188 , @entity189			1
' i took her to @entity124 at midnight , a few hours after she first developed the temperature , but was told she had a urine infection and we were sent home			0
in the morning , though , she was sick and as i lifted her top , i saw two tiny cherry red spots each the size of a pen top			0
i drove her back to @entity124 , barged into triage and showed the doctor the spots - by then there were 12			0
' within minutes , all hell broke loose - she had tubes everywhere and about ten doctors and nurses were swarming round her			0
' four hours later , @entity20 was rushed by ambulance to @entity207 in @entity208 and her heart stopped twice on the way			1
@entity20 was in a coma for three weeks			1
' doctors explained her body had diverted blood to save her organs , causing a loss of supply to the extremities , and her hands and feet would have to be amputated , ' says @entity21			2
' we wondered what quality of life she could have			0
within weeks , though , she had started to move around on her bottom			0
' after standard prosthetic limbs proved uncomfortable , the family paid privately to have carbon blades made - she was the youngest recipient ever to have them			2
' she is a fantastic kid and things have worked out better than we could have ever hoped - but obviously , given the choice , we would far rather she had n't had this terrible disease			0
' the jabs will cost hundreds of pounds privately and that is going to be too expensive for a lot of families - they should be available on the @entity236 to every child			2
' @entity21 says while @entity20 is fantastic , given the choice , he would far rather she had n't had this terrible disease there is no doubt the vaccine committee has a difficult decision to make , says dr @entity245 , consultant in general paediatrics and vaccinology at the @entity248 , part of the @entity250 , who helped conduct some trials for the vaccine			1
he says : ' the manufacturers claim the vaccine will be effective in preventing 75 to 88 per cent of @entity87 in the @entity63 , but this is only based on lab tests			1
we wo n't know how effective it will be until we start using it on large numbers of people , ' he says			0
' the committee face a difficult decision because we do n't have all the evidence - but we wo n't get it unless we introduce it			0
' the cost of introducing mass vaccination for babies , and a catch - up campaign for toddlers and 15 - to 18 - year - olds , are potentially huge			1
dr @entity0 paid privately for the jabs for her two youngest children , and her eldest , aged 13 , will have hers soon			2
' i had a recent case of a ten - month - old baby found dead in his cot by his sibling , ' she says			0
' he 'd been examined thoroughly by his gp the night before and seemed ok			0
how many more parents need to wake up one morning and find their child dead before something is done ? ' @entity285			0

@entity68 provisionally recommended it should not be given to all babies born in @entity63 each year
