stick with @entity0 today as the full 23 - man line - up for @entity2 is unveiled at 1pm @entity3 has been told by @entity4 that he will not be in @entity6 ’s @entity2 squad , pointing to @entity7 being among the 23 players he names at 1pm			1
when asked if he had been left out on tuesday night , @entity3 said : ‘ yes , it ’s true			2
’ the snub is likely to signal the end of @entity3 's international career			1
out : @entity3 , who played in @entity15 's testimonial on tuesday night , will not be selected for @entity2 over doubts about his fitness , while @entity7 is now expected to feature for his country goalkeepers : @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , @entity22 ( @entity23 ) , @entity24 ( @entity25 ) defenders : @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity7 ( @entity30 ) , @entity35 ( @entity21 ) , @entity36 ( @entity30 ) , @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , @entity28 ( @entity27 ) midfielders : @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , @entity42 ( @entity39 ) , @entity43 ( @entity32 ) , @entity44 ( @entity21 ) , @entity45 ( @entity30 ) , @entity46 ( @entity41 ) , @entity47 ( @entity34 ) , @entity48 ( @entity21 ) strikers : @entity53 ( @entity34 ) , @entity50 ( @entity34 ) , @entity51 ( @entity32 ) , @entity52 ( @entity30 ) the @entity54 have refused to confirm the outcome of talks between @entity7 and @entity4 at @entity30 ’s @entity58 training ground on tuesday but @entity4 has certainly resolved the issue of having @entity3 and @entity7 in the same dressing room when @entity7 is awaiting trial for the alleged racial abuse of @entity3 ’s brother , @entity63			1
the @entity54 stripped @entity7 of the captaincy , which led to @entity65 quitting as @entity6 manager in february			0
the omission of @entity3 and @entity68 ( understood to have been put on standby ) as well as injury to @entity70 would suggest @entity7 has made the cut			1
but @entity4 could still take only seven defenders , with @entity33 covering as one of four centre halves and as a second right back alongside @entity31			0
disappointment : @entity3 , who lined - up for @entity34 in tuesday night 's testimonial for @entity15 in @entity76 , will not be going to @entity2 is @entity4 right to axe @entity3 for @entity2 ? the players @entity4 plans to leave out received phone calls on tuesday night breaking the news			1
@entity81 and @entity82 are out , while @entity83 will miss out through injury			0
@entity81 ’s omission would suggest @entity51 will go to @entity86 and @entity87			2
but the focus will remain on @entity3 and @entity7 at @entity4 ’s @entity90 press conference , even if the manager will point to @entity3 ’s injury record as the reason he has been omitted			1
@entity3 has not played for @entity6 since last june			0
on tuesday night , he was in action for @entity34 in their 4 - 1 in over an @entity98 xi. the game at @entity76 's @entity96 was a testimonial for @entity15 , @entity34 's hero of the 1958 @entity101 air crash			0
ruthless streak : @entity4 , who left @entity104 officially on sunday with the best wishes of the club 's fans , has already made some bold calls with @entity6 @entity4 also presented his new employers with a logistical headache when he cancelled next week ’s training trip to @entity112 in @entity113			2
he had already decided to give the @entity30 players involved in saturday ’s @entity116 final the week off , as well as @entity53 , and has now decided it is not worth going			0
it could be he takes them to @entity120 for a shorter training break before a friendly against @entity123 in @entity124 a week on saturday			0
out : @entity81 in : @entity51 out : @entity82			2
