@entity1 captain @entity0 remains unflustered by @entity3 's early lead at the top of the @entity5			1
@entity7 's pacesetters are three points clear at the summit after six games and a further two ahead of a @entity1 side who are widely seen as their likeliest title challengers			1
the only points that @entity3 have dropped thus far came in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity1 last month , suggesting the @entity16 are not likely to let their advantage slide easily , but @entity0 knows there is plenty of mileage yet in the 2014/15 campaign			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 is n't bothered by @entity3 's fast start to the season he led the side that looked dead and buried in the title race three seasons ago , only to take the title on the final day , and also saw @entity28 drop off from a strong position last term			1
' i ca n't really say that personally i 'm looking too much at @entity3 , ' said the @entity32			2
' when we won the league first time ( in 2012 ) , we were nine points behind with six or seven games left to play			0
@entity38 's flying start has led @entity3 to four wins out of five in the @entity5 so far ' last year @entity28 were leading by six or seven points and ahead of everyone in february but it ended up being between @entity42 and us			1
' there are so many reasons why i 'm not really focusing on getting back at @entity3			2
' @entity1 recorded their first league win in four at @entity47 last weekend and , far from obsessing over their rivals ' start , @entity0 is training his focus squarely on another away day at @entity51 on saturday			1
@entity52 rescued a point for @entity1 in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity3 at the @entity55 ' away games in the @entity5 are ever so difficult , so it was good for us to get a result ( at @entity47 ) , ' he said			2
' there are no easy games ahead			0
the next game is at @entity51			0
' every fixture is a potential slip - up , but that 's what 's exciting about this league			0
i just look at the way we are playing and i just know we are going in the right direction			0
that 's the most important thing for us			0
