' months later , when life without @entity20 was n't getting any easier , i realised that i had questions only @entity9 could answer			1
when the family liaison officers were with me one day , i suddenly asked out of the blue if i could go and meet him in prison			0

' i went to see @entity9 because i needed answers			1
i had to know exactly how @entity20 had been killed , before i could even try to move on			0
when i first saw him i felt numb			1
i can remember looking at him and thinking , you b * * * * * *			0
' in that situation you 're only allowed to ask three questions , but i only wanted to ask the one			0
he could tell that was the real reason i was there , so he talked me through the crash			0
he admitted he and another driver had been speeding , racing each other			2
' the other car had pulled back into his lane , he said , which had made him swerve and mount the grass verge			2
i could see how sorry he was and he apologised repeatedly			0
' i told him i accepted his apology but i did n't forgive him and hoped to never see him again			2
that night , i slept properly for the first time in two years			0

' she was going to her dad 's that evening			0
he lived about 20 miles away so her best friend @entity114 and another friend @entity9 , who i 'd not met before , were going to give her a lift			1
' they arrived at about 5.30			0
@entity9 had a silver @entity102 and i waved them off , giving @entity118 a big hug before she went			1
she 'd always been so independent and mature , we felt like friends rather than mum and daughter			2
