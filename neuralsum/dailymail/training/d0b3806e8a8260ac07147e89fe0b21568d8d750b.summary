but one couple have a slightly different memento of their relationship - a contract agreeing that she will be his mistress in exchange for him paying for her home and income			1
and now the unusual - but at least organised - contract , along with recordings she made of their conversations spanning their 30 - year affair , is being brought to the @entity24			1
the real - life anonymous couple - she is 88 and he is now 93 - live in separate houses in the same city on @entity31 's west coast			1
in exchange for ' mistress services ' , including ' all sexual acts as requested , with suspension of historical , emotional , psychological disclaimers , ' he has provided her with a comfortable life			1
the unconventional pair first met at university but drifted apart , before meeting again 20 years later			2
they then embarked on the affair after she drew up ' @entity44 ' , agreeing that for the duration of the agreement , she would become his sexual property			1
part of the contract , which was neatly typed out , involves him keeping his mistress in ' tasteful accommodations to her liking together with expenses accrued in the normal course of her activities '			2
in return she would , along with sexual acts , provide him with companionship when he was in the area '			1
upon receipt of the document - which she faxed to him - he phoned her immediately to accept			2
@entity66 's @entity65 will host the play , which is based on an unusual 30 - year contract their business and pleasure relationship has now formed the plot of a play written by @entity1 , the @entity74 screenwriter behind the @entity76 biopic @entity77			1
the woman describes herself as a highly educated , intelligent woman with a history of involvement in the feminist movement , the @entity65 , where the play will be performed , said			0
she and her wealthy lover taped their conversations about their relationship while they ate , laid in bed and travelled			0
the pair anonymously penned a book called @entity44 , only signing themselves as she and he			0
their identities have understandably remained shrouded in mystery , as many question the nature of the relationship			0
in the opening lines of the book , one transcribed conversation records him heaping praise on her ' audacity ' and ' sheer genius ' of having him sign the contract , which he says ' makes him fall in love with ( her ) all over again ' whenever he remembers it			2
their recorded conversations cover each others views on the other 's personality , criticisms , spats , loving words and sex			0
@entity44 is @entity1 's debut at @entity66 's @entity65			0
her television credits include @entity125 's @entity124 and @entity125 1 's @entity123 , while her theatre credits include @entity127 , performed at the @entity128 in @entity66			0
