three families of children orphaned by @entity2 were able to celebrate @entity3 yesterday after @entity6 and @entity7 charity @entity4 stepped in to make sure they did not miss out			1
the children had been left to fend for themselves despite a multi-million pound international appeal to raise funds to help and despite promises from the @entity14 government that they would be helped			1
their plight is that of tens of thousands of other children - an estimated 42,000 in @entity14 and @entity18 - who have lost parents to the deadly virus , which has killed 7,518 people in @entity23 this year this year			1
the @entity24 returned to the slums of @entity26 yesterday to check up on the children whose plight we highlighted in a series of reports last month			2
we wanted to make sure that they would not only be able to enjoy @entity3 this year , but for many more years to come			0
instead , we found that they had been abandoned			0
in september , @entity33 , 15 , watched his mother die in the bed next to him at an ebola treatment centre in @entity26			0
@entity33 survived , but with his father already dead , the boy and his four brothers and sisters found themselves orphaned and on their own			2
@entity33 ( back right ) watched his mother die next to him in a bed at an ebola treatment centre in @entity26			0
here the family are pictured with food and toys provided by @entity6 and @entity4			1
clockwise from top left is @entity49 , 17 , @entity50 , five months , @entity33 , 15 , @entity51 , 8 , and @entity52 , 5 @entity33 recovered after contracting @entity2 while it killed his mother in the bed beside him @entity49 holds her infant brother @entity50 beside her brothers ( from left ) @entity52 , @entity51 and @entity33			1
they claim no - one from the government or aid agencies had contacted them until @entity6 spoke to them @entity33 and his late mother @entity62 are pictured together left			1
on the right , they are pictured with @entity52 and @entity51 sitting outside the tin shack of a relative who is trying to look after them , @entity33 said : ' we are missing our parents , i do n't have any new clothes to wear today			2
' look at my friends - they have clothes to wear			0
i remember during the @entity3 season mother use to take us to the market and buy clothes and toys for us , but today they are dead			0
' he began to cry			0
his 17 - year - old sister , @entity49 , said they had been abandoned since the deaths of their parents			2
no - one from the government or the international aid organisations had done anything to give them a future , she said			0
' i am frustrated because we have being abandoned by family members as well as the government			0
today is @entity3 : how will we be happy with no @entity93 or @entity94			0
no - one is helping us			0
it is very hard to get food everyday because our aunt whom is taking care of us does not have any money or any support , ' she said			2
since the death of their parents , other people in the area were afraid of them and had shunned them , said @entity49			2
they had to resort to begging for food from friends and family			0
' at times i feel so sad that we have turned into a beggar because our parents have died			2
we do n't even have something to remember them			0
only @entity114 is our hope now , ' @entity49 said , and then she too burst into tears			0
@entity118 , @entity14 's development chief , said she would take a personal interest in the @entity122 family 's case but the children say there has been no such intervention the @entity127 children should never have been in this position			1
last month @entity14 's minister for gender and development , @entity118 , promised to take a personal interest in their case - and that of three other groups of orphans - after the @entity24 visited her in her office in @entity26 to highlight their plight			1
according to the children , there has been no such intervention			2
@entity14 's politicians have been busy with senate elections this month			1
however , when challenged today , the minister instructed a member of her staff to contact the children immediately to offer them assistance			2
to try to help , the @entity24 contacted the @entity7 charity street child , which has been working hard to provide a safety net for the orphans			1
together we were able to deliver food and toys to three of the four families - one had gone out of the city - so that they could have a @entity3 meal and a few presents			2
the presents included teddy bears , toy cats and dogs and toy cars			0
the food included @entity14 staples - rice , vegetable oil , beans and salt			1
but the most important present was the once provided by @entity4 , in the form of a promise of ongoing assistance to get them back on their feet			2
that includes a business grant for the friends and relatives who have taken them in to help them earn enough money to support the children			1
@entity4 programme director @entity183 said the woman looking after the @entity127 children was sitting in their compound with her head in her hands when the team arrived			2
' she had n't made any money at the market for three days and was thinking through how she might be able to provide food for the family tomorrow , or even today			0
she was hungry , sad and struggling			0
the arrival of @entity4 meant we could give them food relief now and some toys for @entity3			0
we will help her set up her own small business in the new year so she no longer has to rely on odd jobs and unreliable income			0
i 'm told the joy in her face was overwhelming : she felt like a miracle had occurred and all her prayers answered this @entity3			0
' the team also visited two other families featured in the @entity24 's reports last month - the @entity211 and @entity212 children - in @entity26 's @entity214 slum and delivered the same package of presents , food and the promise of ongoing help			1
the @entity222 family 's mother died from @entity2 in the @entity214 slum in @entity26			1
pictured from left is @entity225 , 14 , @entity226 , 7 , @entity227 , 9 , and @entity228 , 17 the @entity222 family ( pictured ) were left to fend for themselves and could no longer go to school after losing both their mother and father to @entity2 hope of medical school but no money to pay for it : the @entity211 siblings ' mother sold food at the market but she wanted better for her children many other children were not so lucky			1
no parents meant no presents and little to eat yesterday			0
in @entity14 , the worst hit country , 3,376 people have died			1
many were parents with large families and their children faced their first @entity3 on their own			1
hundreds of millions of pounds of international aid has been pledged to the country but with much of the money directed to building and running treatment units , the fate of the survivors has taken a back seat			0
the @entity14 authorities and some international aid agencies have been slow to tackle the problem , blaming the initial decision to concentrate on treatment centres for the failure to provide a safety net			1
@entity4 is one of the few agencies actively targeting orphans , working with 10,000 children in @entity14 and @entity18			1
@entity267 estimates that there are 30,000 orphans in @entity18 , while @entity14 government officials last month put the figure there at 12,000 or more			1
' there are thousands of children left orphaned by the @entity2 outbreak and the international community is being too slow to respond , ' said @entity267			1
' very little support is actually finding its way to the children who are left in their communities traumatised , grief stricken and in many cases starving to death			1
@entity212 , 15 , @entity283 , 6 , and @entity284 , 12 , were being looked after by a neighbour after both their parents died			0
here they are pictured with supplies provided by @entity6 and @entity4 no hope of school : @entity283 in the @entity214 slum in @entity26 , @entity14 , with her mother @entity293 's voting card @entity2 orphans : @entity284 , @entity283 , and @entity212 in their home in @entity214 slum in @entity26 , @entity14 ' in many cases their belongings will have been burned and their parents bodies removed , they are left with nothing but the stigma attached to them and nobody to turn to for help			1
' ' these children do n't exist in a ' system ' anywhere , they are abandoned in their communities			0
' she said government was managing to reach a few hundred children but the rest were on their own			0
' the reality is nothing is reaching the thousands of kids that are outside of this and need help urgently , ' she said			0
' @entity4 wants to do more – reach more children			0
we want to ensure all vulnerable orphaned children that we know about have enough rice to eat over the @entity3 period and beyond this help them re-start a more prosperous life			2
yes , @entity23 most definitely does know it 's @entity3 time – when i was in @entity26 last week the city was blaring out the @entity3 songs and artificial trees and tacky decorations were being sold on the side of most streets			0
these kids are facing the loneliest and hardest @entity3 they will ever know , @entity2 has affected the poorest communities meaning they are struggling more than ever to survive			1
the families that have taken in orphaned children will be struggling to care for their , now extended , family			1
' beyond the @entity3 period we will ensure that each family that has taken in the orphaned children is trained and set up with a grant in a small business so that they can earn enough money			1
' there are four ways to give to the @entity346 : @entity2 to 70660 to donate £ 5 set up a monthly donation by texting streetchild £ 3 , streetchild £ 5 or streetchild £ 10 to 70707 donate online at street - child.co.uk / donate or send a cheque or postal order to : @entity4 , 42 - 44 @entity350 , @entity352 @entity351			1

three families orphaned by @entity2 receive donations thanks to @entity6
@entity7 charity street child has stepped in to provide business grants
the families will also receive ongoing support to help them survive
it is estimated 42,000 children in @entity14 and @entity18 have lost parents
