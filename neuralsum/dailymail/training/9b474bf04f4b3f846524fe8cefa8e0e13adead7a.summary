by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 28 may 2013 a young woman is breaking traditional perceptions of ' tomboys ' by combining her career in sports with entering the world of beauty pageants			0
while @entity12 loves nothing more than having her blonde locks tended to by hairdressers and enjoying a weekly manicure , her path to the finals of miss @entity10 is very different from most			1
unlike other beauty queens , she ’s not afraid to break a nail or get her perfect spray tan covered in mud when she she plays professional ladies football twice a week			2
@entity12 , 17 , juggles her football career ( right ) with her life as a winning beauty queen ( left ) @entity12 says her love of football started at a young age when she used to play in the garden wit her father @entity12 has been so successful in the pageant world that she has now reached the finals of the @entity10 competition @entity34 , 17 , from @entity35 , plays centre midfield for @entity38 ladies ’ squad - and regularly faces trips to @entity41 following spills on the pitch			1
her rather masculine career has n’t stopped @entity12 from reaching the finals of national beauty pageant @entity10 however , and the teen is hoping to carry away the crown			1
although she ’s training as a hairdresser , working part time in a beauty salon , @entity12 would love nothing more than to win a scholarship to an american football academy - and play football for @entity10			1
@entity12 said : ' all my friends see me as a typical girlie girl - i love my hair extensions , fake tans , and trips to the salon as much as any of my friends			2
' but they do n’t understand why i ’m so keen to go and get covered in mud down on the football pitch at the weekend			0
@entity12 is equally as happy giving her all on the pitch as she is getting a manicure and competing as a beauty queen @entity12 says she hopes to inspire other young girls to pursue football through her work in the pageant ' sometimes men expect me to be a bit of a bimbo , and ca n’t believe i want to watch the football with them , but i usually end up explaining the offside rule to them			1
' i have loved football ever since i used to have kickabouts with my dad when i was about five or six			0
he got me really into the game , and now i love it as much as he does			0
' but we ’re the only two in our family who are really interested in footie - all my cousins and uncles are n’t really that bothered about it			0
' i ’ve been so excited about competing in @entity10 , and i was thrilled to get through the semi finals			2
' i was a bit worried , as i had a nasty fall on the pitch a couple of weeks before , and i was worried my arm was going to be in a sling while i was competing - luckily it was ok though			1
' i really want to help raise the profile of women ’s football and encourage other girls to go out and give it a try			0
