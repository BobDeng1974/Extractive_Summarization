by @entity1 reporter published : 18:29 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 18:43 est , 4 november 2012 @entity4 paid an income tax rate of only 1.9 per cent on its earnings outside the @entity7 in its latest fiscal year , a regulatory filing by the company shows			1
the world 's most valuable company paid $ 713 million in tax on foreign earnings of $ 36.8 billion in the fiscal year ended sept. 29 , according to the financial statement filed on oct. 31			1
the foreign earnings were up 53 per cent from fiscal 2011 , when @entity4 earned $ 24 billion outside the @entity7 and paid income tax of 2.5 per cent on it			1
@entity18 earned : @entity4 , a store in @entity19 pictured , paid a rate of only 1.9 per cent income tax on its earnings outside the @entity7 in its latest fiscal year the tech giant 's foreign tax rate compares with the general @entity7 corporate tax rate of 35 per cent			1
@entity4 may pay some income taxes on its profit to the country in which it sells its products , but it minimizes them by using various accounting moves to shift profits to countries with low tax rates			2
for example the strategy known as ' @entity35 with a @entity35 , ' routes profits through @entity38 and @entity39 subsidiaries and then to the @entity40			0
other multinational corporations also use such tax techniques , which are legal			0
like other big companies , @entity4 leaves cash overseas			2
if it brought it home to the @entity7 , it would have to pay @entity7 corporate taxes on the money			1
great escape : the world 's most valuable company paid $ 713 million in tax on foreign earnings of $ 36.8 billion in the fiscal year ended sept. 29 the cash that @entity4 has left overseas as of sept. 29 has mounted to a stunning $ 82.6 billion , up from $ 74 billion as of june 30			1
where @entity4 does differ from other companies is that it sets aside a portion of the foreign profits , marking them as subject to @entity7 taxes sometime in the future			0
when @entity4 reports quarterly results , it records that portion of the taxes as a liability , which is subtracted from its profits even though it has n't actually paid the taxes			0
tax experts say the company could easily eliminate these ' phantom ' tax obligations			0
that would boost @entity4 's profits for the past three years by as much $ 10.5 billion , according to calculations by @entity75 reported in july			2
while investors might rejoice if @entity4 suddenly added $ 10.5 billion to its profits , unilaterally erasing a massive @entity7 tax obligation could tarnish its reputation as a relatively responsible payer of @entity7 taxes			1
instead , the company is lobbying to change @entity7 law so that it can erase its liabilities in a less conspicuous fashion			0
overall @entity85 , @entity86 - based @entity4 had net income of $ 41.7 billion , or $ 44.15 per share , in fiscal 2012			0
that was up 61 per cent from $ 25.9 billion , or $ 27.68 per share , in fiscal 2011 .			0

of @entity4 's $ 36.8 billion in foreign earnings they paid $ 713 million in taxes in their latest fiscal year
the company 's tax rate is over *66* - times less than general corporate tax rates in the @entity7
leaving their cash overseas @entity4 's strategy *exempts* them from paying @entity7 corporate taxes
