despite years of research suggesting otherwise , a new study claims humans did not evolve to cooperate with one another as strongly as first thought			1
previous theories claim that in nature , humans cooperate because it in everyone 's interest to do so			1
but , given half the chance , people have a tendency to be selfish - especially if they can increase the amount they benefit from betraying or deceiving someone			1
two @entity17 researchers studied human cooperation			1
their study focused on a game theory called the @entity21 , in which people are more likely to benefit if they were selfish ( stock image shown ) instead of cooperating the latest study , published in the @entity24 , was carried out by scientists from the @entity17			1
in a series of experiments twisting the classical game theory match - up known as the @entity21 , selfish strategies became more successful			1
in the classic game , if both players cooperate , they both receive an equal payoff			2
this game theory looks at how people might cooperate or betray one another for their own interests			1
in the classic example , two members of a criminal gang are arrested			0
each are held separately to one another			0
there is not enough evidence to convict them of their main charge , but they are both given a year in prison on a lesser charge			0
however , the police give each separately the option of betraying the other and turning them in , or staying silent and cooperating			0
if both stay silent and do n't testify agfainst the other , they will each serve their single year in prison			0
however , if one betrays the other , but the other chose to cooperate , then the one who betrayed will be set free and the other is given three years in prison			2
if they both betray each other , they both serve two years in prison			2
the theory goes that two rational people would choose to betray , as they are guaranteed not to get the worst sentence			1
however , previous studies have shown that humans show a bias towards cooperating			1
but if one cooperates and the other does not , the cooperating player receives the smallest possible payoff , and the defecting player the largest			0
if both players do not cooperate , they both receive a payoff , but it is less than what they would gain if both had cooperated			0
in general it pays to cooperate , but it can pay even more to be selfish			2
last year , postdoctoral researcher @entity83 and @entity84 from the @entity17 published a mathematical explanation for why cooperation and generosity have evolved in nature			2
but their new research played out in a large , evolving population , found that adding more flexibility to the game can allow selfish strategies to be more successful			1
in the new investigation , the researchers added a twist			0
not only could players alter their strategy - whether or not they cooperate - but they could also vary the payoffs they received for cooperating			0
initially , as in their earlier study , cooperative strategies found success			2
but with higher and higher payoffs at stake , the temptation to defect also rose			0
and they found that the population of players reached a tipping point , after which defection was the predominant strategy in the population			0
the work paints a dimmer but more realistic view of how cooperation and selfishness balance one another in nature			0
' it 's a somewhat depressing evolutionary outcome , but it makes intuitive sense , ' said @entity123			0
' we had a nice picture of how evolution can promote cooperation even among self - interested agents and indeed it sometimes can , but , when we allow mutations that change the nature of the game , there is a runaway evolutionary process , and suddenly defection becomes the more robust outcome			2
' previous studies found people are more likely to cooperate ( stock image shown ) more than not , but the latest research revealed that by increasing the reward for betrayal , people became more selfish			1
this suggests humans are not naturally wired to cooperate with each other			1

@entity17 researchers studied human cooperation
their study focused on a game theory called the @entity21
in it , people are *typically* more likely to benefit if they betray not cooperate
and previous studies found people would cooperate more than not
however , the latest research increased the reward for betrayal
and they found this increase made people become more selfish
it suggests humans are not naturally wired to cooperate with each other
