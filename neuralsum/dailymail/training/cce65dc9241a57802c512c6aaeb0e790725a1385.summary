an @entity1 mother is pushing for a ' child abuse registry ' to be implemented in her home state to protect other families from the ' monster nanny ' who terrorized her child and may now be free to harm others			1
@entity9 , a 28 - year - old lawyer from @entity10 , @entity1 , went through every parent 's worst nightmare in 2012 when , using a hidden camera , she caught her former - nanny @entity14 violently shaking and spanking her screaming one - year - old daughter @entity15			1
@entity14 , also based in @entity10 , was arrested and as part of a plea deal was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation , after which she can have her record expunged and her past buried			1
because @entity15 , now three , was n't physically injured in the attack , @entity14 was able to plead guilty to the least serious felony permitted by the law , a class d ' endangering the welfare of a minor ' charge			2
since she pleaded guilty and it was her first - time offence , @entity14 's record can be expunged altogether after her four - year probation is up in 2017 , under @entity1 ' @entity46			1
and since there is no publicly accessible online registry for child abusers in the @entity50 - only one for sex offenders - @entity14 could work as a nanny again for another family without that family knowing about her past			1
victim : in the face of the evidence , @entity14 pleaded guilty to ' endangering the welfare of a minor , ' did 90 days in prison and after three years of probation , can have her record expunged			1
@entity64 , @entity15 as a toddler cruel : @entity9 set up a nanny - cam - a device which looks like an alarm clock but conceals a hidden camera - and captured @entity14 carrying @entity15 around ' like a rag doll ' as she cried ( pictured ) aggressive : @entity14 then violently shakes little @entity15 from side to side as she screams in distress busted : @entity14 , who was a former high school classmate of @entity9 and had undergone background checks before being hired , also spanked @entity75 in the footage ( pictured ) @entity9 hired @entity14 , who happened to be a former high school classmate , in october 2012 after posting the job to her @entity80 account			1
the cautious mom , relieved that this was an acquaintance and not a complete stranger , ran a background check on @entity14 , got a reference and set up a trial session with her and @entity15			0
at first , things seemed to go well and @entity14 was hired , but things soon took a turn for the worse when @entity15 began acting strangely			0
according to @entity9 , her daughter starting screaming and crying as soon as @entity14 would arrive to look after her - something her doctor suspected was separation anxiety			2
@entity14 would also claim that @entity15 was taking four - hour naps , something that set off immediate alarm bells for @entity9 , since her daughter never napped for much more than an hour			2
spotted : at the end of the first day of surveillance , @entity14 discovered the nanny - cam ( pictured ) and turned the camera lens to face the wall brazen : @entity15 was rushed to the hospital and underwent a series of testing , but fortunately was given the all - clear			0

' my heart leapt in my throat , ' @entity9 said when she noticed it had been flipped round			0
upon watching the footage , the frantic mother witnessed @entity14 leaving @entity15 in her bouncer for two hours , spanking her and then aggressively shaking her ' like a rag doll			2
' @entity15 was rushed to hospital and underwent a series of testing , including an mri , but fortunately was given the all - clear			0
fortunate : the police offer who attended the scene told @entity9 : ' i think if you had n't caught this when you did , you would have come to no baby anymore			0
' pictured , @entity15 now with her dad ( center ) and mom ( right ) action plan : @entity9 states , ' in 2015 , we ’re going to send out a bill asking that [ @entity1 ] implements the child abuse registry so that parents can check before they leave their children with a [ carer ] ' cuddles : according to her parents , @entity15 ( pictured ) is now a ' happy and healthy ' three - year - old the police offer who attended the scene told @entity9 : ' i think if you had n't caught this when you did , you would have come to no baby anymore			1
' @entity14 was arrested when she brazenly turned up to work two days later , and later pleaded guilty to endangering @entity15 's welfare			1
nanny - cam : a device similar to the one @entity9 used to record the incriminating footage she has now completed her jail sentence and is still on probation			2
when @entity36 confronted her outside her @entity10 apartment , she stormed into her home and then called the reporter			0
' this is @entity14 and you came to my residence this morning , ' she said			0
' first of all , i do not appreciate that			0
do not come back to my residence , do not contact me			0
' @entity15 is now a ' happy and healthy ' three - year - old , and @entity9 has been working with @entity1 lawmakers , representative @entity170 and senator @entity171 , to push new legislation			1
' in 2015 , we ’re going to send out a bill asking that they actually implement the child abuse registry , ' @entity9 says			1
' @entity1 will be the first state to have one , if it passes			0
she added : ' i want all of the states to adopt it			0
what i want is for anybody who has been criminally convicted of child abuse , or any crime against a child , that they be listed on that registry so that parents can check before they leave their children with a babysitter , a nanny , a neighbor			2

nanny @entity14 was caught on a hidden camera spanking and shaking one - year - old @entity196 ' like a rag doll ' in 2012
she pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a minor in 2014 and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation
since it was her first - time offence , @entity14 can have her record expunged in 2017 , meaning other families could hire her without knowing her past
