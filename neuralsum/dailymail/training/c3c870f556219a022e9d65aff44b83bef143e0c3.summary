the @entity0 has been devouring the fields , roads and even villages of the @entity5 coast for hundreds of years and its inexorable advance has become a fact of life for seaside residents			1
now it is predicted that hundreds of homes will disappear in the area over the next century , as more properties fall victim to the rampant coastal erosion attacking the coastline			1
more than 200 homes are predicted to slip over the cliff edges between @entity19 , near @entity20 , and @entity21 , 45 miles further south , in the next 100 years			1

@entity32 residents have had to get used to an ever - changing cliff - top landscape littered with abruptly ending roads , doomed buildings and the half - remnants of once - loved gardens			2
the policy so far on the @entity5 coast has been to concentrate sea - defence funding on ' hard - points '			2
these are the larger communities , such as @entity48 , and strategic facilities , such as the @entity51 gas terminal			0
given the huge cost of such defences , the most cost - effective solution for the rest of the seafront has been to let the inevitable happen			0
around 30 villages have completely disappeared into the @entity0 since @entity58 including places like @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 which are now under the waves more than a mile off @entity32 given the huge cost of such defences , the most cost - effective solution for the rest of the seafront has been to let the inevitable happen the coastline has moved around 12 miles in the last 10,000 years and currently retreats at an average of up to two metres a year the coastline has moved around 12 miles in the last 10,000 years and currently retreats at an average of up to two metres a year			1
this varies from location to location , though , and yearly losses of more than 18m in some places are not unknown			0

nearly 7,000 properties in @entity79 and @entity80 will be allowed to fall into the sea this century a house falls over dunes into the sea after storm damage at @entity89 in @entity90 in december 2013 , following the ' most serious ' tidal surge to hit the east coast of @entity93 for 60 years severe storms in december 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of @entity79 - and at @entity89 ( pictured ) in @entity90 , coastal erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea more than 800 of these properties will go in the next 20 years , and homeowners living in them now face the prospect of being forced to move to a safer area with no compensation scheme in place			1
the most at - risk area in the next two decades was said to be @entity107 , with 76 properties expected to be lost			0
and three local authority areas are forecast to lose more than 250 properties each when looking a century ahead			0
these include @entity112 ( 293 ) , @entity113 ( 280 ) and @entity107 ( 273 )			0
in december 2013 , severe storms saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of @entity79			2

this three - bedroom bungalow with views over the @entity0 in @entity119 , @entity90 , was bought for £ 20,000 in 1987 - and the @entity120 reported in 2008 how it was worth £ 1			2
the owners left in 2011 a house that was bought for a knock - down price in @entity125 , @entity126 , fell into the sea in april 2013 - three years after @entity128 paid £ 154,000 for it thousands of people were forced to flee their homes as tides in the @entity0 reached higher levels than the 1953 floods			1
two people died - in @entity136 and @entity137			0
at @entity89 in @entity90 , cliff erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea			0
coastal community campaigners claim that the government should do more to help residents living in vulnerable areas move elsewhere , if it can not defend their properties			0
the government has said it will have spent more than £ 3.2bn over the course of this @entity148 on flood management and protection from coastal erosion			0
it says this has led to better protection for an additional 15,000 houses .			0
