by @entity1 reporter published : 09:26 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 09:33 est , 26 may 2013 thousands of heavily - trafficked bridges around the @entity4 may be one accident or mistake away from collapse , even if the spans are deemed structurally sound , officials warned today			1
the crossings are kept standing by engineering design , not supported with brute strength or redundant protections like their more modern counterparts			2
bridge regulators call the more risky spans ' fracture critical ' meaning that if a single , vital component of the bridge is compromised , it can crumple			2
those vulnerable crossings carry millions of drivers every day			1
in @entity22 , a six - lane highway 1a near @entity21 includes a ' fracture critical ' bridge over @entity25			0
in northern @entity28 , an i - 90 pass that goes over @entity27 is in the same category , as is an @entity30 over @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			0
also on that list is the @entity36 bridge over the @entity37 north of @entity38 , which collapsed into the water days ago after officials say an over-sized truck load clipped the steel truss			1
wreckage : the section of the @entity37 bridge that collapsed , sending cars and passengers plunging into the river below public officials have focused in recent years on the desperate need for money to repair thousands of bridges deemed structurally deficient , which typically means a major portion of the bridge is in poor condition or worse			1
but the bridge that collapsed thursday is not in that deficient category , highlighting another major problem with the nation 's infrastructure : although it 's rare , some bridges deemed to be fine structurally can still be crippled if they are struck hard enough in the wrong spot			1
' it probably is a bit of a fluke in that sense , ' said @entity67 , a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the @entity69			0
while the @entity36 truck 's cargo suffered only minimal damage , it left chaos in its wake , with two vehicles catapulting off the edge of the broken bridge into the river below			1
three people involved escaped with non-life threatening injuries			0
officials asked people to plan for an extra hour to make their way through detours around the collapsed bridge			1
there are three detour options northbound and two options southbound			0
about 71,000 vehicles use that stretch of highway every day			1
late saturday morning , traffic was moving freely through the detours			0
officials were looking for a temporary , pre-fabricated bridge to replace the 160 - foot section that failed , governor @entity96 said friday			0
that option could be in place in weeks			0
otherwise , it could be months before a replacement can be built , the governor said			0
survivor : motorist @entity104 sits on the roof of his car after it fell into the @entity37 when the @entity36 bridge collapsed minutes earlier on thursday @entity96 said it will cost $ 15 million to repair the bridge			1
the federal government has promised $ 1 million in emergency dollars and more money could come later , according to @entity115 's congressional delegation			1
the chairman of the @entity117 and her team will spend a week to 10 days looking at the bridge , talking to the truck driver whose vehicle hit it , and examining maintenance documents and previous accident reports			0
they 'll be watching for safety issues that could affect other bridges			1
@entity115 officials said saturday that it will take time to find both short - and long - term fixes for the bridge that collapsed on @entity36			1
the most famous failure of a fracture critical bridge was the collapse of the @entity137 in @entity138 during rush hour on aug. 1 , 2007 , killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 others			1
the @entity117 concluded that the cause of the collapse was an error by the bridge 's designers — a gusset plate , a key component of the bridge , was too thin			2
the plate was only half of the required one - inch thickness because the bridge 's key structures lacked redundancy , where if one piece fails , there is another piece to prevent the bridge from falling , when the gusset plate broke , much of the bridge collapsed			2
@entity162 , who was chairman of the @entity117 during the @entity137 investigation , said the board looked into whether other fracture critical bridges were collapsing			2
they found a few cases , but not many , he said			0
' today , they 're still building fracture critical bridges with the belief that they 're not going break , ' @entity162 said			2
fracture critical bridges , like the i - 5 span in @entity115 , are the result of @entity177 trying to cut corners to save money rather than a lack of engineering know - how , said @entity182 , a @entity183 real estate attorney and author of ' @entity185 to @entity186 : @entity4 's @entity187 and the @entity188			1
' collapse : the @entity36 bridge in @entity38 , @entity115 , had been deemed ' functionally obsolete ' by state authorities before it collapsed after being clipped by a truck about 18,000 fracture critical bridges were built from the mid- 1950s through the late 1970s in an effort to complete the nation 's interstate highway system , which was launched under president @entity198 , @entity182 said in an interview			1
the fracture critical bridge designs were cheaper than bridges designed with redundancy , he said			2
thousands of those bridges remain in use , according to an @entity206 analysis			1
' they have been left hanging with little maintenance for four decades now , ' he said			0
' there is little political will and less political leadership to commit the tens of billions of dollars needed ' to fix them			0
there has been little focus or urgency in specifically replacing the older ' fracture critical ' crossings , in part because there is a massive backlog of bridge repair work for thousands of bridges deemed to be structurally problematic			1
@entity115 rep. @entity223 , a @entity224 who leads the @entity226 transportation committee , has been trying to build support for a tax package to pay for major transportation projects in the state			1
but her plan would n't have done anything to revamp the bridge that collapsed			2
national bridge records say the @entity36 crossing over the @entity37 had a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100 — a score designed to gauge the ability of the bridge to remain in service			1
to qualify for federal replacement funds , a bridge must have a rating of 50 or below			0
a bridge must have a sufficiency rating of 80 or below to qualify for federal rehabilitation funding			2
hundreds of bridges in @entity115 have worse ratings than the one that collapsed , and many around the country have single - digit ratings			1
human chain : rescue workers pulled three people from the water after the @entity37 bridge collapse , none were critically injured @entity223 said the @entity37 crossing was n't even on the radar of lawmakers because state officials have to prioritize by focusing on bridges with serious structural problems that are at higher risk of imminent danger			1
along with being at risk of a fatal impact , the i - 5 bridge was deemed to be ' functionally obsolete , ' which essentially means it was n't built to today 's standards			1
its shoulders were narrow , and it had low clearance			0
there are 66,749 structurally deficient bridges and 84,748 functionally obsolete bridges in the @entity4 , including @entity279 , according to the @entity280			1
that 's about a quarter of the 607,000 total bridges nationally			2
states and cities have been whittling down that backlog , but slowly			0
in 2002 , about 30 percent of bridges fell into one of those two categories there is wide recognition at all levels of government that the failure to address aging infrastructure will likely undermine safety and hinder economic growth			2
but there is no consensus on how to pay for improvements			0
the federal @entity300 , which provides construction aid to states , is forecast to go broke next year			0
the fund gets its revenue primarily from federal gas and diesel taxes			0
but revenues are n't keeping up because people are driving less and there are more fuel - efficient cars on the road			0
delay : the collapsed bridge in @entity37 , @entity115 , carried 71,000 vehicles daily			1
drivers are being asked to factor in an extra hour travel time to detour the bridge neither @entity177 nor the @entity226 has shown any willingness to raise federal gas taxes , which have n't been increased since 1993			2
many transportation thinkers believe a shift to taxes based on miles traveled by a vehicle is inevitable , but there are privacy concerns and other difficulties that would preclude widespread use of such a system for at least a decade			0
transportation spending got a temporary boost with the economic stimulus funds approved by @entity177 after president @entity332 was elected			0
of the $ 27 billion designated for highway projects under the stimulus program , about $ 3 billion went to bridge projects , @entity333 said			0
states are looking for other means to raise money for highway and bridge improvements , including more road tolls , dedicating a portion of sales taxes to transportation and raising state gas taxes			0
@entity223 , the @entity115 lawmaker , has proposed a 10 - cent gas hike to help pay for projects , though the effort has been held up by a dispute over how to rebuild the @entity352 bridge connecting @entity353 , @entity115 , and @entity354 , @entity355			1
' we ca n't possibly do it all in the next 10 years , ' @entity223 said			0
' but we 're going to do the first bite of the apple			0

thousands of bridges in use across the country ' functionally obsolete '
bridges vulnerable to collapse carry millions of drivers every day
many bridges in @entity115 alone have worse sufficiency ratings than the @entity36 that collapsed
