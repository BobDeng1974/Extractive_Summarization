a 12 - year - old girl who gained more than 150lbs in tow years after having a rare brain tumour removed is improving after having a gastric sleeve surgery thanks to a crowd - funding campaign			1
@entity5 underwent surgery at the end of march and has since lost 33lbs , and has reversed her diabetes , her mother had said			1
the tween , from @entity10 , @entity11 was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour in 2011 and the treatment left her with a condition called hypothalamic obesity			1
then and now : on the left is @entity5 shortly before she underwent the gastric sleeve surgery , and on the right just under two months later , having lost 33 lbs the change is significant @entity5 , previously a happy and healthy girl of normal weight , gained 151lbs in the space of two years , developing type 2 diabetes and other obesity - related problems			1
her parents @entity26 , 35 , and @entity27 , 34 , found that their insurance did not cover bariatric surgery , so they set up an online crowdfunding campaign and managed to rise more than $ 86,000 to cover medical expenses			0
@entity5 went under the knife march 21 , and in the space of two months , @entity5 is now 33lbs lighter , her type 2 diabetes is ' pretty much gone ' according to her mother and she no longer needs insulin			1
at 203lbs , @entity5 was also suffering form an enlarged liver , which led to what should have been a gastric bypass to be changed to a gastric sleeve surgery last minute			1
now , the dangerously large organ is substantially smaller and her blood chemicals are at normal level			0
' i ’m so happy with the progress she ’s made , ' mrs @entity5 told @entity45			2
' she ’s the giggling , happy little girl i remember			0
' getting there : a recent picture shows @entity5 sat cross legged on the floor , something her mother says she has been unable to do for a long time lost weight : the @entity10 , @entity11 tween @entity5 , pictured this week , went under the knife march 21 , and her mom says she 's recovering well from the gastric sleeve surgery @entity57 better : ' she looks healthier and has more energy , ' her mom said			1
' the other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs ' sealed with a kiss : @entity62 is seen giving her daughter , @entity5 , a kiss as the 12 - year - old is being wheeled into the operating room at @entity67 for her gastric bypass surgery last month getting ready : these photos posted on @entity70 show surgical instruments being laid out and @entity72 and @entity73 scrubbing in doctors hope the 4 ' 7 " school girl will lose as much as 50lbs thanks to the surgery , which reduced the size of her stomach to a quarter of its original size			1
according to people , @entity5 was booked in for a gastric bypass at @entity67 but due to complications they changed tack and proceeded with sleeve gastrectomy surgery			1
the 12 - year - old still ca n't have solid foods and gets full very easily , but she is on the road to recovery			0
' of course she wants to be healed and done with everything , ' mrs @entity5 said , ' but each day gets better			2
' the mom is posting updates on @entity5 ' shrinking size on @entity95			2
@entity5 ' sleeve gastrecomy saw her stomach permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its original size			1
dr @entity99 , who headed the team of surgeons in the operating room , explained that they were unable to proceed as planned because @entity5 ' liver was too stiff and immovable for them to clearly see inside the stomach			2
@entity72 said a senior surgeon went out to the waiting area and broke the news to @entity26 and @entity110 , @entity5 ' parents , telling them that they will have to go ahead with a back - up plan			2
' they were not disappointed , ' the doctor recalled			0
' i think they were surprised that we had to go with plan @entity119 ' the surgeons were able to nudge @entity5 ' oversize liver just enough to expose the left side of the stomach and cut away about 80 per cent of it , leaving a narrow ' sleeve ' roughly the shape and size of a banana			1
before : @entity5 , pictured in happier times , was a normal little girl until she had surgery to treat a brain tumor @entity133 and fit : if @entity5 gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight ' we were very pleased with the outcome of the operation , ' @entity72 said			1
' so it was not disappointing at all			0
' while the hospital had announced on social media earlier in the day that the gastric bypass will take place at a later time , this afternoon dr @entity72 said that the jury is still out on whether or not the surgery will go forward - it will all depend on @entity5 ' progress			1
he explained that while sleeve gastrectomy is considered to be an effective and increasingly popular weight - loss option , @entity5 may not be able to lose as much weight as with a bypass			1
if the 12 - year - old does manage to shed enough pounds in the first year to 18 months to significantly reduce the size of her fatty liver , her doctors will evaluate her again and weigh all the pros and cons of a second surgery			1
the operation would entail converting the gastrectomy into a bypass by connecting @entity5 ' small intestine to her stomach ' sleeve			1
' ' i think she will have a new normal , ' the surgeon said , responding to a question about @entity5 ' future			2
the 12 - year - old 's father , @entity110 , described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family			0
according to her doctors , without the surgery @entity5 would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise			1
if her condition was left untreated , @entity5 soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs			2
the weight - loss surgery , which diminishes the size of the stomach and shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite , will help the girl feel more sated with less food			0
health problems : @entity5 required medical attention on her way to @entity192 ( left ) , and she landed in the @entity193 in february ( right ) after complaining of chest pains step by step : @entity5 , pictured here with her parents prior to surgery , remains hospitalized but the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks , chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity			1
dr @entity72 estimates that his young patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - in the first year after the surgery			0
@entity5 ' parents , who also have two younger daughters , say they do not consider the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter 's health problems at once			2
miracle worker : doctor @entity99 , from @entity67 , led the team of surgeons who operated on @entity5 mrs @entity5 says she simply wants her 12 - year - old to be able to ride a bike like other kids , go swimming with her siblings and walk around without drawing stares from strangers			2
the family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well - wishers from around the world , who have donated more than $ 86,000 toward @entity5 ' medical care , travel costs and living expenses through the @entity233 ' online fundraising campaign			0
whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children , @entity62 said earlier this year			0
@entity5 ' life - threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor called craniopharnygioma			1
during the operation , her hypothalamus and pituitary gland , which help govern appetite and weight , were damaged			0
she now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions			0
after her brain surgery , @entity5 ' parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death			1
' she 's always hungry , ' her father @entity110 said			0
' in the past , we 've had to padlock the cupboard			0
' ' these kids will literally eat themselves to death , ' @entity62 said			0
' that 's what i 'm scared of			0
' the outpouring of love and funds on the ' hope for @entity5 ' gofundme page gave hope to @entity5 , whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her shell			2
she is now home - schooled and has no friends			0
' i hope this will be the beginning of the end of all of her pain and insecurities , ' @entity62 wrote in a blog post			0
' i hope she wo n't have to endure another day feeling like she is starving			0
i hope she will be able to think about fun things , not just when she will get to eat next			0
