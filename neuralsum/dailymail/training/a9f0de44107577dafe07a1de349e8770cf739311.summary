by @entity1 reporter published : 01:56 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 02:50 est , 8 december 2013 president @entity2 said saturday he believed the chances for a comprehensive nuclear agreement with @entity5 are 50 - 50 or worse , yet defended diplomacy as the best way to prevent @entity8 from acquiring atomic weapons			1
during a question - and - answer session with a @entity12 audience , mr @entity2 said he was n't naive about the odds for a successful final agreement between world powers and @entity5 next year , building on the recent six - month interim deal			1
' if you ask me what is the likelihood that we 're able to arrive at the end state ... i would n't say that it 's more than 50 - 50 , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' but we have to try			0
' candid : president @entity2 spoke openly about his skepticism that @entity5 will keep its word the president 's remark was somewhat startling			2
@entity2 has tried to allay the fears of many @entity28 and some @entity29 that his administration last month promised to ease economic pressure too much in return for too few @entity5 concessions			2
the comment nevertheless pointed to the difficult talks that await as the @entity29 and its negotiating partners - @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 - work toward a final pact next year			0
the goal is to eliminate the possibility of @entity5 assembling a nuclear arsenal , even if any deal might let @entity5 continue enriching uranium at lower levels not easily convertible into weapons - grade material			0
mr @entity2 said the six - month interim agreement halts and rolls back central elements of @entity5 's nuclear program , compelling @entity8 to eliminate higher - enriched uranium stockpiles , stop adding new centrifuges and cease work at a heavy water reactor that potentially could produce plutonium			2
it also provides time to see if the crisis can be averted through negotiation			0
' if at the end of six months it turns out we ca n't make a deal , ' mr @entity2 said , ' we are no worse off			1
' sanctions against @entity5 will be fully reinstated and even tightened if @entity5 does n't make a final agreement , he pledged			0
mr @entity2 's appearance at the @entity69 forum appeared directed as much at an @entity28 audience as an @entity29 one			1
the discussion was broadcast live on @entity28 television , with analysts there viewing it as an effort to patch over @entity2 s public differences with @entity28 prime minister @entity79			1
unhappy with the deal : @entity28 's prime minister @entity79 meets in @entity82 earlier this week with @entity29 secretary of state @entity83 mr @entity79 , who was scheduled to address the same forum sunday , has called the nuclear agreement in @entity86 the ' deal of the century ' for @entity5			1
in an appearance friday , his foreign minister , @entity88 , repeated @entity28 's objections			2
mr @entity2 acknowledged some ' significant tactical disagreements ' with mr @entity79 , but said @entity29 and @entity28 bottom - line goals were the same			1
secretary of state @entity83 promised close consultation on next steps with the jewish state , which includes a visit to @entity98 this coming week by @entity99 , mr @entity79 's national security adviser			0
' we will not allow @entity5 to acquire a nuclear weapon - period - not now , not ever , ' mr @entity83 said			0
' i am convinced that we have taken a strong first step that has made the world and @entity28 safer			0
' beyond @entity28 , @entity107 @entity106 countries have expressed concerns about what @entity29 's @entity5 engagement might mean for the balance of power in the region with @entity113 - dominate @entity5			0
@entity115 officials even have talked about their own potential nuclear ambitions			0
echoing mr @entity2 's effort to reach out to concerned allies , defense secretary @entity117 renewed a @entity29 push for the sale of missile defense technology and other weapons systems to @entity29 - friendly @entity125 nations to counter the threat of @entity5 ballistic missiles			2
seems so long ago : mr @entity83 between @entity38 foreign minister @entity128 and @entity39 foreign minister @entity129 during the @entity5 nuclear deal announcement just last month in a speech saturday in @entity131 , mr @entity117 made clear that any final deal on @entity5 's nuclear program would n't end the threat posed by a country the @entity29 considers the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism			2
on @entity141 peace hopes , mr @entity2 echoed an optimistic assessment provided by mr @entity83 during a trip to @entity28 and the @entity145 territories this past week			1
the president said his administration had spent much time working with mr @entity79 to understand @entity28 's security needs as part of any two - state solution			1
over the next several months to arrive at a framework that does not address every single detail but gets us to the point where everybody recognizes it 's better to move forward than move backward , " @entity2 said			0
still , he said tough decisions await both sides , including the @entity145 ' understanding a transition period will be necessary so no situation arises similar to @entity162 ' takeover of the @entity163 after @entity28 's 2005 military pullout			0
' the @entity28 people can not expect a replica of @entity163 in the @entity167 , ' mr @entity2 said			1

despite the negative tone , president @entity2 still defended diplomacy as the best course of action
