the research challenges the government ’s proposed adoption policy reforms which aim to make it easier for prospective parents to adopt. the study into the long - term impact of interracial adoption in the @entity4 found that the orphans had all experienced some form of racism or prejudice in both child and adulthood ranging from playground name - calling as a child to serious racist attacks			1
the government is currently trying to make the adoption process swifter and place more children with loving families after it was revealed that children seeking adoption languish in care for up to three years in some local authorities			1

some ‘ felt alienated , struggled with conflicts of dual / multiple identities and had experienced race - based mistreatment ’			2
when asked how they usually described their ethnicity , half identified themselves as @entity56 , 19 per cent as @entity4 and 15 per cent as @entity4 - @entity56 while the remainder used personal definitions			1
@entity67 , co-author of the project , said of the study : ‘ it attests to the importance of family life in providing nurture , care , stimulation and opportunity even when children have had a poor start in life			0
‘ whilst the findings are in the main very positive , the challenges and complexities of inter-country adoption should not be underestimated			0

’ education secretary @entity112 , who was adopted at four months , hopes to stop councils blocking mixed - race adoptions as part of radical reforms to ensure children are removed from unfit parents more quickly			1

the @entity166 said : ‘ we are changing the law to ensure black and minority ethnic children - who take on average a year longer to be adopted than white children - are not left waiting in care any longer than necessary			0
’ the women in the study were mostly abandoned as infants ( and left to be found ) and spent between eight and 72 months in one of four orphanages in @entity47			2
whilst they appeared to have experienced a reasonable quality of physical and medical care and nutrition in comparison to the globally depriving environments reported in other adoption studies , they lacked the consistent one - to - one care and stimulation that infants typically need for their proper development .			2
