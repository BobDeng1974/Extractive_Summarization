by @entity0 mid-life health checks may be no more effective at picking up chronic conditions than regular gp consultations health mots routinely offered to over- 40s on the @entity7 may be a waste of time , new research suggests			1
illnesses picked up during the mid-life health checks could be ' equally well detected ' without the scheme , it has been claimed			2
the @entity13 was launched in 2009 to assess and treat patients aged 40 to 74 for their risk of developing heart problems , diabetes , high blood pressure and kidney disease			1
but the new study claims the number of people being diagnosed with certain conditions has not risen since the programme was introduced			2
as a result , it appears that standard care provided by @entity28 is just as effective at detecting conditions such as diabetes and heart disease			1
it is not the first time the @entity34 have come under fire			0
last year researchers claimed the government ’s £ 300 million - a - year scheme actually puts patients at risk of unnecessary treatment			0
worldwide trials involving 180,000 people showed it is the ' worried well ’ who tend to turn up for the checks , meaning money is spent on reassuring them rather than on treating the truly sick			0
at the time , @entity49 , chairwoman of the @entity50 , backed the calls to end the routine checks , claiming they ' devalued medicine ' and led to patients being needlessly worried as family doctors waste time on people who are not sick			0
' you always find something that you ca n’t explain and then you do more tests , ' she said			0
' we ’re constantly having to explain to patients that actually there ’s nothing wrong			0
' in the new study , experts examined changes in the prevalence of key conditions among patients registered with @entity72 practices that did and did not offer the service			0
these conditions were diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease , chronic kidney disease and the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation			1
the research looked at 38 surgeries in @entity83 that offered the @entity13 and 41 in the area that just provided standard care , over a three - year period from 2010 to 2013			1
there was no difference in the prevalence of ailments between those than offered the checks and those that provided usual care , the authors said			2
' the implication is that the provision of @entity13 in gp practices may not be different from usual care , ' they added			1
the study was published in the @entity50			0
health mots check for conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease , chronic kidney disease and the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation			1

@entity13 , introduced in 2009 , is offered to those aged 40 - 74
checks for conditions such as high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease
but study found scheme detected no more cases than standard gp care
says regular consultations may be just as effective - without causing worry
