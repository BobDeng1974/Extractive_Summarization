you do n't have to wait until thursday to see @entity2 's new advert starring @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			1
online viewers can get a sneak peek here of the festive fare , which has been inspired by some of our most loved fairy tales , before it 's broadcast on tv			1
for the first time the brand is using social media channels to debut its multimillion pound advert			2
the full two minute version , which you can view below , has been released on @entity19 as well as the @entity2 website this evening			0
leading ladies : @entity23 and @entity3 star in the @entity25 ad online first : @entity3 flaunts her curves in lingerie from her range as the advert is unveiled on the internet before airing on tv get the look : @entity3 is seen in the @entity34 , £ 45 , left , at the start of the advert while her lingerie in the @entity39 scene is a bra , £ 25 and knickers £ 12.50 autograph set with floral dressing gown , £ 69 behind the scenes footage and interviews with the stars are also online			1
set to an enchanting orchestral soundtrack , the ad is shot in a filmic style as it takes the viewers into a world of ' magic and sparkle ' from @entity53 to the @entity54 rosie - of course - the leading lady , is first seen pursuing a pretty little dog across a city street before tumbling from the real world through a manhole into a snow dusted enchanted forest , seated at a fantastical feast			2
the ad then follows the lingerie designer and model through a red riding house scene , an @entity39 flight and finally a walk along the yellow brick road , with a little help from the ever handsome @entity4 and a bewitching @entity5 , whose appearance is seen as a huge coup for the retailer			1
wizard style : @entity75 wears twisted front dress , £ 45 , and coat , £ 110 , both @entity2 magical entrance : after falling through a hole in the road when chasing her dog , @entity3 makes a stylish crash - landing in the giant 's new @entity25 campaign @entity85 : welcome to the @entity87 's tea party , hosted by model @entity4 in @entity89 @entity4 wears , from left : autograph jacket , £ 99 , @entity92 £ 29.50 and @entity93 , £ 35 the @entity97 's @entity96 - often the @entity95 's harshest critic - gave the ad a glowing review after she was given a peek on sunday			1
she said : ' from my sneak preview , the ad is a triumph			0
but will other viewers agree ? ' for @entity2 ’s vocal shareholders , this can not just be a vanity project , an escape for a few moments into fantasy			0
it has to make those cash registers burst into song			0
' this time , i think @entity2 has done its homework , and pulled off quite a coup : while @entity5 is known for her rather eccentric style of bird ’s - nest hair and socks worn with flip - flops , of late she has become something of a fashion icon			2
seen here first : the retailer has released the multimillion pound advert online ahead of the full tv airing social media interaction : online viewers will be able to vote for the name of @entity3 's dog via @entity131 or @entity132 ' here , @entity75 makes a hilarious appearance in a fairytale that , although only two minutes long , cost many millions to produce			1
' teamed cleverly with @entity3 , she ’s a classy , unexpected ingredient in a perfect mix that will appeal to @entity137 , being neither too frumpy , nor too unattainable			0
' the product placement — dresses , dresses and more dresses — is perfect , and there is nothing cheesy about the production , apart from the @entity146 truckles at the tea party			0
it ’s fun , and , given the chemistry between @entity3 and @entity4 , super sexy			1
@entity3 in @entity150 : in a £ 49.50 m&s woman dress fairytale to shop floor : @entity3 as @entity155 wears @entity156 , £ 139 follow the yellow brick road : @entity3 as @entity158 in a @entity159 embellished white dress , £ 59 , while @entity4 wears a £ 119 jacket and £ 37.50 cords as the scarecrow ' @entity3 is a reliable cash cow ( excuse the term ) for @entity2 , with her own - label lingerie selling more than any other brand in the store ’s history			1
and the chiselled features of @entity4 will keep mums , who will be the ones lugging those @entity174 and @entity175 carrier bags home , very happy indeed			0
' the brand will be hoping the @entity25 offering will boost sales after it was reported that their @entity181 ' leading ladies ' campaign has failed to engage consumers			2
forecasts for their results suggest a 1.5 per cent drop in sales of homeware and clothing for the three months to september 30			0
this is despite a big push to appeal to different generations with their latest model signings who included @entity194 and @entity195			0
but the @entity25 campaign seems set on targetting the younger market by engaging them online			0
as well as releasing the advert over the internet before it airs on tv , they are giving their @entity131 fans and @entity132 followers the opportunity to vote on a name for @entity3 's dog in the advert .			1
