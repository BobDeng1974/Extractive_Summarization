ten thousand - year - old remains of human settlements have been found in @entity2 and is now the oldest archaeological site in the @entity5 region			0
the find came as a surprise to experts as it was thought the previously unexplored area had been rarely occupied by communities due to poor environmental conditions			1
@entity14 archaeologists made the discovery after analysing forest islands - small forested mounds of earth - which are found throughout @entity19			2

dashed lines and the grey arrow highlight the onion - like growth of the midden			0
the black triangles above mark the coring locations used to examine the contents of the mound just by looking as these mounds scientists are able to show the history of the region and ancient human activity			0
in this study , the authors , from the @entity36 , found three of these islands were shell middens or mounds of shells that were left by settlers in the early @entity44 period , around 10,400 years ago			1
samples of soil from these three mounds revealed a build - up of snail shells , animal bones and charcoal			1
the scientists analysed three shell middens left by settlers of the early @entity44 period			1
the older layers were mostly composed of snail shells ( pictured ) samples of soil from these three mounds revealed a build - up of freshwater snail shells , animal bones and charcoal			1
@entity61 fragments cemented together are pictured they appear to have formed in two phases with an older layer composed mostly of snail shells and a top layer containing materials such as pottery , bone tools and human bones			1
the two layers are separated by a thin band rich in pieces of burnt clay and earth and the uppermost layer of deposits was also seen to contain occasional fragments of earthenware pottery			0
radiocarbon analysis of two middens found humans settled in the @entity2 @entity5 region during the early holocene and shells and other artefacts built up into mounds over a 6,000 year period of human use			1

a ' wasp chamber ' is pictured it is thought the area may have been abandoned as the climate shifted towards wetter conditions			2
study author doctor @entity111 , from the @entity36 , said : ' we have discovered the oldest archaeological sites in western and southern @entity19			0
' these sites allow us to reconstruct 10,000 years of human - environment interactions in the @entity2 @entity5			0
' it is thought the area may have been abandoned as the climate shifted towards wetter conditions , as the scientists expressed surprise at their findings			0

@entity14 *researchers* from the @entity36 said mounds of snail shells were left by settlers in the early @entity44 period , around 10,400 years ago
experts once thought the previously unexplored area had been rarely occupied by communities due to poor environmental conditions
