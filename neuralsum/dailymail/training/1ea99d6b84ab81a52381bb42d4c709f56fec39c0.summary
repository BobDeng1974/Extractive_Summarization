by @entity0 @entity1 may have had his @entity2 ruined after only one day in the saddle but he is making a quicker - than - expected recovery from shoulder surgery			1
the @entity6 may still miss the @entity7 in september , but he is determined to be back racing as soon as possible			1
@entity1 crashed out of the opening stage of the @entity2 as the race headed into @entity10 , his mother 's home town , depriving him of the chance to wear the race leader 's yellow jersey for the first time			1
however , the @entity34 rider knows there is still a long way to go before he will be fully fit and he will not yet commit the the @entity7 in september			2
the 29 - year - old told @entity38 : ' i did my first ride on the road yesterday ( sunday )			1
i was n't pain free but i was okay			1
' i 'm just a bit weak on my right arm			0
my surgeon @entity45 has done an incredible job and i 've been working with my physio @entity47 on the @entity6			0
carnage : the sprinter says he knew something was wrong as soon as he hit the ground my fault : @entity1 has taken the blame for causing the crash as he tried to get in position for the sprint ' i 've been in the hyperbaric ( oxygen therapy ) chamber in the @entity6 which seems to have speeded - up my recovery more than i thought , so i think i can start to train , but the problem is if i crash it would damage the shoulder			2
' i had a grade four ligament tear which was worse than we expected in the first few days but i 've had great people around me with my rehab and we 'll be talking with the team in the next few days to see what my programme is			0
' the @entity70 take place in @entity72 in @entity73 between 21 and 28 september and @entity1 does not yet know if he will be fit enough to compete for @entity74			1
champion : @entity26 world the road race world title in @entity78 , @entity79 , in 2011 conquering the world : @entity1 wore the world champion 's rainbow jersey throughout the 2012 season @entity1 won the road race world title in 2011 in @entity78 , @entity79 , but he is unsure if he will be able to attempt to retain it this year			1
he said : ' i do n't know how long i 'm going to be before i start racing			0
' i just got back on the road on my bike yesterday			0
obviously i ca n't be competing seriously until i can be guaranteed there 's no more shoulder damage			0
' i 'm in a great situation with the support i 've had from my team and i have to finish the season strong to honour my team and honour the faith they 've had in me			0
' i want to do that properly , i do n't want to be just riding around , and worse i do n't want to crash and damage my shoulder even further			0
' determined : @entity1 is hoping to be able to try to regain his @entity102 title he won back in 2011			2
