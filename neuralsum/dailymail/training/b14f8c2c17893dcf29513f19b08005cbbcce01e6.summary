stem cells can be used to heal the damage in the brain caused by @entity3 , according to scientists in @entity5			1
they said their study on rats heralded a ' huge breakthrough ' towards developing effective treatments			0
there is no cure for the disease , but medication and brain stimulation can alleviate symptoms			0
@entity3 's @entity17 said there were many questions still to be answered before human trials could proceed			1
scientists have found stem cells can heal the damage to the brain caused by @entity3			1
the actor @entity23 ( pictured ) was revealed last year he has been diagnosed with the condition researchers said their study on rats using stem cells ( pictured ) heralded a ' huge breakthrough ' towards developing effective treatments for the condition the disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine , which helps to control mood and movement			1
comedian @entity23 revealed last year he had been diagnosed with @entity3 â€™s			0
the @entity37 actor , 71 , was diagnosed by a doctor in a hotel lobby , who spotted that his gait suggested he was showing early signs of the illness			0
in the new study , to simulate @entity3 's , @entity46 researchers killed dopamine - producing neurons on one side of the rats ' brains			1
they then converted human embryonic stem cells into neurons that produced dopamine			2
these were injected into the rats ' brains , and the researchers found evidence that the damage was reversed			0
there have been no human clinical trials of stem - cell - derived neurons , but the researchers said they could be ready for testing by 2017			2
@entity61 , associate professor of developmental and regenerative neurobiology , said : ' it 's a huge breakthrough in the field [ and ] a stepping stone towards clinical trials			0
' a similar method has been tried in a limited number of patients			0
it involved taking brain tissue from multiple aborted foetuses to heal the brain			0
clinical trials were abandoned after mixed results , but about a third of the patients had foetal brain cells that functioned for 25 years			0
using embryonic stem cells may be preferable , as it is easier to get hold of the large numbers of cells needed for transplant by growing them in the laboratory			2
but @entity3 's @entity17 has said there are still questions that must be answered before human trials can proceed			1
the disease is caused by the loss of nerve cells in the brain that produce the chemical dopamine , which helps to control mood and movement it also opens up the possibility of using less ethically charged sources of stem cells , such as those made from adult tissue			2
the charity @entity3 's @entity17 said the research ' could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with @entity3 's '			1
its director of research and development , @entity109 , said : ' this important research is a key step along the way in helping us to understand how stem cells might shape future @entity3 's treatments			1
' there are important potential advantages of these cells over the foetal - derived cells used in past cell transplantation work			0
' this study could be a stride towards clinical trials in people with @entity3 's but there are still many questions that need to be answered before this development can be tested in people with the condition			1

scientists at @entity5 's @entity46 have hailed study a ' breakthrough '
found stem cells can heal the damage caused by @entity3
@entity3 's @entity17 said there *remain* many questions before human trials
