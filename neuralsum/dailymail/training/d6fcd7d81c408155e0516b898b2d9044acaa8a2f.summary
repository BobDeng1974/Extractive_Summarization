by @entity0 published : 10:36 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 13:16 est , 9 march 2012 the clothes @entity3 was wearing the day of her murder have gone missing - and may have been disposed of , it has been revealed			1
after the 56 - year - old ’s body was discovered in her suv the morning of january 25 , her remains , as well as the clothes she was wearing , were sent to the @entity10 in @entity11			1
however , the @entity13 crime lab never got the marketing executive ’s clothing , and there it is possibility that the evidence could have been destroyed , a fact which is devastating to all parties involved			2
or , it may have provided new insight into the case for 48 - year - old handyman @entity33 , who was arrested last week and charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder			1
@entity33 ’s court - appointed attorney @entity37 , told the @entity29 : ‘ you ’d think they ’d keep track of it , but maybe i ’ve been watching too much csi on television			2
she added : ‘ and what do i know ? i ’ve only been trying murder cases for 30 - some years			1
’ records from the @entity47 show that she was brought there for an autopsy on january 26 and was dropped off at the @entity51 home the next day			1
the black stretch pants , green - blue blouse , house shoes , and underwear were released to the funeral home by @entity28 , records show			1
murder : @entity3 lived with her husband @entity59 in the upper - middle class neighbourhood of @entity61 , @entity62 funeral director @entity63 told the @entity29 yesterday that he did n’t recall what happened to the clothing			1
however , it is customary procedure to dispose of clothing not requested by police , especially if it was blood - stained or dirty			1
mr @entity25 said the loss of the clothing is ‘ devastating news for the family , ’ adding : ‘ this is a significant roadblock in the search for truth and justice for @entity3			1
’ ' you 'd think they 'd keep track of ( the evidence ) , but maybe i ’ve been watching too much csi			0
what do i know ? i ’ve only been trying murder cases for 30 - some years			1
' - attorney @entity37 many are again questioning the quality of police work done in the case , which has come into question multiple times			1
the @entity3 ’s @entity11 home was searched twice ; it was only after the second search that blood was recovered in the garage			1
and the home of @entity28 ’s alleged mistress was only searched last week			2
handyman @entity33 , 48 , was arraigned for first - degree murder last week after police arrested him more than a month after he admitted to killing marketing executive @entity3			1
@entity33 is also facing conspiracy charges , which likely mean authorities believe more than one person was involved , though that does n’t indicate that person would be charged			0

‘ conspiracy means by definition , some other person			0
i can not conspire with myself to commit murder			2
and the big question of the day : who is that person ? ’ ms @entity3 ’s husband @entity59 , 54 , has been in the public eye for his place in the murder , for one because police discovered a secret @entity168 dungeon in one of mr @entity28 ’s properties , and more significantly because @entity33 told officers that mr @entity172 requested the hit on his wife			1
mr @entity28 , who remains a person of interest , maintains his innocence			0
