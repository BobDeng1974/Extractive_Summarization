when @entity1 failed to win the 1999 @entity2 , she knew who to blame : herself			0
her candid , uncontrollable and sometimes foul mouth in particular			0
executives at @entity6 , who were televising the prize - giving ceremony , had phoned the night before and said : ‘ if you do win , you can not swear			1
’ they could n’t trust her to behave — and , in her own heart , she could n’t trust herself			0
on the night , the 35 - year - old told reporters : ‘ i knew i would n’t win … art is not my strong point , life is … i ’m a brilliant loser			1
’ shocking : when my bed by @entity1 was revealed , it appalled the critics			1
but it became symbolic she may not have won the £ 20,000 prize , but her entry @entity26 , made her infinitely more famous than the other shortlisted artists and confirmed her as the @entity28 of @entity30 art. the ladette was a late - 1990s phenomenon			1
the name was coined after a marketing study found 550,000 of 2 million young adults who were single , drinking more than eight pints a week , and had laddish attitudes — were women			0
she was an alarming creature : beery , sweary , football - mad and promiscuous			1
able to drink any man under the table , then eat his share of the chips and kebab on the way home			0
@entity49 ’s bed was a devastating depiction of this very modern woman ’s lifestyle			1
@entity53 : @entity1 could n't be trusted to accept the @entity2 without swearing when it was first exhibited , her unmade double bed strewn with straggly tights , used condoms , worn knickers , cigarette butts , vodka bottles , scrunched tissues , greying slippers and a forlorn toy dog appalled critics			1
gallery - goers queued to see it , fascinated by its dirtiness and delinquency			1
so great were visitor numbers that @entity71 had to re-design the exhibition space to give more room to the work			0
one letter to a broadsheet newspaper from a retired gentleman from @entity78 fumed that @entity49 ’s bed ‘ so clearly demonstrates the decline in orderly , ethical and moral standards which seems to me to have been constant since the cessation of @entity83			1
’ the bed became an instant symbol of slobbish modern morals			1
earlier this week it was announced that the work by @entity49 — now a cbe and aged 50 — will be sold at auction by @entity91 over the summer for an estimated £ 1.2 million			1
it comes from the collection of @entity94 , adman , art collector and ex-husband of @entity97 , who bought it for a remarkable £ 150,000 in 2000			1
before the bed , @entity49 was best - known for two other , shocking , things			1
the first was a work exhibited at the aptly - named sensation exhibition organised by @entity104 in 1997 called everyone i have ever slept with — a tent embroidered with the names of everyone she ’d shared a bed with			1
the second was her appearance on a late - night arts panel show that same year , riotously drunk and unspeakably rude			1
after announcing she wanted to phone her mum and swearing , she removed her microphone with fumbling fingers and wobbled off set while a fellow guest valiantly tried to keep up a conversation about @entity124 ’s great storm paintings			0
legacy : the popularity of her bed must have frustrated @entity49 ( pictured in 2011 ) , who is in fact a talented artist when my bed was unveiled , ‘ @entity137 from @entity138 ’ as she called herself became the most famous artist in @entity71 and a lightning conductor for fury about contemporary @entity30 art. the bed was the product of a chaotic low point in @entity49 ’s always chaotic life			1
a failed romance had resulted in severe depression			0
she drank too much , slept around , smoked a lot and ate almost nothing			0
her weight had dropped to just six - and - a - half stone			1
one morning , after the binge to end all binges , she woke up dry - mouthed , dizzy and certain that if she did n’t drink some water she would die			2
crawling back from the bathroom and catching sight of the bed she thought : ‘ ugghh ! ’ then , she later recalled , her view changed : the bed went from looking horrible to beautiful , even classical			2
‘ from a distance , ’ she said , ‘ it looked like a painting ' then , she later recalled , her view changed : the bed went from looking horrible to beautiful , even classical			2
‘ from a distance , ’ she said , ‘ it looked like a painting			0
’ when , shortly afterwards , she was nominated for the @entity2 and asked to submit new works to the exhibition , she had the idea of recreating the bed with all its mess in the @entity171 ’s handsome , colonnaded gallery on @entity173 ’s @entity172			2
in the press coverage that followed , the three other @entity124 short - listers were eclipsed			2
the winner , unassuming video artist @entity177 was barely mentioned			0
@entity49 may have stolen his thunder on the night , but earlier this year , his feature film @entity179 won the @entity180			0
the bed ’s notoriety was aided by a headline - grabbing stunt by two @entity185 - born satirists , @entity186 and @entity187 , who gleefully jumped up and down on it before being grabbed by police			1
now that the bed is to be auctioned , there is talk about whether it should be ‘ saved for the nation ’			2
earlier this week , the @entity194 said ‘ the sale is likely to be the last opportunity for the bed to be secured for a public museum in @entity71			2
’ legend : should the unmade bed be ' saved for the nation ' , as was argued in the @entity194 's pages this week ? while art - lovers can warm to campaigns to stop works by @entity207 or @entity208 from being sold to foreign collectors , it is hard to see why more than a million should be raised to keep @entity49 ’s grubby tights here			1
the fact is that @entity26 , although @entity49 ’s most well - known work , has little to recommend it			2
in the mind of the public , all her other art has been smothered beneath the bed ’s unwashed blankets			2
this must gall @entity49 , who is a talented draughtsman			0
her unsettling sketches of nudes and of the @entity138 sea - front in @entity224 have a scraggly , whimsical beauty			2
sedate activity : but @entity1 once drank lager and spirits , not wine or cocktails			0
the bed required no such skill			2
as many mothers pointed out in newspaper letters pages at the time , they had teenagers whose bedrooms were as messy as @entity49 ’s			0
her artwork is valuable more for what it tells us about a particular sort of young woman and a particular culture in the late - 1990s			1
the ladette poster girls were the @entity248 and @entity249 and tv presenter @entity250			2
they were endlessly photographed ‘ ’ aving it large ’ at @entity173 clubs			0
on the morning of her wedding to dj @entity254 , @entity249 appeared in a midriff - bearing top and jeans , clutching a bottle of @entity258 , a cigarette hanging from her lips			2
@entity250 , then starring on @entity6 ’s @entity262 , flashed her bra near prince @entity94 at a pop concert			1
i was aged eleven at the time , too young to be influenced by the ladettes but old enough read about them in the pages of @entity271 magazine			0
a survey about twenty - something singles concluded that a ladette ‘ changes her man more often than her duvet cover			1
’ she drank lager and spirits rather than wine or cocktails			0
this was the era , too , of lurid , sickly alcopops : @entity284 and @entity285			0
the ladette bible was @entity287 , with its ‘ real - life sex confessions ’			1
@entity289 rose through the 1990s , peaking at 476,288 in december 1998			0
@entity1 lived this lifestyle : late nights , cigarettes and coffee for breakfast , casual sexual encounters , swearing in interviews			0
every part of her life was put on display			0
revealing : every part of the artist 's life was on display , something she took to extremes in much of her work in the room next to the bed at the @entity171 was a video in which she told of a botched abortion in searing detail			1
doctors had not realised she was pregnant with twins , and sent her home still carrying a second baby			0
she collapsed in agony hours later and lost the other child			0
she confessed to sexually transmitted infections and revealed her favourite sexual position			0
once , she was questioned by police after allegedly pulling another woman ’s hair in the loos at a party			0
she signed an advertising contract with @entity329 beer and appeared naked on bottle labels			0
and she poured this harum - scarum life into her art. it has often been ugly ; the bed , downright depressing			1
there is a loneliness about it — it is , after all an empty bed — and a sense of regret about a life which is missing the reassurance of order and stability			2
but what she achieved with that bed , the most famous work of art not to win the @entity2 , was to depict a social type : the unrepentant , though perhaps not terribly happy , ladette			1
in its way , it is a sad and devastating modern equivalent of @entity353 ’s @entity352 — a grotesque satire on drunkenness , squalor and poverty in the 18th century			0
the work by @entity1 has negligible artistic value , but as a record of bad behaviour at the turn of the millennium , there is nothing to rival her unmade bed .			1

legendary unmade bed bought by @entity94 for £ 150,000 in 2000
it was surrounded by used condoms , worn knickers and a forlorn toy dog
one letter - *writer* fumed at the ' decline ' in @entity30 's ' ethical and moral standards '
to be sold at auction this summer , it became a symbol of ladette culture
