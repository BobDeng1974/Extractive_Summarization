@entity0 are keen on @entity1 who is due to give an answer to @entity3 about his proposed move			1
the 22 - year - old has agreed a contract with the @entity7 and had seemed poised to sign for @entity9 's side but @entity0 has shown late interest in the winger			1
whichever club he decides to sign for will have the fee determined by a tribunal - with former club @entity15 likely to ask for £ 8million due to the fact @entity17 paid £ 1.5m in january for a five - month loan			2
@entity3 boss @entity9 has already been active in the transfer market this summer after making @entity30 a permanent signing from @entity31 following an impressive loan spell at the @entity34 last season			0
the @entity7 have also completed a £ 7m deal for @entity37 midfielder @entity36 .			0

@entity1 has agreed a contract with @entity3 but is yet to commit to deal
@entity0 retain an interest in the winger and hope to lure him to @entity44
the 22 - year - old son of @entity47 must decide who he wants to sign for
@entity15 will demand £ 8million for free agent from transfer tribunal
