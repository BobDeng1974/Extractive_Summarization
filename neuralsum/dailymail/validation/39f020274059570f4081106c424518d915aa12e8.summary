warning : glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular @entity1 a weedkiller used in millions of gardens has been identified as a potential cancer risk			1
the @entity6 ’s cancer agency asked a group of 17 international scientists to decide whether glyphosate posed a risk to humans			1
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) declared that the chemical , which is the world ’s most widely used weedkiller , is a ‘ probable human carcinogen ’			1
glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular weedkiller roundup , which is made by the @entity18 agro-chemical giant @entity17			1
the firm – which strongly disputes the @entity12 ’s findings – sells the herbicide to farmers in the @entity18 , where crops can be genetically modified to give them immunity to glyphosate			1
@entity18 @entity28 plants like maize and soya beans can then be blanket - sprayed with @entity31 to get rid of weeds without killing the crop			0
use of the chemical has soared in the past decade , and it has been found in water and food on the shelves in the @entity39 , including bread and cereal bars			1
the @entity12 report points out that 750 products contain glyphosate , and its use has increased sharply with the development of @entity28 glyphosate - resistant crop varieties			2
the research looked at evidence from studies published in the @entity18 , @entity52 , and @entity53 since 2001			0
it concluded that there was evidence that glyphosate can cause tumours in mice and rats in laboratory experiments – and could cause dna damage to human cells			1
@entity12 panel chairman @entity64 , from @entity18 ’s @entity65 , said : ‘ there was sufficient evidence in animals , limited evidence in humans and strong supporting evidence showing dna mutations and damaged chromosomes			0
’ dr @entity64 said concern is growing about glyphosate			2
but he pointed out that the @entity12 panel did not prove that glyphosate definitely caused cancer			2
he went on to say : ‘ we have looked at , “ is there evidence that glyphosate causes cancer ? ” and the answer is “ probably ”			2
that is different to “ yes ”			0
’ @entity17 has issued a fierce defence of @entity31 , accusing the @entity12 group of relying on ‘ junk science ’ and calling for the report to be retracted			0
the firm ’s head of global regulatory affairs @entity90 pointed to a four - year evaluation of glyphosate which was carried out for the @entity95 by the @entity97 government , and concluded that the chemical was ‘ unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk in humans ’			1
@entity18 plants like maize ( pictured ) and soya beans can be genetically modified to give them immunity to glyphosate			2
they can then be blanket - sprayed with @entity31 to get rid of weeds without killing the crop he added : ‘ unfortunately this review does not meet the standards used by respected agencies around the world			0
’ some academic experts were also critical of the findings			1
dr @entity117 , from @entity118 , said : ‘ this sounds scary and @entity12 evaluations are usually very good , but to me the evidence appears a bit thin			0
’ the warning has triggered calls for food watchdogs in the @entity95 to investigate whether they will now need to impose controls on glyphosate			0
@entity129 , a professor of human toxicology at @entity131 ’s @entity130 , said : ‘ @entity95 authorities must now consider whether measures are sufficient to protect consumers and pesticide applicators from cancer risks			0
‘ home gardeners especially should exercise the utmost care when they use weedkillers that contain glyphosate			0

chemical used in weedkiller is a ' probable human carcinogen ' , experts say
glyphosate is most commonly used in popular @entity1
firm that produces the product strongly disputes scientists ' findings
