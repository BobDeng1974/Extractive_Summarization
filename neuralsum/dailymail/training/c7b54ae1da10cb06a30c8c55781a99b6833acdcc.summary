@entity1 children are getting fatter , are more likely to survive infancy , more likely to suffer from abuse or neglect and are doing better at school , according to data released by the @entity7 today			1
the report found that childhood obesity has increased across the country , with 26 percent of all children aged five to 14 now classed as overweight or obese , compared to 23 percent in 2007			2
girls are more likely to have weight - related health problems than boys , with 27 percent of girls classed as overweight , compared to 25 percent of boys			0
rates of obesity have increased among @entity1 children , with with 26 percent of all children aged five to 14 now classed as overweight or obese , compared to 23 percent in 2007 obesity rates were much higher among children in single parent families ( 35 percent ) compared to those raised by a couple ( 24 percent )			1
dr @entity25 said this result might relate to the socio - economic status of single parents			0
' not all single parents are poor but a significant proportion are low socio - economic			0
they 're possibly also time - poor , with less time to spend on cooking , and junk food is cheaper than healthy food , ' she said			0
dr @entity25 added that many sporting for children activities are expensive and single parents might not be able to afford them			0
the @entity38 had the highest rates of childhood obesity of all states ( 28.5 percent ) and children born in @entity43 are significantly more likely to be overweight ( 27 percent ) than children born overseas ( 20 percent )			2
socio - economic status was the most significant determinant of a child 's weight , with 33 percent of children living in the lowest @entity51 area overweight or obese , compared to only 19 percent in the highest @entity51 areas			2
rates of abuse and neglect were also higher among @entity1 children than they were six years ago , with 8.3 per 1,000 children suffering from abuse or neglect in 2012 compared to 7.4 children per 1,000 in 2008			1
dr @entity60 from the @entity7 cautions that abuse and neglect statistics are hard to interpret , and the increase may reflect higher rates of abuse in the community , but it may also reflect a higher community awareness of abuse and lower tolerance for it			2
' some of it is an increase in people reporting , which is a good thing , ' she told @entity73			0
literacy and numeracy rates have improved across the children , though still remain considerably lower among @entity78 children than non-indigenous children children are more likely to be immunised than five years ago , and rates of immunisation are lowest among children who live in cities and in areas with high socio - economic staturs good news for parents included the fact that fewer children died from injuries in 2012 compared to 2004 - 2006			1

infant mortality among @entity78 children was 6.2 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to 3.6 deaths per 1,000 live births among non-indigenous children			1
dr @entity25 said these results are an improvement on previous years			0
' infant mortality among @entity78 children has really come down a lot			1
if you look at earlier rates you find that the gap is closing , ' she said			0
indigenous children were more than three times more likely to die by injury before the age of 14 , with 17 deaths per 100,000 children compared to 5 deaths per 100,000 in the non-indigenous population			2

this was up from a rate of 42.5 in every 1,000 @entity78 children in 2007 - 2008			1
indigenous children also fared much worse when it came to meeting national minimum standards of numeracy and literacy – 69 percent and 65 percent respectively – compared to 93 percent and 92 percent of non-indigenous children			1
@entity1 children also have a better chance of surviving infancy , with infant mortality rates dropping from five deaths per 1,000 live births in 2006 , to four deaths in 2012			1
boys are more likely to die at birth than girls , with 4.1 deaths per live 1,000 births , compared to 3.4 deaths among female babies			0

rates of immunisation among children have increased slightly across the country , from 92.5 percent in 2008 to 92.8 percent in 2012			0
people living in the highest socio - economic status areas , and in major cities were less likely to vaccinate their children than others , and @entity43 had the lowest rate of immunisation among all the states , with 90 percent of all @entity43 babies vaccinated .			0
