by @entity0 published : 20:39 est , 28 october 2013 updated : 20:39 est , 28 october 2013 not backing down : mr @entity1 could seek court injunctions to prevent publication of classified information @entity1 last night threatened to take legal action against newspapers that leak ‘ damaging ’ details of intelligence operations			1
the prime minister warned the left - wing guardian newspaper , which has printed classified information from renegade spy @entity12 , that it faced court injunctions if it continues to print claims about the activities of the @entity18 listening station			1
the newspaper , he said , was refusing to behave with ‘ social responsibility ’ despite repeated warnings that the revelations are damaging to national security			1
mr @entity1 threatened to impose a d - notice – an official @entity26 instruction not to print specific items – on newspapers which reveal details of highly sensitive intelligence operations			0
while a d - notice is not legally enforceable , mr @entity1 signalled that ministers could also seek court injunctions to prevent publication			0
mr @entity1 acknowledged that @entity35 had let agents of the security services destroy computer hard drives containing some of @entity12 ’s material after being warned that terrorists could access it on their servers			1
under pressure : @entity35 editor @entity44 pictured arriving at the @entity46 inquiry in 2011 , is accused of damaging national security and refusing to behave with ' social responsibility ' by printing the leaks security risk : renegade @entity51 spy @entity12 leaked details of intelligence operations to the left - wing newspaper but he made clear that his patience is wearing thin after the latest batch of revelations – that the @entity51 have bugged the phones of 35 world leaders and that @entity60 intelligence has eavesdropped on @entity62 and @entity63 citizens			1
the prime minister told @entity65 : ‘ we have a free press , it ’s very important the @entity67 feels it is not pre-censored from what it writes			0
the approach we have taken is to try to talk to the @entity67 and explain how damaging some of these things can be , and that is why @entity35 did actually destroy some of the information and discs that they have			1
but they ’ve now gone on and printed further material which is damaging			0
‘ i do n’t want to have to use injunctions or d - notices or the other tougher measures			0
i think it ’s much better to appeal to newspapers ’ sense of social responsibility			1
but if they do n’t demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for @entity88 to stand back and not to act			2
’ a @entity90 source said the government could intervene ‘ if we were aware that they have material that could be published ’			2
that would give ministers broad scope to gag newspapers in the courts since security chiefs are already aware of material stolen by @entity12 which has not yet seen the light of day in the media			2
it emerged yesterday that spy chiefs lost track of terrorists after @entity12 ’s leaks			2
militants stopped using electronic communications after he revealed the extent of monitoring by @entity18 and the @entity51 @entity113			0
in a statement to the @entity115 , mr @entity1 said serious attempts were made to attack @entity60 once or twice a year , and highlighted to @entity65 that 330 people had been convicted of terrorism offences in @entity60 courts since the 9/11 terror attacks			0
‘ i quote these figures just to demonstrate the scale of the ongoing threat we face in our country , ’ mr @entity1 said .			0
