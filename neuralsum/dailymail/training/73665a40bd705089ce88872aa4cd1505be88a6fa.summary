by @entity0 purposeful pregnancy : @entity2 actively tried to keep any mentions of her pregnancy offline to prove a point about invasive internet marketers a sociology professor has taken her latest lesson out of the classroom by actively trying to keep her internet browser from figuring out she was pregnant in order to avoid marketing schemes			1
@entity2 is a sociologist with a focus on science and technology at @entity16 and she actively fought to keep her pregnancy from the internet			1
she avoided buying anything on the internet and called her friends and relatives to tell them the news of her pregnancy rather than announcing it on @entity25 or via email			1
in the call , she told all of her friends and family about the project and urged them to keep all of their upcoming comments on her social media accounts free of any baby mentions			1
one uncle failed to follow the rules , and prompted got un-friended			0
she spoke about the experience at a technology conference in @entity39 on friday , telling how she has ' a very personal perspective of what it takes to avoid being collected , being tracked and being placed into databases '			0
ms @entity2 's experiment was n't motivated by a vendetta against federal privacy infringement , but rather the invasive marketing tactics used by firms who use internet data collection as a way to predict spending patterns			2
' this became especially important in my life about nine months ago because pregnant women , as you may know , are incredibly valuable to digital marketing databases , ' she said at the theorizing the web conference , according to @entity60			0
cash only : she and her husband avoided online shopping , but some purchases could n't be stopped , and in those instances they used cash to buy @entity68 gift cards that were not associated with their names or addresses her ideas about the value of pregnant mothers to marketers is based in facts , as an average non-pregnant person 's data is worth 10 cents to marketers , while the identity and information about a pregnant woman is $ 1.50			1
' this is because we are making decisions for the first time about particular kinds of consumption patterns that are going to dictate our lives for the next number of years , ' ms @entity2 said			0
prenatal items and maternity wear were all purchased in cash , in person , and though she and her husband tried to do that throughout the nearly nine months that the experiment has gone on for , some things were unavoidable			0
for the instances where online was the only option , they purchased @entity68 gift cards in cash and then used the coupon codes to purchase baby - centric items online			1
valuable : internet marketing firms are able to sell data about pregnant women to interested companies for 150 % more than their non-pregnant counterparts as an extra precaution , they had said items shipped to a specially - purchased locker so that it could n't be connected to her real address			2
when her husband went to get upwards of $ 500 in @entity68 gift certificates to purchase their stroller , they ran into some slight legal trouble when he realized that @entity123 laws dictate that @entity124 has to report the ' excessive transactions ' to the authorities since it is a practice associated with shadier dealings			2
another darker twist came when she turned to @entity131 , an untraceable internet browser that has been associated with illegal dealings like that of drug dealers or bitcoin exchanges			0
' those kinds of activities , when you take them in the aggregate ... are exactly the kinds of things that tag you as likely engaging in criminal activity , as opposed to just having a baby , ' she said .			0

@entity2 is a sociology professor at @entity16 and used her pregnancy to make a point about the excessive marketing *geared* towards mothers
she called friends and family to announce the pregnancy rather than writing anything on @entity25 or social media
asked them to do the same , but had to un-friend an uncle who broke the rule because @entity25 is one of the most - closely ' mined ' areas
paid for everything with cash and used @entity68 coupons ( bought with cash ) when online purchases were unavoidable
rented out a shipping locker and opened a new email account
information about normal *people* sells for 10 cents per individual , but marketing companies can charge up to $ 1.50 per pregnant woman
