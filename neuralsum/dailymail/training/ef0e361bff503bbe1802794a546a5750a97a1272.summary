father - of - two @entity0 , 33 , of @entity1 , was facing a second - degree attempted murder charge after shooting @entity10 , then 14 , in the head , claiming he thought the teenager was going to rob him			1
however , @entity13 will no longer charge mr @entity0 as the teenager has been arrested connection with burglaries in the same neighbourhood			1
the incident last july left the now 15 - year - old @entity10 in critical condition and doctors feared he would not survive			2
mr @entity0 claimed he had found @entity10 by his care in the gated driveway and when the teenager made a quick movement ' as if to reach for something , ' so he shot him out of concern for his own safety , according to an arrest warrant			1
@entity10 was shot from 30 feet away , according to evidence recovered at the scene			2
at the time , @entity10 ’s family members admitted that he had been involved in petty crimes , but that he would never touch a weapon			2
' he would steal - he was a professional thief , sure , ' @entity10 's 23 - year - old brother , @entity34 , told the @entity35 at the time			2
' but he would never pick up a gun , not in a million years			0
he was too scared to aim a gun at the grass , let alone aim it at a person			0
before he 'll ever pick up a gun , he 'll be your friend first			0
' ' he 's still a little boy , ' the brother added			0
' who pulls a trigger on a 14 - year - old ? what if it was your little brother or your sister ? how would you feel ? ' @entity52 , the brother of injured teen @entity10 , said his brother has been involved in petty crimes but would never been violent however , although @entity10 was unarmed when he was shot by mr @entity0 , he was recently linked to a crime in 2012 when he is accused of entering a house where he stole a gun , threatened the homeowner and fled with the weapon			1
earlier this month @entity10 was arrested after a homeowner in the @entity62 neighbourhood found him in his house , after which another resident in the area found that his cctv system had captured @entity10 attempting to break into his home			1
‘ following @entity10 's most recent burglary arrests , any case that this office had against @entity0 was irreversibly damaged , ’ @entity1 district attorney @entity69 said in statement to @entity35 ‘ i am ethically obligated not to charge an individual against whom i do not possess evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed a crime			1
‘ such evidence does not exist in this case			0
’ the teen was unarmed and standing near @entity0 's vehicle , which was parked in the gated driveway in front of @entity0 's house ( pictured ) on @entity86 , when he was shot the teen had allegedly climbed over the gate to @entity0 's driveway , pictured here it also appears that @entity10 may have exaggerate his medical condition , as officials had been led to believe that he was still unable to walk without assistance			1
the recent burglary arrests indicate otherwise			0

‘ @entity0 never wanted to be in a position to shoot anyone , ’ mr @entity0 ’s attorney @entity96 told @entity35 ‘ he never wanted to be in the position where he had to defend his family , but he did that , and now he 's had to live through this ordeal			0
