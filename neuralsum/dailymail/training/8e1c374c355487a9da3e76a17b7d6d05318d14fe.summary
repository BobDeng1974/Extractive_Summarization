by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor it 's that awkward moment when you are forced to have a meeting with someone who you tried to force out of a job			1
@entity7 today grimaced his way through his first formal talks with @entity10 after failing to block his appointment as @entity13 president			1
the two men posed for a photograph where mr @entity10 did not even look at the camera , and the pair were later pictured trying - and failing - to high - five each other , which was quickly mocked online			1
mr @entity7 was so bitterly opposed to mr @entity10 taking the top @entity23 job that he forced an unprecedented vote on it			1
only @entity34 joined mr @entity7 in voting against his appointment			2
now , the prime minister has been forced to pretend the whole thing never happened , and insist he can still work with the former @entity39 premier			0
their face - to - face encounter in @entity23 today comes after mr @entity7 made a difficult phone call to congratulate mr @entity43 in his success in taking the job he tried to block			1
' the prime minister congratulated mr @entity10 on running a successful campaign and securing the @entity50 nomination , ' @entity46 said in a statement last month issued through gritted teeth			2
mr @entity10 , a fixture in @entity55 politics for decades and architect of the eurozone , has insisted that descriptions of him as an arch - federalist are overblown			1
@entity46 played down the significance of the photographs today , insisting mr @entity10 greets lots of people with a high - five			1
mr @entity7 's officials spokesman said : ' as i understand it , it is how mr @entity10 greets quite a lot of people			1
' they know each other quite well , of course , because they sat around the @entity55 table when he was prime minister of @entity39			0
' however , the display of mock playfulness became the subject of internet parodies and ridicule online			0
a parody account named after mr @entity10 posted this message , claiming he tried to ' slap ' mr @entity7 another @entity83 account likened the encounter to a handshake from @entity86 he has also stressed he is not in principle opposed to the @entity88 repatriating some powers from @entity23 - a key demand of mr @entity7 in the run - up to an in / out referendum mooted for 2017			1
however , he has said the free movement of labour within the union is not up for grabs , and risked the wrath of @entity98 by lavishing praise on one of their hate figures - former commission head @entity103			0
mr @entity7 's surprise decision to put @entity105 forward to represent @entity88 has been branded a ' shambles ' after the peer had to sell shares in a lobbying firm to avoid criticism over conflicts of interest			2
he acted to head off concerns over his significant holding in Â£ 140 million global public affairs company @entity115 , which operates in @entity23			2
@entity46 released this picture of the pair , with mr @entity43 looking away from the camera and mr @entity7 grinning awkwardly an official picture issued by the @entity55 of the face - to - face talks suggested the meeting was not particularly cordial , with mr @entity7 sitting with his arms folded @entity124 had warned that they would be looking closely at the interest in deciding whether to confirm his appointment			1
president of the @entity129 @entity128 also suggested that he could be rejected for being too eurosceptic - although he later backtracked and insisted he would be treated fairly at confirmation hearings			2
number 10 pointed out that the @entity129 has the opportunity to approve or reject a new commission ' as a whole , as a slate , not as individuals '			0
lord @entity105 told journalists in @entity23 that he would not view himself as a @entity98			0
' i 'm not a great one for looking for names or badges or boxes , ' he said			0
lord @entity105 previously replied ' non , non , non ' when asked if he wanted the @entity55 job - but said last night : ' i am not a reluctant conscript			0
it is true that i loved my time at the @entity147 , which is a fantastic institution , full of wonderful people			0
' the fact is , having thought about the importance of this job , the pivotal role that it will play , the crucial time in the history of the @entity55 and also of @entity88 , it is a fantastic opportunity to be involved and i would be mad not to do it			0
' during talks last night , @entity158 's chancellor @entity157 appeared to cower as mr @entity7 was talking to @entity161 's prime minister @entity160 @entity55 leaders last night put off decisions on commissioners and portfolios for a few weeks , with an impasse between @entity158 and @entity167 being blamed			0
each of the 28 member states nominates someone to serve in a post for a four - year term , with @entity39 's spot already taken up by mr @entity10			1
@entity88 's current commissioner , @entity174 , has a senior role as @entity176 , which means that brief will go elsewhere this time round			0
the summit also failed to agree a president of the @entity50 to succeed @entity182 - a position for which @entity185 pm @entity184 , wife of @entity187 's son @entity186 , is thought to be in the running .			2

first meeting between the two men since @entity7 tried to block his job
@entity10 became @entity13 president despite row
@entity7 lobbied hard against it , but now says they can work together
at @entity23 summit , they posed for awkward photo and high - five
