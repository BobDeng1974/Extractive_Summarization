a staggering 221 new species were discovered in 2014 by one @entity2 institution alone , including a tiny elephant shrew with a distinctive ' trunk '			0
the list of new species include 110 ants , 16 beetles , three spiders , 28 fish and 24 sea slugs			1
it was compiled using 64 scientific papers published by the @entity14			2
@entity15 to meet you : a total of 221 new species were discovered in 2014 , including a tiny elephant shrew			0
the new species of round - eared sengi , was found in the remote deserts of @entity23 , in south western @entity24			1
it is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis and was called @entity27 the animals were discovered in remote caves , at the bottom of the sea , in deserts and even in the heavily populated state of @entity34			1
‘ biodiversity scientists estimate that we have discovered less than 10 per cent of species on the planet , ’ dr @entity35 , the @entity14 ’s chief of science and @entity37 said			1
the new species include 110 ants , 16 beetles , three spiders , 28 fish , 24 sea slugs , two marine worms , nine barnacles , two octocorals , 25 plants and one mammal			1
pictured is a poison - loving sea slug entomologists found and described 110 new species of ants on the biodiversity hotspot of @entity58			1
one species of note was the @entity61 , or the ‘ hero ant , ’ ( pictured ) which lives in non-porous clay , and is thought to build a striking , funnel - like nest to promote oxygen exchange and protect its colony from suffocation the @entity70 round - eared sengi , or @entity27 , was found in a remote part of the @entity72 in south western @entity24			1
it is the smallest of all elephant shrews or sengis			0
the animal is the third new species of sengi to be discovered in a decade			0
it has rust - coloured fur , a large , hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment			0
genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives			0
sengis are restricted to @entity24 and despite their small size , are more closely related to elephants , manatees ( known as sea cows ) and aardvarks than they are to true shrews			2
‘ @entity14 scientists tirelessly explore the unexplored regions of @entity99 - not only to discover new species , but also to uncover the importance of these species to the health of our natural systems			1
‘ our findings help to sustain the future of life for our children and grandchildren			0
even in our own backyards new discoveries abound			0
’ among the discoveries was a new species of round - eared sengi , or elephant - shrew , which was found in the remote deserts of @entity23 , in south western @entity24			1
it is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis and was called @entity27			0
experts now know that the creatures are restricted to @entity24 and despite their small size , are more closely related to elephants , manatees - known as sea cows - and aardvarks than they are to true shrews			1
entomologists from the @entity126 found and described 110 new species of ants on the biodiversity hot spot of @entity58			1

catch of the day : a gigantic deep water worm eel , called @entity140 is the largest of its kind found off the @entity143 measuring nearly 50 inches ( 127cm ) from head to tail - almost twice as long and three times heavier than any known worm eel the tropical forests and reef - filled waters of @entity149 have yielded three newly discovered ray spiders , which are each about the size of a single grain of sand			2
this image shows the web of one of the tony creatures it also exhibits a defensive behaviour known as ‘ cliff - jumping ’			0
this is when a lone hero ant breaks from the colony and sacrifices itself to tackle an intruding foreign ant approaching the nest entrance by grabbing it and throwing it – and itself – dramatically over the lip of the nest , meaning the insects tumble to their death			0
also among the finds are 65 new species of marine creatures , including a type of 23 - million year old megamouth shark identified by its fossilised teeth			2
a total of 20 new species of gobies , one cardinalfish , one toadfish , two grenadiers , one yellow damselfish , one pipefish , 24 colourful nudibranchs , two octocoral , nine new barnacles , two marine worms , and a ghost shark from @entity192 were also found in 2014			1

it is related to snake eels and probably lurks at depths close to 1,000 feet ( 305 metres ) beneath the ocean ’s surface			0

two were discovered on dormant @entity143 volcanoes while a third was discovered in the forested hills of @entity231 .			0

they were found by the @entity14 in @entity246
the mammal , a small round - eared sengi , was found in @entity23
' @entity251 ' of @entity58 builds a clay nest to promote oxygen exchange
*individuals* also sacrifice themselves for the good of their colony
