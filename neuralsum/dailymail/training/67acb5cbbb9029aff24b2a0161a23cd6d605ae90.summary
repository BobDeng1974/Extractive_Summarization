by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 12:05 est , 15 february 2013 @entity1 has promised a software update for their latest mobile operating system after hackers published a video showing how to unlock any @entity6 running it			1
the @entity8 video and an accompanying explanation details a relatively simple combination of button presses which can quickly bypass the phone 's password screen			1
once entered , it opens the main phone screen where any thief or snoop would be able to make calls , read and send messages , edit contacts , and go through stored data like photos and apps			1
' @entity1 takes user security very seriously			2
we are aware of this issue , and will deliver a fix in a future software update , ' she said			0
it is the latest embarrassment for the @entity49 tech company after another recent bug in the same operating system , @entity30 6.1 , was found to overload corporate email servers			2
business users trying to sync their contacts , mail and other content found themselves kicked off their company 's @entity58 servers , and @entity1 is yet to publish a fix for the problem			1
prior to that , a third bug in the .1 update to @entity64 was found to cause problems with 3g network performance on the @entity68			2
that was quickly fixed with a 6.1.1 update released exclusively to users of the @entity68			0
relatively simple : all a malicious user has to do is enter a series of button presses and the phones boot into their main screen			1
it is the third major bug found so far in @entity1 's latest mobile operating system @entity81 's privacy practices are drawing heat after an @entity84 software developer said the company was providing him with personal information , including email addresses , of everyone who purchased his mobile app. the information that @entity81 shared , which included customers ' full names , email and some postal code information , was not the result of a glitch with its software			1
rather it appears to be in accordance with @entity81 's existing policies for its app store and its @entity103 payment service			0
privacy advocates believe @entity81 has not been clear in informing consumers about the practice			0
@entity81 has ' buried ' the notice about how it shares users ' personal information in fine print rather than obtain the express consent of users , said @entity113 , executive director of the @entity114			0
' meaningful consent is about people understanding what they 're getting into			0
it 's about not tricking them , ' he said			0
' in a situation like this , where people just do n't know what information is being transferred or who it 's going to or for what purpose , it seems ridiculous to say that @entity81 has consent			0
' the video detailing the @entity6 passcode hack was published onto @entity8 by videosdebarraquito at the end of january and has already been viewed nearly 300,000 times			0
it tells how a rapid combination of emergency call , keypad , power button and cancel button taps will bypass the phone 's security , leaving it accessible to anyone			1
in text accompanying the video , the user describes it as an ' [ e ] asy trick that allows bypass an @entity6 's passcode and get full access ( see and edit ) to contacts list , list of recent calls , favorite contacts , and even make a call to any phone number on the hacked device and erase the log			1
' the text details the precise combination of actions to carry out to exploit the vulnerability			2
the user adds that you can use it ' [ f ] or prank your friends			0
for a magic show ... use it as you want , at your own risk , but ... please ... do not use this trick to do evil ! ! ! ' it is not the first time @entity1 's devices have been found to be vulnerable to such a trick			1
a similar bug allowed the same kind of access in gadgets running @entity64 4.1 , @entity178 reported			2
it took a month for @entity1 to release the .2 update to that operating system which removed the vulnerability .			1

combination of button presses bypasses lock screen
*breach* enables hackers to access all of the phone 's data
it is the third major bug found in @entity197
similar to vulnerability in @entity200 , which took a month for @entity1 to fix
