a family has vowed to buy only @entity2 - made goods - but say they are already struggling to find enough non-foreign products			1
when @entity6 and @entity7 set out to avoid anything that was not produced by a @entity2 firm , they had no idea how difficult the challenge would prove			1

despite the challenges , the couple , as well as their two - year - old son @entity19 , are still eating nothing but @entity2 food			2
mr @entity47 admitted that the family had struggled most with fully adopting the @entity2 - only ' mindset '			1
he said : ' we 've realised there are things we just wo n't get because they 're not in season here - like strawberries			0
' it 's about coming up with other solutions and trying new things , which is a really exciting part of the challenge we have set ourselves			0
' hurdles : the challenge , beginning on january 1 , has led to difficulties such as the unavailability of @entity2 - made batteries			2
they soon plan to grow their own vegetables mrs @entity7 , a teacher , initially thought up the idea before her husband decided to implement the rule to all materials - from batteries to dishwasher powder			1
describing the decision , which the family implemented on @entity75 , mr @entity47 said : ' @entity7 suggested avoiding some companies because of tax issues , but i wondered if it was possible to live a normal family life on only @entity2 goods			1

' we are finding that this country produces affordable clothing , electronics and foods			0
but it can take a week to find a @entity2 made dishwasher tablet because of the research we have to put in to each item			1
' more than 40 days in , the @entity117 are starting to fear the worst about items they can not find in the @entity2 , such as pepper , and plan to grow their own vegetables			1
