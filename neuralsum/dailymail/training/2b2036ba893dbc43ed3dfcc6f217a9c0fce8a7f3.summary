by @entity0 a @entity2 woman has such severe problems with the blood supply to her fingers that her hands turn purple , and her fingers white , when they are exposed to the cold			1
the 45 - year - old , who has not been named , has severe @entity12 ’s phenomenon			1
the condition occurs when the blood vessels in the hands and fingers go into a temporary spasm blocking the flow of blood			1
when the patient ’s hands warm up again , and blood returns to the fingers , they can become very painful			1
patients sometimes also experience pins and needles in the affected parts of their body			2
the condition is not a serious threat to a person ’s health but it can be difficult to live with if it means the fingers become stiff and numb every time they get cold			1
the severe case of the @entity2 patient was reported in @entity48			2
dr @entity49 , senior lecturer in rheumatology at the @entity51 , told @entity52 : ‘ this is a very severe case			0
@entity54 ’s is a very common disorder but most patients will not have it so severely			0

’ she explained that it can be problematic when people are trying to take food from a cold fridge or if they are trying to find things in a bag when they are outside on a cold day			0
she told @entity52 that the @entity2 patient was probably developing systemic sclerosis – a relatively rare autoimmune disorder associated with abnormalities in the capillaries			0
dr @entity81 said : ‘ it is very strongly associated with @entity12 ’s so if someone presents with new @entity12 ’s this needs to be considered			2
‘ it can affect the gut , the lungs , kidneys and the heart			0
it ’s important to recognise it might be happening so we can prevent damage to internal organs through careful management			0
’ systemic sclerosis causes hard , thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with the internal organs and blood vessels			1
it is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own tissues , including the connective tissue under the skin and surrounding the organs and blood vessels			1
it causes hardening of the skin but can also cause problems with the gut , such as heartburn , and joint stiffness , hair loss , weight loss and fatigue			0
if it also affects the heart , lungs or kidneys it can cause shortness of breath and high blood pressure			0
@entity123 , ceo of the @entity54 told @entity52 : ‘ @entity124 is a rare condition , in the @entity126 it 's estimated that around 6,000 suffer from scleroderma in one of its forms			2
‘ there is no cure but improved knowledge over the last few years means it can now be better managed			0

@entity12 's phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body - usually the fingers and toes			1
it occurs because the blood vessels go into a temporary spasm blocking the flow of blood			1
this causes the affected area to go white and then blue and red as the blood returns			1
it is usually triggered by cold temperatures , anxiety or stress			2
sufferers can also experience pain , numbness and pins and needles			2
it is not a serious threat to health but can be annoying to live with			0
the only way to manage the condition is to avoid the cold , or to wear gloves			0
in most cases , @entity12 's is primary - it develops by itself			1
however , sometimes it is a secondary condition - it develops in association with another health condition			2
the condition is usually mild and it is thought to affect about 10 million people in the @entity126			0
it is three times more common in women than in men .			0
