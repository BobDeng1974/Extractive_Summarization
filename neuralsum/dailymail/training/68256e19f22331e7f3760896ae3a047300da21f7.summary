by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ when @entity3 leads his team out for the first time at @entity6 against @entity7 on tuesday evening , we should receive a clear indication of the players that will form a central part of the @entity13 's plans at @entity6 in the opening weeks of the season			1
with the likes of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 already cut adrift , @entity15 identifies five players hoping to seal a place in the starting line - up for the visit of @entity24 when the @entity25 kicks off this weekend			0
his opportunities will now come through the middle and nobody should underestimate how important that is for the @entity44 forward			0
there was credence to the reports that @entity35 was considering a move towards the end of last season			0
he has always been a little sensitive to the microscope being placed over his goalscoring return when defensive priorities have been emphasised so much by previous managers @entity56 and sir @entity57			0
@entity35 recorded a good return of 11 last season but only scored three after the turn of the year			0
if he is to flourish centrally , @entity26 will need to count on @entity35 to hit 15 this season			0
with @entity62 still returning to peak condition after his @entity65 exertions and doubts surrounding the future of @entity68 , an eye - catching performance on tuesday should see @entity35 seal his place in the starting line - up on saturday			0
point to prove : @entity35 ( left ) must show he can fit into a side with @entity62 and @entity74 @entity75 after a truly disappointing 18 months , @entity75 's renaissance under @entity26 has been nothing short of remarkable			1
ineffectual and frustrating under @entity78 , @entity75 has been reenergised in the left wing - back position and looks likely to now be retained by the @entity13			1
on the evidence of this summer , most @entity30 followers will agree with that decision and that would have been unthinkable at the end of last season			1
nonetheless , it is still expected that @entity87 will be the first - choice option in the position but with @entity26 making clear his doubts over the 19 - year - old 's fitness just a couple of weeks ago , @entity75 could yet have the chance to start when the @entity25 returns this weekend			2
@entity93 : @entity75 ( left ) has enjoyed an impressive pre-season after struggling under @entity56 @entity95 with @entity97 suffering a serious injury in pre-season , an opportunity has emerged in the midfield positions for @entity95 , who was outstanding in pre-season match against @entity102			1
finally , after a debilitating bowel disorder that - as he admitted - left him one make - or - break procedure away from retirement , @entity95 appears to be back to his best			0
still only 30 , a fit and dynamic @entity95 has much to offer to @entity30 and his courage has only increased his popularity among the @entity6 support			1
the @entity109 only made 12 starts last season and @entity56 , it is understood , would have been open to the idea of selling him if @entity30 received the right offer this summer			2
that would now appear unlikely under @entity26 , with @entity117 the only arrival in central midfield and @entity95 demonstrating his credentials so clearly in the @entity121			0
@entity122 wants reinforcements back in favour : @entity95 could have a key role to play in the @entity30 midfield this season @entity127 the scapegoat for many of @entity30 's ills last season , @entity127 certainly appears more relaxed and content under the leadership of @entity26			1
the 25 - year - old captained @entity30 in the @entity134 against @entity135 and he is determined to make it work at @entity6			1
at varying points , @entity57 , @entity56 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 have all seen things they admire in this player and @entity26 , also , sees a place for @entity127 in his squad			2
he will know that he must add more goals to his game and that he must bring greater control to the @entity30 midfield			2
last season , he came up a little short - but then again , who did n't in a red shirt ? with @entity97 injured - and @entity19 and @entity17 on their way out - @entity127 must shine this season			2
getting stuck in : @entity127 's career stalled last season and he must prove he can fulfil his potential @entity158 the @entity160 playmaker has performed only in fits and starts in his two seasons at @entity6 , although he would argue that he has been forced out of his favoured position behind the forwards and onto the left - wing all too often			1
failed to score in 30 appearances under @entity56 last season but @entity26 appears to have seen something and @entity158 will act as back - up behind @entity170 and the emerging @entity171 in the hole this season			0
if @entity170 is fit , he will start on saturday but a classy performance from @entity158 at @entity6 on tuesday may cause @entity26 a headache ahead of his first @entity25 game this weekend			1
last chance ? @entity158 has yet to perform at his best after two years at @entity6			0

@entity30 play @entity7 in their final pre-season *friendlyon* tuesday
@entity3 leads his side at @entity6 for the first time
@entity127 and @entity75 just two players with a point to prove
