a major breakthrough in testing for pre-eclampsia — a condition which costs the lives of 1,000 unborn babies in @entity5 every year — could save many families from suffering this huge loss			1
pre-eclampsia , where a defect with the placenta causes blood pressure to soar , is still impossible to cure			1
but more reliable testing means more babies should survive , and fewer women given distressing and dangerous precautionary treatment — such as very early delivery — after inaccurate test results			2
risky death : @entity19 was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia			1
her daughter @entity21 weighed just 1lb 1oz and while @entity19 ’s condition improved , @entity21 remained in intensive care for four months @entity19 knows all too well how the condition can strike — 25 weeks into her first pregnancy , everything seemed fine			1
yes , the previous week her blood pressure had been slightly raised and her midwife suggested a further check , but she had no idea how much danger she and her baby were in			1
in fact , that second check probably saved both their lives			2
she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia			2
this can lead to dangerously high blood pressure in the mother , increasing her risk of stroke , seizures , heart failure and organ failure , which threaten the lives of mother and baby			1
‘ i had n’t had any of the common symptoms , such as swelling around the feet and ankles , and headaches , ’ recalls @entity19 , 36 , an ambulance technician from @entity49			1
the only possible signs were a little dizziness and rib pain			0
but at the second check , her blood pressure reading was even higher than before , and she was sent straight to hospital			1
there , it continued rising and three days later , the doctors ’ only option was to deliver her daughter by @entity64 , four months early			0
this is the only way to stop pre-eclampsia , but doctors could not be sure if mother and child would make it			0
thousands of babies are delivered early to prevent the condition worsening and around 1,000 die because of pre-eclampsia every year @entity19 ’s daughter @entity21 weighed just 1lb 1oz and while @entity19 ’s condition improved , @entity21 remained in intensive care for four months			1
now aged three , she is still prone to chest infections , coughs and colds			0
one in ten women develops pre-eclampsia during their first pregnancy			2
for one in 100 , such as @entity19 , it is a serious condition			2
when the placenta stops working properly , the body releases toxic substances to the lining of blood vessels			0
as a result , the blood vessel lining — the endothelium — becomes inflamed , which damages organs and causes them to fail			0
signs of pre-eclampsia include high blood pressure , headaches , swelling and visual disturbances			1
it can also restrict the baby ’s growth as the placenta supplies nutrients and oxygen from the mother ’s blood			0
sometimes there are no symptoms			0
thousands of babies are delivered early to prevent the condition worsening and around 1,000 die because of pre-eclampsia every year , either because the failing placenta means their life - support is cut off or they are delivered too early to survive			1
experts still do n’t understand why this condition occurs , although risk factors include pre-existing high blood pressure , @entity121 , kidney disease , diabetes , a twin pregnancy , first pregnancy , increased age , being overweight and previous pre-eclampsia			1
the test correctly identified 96 per cent of women with pre-eclampsia , sharply up from the 58 to 76 per cent detected with current methods ‘ however , these are all associations and we still do n’t know exactly why the placenta stops working properly , and why only some women develop it , ’ says dr @entity131 , a professor of obstetric medicine at @entity133 , @entity134 , and chair of trustees for charity action on @entity138			0
women identified as being at high risk are put on low - dose aspirin from 12 weeks of pregnancy			1
but doctors have no clear way of telling which women can safely be monitored and which will get swiftly worse , leading to thousands of early deliveries			0
but a new blood test , developed by @entity5 doctors and being introduced in some hospitals , could revolutionise treatment and save lives by identifying the worst cases			1
professor @entity162 , a consultant obstetrician at @entity163 ’s and @entity133 , who did the research into the test , says it will ‘ radically change how we manage these women ’			0
the @entity167 test , which gives results in 15 minutes , measures levels of a protein known as placental growth factor ( @entity172 ) , which increases during pregnancy			0
a one - year study with 625 women with suspected pre-eclampsia found that those with a very low @entity172 level had severe pre-eclampsia , while those with high levels were very unlikely to have a severe form even if they had symptoms , and could safely carry their baby until full term			2
the test correctly identified 96 per cent of women with the condition , sharply up from the 58 to 76 per cent detected with current methods			0
for women like @entity19 , it could make all the difference when considering having a second baby			2
