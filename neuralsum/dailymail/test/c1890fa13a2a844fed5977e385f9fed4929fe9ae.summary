@entity0 have upset supporters after dumping pictures of sir @entity4 ’s title - chasing team in a skip outside @entity6			1
framed squad photographs of sir @entity4 alongside the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 have been found discarded alongside grass cuttings , cardboard boxes and bin bags			1
the pictures were removed from corporate boxes inside the stadium and have been replaced by more recent images			0
framed photographs of sir @entity4 's title - chasing side were found thrown in a skip outside the stadium the skip was situated outside @entity6 where fans were able to spot the disgraceful move by the club @entity29 , of @entity30 , told the @entity31 : ‘ they could have auctioned them for charity , but just to put these things in the bin is awful			1
now fans are talking about going and helping themselves			0
‘ they are pictures of club legends			2
i do n’t think the club want people to be reminded of a time when they were doing well because they are doing so badly at the moment			0
’ @entity4 ’s team finished fourth in 2002 and qualified for the @entity43 , where they memorably made it to the second group phase after a last - gasp victory in @entity48			2
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 are some of the legends who are included in the photos sir @entity4 , who passed away in 2009 , is still fondly remembered and has a statue outside of the stadium in 2003 they topped the table for a period before finishing third , a return which has not been bettered in the years since			1
meanwhile , a spokesperson for the club said the images were ‘ old and not being used anymore ’			0
but the ‘ @entity65 ’ group , who are behind sunday ’s planned boycott of @entity0 ’s home match with @entity64 , tweeted : ‘ our proud history in the skip outside @entity68 along with ambition and hope ’			0
@entity0 fan @entity71 tweeted : ' as a metaphor for the club this could not be more apt. @entity74			2
there is nothing left to support at @entity30 under this regime '			0
former club @entity78 ( left ) flourished under sir @entity4 and was instrumental in qualifying for @entity81 @entity11 ( right ) , who died in 2011 , was another player who loved playing for his former manager @entity12 ( right ) was a key figure in @entity0 's title challenge and is also seen as a club legend @entity0 , who lost to @entity87 on monday , have never been the same since sir @entity4 left the club @entity89 worked under @entity4 during his time in charge and should no doubt be upset by this move			1
