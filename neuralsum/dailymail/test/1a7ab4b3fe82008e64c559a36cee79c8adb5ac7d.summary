@entity0 will have no supporters present at saturday 's championship game against @entity3 at @entity4 after the @entity6 club backed their fans in handing back their allocation of 500 tickets			1
both clubs have a history of fan trouble but @entity3 have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club , council or police , when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans			1
and now @entity0 have thrown their support behind a fan - run campaign to boycott the trip to @entity4 by handing back their tickets ' as a matter of principle '			2
@entity0 will have no supporters present at saturday 's @entity32 game against @entity3 the club , including ceo @entity34 ( far left ) have thrown their backing behind a fans ' boycott of the game @entity0 welcomed 2,200 @entity3 fans to the @entity40 in the reverse fixture back in november 's game , which ended a 3 - 1 win for the home side , and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate			1
@entity46 have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to @entity52 before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions			1
supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut - out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that @entity0 will not take up any of their seats at @entity4			2
@entity4 will be without any away fans on saturday for the 3pm kick - off after @entity0 sent back the tickets the reverse fixture earlier in the season at the @entity40 saw @entity3 fans offered 2,200 tickets ' our preference was for @entity0 fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 @entity3 supporters for the corresponding fixture this season , and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted , ' @entity0 ceo @entity34 said in a statement			1
' with the intelligence and information available however , we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk			0
' as stated by our @entity89 , we also believe that @entity90 could manage the event without issue or restrictions , if they chose to do so			0
' @entity34 said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with ' respect and freedom ' as @entity3 were @entity3 fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the @entity99 on saturday afternoon @entity90 were criticised by @entity101 manager @entity100 earlier this year for their treatment of his club 's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets			1
@entity90 are yet to comment on @entity0 's statement			0
@entity3 have also rejected @entity0 's request to hold a ' beam back ' at the @entity40 , with the 3pm kick - off being shown at the away side 's ground in @entity6 , a decision that @entity113 says has left his club frustrated			1
' for the game on saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at @entity40 , ' he added			0
@entity125 of @entity3 celebrates after scoring against @entity126 on @entity127 @entity128 of @entity0 in action against @entity130 at the @entity40 on monday ' doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match , albeit to a lesser degree than preferred			2
' @entity135 chairman @entity134 said , ' @entity135 fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the @entity137 for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups			0
' the " bad old days " of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of " fans " have thankfully been left far behind us now			0
this is now reflected in the respectful treatment received from the majority of clubs we visit			0
let â€™s hope that this message hits home loud and clear to @entity3			0

@entity0 have *joined* their fans in *protest* against @entity3 tickets
the two sides face each other in the @entity32 on saturday at 3pm
