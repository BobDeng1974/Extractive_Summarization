by @entity0 published : 12:08 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 12:11 est , 31 january 2014 two @entity3 monkeys , named @entity4 and @entity5 , have become the first genetically - modified primates to be born using a powerful ‘ cut and paste ’ dna technique			2
scientists claim the technology could usher in a new era in genetic medicine and help combat diseases such as @entity14 's and @entity15 's			1
dubbed @entity16 , the technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could create more realistic research models of human disease			1
two @entity3 monkeys , named @entity4 and @entity5 , have become the first genetically - modified primates to be born using a powerful ' cut and paste ' dna technique in this case , it was used to manipulate two genes in fertilised monkey eggs before they were transferred to surrogate mothers			2
writing in the journal , @entity28 , the team from @entity29 reported the successful delivery of twin female long - tailed macaques using the technique			0
five surrogate mothers miscarried and four more pregnancies are ongoing			0
scientists have previously used the new genome - editing technology to delete , insert , and modify dna in human cells grown in petri dishes			2
the ladder - rung patterns in an image of a dna gel show that genome editing successfully modified a gene in two macaque infants ( shown in the central columns ) , but not in an untreated animal ( right column ) @entity54 - @entity53 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code unlike other gene - silencing tools , the @entity54 - @entity53 system targets the genome ’s source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level			1
the dna cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally , for instance after chronic sun exposure			0
but unlike uv rays that can result in genetic alterations , the @entity54 - @entity53 system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome			1
when cellular machinery repairs the dna break , it removes a small snip of @entity39			0
in this way , researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome			0
but the new study shows for the first time that @entity54 - @entity53 can create healthy primates with their dna modified at specific targeted genes			1
@entity85 , who led the @entity3 team , said that @entity54 - @entity53 could be used to create monkeys that carry genetic faults that lead to diseases in humans for animal testing			1
the technology can also be used to grow human organs in the lab , and used to test drugs , or to monitor how serious diseases can affect the body			0
@entity99 changes in @entity39 are also being investigated as a way to make people resistant to @entity102			0
scientists believe @entity54 - @entity53 has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of currently available gene - silencing techniques			1
‘ we can now use this technology on a genome - wide scale , giving us the ability to interrogate any gene we want , ’ said @entity107 , a member of the @entity108 and assistant professor at @entity110			0

the @entity54 - @entity53 procedure has been welcomed by geneticists in labs around the world because of its huge potential			1
but this recent breakthrough has created opposition by some groups opposed to animal testing			0
' our study shows that the @entity54 / @entity53 system enables simultaneous disruption of two target genes in one step without producing off - target mutations , said study author @entity85 of @entity29			2
' considering that many human diseases are caused by genetic abnormalities , targeted genetic modification in monkeys is invaluable for the generation of human disease models			2

@entity54 - @entity53 technique can be used to create monkeys with genetic faults
scientists say they serve accurate research models for human disease
they hope it will help combat diseases such as @entity14 's and @entity15 's
