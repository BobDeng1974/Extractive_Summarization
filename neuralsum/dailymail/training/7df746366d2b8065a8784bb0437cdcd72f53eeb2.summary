by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:58 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:58 est , 22 december 2013 the extent to which junk mail and nuisance phone calls had taken over my life became clear during one hellish day when i felt as though i was under siege in my own home			1
on this day , my letterbox seemed to open and snap shut every 15 minutes with some leaflet or other offering a service i did n’t need			2
when the junk mail was n’t disturbing the peace , my mobile and landline were ringing with calls claiming i was due a small fortune in @entity20 and accident compensation or from call centres asking me to take part in endless surveys			1
deck the hall with junk : claudia with her stacks of unwanted mail it all added up to an incredibly stressful day when i was unable to get any work done			1
certainly it ’s a problem that has become part and parcel of modern life , but what made it all the more frustrating was that i take every step i can to ensure i ’m not targeted			2
i refuse to join mailing lists , i untick boxes asking if i ’d like to be sent special offers , my phone number is ex-directory and i ’m registered with the @entity44 ( telephone preference service )			1
clearly , though , these were n’t working			2
so , with a mixture of sheer frustration and morbid curiosity , i decided on that day in november last year to keep a running total of all my junk mail and nuisance calls for 12 months			1
my experiment came to an end at the beginning of this month and the outcome is staggering			2
over the past year i have experienced 4,481 unwelcome intrusions into my life in the form of unsolicited post , spam emails , phone calls and texts			1
of all these intrusions , it ’s the junk mail that i find the most infuriating			1
deluge : 17.5billion pieces of junk mail are distributed in @entity68 every year on a bad day , leaflets start dropping through my letterbox as early as 6am and can continue until as late as 10pm			1
sometimes , i ’ll come home after a day out to find a dozen pieces of paper strewn across my floor			2
every year around 17.5 billion pieces of junk mail , addressed and unaddressed , are distributed across the country			1
the average householder receives 453 of them			2
on tuesday , the @entity81 ran the story of @entity83 , 44 , a graphic designer from @entity84 , @entity85 , who collected 1,027 pieces of junk mail in a year			1
well , guess what ? i can do better than that			2
i received nearly treble the national average			2
this year , 1,147 items of junk were delivered to me			1
my house is in a part of @entity95 known for its young families and high - earning professionals			1
and even though i do n’t slot into either category , it means that if i look out of my window i rarely have to wait more than a few minutes before i see a leaflet distributor			2
my tally included 91 cards from taxi firms , 76 freesheets and newspapers and 42 envelopes and bags from charities			0
there were also 159 takeaway menus - a third from @entity113 and @entity114 , who rarely went a week without reminding me of their latest offers			1
endless : spam email traffic is never - ending , and practically impossible to stem as the value of properties in my area has risen by 25 per cent in the past year , estate agents are keen to make their presence known			1
there have been 123 communications , including 30 addressed to me by name from agents who , presumably , had identified me on the electoral roll			0
i also received 309 flyers from companies offering every kind of service you can imagine from cleaning and gardening to baby - sitting and dog walking			1
religious groups including the @entity136 and @entity137 left their calling cards , as did one gentleman calling himself ‘ mr @entity141 the @entity140 ’ who , for a small fee , would place lifelong curses on my enemies			0
on more than one occasion i wondered how much he ’d charge for performing a little voodoo on @entity113 or @entity150 estate agents			0
my local authority , @entity152 , has failed to see the irony of leafleting me on 24 occasions about my duty to recycle and dispose of my mail responsibly			1
of the half a million tonnes of junk mail generated in @entity68 every year , around a fifth ends up going to landfill sites at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £ 50 million			1
then there is the damage to the environment			0
it takes 17 trees to produce each tonne of junk mail			1
in the past year , there were only eight blissful days out of 365 when i did n’t receive a single flyer			1
at the beginning of this year , i stuck a ‘ no junk mail please ’ sticker to my letterbox			1
a fortnight later i removed it when i realised it was making things worse			0
hefty load : half of a postman 's bag will be made up of junk , which is worth £ 1.1billion a year to the @entity81 some mischievous distributors were taking it as a sign to dump a handful of flyers on me in one go			1
when i pointed out the sticker to one young man who was about to deliver literature from a removal company , he just shrugged and said ‘ no understand @entity195 ’			0
increasingly , it is n’t just the door - to - door leaflet - droppers responsible for junk mail			1
a vast amount is delivered by @entity81			0
in the past 12 months it delivered 226 letters and promotional mail items from companies trying to sell me everything from wine , holidays to insurance , clothes and furniture			1
ludicrously , the companies who harassed me the most were the ones whose services i already used			0
so much for their expensive consumer research departments ! @entity218 wrote to me 26 times trying to sell me more expensive packages or get me to switch phone provider			0
@entity222 also wrote to me 16 times about their broadband or new tv sports channels			0
but as any @entity218 or @entity222 customer knows , when you have a problem with their products and really need to make contact , you ’ve got more chance of getting through to the prime minister than you have of speaking to someone who can help			0
i also received 63 letters from energy companies wanting me to switch my supply to them or simply justifying why they are sticking up their prices yet again			0
thirty - three banks and credit companies wrote offering loans and balance transfers			1
not surprisingly , half a postman ’s sack will be made up of junk post - with the @entity81 delivering 3.3 billion items a year			1
though it offers households the chance to opt out of receiving unaddressed junk mail , since it depends on £ 1.1 billion a year of such business , it does n’t make it well known			1
no wonder less than 1 per cent of homes have joined the scheme			0
i did , however , think that registering my mobile and home phones with the @entity259 would stop nuisance calls - and until about two years ago , it did			1
the service is free and it means that your number is put on a national register that marketing and telesales companies are meant to check and not contact anyone whose name appears on it			0
while reputable companies abide by the rules , a growing number of rogue ones do not			0
unstoppable : @entity274 was bombarded with more than triple the average amount of junk mail it is for that reason , i assume , that over the past year i received 137 nuisance calls and 72 texts			1
some of the phone calls , particularly those from @entity284 - based call centres , came as early as 5am , while texts pinged up any time of the day or night			2
the vast majority were from companies wrongly claiming i was owed @entity20 compensation or a pay - out after an accident			2
i also received 40 ‘ silent calls ’			0
these are from companies using @entity295 ( @entity296 )			0
targeted phone numbers are randomly chosen and automatically dialled			0
if you answer and an agent is available you ’ll be connected			0
but if you answer and no agent is free , the line just goes dead			0
a rather intimidating thing at 2am			0
during september , a company calling itself @entity304 , but using @entity284 call centre staff , called me 14 times asking me to take part in pointless surveys			0
i ’d refuse , ask them not to call again and an hour later they ’d ring back as if they ’d never spoken to me before			0
when it comes to text messages , texting ‘ stop ’ to one of the @entity20 companies is the worst thing you can do			2
it simply informs them your number is in use and leads to a flurry of additional messages			2
the problem of nuisance calls and texts has become so huge , with seven out of ten people receiving them , that consumer watchdog which ? has launched a ‘ @entity336 ’ campaign asking the government to get tough on organisations that harass people in their homes			0
@entity337 of which ? says : ‘ unwanted calls or texts are not just a nuisance , they can be intrusive and distressing			0
' many of us have been bombarded with spurious claims of @entity20 or injury compensation , and people are fed up with this nuisance and want to see action			0
‘ we want regulators to work together to police and punish those responsible			2
if they are unwilling or unable to enforce the rules , the government should step in			0
’ but the award for the biggest pest of all goes to the email spammers			0
in the past year , i have received 3,125 junk emails - that ’s despite using the highest possible security filters			1
from the @entity361 scammers telling me i ’ve inherited millions to @entity363 pharmacies wanting to sell me @entity364 , the emails arrived at a rate of nine a day			0
what i can do to reduce the spam ? apparently , not a lot			2
internet security expert @entity369 says : ‘ once your email address is publicly available online or on an illegal list , the genie can not be put back in the bottle			0
’ and as with the junk text messages , opting to unsubscribe will only alert spammers to the fact your email address is active , and you ’ll be targeted even more			1
with my own @entity381 at an end , i will shortly be taking my ten giant bin bags full of leaflets and letters to the recycling centre - and , sadly , bracing myself for the even bigger deluge that 2014 is bound to bring .			2

@entity274 tries to avoid spam , but still had 4,481 junk messages in 2013
there are ways to opt out of posted and telephone junk , but they are often not well - publicised or do not work
17.5billion items of junk mail were distributed in the @entity68 last year
