by @entity0 convinced she would never find the right man to settle down and have children with , @entity1 donated her eggs in a selfless act of generosity to help infertile women			1
following a break - up from a boyfriend of seven years , she feared she might never become a mother and at the age of 30 decided to give away her eggs because she wanted ‘ a part of me out there ’			1
however , five years later , miss @entity1 met her partner @entity14 – and in a distressing turn of events found herself needing fertility treatment after discovering they were unable to conceive			1
selfless : @entity1 gave away her eggs for @entity20 aged 30 - then discovered she would need help conceiving herself			1
after spending £ 6,000 she is now blessed with @entity22 , two , and @entity23 , four months unusual : miss @entity1 and her partner @entity14 used intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment ( @entity26 ) satisfied : but miss @entity1 could face a third child turning up on her doorstep in eight years ' time , as the law means that anyone born from her donated eggs can contact her once they 've turned 18 hoping for the best , the couple underwent two rounds of intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment ( @entity26 ) at a cost of £ 6,000 a time , and moved from their two - bedroom flat to a large family home on a new estate with good primary schools nearby			1

i became more content and went more with the flow and i was happier in our new surroundings			0
i ’d reached that point where i was no longer fighting my way up the career ladder and i was a lot more calm			0
’ fortunately for the couple , both @entity26 rounds were successful and they are now parents to @entity22 , two , and @entity23 , four months – whose birth was filmed for a forthcoming episode of the @entity62 programme @entity61			2
but as she plays with her two boys , satisfied her family is now complete , miss @entity1 is only too aware that in around eight years ’ time there could be a third child arriving on her doorstep			1
for miss @entity1 has learnt that one of the eggs she donated conceived a child – a daughter who is now ten			2

and miss @entity1 and mr @entity14 , 38 , who are due to marry this may , have had to prepare themselves for the possibility			1
