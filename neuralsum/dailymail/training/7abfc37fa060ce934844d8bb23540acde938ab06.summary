by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:36 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 13:46 est , 7 may 2013 it is one of the most anticipated pieces of technology since the @entity6 - but also one of the most feared			1
@entity10 's @entity9 wearable computer is set to go on sale to the public next year - and a growing number of complaints could see it banned in hundreds of public places by the time it launches			1
today legal experts warned of a massive ' legal brawl ' over the gadget			1
@entity10 co-founder @entity21 wearing @entity22 , the firm 's wearable computer			1
today it was revealed establishments such as cinemas , banks , parks and even strip clubs are planning to ban them amid privacy fears early ' explorer ' versions are being sold for £ 1,000 ( $ 1,500 ) , although consumer versions are expected to be significantly cheaper			1
@entity36 , an analyst firm , estimates that wearable technology and another major initiative , self - driving cars , could ultimately be a $ 500 billion opportunity for the company			1
in the shorter term , @entity42 , a forecasting firm , estimates that shipments of smart glasses , could be as high as $ 6.6 million in three years			1
already users wearing @entity22 eyewear have been told they are banned from strip clubs , cinemas and casinos because their owners do n’t want them filming there			1
in @entity54 legislators tried to make it illegal to use the gadget while driving - and plan to launch another legal attack before it becomes widely available next year			1
' this is just the beginning , ' @entity58 , a @entity59 lawyer specializing in privacy issues , told the @entity62			2
' @entity22 is going to cause quite a brawl			1
' the @entity64 , a @entity66 dive bar , was the first to explicitly ban @entity22 , launching a campaign to warn customers months before the gadget was available			1
many saw it as a publicity stunt - but dozens of places have now followed			2
experts say the gadget could challenge privacy laws around the world			2
' @entity22 will test the right to privacy versus the @entity79 , ' said @entity80 , a social media expert at @entity82			1
@entity83 , director of @entity85 privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity86 , said : ' the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip			2
@entity93 , a pioneer of wearable computing who is a technical adviser to the @entity22 team , said he and colleagues had experimented with glass - type devices for years , ' and i ca n’t think of a single instance where something bad has happened			1
' however , @entity104 computer engineering professor and wearable computer pioneer @entity103 was at a @entity107 ’s restaurant in @entity108 last when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head			2
assault : the three men , one wearing a @entity115 's shirt , another with a @entity107 's name tag , not visible , demanded to know why dr @entity103 had the glasses @entity10 has tried to play down the controversy			2
' we ’re acutely aware of those questions , ' @entity119 responded to similar concerns raised at @entity123 over the device 's abilities being so new			2
' we want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... but i ’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear , as opposed to understanding what ’s possible			2
' the people who ’ve used @entity22 , including myself , report it as remarkable			1
i ’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways , ' @entity119 said			2
nerds ! in a @entity141 gallery titled , @entity9 , photos are uploaded showing current users of the device to wide poking and name calling , one such photo pictured @entity22 offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your surroundings and while @entity10 ’s main interest is selling advertising , there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all they can to get access to a device			1
' the only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them			2
' @entity10 says that @entity22 is a work in progress , with test versions now being released to 2,000 developers			1
another 8,000 ' explorers , ' people handpicked by @entity10 , will soon get a pair after winning an online contest			2
@entity10 admits the technology is still facing issues			0
- @entity10 chairman @entity119 ' we are thinking very carefully about how we design @entity22 because new technology always raises new issues , ' said @entity177 , a @entity10 spokeswoman			1
however , the firm has also encouraged developers to experiment with the device - and at its developer conference in @entity182 next week is holding sessions dedicated to ' @entity184 '			0
' our goal is to make the world better , ' @entity10 chairman @entity119 said of the device at @entity123 last week			0
' we ’ll take the criticism along the way , but criticisms are inevitably from people who are afraid of change or who have not figured out that there will be an adaptation of society to it , ' he said			0
' we want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... but i ’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear , as opposed to understanding what ’s possible			0
' the people who ’ve used @entity22 , including myself , report it as remarkable			1
i ’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways , ' @entity119 said			0
business owners have been unimpressed			0
@entity211 , managing partner of @entity212 in @entity213 , said that patrons will be asked to check the eyewear when they come in			0
he said : ‘ we 've been dealing with the cellphone videoing and the picture taking over the years and we are quick to make sure that that does n't happen in the club			0
‘ as the sale of ( @entity22 ) spreads , there 'll be more people using them and wanting to use them at places such as a gentlemen 's club			1
‘ if we see those in the club , we would do the same thing that we do to people who bring cameras into the club			0
@entity10 has released a series of images showing off the glasses being used to capture video the glasses will also be able to take part in live video chats ‘ if they do n't want to check it , we 'd be happy to give them a limo ride back to their hotel ’			0
a spokesman for @entity247 resorts , which owns the @entity248 in @entity213 , said that picture - taking was ‘ frowned upon ’ inside its properties			0
he said : ‘ security officers on duty ask individuals not to take pictures for the privacy of others in the casino			0
‘ this new product is nothing new in terms of a challenge for us , because for so many years , the very tiniest of portable lipstick and pinpoint cameras have been around			0
’ @entity265 , one of the largest cinema chains in the @entity268 , added that no recording devices were permitted into its cinemas			1
the @entity271 is one of the first to ban @entity22 with a quiet wink of an eye @entity22 users will now be able to take a picture thanks to one of many new apps released and currently in development for the device			1
snap ! a new app for @entity22 called @entity281 allows users to take pictures with the blink of an eye ordinarily @entity22 users must deliver an audible command of , ' ok , @entity22 , take a picture , ' to kick in the camera 's software			1
however with its release this week program @entity291 will additionally give users the option of silently ordering the command			0
' you might not think it 's hard to say " ok , @entity299 " or even just tap a button			0
but it 's a context switch that takes you out of the moment , even if just for a second , ' @entity291 's developer @entity301 from @entity302 explained on his @entity307 page on wednesday			0
' i 've taken more pictures today than i have the past 5 days thanks to this , ' he continued			0
' sure , they are mostly silly , but my timeline has now truly become a timeline of where i 've been			0
' however while pirating images of subjects in public may be one use for the device , speaking like one will not be allowed , as @entity320 has revealed			0
@entity10 's voice translation technology censors curse words , prohibiting its user from for instance sending a voice - written email containing an explicative			0
currently there is said to be no way to disable to filter , which would work similar to @entity10 's @entity330 option , the website reports .			0

cinemas , casinos and strip clubs have already banned @entity22
calls for a driving ban to be put in place before it launches
bars have already banned the *headwear* , months before it goes on sale
