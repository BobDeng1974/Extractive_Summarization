they 've been employing a recent display of frugality , in keeping with the scale of the economic crisis facing @entity5			1
and it seems the @entity5 royal family 's new austere stance is n't about to change - even for the most important event in the past 40 years			1
although plans have not yet been announced , it appears that the imminent coronation of prince @entity13 could also be a rather modest affair			1
crown prince @entity13 of @entity5 and @entity15 of @entity5 visited a students ' residence in @entity18 earlier today , as news emerged of the low - key scale of the king - in - waiting 's plans for an austere coronation the event , which is understood to be taking place on june 19 , will be a secular event and will instead feature just a simple proclamation , as well as a military procession , in front of @entity5 politicians			1
@entity30 and government spokesmen have already said no foreign dignitaries will be invited to the ceremony , largely due to the late notice given to plan the event			2
even prince @entity13 ’s father , @entity36 , has signalled he does not intend to be at the ceremony to see his son take over his throne			1
but fervent royalists have attacked the plans , saying a low - key affair would waste a rare opportunity to showcase @entity5 on the global stage			1
monarchist newspaper @entity44 said the austerity policy threatened to tarnish the handover , claiming in an editorial : ' unless we see a sudden change in strategy that could save the celebration , @entity5 looks set to miss out on an historic opportunity to project its image abroad			0
' political leaders are also said to be trying to persuade the royal family to change its mind about the foreign dignitaries , although observers say it has probably been left too late			0
but a palace spokesman said there would not be room in parliament for an extended guest list , saying : ' we are n’t going to make people come just to leave them outside			0
' it is believed the steps are being taken at the request of @entity13 , who wants a smaller celebration than that of his father @entity36 , who was crowned four decades ago after the death of dictator @entity76 in 1975			1
it is the third time in as many days that the heir to the throne and his glamorous wife have been pictured at public events , showing they are ready for the coronation , which is due to take place next week it seems the king - in - waiting has made the request out of awareness of the economic crisis devastating the country , as well as weekend republican protests in several parts of the country			1
but despite the lack of ceremony around the occasion , it is expected that the new king and his wife @entity15 will present themselves to the public from the balcony of the official @entity30 in @entity18 after the event			2
@entity36 and his wife @entity104 did the same after the coronation in 1975			2
it is thought the couple will then embark on a royal tour of foreign nations , beginning with @entity5 's neighbours @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
when @entity36 was sworn in a king , pictured above , it was a much larger affair than what is expected from the imminent coronation of crown prince @entity13 , pictured third from right as a young boy			1
the event included a mass after the coronation which is not expected to be held this time around @entity36 was crowned in 1975 after the death of @entity76 , pictured left			2
after the coronation , he and @entity104 greeted @entity5 from the balcony of the @entity30 in @entity18 , right but despite the planned low - key nature of the event , the king - in - waiting and his wife have been putting in several public appearances over the past few days to prove they are ready for the statesmanship that awaits them			1
princess @entity15 of @entity5 has oozed class at three different events in as many days , including a visit to student residences today in @entity18 , @entity5			0
the princess and her husband also joined the royal family at a lavish gala dinner on tuesday , as part of celebrations to welcome the @entity145 president , @entity144 , to @entity5			0
after that , they ' dressed down ' to receive members of the @entity149 at the @entity30 in @entity18			0
king @entity36 , who has been on the throne for nearly 40 years , announced last week that he was abdicating she had already spent the afternoon networking , at a reception hosted by @entity36 for the arriving president on the steps of the @entity156 , in @entity18			0
the events , although arranged to welcome the @entity145 president to @entity5 , were a chance for princess @entity15 to publicly show her support for her husband			0
@entity36 of @entity5 announced last week that he planned to end his four - decade reign in favour of his 46 - year - old son			1
and earlier today , the @entity5 @entity164 voted overwhelmingly in favor of urgent government legislation allowing @entity36 to abdicate and hand over his duties to crown prince @entity13			1
the shock decision to end his 39 - year reign came days after it was claimed @entity36 told courtiers he decided to abdicate because he did not want his son to ‘ wither ’ and ‘ grow old waiting for the throne like @entity175 ’			2
in a televised address , the 76 - year - old said he wanted to herald in a ‘ new era of hope ’ and ensure a ‘ younger generation … with new energies ’ could take over the helm			0
according to reports in the @entity5 press , the king told aides he felt the time was right to pass the throne on while prince @entity13 was still a young man			1
‘ i do not want my son to wither waiting like @entity175 , ’ he reportedly told @entity189 , chief of the royal household			0
prince @entity13 and his wife @entity15 were seen at a reception for the @entity145 president as well as a royal gala dinner earlier this week as they prepare for their new roles as state heads of the country the private secretary said the king – whose popularity has slumped in recent years following a series of scandals – had been considering abdicating since his 75th birthday in january last year			1
however , last week , a source at the royal palace in @entity18 claimed @entity36 was abdicating for political reasons			0
the monarch ’s popularity has nosedived amid accusations of being out of touch as his country struggles with its worst economic crisis in memory			2
in 2012 , he was widely criticised for going on a secret hunting trip to @entity217 to shoot elephants			0
the lavish holiday contrasted with the news at home that one in four @entity5 workers was jobless			0
prince @entity175 has been waiting for 62 years and four months – longer than any other heir apparent in @entity225 history – to take the throne			0
he became heir apparent at the age of three when his mother , then princess @entity229 , who is now 88 , acceded in 1952 .			0

crown prince @entity13 , 46 , is due to be enthroned as @entity231 on june 19
the coronation will be a low - key secular affair in front of @entity5 politicians
his father @entity36 said he might not even attend the ceremony
