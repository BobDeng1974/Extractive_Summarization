by @entity0 you might have played popular video game , @entity3 , but for some shrubs it is already too late			0
for the first time , scientists have revealed how bacterial parasites can turn plants into the living dead			0
a parasitic bacterium , called phytoplasmas , hijacks the reproductive organs of a plant and sterilises it so that the plants stay alive , but only for the good of the pathogen			1
this ensures that the bacteria is spread far and wide			0
other parasites are known to infect and control the brains of ants and can make rats more susceptible to predation			0
‘ we know these parasites are puppet masters but the strings they are pulling have yet to be identified , ’ said professor @entity42 from the @entity43 in @entity44			2
‘ for the first time , we can reveal how this remarkable manipulation takes place [ in plants ]			0
' in that sense , the plant world is ahead of animal biology – where manipulations also take place but no mechanisms have been uncovered to show how			0
’ the plant parasite in her study is spread by insects that grow on plants			1
it induces the plant to transform its flowers into leaves , sacrificing its reproductive success and becoming sterile			2
it becomes a zombie plant with no prospect of reproducing and is dependent on the survival of the bacteria			0
together with scientists at @entity77 in the @entity78 , the team discovered that the parasitic bacterium produces a protein called @entity81 that is essential to this process			2
and the protein is dependent on a family of plant proteins called @entity85			0
the carrier : infected plant parts are eaten by leafhoppers ( pictured ) and the bacteria then colonises the insects , including their salivary glands			1
if the insect dribbles saliva as it sucks on another plant , the bacteria are able to spread onto new plant tissue , where the sterilisation process begins again the bacterium affects a broad range of plants , turning flowers green , transforming them into leaf tissue or producing a profusion of stems known as @entity104			1
it is currently controlled by pesticides because it can also infect crops including : maize , wheat , carrots , tomatoes , potato , oilseed rape , and grapes			0
the scientists hope that their breakthrough could lead to new ways of controlling the bacteria by disrupting the protein without using pesticides			1
infected plant parts are eaten by leafhoppers and the bacterium then colonises the insects , including their salivary glands			1
feeling green : the first sign that the parasite has taken hold of a plant ( a healthy version is pictured left ) is that its flower petals slowly turn green ( pictured right ) before being transformed into a more leaf - like tissue if the insect dribbles saliva as it sucks on another plant , the bacterium is able to spread onto new plant tissue , where it sets to work on making the plant more attractive to leafhoppers			1
the @entity81 and @entity85 proteins force the plant to transform its flowers into leaf - like material and become more attractive to leafhoppers			2
the leafhoppers pick up the bacterium from infected plants and can then spread the bacterial pathogen to more plants			1
professor @entity42 said : ‘ this parasite is incapable of surviving without its insect and plant hosts and we showed that a parasite protein connects distinct processes in its host plant to manipulate both the plant and the insect			0
dr @entity159 , of the @entity43 , who is the lead author of the study , published in the journal @entity162 , said : ‘ it is fascinating to consider that this bacterium is able to manipulate the way plants grow and the way insects behave to suit its own needs			1

after sterilisation caused by a parasite called phytoplasmas , the plants stay alive - but only for the good of the pathogen
the petals turn green to look like leaves and attract insects that will help the parasite spread to other *nearby* plants
it affects a range of plants , turning flowers into leaf tissue or producing a profusion of stems known as @entity104
*researchers* from the @entity43 , @entity44 , *explained* infected plant parts are eaten by leafhoppers , which spread the parasite
hope that their breakthrough could lead to new ways of controlling the bacterium by disrupting the protein without using pesticides
