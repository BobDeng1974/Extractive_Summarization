' @entity4 ' : the school sent the @entity43 a letter explaining that @entity12 's appearance did n't meet the school 's ' biblical standards sad : @entity12 wants to go back to @entity36 because her friends are all there in the letter , administrators remind the @entity62 that the school can refuse to admit a student if that student is ' condoning sexual immorality , practicing a homosexual lifestyle or alternative gender identity			1
' it then goes on to cite specific @entity46 versus			0
