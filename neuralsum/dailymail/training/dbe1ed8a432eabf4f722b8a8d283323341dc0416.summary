a 21 - year - old woman claims to have paid $ 20,000 to surgically add a third breast in a desperate bid to become a reality tv star			1
@entity4 , not her real name , insists she was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure			1
now , she has hired a camera crew to follow her around @entity11 , @entity12 , documenting the ' struggles ' she faces as a three - breasted woman			1
she is now filming her own reality show about the struggles she faces as a three - breasted woman while the procedure is possible , surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to ' human dignity '			1
the ethical code outlined by the @entity26 dictates that ' the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity			1
' cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely ' enhance the norm ' of a patient 's body			2
however , @entity4 claims she found a surgeon who agreed to carry out the unusual operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret			1
she says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements			1
the massage therapist , who recently celebrated her 21st birthday , has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her @entity57 fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate			2
and she has proudly declared that she been disowned by her mother and sister , who ran out the room in disgust when they saw what she had done			2
' my mum ran out of the door			0
she wo n't talk to me			0
she wo n't let my sister talk to me , ' @entity4 said			1
dreams of being a star : the massage therapist from @entity11 , @entity12 , said her dream is to have a show on @entity76 ' my dad â€¦ he really is n't happy			2
he is kind of ashamed of me but he accepted it			0
' however , @entity4 insists she has no regrets as she prepares to send pilot episodes of her self - produced reality show titled @entity4 's jugs to @entity76			1
' my whole dream is to get this show on @entity76 , ' she told @entity85 104.1			0
' i 'm dumping every penny i have into this			0
if this does n't work , i 'm through			0
' @entity88 , president - elected of the @entity26 blasted the stunt as ' worse than unethical ' and ' harmful to society '			2
he told @entity92 that the operation appears to be legitimate and said : ' this violates every ethical principle not just in surgery but in medicine as well			2
' we look to enhance the norm			0
this is not the norm			0
' nothing speaks louder than the fact that the surgeon required the patient to sign a non-disclosure form			2
' reminiscent : her new look is similar to that of the three - breasted prostitute in the 1990 film @entity109 disowned : @entity4 , who recently celebrated her 21st birthday , says she has been disowned by her mother mr @entity88 said the case will likely be reported to the national board of plastic surgeons and if the surgeon is tracked down they could have their license revoked			1
' i meet with patients twice before the operation to make sure they are doing it for the right reasons			0
' these are not the right reasons , this is sensationalist and quite frankly horrible			0
' despite scheduling interviews , creating a fan page , and hiring a film crew , @entity4 insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous			1
' i got it because i wanted to make myself unattractive to men , ' she claims			0
' because i do n't want to date anymore			0
' the new look is reminiscent of the alluring three - breasted prostitute who parades around semi-topless in the 1990 @entity135 film @entity109			1
the bizarre character prompted one of the most famous movie quotes to date , as a man declares : ' baby , you make me wish i had three hands ! '			0

@entity4 , 21 , ' paid $ 20,000 to add a breast to become a tv star '
she was ' rejected by 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes '
it took her two years to find willing surgeon who would also add a nipple
she now has a film crew tracking her ' struggles as a three - breasted woman '
