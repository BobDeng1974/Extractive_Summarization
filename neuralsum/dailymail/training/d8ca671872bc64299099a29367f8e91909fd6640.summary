traditional remedies for the condition have always been a rather hic and miss affair			1
but the days of attempting to drink water upside down , having someone inflict a shock on you , or holding your breath as long as possible could be over			1
an inventor claims to have developed a device that stops the hiccups every time			2
the user bites down on the stick and drinks a glass of water through the hole			1
it appears the hiccups are stopped by the combination of drinking the water and biting the stick , which makes the throat muscles tense			1
the idea was developed after inventor @entity31 had a bout of hiccups and decided to experiment by drinking a glass of water with a pen in his mouth – and it eased his symptoms			1
he said : ‘ they did n’t stop immediately but it was enough to make me believe i was on to something			2
’ inventor @entity31 came up with the idea in frustration after suffering from bouts of hiccups throughout his life and trying to cure them by drinking water through a pen he spent a month developing his idea and getting it tested			1
mr @entity31 added : ‘ soon i was getting calls back from people who were amazed at the results			2
in every single case it worked to stop hiccups , from kids as young as three to adults in their 80s			2
‘ it even worked with several people with more serious chronic hiccups			0
’ more than 10,000 @entity66 have now been sold at a cost of £ 13 for a pack of three online			0
hiccups are a result of the layer of muscle below the ribcage , known as the diaphragm , suddenly and involuntarily contracting			0
not all doctors are convinced by @entity78 mr @entity31 ’s idea , pointing out that hiccups normally subside anyway			0
the @entity14 may help those such as @entity79 , of @entity80 , who has been hiccuping every day for almost five years since she was expecting her daughter @entity81			1
despite giving birth in june 2008 and having a second daughter @entity84 this year , her hiccups have not stopped			0
she said : ‘ it ’s usually just one very loud one every hour			0
i ’ve tried everything , all the old wives ’ tales			0
’ now watch the video			0

the ' @entity14 ' works in the same was as traditional cure of drinking water upside down , ' but without the mess '
the inventors are so confident they have *offered* *buyers* a ' money back *guarantee* '
