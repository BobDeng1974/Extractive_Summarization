by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 02:17 est , 8 may 2012 @entity1 is launching a battle against @entity4 plans to force the government to allow non-europeans a benefit allowance			1
they have been angered by an @entity4 proposal to sign a deal with @entity11 without @entity1 ’s agreement , which could mean @entity11 citizens ’ would gain access to the @entity1 welfare system			1
@entity16 , the employment minister , has told @entity1 officials in @entity18 to argue against the plans later this month , which encroach further on @entity1 sovereignty			2
under fire : @entity18 is planning to sign a deal with @entity11 without @entity1 's consent that could extend its citizens ' access to the @entity1 social security system he is concerned that the move will pave the way for welfare deals with other countries outside the @entity4			1
mr @entity16 said : ' the government takes the very firm view there should be no opening up of our welfare system to people coming from abroad who do not intend to work and contribute to @entity1 society			1
' our arrangements are for @entity1 to decide , not @entity18			2
i ’m not happy with the way that the @entity4 is behaving			2
@entity44 should not be negotiating social security agreements on our behalf , that ’s why we ’re going through the courts to stop them , ' reported @entity49			0
fight : @entity16 , the employment minister , is concerned that the move will pave the way for welfare deals with other countries outside the @entity4 the deal will not suddenly allow @entity11 migrants to claim a pension - the @entity1 already has a treaty with @entity11 dating from 1961 which gives access to social security benefits			1
instead @entity1 ’s concern is the principle of the @entity4 meddling – there are implications that once @entity18 has gained power over who can receive benefits , it could be extended in the future			1
in theory , this could mean citizens of other countries could claim benefits in @entity1 without the government 's consent			2
the move could lead to the @entity1 forking out millions more in welfare payments , curtailing attempts to cut the deficit			1
there are also concerns that encourage it could benefit tourists to exploit @entity1 ’s welfare system			1
but the @entity44 commission said the deal would simply mean migrant workers were not put at a financial disadvantage when moving between states			0
it stated that @entity11 migrants will not suddenly be able to claim pension benefits , unless they have contributed by working in the country and the move was to ' simplify administrative arrangement			0
' ' it is highly misleading and irresponsible to suggest that the proposal fora council decision concerning the @entity4 position on social security coordination with @entity11 would create any new rights for @entity102 workers – it would not			2
the proposal would simply facilitate the administration of existing rights , ' said a @entity107 spokesperson			0
' this proposed new decision creates new reciprocal rights for @entity4 workers who have worked in @entity11 , ' he added			0
some government officials see the move by the @entity107 as sneaky - the @entity114 treaty , which became law in 2009 , gave @entity1 the ability to agree or disagree on agreements between @entity18 and non-eu countries			1
but the commission is trying to push through the deal a part of the treaty that is usually reserved to govern relations between member states			0
@entity11 , which has a population of 75 million citizens , has been trying to join the @entity4 for years			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity127 has previously backed the country 's accession , and points to @entity11 's growing economy as a reason			0
@entity11 's @entity4 negotiations have previously been overshadowed by concerns about freedom of speech and democracy in @entity11 and treatment of religious minorities , women 's and children 's rights			0
there are also issues about civilian control of the military and the @entity145 tensions .			0

fears move could lead to pave the way for welfare deals with countries outside the @entity4
@entity153 ministers are worried it could cost @entity1 millions in welfare *payouts* and encourage benefit tourists
