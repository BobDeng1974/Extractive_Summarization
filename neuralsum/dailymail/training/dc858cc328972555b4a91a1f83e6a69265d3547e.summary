it is something that will surely come as a surprise to few of us			0
people who live or work near takeaways eat more junk food and are almost twice as likely to be obese as those who have none on their doorstep , a study has found			1
consumers who are the most tempted by takeaways and fast food eat an extra 40g of high calorie food - the same as half a small serving of @entity20 ’s fries - every week compared to those who stay away			1
warning : people who live or work near takeaways eat more junk food and are almost twice as likely to be obese working near a fast food place or takeaway caused the biggest problems , closely followed by them being located near the home			1
the research , published online in the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , is the first @entity32 study to combine data from home , work and commuting and involved 5,442 adults from @entity38 aged 29 to 62			0
on average , people were exposed to 32 takeaway outlets - nine each in their local neighbourhood and on their commute , and 14 within a mile of work			0
there were around 48 per cent more takeaway outlets and fast food joints near work compared to home , the study found			1
researchers examined how much takeaway food people ate using questionnaires for foods such as pizza , burgers , fried food ( such as fried chicken ) and chips			0
they also measured people ’s body mass index ( @entity60 ) as a measure of their weight			0
the results showed that people exposed to the highest number of takeaways were 80 per cent more likely to be obese and 20 per cent more likely to have a higher @entity60 than those with the lowest number of encounters			0
they also ate more of these types of foods			0
the researchers said : ' compared with people least exposed to takeaway food outlets , we estimate those most exposed consumed an additional 5.7g per day of takeaway food , which would constitute a 15 per cent higher consumption than those least exposed			2
those most tempted by takeaways and fast food eat an extra 40g of high calorie food - the same as half a small serving of @entity20 's fries - every week ' in a week , this translates into an additional 39.9g of takeaway food			1
this weekly amount constitutes more than half a small serving of @entity20 ’s french fries ( typically 71g per serving )			1
' over the past decade , consumption of food outside the home has increased by 29 per cent , while at the same time , the number of takeaway food outlets has increased dramatically , the researchers said			1
this , they argued , could be contributing to rising levels of overweight and obesity			0
dr @entity102 , lead author of the study from the @entity32 ’s centre for diet and activity research , based in the @entity108 ’s epidemiology unit at the @entity109 , said : “ the foods we eat away from home tend to be less healthy than the meals we prepare ourselves			2
' therefore it is important to consider how exposure to food outlets selling these high calorie foods in our day - to - day environments might be influencing consumption			1
' our study provides new evidence that there is some kind of relationship between the number of takeaway food outlets we encounter , our consumption of these foods , and how much we weigh			2
' of course this is likely to be just one of a number of factors that contribute to a person ’s risk of developing obesity			2
' however , our findings do suggest that taking steps to restrict takeaway outlets in our towns and cities , particularly around workplaces , may be one way of positively influencing our diet and health			0
' professor @entity145 , chairwoman of the @entity108 ’s population health sciences group , added : ' to date , studies examining the link between the neighbourhood food environment and diet and body weight have provided mixed results , which is why it ’s important that we continue to study these relationships			1
over the past decade , consumption of food outside the home has increased by 29 per cent - and this has been linked to obesity ' in future , this type of research will provide the robust evidence needed to develop effective strategies to tackle obesity and promote a healthier lifestyle			1
' @entity166 , heart health dietitian at the @entity168 ( @entity168 ) , which helped fund the study , said : ' we already know that people are spending more than ever on takeaways and food eaten away from home , and that these foods are often less healthy than the meals we make ourselves			2
' this is a worrying trend given that a quarter of adults in the @entity32 are already obese , putting them at greater risk of heart disease			0
' while this study ca n’t prove someone ’s local environment can cause them to become obese , it ’s vital we have the tools to make healthy choices when eating takeaways or food in a restaurant			2
' clearly signposting healthy meal options , providing clear nutritional information , and offering appropriate portion sizes can help this			0

those most tempted by fast food eat extra 40g of high calorie food a week
this is the same as half a small serving of @entity20 ’s fries
consumption of food has increase by 29 *%* over the past decade
health *experts* say this must be partly to blame for *soaring* obesity
