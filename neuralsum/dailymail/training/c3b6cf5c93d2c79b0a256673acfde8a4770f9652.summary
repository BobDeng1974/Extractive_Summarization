asked on monday to reflect on his record against @entity2 as @entity4 manager - played five , won none - @entity5 smiled ruefully and recalled the last time the teams met , at @entity7 at the start of november			1
‘ let ’s face it , it was not just the @entity2 game early in the season ... there were plenty of other games we did n’t do well in			2
but at this moment , there is a different feeling , a different aggression , a different mood in the squad so hopefully we can go into these two games and be positive			2
’ there , in a nutshell , is the essence of tuesday night ’s first leg of the @entity28 semi-final			1
the extent to which this is a new @entity4 , a reborn @entity4 , will shape the nature of a tie that begins on @entity33 on tuesday and ends next week in west @entity34			1
@entity5 has failed to win any of his five games against @entity2 as @entity4 manager @entity2 's ( from left ) @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 celebrates the @entity44 ' 2 - 1 victory over @entity4 at @entity7 back in november @entity45 celebrates scoring @entity4 's second against @entity47 in a 2 - 0 win on saturday @entity5 believes there is a ' different mood ' around @entity4 to when they last faced @entity2 we know what we will get from @entity2			1
@entity54 ’s side are strong , dextrous , physically intimidating and have one of @entity57 ’s most prolific goalscorers in @entity58			2
@entity4 , on the other hand , are tentatively emerging from a slump that began when @entity2 ended their @entity62 title hopes last april			1
but are @entity4 improving enough to slug it out with @entity2 over two legs ? or do victories against teams such as @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity47 count for little when faced with an enduring @entity71 heavyweight ? certainly , opportunity knocks for @entity4			1
not only are they in far better form than they were when @entity2 came from behind to beat them 2 - 1 in november , their opponents will go into next week ’s second leg with one eye on a league fixture with champions @entity78 the following saturday			1
‘ they are very strong , so yes , it ’s the biggest test in @entity81 football right now , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ you see their quality			0
they are a very good side			2
but we will look at it as an opportunity to win at home			0
‘ now our confidence is high , and we are looking forward to it , because we go into it on the back of a decent run			2
‘ against @entity2 , we have n’t played as well as we would have liked in my time here			1
it would be good to change that			0
’ in fairness to @entity5 , some of his team ’s performances against @entity2 - such as an unjust and narrow defeat at @entity103 last @entity104 - have been better than the results			1
@entity106 ( right ) and his @entity4 team - mates look devastated during the loss to @entity2 last april @entity54 ( right ) holds the ball under his shoulder and @entity5 looks on during the match last april @entity2 players celebrate @entity114 's opening goal at @entity7 during @entity2 's 2 - 0 victory @entity5 ( left ) and @entity54 gesture from the touchline during the huge @entity62 clash last april there has been evidence , too , in recent weeks that the players who can make a difference - such as @entity122 , @entity123 and now @entity124 - are beginning to find something approaching their optimum form in @entity5 ’ new formation			1
certainly @entity2 captain @entity40 knows from experience that trips to @entity7 can go very wrong very quickly if you are n’t prepared			1
‘ it ’s going to be a tough place to go , ’ said the veteran defender			0
‘ they proved , when we went up there in the league , that it ’s a tough game			0
‘ you have to forget form and where they are			0
it ’s @entity2 - @entity4			1
it ’s going to be tough over the two legs and i just hope we are strong enough			0
@entity58 ( right ) smashes in @entity2 's second at @entity7 in november to give the @entity44 victory reds captain @entity106 ( right ) appeals to referee @entity148 for a penalty against @entity2 in november ‘ we have shown in the first half of the season that we are capable of pushing the top sides and that is what we aim to do			1
’ @entity5 spoke glowingly of some of @entity2 ’s players on monday , especially costa			1
‘ i love his game , ’ he said			0
the @entity4 manager also knows the value of winning your first trophy in charge of a new club , having been on the @entity2 staff when @entity54 steered his team past @entity4 in the 2005 @entity28 final in @entity167			1
‘ i joined @entity2 2004 , ’ he reflected			2
‘ at that point they were a club who wanted to win titles and trophies			0
they showed once you win that first one , you want to go on and sustain it			0
@entity58 scores against @entity68 on saturday during @entity2 's 5 - 0 rout of the @entity177 side @entity40 slides in to challenge @entity68 's @entity178 during @entity2 's 5 - 0 win on saturday ‘ the first one is really important and the players who were there then will tell you that			1
they will tell you that getting across the line on the first one is important			0
i think it is that taste of success that hopefully pushes players on			0
‘ we have worked really hard in the majority of the two - and - a - half years of my time here but we are here to win			0
we are club that is synonymous with winning trophies			0
we want to get that back again and hopefully we can do that this season			0
’ victory on tuesday night would certainly give @entity4 a sight of @entity194			2
they start as underdogs and , given their troubles with confidence at times this season , that may be no bad thing			0
attacking midfielder @entity41 dribbles forward with the ball against @entity68			0

@entity4 host @entity2 in @entity28 semi-final first leg on tuesday
@entity5 played @entity2 five times as @entity208 boss and not won
but @entity5 *insists* his @entity4 side will ' be positive ' against @entity44
@entity2 beat @entity208 2 - 1 in @entity62 back in november
@entity208 boss is *adamant* there is a ' different mood ' around @entity7 now
