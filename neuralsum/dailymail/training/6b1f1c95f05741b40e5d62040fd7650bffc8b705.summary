by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 09:41 est , 30 october 2012 a row erupted over the future of @entity4 ’s nuclear deterrent yesterday			0
tories and @entity6 clashed over whether to build a new generation of @entity9 submarines			1
defence secretary @entity10 announced contracts worth £ 350million to design the boats now based at the @entity14 naval complex of @entity15 – an apparent bid to show voters in @entity14 what they would be losing if they vote for independence			1
an unarmed @entity9 ( @entity24 ) ballistic missile is pictured launching last week @entity25 , left , denounced @entity10 's announced contracts worth £ 350million as ' jumping the gun ' but deputy prime minister @entity25 angrily denounced the move as ‘ jumping the gun ’ , since the main decision to proceed will not have to be taken until 2016			1
@entity30 made clear last week that he favours retention of the present continuous sea deterrent involving four nuclear - powered submarines			0
but the @entity6 have set up a review to find a cheaper alternative , which could see them recommend a reduction in the @entity9 fleet , a move to short - range missiles on an existing submarine or a move to air - launched nuclear missiles			1
that is regarded by @entity5 and senior @entity46 figures as a cut - price solution that would end @entity4 ’s independent nuclear deterrent and undermine national security			0
the @entity5 estimate the cost of replacing @entity9 at £ 20billion , but the @entity6 warn it may cost £ 50billion			1
despite knowing about the announcement since last week , @entity6 expressed dismay that the defence secretary had chosen to depict the awarding of the contracts as a key stage towards renewing @entity9			1
trident : the @entity6 have set up a review to find a cheaper alternative , which could see them recommend a reduction in the @entity9 fleet @entity63 preparing to fire an unarmed @entity9 ( @entity24 ) ballistic missile , during a test launch in the @entity66 last week mr @entity25 said : ‘ i think some people are jumping the gun on this			1
the final decision on @entity9 replacement will not be taken until 2016 , however much other people may not like it that way			2
‘ the idea of a like - for - like entirely unchanged replacement of @entity9 is basically saying we will spend billions and billions and billions of pounds on a nuclear missile system designed with the sole strategic purpose of flattening @entity80 at the press of a button			1
’ the row spread confusion about the policy			0
a weapons engineering officer pulling the trigger during a rehearsed @entity9 missile firing onboard a boat as @entity30 made clear he favours retention of the present continuous sea deterrent involving four nuclear - powered submarines a @entity95 spokesman first said that the government ’s policy was ‘ unchanged ’ and that ‘ we ’re still committed to that at - sea nuclear deterrent ’			2
but she later said the @entity6 review ‘ will inform ’ the government ’s plans			2
however sources said mr @entity30 has ‘ no intention ’ of changing his mind			0
the row overshadowed attempts by mr @entity10 to make political capital out of his announcement in @entity14 , where the @entity110 government has said it wants to abolish the nuclear deterrent			2
the defence secretary said that the investment would help secure 6,500 jobs on the @entity115 but @entity110 leader @entity116 claims only 520 are directly dependent on the nuclear facilities			1
in a bid to drum up votes in the 2014 referendum on @entity14 independence , mr @entity10 said he intends to move more submarines based in @entity123 to @entity15			2
he added : ‘ right now there are 3,200 civilian jobs on this base , as well as many thousands of military jobs , and that number will increase as we go through the decade			0
’ but @entity14 deputy first minister @entity131 attacked the @entity132 for ‘ dumping ’ weapons of mass destruction on @entity14 and said that an independent parliament would use its share of @entity9 cash on public services			1
the @entity6 have expressed interest in mounting nuclear warheads on cruise missiles fired from @entity143 hunter killer submarines			2
but a senior @entity46 official told the @entity145 that each of the alternative policies is implausible if the @entity4 wants to maintain a credible deterrent			0
only the @entity4 , the @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 can deploy submarines anywhere in the world unseen and capable of delivering missiles over a range of more than 7,000 miles			0
the source said : ‘ astute class submarines are designed for an entirely different purpose			0
range would be reduced to hundreds of miles rather than many thousands			0

defence secretary announced contracts to design boats at @entity14 base
@entity6 set up review to find cheaper alternative , which could see a possible reduction in @entity9 fleet and move to short - range missiles
