just seven months after he left his post at @entity2 to join the @entity4 team , @entity0 seems to have landed a very big promotion			1
a grinning and giddy @entity0 joined @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 this morning as one of the four anchors on today			2
the move comes just one month after his six month non-compete clause with @entity14 expired			1
this is a big move up for @entity0 , and something that will likely anger execs over at @entity14			0
at the time of his departure from the rival network , it was said he would be working with @entity4 , and would appear on today only to do sports - related segments			0
this morning however , @entity0 looked very comfortable filling in , bringing in some of the banter and humor that he used to help @entity2 topple today in the ratings race starting back in april of 2012 , after the show 's 16 year run as the most watched morning news program			1
thrilled : @entity0 shared his excitement about hosting the morning news program on @entity45 today the show has continued to struggle in the ratings since then , pulling in just 4.7 million viewers the week of october 13 as opposed to @entity2 's 5.4 million , this according to tv newser			1
and while @entity51 has kept things simple with just four anchors , @entity54 , @entity22 , @entity55 , and @entity23 , along with meteorologist @entity21 , on camera during the two hour program , today now has nine anchors spread out over four hours of television , including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity17 and @entity63 , in addition to @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity25 and @entity9			0
old pals : @entity67 ( right ) and pal @entity66 ( middle ) left @entity2 within months of one another , with @entity0 being replaced by @entity23 ( left ) personal life : @entity67 ( left ) is engaged to @entity72 news anchor @entity71 ( second from right , seen with @entity73 and @entity74 ) there is no word yet if @entity0 will now be a permanent fixture on the show , or will just be stopping by in the absence of @entity25			2
@entity0 , who is engaged to @entity72 's @entity14 news anchor @entity71 , wanted to get out of his gig at @entity2 so badly that he reportedly took a pay cut to head over to @entity4 back on march 30			1
@entity83 reported that @entity0 felt slighted over the $ 14 million contract @entity54 signed to stay on as anchor of the program , as he was only offered an annual salary somewhere between $ 4 and $ 5 million			0
permanent gig : it is uncertain in @entity0 will now be a regular fixture on today , or just fill in when @entity25 is absent , as she was this morning he ended up signing a contract for just over $ 3 million a year to go to @entity4 , with no promise he would ever be on today			2
the move came just a few months after his good friend @entity66 also left the program to take a job with @entity97			0
@entity0 was replaced by @entity23 while @entity74 was replaced by @entity98 .			0

@entity0 made his first appearance as a *co-anchor* on today this morning , filling in for @entity25
this comes 7 months after the tv *journalist* took a pay cut to leave @entity2 for @entity4 , with no promise he would be on today
@entity0 had a six month non-compete clause barring him from appearing on today until this month
today continues to struggle in the ratings against @entity2 , with the @entity14 program pulling in over *500,000* more viewers the week of october 13
