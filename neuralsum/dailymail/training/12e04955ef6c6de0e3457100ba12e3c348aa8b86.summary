she lashed out against the 101 female @entity30 swept into @entity16 by @entity31 ; s landslide election in 1997			1
miss @entity2 said too many of them thought they were treated rudely by opponents because they were women – when i fact they just were not very good			2
babes : many of the women swept into @entity16 by @entity31 's first @entity41 landslide in 1997 were not up to the job , miss @entity2 suggested useless : the 101 female @entity30 ' might as well have been the 101 @entity43 ' she said : ‘ i vividly remember that about six months after the @entity45 came in – you may remember them ? 101 of them came in and i always thought they might as well have had the 101 @entity43			1
