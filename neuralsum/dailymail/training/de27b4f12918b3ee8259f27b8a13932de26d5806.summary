think hondas are boring ? well this one might change your mind			0
unveiled this week at the @entity5 , its long awaited new @entity4 supercar will blow away a few cobwebs			0
and it 's a petrol electric sport hybrid that is green as well as bright red			1
with its aerodynamic , low slung features , the @entity4 , pictured below , looks more @entity10 than @entity11 but certainly does have all that @entity12			1
a combination of the 550bhp twin - turbo @entity14 at the rear and two of its three electric motors fixed on the axle towards the front gives independent drive to each wheel , via a 9 - speed dual - clutch automatic gearbox			1
the long awaited @entity4 supercar ( pictured ) was unveiled this week at the @entity5 the third electric motor , between the engine and the gearbox , aids smooth acceleration , braking and gear changes			1
in @entity33 and mainland @entity34 it will be sold as a @entity11			0
but in the @entity36 it will carry the badge of @entity38 , @entity11 's upmarket luxury arm , which is to the @entity41 company what @entity42 is to @entity44 , and @entity45 to @entity46			1
it features a space - frame construction using ultra high strength steel and aluminium , with a carbon - fibre floor and ultra-thin pillars			1
a @entity11 executive , who really should get out more , described it as a ' human - centred supercar '			1
but it 's fair to say that the driver is cocooned in a fighter aircraft style cockpit with sculpted sports seats			1
there are four driving modes : quiet , sport , sport - plus and track , for those days when you might fancy an all - out burn - up around a racing track , rather than risking your licence			1
to help haul its 19 - in front and 20 - in rear alloy wheels to a halt , it has powerful carbon ceramic brakes			1
a cluster of four exhaust pipes adds a flourish to the rear			1
though a @entity41 icon , the @entity4 will be built at the @entity79 ( @entity80 ) in @entity81 , @entity82 , from imported and home - sourced parts			2
it is the second generation of the @entity4 and is launched exactly 25 years after the original made its debut at the @entity88 in 1989			0
expect a price tag of around £ 100,000 when it goes on sale this summer			0
@entity91 has chosen a name for its forthcoming luxury 4x4 — the @entity94			0
the unusual monicker is taken from the @entity94 , a dramatic and rugged landscape on the island of @entity98			0
it 's already been spied in disguise out on test ahead of its official unveiling later this year and going on sale in 2016			2
there 's also video of it under light disguise storming around on sand dunes like @entity109			2
@entity110 off - roader has also been mooted by the @entity113 - based firm , which has a target of pushing production to 20,000 cars by 2020			2
small cars are some of the worst performers when it comes to meeting their official miles per gallon fuel efficiency figures — with the 2013 @entity123 the worst offender , a new study concludes			0
by contrast , large cars , sometimes dubbed ' gas guzzlers ' , are more likely to meet their claimed efficiency ratings			0
the findings have been published by consumer motoring website @entity130			0
its study of more than 60,000 cars concluded that the 2013 note misses its official @entity34 drive cycle fuel - economy rating of 74.72 mph by nearly a third ( 32.3 per cent ) , managing 50.5mpg in the real world			2
@entity139 is the 2014 @entity140 — out by 32 per cent on its claimed 68mpg			0
joint third from bottom are the 2012 @entity145 and 2013 @entity146			0
both miss their claimed averages by 29.2 per cent			0
the best - selling car of 2014 , the 2013 @entity149 , is the fifth worst performer , falling 28.9 per cent short of its claimed economy figure of 67.57mpg			1
by contrast the classic @entity155 from 1984 onwards is the best performing car by exceeding its claim , achieving 106.3 per cent of its official fuel economy ( 26.58mpg )			2
on average , cars now achieve 86 per cent of their official mpg figures — but this is decreasing by 1 percentage point every year @entity165 , managing editor of @entity130 , said : ' it 's no secret car buyers are confused by official fuel economy figures			1
' i 've always had a soft - spot for @entity171 , ever since i saw @entity173 's spider in @entity174 , though i could n't quite stretch to one as an impoverished cub reporter			1
now the sporty @entity177 car company has lifted the lid on its new two - seater soft - top 4c @entity172			1
it 's the wind - in - the - hair sibling of the existing 4c coupe			1
the wraps came off at this week 's @entity5			2
to keep the weight down it has an all - fabric roof which has to be stowed manually behind the seats rather than electronically			2
even the windscreen is 10 per cent thinner			0
the new two - seater soft - top 4c @entity172 is expected to go on sale in the summer priced at around £ 50,000 it comes in seven exterior colours , including the vibrant @entity191 yellow shown here , with matching stitching for the seats , steering wheel and doors , and six inside trim options			2
the new @entity171 is expected to go on sale in summer priced around £ 50,000 and will be powered by a 1.75 litre , four - cylinder engine which will propel it from rest to 60 mph in around 4.1 seconds with the 237 bhp of pulling power for a top speed of around 160 mph			1
@entity171 says it combines ' scintillating performance with open - top thrills and the unmistakable soundtrack of an @entity177 , performance - tuned engine and exhaust '			0
that 's helped by an all - new , titanium exhaust system mounted centrally , which can be tuned according to the driver 's mood			1
the dramatic ultra-lightweight single - cell or monocoque chassis is made of carbon fibre layers that together are three - times stronger and seven - times lighter than steel			0
the bodywork is made entirely from ' sheet moulded compound ' — or @entity218 — a lowdensity , high - strength composite material that is 20 per cent lighter and more rigid than steel			0
it was designed by @entity223 and will be produced at the @entity225 plant in @entity226 , @entity177			0
so from all the @entity171 males out there , here 's to you , mrs @entity230 .			0
