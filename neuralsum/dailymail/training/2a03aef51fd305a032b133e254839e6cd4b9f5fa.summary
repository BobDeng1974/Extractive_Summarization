the journalist ’s body is then shown lying on its back in a pool of blood the gruesome video of @entity7 ’s murder was almost identical to the clip of @entity10 ’s killing released exactly a fortnight ago			1
both @entity12 journalists were clad in orange overalls , forced to kneel with their hands cuffed behind their backs and then beheaded on a barren , dusty hillside by the left - handed masked killer			1
the horrific but slickly - produced film of mr @entity7 ’s appalling last moments at the hands of the hooded @entity22 fanatic was uploaded to the internet yesterday evening			1
mr @entity10 ’s video also started with footage of the president before cutting to the scene of him kneeling before his murderer			1
mr @entity7 ’s video cuts to what it calls a second message to @entity12 , subtitled in @entity38 , which depicts the 31 - year - old and his killer reading pre-scripted statements blaming his impending death on @entity12 foreign policy			1
the killer then stands behind mr @entity7 and appears to attack him with a knife			1
as the murderer slashes at the captive ’s neck , the film again fades to black			0
seconds later , the journalist ’s body is shown lying on its back in a pool of blood , his severed head placed on his stomach			1
the footage follows exactly the same format as mr @entity10 ’s murder			2
both mr @entity7 and mr @entity10 appear to have been killed by the same man : a @entity62 fighter who has been dubbed ' @entity63 ' the second film ends with a chilling final image : a captured @entity62 citizen being grabbed by the scruff of his orange overalls in what appears to be the same location			1
the threat is obvious – he will be the next person killed			0
two weeks ago , it was mr @entity7 who appeared after mr @entity10 ’s beheading			1
both mr @entity7 and mr @entity10 appear to have been killed by the same man : a @entity62 fighter who has been dubbed ‘ @entity63 ’			1
he is one of four @entity62 fighting with @entity74 who were known as ‘ @entity75 ’ because of their accents			0
their executions were both filmed in what appears to be a hilly area with a blustery wind blowing			0
however , in mr @entity10 ’s video there is a green plain in the distance below the hills and he knelt close to a dusty track			1
this information led computer experts to pinpoint the exact location of the killing in the uplands south of @entity74 ’s self - declared capital of @entity94 , north - west @entity96 jihadists , noted for their use of 21st century technology and social media , appear to have noticed this			0
mr @entity7 ’s video is filmed against a bleaker background , with far fewer geographical features – just a ridge in the background – to identify where it was shot			1
although it is impossible to say when the clip of mr @entity7 was recorded , it shows him with a small beard and some hair on his head			2
this differs from the film showing mr @entity10 ’s death , in which he was shaven - headed and clean shaven			2
this indicates that the videos were made at different times			0
it also contradicts some @entity124 intelligence officials who suggested the men may have been murdered on the same day and the propaganda videos spaced out to generate more publicity			0
mr @entity7 – a freelancer for @entity128 among other publications – is dressed in an outfit designed to mirror those worn by detainees at @entity133			2
next to him stands the extremist dressed in black hood and robes , a smart pair of desert boots , a leather shoulder holster and clutching a knife in his left hand – exactly the same clothes and weapons as in mr @entity10 ’s video			1
kneeling , the journalist reads his final statement with remarkable fortitude			0
a second message to @entity12 : taunting @entity28 : @entity7 's masked executioner tells the camera that the killing is in retaliation for @entity12 airstrikes in @entity154 ' i am @entity156			2
' i ’m sure you know exactly who i am by now and why i am appearing before you			0
' and now this is the time for my message : ' @entity28 , your foreign policy of intervention in @entity154 was supposed to be the preservation of @entity12 lives and interests , so why is that i am paying the price of your interference with my life ? ' am i not an @entity12 citizen ? ' we ’ve spent billions of @entity12 taxpayer dollars and we ’ve lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the @entity22 , so what are the people ’s interests in reigniting war ? ' from what little i know about foreign policy , i remember a time when you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back from @entity154 and @entity184 and to close down @entity133			2
' here you are now , @entity28 , nearing the end of your term , and having achieved none of the above and deceivingly marching us the @entity12 people in the blazing fire			0
' brandishing the knife as he rants on the video , the murderer approaches mr @entity7 from behind and snatches him by the chin			1
his knife apparently slashes across the victim ’s neck although – just like the @entity10 video – there is no sign of blood			2
even though the shot lasts only seconds , the captive remains kneeling upright until his left leg shoots forward and he slumps			0
again , the video then fades to black			0
the deeply disturbing film does not show the actual moment of mr @entity7 ’s decapitation – marking it out from earlier , less sophisticated , predecessors such as the slaying of @entity62 engineer @entity213 in 2004			1
after a few moments , the film returns to show the sickening sight of mr @entity7 ’s body lying in the dust			1
it then cuts to the image of the third captive , who is set to be the next beheading victim			0
again , this follows exactly the same pattern as mr @entity10 ’s video			2
the makers of the clips used multiple cameras , and professional microphones for polished production techniques – in stark contrast to earlier beheading videos circulated via the internet , which used grainy and chaotic camcorder footage			0
they also used graphics and visual effects , plus editing tools to cut film of mr @entity7 with video of @entity28 ’s press conference			1
the quality of the videos is unsurprising : @entity74 boasts an estimated 2,000 recruits from @entity244 , many of whom are well - educated , with backgrounds in it or film production			0
executioner : ' i ’m back @entity28 , and i ’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the @entity255 state , because of your insistence on continuing your bombings and … on @entity258 , despite our serious warnings			0
' @entity261 , have but to gain from your actions but another @entity12 citizen			0
' so just as your missiles continue to strike our people , our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people			0
' we take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of @entity12 against the @entity22 to back off and leave our people alone '			2
