@entity0 has grown used to being woken up at 4am by a crew member			1
that 's because it 's at that time that rowdy guests , exhausted from a night of partying at whichever port the yacht has docked at for the night , roll back on board ready for some late night sustenance			1
for the @entity11 superyacht chef , who has @entity13 - star experience both on land and at sea , it 's suddenly all hands on deck			1
' i have to be quick			2
there 's not a lot of notice so you have to move fast and you ca n't be sleepy			2
i usually get the coffee out first which buys me some time to cook whatever they need			2
whatever the request , so long as i have the ingredients , i will make it			1

chef @entity0 , 42 , is head chef of the @entity31 ( ancient @entity58 roughly meaning ' to think worthy ' ) , a 236ft yacht that sleeps 12 and has its own gym , steam and massage room			1
there is even an elevator that whizzes you from the infinity pool on the main deck to the top deck jacuzzi and bar , and everywhere in between			0
and if you grow weary of the passing landscape , there 's a 3d cinema			1
an elevator on board whizzes you from the infinity pool on the main deck to the top deck jacuzzi and bar and everywhere in between biggest perks of the job , he says , is the incredible locations he visits and being called to the main table after dinner and applauded for his food to charter the @entity31 for the week guests will need to find £ 390 , 000 ( € 525,000 ) , which means @entity87 's clients are a pretty exclusive bunch the head chef says : ' for me , it 's about the challenge			1
every day a guest might have a different request ' to charter the @entity31 for a week guests will need to find £ 390 , 000 ( € 525,000 / $ 600,000 ) , which means @entity87 's clients are a pretty exclusive bunch			1
@entity97 ranges from oligarchs and celebrities to high level business owners and developers			0
luckily , chef @entity0 is not the kind of man to be intimidate			1
' for me , it 's about the challenge			0
every day a guest might have a different request			0
' i ca n't plan ahead as the menu is so tailored to the fresh ingredients that are available at each island			0
i might have a rough idea in my head what i 'm going to make but you have to be flexible			1
i go shopping at local markets for fresh meat and fish every day if i can			0
' @entity122 cinema : clientele on the @entity31 range from oligarchs and celebrities to high level business owners and developers if guests go out partying ( a frequent occurrence at the right port ) the chef is on standby for their return for 4am feasts of beef fillet that means he has to have a vast knowledge of food as the yacht can be chartered anywhere in the world from the @entity141 to the @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			1
on top of that @entity0 has to be ready to fulfill special requests from guests including everything from £ 1,100 ( € 1,500 / $ 1,700 ) @entity150 , slabs of @entity152 ( @entity154 beef known for its deliciously marbled fat ) and jamón ibérico ( fine @entity158 cured ham )			1
' ideally if they want something unusual they order it in advance of the trip so i can order things in time			2
that does n't always happen , in which case i get on the phone to a supplier and fly ingredients over , then courier them to the yacht			2
' if he 's served any famous names , he 's not saying : discretion is paramount for all staff working on board and it 's more than his salary 's worth to let slip anything too salacious ( about £ 66,000 / $ 101,000 a year for a top chef , for those who are interested )			1
special requests include @entity150 caviar , slabs of @entity152 ( @entity154 beef known for its marbled fat ) and @entity158 jamón ibérico there is a fully functioning gym on board and 22 crew on the @entity31 , one of which is a sous chef who accompanies @entity0 in the kitchen there are 22 crew on the @entity31 , one of which is a sous chef who accompanies @entity0 in the kitchen			1
midnight feasts aside , both wake up at about 6am to start breakfast ; normally it 's a full @entity49 but often a continental breakfast is preferred			2
the galley kitchen is a fairly cramped affair but one that 's become second nature after 13 years cooking on the high seas			1
' i can spend up to 14 hours a day in the kitchen , prepping food , devising menus cooking and serving breakfast , lunch and dinner			2
the long hours are probably the toughest part			0
' although travelling around the world and seeing myriad different countries , cultures and cuisines more than makes up for it , and is one of the biggest undeniable perks of the job			0
it also means that rather than store ingredients for days on end he can buy everything - within reason - fresh			0
red snapper and sea bream are firm favourites on board			2
' i love to cook fresh fish , nothing is better to work with or has such a lovely texture			0
my specialities are salt - crusted sea bass and moules mariniere , which sounds simple but when they are that fresh they are exceptional			0
' chef @entity0 uses gold leaf to decorate plates ( left ) and does n't regret moving from dry land to cooking on a yacht for one second the @entity31 has 22 crew , one of which is a sous chef who accompanies @entity0 in the galley kitchen which is about four metres long what can be homemade on board is , including everything from five type of foie gras to vanilla ice cream , so it takes a deft hand and calm countenance to see each week through			1
' before working on yachts i spent 20 years cooking in restaurants			1
the technique is very different			0
' here , space is far more restricted – the kitchen is only four metres long with a long counter running along each side – so i have to plan carefully			0
i fry what i can to leave space in the oven for only what 's necessary			0
' what can be homemade on board is , including everything from five type of foie gras to vanilla ice cream he can organise a five - course meal on any stretch of beach large enough to swing a red snapper and is constantly amazed at the dishes guests request			1
' one family asked me to cook a cassoulet			0
it 's a simple enough @entity11 dish of wild beans and sausage but we were in almost 40 degree baking heat			1
that was pretty unusual but i was happy to do it for them			2
usually people ask for light @entity142 style dishes which impact the stomach a little less			0
' they are in swimwear after all			0
he can organise a five course meal on any stretch of beach large enough to swing a red snapper and is amazed at the dishes guests request but , for @entity0 , the best moment comes at the end of every day			1
' when guests call you up from the kitchen to the front of the table to say thank you for such a delicious supper , it 's a wonderful feeling			2
it makes the long days more than worth it			0
