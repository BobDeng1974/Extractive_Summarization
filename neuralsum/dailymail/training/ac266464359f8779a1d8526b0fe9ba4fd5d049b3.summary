retired teacher @entity0 was insulted by his headmaster @entity1 in a school newsletter as retirement announcements go , it seemed kind and innocuous enough			1
but a prep school headmaster 's wordplay has cost him his job after his departing colleague detected a stronger sentiment between the lines			0
' it is with mixed feelings that i announce the retirement of mr @entity0 at the end of this term , ' wrote @entity1 , the head of the £ 13,000 - a - year @entity17 in @entity18 , north - west @entity19			1
' we all now know every really great teacher has to finish one day and mr @entity0 will do so at the end of this term			2
' mr @entity0 , 64 , a teacher of @entity23 and @entity24 , spotted that the first letter of the first six words of the second sentence spelled out a rather uncomplimentary term			1
now mr @entity1 , 50 , has been replaced in the head 's chair after governors were unimpressed by his efforts , which formed an acrostic , reports the @entity34			1
the online edition of the newsletter was quickly updated with a reworded version to say : ' every really great teacher has to finish one day and mr @entity0 will do so at the end of this term			1
' but the original version of the october half term newsletter is still available on the school 's website for all to see			2
mr @entity0 's staff biographies remain on the school 's site , where he is described as an ' outstanding ' teacher and ' inspirational @entity46 , encouraging and promoting the enjoyment of literature across the school			1
' today , his wife @entity50 answered the door at their home in @entity18 and said she and her husband did not wish to comment on the affair			0
at hometime today parents picking up their children at the school expressed surprise and disappointment at the message			0
none of those questioned had heard of tensions between mr @entity1 and mr @entity0 , and none had noticed the hidden message until the rumours started in in the wake of the head 's departure			1
one parent , who did not wish to give her name , said : ' it 's very unprofessional			0
' you expect better from someone running a school where we 're paying a fortune for the children not to learn these words			0
@entity17 teacher @entity0 spotted that the first letters of the first six words in the second sentence of his retirement announcement spelled out a rather choice insult ' i would like to know the full story , but if he had to leave because of this then i think it 's absolutely fair			1
' another man waiting to pick up his child said : ' we got an email telling us about the resignation - we were just told he had resigned			0
we started getting texts from other parents talking about what was going on			0
' a lot of us were angry and annoyed because mr @entity1 was well - liked , respected and well thought - of			2
this goes against that character if that is what happened			0
' it 's a fee - paying school , and this sort of thing is n't what you 'd expect			2
' if you have spent £ 12 - 13,000 a year to educate your kids then you want to have confidence in their school			2
' part of me feels sorry for mr @entity1 , but if you 're the head of a private prep school you do n't do that kind of thing - you ca n't excuse something like that			1
' the school 's bursar , @entity123 , told @entity124 this morning : ' it 's an internal matter for the school , being dealt with by the governors , ' but would not comment further			0
@entity1 has now left the £ 13,000 - a - year @entity17 in @entity18 , north - west @entity19 the rude word spelled out by the acrostic was ranked as the fourth most offensive swearword in research by the @entity131 in 2000			1
its original meaning has changed over time and is mainly used as an impolite way of calling someone an ' idiot '			0
mr @entity1 , who stepped down last month after seven years in the top job , was previously in charge of the independent @entity140 in @entity141 and was deputy headteacher of @entity144 prep school in @entity145 , according to his @entity147 profile			2
@entity149 's former pupils include television presenter @entity150 and author @entity151 , who once told the @entity152 that the school was ' a hellhole of the very first order ' during his time there .			0
