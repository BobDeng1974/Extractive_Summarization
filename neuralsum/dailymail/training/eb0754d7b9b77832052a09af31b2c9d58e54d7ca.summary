we have always shown over the years that @entity3 are going to battle like mad right until the end			2
' there have been a few games where we have been behind right until the end but have kept going			0
' comeback : @entity21 scored right at the death to secure a late equaliser for @entity3 at @entity9 all the pre-match talk had been about a possible venture into the transfer market for a defensive midfielder , but based on the evidence of this match , @entity3 are more in need of a top - class striker			1
@entity70 endured a torrid first half against experienced centre - back pairing @entity72 and @entity73			2

' he is a good young guy with a massive amount of potential , ' the @entity118 told @entity1			0
' i have even noticed a difference from last season and that is only going to continue over the coming years so i am sure when he gets to his mid-twenties , he will be one of @entity117 's best strikers			0
' many were surprised when @entity129 allowed @entity97 to sign for @entity7 on a permanent basis after he scored 15 league goals on loan at the @entity134 club last year			2
