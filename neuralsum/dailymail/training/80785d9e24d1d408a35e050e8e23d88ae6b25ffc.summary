@entity2 's @entity1 story on the real reasons behind @entity5 's sacking by @entity6 @entity7 has admitted the @entity8 should have handled the fallout surrounding @entity5 ’s sacking better than they did – but insisted it was the right decision			1
speaking for the first time since the confidentiality agreement between @entity5 and the @entity8 ended in october , @entity7 played down @entity5 ’s claims of dressing - room bullying , and said his ‘ only driving force is what ’s best for @entity20 cricket ’			1
pushed to explain why the @entity8 had sacked @entity5 – who was released on monday by his @entity23 franchise @entity22 – following the @entity24 whitewash almost a year ago , @entity6 ’s managing director said : ‘ all one has to do is read @entity5 ’s book to see how disaffected he was			1
@entity7 says the right decision was made regarding @entity5 but it should have been dealt with a lot better by the @entity8 @entity5 heavily criticised former team - mate @entity28 in his autobiography ‘ i do n’t think you ’ll ever be able to explain to some people ’s satisfaction what happened			1
i can repeat what we said at the time , which was that people felt @entity5 had become disengaged from the side , and that we needed more from our leaders			1
‘ i ’m sure we could have handled it better			2
we ca n’t change it any more			2
my only driving force here is what ’s best for @entity20 cricket			1
am i content that we made the right decision ? absolutely			1
’ the @entity8 hierarchy have come under fierce criticism in some quarters for their failure to comment on some of @entity5 ’s claims in his incendiary autobiography – not least the suggestion that there was a culture of bullying within the dressing - room			1
@entity7 said : ‘ you can go on denying all sorts of things			1
the reality was that there is no formal complaint of bullying on anyone ’s record during that whole period			0
‘ we all know it was a surprise in terms of how @entity5 portrayed that environment			2
none of the other players recognise it			0
‘ i ’m passionate about @entity20 cricket going forward			1
i can not see any reason to be going over old ground , because it ’s not relevant any more			0
i ’m sure i made mistakes at the time , but it is what it is			2
’ @entity5 did n't hold back in his autobiography , with many controversial comments made throughout @entity7 drew on the positives @entity20 cricket has made since the @entity24 debacle earlier this year meanwhile , @entity7 stressed the positive gains @entity20 cricket had made since the @entity24 car - crash , and said he would be ‘ very surprised ’ if @entity86 were not confirmed as @entity6 ’s captain for the @entity88 at friday ’s selection meeting			1
though he does n’t have a say on team matters , @entity7 revealed that @entity86 ’s one - day leadership had been approved only after a week of ‘ kicking the tyres ’ by the selectors in september , but said he thought @entity86 remained the right man to lead @entity6 at the @entity88			2
‘ he ’s having a terrible time at the moment , ’ he said			0
‘ no one knows that more than him			0
but we are playing a @entity88 in @entity101 and @entity102 with two new balls , where his track record is good , and he ’s been captain for three and a half years			2
‘ the only time he really had a full - strength side , they got to the final of the @entity109 and frankly should have won it			0
yes , he ’s in miserable form , but form can change			0
‘ and just as we saw during the summer , when frankly @entity113 was going to be the next captain for @entity6 , we felt strongly that all his experience , all his toughness would come out			0
‘ the fact is he ’s a remarkably strong guy			0
his track record says he will score runs			0
everybody goes through a bad period			0
but i ’ve got to think that his form ’s got to turn			0

@entity7 says the @entity8 did n't deal with @entity5 's sacking in the correct manner
however , @entity7 says the correct decision was made in the end
he believes good *progress* has been made in @entity20 cricket since
