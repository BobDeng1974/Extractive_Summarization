by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 13 september 2012 this is definitely not the beach you want to throw your towel down on â€¦ as it 's covered with hundreds of thousands of migrating hermit crabs			1
every year on the tiny isle of @entity8 in the @entity9 a bizarre phenomenon occurs when hundreds of thousands of hermit crabs , also known as soldier crabs , make the treacherous journey towards the @entity14 all travel en - mass at the same time to reach the water where they breed			1
the female crabs then cast their fertilised eggs into the @entity20 before retreating back into the vegetation			2
on the march : millions of hermit crabs - also known as soldier crabs - head for the shoreline on the tiny @entity27 @entity26 of @entity8 the newly born hermit crabs spend several months in the sea before returning to the @entity31 crabs are predominantly a land creature , often burrowing into the roots of large trees , but must stay relatively close to the sea as they require a supply of water in their shells			1
the sea is also a perfect breeding ground for the crabs , who release millions of offspring into the waters			2
photographer and cinematographer @entity47 , 53 , from @entity49 in the @entity27 , captured the spectacle with his camera at @entity52 in the south east of the island after a tip - off from a friend			2
he said : ' i received an urgent telephone call from my good friend @entity59			0
' she was terribly excited about an event that was happening before her eyes			0
she told me it was a migration of soldier crabs also called hermit crabs and there were millions and millions of them , she likened it to the migrations of @entity71			1
'' i did n't need to hear anymore , i loaded my car with cameras and was out the door			0
@entity77 army : the rocky shoreline is carpeted with the hermit crabs , which travel to the water en masse to breed once a year mating season : the hermit crabs breed in the water , and the female crabs cast their fertilised eggs into the sea before retreating incredibly , the entire crab migration takes just one day , with the crabs heading down to the seafront at sunrise , laying their eggs before retreating back up inland into the hills at noon			1
' when i first arrived at the beach , the sight of that many crabs was astonishing , ' mr @entity47 said			0
' it was hard to fathom and once i set up a camera for a wide shot , i had to try to settle myself down and be sure that i would get all the shots that i needed			0
'' picking my way through the mass of crabs was difficult and time consuming			0
i would pick a spot on the beach rocks , close to the action that i wanted to film and i would crouch , kneel or lay down in order to get the shots			0
' during that time , crabs would crawl over my feet , hands , arms and legs and none of them were interested in pinching			0
' the photographer plans to study the crabs ' incredible migratory patterns next year when the phenomenon takes place again in august			1
