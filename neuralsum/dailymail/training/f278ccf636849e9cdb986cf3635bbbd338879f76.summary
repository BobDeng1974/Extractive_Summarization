by @entity0 for @entity1 two @entity3 sisters who survived 18 hours in the @entity4 after the tour boat they were travelling on sank in rough seas have told how they chose not to join their fellow survivors in drinking urine and eating leaves to stay alive			1
backpackers @entity11 , 21 , and her 19 - year - old sister @entity12 , managed to sit on the overturned semi-submerged hull of the stricken vessel for ten hours after it got into difficulty off the island of @entity18			1
however , after realising their chances of being rescued were becoming slimmer by the minute , they had no option but to join eight fellow survivors in swimming to an island on the horizon – a journey which took them eight hours			1
the group were eventually rescued by fishermen and all were given food and water before being flown to @entity47			2
the rescue , along with an earlier rescue of 15 others , means 23 of the 25 people on board the rickety vessel have been saved from the disaster			1
a search is ongoing for two @entity57 men who remain missing at sea after separating from the group when the boat capsized			2
when back on the mainland , the girls were quick to send a string of emails to their mother @entity65 and her husband @entity66 to let them know they were safe and well			0
in one they wrote : ' they have found everyone now			0
the boat sank in the middle of the night			1
' we sat on its roof while it was semi-submerged for ten hours			1
then swam eight hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and getting them to pick us up			1
' ' n.b no urine was drunk and no leaves were eaten , at least not by us			1
' @entity27 ( right ) has spent the last five months travelling the world on a gap year while her sister @entity11 ( right ) is a @entity85 student who joined her sister about a month ago in @entity87 for a stint of backpacking @entity12 , 19 , said in an email to her parents this week that the sisters would return back to the @entity3 at the weekend @entity11 ( pictured on a previous trip ) flew out to join her sister after completing a summer course in @entity95 these are the emails sent from @entity11 and @entity27 to their parents following the ordeal at the weekend			1
in case the embassy have n't contacted yet , we were involved in the @entity87 boat sinking but are fine having swum to shore			1
the @entity3 embassy in @entity105 are helping us			0
will contact you when we can			0
@entity11 and @entity27 monday 18/08/2014 from @entity11 they have found everyone now , such a relief			1
to sum up what happened because the press are wrong , the boat sank in the middle of the night , we sat on its roof while it was semi submerged for 10 hours , then swam for 8 hours to the shore before seeing the lights of some fishermen and getting them to pick us up			1
spent the night on an uninhabited active volcanic island with the fishermen who gave us food and water before we were taken back to a larger island			2
monday 18/08/14 from @entity27 i do n't know if you 've heard already , but everyone from the boat has now been found and is safe on @entity130			2
we went to the @entity131 ( they even picked us up from the airport ! ) to sort out some things , and we have to go to the @entity134 tomorrow to check our passports are still working after getting wet			0
they were really helpful there and told us they 'd follow up on the situation			0
we 're still planning to stay in @entity87 until our original flights home , since it 's not possible to change them , but i think some downtime will be appreciated anyway			2
their mother @entity65 , from @entity147 , @entity148 , today told how relieved she was that they managed to survive the ordeal , which occurred overnight on saturday as the tour boat was travelling to @entity152 – a popular destination with tourists due to its @entity152 dragons			1
she said : ' they are only adequate swimmers , but they had life jackets on			0
' i am very happy that they have been rescued and we are expecting to see them again in about a week 's time			2
' in fact , mrs @entity11 , from @entity147 , @entity148 , said the first she heard of the disaster was when she received the emails from her daughters			1
she said : ' i 'm glad i did n't know about it beforehand			0
it means i did n't have time to worry			0
' the girls are fine but a little sunburnt			0
they have limited access to email , so we have not been able to get the full story			0
it is thought @entity11 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) had been joined by their cousin @entity174 ( centre ) on the trip @entity11 ( pictured on a previous trip ) and her sister swam for eight hours to a volcanic island after the boat sank in rough seas on saturday			1
they were later rescued by a passing fisherman who saw their lifejackets ' the girls had a lovely time climbing the @entity189 volcano on @entity18 , and were on their way to see the @entity152 dragon when the incident happened			1
' they are fine , carrying on with their travels and they will be home on the weekend			0
i 'm looking forward to seeing them both and hearing all about it			0
' she also said that both daughters were concerned there had been insufficient safety measures on the boat and now want to help rally for improved safety			2
' they are both eager that the @entity87 government should take action to improve safety for passengers travelling on boats like theirs , ' she added			0
' they said there was n't even a radio on board			0
' the other rescued passengers included five @entity216 , four @entity217 , three @entity218 , two each from @entity57 and @entity219 , and one each from @entity221 and @entity3			2
