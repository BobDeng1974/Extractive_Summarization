by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:41 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 13:21 est , 30 october 2013 maths : @entity3 , chief executive of @entity4 , said he had not ' done the arithmetic ' on what impact green levies make on bills energy bills will still rise even if the government cuts green levies , one of the country ’s biggest power firms admitted today			1
@entity3 , chief executive of @entity4 , signalled that his firm will join the other four big energy firms in pushing up prices before the winter hits			1
yesterday he compared environment charges on bills to a ' stealth poll tax ' pushing up prices for everyone			1
but today he admitted that he did not actually know what their impact was and had not ‘ done the arithmetic ’ on how much they actually added to bills			2
mps last night tore into the @entity31 energy companies , accusing them of ' abuse ' by driving up prices , which means families across @entity35 struggle to afford to heat their homes			1
they accused the firms of giving ' meaningless ' statements as they sought to blame variously increased transport costs , green energy schemes and investment in new power stations for their decision to hike bills			1
mr @entity3 was the only senior executive to appear , with the other firms sending junior managers or pr men			1
four of the @entity31 firms have already announced big price rises , with @entity52 bills going up by 9 per cent , @entity48 announced a 10.4 per cent price hike , @entity56 a 9.2 per cent rise and @entity54 an 8.2 per cent increase			1
today mr @entity3 stepped up his criticism of environment measures , which the government demands are funded through bills			1
but he refused to rule out price rises in the coming weeks , saying on @entity63 : ‘ our prices have not yet gone up , we have n’t announced anything			1
‘ we continue to keep it under review			0
we will keep any price rises as low as possible for as long as possible			2
‘ fundamentally things in the energy mix keep driving costs up			1
' the price hikes will add £ 50 to every family 's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £ 100 the cost of going green the @entity31 energy firms are ripping off customers and acting ' like a cartel ' , the boss of a smaller competitor has claimed			1
@entity86 's @entity85 said energy companies had been taking advantage of consumers since the utilities were privatised and the market is ' dysfunctional '			1
mr @entity85 said wholesale costs alone could not justify the increase in bills			1
he told @entity63 's today programme : ' they have cited three factors : the rising cost of wholesale fossil fuels , @entity100 levies and the cost of distribution			2
' all three of those are valid , in the case of wholesale price rises right now , if you look back over 12 months , then they are not justified in raising their retail prices because of wholesale movements in this year			1
' we had a close look at that and therefore announced our own price freeze			2
' mr @entity85 added : ' i do n't think you need an inquiry to tell you this market is dysfunctional , you just have to look at it			2
six big players have a 95 per cent market share and they seem to operate like a cartel , the prices go up in conjunction			1
' mr @entity3 again complained about social costs , environmental obligations and the upgrading of networks as reasons for companies continuing to put prices up			1
he said : ‘ if you take those [ green taxes ] off then pound for pound we will take off those costs			2
’ but when pushed on how much those costs are , mr @entity3 said he had not got the exact figures to hand			1
‘ i have n’t done the arithmetic to see what the total picture is but what we would say is pound for pound we would take those costs off			2
’ @entity144 has promised to ‘ roll back ’ green levies on bills , with the government expected to fund insulation programmes and help for elderly people to keep warm through general taxation			1
mr @entity3 added : ‘ there are many more discussions to be had with the government to remove these [ green taxes ] from the bill and make them as efficient as possible			1
’ companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £ 60 if the green taxes were scrapped			2
mr @entity3 told @entity160 yesterday that green levies acted as a ' regressive stealth tax essentially ' and should be paid for from general taxation and not imposed on energy bills			1
@entity164 , chief executive officer of @entity52 , revealed the firm 's planned rise of 8.6 per cent had triggered a furious response from customers			2
he told mps : ' we immediately got customers calling us worrying about their bills after our price rise last week			0
' we had 60,000 customers call us almost straight away with worries about their bills			0
' but during the hearing in @entity178 yesterday , @entity176 mp @entity175 warned that ' thousands ' of people were dying of hypothermia because they could not afford to pay their bills			0
he said customers who fell into debt were being moved onto pre-payment meters which effectively forced them to ' self - disconnect ' because they could not afford to buy any credits			0
@entity176 mp @entity186 highlighted reports that more than three million elderly people feared that they would not be able to keep themselves warm during the winter			0
' the report also said that 24,000 people could die because of the hikes in energy prices from yourcompanies			0
' it is an absolute outrage that that is being allowed to happen in one of the richest economies in the world			0
it is an absolute abuse from the big six energy companies , ' he added			0
soaring profits : this graph shows how energy firms have seen their profits soar as bills go up			2
the wholesale energy cost has remained relatively stable @entity210 analysis shows that the average bill stood at £ 1,320 this month , up £ 70 or 5.6 per cent on the same month last year			0
wholesale energy costs – which make up the singled biggest part of the bill - have barely changed , up just 1.67 per cent or £ 10 in a year			2
@entity215 , operating and other costs make up £ 1,255 of the bill , up £ 40 or 3.29 per cent			0
however the biggest increase is the average net profit margin made on bills , up 111 per cent from £ 45 in 2012 to £ 95 now			0
