@entity0 will delay his start to the @entity3 season in order to improve his fitness after missing @entity7 ’s tour to @entity8			1
new @entity7 manager @entity9 says the striker wo n’t be in the team to face @entity12 in his side ’s opening game on august 16 , even though his partnership with @entity16 is seen as key to regaining a @entity19 spot			2
@entity20 , 31 this week , will begin his pre-season training at @entity7 ’s @entity23 complex tomorrow , having taken an extended break in the @entity25 following @entity27 ’s run to the @entity29 semi-finals			1
the @entity7 manager , speaking from the club ’s pre-season tournament camp in @entity51 , said : ‘ i ’m sure he wo n’t play in those games			2
i ’m sorry , but when you have three weeks ’ holiday you need training sessions , not a game			0
‘ everyone can criticise me but i know what you have to do with players who have had that length of holiday			2
the player himself always wants to play but the other 30 players want to play also			0
’ @entity20 has scored 48 goals in 63 starts during two seasons at @entity7 and enjoys a close relationship with @entity42 , but the former @entity27 manager substituted his star forward in the @entity29 quarter - final against @entity71 and wo n’t give him any special treatment at @entity73 , even though he is a candidate to be the club ’s captain			1
chance : @entity16 will lead the line for @entity7 when the new season kicks off stress - free : @entity20 has been enjoying his extended time off from football @entity20 missed six weeks with a knee injury towards the end of last season and @entity85 , then the @entity7 manager , was accused of working him too hard			1
after @entity7 play @entity12 , they have a relatively comfortable run of fixtures in august and september against @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , allowing @entity42 to take his time			1
the @entity95 has also won a guarantee that the club will not arrange friendlies , in which they could earn several million pounds , when other clubs are playing @entity19 fixtures this autumn			0
in discussions with executive vice-chairman @entity103 , @entity42 has asked for and received a 10 - week amnesty in which he can train with his players without the distractions of money - spinning friendlies to make up the financial shortfall caused by @entity7 ’s failure to qualify for @entity110			1
fanfare : but @entity9 did n't appreciate all the travelling in @entity8 this summer for friendlies @entity42 said : ‘ i need preparation of 10 weeks and i am lucky @entity7 are not playing in a @entity116 competition to do this			1
‘ we have discussed the issue of friendly matches and for the first 10 weeks we have to train			0
after that it is different and we will wait to see if we have a chance to play some matches			0
‘ it will also depend on the opponent			0
it has to be a good opponent like this tournament in @entity8			0
’ the compromise has been reached after @entity42 complained that @entity7 ’s 13,500 - mile pre-season tour of @entity8 had hampered his plans			2
however , it raises the prospect of them jetting abroad in december to play against other clubs who are out of @entity110 when the final group games are played in the @entity19 or when the competition returns at the knockout stage in the spring .			0

@entity20 has enjoyed extended break after @entity29 with @entity27
@entity42 has been insistent that all his players are in top shape
@entity0 will miss @entity7 friendly against @entity47 and @entity3 opener
