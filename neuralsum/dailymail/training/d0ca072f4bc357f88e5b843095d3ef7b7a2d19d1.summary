though still revered elsewhere at the corporation , the presenter was kept away from the annual fundraiser because of ‘ rumours ’ of his interest in young girls			1
sir @entity1 , the former chairman of @entity2 , said : ‘ we all recognised he was a creepy sort of character			1
we took the decision that we did n’t want him near the charity			2
’ @entity3 raised millions for good causes , so the revelation that he was barred from the @entity6 ’s own flagship appeal suggests his unsavoury lifestyle was widely known			1
sir @entity1 , 69 , who was a governor of @entity26 at the time , said : ‘ a guy with a big cigar in his mouth , a string vest who is covered in gold chains and trinkets – is this really the guy we want to become a hero for kids ? ‘ i had no evidence but i found his behaviour very strange			1
i felt it was inappropriate			0
i could n’t tell that he was a practising paedophile – but i did n’t have to			2
‘ a charity like @entity2 knew the biggest thing to guard against was paedophiles – they were just like flies around the honey pot. ’ @entity3 appeared on the telethon in 1984 , 1987 and 1989 , before sir @entity1 became chairman			1
a member of the board of governors between 1996 and 2002 , sir @entity1 said he would have stepped down from his charity role if @entity3 had become involved			1
he added : ‘ on my watch , @entity2 was properly covered			0
we did everything we could to protect the children			0
‘ not just in the fundraising but also in the distribution of funds			0
i mean , if we had given money to a paedophile group , the sky would have fallen on the @entity6			1
so we were very , very careful			0
we were on red alert			0
the charity was very attractive to paedophiles			2
i used to receive phone calls from senior police officers saying , “ do n’t go near that guy , that guy ’s a baddie ”			2
‘ we did everything we possibly could to protect the kids			0
’ the @entity75 in @entity76 is demanding an ‘ on air ’ apology during this year ’s @entity2 appeal on november 16			0

he said : ' we did n't want him near the charity ' @entity87 , chief executive of the charity , said : ‘ i will be writing to the director - general @entity88 next week , asking the @entity6 to help survivors of abuse because i think they owe it to them			1
’ since dying aged 84 a year ago yesterday , @entity3 has been exposed as one of the country ’s worst ever predatory paedophiles			1
his great - niece – who revealed her grandmother knew he had abused her but said nothing – has been attacked on @entity98 for speaking out about the tv star molesting her			2
@entity101 , 49 , of @entity102 , @entity103 , became a target for relatives after claiming her late grandmother , @entity3 ’s sister @entity100 , kept quiet to ‘ preserve his fame ’			1
she claimed to have been molested twice by the age of 15 – but after talking publicly she has been accused of lying and bringing shame on her family , which has led her to report relatives to police			1
yesterday @entity3 ’s official biographer declared herself ‘ utterly devastated ’ by his betrayal			1
@entity122 , who wrote how ’s about that , then ? said @entity3 has gone from ‘ childhood hero to monster ’ , adding : ‘ thinking back , he littered his words with phrases that i now see in a new light			1
i would laugh when he would say , unprompted , things like : “ she said she was over 16 , boss , honest			0
” ‘ maybe he felt guilty ? maybe he did n’t			0

listen to the interview here individual allegations were not collated , says mr @entity140 abuse allegations made against @entity3 while he was alive could have been linked to show ' a pattern of behaviour ' , @entity142 's commissioner said today			2
@entity140 said police and other organisations had not ' put together ' claims made against the disgraced television presenter			1
members of the public may also have been discouraged from taking action because of @entity3 's reputation at the time , he said			2
the commissioner told reporters : ' you might have thought that people would at least have talked about it and intervened			0
' it does look as if from time to time people have been concerned , they 've made the start to intervene , but probably then they 've relied a little bit too much on his reputation and his word that he did nothing			0
' if you accept all the public accounts of the activity then it 's possibly spanned 50 years which is a huge amount of time			0
' first of all within an organisation that 's got everybody 's respect , but probably it appears that people have n't intervened when they 've had suspicions			0
' then of course other organisations including the police have had individual allegations that have not been put together to actually show that this person may well have shown a pattern of behaviour that 's been pretty awful			2
' four police forces were contacted by seven potential victims while @entity3 was alive			1
@entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 all found that there was not enough evidence to proceed			0
mr @entity140 said a lot of what happened was before changes were made to the sharing of police data following the murders of @entity201 and @entity201			0
