@entity0 has devoted his life to the mysterious @entity3 martial art of @entity4			1
having learned his skills from an 80 - year - old @entity7 guru , he is now seeking an apprentice to keep the ancient art alive			1
but he insists that any budding warrior wanting to follow in his footsteps must travel to his home - in @entity13			1
poised : @entity0 is the last surviving master of @entity4 , a @entity3 martial art @entity16 is the fifth - largest organised religion in the world , with around 26million followers , most of whom originated in the @entity22 of the @entity7 sub-continent			1
it is considerably younger than any other major religion , having started with the teachings of @entity27 in the late 15th century			0
one of @entity16 's most famous features is the kirpan , a curved dagger supposed to be carried ( but rarely used ) by all proponents of the religion			0
the importance of this weapon fits the @entity3 ideal of the @entity36 or ' warrior saint '			1
all @entity3 men are given the name @entity40 , meaning ' lion '			0
the martial art of @entity4 started with the dawn of the @entity44 in the 17th century , when the new religion was under attack from neighbouring @entity47 and @entity48			2
@entity3 quickly gained a reputation for being crack warriors , particularly the @entity51 sect - @entity51 , a name now carried by many @entity3 , means ' crocodile '			2
when the @entity44 was suppressed by the @entity56 colonisers after the @entity57 in the mid- 19th century , not only was @entity4 banned , but the blue turbans which marked out @entity51 @entity59 was also prohibited			0
the 45 - year - old former factory worker is looking for someone to inherit both his unique knowledge and his armoury of amazing weapons			1
he said : ' @entity4 is a part of my history and culture and without it we lose our character			0
it has changed history and produced great warriors - for it to die out now would be a tragedy			1
' throughout the day , no matter what i am doing , @entity4 is always in my mind			0
' i am the last known remaining master - it is my mission in life now to find a successor to carry on this great martial art. if i die with it , it is all gone			1
' @entity0 conducts a rigorous daily routine , awakening at dawn to recite ancient mantras followed by seven hours of writing and study			0
after a late siesta listening to classical @entity7 music , the expert swordsman embarks on six hours of martial yoga and @entity4 , before mediation and sleep at 2am			2
the basis of @entity4 - the ' science of weapons ' - is a five - step movement : advance on the opponent , hit his flank , deflect incoming blows , take a commanding position and strike			2
it was developed by @entity3 in the 17th century when their fledgling religion was coming under attack , but it was forced underground when the @entity56 banned @entity3 from using arms after the first @entity109			0
in 1984 , @entity0 met @entity40 , the last remaining master of @entity4 , while working on his aunt 's farm in the remote village of @entity113 in the @entity7 @entity22			1
he said : ' the master was from the next village - he saw my physique and asked me if i wanted to learn @entity4			1
' he got me to attack him with a stick , but before i knew it i was on the floor			0
i thought it might be a fluke , but i did it over and over again and each time he threw me around like a rag doll			0
' i was awestruck because i was 17 and he was in his 80s			0
' i stayed for 11 years , milking the buffalos in the morning and spending the remainder of the day training with my master and learning the philosophy			2
' i then returned to @entity13 in 1995 to marry my wife @entity131			0
' when my master @entity132 died later that year , i became the last @entity3 warrior - now i am looking for someone to succeed me			1
i will teach them here in my home in the @entity137 so they will have to travel here			1
' the father - of - four warrior master sits with his fearsome array of weapons next to the telly in his @entity13 home @entity0 gave up his day - job in a food factory in 2002 to become a full - time writer and teacher of @entity4			1
he is now the ninth gurdev ( teacher ) of a school established in 1661 , called the ' @entity153 '			0
well - armed : @entity0 's collection of weapons is full of antiques which have actually been used in battle he lectures worldwide and teaches his pupils how to use swords , daggers and spears , most of which were used in historical battles			2
@entity0 said : ' ninety - five per cent of our weapons are antiques , from as far back as the 16th century - they 've all been passed down through various families			2
' the fighting is geared towards a lethal outcome , but it takes many years of training before students are allowed to handle a blade			0
' students of the martial art achieve ' master ' status , which can take decades , when they are deemed ready by living masters			1
he said : ' the current group of people who practise the martial art have all been taught by me - without my teaching , they would not know it and @entity4 would be on the brink of extinction			1
' although learning can last a lifetime , and more , i have become a master after fully committing myself to the martial art - at least 70 hours of training a week for almost 30 years			1
' my students show promise but are only at the first rung of the ladder			0
after all , they have n't been training for more than seven or eight years maximum - and that 's only for 10 to 15 hours a week			2
' to become a master of @entity4 takes decades of dedication , often as the sole student of one master			0
' devout : @entity3 accompany their holy book , far left , in a ceremony at the @entity204 in @entity7 learned : @entity0 was taught by an 80 - year - old guru in a remote @entity7 village			0

but former factory worker , 45 , says learner warrior must come to @entity137
' i am the last known remaining master - it is my mission in life now to find a successor to carry on this great martial art. if i die with it , it is all gone '
