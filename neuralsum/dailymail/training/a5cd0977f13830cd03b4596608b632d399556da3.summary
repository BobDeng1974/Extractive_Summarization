his selection on tuesday was nothing like that			0
' @entity5 needed to blast @entity6 out of the way			2
instead @entity1 left @entity33 and @entity34 on the bench			0
' it was a game he needed to win and yet he picked a midfield of @entity20 , @entity19 and @entity21 – all solid players but more than two from those three and the side feels defensive			0
@entity41 was @entity5 's only attacking threat as @entity43 ( centre ) started on the bench @entity6 secured the draw they needed to beat @entity5 to second place behind @entity49 in @entity50 ' at half - time he brought on a left - back , @entity54 , and a winger , @entity56 , who has done very little for him so far			2
' then when he did bring on @entity34 , a no 10 to his boots – he even wears the number – he played the @entity61 in central midfield			0
