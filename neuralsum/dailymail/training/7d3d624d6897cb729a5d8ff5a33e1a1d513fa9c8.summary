she might want to start paying closer attention			0
an incredible video has shown the moment a distracted female humpback failed to spot a group of whale watchers aboard a small boat off @entity8 in @entity9 - so barreled right through them			1
on the footage , which was taken by passenger @entity13 earlier this month , the group gasps when they first spot the female humpback with her calf - unaware that they 'll soon be getting a much closer view			1
suddenly , she turns towards their boat and , slapping her large pectoral fin , heads their way			0
spotted : a group of whale watchers off @entity8 in @entity9 spotted this mother humpback whale with her calf during a trip - and gasped in joy ... but she was about to get much , much closer on her way : the whale , followed by her calf , suddenly turned towards the boat and headed their way ' it 's gon na ram us , ' one passenger shouts , while others scream in shock			1
' this is so awesome ! ' says another as the whale glides beneath their 25 - foot inflatable boat			1
although the knock from the whale was n't a hard strike , it was enough to ' toss our boat a good five feet when she hit , ' @entity13 told @entity47			2
' as soon as she was done pushing us aside she dove under , then popped right back up on the other side with her calf , ' she said			0
@entity13 , who shared the video to @entity51 , explained she was taking the @entity53 trip with her husband , @entity54 , when they spotted the whales from afar			0
the crew had switched off the engines - and experts said this could be one of the reasons the mom whale did n't notice the boat			2
water sight ! with no plan of stopping - and likely distracted by her calf and a bothersome male nearby - the whale heads towards the boat as the spectators scream in joy and shock collision : the whale can be seen swimming beneath the boat , which is knocked and moved about five feet just passing through : after the collision , the whale and the calf continued as if nothing had happened but she was also likely keeping her eye on a bothersome male whale lurking nearby , said @entity84 , ceo for @entity85			1
' it is most likely that this mom was distracted with her calf and keeping another eye on a escort that was being a little irritating for the female , as escorts can be , ' @entity84 told @entity47			2
afterwards , she carried on slapping her fin ' like nothing happened ' , he said			0
it is unlikely that she was trying to warn the passengers to keep away from her calf because a whale is more likely to slap its tail fin - rather than the pectoral fin - and make noises to signal its anger			0
each year , humpback whales migrate from cool waters near @entity106 to @entity9 , where they breed , and can be seen regularly between november and may , according to the @entity108 .			1

the whale was likely distracted by her calf and a bothersome male nearby when she turned towards the boat of *tourists* and swam right through
she did no *damage* to the boat and continued as if nothing had happened
humpback whales are regularly seen in the warm waters of @entity9 over the *winter* after migrating from @entity106 to breed
