we were sailing together for 28 years and he was a true friend			2

a lifeboat turned up in about 15 minutes and it 's lucky they did because my boat and the wheelhouse broke in half			0

if that had gone we would probably have gone with it			0
@entity12 's urn was sitting on his bunk when the ship went down			1
i 'd also kept my father 's urn onboard all those years so that went too			0
' mr @entity8 said looters ' even took the figurehead - the one part i was most desperate to keep			2

the ship had been reused and lovingly restored by mr @entity8 before the accident more than 25 years later the colourful fishing boat - known as a ' pop pop ' because of the sound of its engine - had attracted a huge following			1
mr @entity8 said it was so badly damaged - and that so much had been stolen - there is no hope of repairing it			0

' it was a dream , my finest achievement			0
it would cost you at least a million pounds to do all that work from scratch			0
