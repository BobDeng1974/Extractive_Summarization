@entity0 have set a potentially dangerous precedent by ruling that the final 18 seconds of @entity5 women 's @entity3 qualifier against @entity6 will be replayed after a refereeing mistake			1
the @entity9 qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at @entity10 in @entity11 on thursday with the match resuming with @entity5 retaking a penalty in the 96th minute at 2 - 1 down			1
@entity5 's 3 - 1 group 4 victory against @entity15 on thursday afternoon means the @entity16 will qualify for the @entity3 if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2 - 2			1
@entity5 are awarded a penalty during their @entity21 qualifier in @entity11 referee @entity22 points to the spot as @entity5 are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute @entity25 steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against @entity6 @entity25 runs forward to strike the ball but team - mate @entity30 ( circled ) has entered the box @entity25 turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper 's bottom - right corner @entity36 referee @entity22 officiating a women 's @entity38 match in @entity40 last month @entity41 scored twice at the @entity42 while @entity25 , who is set to take the last minute spot - kick against @entity6 , earned some practice as she scored past @entity46 goalkeeper @entity45 from 12 - yards			1
@entity6 are second in the group following an impressive 8 - 1 win against @entity49 , but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot - kick will give @entity5 a place in the @entity53 finals in @entity54			1
the astonishing decision has been taken for the first time in a @entity0 competition following an @entity59 appeal after the referee had wrongly denied @entity5 the opportunity to retake the penalty during saturday 's match following encroachment			1
@entity5 midfielder @entity25 thought she had equalised after slotting the ball into the bottom - right corner but team - mate @entity30 had entered the box too early and @entity36 referee @entity22 disallowed the goal			1
however , instead of ordering it to be retaken , 28 - year - old @entity70 - who was named @entity71 by the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) in 2014 - wrongly awarded an indirect free - kick to @entity6			1
according to the laws of the game , a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team - mates of the player taking the kick			0
@entity5 players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against @entity6 but referee @entity22 awards an indirect free - kick and the celebrations are cut short @entity25 has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake but @entity25 then realises the referee 's decision and two @entity94 players are seen celebrating @entity36 referee @entity70 is understood to have been sent home following her error on saturday april 4 - @entity5 1 - 2 @entity6 ( match to be replayed from 96th min on april 9 at 9:45pm ) april 4 - @entity15 1 - 0 @entity49 april 6 - @entity6 2 - 0 @entity15 april 6 - @entity5 9 - 1 @entity49 april 9 - @entity15 1 - 3 @entity5 april 9 - @entity49 1 - 8 @entity6 a scene of apparent confusion followed @entity5 's wild celebrations as @entity22 explained her decision			1
@entity25 had grabbed back the ball to retake the penalty and placed it on the penalty spot before realising an indirect free - kick had been awarded			1
two @entity94 players then embraced as they celebrated the decision			0
a @entity0 statement read : ' the @entity110 has ordered the match to be replayed			2
' the replay of the match should be carried out as follows : ' the match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the @entity72 at the @entity117 's under - 19 championship 2015 match between @entity5 vs @entity6 played on april 4 , 2015 , and extended according to the discretion of the referee			1
' the penalty kick shall be retaken by the @entity72			0
' according to the @entity121 ( @entity122 14 ) , a team - mate of the player taking the kick infringes the @entity121 : - the referee allows the kick to be taken - if the ball enters the goal , the kick is retaken - if the ball does not enter the goal , the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred ' as the ball entered the goal , the kick should have been re-taken			1
thus the @entity142 ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 ( e ) and 7 ( 2 ) of the disciplinary regulations			2
@entity25 scored from the penalty spot during @entity5 's 3 - 1 victory against @entity15 on thursday @entity41 ( right ) scores with a header as @entity5 inched closer to @entity53 qualification ' the match is scheduled to take place at the @entity42 in @entity11 on thursday at 9:45pm local time with another referee			1
' @entity157 must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment			0
any of these players can take the penalty kick			0
' an @entity59 spokesperson said : ' after @entity5 women @entity165 ' match against @entity6 on saturday , april 4 , the @entity59 lodged an appeal to @entity0 following a disallowed penalty			1
' due to an incorrect application of the game 's laws by the match referee , @entity0 have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty			2
' the remainder of the match will be played on thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium â€“ @entity10 , @entity11			0
' @entity25 is congratulated by her @entity5 team - mates after scoring past @entity46 goalkeeper @entity45 former @entity181 and @entity5 captain @entity180 is head coach of the national women 's @entity3 team although it will only last 18 seconds , officials , stewards and paramedics will all be required to attend			2
@entity5 , coached by former national captain @entity180 , were 2 - 0 down to @entity6 on saturday before substitute @entity30 pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point			1
however , @entity192 's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat			0
@entity5 brushed off the disappointment on monday , though , with a 9 - 1 win against @entity49			2
both @entity5 and @entity6 must start the match with the same 11 players who finished saturday 's match			2
however , a different player can take the penalty			0
the decision further complicates the already complex qualification process for july 's finals after @entity0 had announced that @entity6 had sealed their place			2
after an initial qualifying round last year , the @entity9 is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across @entity210			0
the six group winners and best - placed runner - up - decided by the best record against the first and third - placed teams in the groups - go through to join hosts @entity54 at the showpiece event in july			0
@entity5 women 's senior head coach @entity218 tweeted : ' difficult circumstances for our @ england @entity3			0
i have been proud that in challenging circumstances you have conducted yourselves superbly & represented your country with great pride			0
' regardless of final outcome you should be very proud			0
we are very proud of you			0
' september 2005 - @entity230 qualifier - @entity228 vs @entity231 @entity228 had won the opening leg of the @entity234 zone fourth - round play - off 1 - 0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching			2
rather than retaking the penalty , an indirect free - kick was wrongly awarded by @entity242 referee @entity241 to @entity231 and the game ended with a one - goal margin			1
@entity228 called for an investigation but were left furious after @entity246 ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid			0
it proved to have a major impact as it was @entity231 who eventually went through with a 1 - 1 away goals victory , though they were later beaten in the @entity257 - @entity256 play - off			0
@entity231 staff and players celebrate after beating @entity228 in an @entity234 @entity230 qualifier in 2005			0

@entity0 have ordered the final 18 seconds of the qualifier to be replayed
@entity5 will resume the match against @entity6 from the penalty spot
the @entity9 qualifier resumes in @entity11 on thursday at 9:45pm
referee @entity22 incorrectly awarded an indirect free - kick to @entity6 for encroachment after disallowing @entity5 's penalty on saturday
@entity5 were 2 - 1 down to @entity6 at the time in the 96th minute
@entity36 @entity70 , 28 , has been sent home following her error
three lions earn 3 - 1 victory against @entity15 meaning a 2 - 2 will be enough for @entity53 qualification
@entity6 beat @entity49 8 - 1 to keep things tight in @entity283
it is the first time ever that a decision like this has been taken by @entity0
