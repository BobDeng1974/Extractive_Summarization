on the pretty streets of his neighbourhood in @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity0 would play the perfect family man , delighting locals with his easy - going charm , approachable air and the loving relationship he clearly had with his three young children			1
they had given him a new sense of purpose in life and taught him not to be so obsessive about his work , the famously dedicated actor liked to tell interviewers			0
in recent months , however , neighbours had noted a change for the worse in the oscar - winner , widely regarded as one of the finest screen actors of his generation for his performances in films such as @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			0
one said he looked a ‘ troubled soul ’			0
he was there promoting his new movie , @entity46			0
his usual scruffy appearance notwithstanding , he looked distinctly washed out and unwell			0
he turned down a string of interviews , his spokesman telling reporters ‘ he needed a minute and did n’t feel like coming down yet ’			0
@entity0 later agreed to talk on the proviso there were no personal questions			2
it was no secret he had struggled to stay free of the drugs he ’d managed to give up 23 years ago - relapsing twice in the past two years			2
but friends insist they were convinced he had it under control , seeking help every time he thought his addictions were threatening to overwhelm him			0
it emerged yesterday that @entity0 had even helped other stars , including @entity66 star @entity65 — who was found dead in 2008 after an overdose of prescription drugs — to try to break free from heroin ’s lethal appeal			1
but clearly not everyone knew that his happy family unit had been broken and that he had recently become estranged from his children ’s mother , costume designer and theatre director @entity73			1
they had been a couple since working on a play together in 1999 , but @entity0 had quietly moved out of the family home around @entity81 and was renting an apartment nearby			1
on sunday morning , the 46 - year - old actor failed to pick up their three children — @entity36 , ten , @entity38 , seven , and five - year - old @entity37 — from a nearby playground , so ms @entity73 phoned @entity0 ’s friend , screenwriter @entity87			1
@entity0 sits in a bar in @entity89 just three days before he died he in turn phoned @entity0 ’s @entity92 personal assistant , @entity91 , who unlocked the door to @entity0 ’s £ 6,000 - a - month flat and called emergency services			1
ms @entity73 was distraught when she heard the news			2
bundling her children into her car , she drove to @entity0 ’s flat , leaving them in the car outside with its engine running , as she dashed inside shouting : ‘ i have to see him ! ’ officers reportedly did n’t allow her into the bathroom where he had died			1
police said yesterday that ms @entity73 told them that @entity0 appeared to be high when she saw him on the day before he died			1
he still sounded as if he was on drugs when she talked to him again on the phone at around 8pm			0
the autopsy and coroner ’s report has yet to be released , but police are confident @entity0 died from a heroin overdose			1
inside the fourth - floor apartment , investigators found the actor lying unconscious with a syringe stuck in his left arm			1
he was wearing just a t - shirt and boxer shorts			0
he still had on his glasses , said the police , who found no signs of a struggle			0
the flat contained compelling evidence of heavy drug - taking — there were no fewer than 49 full glassines , the paper envelopes used to store heroin , as well as 20 used needles			1
there were also eight empty envelopes , most of them stamped with the logos @entity136 or @entity138 — dealers ’ identifying marks showing the ‘ brand ’ of heroin			0
in the kitchen , there were bottles of prescription pills to treat anxiety and high blood pressure			0
police did not find a suicide note , and are understood to believe the death was accidental			0
did @entity0 start to fall back into drug use before or after he split from his long - term girlfriend ? showbusiness sources have suggested it may have been the reason for their separation			1
@entity0 was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in his apartment in the @entity159 in @entity4 @entity161 insiders say @entity0 and @entity73 had been a devoted but understated showbusiness couple			1
intensely private , @entity0 , whose parents divorced when he was young , did not like to talk about his family			2
in a rare tribute to @entity73 , he collected a @entity166 for his role as @entity26 in 2006 and said : ‘ i want to say i love her and she looks really hot tonight			2
’ a few weeks later , he won an @entity169 for the same role and forgot to mention her			0
yesterday , friends said @entity0 and @entity73 had been discreet about their break - up			1
‘ whatever was going on , they kept it quiet , ’ said @entity173 , a former colleague of @entity0			2
‘ all i knew is that @entity0 was a devoted father			2
he saw the children every day			0
’ @entity178 investigators leave the actor 's apartment following investigations police gather outside the actor 's £ 6,000 - a - month apartment on sunday ms @entity173 also rejected any suggestion that @entity0 might have been in a relationship with @entity91 , saying : ‘ there was nothing romantic between them			1
@entity0 was a mentor for @entity91			2
she was learning her way in the business as a family friend			0
’ ms @entity73 and her children released a statement saying : ‘ we are devastated by the loss of our beloved @entity0 and appreciate the outpouring of love and support we have received from everyone			1
’ for now , police are trying to establish what sort of heroin @entity0 was taking			2
there is speculation that the actor , who started using the drug as a student , may have inadvertently poisoned himself with heroin laced with fentanyl , a powerful opiate given to ease pain in cancer patients			2
this dangerous concoction has recently been found in packets stamped with the @entity136 logo , such as the ones discovered in @entity0 ’s home			1
heroin contaminated with fentanyl has been blamed for the recent deaths of almost 100 heroin users in the @entity221 ‘ we do n’t yet know what killed @entity0 , but we do know there is a batch of heroin going round which is laced with fentanyl , ’ said @entity222 of the @entity223			2
its victims ‘ knew how much to inject , they knew how to be safe , ’ she said			0
‘ you do n’t realise this is a drug that is 100 times more potent than morphine			0
’ there were also reports yesterday that @entity0 may have been videotaped buying drugs the night before he died			1
he was seen looking ‘ very sweaty ’ as he withdrew large amounts of money from a local cash machine , which he handed to two men carrying messenger bags			0
to add to the picture of his chaotic state , a witness told yesterday how she had seen the actor in a bar in @entity89 , @entity249 , last thursday — drinking , smoking and repeatedly running to the lavatory to such an extent that she ’d found it suspicious			1
police have talked to @entity0 ’s assistant @entity91 , a pretty 28 - year - old brunette			1
@entity0 's personal assistant @entity256 who is thought to have found the actor dead the @entity259 graduate and granddaughter of the late @entity261 — matriarch @entity262 in @entity263 — has known @entity0 for nearly 20 years			1
they met when @entity0 , then an unknown actor , appeared in a 1996 play directed by her father , @entity267			1
best known in @entity92 for playing two - headed alien @entity269 in @entity270 , @entity267 teaches drama at a @entity4 college and has collaborated with @entity0 on several plays			1
‘ i ’m not talking to folks right now about @entity0 , ’ he said from his home in @entity3			2
friends of @entity0 had only just got over a hoax claim on the internet that he had died , which circulated just days before his actual death			1
yet a handful of them have admitted they were n’t surprised by the news of his death			0
‘ sadly , after being sober for years & years , he relapsed & has been grappling with his addiction for last few years , ’ actress @entity284 , a friend of @entity0 from college days , wrote on @entity286			1
‘ i wish i could say i was shocked , but all i feel is a mixture of terrible grief , sad resignation and a powerful rage			0
’ the actor had said that he managed to stay off drugs for 23 years , until 2012 , when he checked himself into rehab for snorting cocaine and taking prescription drugs			2
in may 2013 , he relapsed again and spent ten days in rehab			0
even worse , this time he admitted he had snorted heroin for a week			0
he credited a ‘ great group of friends and family ’ for helping him seek the treatment he needed to recover			0
but @entity0 was honest enough to admit there was no miracle cure , and that the threat of a relapse continually hung over him			2
drug taking was n’t simply ‘ just a phase ’ in his life , he confessed			0
inevitably , living on his own deprived @entity0 of the constant companions who might have prevented his final relapse			2
having a family , he had argued , encouraged him to look after himself			0
‘ when you have kids , health becomes more of a question than it ever did before , ’ he said			0
‘ you are aware of the maintenance of your life , while before you were n’t so aware of that			0
’ the double tragedy of @entity0 ’s death , it emerged yesterday , was that he had tried hard to save fellow star @entity65 and other celebrities from heroin			1
‘ @entity0 did n’t hesitate when @entity65 ’s people asked for help getting him clean , ’ a friend of @entity0 told an entertainment news website			0
‘ @entity0 spent hours talking to @entity65 , counselling and helping him , persuading him to choose life over drugs			1
‘ that ’s what is so tragic about @entity0 ’s death — he would spend all this time on others giving them reasons to stay away from drugs and to live , and yet when it came to himself it ’s as if he was spent : there was nothing left			1
