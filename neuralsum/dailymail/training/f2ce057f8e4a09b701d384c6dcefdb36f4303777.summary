when @entity6 steps out in a design it invariably sells out almost instantly			2
and now one enterprising fashion label has made the most of their association with the duchess - by reissuing a style she was seen in - and naming it the @entity6			1
@entity14 have rereleased the beige belted style just weeks after the @entity6 wore it on a public engagement			1
unsurprisingly , it is already a sell out success			0
@entity6 wore the elegant coat with tights and brown heeled ankle boots when she visited @entity3 with her husband in november last year , and it immediately sold out @entity1 - who is just weeks away from giving birth to her and prince @entity26 's first child - wore the cashmere , knee - length overcoat on a visit to @entity3 last november , garnering a storm of publicity for the brand			1
now , as a note of thanks , the label has reissued the coat and renamed it after her			0
the elegant piece , with a high neck and a bow - shaped belt , is available from the @entity42 label 's diffusion line , @entity14 @entity14 have decided to reissued the elegant coat under a new name , ' the @entity6 ' , and it has already sold out online at @entity45 the @entity6 coat costs £ 875 and is available to buy from @entity45 in the @entity47			1
it has already sold out online			0
with myriad brands cashing in on @entity6 's selling power , many have suggested that the duchess could one day endorse her own clothing line			2
indeed , last year the @entity54 of the @entity55 and @entity6 and prince @entity56 applied to the @entity57 to trademark the duchess ' royal title - so that one of her official charities could use her name on a range of goods including ' clothing , footwear and headgear '			2
the @entity45 website shows that the coat has already sold out , despite its rather hefty price tag a spokesman for @entity73 said in march : ' we have been registering our new name and logo in different territories around the world			0
' as part of that process , we have to choose any categories under which we might conceivably operate in the future			0
this also protects the foundation against other people using its name illegally			0
' we included clothing in case we choose , for example , to make t - shirts in years to come , for marathon runners , etc. ' the @entity6 in her pale blue @entity94 dress in @entity95 , the capital of @entity96 , left , which was reissued soon after she wore it eco-label @entity98 reissued the £ 540 pale blue chiffon dress @entity1 of @entity3 sported on a visit @entity96 capital @entity95 in september during a tour to the @entity104			1
but @entity98 are n't the only designers to reissue pieces in order to capitalise on the @entity108			0
the @entity110 blouse worn by @entity6 in her official engagement picture , left , and the blue ' @entity113 ' dress by @entity110 she wore at the @entity114 , right , both quickly sold out after the @entity1 was seen in them @entity6 's cream silk @entity110 blouse was relaunched after selling out when @entity6 wore it in her official engagement photo , taken by famed photographer @entity120			1
@entity121 carries a taupe version of the @entity124 bag , now named after her , the day after her sister 's wedding , left , and a faux - croc version while out shopping , right more recently , designer @entity129 reissued a blue tweed skirt suit after the @entity1 was seen wearing it at a charity event in may			1
@entity133 also re-released a blue tweed coat , part of diffusion line @entity133 , that was snapped up two years after it first hit the catwalk by the thrifty @entity1 at discount outlet @entity138			2
and it is not just @entity6 who can carry some serious fashion clout on the high street			0
her younger sister @entity121 's love of the £ 195 @entity124 grab bag caused sales of the design to explode fifty-fold .			0

@entity1 wore the cream coat on a visit to @entity3 last year
the bow - tied *classic* coat , which costs £ 875 , sold out within hours
now @entity14 have reissued the style under the name ' the @entity6 ' **...**
