@entity0 , 42 , could n't believe her luck when a dress she made from 24,000 loom bands reached the high bid of £ 170,000 after she posted it on @entity5			1
and it seems that many more wannabe weavers are eager to follow suit and make a quick buck from their rubber band creations , with the online auction site being inundated with clothing and accessories made from the bright bands			1
fashion fans have crafted everything from bikinis to belts and even high - heeled shoes from the rainbow - coloured elastic bands			0
the listing of ' thong made from the popular bands ' was originally taken down as the image broke @entity5 's nudity laws but the product has since reappeared on the site using a different image to illustrate the design			2
@entity42 , 22 , from @entity43 outside @entity44 , created the swimwear and has currently received six bids with the loomkini currently going for £ 51 , which seems rather modest compared to @entity0 's huge profit			2
the auction for the loomkini closes on friday at 3.24pm			0
even flip - flops and high heels created from the colourful bands are beginning to appear on @entity5 the shoes are n't created entirely out of the bands but instead heels are decorated using the weave jumping on the band wagon : @entity0 , 42 , put her dress , made entirely from loom bands by her friend @entity62 , on @entity5 and it reached £ 170,000 - since then the auction site has been inundated with loom band creations if the bikini sells for that price it would yield a £ 45 profit ( not factoring in the 24 hours labour it took to create )			1
for some of the weavers their creations are more than just a hobby			2
one listing advertises a bodycon boob - tube style dress that is being sold to raise funds for a big day			0
the dress was designed by @entity80 26 , from @entity81 in @entity82 , who enlisted her family to help make the dress which took them a grand total of 39 hours to create			0
too much skin : @entity42 's original advertisement showed more of his figure than @entity5 allows ( right ) but his item has since been relisted and the 22 - year - old is currently fetching bids over £ 50 @entity80 is hoping that her efforts will pay for her wedding to partner @entity96			1
according to @entity98 newspaper @entity80 is even hoping there will be enough to set aside a little extra to help buy her brother a car to thank him for helping with the dress			0
' it was my brother 's idea to make such a fashionable dress , and he helped me decide on the particular style we ended up with after we had discussed it			0
i have n't seen anything on the internet like it			0
' @entity80 is hoping that her complicated design might fetch enough to cover the cost of her wedding ... not to mention a car for her brother pick of the crop : this revealing crop top is one of the many inventive designs currently listed on the site ' i just thought that if the other lady could do it , then so can i. there 's a huge craze going on at the moment with these bands , so i gave it a go ' continued the hopeful bride - to - be			1
however it appears that the increasing availability of loom band clothing is seeing the value of the garments decrease			1
11 - year - old @entity136 from @entity137 , @entity138 , spent seven days crafting a loom band dress from 25,000 of the elastic bands			1
a family affair : @entity136 will spend her £ 45 profit on a fish and chip dinner with her folks on their next holiday @entity136 used £ 90 worth of the bands and saw her dress go under the hammer for just £ 155			1
however the school girl seemed unscathed and thanked her family for the support			0
' my family have been the greatest throughout because they gave me the £ 90 to make this dress and have supported me all the way			2
' unlike @entity80 , @entity136 has much more humble plans for her loom band profit			1
she said she wanted to raise at least £ 50 cash so she could give her four - year - old brother @entity160 £ 10 , keep £ 20 for her to spend in the arcades and £ 20 for a fish and chip dinner treat while on holiday in @entity164 , @entity165 , next month			0
getting creative : one weaver created a belt using the bands daring design : the dresses now listed on the site have become increasingly intricate to compete with the many available			0

a loom band dress reached bids of £ 170,000 on @entity5
since then many more weavers have listed their creations
one woman hopes selling a dress will cover wedding costs
however , value seems to be decreasing with *latest* dress selling for £ 155
