and then there were eight			0
the line - up for the @entity3 quarter - finals was completed on wednesday night as @entity4 and @entity5 sealed their passage and though it may be a total wipeout for the @entity10 clubs , we certainly have a high pedigree field			1
now , more than ever , it 's all about scoring goals at crucial moments as the @entity16 final on june 6 looms on the horizon			0
but which of the eight survivors is best - equipped for the challenge ? we assess the forward trios of each team			0
@entity23 was excellent for @entity4 in their last 16 defeat of @entity25 @entity26 vs @entity4 @entity27 vs @entity28 @entity29 vs @entity30 @entity5 vs @entity31 @entity4 @entity23 - absolutely mesmerising against @entity25 and we are swiftly moving into territory where @entity23 may be considered the best player of all time			1
the @entity37 maestro has 43 goals and 23 assists in 40 outings so far this season and , as ever , is central to @entity4 's hopes of another @entity3 triumph rating : @entity44 @entity47 - a real joy to watch , the 23 - year - old @entity45 just gets better and better with every passing week			1
may not be able to match @entity23 's prolific goalscoring but is just as influential when it comes to carving out chances with a moment of magic 9 @entity53 - his troubles of last summer behind him , £ 75m man @entity53 is slowly growing into the kind of player @entity4 want him to be			1
looks comfortable working in tandem with @entity23 and @entity47 , running @entity25 ragged in the first leg of the last round tie 7.5 total : 26/30 @entity25 goalkeeper @entity60 and @entity4 's @entity47 compete for the ball @entity53 tormented @entity25 in the round of 16 tie which @entity4 won 3 - 1 on aggregate @entity28 @entity66 - it 's become a season of frustrations for @entity28 , but @entity66 rises serenely above the negativity			1
with 41 goals and 21 assists in 39 appearances , his return this season has been as good as ever			0
their guiding light when @entity28 ended their long wait of the 10th @entity3 triumph last season , he is needed again now 9 @entity80 - it 's been a turbulent season for the @entity82 , who seems to have been made the @entity84 scapegoat for their shaky form post-christmas , leading to suggestions he may return to the @entity87 in the summer			2
but he has still scored 16 goals in all competitions this season 7 @entity92 overshadowed by the aforementioned @entity80 and @entity66 , the @entity91 striker just gets on with the business of scoring goals			2
he has plundered 20 in the season so far and is always capable of getting into dangerous positions 7.5 total : 23.5/30 @entity66 is , as ever , integral to @entity28 's hopes of winning the trophy @entity80 has endured a difficult season but is sure to have an influence in the latter stages @entity92 celebrates a goal for @entity28 against @entity103 in the second leg @entity5 @entity105 - the renaissance of @entity105 continued this week as his two goals in the @entity108 carried @entity5 through at the expense of @entity110 and increased his season 's tally to 23 , including six in eight in @entity113			1
his deadly finishing combined with a strong work ethic is one of the reasons @entity5 can be considered dark horses 8 @entity119 22 - year - old with plenty of maturity and promise , moving from @entity28 to @entity5 for £ 17m last summer has proved the making of @entity125			1
also scored in @entity110 on wednesday night and has 11 for the season 7 @entity128 - proving an increasingly integral part of @entity131 's system , @entity127 has licence to roam and run at defences			0
the 24 - year - old has proved he can cut it at the top level this season 7 total : 22/30 @entity105 helped @entity5 cruise past @entity110 5 - 1 in the round of 16 @entity125 continues to get better and better in a @entity5 shirt since his move from @entity28 @entity5 's @entity128 battles for the ball with @entity142 of @entity110 @entity143 not surprised by @entity3 win @entity31 @entity145 - the most chilled footballer around , @entity145 can still deliver the goods , as shown by his goal in @entity31 's shock 3 - 1 win over @entity150 in the first leg of the last round			1
his goal tally may not be what it once was , but the @entity155 is still more than capable of producing a moment of magic 7 @entity158 - while @entity145 is winding down , @entity158 is stepping up to the big time and hoping to live up to expectations			0
his goal return of five in 23 games this season is n't really good enough to suggest he 'll take the @entity3 by storm 6 @entity166 - @entity31 's other great young hope , @entity167 winger @entity166 came off the bench to score the decisive third at the @entity170			2
can trouble defences with his pace and positivity			0
7 total : 20/30 @entity145 leaps above the @entity150 defence during the second leg of their last 16 tie @entity158 gets clear of @entity150 midfielder @entity179 during the second leg in @entity31 @entity31 's @entity166 challenges for the ball with @entity150 's @entity182 @entity26 @entity184 - @entity26 's one - man show just ca n't keep himself out of the headlines , for better or worse			1
we all know , on his day , the @entity186 can be unplayable but @entity26 will have to do without him in the last eight following his sending off against @entity189			2
get through that and he could help them spring a surprise 8 @entity193 - linked with a move away from the @entity91 champions , if @entity196 is to depart this summer he 'll want to go out with a flourish			2
an ever - present in the @entity3 this season , the @entity198 has a great return of 18 goals this season , a third of those coming in @entity113 7.5 @entity204 - it 's been a hit - and - miss season for the @entity37 , who has also been linked with a move away from the @entity207			0
nonetheless , he played a role in helping to guide @entity26 past @entity189 in the last round and could yet conjure a winning moment 6.5 total : 22/30 @entity184 saw a red card against @entity189 but could still feature if @entity26 make the latter stages @entity196 in a test of strength with @entity189 's @entity215 during last week 's second leg in @entity217 @entity204 sneaks up on @entity189 captain @entity218 during the match at @entity220 @entity30 @entity222 so many magnificent creative talents in the team , it 's little wonder @entity30 are dominating domestically and the favourites to win the @entity3			1
but those chances need to be converted and @entity228 has been the man this season , with 17 goals in all competitions			0
there 's also that @entity234 fella too ... 8.5 @entity235 may be into his fourth decade but @entity236 is arguably in the form of his life			0
he has a remarkable 17 goals in 20 in the @entity240 , plus a couple more in @entity113 this season and has been terrorising defences and taking great pleasure from it 8.5 @entity246 - on the other side , @entity30 's alternative attacking force - @entity246			2
with three goals in the @entity3 campaign , he will inevitably have an impact if @entity30 are to go all the way again 8 total : 25/30 @entity228 celebrates scoring for @entity30 in their 7 - 0 rout of @entity254 @entity236 shows his flawless volley technique in the last 16 , second leg tie with @entity254 @entity91 star @entity246 celebrates scoring @entity30 's third goal in the large win over @entity254 @entity29 @entity259 - if @entity29 are to replicate their feats of 2004 and win the @entity3 , the goals of @entity261 @entity259 will be key			1
he 's already carrying them along , with five in the group phase			0
despite his absence with a calf injury , @entity29 prospered against @entity267 in last round but will want him back with tougher tests lying in wait 7.5 @entity271 - it 's been a productive loan spell for @entity273 , with seven goals and 11 assists contributed by the @entity4 forward			1
with a long - term stay at the @entity277 pretty unlikely , @entity273 should use these high - profile @entity3 games as a shop window 7 @entity281 - the @entity284 midfielder 's form is increasingly sharp , reaching a peak in the second leg with @entity267 where he scored and created another for @entity288			0
with nine assists overall this season , he can supply the ammunition for @entity259 and @entity273 ahead of him 7 total : 21.5/30 @entity271 leaps over the @entity267 goalkeeper @entity292 during the second leg @entity27 @entity294 is no mean task , but @entity296 has made a decent fist of it with 20 goals this season , including five in the @entity3			0
if @entity27 are to replicate last season 's amazing run to the final , they 'll need a few more from him 7.5 @entity305 - the @entity91 has been @entity27 's driving force and a very classy one at that			1
he has 17 goals and six assists so far this campaign and plays with flair and confidence 8 @entity314 - a striker who is slowly but surely putting the torrid times endured at @entity189 and @entity316 behind him back on familiar turf			0
yet to fully establish himself as a first - choice pick but may yet deliver that crucial goal 7 total : 22.5/30 @entity296 is challenged by @entity322 's @entity321 in the last round @entity27 's @entity305 uses the full width of the pitch to get around @entity322 's @entity326 @entity314 celebrates after scoring in the penalty shoot - out win over @entity322 in the last 16			2

@entity4 , @entity28 and @entity27 lead @entity330 charge
@entity30 are the sole *representatives* left from @entity333
@entity91 have @entity26 and @entity31 in the pot
@entity337 @entity5 and @entity338 *giants* @entity29 complete the line - up
there are no @entity10 clubs left in the competition this year
