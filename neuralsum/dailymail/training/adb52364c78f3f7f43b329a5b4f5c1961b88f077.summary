@entity2 , 34 , repeatedly assaulted the 18 - year - old victim during a 45 - minute attack in @entity13 town centre in february this year			1
a court heard how the victim thought she was going to die and begged @entity2 to stop his violent attack but he ignored her pleas and carried on the attack			1
@entity2 , who is 5ft 10 and weighs 19 stone had been jailed for eight years at @entity20 in 2001 for repeatedly raping and assaulting an 18 - year - old girl in a @entity22 upon @entity24 churchyard the previous year			1
but had only finally been freed from prison in october 2012 after being recalled for breaching the license of that release			2
@entity2 had been living in @entity29 and had moved to @entity13 just two days before he attacked his latest victim , the court was told			1
@entity13 @entity20 heard he had been living under an assumed name in the @entity33 hostel , but on the night of the rape had was refused entry by staff who believed he had been drinking			2
@entity38 had met the victim on the evening of february 23 in a takeaway in the town and bought her some food			1
they were said to have exchanged telephone numbers after @entity2 told her he could help her get a job			1
the following evening he texted the teenager and they met up in the town centre			0
he took her to an area behind some bins near @entity53 where he violently raped her			2
before the attack , the teenager sent a text to a former boyfriend which read : ' i 'm in some trouble			0
he wants to take me away and do lots of bad things to me			0
' she told police afterwards : ' i begged him			0
@entity66 knows how many times and he would n't let me go			0
i kept thinking i would die that night			0
' @entity68 , prosecuting , said : ' the defendant was to claim in interview that the girl had taken him to the area by the bins but she said he had taken her there			0
' once at the bins he asked her about her sexual preferences			0
she was at that point very uncomfortable and realised that she might be in trouble			0
' he told police that she had initiated sex with him and he did n't use a condom because she wanted children			0
' @entity2 has a long criminal record dating back to his teens for offences such as robbery , assault occasioning actual bodily harm , wounding and burglary			1
he had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two offences of rape			2

@entity2 had been living in @entity29 and had moved to @entity13 , above , just two days before the attack @entity2 , who has now converted to @entity96 , had also unsuccessfully tried to change his guilty pleas after realising that he could be jailed for life and did not want to be portrayed as a ' horrible beast '			1
@entity100 , defending , said @entity2 has been diagnosed with a dangerous severe personality disorder but was not regarded by psychiatrists as mentally ill. he said : ' my best point is that in any event the complainant was not required to go into the witness box and give evidence ' ' he wishes to tell the court that he now accepts he is guilty of rape but does not accept all the details the @entity112 puts forward			1
' judge @entity113 jailed @entity2 for life and told him he would serve a minimum term of imprisonment of seven years and 41 days before he could be considered for parole			1
the judge told @entity2 : ' i have come to the view that you are a very dangerous , violent sex offender			1
' in my view the risk you pose can not be satisfactorily met by the passing of a fixed period of imprisonment			0
' these offences are so serious they call for a life sentence to be passed on each count			2
only when the parole board is satisfied you no longer pose a risk of further offending will you be released			2
' the judge added : ' she was a vulnerable young woman of 18			2
in her words your behaviour became freaky			0
she was frightened and you told her to do as she wanted or you would punch her			0
sentence : the rapist , who has now converted to @entity96 , was jailed for life at @entity138 , above ' she was crying and you told her to ' shut the f * * * up ' and you spat in her face			1
she was begging you not to rape her and she was asking you to stop			0
' this was a violent incident and the physical and mental harm you have done to this woman must be profound and long lasting			0
' @entity2 was also placed on the sex offenders ' register for life			1
detective superintendent @entity147 , head of crime investigations at @entity149 , said afterwards : ' @entity2 is a violent sexual predator who has proved to be a danger to women			2
' firstly , i would like to commend the bravery of @entity2 's victim who was forced to relive the details of her horrific ordeal by providing full and frank details to @entity149 during this investigation			1
' she has displayed the utmost courage and strength during the course of this investigation and subsequent court case			0
' @entity2 was convicted of a rape in 2001 and was jailed for eight years			1
this second incident proves he has not been rehabilitated and remains a threat to women in our society			0

he was released in 2012 before assaulting 18 - year - old in february this year
the 19 - stone monster repeatedly raped his victim during 45 minute ordeal
