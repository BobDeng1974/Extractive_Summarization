@entity0 has warned @entity2 ’s under - achieving one - day cricketers that no one ’s place is safe after the series defeat by @entity6 and he is considering making key changes just five months before the @entity8			1
the crushing 3 - 1 loss , alleviated slightly by a much improved performance at @entity11 on friday , means @entity2 will shuffle their pack ahead of the series in @entity14 in november in another attempt to find a winning one - day formula			1
it remains highly unlikely @entity2 will replace @entity18 at this stage , even though @entity0 refused to guarantee that a captain who has spent most of the summer defending his position will lead the side in @entity23 and @entity24			2
cuts : @entity0 is ready to wield the axe and rid @entity2 of its under - performing players yet while @entity18 probably stays , others who may not make the cut include @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and perhaps even @entity34 , who is under pressure when he leads the @entity37 side against @entity6 at @entity38 today			1
@entity2 will consider bringing back @entity39 and @entity40 , while @entity41 has emerged as a left - arm alternative to @entity32 and @entity43 , persona non grata under the @entity46 regime , has support for a return			0
it is hardly ideal to still be in a state of flux so close to the most important competition in limited - overs cricket but @entity2 know changes have to be made even though they displayed a glimpse of their potential in @entity57			0
danger : @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity34 are all in danger of being dropped from the @entity2 squad @entity0 , who told his squad of his expectations after friday ’s win , is adamant there is nothing wrong with a game plan that has been derided as outdated by high - profile critics such as @entity68 and @entity69 but it is the execution of those plans that needs improving			1
@entity39 was unlucky to be left out of the @entity6 series but it has become clear that his omission was far from terminal and he will be given the chance to prove that he can bat in the top six and become @entity2 ’s sixth rather than fifth bowler			2
it remains a mystery why @entity40 , who scored 114 for @entity83 in the one - @entity84 semi-final yesterday , has not had many more opportunities in all formats but , like @entity39 , he may be handed a chance to show what he can do both today in @entity90 and in the seven - match 50 - over series in @entity14			0
@entity32 looks too one - dimensional to have a long - term future in international cricket and , with @entity0 wanting a left - arm seamer , a late chance could come for @entity41 ahead of @entity96 as long as he is fully fit			0
@entity8 : @entity2 need to make major changes if they are to stand any chance at the @entity8 perhaps the biggest issue facing @entity2 is the woeful form of their key one - day batsman @entity34 , who is in desperate need of a big score today to ease concerns about his form			1
it is becoming clear that , when @entity2 do decide the time is right to replace @entity18 as captain , @entity107 is the favourite to take over in all forms of the game , probably usurping @entity34 as captain - elect in one - day as well as test cricket			1
the selectors will consider their options over the next two weeks before naming a squad for @entity14 that , barring the injured @entity119 , will go on to the @entity8			0
‘ it ’s been extremely disappointing , ’ said @entity34 of a barren run that goes back to his brilliant century against @entity23 in @entity121 in january			0
‘ i ’ve worked incredibly hard this year but i ’ve been light on runs			0
series : @entity2 3 - 1 defeat to @entity6 in their one - day series highlighted the need for change ‘ i ’ve been finding different ways to get out			1
i ’ve gone through periods like this and i ’ve always come back so i ’m confident i will this time			0
’ it will be fascinating to see how the big - hitting @entity133 performs today but he remains a big outsider for a @entity8 place , not least because @entity2 are conscious of the massive gap between international and county cricket			2
it is naive to expect a batsman who can whack the ball in the domestic game to instantly produce the goods at the highest level against two new white balls in international one - day cricket			2
the difficulties in stepping up have been highlighted by @entity147 , who was quickly worked out by @entity6 ’s bowlers in the one - day series and has to counter tactics which have stifled his natural desire to stay leg - side of the ball and hit through the off side			1
despite @entity147 ’s success in international @entity37 cricket , his example will make @entity2 wary of promoting too many county form horses for the @entity8 even though they are open to late change .			0
