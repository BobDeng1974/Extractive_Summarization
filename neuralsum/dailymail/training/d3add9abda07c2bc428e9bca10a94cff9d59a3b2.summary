even images of the @entity11 , @entity11 , have been used by rogues behind the so - called @entity13			1
thousands of women in @entity15 and around the world have been duped by the scam , which is being promoted by paid for advertisements on @entity19			2
consequently , @entity19 itself is profiting from a rip - off that is using the power of celebrity to target thousands of women who are trying to lose weight			0
a number of company names are being used by the rogues behind the scam , including @entity30 , which apparently operates via an address in @entity33 and has @entity35 owners			1
images and comments from the celebrities appear on @entity19 alongside links encouraging people to sign up for what appear to be free or cheap trials of supplements which make ludicrous and inconsistent claims about speeding metabolism and weight loss			2
however , customers , who are asked for bank direct debit details , then find they have signed up to pay around £ 80 a month for repeat supplies of the supplements			0
many people find it extremely difficult to get through to the company to cancel the payments with the result it is making millions of pounds from victims of the scam			1
the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) issues a ruling today banning internet ads for @entity30 which featured doctored images of @entity5 and a faked endorsement			1

' no recommendation : @entity70 of @entity71 , left , and @entity8 , right , were among ' celebrities ' who were falsely said to have endorsed the product clicking on the ad linked to the home page of a website for fatshred.com , which carried what appeared to be a magazine style article about @entity5 ’s weight loss and the effects of two weight loss products			2
the headline promised a new series called ‘ diet tips from the stars ’ and information on how @entity5 had dropped four dress sizes			0

’ legal advice : @entity9 told her twitter followers that her lawyers were looking into the company 's claims that she had endorsed their product customers were then invited to order @entity30 and @entity113 tablets under a free trial with reduced shipping charges			1
further text on the web page carried the ludicrous claim that ‘ @entity119 has been found to increase metabolism , boosting weight loss by 800 per cent ’			0
in fact , @entity5 has nothing to do with @entity30			1
the company also failed to defend or explain its claims when contacted by the @entity58			0
