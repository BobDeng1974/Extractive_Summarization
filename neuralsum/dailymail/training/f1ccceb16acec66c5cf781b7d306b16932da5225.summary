by @entity0 sir @entity1 , head of @entity3 's spy watchdog , has condemned claims by @entity6 's reporters claims by supporters of rogue agent @entity6 that @entity3 ’s spy agencies were as sinister as their counterparts in @entity11 and @entity12 were condemned last night as ‘ insidious ’ and unforgivable			1
the comments by the head of @entity3 ’s spy watchdog , sir @entity1 , will be seen as a direct attack on @entity18 newspaper			1
it published vast amounts of previously secret information stolen by @entity6 , pictured , from his former employers at the @entity23 which revealed in detail the extent of secret surveillance in the @entity3			1
in a speech at @entity29 ’s @entity28 , sir @entity1 , the chairman of the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , said : ‘ it is ironic that mr @entity6 , in the name of privacy and the rule of law , chose @entity12 and @entity11 from which to launch his attack on the @entity37			1
‘ intelligence agencies exist in every state , both democratic and authoritarian , throughout the world			2
while they share certain things in common , we must never lose sight of the differences			2
‘ intelligence agencies within authoritarian systems may wish to protect the public from terrorism and some types of serious crime			2
but their primary objective is the preservation of the regime they serve			2
‘ unfortunately , the insidious use of language such as ‘ mass surveillance ’ and ‘ orwellian ’ by many of mr @entity6 ’s supporters to describe the actions of western agencies blurs , unforgivably , the distinction between a system that uses the state to protect the people , and one that uses the state to protect itself against the people			1
’ unlike spy agencies in authoritarian countries , @entity3 ’s spies do not want to be ‘ all seeing ’ or ‘ all hearing ’ , he said			1
instead , they operate with ‘ noble motivations ’ and under ‘ lawful authority ’			2
his comments came ahead of the publication today of a report by the @entity80 calling for the @entity31 to be stripped of its monopoly of scrutiny of the three intelligence and security agencies			1
in what will be seen as a power grab , it called for wider scrutiny by @entity89 and for direct elections to the committee by mps in the @entity93			2
the committee declared that the current governance arrangements were designed for the @entity96 era of @entity97 and had failed to keep up with the modern era			2
the report said current scrutiny was ‘ ineffective ’			2
@entity6 , a former contractor with the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) and @entity23 stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files and leaked them to @entity18 and the @entity104 with reference to @entity97 ’s fictional @entity96 spy @entity107 , @entity31 chairman @entity105 mp said : ‘ the current system of oversight is designed to scrutinise the work of @entity107 not the 21st century reality of the security and intelligence services			1
‘ the agencies are at the cutting edge of sophistication and are owed an equally refined system of democratic scrutiny			0
‘ it is an embarrassing indictment of our system that some in the media felt compelled to publish leaked information to ensure that matters were heard in @entity89			0
‘ the @entity31 should be given a democratic mandate in the same way as other @entity128			0
we will then be able to robustly defend our methods of scrutiny and better serve those who protect us , and the public			0
’ while accepting that scrutiny could be improved , sir @entity1 defended his work and pointed to holes the arguments made by critics of the services			1
editor of the @entity18 , @entity140			1
the comments by the head of @entity3 's spy watchdog , sir @entity1 , will be seen as a direct attack on @entity18 newspaper he said : ‘ our agencies are not , and do not wish to be , ‘ all - seeing ’ , nor ‘ all - hearing ’			1
their capabilities have been designed to pursue their lawful , narrowly - defined objectives			0
‘ true public servants operate with noble motivations , lawful authority , and subject to rigorous oversight			0
these are the values that distinguish public servants from a public threat			0
that is how those who work for our intelligence agencies see themselves			0
’ comparisons with the @entity37 were false , he added , because of different approaches to surveillance in the two countries			0
@entity3 has no database of its citizens ’ telephone communications , he said , so can not abolish it , as president @entity169 is proposing			1
he pointed out that when a terrorist atrocity occurs , the public asks why so little was known about who did it			0
by contrast in the wake of the @entity6 revelations a ‘ smaller but vocal minority ’ has been asking why so much surveillance is needed			0
and he said the internet age and the use of new technology by terrorists meant more surveillance was needed and greater intrusion tolerated than when the enemy was foreign governments			0
he said : ‘ most people recognise that if actual or potential terrorists are to be apprehended , there is likely to be a considerably greater degree of intrusion into the privacy of the public by the security services than was required when our enemies were restricted to foreign governments			0
it was wrong to claim that intelligence agencies had some ‘ sinister intent ’			0
earlier this year @entity201 director general @entity200 warned in a speech that revealing details about the work of @entity205 was a ‘ gift to terrorists ’ , while sir @entity206 , head of @entity207 , said terrorists were ‘ rubbing their hands with glee ’			1
@entity6 , a former contractor with the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) and @entity23 stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files and leaked them to @entity18 and the @entity104			1
he eventually sought refuge in @entity11 where he was granted asylum .			0
