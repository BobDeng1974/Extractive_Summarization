by @entity0 not so long ago , if a race got physical , @entity1 admits she would be left wondering what had hit her			2
now , with yet another huge stride having just been taken on her impressively rapid and upward career trajectory , the 21 - year - old insists she is more than capable of giving as good as she gets			1
the unwelcome blip of failing to make the 800 metres final at the @entity9 in march seemed to have been well and truly forgotten earlier this week as @entity10 surveyed @entity11 and the multi-coloured arena which will provide the stage for two landmark athletics meetings that could potentially send this modest shooting star into a different stratosphere			1
ready to rumble : @entity1 has toughened up for the @entity17 one , of course , is the @entity17 , where she plans to contest both the 800m and 1500m			1
the other , which comes first , is the @entity23 meeting which will pitch up at the home of @entity26 football on july 11 and 12			2
@entity10 – who clearly ca n’t wait to try out the revolutionary track - will run the 800m on that occasion and , in what will be a fascinating sub plot , so too will her compatriot @entity32			1
the fact that both are finding form at just the right time means a @entity26 head - to - head for honours is considerably more than just a remote a possibility			1
on sunday , in the @entity42 city of @entity43 , @entity10 took part in her first race of the outdoor season and promptly ran a 1500m personal best time of 4:02.91			1
at the same meeting @entity32 , who has not had her injury troubles to seek , was also breaking new ground for herself – a time of 2:00:09 providing an 800m personal best and putting the @entity52 champion second in the @entity17 rankings			1
moving up a rung on the athletic ladder has to be hard - earned though and , even if it might not necessarily be part of her nature away from competition , @entity10 insists she is more than happy to fight her corner now when it comes to the dark arts of racing			1
‘ i remember during what was my first race of quite a high standard , at the @entity69 in @entity70 , and i got spiked and pushed – i just came off the track thinking : “ what have i been doing for the past seven years ? this not what i ’ve been doing ! ” , ’ said the 21 - year - old			1
bouncing back : @entity10 has recovered from her disappointment at the @entity9 ‘ i ’ve learned a lot			1
it ’s been a very steep learning curve over the past couple of years but it ’s been really good , i enjoy it , and now i know to just shrug it off , get my elbows out and i ’ll be fine			1
’ those elbows had to be sharpened and put to good use in @entity43 , a race which provided just the sort of preparation and confidence boost to fuel @entity10 ’s missions this summer			1
‘ it was just really good to be back racing , ’ she said of her second - place finish			1
‘ i really enjoyed it			2
i was nice and relaxed and calm going into it			2
' i stuck at the front and then just went with a couple of hundred to go			2
i felt really strong – there was a bit of elbowing and pushing on the home straight – but i managed to get past it and felt really good			1
‘ it ’s strange because i am quite quiet but i think that certainly when i go out on the track it ’s a flip of a switch			0
friendly rivalry : @entity32 is also competing in the 800m ‘ but you ’ve got to be ( aggressive )			1
i think if i was n’t then i would n’t be where i am today			0
i think it does take a strong character to race and race well tactically			0
if you let other people intimidate you then that ’s just not how to race really			0
' you ’ve just got to be really confident in yourself and that ’s what i try to do			0
i just have to hold my position , which can be a bit hard when i ’m a bit smaller than quite a lot of them , but i just know that i ’ve got the ability so i know i have to be in the right place at the right time and i ’ll be stronger than them in the finish			0
’ the good news is that @entity10 thinks there is plenty still to come from her			1
there is a calm certainty in her voice when she insists that her 1500m time will translate into her breaking the two - minute barrier for 800m			1
‘ i feel like i could have run faster ( in @entity43 ) , ’ she added			0
‘ the way my training is going , it ( running under two minutes ) should be on the cards			0
' it ’s quite a landmark for a distance runner to break that mark , even for guys			0
i ’m not going to push for it though			0
times come when they come			0
it depends on the race			0
even though the 800m is not as variable , you might get a slower race			1
i never chase times but the time will come			0
’ having such fierce competition from close to home in the form of @entity156 will help keep motivation levels high , of course			2
so did @entity10 have sympathy for the 23 - year - old at the weekend when she missed out so narrowly on ducking under 120 seconds ? ‘ i was delighted to see her back , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ and she took a half - second off her personal best			2
you ca n’t put any downers on that			0
you ’re so close but , at the same time , you ran a pb			0
it ’s great to see she ’s back			0
she raced really well and i ’m sure it will come			0
‘ middle - distance running in @entity26 is so good just now			1
it ’s probably partly due to the competition			2
it ’s driving people to train even harder but it ’s great to see so many athletes in the distance events			0
you ’re not even guaranteed a spot on the @entity26 team , never mind the @entity183 team , which is really good			2
’ dress rehearsal : @entity10 will appear in the @entity186 @entity185 next month before national service , however , comes the @entity23 and another chance to sparkle in @entity186			1
‘ it will really help because you get a sense of the atmosphere and what it ’s going to be like , ’ said @entity10 of the opportunity to sample competing in the famous venue			1
‘ where the warm - up is and the call room and the layout and the surroundings			2
and the feel of the track as well			0
it ’s hard for people to understand but some are faster than others			0
' you can tell with some having longer straights and tighter bends			0
it will be nice to get out there and see what it ’s like			0
’ watch the world ’s best athletes including @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 at the @entity220 ’s @entity219 on july 11 - 12			2

@entity10 ready to give as good as she gets in @entity186 this summer
