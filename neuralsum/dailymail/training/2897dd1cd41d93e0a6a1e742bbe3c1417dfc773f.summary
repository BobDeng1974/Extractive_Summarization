the dramatic moment when a devastated @entity1 accused his wife of adultery has been revealed in the previously unseen papers of his former private secretary			1
in a scene that undermines the myth that the marriage was ‘ the greatest love affair in the world ’ , the former @entity8 tearfully told @entity14 , the divorcee for whom he gave up the throne in 1936 , to break off her relationship with a wealthy playboy			1
the private notebooks of @entity19 , which she kept secretly during her service with the royal couple , offer further evidence that after 13 years of marriage , the @entity25 had became bored with her husband , leading to an affair with a young @entity29 19 years her junior , @entity30 , who until then had been a promiscuous homosexual			1
she came in and , gaily unknowing , went into [ his room ]			2
‘ i heard him choking back the tears in his voice , telling her what he had heard			2
i heard him say what he had no doubt rehearsed over and over again – “ it ’s not because you are the @entity14 , it ’s because you are my wife			2
any man would mind his wife doing this			2
” ‘ his voice wavered			0
she never said a single word – or at any rate i did n’t hear her voice , and very soon she came out , all her gaiety gone – walking slowly with her head bent , her face submissive , her eyes blue & bewildered			0
she gave me a quick glance as she went through my room			0
‘ she was very quiet and submissive for a long time afterwards			0
she telephoned immediately cancelling whatever arrangement she had made with the young man			0
’ and miss @entity19 says damningly of the @entity73 : ‘ she revelled in this shoddy little success			1
’ @entity25 had started her affair with @entity30 aboard the @entity77 in may 1950 , when she was 54 and he 35 , having first met him at his mother ’s home in @entity80 nine years earlier			1
he was a grandson of the founder of @entity82 ’s and led an indolent life after being kicked out of @entity84 , the ‘ @entity85 ’ , for non-attendance			1
@entity30 with the @entity25 at a nightclub in @entity41 the affair continued even after the @entity1 ’s intervention , and came to an end in 1954 , when he finally lost patience with his wife ’s lover			1
miss @entity19 , who worked at close quarters with the couple in @entity96 and @entity41 between 1950 and 1954 , wrote in her notebook of the @entity73 : ‘ she naively always hoped to get away with her affairs – brazened it out when another would have given herself away by seeming guilty			1
’ she added : ‘ [ she was ] determined to have her fun – but when she realised she had been caught out , she did n’t excuse herself or try to fool him			0
‘ she was also really [ regretful ] at having upset him because although i was pretty sure she never felt the same passionate love for him as he did for her , she was very fond of him and had set herself the job of making him happy			0
but it was a “ job ”			0
it was n’t a reciprocal love on the same scale as his for her			0
’ the notebooks , stored in a recently opened archive in @entity118 , @entity119 , are particularly revealing because throughout her life @entity121 , who died aged 92 in 2011 , publicly maintained her devoted support for the @entity123			2
@entity124 with the @entity1 at a fancy dress party in @entity29 in the 1950s the @entity128 tiger brooch the @entity1 gave his wife after the affair she wrote : ‘ when @entity134 was happy , he used to call her “ @entity135 ”			1
nothing could be further from the truth ! ’ and of the @entity1 she observed : ‘ @entity137 [ @entity138 , one of the @entity1 ’s early biographers ] misses the essential point about his character – his fundamental uncertainty about his sexuality & his ability to be a heterosexual man			0
he was fundamentally afraid of women			0
’ for four years , as i revealed in my biography @entity148 : the @entity123 and @entity30 , the trio were inseparable			1
the @entity1 , who was pathologically worried about money and happy to allow others to bankroll his expensive lifestyle , knowingly allowed himself to be cuckolded			0
although rumours often swirled about the @entity73 ’s relationship with @entity30 , his previously homosexual love - life led observers to believe that there was no sexual attraction between them			1
after the affair ended , the dynamic between husband and wife remained unchanged – he needy , she expecting total devotion			1
a bejewelled @entity128 tiger brooch and matching bracelet which were ordered by the @entity1 after the affair are being sold at @entity169 in november and are expected to fetch £ 1.5 million .			2
