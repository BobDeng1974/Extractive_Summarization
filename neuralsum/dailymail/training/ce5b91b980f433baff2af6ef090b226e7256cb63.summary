researchers found that the longer the painkiller is taken , the lower the risk of developing melanoma			2
the study of data from almost 60,000 women over 12 years found that regular aspirin users were 21 per cent less likely to develop skin cancer than non-users			1
but those who had taken it for five or more years were 30 per cent less likely to develop melanoma			0
data for men was not part of the study			0
every year , around 13,000 people in the @entity28 are diagnosed with malignant melanoma , and 2,200 die from the disease , which is thought to be caused primarily by intense sunbathing or frequent use of sunbeds			1
aspirin has been dubbed the wonder drug , with a recent study claiming that it cut the risk of stomach and bowel cancers by around 40 per cent in regular users			1
however , long - term use has been linked with stomach bleeds and ulcers			0
the research of women aged between 50 to 79 was published in the @entity45 and formed part of the women ’s health initiative – a major @entity49 investigation into links between lifestyle and the disease			0
study leader dr @entity53 said : ‘ @entity2 works by reducing inflammation and this may be why using aspirin may lower your risk of developing melanoma			2
’ she said other painkillers , such as paracetamol , did not lower melanoma			0

@entity90 , of @entity91 , advised caution , however			0
she said : ‘ @entity2 has a range of serious side effects , and at the moment it ’s not clear whether the benefits would outweigh the harms , what the right dose might be , or which group of people are most likely to benefit			0
’ despite drastic efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment , @entity28 ’s cancer survival rates still lag behind other countries			1
ministers estimated that 11,400 lives could be saved each year if our cancer survival rates matched those elsewhere in @entity112 .			2

aspirin is found to prevent stomach and bowel cancers and now skin cancer
every year 13,000 people in the @entity28 are diagnosed with malignant melanoma
