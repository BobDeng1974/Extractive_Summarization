hypnosis helps women recover more quickly from debilitating breast cancer surgery , researchers claim			1
patients who are put in a trance just before the operation spend less time in hospital and also have fewer side effects if they need chemotherapy			1
they are hypnotised by an anaesthetist who talks softly about a chosen topic such as cooking or the beach , before administering a local anaesthetic to numb their breasts			2

hypnosis helps women recover more quickly from debilitating breast cancer surgery , researchers claim doctors at one hospital in @entity26 say the technique has been so successful there that a fifth of the women undergoing surgery for breast cancer are now hypnotised beforehand			1
in research presented at the @entity33 @entity32 in @entity34 they compared 110 women who had been hypnotised with 110 undergoing standard surgery			1
the women who were hypnotised were only given a local anaesthetic - on the presumption that the trance - like state was enough to numb any pain - whereas the others were put to sleep under a general anaesthetic			2
researchers found that hypnotised patients spent a day less in hospital afterwards and were keen to be discharged , whereas those given general anaesthetic were not ready to go home			1
a third of women who then underwent chemotherapy or radiotherapy suffered less severe side effects of fatigue and nausea , the researchers found			1
doctors at one hospital in @entity26 say the technique has been so successful there that a fifth of the women undergoing surgery for breast cancer are now hypnotised beforehand lead researcher dr @entity61 , of the @entity62 in @entity26 said it was though the hypnotised patient was in the ' operating room but her spirit is not '			1
she said it was the first time in her clinical experience patients , had asked to go home so soon : ‘ it ’s a positive finding , in all cases they said ‘ i have recovered and i want to go home			0

dr @entity61 said that she hoped that in future research would show hypnosis also prevented cancer from returning			0
professor @entity94 , a cancer specialist at @entity95 said : ‘ i think these data are extremely impressive as they show a rapid recovery			0
‘ it ’s an extremely interesting study			0
