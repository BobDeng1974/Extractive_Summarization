hats off to @entity2 for the genius job he has done in rebuilding @entity5 's depleted side			1
pundits and fans feared for the club 's @entity9 future when they lost @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 - among others - in the summer			1
but their third place in the table , including that 8 - 0 thrashing of @entity19 at the weekend , has taken everyone by surprise			1
but @entity2 came in , sorted through the rubble and patiently sought - out their replacements			2
even then , two relative unknowns from @entity39 's @entity38 – @entity27 and @entity40 – were not the star names supporters were hoping for and the loans of @entity43 and @entity44 did not , on first impression , appear adequate defensive acquisitions			1
however , on early - season form , @entity2 has made by far the shrewdest signings of the window			2
@entity50 takes a look at how the new recruits have stepped into the boots of their predecessors			0
@entity5 boss @entity2 has done a terrific job at the club since taking over in the summer @entity57 on the ball for @entity5 who are currently third in the @entity9 with 16 points @entity40 ( £ 10.9m from @entity61 ) v @entity13 ( sold to @entity62 £ 25m ) @entity13 was perhaps the hardest to replace after he moved			1
while @entity11 was scoring the goals , @entity13 was providing the heartbeat of the side			2
so often he was involved in everything going forward and as well as being able to unlock defences with a pass from anywhere in the final third , he weighed in with his share of goals too			0
but @entity40 has displayed wizardry to match the attacking midfielder ; seven assists in eight games , 20 chances created , 278 passes , 88 crosses and one goal			0
@entity40 ( left ) has excelled in filling the void left by former @entity5 captain @entity13 ' he is always moving and moving to spaces to play and give the assists which creative players can and that is difficult , ' was @entity2 's assessment			1
' players like @entity40 have to score between seven , eight and nine goals every season and he knows now he has to work hard for that			0
' if there was any fear @entity5 would flatline without @entity13 , @entity40 has been the defibrillator sparking them back to life			1
@entity43 ( loan from @entity96 ) v @entity12 ( sold to @entity97 £ 31m ) the loss of @entity12 was another huge blow to the club			1
@entity12 is one of the most exciting left backs in the country – nurtured into an @entity104 player at @entity5 – and he had taken to the top - flight with ease			1
he often played more like a left winger than a left - back , but was rarely caught out defensively			0
there really is no replacement for a player of that ability , still only 19 , but @entity2 wanted a full back with a similar attacking threat and in @entity115 he has found that			0
saints signed @entity96 left back @entity43 ( left ) on a season - long loan to replace @entity12 this season ' i ca n't compare him with @entity12 because i do n't know a lot about @entity12 but we are happy to have that kind of player in our squad , ' @entity2 said			1
' he brings quality , he brings personality , and he knows about the level and pressure of @entity96 and that 's important for the rest of the team			0
' while @entity12 has struggled for fitness and with injury at @entity97 this campaign , @entity43 has been flying on that flank for @entity5			1
@entity27 ( £ 8million from @entity136 ) v @entity11 ( sold to @entity62 £ 4m ) @entity11 will always be a hero on the south coast			1
his goals played a huge part in firing them from the third tier to the top flight in just two seasons ; scoring 21 the year they went up from @entity145 and 31 in the @entity146			0
his strikes in the @entity9 also earned him an @entity104 call - up , but there is no denying he was struggling for form in the latter stages of last season			2
this campaign he is yet to score for @entity62 , has missed good chances and has been limited to 125 minutes in the league			0
@entity27 striker @entity27 ( left ) has settled in well at the club scoring a double in their 8 - 0 win vs @entity19 in comparison , @entity27 is keeping pace with the league 's top - scorers with six in eight games and is lighting up @entity164 's with goals such as the overhead kick he scored against @entity167			1
even when he scored twice and ran @entity19 's back line ragged at the weekend , @entity27 insisted he ' did n’t play so well			2
' @entity2 witnessed first - hand his prolific goal - scoring while in charge at @entity136 , where he netted 50 goals in 57 league games in the past two seasons			2
he has had no trouble in transferring that to @entity176 football			0
@entity44 ( loaned from @entity177 ) v @entity14 ( sold to @entity62 £ 20m ) @entity14 was developing a reputation as one of the best centre backs in the league last season			2
he angered @entity5 fans by publicly forcing through a move to @entity62 but the centre of their defence looked weak without him			0
@entity187 has established himself as a solid centre half but @entity190 's name on a team - sheet must have had centre forwards rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the game ahead			0
@entity44 ( left ) has provided steel in the @entity5 defence since @entity14 's ( right ) departure @entity44 , fresh from being part of @entity177 's side which won @entity201 and were runners up in the @entity203 , has been exactly what they needed			1
he is strong positionally , is good on the ball and at playing his way out from the back			0
' he 's an experienced player , ' @entity2 explained			2
' he 's played a the high level of the @entity203			0
we need that , it 's a long season , it 's another competitive player for the rest of the squad			0

@entity5 thrashed @entity19 8 - 0 in the @entity9 on saturday
*victory* at @entity164 's sees the club third with 16 points after eight matches
the club sold key personnel in the summer in captain @entity13 , @entity12 , @entity11 and @entity14
new boss @entity2 has since bought in quality replacements in @entity40 , @entity43 , @entity27 and @entity44
