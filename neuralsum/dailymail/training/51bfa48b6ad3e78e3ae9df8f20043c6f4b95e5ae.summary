it was a whirlwind romance , culminating in a sumptuous summer wedding in august last year , but last night @entity2 confirmed that she and her husband @entity3 were not to be			1
the former model and polo player revealed the pair had split after just forth months of marriage telling @entity8 : ' it is with sadness that @entity3 and i have separated			1
my priority remains my son @entity13			2
' the couple had been together for nearly 18 months and had spoken of their hope that they would spend the rest of their lives together			1
it is thought that they separated just before @entity23			2
in happier times : @entity2 and @entity3 attended an event together in october shortly after their marriage - last night the model confirmed that they have split after just four months covering up : posing with @entity31 there were times when @entity2 seemed to make an effort to cover her un-ringed finger no ring : @entity2 was spotted at @entity37 launch today in an all black outfit having removed her wedding and engagement rings			1
@entity2 was then spotted today at @entity37 launch in @entity42 having removed her wedding and engagement rings			1
for mother - of - one @entity2 , 35 , who was previously married to internet entrepreneur @entity44 , it 's not her first divorce			1
her marriage to @entity47 lasted just 18 months and she was reportedly blindsided when he decided to split in 2007 - she 'd similarly said that she thought she and @entity44 would be together forever			2
indeed the similarities between the two situations are undoubtedly glaring			2
when @entity2 married @entity44 , she described him as , ' the man i am going to spend the rest of my life with			1
' then when she tied the knot with author @entity3 , 34 , @entity2 told @entity56 : ' as soon as @entity3 and i met , i went through a huge 360 in my mind			1
i thought , " that 's it , we 're going to spend the rest of our lives together			2
" ' everything has changed in my life			0
he 's given me the confidence to go and conquer the world			0
' speaking about @entity2 , @entity3 said : ' i 'm the luckiest guy in the world			1
with my parents being childhood sweethearts , i wanted to get married			2
but i did wonder is i was going to ever meet someone i wanted to spend the rest of my life with			0
' wedding day : @entity2 and @entity3 were pictured arriving at their wedding in august , however their marriage only lasted four months happy families : @entity2 and @entity3 took her son @entity13 to the @entity79 launch in december after her split from @entity44 , @entity2 admitted that perhaps they had n't known each other as well as they should have			1
she said in an interview with @entity84 in 2008 : ' it was the wedding year , then i went , " whoa ! i do n't really know you and i do n't think you know me either			2
" we were complete opposites			0
and then we got divorced - it was a terrible , awful , awful period			0
' in today 's reports @entity8 claimed that the reason @entity2 and @entity3 decided to go their separate ways was because they had rushed things and had n't got to know each other well enough either			1
history repeating itself : @entity2 split from her first husband @entity44 in 2007 , she has previously revealed that she did n't think the couple knew each other well enough to have married @entity2 got engaged to @entity3 in january 2014 , after a two - month romance , after splitting from the father of her two - year - old son , @entity104			1
they then married at the @entity106 in @entity107 , @entity108 , after just 10 months together			1
she wore a floor - length @entity110 style @entity112 gown whilst @entity3 opted for a smart grey suit			1
following a church service - where @entity13 played pageboy - the couple celebrated their nuptials with close friends and family at the 16th century home they lived in			1
so why is @entity2 so quick to fall in love and rush down the aisle ? one reason could be that she is trying to recreate the family unit she lost when her parents @entity128 and @entity129 divorced in 2007			1
splitting in the same year as she and @entity44 did , @entity2 has previously spoken about how damaged she felt after their break up			1
@entity2 had a son with @entity104 , pictured , getting together with @entity3 shortly after their split in 2013 @entity135 , divorce lawyer at @entity136 said : ' generally when a marriage only lasts four months the court will try and put the parties back to where they were pre marriage when dividing their assets			1
unless of course there is a pre nuptial agreement			0
' people often think that after such a short marriage they can get the relationship annulled but in @entity150 they will have to wait a year before divorce proceedings can be started			0
' and unless the marriage is unconsummated there are unlikely to be grounds for annulment			0
' it can often take couples married for this short a period more time to officially separate than those who have been together longer who can get a quickie divorce in a matter of months , because they have to wait until they have been married a year before they can start proceedings			1
' @entity2 is the great - granddaughter of press baron @entity161 , and one of three children born to show jumper @entity165 and his wife , @entity128 , herself the daughter of baronet sir @entity169			1
she revealed she was with her brother @entity171 , 42 , and sister @entity172 , 40 , at the family home in @entity174 for @entity175 when their father dropped the bombshell that he had fallen in love with an @entity181 stuntwoman almost 30 years his junior			0
i did n't really know what was happening			2
when my parents separated , the perfect picture of our family was completely shattered , ' @entity2 said at the time			1
' it was incredibly tough for us , and it affected us all much more than we thought it ever could			0
' indeed , it was perhaps the end of her parents marriage - and the failure of her relationship with @entity44 - that led her to make the wrong decisions in her future relationships			0
' i was shocked , completely and utterly shocked , ' she said of the experience of watching her parents split , ' everything we knew was a lie			2
' suddenly , we were in a different dimension			0
my parents had always been together , and i was proud of that			0
as the youngest child , i suppose i never really knew what was going on			2
' there had been issues for a while , which i did n't know about			2
it 's only now that i 'm really starting to speak to @entity216 and @entity217 about it			0

she has also filled out over the years after being referred to as a ' a sick anorexic giraffe ' who criticised her ' heroin chic , ' looks			0
despite having worked on several lucrative contracts over the years for brands like @entity238 and @entity239 , @entity2 had always been lampooned for what people referred to as her ' skeletal ' size			1
@entity2 is currently preparing to take part in the @entity244 show @entity243 which starts on sunday			2
she is up against fellow celebrities such as @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249			0
she has previously referred to herself as an , ' adrenaline junkie , ' and has an attitude which is perhaps belying of how she likes to live her life			0
she once said : ' i love fast action			0
' i 'm terrible at thinking things over			0
i go , " right , let 's move on to the next thing			0
i have to keeping moving forwards , otherwise i think i 'll get swallowed up			0
