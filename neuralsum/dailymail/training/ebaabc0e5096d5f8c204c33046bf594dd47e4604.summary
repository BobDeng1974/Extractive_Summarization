' public order offence ' : the council has ordered that this bush carved into the shape of an offensive hand gesture in @entity6 's garden be altered after a complaint from a neighbour mr @entity6 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , said : ' i was contacted by the police and they said the council had been in touch because somebody had complained to them about it			1
' apparently , one person was offended by it and the police said it was a public order offence			1
' i do n't intend to change it though - i ’m not a trouble maker and i do n’t want to offend anyone , but at the same time it ’s been here for eight years and i do n’t see why i should have anybody telling me what to change in my garden			0
' mr @entity6 says his neighbours are backing his pledge to the keep the shrubbery and have even started a ‘ save the @entity44 ’ campaign			2

' i do n’t think the policeman wanted to be here as much as i wanted him here , but he did ask me if i could make alterations to it - but i wo n’t			0
' mr @entity6 claims the bush had become something of a minor celebrity figure in his village and people enjoyed looking at it			2
it sits next to three other intricately carved pieces of foliage			0

there are trees either side of it so it ’s not offensive at all			0

they said if they did receive a formal complaint they would look into it - and deal with it proportionately			0
