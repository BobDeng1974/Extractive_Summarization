a three - day - old girl has become the latest victim of @entity2 because the hospital she was in had no electricity			2
the parents of baby @entity6 were forced to keep up a day and night routine of pumping air into her lungs by hand when she was born with newborn asphyxia			1
despite their round - the - clock efforts , the little girl died three days later on the first floor of the @entity16 hospital chapel , which now serves as the neonatal unit			0
she had asphyxia - where a baby does n't breathe in the first minute following birth			2
doctors believe she could have been saved if their incubators had been working newborn asphyxia is a condition where a baby does not start breathing in the minute following birth , and is the most common cause of infant mortality in the @entity48			1
the @entity33 medical centre has been badly damaged by the storm			1
it is partly flooded , walls have collapsed , part of the roof has fallen in , and there is no power			0
the little girl was born five days after the strongest storm ever to make landfall ripped through the city			0
@entity6 has died after just three days of life after she stopped breathing and there was no electricity to power incubators in order to keep her alive ( file picture ) the neonatal unit in @entity33 hospital ( pictured ) has had to be moved into the chapel after the storm flooded parts of the centre , knocking down walls and causing part of the roof to cave in @entity6 's parents spent three days pumping air into her lungs by hand , but their efforts were not enough to save her			1
doctors have said that if the incubators were working she could have lived ( file picture ) her 18 - year - old mother shared shifts working a hand air pump with the girl 's father in an effort to keep her alive			1
however she eventually died and doctors have said that if the hospital 's incubators were working , she could have been saved			0
@entity6 was one of the 24 babies in the hospital ’s neonatal ward , which had to be moved from the flooded ground floor to a chapel one floor above			2
the chapel ’s 28 pews have been turned into makeshift beds for mothers , some of whom are so weak themselves that they lie with iv drips in their arms			0
while the city of @entity33 is the hardest hit , other towns , such as @entity110 , on @entity112 island province , have also been badly affected and left without aid as roads have been left strewn with debris according to the national disaster relief agency , nearly 4 million people have been displaced by the storm @entity120 medical teams have been treating wounded and vulnerable people as they wait for mercy flights to take them away from @entity33 's ruined airport today the @entity125 destroyer @entity126 arrived in @entity127 , a port near to @entity33 , to start providing emergency aid			1
the ship is carrying 500 shelter kits , 10 tonnes of high energy biscuits and will use its water filers to fill 1,900 tankers with clean drinking water			0
it joins a team of 12 @entity125 doctors already helping the survivors , as donations to the @entity125 's crisis appeal have topped £ 33million , with another £ 30million being pledged by the government			0
some victims have had to wait for days to be rescued by aircraft , such as this @entity145 c - 130 military cargo plane , before being taken to @entity146 , capital of the @entity48 any building still standing is being used to treat survivors like @entity149 , who is seen here inside a school in @entity110 , @entity112 island province			2
