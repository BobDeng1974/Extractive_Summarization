@entity0 came under harsh criticism today after it emerged that a couple managed to broadcast a 20 - minute live sex session via a ' chatroom function ' on the new @entity5			1
the man and woman , believed to be @entity8 , were seen having sex on the @entity5 's playroom feature - which allows gamers to use a built - in webcam to communicate with each other			1
it is meant to encourage users to share their gaming sessions with people all over the world and the playroom broadcasts can been seen by people of any age using the console 's service			0
different state of play : a couple , thought to be @entity8 , filmed themselves having sex , and broadcast it live to thousands on @entity5 's chatroom feature @entity29 this week , @entity29 for @entity5 , which does not have a filter for unsuitable content , was used by one couple to broadcast a seedy 20 - minute sex session			1
the pair , believed to be somewhere in @entity8 , performed a multitude of sex acts which were viewed by more than 1,000 people - some of whom commented on the on - going action			1
since its launch last november , more than 4.2 million @entity5 consoles have been sold worldwide			1
one of the people who saw the footage was @entity47 , 34 , a @entity48 's manager of @entity49 , @entity50			0
he turned on his playstation at about 8am on monday morning - and the video appeared on the @entity29 's ' most popular ' section			1
popular console : since its launch last november ( pictured ) , more than 4.2 million @entity5 consoles have been sold worldwide mr @entity47 said : ‘ i often go to the @entity29 on my @entity5 when i do n't have much else to do , because you quite often find funny people or gaming sessions there			1
‘ but when i turned on the system , i could n't believe what i was seeing			0
the playroom is really a children 's game			0
‘ some guy and his girlfriend , i think they were @entity8 because the zoom button was in @entity8 , were naked and going at it like rabbits			1
‘ there were more than 1,000 people watching them have sex , and i would bet that some of those viewers were under 18			2
‘ once you 've signed up for @entity29 , you do n't need to verify your age , so anybody could have been watching it			1
‘ it went on for so long as well , at least 20 minutes			2
it just goes to show that nobody at @entity0 is paying attention to what is being broadcast			2
’ the playroom is a game that comes with every @entity5 console , which allows users to broadcast themselves to other @entity5 users over the internet			1
players can leave comments or send messages to each other , which are shared along with the video stream by a third - party company			2
unexpected content : gamers were shocked to discover that the chatroom function was used to broadcast a live sex session ( stock image ) while the service does require a one - off payment , once that has been set up , there is no filter in place to restrict explicit content			1
the couple , who went by the online handle g12051992 , received more than 150 comments from the thousand people watching their 20 - minute lovemaking session			1
@entity47 said : ‘ there were definitely children watching that			0
people of all ages play consoles , and since there was no age filter , there was no way that that could be avoided			0
‘ it was one of the most watched streams at that time of day			0
the comments were almost as disgusting as the sex			2
‘ the couple were loving it - they kept looking at their tv screen and smiling			2
at one point she adjusted the camera so people could get a better look			0
’ ‘ porn causes harm to all of us , including those who have never seen any , on many levels			0
’ @entity143 , @entity144 mp for @entity145 , who has campaigned for censoring explicit content online , slammed the broadcast			2
she said : ‘ dear @entity149 , this is terrible - and yet another example of why we ca n't be too vigilant			0
’ @entity152 , executive director of @entity154 , agreed , criticizing @entity0 for making such explicit content available , even if the broadcast is moderated by a third party			0
she said : ‘ since the beginning of the internet , severely damaging hardcore pornography has always been accessible to children of all ages			0
‘ certainly , the disturbing live streaming in @entity164 , which is supposed to be a safe game for kids , adds a new layer to what 's already available			0
@entity170 spokesperson @entity169 said : ‘ the @entity5 system is designed to help gamers share their game play through popular social channels			1
it is unfortunate that some individuals may abuse this feature and share inappropriate content			0
he added that within the @entity5 system is a way of setting up parental controls that bans certain people using the console from accessing any user - generated content , such as online messages or video streams			1
he explained that the content being shared by users of the playroom is moderated by @entity192 - based company @entity191			0
just days after the @entity5 was launched last year , one gamer hit the headlines when he stripped his drunk wife during a live - streaming event			1
the man was banned after exposing his wife 's breast before taking off all her clothes in front of thousands of watching gamers .			0
