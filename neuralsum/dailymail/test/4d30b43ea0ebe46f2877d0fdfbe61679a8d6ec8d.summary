@entity0 failed to activate their first option on @entity2 as the deadline passed on thursday night			1
the midnight deadline went by without @entity0 making a formal offer to buy the @entity7 striker outright and they must now take their chances with other suitors if they wish to sign him			2
@entity2 , 26 , has impressed in the last few weeks with five goals in his last six games including the decisive strike against @entity14 in the @entity15 quarter final and two goals in @entity0 's 4 - 2 win at @entity19 last sunday			0
@entity2 is enjoying a fine run of form at @entity0 - scoring three times in his last two games @entity2 ( centre ) returned to training with his @entity0 team - mates on tuesday @entity2 ( second left ) was all smiles in training , but the 26 - year - old faces an uncertain future yet it has followed a largely frustrating season where he has been restricted to just nine starts			1
@entity7 agreed a deal worth around £ 15million last summer which allowed @entity0 to first loan @entity2 for the season then buy him outright before other clubs could bid			2
that exclusivity period passed at midnight though and that will open the door for other clubs to bid			0
the @entity48 international has interest from @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 among others and @entity7 value him at around £ 10million .			0

@entity0 had exclusivity on signing @entity2 until *friday*
other clubs can *swoop* for striker after deadline passed
