@entity1 ’s state - run railway looks poised to take control of @entity6 ’s flagship @entity4 mainline after shares in the two rival @entity6 bidders plummeted amid market speculation of a @entity11 take - over			1
the value of @entity13 fell by £ 150 million , while @entity14 , which has submitted a joint bid with @entity16 , saw £ 33 million wiped off its shares			0
big money in the @entity19 was betting strongly that a bid by @entity22 rail operator @entity21 and sister company @entity23 – both controlled by @entity26 ’s state - owned rail firm @entity25 – is set to win the contract for the route from @entity29 to @entity30			1
if confirmed later this week , the decision is set to provoke outrage among @entity6 rail bosses and unions			1
critics fear it is yet another example of the @entity6 ‘ selling off the family silver ’ to foreign investors			2
@entity1 ’s state - run railway looks set to take control of @entity6 ’s flagship @entity4 mainline , pictured , after shares in two rival @entity6 bidders plummeted rail unions say the sell - off is in any case ‘ a national disgrace ’ and that @entity1 , @entity46 and @entity47 state - owned railways have already made huge inroads into the @entity6 ’s privatised franchises			1
the @entity52 union said this ‘ proves once again that the government are happy to have state control of our main inter-city routes as long as it ’s not the @entity6 state			1
’ the @entity52 recently published research showing that 20 of the @entity6 ’s 27 private rail franchises , the equivalent of 74 per cent , are now owned by foreign state - owned or state - backed railways ‘ with the vast majority being from @entity1 , @entity46 and the @entity47 ’			1
shares in two major @entity6 transport firms which mounted rival bids against the @entity1 both fell sharply yesterday			2
@entity13 bore the brunt of the hit , seeing its share price plummet 10 per cent or 11.6p to 108.2p , wiping nearly £ 150million off its value			0
@entity14 shares were down 1.5per cent to 362.4p , knocking around £ 33million off the share price			0
a spokesman for @entity13 , which runs existing @entity6 franchises including @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 said it does not comment on ‘ market rumours and speculation			2
’ @entity83 also declined to comment ahead of an official announcement			0
@entity22 rail operator @entity21 looks set to win the contract for the route from @entity29 to @entity30 but defeat would mark another bitter disappointment for @entity13 , which was passed over to continue running @entity79 franchise in favour of @entity47 - owed @entity91 , lost out for the @entity93 service as well as the @entity95 operations			1
ironically , the @entity4 line is currently owned by the taxpayer and controlled by the government via a specially established company called @entity100 ( @entity100 ) in @entity101			2
profits go back to the taxpayer rather than to shareholders			0
the state - run @entity4 mainline has generated a bumper £ 1billion windfall for taxpayers over five years since 2009 - prompting unions to brand its sell off back to the private sector as ‘ a national disgrace			1
’ @entity4 paid a record £ 235m back to the government in its final full year as a ‘ nationalised ’ company – up 12 per cent on the previous year			0
@entity52 general secretary @entity115 said : ‘ we are rapidly heading towards a situation where almost the entire train operation in @entity6 is in the hands of overseas companies sucking out profits to benefit their own domestic transport services			2
’ @entity46 ’s state - owned @entity123 is already a big player			1
mr @entity115 added : ‘ it seems you can have state operation of railways in @entity6 as long as it is n’t by the @entity6 state for the benefit of the @entity6 people			1
there must be a full parliamentary inquiry into this appalling racket			0
’ the @entity4 main line has been under the control of the @entity138 since the previous private - sector operator @entity139 pulled out in 2009			0
before that , in 2007 , another private company @entity140 also ceased its @entity4 operation after its parent company @entity143 ran into financial difficulties			0
the government hands over operation of the line in march next year			0
the @entity138 says it has considered value for money , long - term benefits for communities across the route and improved services for passengers and local businesses ‘ and not just the return to the taxpayer			0

a bid by @entity22 operator @entity21 looks set to win the contract for the @entity29 to @entity30 route
it is controlled by @entity26 *'s* state - owned rail firm @entity164
if confirmed , decision is set to provoke outrage among @entity6 rail bosses
