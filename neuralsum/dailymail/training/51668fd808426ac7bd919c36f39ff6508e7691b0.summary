@entity0 - 334 points 2			1
@entity2 - 317 points @entity0 will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season - ending @entity5 on sunday week , even if @entity2 wins the race			1
if the final race was a ‘ normal ’ race with 25 points for the winner , rather than the double points on offer , @entity0 would be able to claim his second drivers ’ title with a sixth - place finish			1
@entity0 was hurtling along the high road of history – or at least the @entity17 , the 200mph back straight at @entity19 – when his car slunk off the track and his world championship bid itself wobbled			1
the upshot was victory at the @entity25 @entity5 for @entity2 , second for @entity0 – and the increased likelihood of the greatest prize in motor racing being decided by the distorted mathematics of double scoring in the final round at @entity33			1
@entity0 ’s lead over @entity2 is a slender 17 points after what unfolded as he arrived off the lightning - quick straight into the fourth turn , @entity36 do @entity40			1
he was screwing every last millisecond out of his @entity42			2
but such pyrotechnical gung - ho was beyond the grip of his battered tyres and he twirled on to the green run - off area			2
he had just put in the then - fastest lap of the race as @entity2 pitted			1
he stayed out for another ‘ hot lap ’ – a mistake in hindsight – in the hope of emerging from his own stop ahead of his rival			0
some number crunchers said he was on target to accomplish the feat but for the spin			0
‘ sorry guys , ’ said @entity0 over the radio			2
he did not point the finger afterwards either , saying : ‘ nobody ’s fault but mine			0
i would have won but for the mistake			0
i clearly had more pace than @entity2 today			2
’ @entity2 celebrates on the podium at the @entity25 @entity5 after claiming his fifth win of the season and first since july 20 @entity2 hurls his trophy into the air as @entity0 is awarded his trophy for second place - the @entity68 now leads @entity2 by 17 points @entity2 locks up in front of second - placed @entity0 during the @entity25 @entity5 as the @entity42 pair tussled until the very end the view from @entity0 's car as he spins off the track on lap 28			1
the incident cost @entity0 six seconds and potentially the race victory @entity0 was trying to gain an advantage on @entity2 , who was in the pits , but pushed too hard and ended up in the run - off area 1 @entity2 ( @entity42 ) 1:30:2.555 2 @entity0 ( @entity42 ) 1:30:4.012 3 @entity85 ( @entity86 ) 1:30:43.586 4 @entity87 ( @entity88 ) 1:30:51.213 5 @entity89 ( @entity90 ) 1:30:53.975 6 @entity91 ( @entity92 ) 1:31:4.461 7 @entity93 ( @entity92 ) 1:31:6.285 8 @entity94 ( @entity95 ) 1:31:6.489 9 @entity96 ( @entity88 ) 1:31:12.640 10 @entity97 ( @entity86 ) +1 lap 11 @entity98 ( @entity99 ) +1 lap 12 pastor @entity100 ( @entity101 ) +1 lap 13 @entity102 ( @entity99 ) +1 lap 14 @entity103 ( @entity104 ) +1 lap 15 @entity105 ( @entity95 ) +1 lap 16 @entity106 ( @entity104 ) +1 lap 17 @entity107 ( @entity101 ) @entity108 , 63 @entity109 18 @entity110 ( @entity90 ) @entity108 , 39 @entity109 it was impossible at the pivotal moment in the race not to think back to @entity114 during his debut season when , with the title at his mercy , he stayed out too long on fading tyres and ran off as he finally entered the pits			1
unlike then , though , he could at least fight on to push the winner all the way			0
@entity2 ’s victory under pressure was his first since july and probably the finest of his career			2
game competitor he is , @entity0 , who was also hampered by a slightly slow second stop , went from about seven seconds adrift after the spin to five seconds back at the halfway stage			2
soon he was right on @entity2 ’s tail			2
this was now a majestic battle over the undulating 2.67 mile track			0
they both posted fastest times			0
@entity2 was blindingly quick but , for lap after lap , in imminent danger from @entity0 applying the @entity139 overtaking device			1
a warning came from the pit wall to @entity142 : ‘ think about protecting that right rear , @entity144			0
it is definitely getting hot			0
’ still , @entity0 loomed large in @entity2 ’s mirror			1
@entity2 celebrates as he 's greeted by the @entity42 team following his win over team - mate @entity0 the tale of two team - mates ; @entity0 must repeat his second placed finish in @entity33 to be sure of denying @entity2 the title @entity0 sprays third - placed @entity85 with champagne as celebrations get into full swing so it came down to the last lap. the tension was excruciating			1
had @entity0 bided his time , and was he now ready to pounce ? it was not to be , and @entity2 duly held on			1
so where does this leave the title ? with @entity165 required , that ’s where			0
but , seriously , if @entity2 wins in the final round in @entity33 a fortnight hence , @entity0 must finish second to claim the title ; if @entity2 is second , @entity0 must finish fifth ; if @entity2 is third , @entity0 must finish sixth			1
@entity42 boss @entity168 , flushed with success after a record - breaking 11 one - two finishes for @entity42 ( beating @entity171 and @entity172 ’s @entity88 best in 1988 ) , has few cares but even he knows the double scoring is a rum do			1
‘ i do hope that it is not decided by a mechanical @entity176 because that would cast a shadow over the championship , ’ @entity168 admitted , before adding : ‘ we all knew the rules at the start of the season , and if @entity2 has most points at the end of the season he will be a worthy champion			1
you have to be pragmatic			0
’ the heat of @entity188 wreaked havoc as teams battled to manage their tyres			2
rain was predicted , but never came another shame is that the final race will be staged in a soulless palace in the desert			1
@entity188 on sunday presented a stark contrast			2
the grid was alive with fever , and it went from there			0
the local favourite arrived to his starting box to chants of ‘ @entity85 , @entity85 ’			2
back at the garage @entity85 ’s father , wearing some @entity206 - lite blue glasses , watched on from the spot where he celebrated his son ’s championship that never was : the race @entity85 won in 2008 only for @entity0 to win the title in the last pulsating yards			1
but sadly for the home contingent their man was given a five - second stop - go penalty for speeding in the pit lane			2
he pulled into the wrong pit box for his third stop and had to be waved into the correct parking space			0
but he was not greatly damaged by the miscalculation and finished third			0
he took to the podium with a wide smile			0
@entity87 was impressive again , finishing fourth to his @entity88 team - mate @entity96 ’s ninth			1
are his bosses getting rid of the wrong man ? will the evidence – @entity87 has scored 106 points against @entity96 ’s 55 – sway them into a change of mind ? ‘ i ’m not ready to stop racing , ’ said @entity87			1
@entity2 leads @entity0 and @entity85 through the opening corners on the first lap of the race the field get off to a clean start in the blazing sun of @entity188 on sunday @entity90 's @entity110 before he was forced to retire from the race on his 40th lap again , the off - track noise was as ear - splitting as the old @entity245 engines			1
the smaller teams – or the uncompetitive ones , as @entity247 calls them – want more money from the sport ’s billion - pound pot. they say they can not survive without it			0
‘ @entity254 said greed was good and look what happened to him – he went to jail , ’ ventured @entity252 of @entity101 , one of the disgruntled teams along with @entity95 and @entity104			0
‘ this is a £ 1.6billion business and teams are going to the wall for the sake of a couple of tens of millions			0
three - car teams ( an idea that is being mooted to replace any teams that withdraw ) will be the death of the championship			0
’ @entity247 laughs in their faces			0
he says they should live within their means			0
he is , of course , the master of making and exploiting mischief			0
what does the argument amount to ? nothing definitive			0
it is a big arm wrestle , positions are being struck , claims are being met by counter claims			0
the fight on the track is more real , and the final chapter of @entity142 versus @entity2 can not come soon enough			1
@entity285 boost for @entity2 as he edges out @entity0			1

@entity2 won the @entity25 @entity5 in @entity188 ahead of team - mate @entity0 after the @entity68 spun
just 17 points separate the @entity42 team - mates going into the final race of the season in @entity33
@entity25 's @entity85 claimed third place in front of his home crowd ahead of @entity87
@entity2 beat @entity42 team - mate @entity0 in every *session* of the weekend in @entity25 before taking pole
