by @entity0 dna testing is taking a bite out of the @entity4 legend			2
after scientists analysed more than 30 hair samples reportedly left behind by @entity4 and similar mythical beasts like the @entity9 , they found all of them came from more mundane creatures like bears , wolves , cows and raccoons			1
in 2012 , researchers at @entity17 and the @entity18 issued an open call asking museums , scientists and @entity4 aficionados to share any samples they thought were from the legendary ape - like creatures			1
bigfoot - or just a cow ? @entity17 genetics professor @entity26 with a dna sample taken from hair from a @entity9 animal			1
his team analyzed more than 30 hair samples reportedly left behind by @entity4 and other related beasts like @entity33 and almasty , they found all of them came from more mundane animals like bears , wolves , cows and raccoons			1
sykes and colleagues tested 36 hair samples from @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48 using dna sequencing and all of them matched dna from known animals			1
most were from bears , but there were also hairs from a @entity56 tapir , horses , porcupine , deer , sheep , and a human			1
' i thought there was about a 5 percent chance of finding a sample from a @entity66 or ( a @entity9 ) , ' said @entity26 of @entity17 , who led the research , the first peer - reviewed study of @entity4 , @entity33 and other ' anomalous primates			2
' the study was published in the journal @entity71 sykes and colleagues tested 36 hair samples from @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48 using dna sequencing and all of them matched dna from known animals			1
most were from bears , but there were also hairs from a @entity56 tapir , horses , porcupine , deer , sheep , and a human			1
while @entity26 said they did n't find any proof of @entity4 - related creatures , he acknowledged their paper does n't prove they do n't exist			0
' the fact that none of these samples turned out to be ( a yeti ) does n't mean the next one wo n't , ' he said			2
the scientists did find two samples from ancient polar bears in the @entity97 , who are not known to live there			1
that suggests there could be a new or hybrid bear species out there , @entity26 said			0
others said proving that @entity4 is real requires significantly more than a mere hair sample			2
researchers say they have not ruled out ever finding bigfoot - and say there may well be undiscovered bear species out there ' i would want visual or physical proof , like a body part , on top of the dna evidence , ' said @entity115 , a professor of anthropology at @entity117			2
he warned @entity4 enthusiasts not to make assumptions when they find weird things in the forest			0
' every mammal in the forest leaves hair and poop behind and that 's what we 've found , ' he said			0
' just not the big guy himself			0
' some experts said that if @entity4 existed , there would be a lot more to find than just a few errant hairs			0
' those who believe in the @entity9 , @entity4 and the @entity134 need basic instruction in sex , ' said @entity137 , an ecologist at @entity138 , in an email			0
' @entity33 has two parents , four grandparents and so on , ' he said			0
' there should have been herds of ( @entity144 ) , ' he wrote			0
' where were they hiding ''			0

@entity17 tested 36 hair samples from @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and the @entity48
all of them matched dna from known animals *including* a tapir , horses , porcupine , deer , sheep , and a human
two samples from ancient polar bears in the @entity97 , who are not known to live there
