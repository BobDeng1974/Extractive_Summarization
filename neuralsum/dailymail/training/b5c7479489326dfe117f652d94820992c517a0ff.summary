@entity0 built a legendary empire before his untimely - and mysterious - death at the age of just 32 in 323 bc. some historians argued was death was due to natural causes , while others maintained he was secretly murdered at a celebratory banquet			1
now , an @entity12 scientist may have unraveled the case some 2000 years later			2
@entity15 toxicologist dr @entity14 thinks the culprit could be poisonous wine made from an innocuous - looking plant , according to a report in the @entity20			0
death by wine ? new findings , which are ten years in the making , suggest that @entity0 died from drinking wine that was tainted with a seemingly innocuous plant called hellebore pretty but deadly : veratrum album , known as white hellebore , is a plant that , once fermented properly , can be lethal dr @entity14 , who has been researching the toxicological evidence for a decade , said some of the poisoning theories - including arsenic and strychnine - were not plausible			1
death would have come far too fast , he said			0
his research , co-authored by @entity12 classics expert dr @entity39 and published in the medical journal @entity41 , found the most plausible culprit was @entity44 album , known as white hellebore			0
the white - flowered plant , which can be fermented into a poisonous wine , was well - known to the @entity48 as a herbal treatment for inducing vomiting			1
crucially , it could have accounted for the 12 torturous days that @entity0 took to die , speechless and unable to walk			1
the new theory behind the death of @entity0 started here , at the @entity12 in @entity55 other suggested poisons - including hemlock , aconite , wormwood , henbane and autumn crocus - would likely have killed him far more quickly			1
dr @entity14 began looking into the mystery in 2003 when he was approached by a company working on a @entity66 documentary			0
' they asked me to look into it for them and i said , ' oh yeah , i 'll give it a go , i like a challenge ' - thinking i was n't going to find anything , ' he said			0
' and to my utter surprise , and their surprise , we found something that could fit the bill			0
' dr @entity14 's theory was that @entity44 album could have been fermented as a wine that was given to the leader			2
dr @entity14 , toxicologist at the @entity15 and scientist at the @entity12 in @entity55 , thinks a poisonous wine made from a plant may have killed @entity0 it would have tasted ' very bitter ' but it could have been sweetened - and @entity0 was likely to have been very drunk at the banquet			1
but whether @entity0 was poisoned is still a mystery			2
we 'll never know really , ' dr @entity14 concluded .			0

@entity0 died in 323 bc at the age of 32
his death has been a point of mystery , with *numerous* theories as to what caused it
what is known is that he suffered for 12 days before dying
a new theory from the @entity12 in @entity55 claims his wine had been *spiked* with a plant that , when fermented , is *incredibly* deadly
