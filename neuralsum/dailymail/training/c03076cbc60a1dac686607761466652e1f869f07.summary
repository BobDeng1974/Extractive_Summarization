@entity0 said there is no place for ' rotten boroughs ' as he used emergency powers to take control of a @entity7 council following a damning report into its finance and administration			1
the communities secretary said there was a ' culture of cronyism ' at @entity15 , which has faced accusations around the mis - selling of assets including @entity19 and claims about the allocation of £ 400,000 of grant funding			1
mr @entity0 also told @entity23 that ' executive power is unchecked and executive power has been misused ' at the @entity7 authority , and said he would be appointing three troubleshooters to the council , who will report directly to him			1
damning : @entity0 ( left ) said there is no place for ' rotten boroughs ' as he used emergency powers to take control of @entity15 , where @entity34 ( right ) is mayor , following a damning report into its finance and administration he has written to the council seeking representations on his plans , which involve the three commissioners being appointed and reporting back every six months on an action plan to resolve the problems identified by @entity44 ( @entity44 )			1
the report found grants were awarded to organisations ' ruled ineligible ' , and £ 407,700 given to groups that failed to meet the council ’s own minimum criteria , with council officers who objected often over-ruled			1
@entity52 listed @entity53 was sold for £ 875,000 to one of the council 's mayor @entity34 's political supporters , even though the bid had arrived late , and after rival bids , including a higher offer , had been opened , ' creating a risk of bid manipulation ' , according to the report			1
the report and action by mr @entity0 comes after claims that grants were awarded to @entity68 groups linked to supporters of mr @entity34			1
mr @entity34 has also faced claims of fraud over the last 12 months and sparked a protest after he raised the @entity74 flag over the town hall ‘ in solidarity with @entity77 ’			2
the raising of the flag came in july , barely 24 hours after it emerged that he was to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud			0
people were allegedly promised council houses if they backed him and @entity85 voters were told they should be ‘ good @entity86 ’ and support him			0
his supporters were accused of doctoring ballot papers , manipulating postal voting and sabotaging the chances of his main rival , @entity93 candidate @entity92 , by branding him racist and @entity94			0
sold : @entity52 listed @entity53 was sold for £ 875,000 to one of the council 's mayor @entity34 's political supporters , even though the bid had arrived late , and after rival bids mr @entity34 was a member of the @entity99 and was its candidate to be the first directly elected mayor of the borough in 2010			1
but he was expelled from the @entity93 after allegations surfaced about his close links with an @entity85 extremist group called the @entity107			0
he was accused of using illegal tactics to win the mayoral election in @entity110 in may			0
but , in a statement released ahead of mr @entity0 ' statement to mps , independent mr @entity34 , said allegations of fraud had been rejected by the @entity44 report			1
however , mr @entity0 told @entity23 : ' ( the report ) paints a deeply concerning picture of obfuscation , denial , secrecy , the breakdown of democratic scrutiny and accountability , and a culture of cronyism risking the corrupt spending of public funds			1
' he added : ' i am satisfied the council is failing to comply with its best value duty , therefore i need to consider exercising my powers of intervention to secure compliance with the duty			0
' i am writing to the council asking them to make representations , if they wish , both to the @entity44 report and to an intervention package i am proposing			2
this proposed package will need to do three things			0
' mr @entity0 said this would include ending council activities not compatible with best value duties , remove the risk of any further failures and finally to rebuild governance and financial management at the council			1
he said a key problem was senior positions , head of paid service , the chief financial officer and the monitoring officer , being staffed only on an interim basis			0
reply : in response to the report , mr @entity34 said it had not found evidence of fraud , and said the council would learn from the report and ' strengthen our procedures accordingly ' ' my proposed intervention is centred on putting in place a team of three commissioners who will be appointed and be accountable to me , ' said the secretary of state			2
' their role will be to oversee or as appropriate exercise certain functions of the council ... i envisage commissioners will be in place until march 31 , 2017			0
' to help me assess the progress , i am proposing that within three months of launching the intervention the council will , with the commissioners , draw up and agree an action plan to secure the council 's future compliance with best value duty			2
' the commissioners will report to me on six monthly intervals on progress being made			2
' on grants awarded by the council , mr @entity0 said : ' @entity44 found the mayoral administration grants programme handed out taxpayers ' money with no apparent rationale to the grants awarded			1
' there were no objectives , fair or transparent approach to grants , which a council 's so - called corporate grants programme board was supposed to ensure			2
' there was no proper monitoring - grants were systematically made without transparency			0
across mainstream grants , 81 per cent of all officer recommendations were rejected			0
' over £ 400,000 was given to bodies which failed the minimum criteria to be awarded anything at all			0
' turning to land disposals , mr @entity0 also outlined how properties were sold to third parties ' without proper process '			2
mr @entity0 said the council had 14 days to make representations on the report and his proposed intervention package			1
solution : mr @entity0 told @entity23 that ' executive power is unchecked and executive power has been misused ' at the council , and said he would be appointing three troubleshooters to the council , who will report directly to him the report , he said , which cost just under £ 1 million would be borne by the council , adding : ' it would have been much cheaper had the mayoral administration had not been so obstructive			1
' there was no place for ' rotten boroughs ' in 21st century @entity229 , mr @entity0 added			2
mr @entity0 said a copy of the report would be sent to the police for their information , he added : ' if i was the mayor of @entity110 i would be holding my head in shame , because what he 's allowed to occur in @entity110 is shameful , not that i 've made a final decision			1
' in response to the report , mr @entity34 said it had not found evidence of fraud			0
' in april 2014 , @entity0 announced that he was concerned about potential fraud and the @entity246 ran these claims on its front page , ' the mayor said in a statement released before mr @entity0 ' remarks in the @entity252 ,			2
' these allegations have been rejected by @entity44			0
the report highlights flaws in processes			0
' we will learn from this report and strengthen our procedures accordingly			0
' i was always confident wild claims about fraud would not be substantiated			0
' both my officers and i want to get on with our jobs serving all residents in @entity110			0
' a @entity15 spokeswoman , also speaking before mr @entity0 , said : ' we urge the secretary of state to act proportionately and to acknowledge the steps we have already taken to tighten up processes as well as the high performing nature of the council 's services			1
' during questions from mps , shadow secretary of state for communities and local government @entity274 said mr @entity0 was ' clearly right ' to exercise the powers granted to him under the @entity279 1999 .			1
