when it comes to teaching children about manners , safety or even sex , most parents do n't hesitate in making sure their offspring have a good understanding ( no matter how awkward they may find it )			1
however , despite the huge importance placed on financial education , more than half of @entity11 parents admit they find it difficult to talk to their kids about money , and are avoiding the topic for as long as possible			1
a report from the government ’s @entity19 found parents are simply leaving it too late , claiming children start forming money habits from as young as seven , whereas mums and dads leave discussing savings from around nine			1
financial education truly begins at home , so what can parents do to help their children get to grips with finance ? here , financial journalist and founder of blog @entity56 @entity53 reveals her top seven tips			1
start young start talking to your child about money from as early an age as possible – five is not too young			1
it 's important for parents to make the lesson appropriate for their child 's age			0
with a son or a daughter who is five years old , mums and dads can start talking to them about different types of coins and let them pay for things when out shopping , so they get used to handling money , or play shops with them at home using pretend cash			2
open a savings account opening a dedicated savings account for your child is great way to show them how their money can grow , and can also help start conversations about how long it may take to reach a certain amount of money			0
it will also start to teach them the very basics on investments and savings			0
let them make mistakes it is important to give your children an allowance and let them use it as they choose			0
yes , they may well make what you consider to be the wrong choice , but they will learn from those mistakes , which is important for their financial learning curve			0
it is better for them learn from small amounts now at a young age , rather than bigger amounts when they are older when the consequences would be far more serious			0
be confident parents should remember when teaching their children about money , that they are helping them to learn a lifelong skill - so confidence is a must			1
some mums and dads are afraid to broach the subject , uncertain that they will be saying the right things , or feeling out of their depth			0
it 's important to start with the basics , and remember that any glimpse into handling financial matters that parents can offer their children will stand them in good stead for the future			2

pay for chores rewarding children for work around the house is the perfect way to teach them about earning money			2
whether it 's doing the washing up , washing the car or tidying their room , giving them a little cash for them to save or spend as they wish will introduce them to the working world			0
parents could also ask their children to think about and work out how many times they would have to , say , wash the car to pay for the @entity161 they so want , so they are familiar with the value of money			1
make it gradual parents should introduce their child 's financial education gradually - if mums and dads have n't spoken before about savings and how to use money , do n't jump in with one long chat , as it will become boring and feel like a chore to them			1
introduce it gradually , making it a fun thing rather than a serious lesson , and make sure it 's ongoing , developing your child 's awareness as their familiarity with money grows			0
be consistent although most parents give their children a sum of pocket money , only 36 per cent of mums and dads say they do so on a regular basis			1
being irregular and offering varied amounts can actually make it harder for children to learn about budgeting			0
for parents giving their child pocket money , do so on the same day , with the same amount , and discuss with them , in a lighthearted way , what they can buy with that money , or what happens when they pop it into their piggy bank - the amount they have doubles by the following installment			2
according to child psychologist dr @entity208 , it can be ' very empowering ' to give your children skills and confidence with money , so that they do n't have to face money worries in the future			2
