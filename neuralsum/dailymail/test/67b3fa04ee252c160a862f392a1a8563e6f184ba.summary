dogs can sniff out prostate cancer with 98 per cent reliability , a new study has shown			1
the research , carried out in @entity5 , backs up tests carried out by the charity @entity7			1
its co-founder dr @entity8 said the charity 's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer			1
she hailed the new study , describing the findings as ' spectacular '			2
dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men 's urine samples the latest research , by the @entity22 at the @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity5 , involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without			1
scientists found that dog one got it right in 98.7 per cent of cases , while for dog two this was 97.6 per cent			2
they said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice			1
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the @entity46 , with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year			1
dr @entity8 said : ' these results are spectacular			0
they offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer			2
' it is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer , for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate			1
' she said there is currently a ' reluctance to embrace this tested , time - old technology ' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts			0
there is no single test for prostate cancer , but the most commonly used are blood tests , a physical examination or a biopsy			2
the latest research , by the @entity22 at the @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity5 , involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without prostate cancer , pictured , is the most common cancer in men in the @entity46 , with more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year ' over the years , millions of pounds of @entity88 funding has been poured into the traditional test methods , and yet there has been little improvement in their reliability , ' dr @entity8 added			1
' this has caused a huge waste of resources , not to mention the distress to the impacted individuals			0
' moreover , the detection dogs provide alternative solution that yields consistently accurate results			0
if our detection dogs were a machine , there would be huge demand for them			0
' medical detection dogs , which is based in @entity109 , trains specialist canines to detect the odour of human disease			0
they also train @entity115 dogs to help people with life - threatening health conditions go about their daily lives			0
the research is published in the @entity120 .			0

study in @entity5 found two dogs *identified* 98 *%* of prostate cancer cases
they examined urine samples of 900 men - 360 who had cancer
@entity7 charity hailed the study as ' spectacular '
