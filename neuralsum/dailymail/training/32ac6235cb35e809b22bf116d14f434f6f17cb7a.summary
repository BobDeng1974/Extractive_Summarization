by @entity0 published : 04:37 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 04:37 est , 26 october 2012 good for you ? experts say the potential for interactions between supplements and prescription drugs is substantial taking herbal or dietary supplements like echinacea , calcium or iron alongside prescription drugs could cause adverse side effects , as study warned			1
other remedies such as @entity15 , flaxseed , magnesium or ginkgo could also be bad for you when mixed with these medicines , it is believed			2
the research suggest combining the popular alternative remedies may cause mild - to - severe heart problems , chest pain , abdominal pain and headache , particularly among people receiving medication for problems with their central nervous or cardiovascular systems			1
those taking @entity32 , insulin , aspirin , digoxin and ticlopidine had the greatest number of reported adverse interactions with the remedies or supplements			1
combining the two affects the process by which some types of drugs are absorbed , distributed , metabolised and eliminated by the body , the study warned			2
yet scientists said the findings may just be the tip of the iceberg and said people needed to be aware of the health risks involved			1
but it pointed out herbal and botanical remedies were more likely to have adverse effects than the other dietary supplements , such as vitamins , minerals and amino acids			1
emeritus professor @entity59 from the @entity60 said : ' survey after survey shows that large proportions of the population are trying ' natural ' remedies for illness - prevention , all sorts of ailments , diseases or for states of reduced well - being			1
' most experts therefore agree that the potential for such interactions is substantial			0
despite this consensus and despite the considerable amount of documented harm generated by such interactions , our current knowledge is still woefully incomplete			0
' the number of interactions between herbal and dietary supplements and prescribed drugs could be under - reported and just the tip of the iceberg , he added			1

he said : ' patients deserve reliable information , and it is our duty to provide it			0
we have to become vigilant and finally agree to monitor this sector adequately			0
' each individual doctor can contribute to this process by routinely including questions about alternative medicine use in their medical history taking			0
' the study was carried out by dr @entity107 from the @entity108 in @entity109 who said : ' consumer use of herbal and dietary supplements has risen dramatically over the past two decades			2
' in the @entity115 , for example , it is estimated that more than 50 per cent of patients with chronic diseases or cancer use them and that many patients take them at the same time as prescribed medication			0
' despite their widespread use , the potential risks associated with combining herbal and dietary supplements with other medications , which include mild - to - severe heart problems , chest pain , abdominal pain and headache , are poorly understood			1
' the study looked at previous research into 213 herbal and dietary supplements entities and 509 prescribed medications and compared the 882 incidents of adverse reactions			2
more than 42 per cent of the drug interactions were caused by the herbal and dietary supplements altered the pharmacokinetics of the prescribed drugs - the process by which a drug is absorbed , distributed , metabolised and eliminated by the body			1
just over 26 per cent of the total were described as major @entity144 the 152 identified contraindications , the most frequent involved the gastrointestinal system ( 16.4 per cent ) and neurological system ( 14.5 per cent )			0
flaxseed , echinacea and yohimbe had the largest number of documented contraindications			0
dr @entity107 said : ' our extensive review clearly shows that some herbal and dietary supplements ingredients have potentially harmful drug interactions that are predominately moderate in their severity			0
' it also showed that herbal and botanical remedies were more likely to have documented drug interactions and contraindications than the other dietary supplements , such as vitamins , minerals and amino acids			1
' the findings are published in the @entity169 .			0

herbal and botanical remedies were more likely to react badly with prescription drugs than vitamins
interaction side - effects include mild - to - severe heart problems , chest pain , abdominal pain and headache
