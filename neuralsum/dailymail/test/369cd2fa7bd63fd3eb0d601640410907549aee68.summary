@entity1 - @entity0 @entity2 @entity4 - @entity3 @entity2 @entity6 arrived with a bang in @entity8 and while races in recent seasons have n't quite had the same excitement seen during its early years , there is enough substance for it to be an intriguing watch on race day			1
for instance whether the @entity16 is held as a potential title decider late on in the year ( 2004 - 2008 ) or as an early opener ( 2009 - present ) it can often be hit with outside variables ; wet conditions often sprinkling some unpredictability over a weekend			1
the track layout is also a challenging design			0
@entity24 ensures he gets his long straight and hairpin turn in , but it flows like @entity3 and offers great reward for getting the line through the sequence of fast turns spot on , in the middle of the lap especially			0
a decent run out on to the back straight is a catalyst for the classic trademark move going into the penultimate corner			0
even the pit lanes can be challenging ( you 'll see if you scroll down ) which brings us nicely on to the latest in @entity43 's series of @entity2 memories ... the @entity6 circuit held the inaugural @entity16 in 2004 and has been home to the event ever since			1
here is a picture shortly before its first race , with the grandstand and pit straight seen towards the back			0
it sure seems a long walk from the huge car park ... @entity57 featured late on in the 2004 season , and is pictured in his @entity59 during qualifying with the main grandstand in the background			2
the @entity62 had replaced the sacked @entity63 but this would be his penultimate race start in @entity8 having been dropped by @entity67 for 2004 , there was plenty of attention on @entity70 when he returned to the @entity8 grid for the @entity16			1
in his traditional baggy overalls , the 1997 world champion poses with team boss @entity74 having joined @entity75 for the final three races of the season following the team 's dismissal of @entity80 the cameras are all on @entity82 as he emerges from the garage for his first @entity75 run , but the gamble to hire the @entity86 backfired as he failed to score a single point for the team who would lose out to @entity67 in the fight for second in the constructors ' championship what 's up , @entity95 ? ! @entity97 's @entity96 , @entity59 's @entity98 and @entity67 's @entity99 all take a moment to wave to the @entity6 crowd in 2004 , but @entity102 looks far from amused with his shades on and a glum looking face to match given the dominance of @entity106 at the time , very few would have guessed that @entity109 's 2004 win would be his last for the team			1
at least he looks like he is making the most of it as he celebrates with @entity113 , with the @entity114 finishing third behind @entity115 in a totally bizarre incident , @entity116 steps out his wreck of a @entity106 which rests on the side of the track			0
the @entity122 collided with @entity124 ' @entity123 while driving out the pit - lane to the grid before the start of the 2005 race - both would compete in a spare car it 's all smiles at @entity75 as they celebrate clinching the constructors ' title in the last race of the 2005 season ahead of @entity135			1
it capped off a perfect year for the team with @entity102 ( centre ) becoming world champion and @entity140 ( holding trophy aloft ) proving a capable rear gunner as they recaptured success not seen since the team 's previous incarnation as @entity147 in 1995 the 2005 race in @entity6 also proved to be the end of an era as the popular underdogs @entity123 raced for the final time			1
team boss @entity153 proudly holds off a pit board showing their record of 340 races since 1985 alongside team staff and drivers @entity160 ( left ) and @entity124			0
thankfully the team remained in the sport and survive to this day in its current guise as @entity164 it was n't just @entity123 departing in 2005 as @entity166 would also race for the final time before becoming @entity168			0
but @entity169 would only last 28 laps before an accident ended his race			0
here , race winner @entity102 zips past in his @entity75 , with the @entity175 driver seen in his yellow overalls observing the wreckage on the opposite side of the track @entity6 in 2006 provided one of its most dramatic races			1
@entity102 was in control before his decision to pit for scrubbed front intermediate tyres would come back to haunt him			2
the @entity185 was in a title fight with @entity116 who , in the background , quickly caught the struggling @entity75			0
@entity188 tries to provide a protective barrier to his team - mate , but so slow was @entity102 that even the @entity191 had to pass him - with @entity116 soon following schumcaher would also go on to pass @entity140 and claim a very famous victory which saw the title race swing dramatically in the favour of the @entity106 star			2
the agony and ecstasy from the @entity75 and @entity106 drivers on the podium tells its own story with @entity102 and @entity140 looking devastated and puzzled at how they lost the race with his @entity106 team right behind him , @entity116 celebrates his unlikely win in parc ferme			0
the @entity122 's record in the @entity16 was otherwise poor this race aside , but his famous 2006 victory would be his 91st and final @entity2 victory in his career just when you thought 2006 could n't be beaten , the following year 's grand prix served up one of the pivotal moments of the 2007 season			2
rookie @entity217 tried to drag a set of beaten up intermediate tyres as long as he could around the circuit and did the hard bit by staying on the road			2
but when coming to pit in for new rubber , he somehow beached his @entity135 in a gravel trap			0
here the @entity225 reacts to a horrendous error with a marshall offering assistance			0
the right rear tyre shows just how little rubber was left on his tyre as he pitted in a double blow for @entity217 , it was title rival @entity113 who would benefit as the @entity106 star would go on to win the race and eventually the championship later on in the season by just one point			2
the @entity114 is shown a board to let him know he is starting his final lap but @entity217 would bounce back in 2008 as he sussed out the correct route to the pit - lane and in doing so found the key to grabbing victory			2
here , the @entity135 driver celebrates his win with his mother @entity246 and his step mother @entity247 in parc ferme @entity249 and seek @entity8 style ? no , it 's just @entity252 trying to push his @entity253 out of the tyre barrier following a crash during saturday practice ahead of the 2009 race get out of the spray ! as the safety car prepares to come in during 2009 , @entity259 leads the pack in his @entity262 with team - mate @entity96 , the @entity263 of @entity109 and @entity115 , and the @entity59 of @entity80 seeking a line on the track where they are not blinded by spray on a wet afternoon in @entity6 @entity268 would prove no problem for @entity259 , who punches the air with delight after securing @entity262 's first ever win in 2009 much to the joy of team members on the pit wall			1
the race was the first year in which the grand prix was hosted earlier in the season where it remains @entity280 suffered a terrifying crash just shy of 200mph during the first practice session ahead of the 2010 event , as flying down the long back straight both of his front wheels simultaneously broke off leaving him without any steering and just rear brakes to stop			0
thankfully a large run off area and a gravel trap left him enough room to significantly reduce his speed before he slid along a barrier coming to a safe stop two fantastic drivers of their respective generations duel at the hairpin on the back straight , but sadly the best of @entity116 ( left ) had long since passed as @entity135 's @entity217 prepares to drive round the outside of the @entity304 star in 2010 but it was @entity217 's team - mate @entity115 who would claim 2010 victory - with the duo exchanging a warm hand - shake on the podium @entity217 was shaking more hands a year later but this time it was as the grand prix winner , as @entity262 's @entity96 , who finished third , greets the @entity135 driver in parc ferme after the race			1
the triumph made @entity217 the first multi-time winner at @entity6 @entity252 leads the pack out of the first twisty opening section in front of @entity304 team - mate @entity116 as @entity135 's @entity115 follows in third			1
@entity252 would go on to win the 2012 race which would be his first in his @entity8 career @entity304 team members rush to the pit - wall to greet @entity252 on his victory , which was the first for the team since 1955			1
@entity304 had only re-entered @entity8 as a team again in 2010 after taking over from the one - season wonders @entity329 - who had previously been @entity330 @entity102 leads the celebrations as he holds a @entity106 flag in front of his delighted team following his 2013 win			1
the @entity185 looked like he could lead a @entity106 title fight following this victory , but he has only won one grand prix since			0
can you name where and when it was ? ( @entity342 is at the bottom of the page ) the story of 2014 ? the trophies piled up for @entity304 last year and the @entity6 result reflected the story of the championship as @entity217 kept @entity252 at arm 's length to lead home a one - two triumph for the team in the @entity16 2004 : @entity109 ( @entity106 ) 2005 : @entity102 ( @entity75 ) 2006 : @entity116 ( @entity106 ) 2007 : @entity113 ( @entity106 ) 2008 : @entity217 ( @entity135 ) 2009 : @entity259 ( @entity262 ) 2010 : @entity115 ( @entity135 ) 2011 : @entity217 ( @entity135 ) 2012 : @entity252 ( @entity304 ) 2013 : @entity102 ( @entity106 ) 2014 : @entity217 ( @entity304 ) bold indicates driver still active on @entity8 grid quiz answer - where and when was @entity102 's last @entity2 victory ? @entity360 , @entity361 ( 2013 )			1
