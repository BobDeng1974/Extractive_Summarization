' @entity17 , ha , ha ' : @entity4 laughed off the idea that he wo n't be back as speaker next year , disappointing some tea partiers who would rather see one of their own in charge @entity29 , @entity7 is a luxury community with water as far as the eye can see -- and real estate prices that rival @entity41 fancy a swim ? the @entity45 has you covered , even though the beach is just a few steps away he plunked down $ 185,000 as a down payment and took out a $ 650,000 mortgage for the rest , according to public records			1
but his @entity9 fundraisers are still racking up record numbers , a @entity4 campaign aide told @entity56 , and he 's planning to campaign as hard has ever – much to the dismay of some conservatives who see him as too soft			1

he filed for reelection in @entity9 's @entity69 on december 9			2

@entity84 and surf : @entity29 is a rich man 's playground , a far cry from @entity4 's image as a @entity91 - bred everyman @entity4 and his wife finalized the deed to their fourth - floor digs at @entity45 on february 11 paradise : @entity4 's vacation property is ringed with palm trees , and his condo includes a personal whirlpool bath ' this area of @entity7 has been the @entity104 ' family vacation spot for many years , and rather than continue to put money into vacation rentals year after year , they decided to buy a condo , ' he said in a statement			1
' their home is in @entity110 , @entity9 , and will continue to be			0
' the always - tan @entity4 is known for his teary emotional moments but had only chuckles when the subject of his retirement came up @entity4 , 64 , has become more of a polarizing figure than most observers expected him to be when he took the speaker 's gavel in 2011			0
he has tussled with tea partiers and other conservatives in his caucus over @entity121 , federal budget items , immigration , and last year 's ill - fated partial government shutdown			1
but the perennially orange - hued @entity9 appears to be in @entity24 for the long haul , occupying a basement apartment in the @entity69 that he rents – in you - ca n't - make - this - up fashion – from a tanning lobbyist			0
the pricey @entity7 condo now in the @entity4 family is in a 14 - story building surrounded by beachfront property			2
