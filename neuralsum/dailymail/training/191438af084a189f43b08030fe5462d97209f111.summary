the @entity0 has ruled in favor of same sex marriage by striking down the @entity3 in a landmark 5 - 4 decision this morning			1
it followed that decision with a ruling against @entity10 's controversial @entity9 , which banned same - sex marriage in the state , meaning that gay marriage will inevitably be deemed legal in @entity10			1
by striking down @entity3 , the @entity0 ruled that it was not legal to prevent same - sex spouses from receiving the same benefits that heterosexual couples receive			1
the legal drama in @entity10 came when the state approved same - sex marriage , and that was followed months later with a prop 8 , which was put in place by the 9th @entity42			1
prop 8 banned same - sex marriage across the state , and today , the @entity0 ruled that the 9th @entity42 was overstepping their bounds by putting the ban in place in the first place			1
though the legal wrangling will undoubtedly continue in the coming months , the ruling suggests that @entity10 will go back to allowing same - sex marriage			1
if that is the case , it will be the 13th state to legally allow same - sex marriage			2
the plaintiffs in the @entity9 case were two same - sex couples from @entity10			1
during their celebratory interviews on the steps of the @entity0 , one of the women received a phone call from president @entity57 personally congratulating them on their victory			0
while it does not theoretically change the fact that only 12 states and the @entity62 are the only areas in the @entity21 where same - sex marriages are granted , today 's ruling means that any couples who are married in those states have to be treated the same as any heterosexual married couples under the law across the country			1
the broadly - written decision says among other privileges , same - sex couples can now file joint tax returns , are entitled to social security survivor benefits , have the right to make medical decisions for incapacitated partners , and will receive notification when a spouse is killed in action			1
justice @entity82 wrote the majority decision , saying that it was not legal to consider same - sex marriages anything lesser than full legal partnerships			2
' under @entity3 , same - sex married couples have their lives burdened , by reason of government decree , in visible and public ways , ' @entity82 wrote in the majority decision			1
' @entity3 's principal effect is to identify a subset of state - sanctioned marriages and make them unequal			2
' he wrote that the previous law caused ' a stigma upon all who enter into same - sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the states			2
' as was expected , the court 's four more conservative justices - @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , and chief justice @entity111 - voted against the issue			0
president @entity57 is currently in @entity113 on a state visit to @entity115 , @entity113 and @entity116 , but he tweeted shortly after the decision was reached			0
big day : the ruling over the @entity3 was one of the most hotly - anticipated verdicts celebrating : @entity121 of @entity122 jumps for joy after the @entity3 was struck down , meaning that same - sex partners will receive equal benefits ' today 's @entity3 ruling is a historic step forward for @entity131 , ' his official @entity127 account released			1
he was expected to make a statement about the two rulings , and his words will have an added twist as he will give them in @entity115 , where homosexuality is illegal			0
the second ruling of the day came on the issue of @entity9			0
in that case , @entity10 had passed same - sex marriage but then @entity9 was put in place banning gay marriage in the state			1
today 's @entity0 decision said that @entity9 was not legal , and they were not legally able to put that ban into place			0
by removing the ban , @entity10 is now the 13th state that allows same - sex marriage			1
the landmark decision comes on a busy week for the highest court in the land , as they already handed down verdicts on similarly controversial decisions on affirmative action , the voting rights act , and a custody battle between a girl 's @entity157 biological father and her adoptive family			0
crowds gathered outside of the court on wednesday morning ahead of their 10am announcement			0
on the call : the @entity163 released this picture of president @entity57 calling @entity165 from @entity166 waiting to hear : the court was ruling on two different cases that would decide whether gay couples are legally allowed to marry across the country right now , 12 states and the @entity62 recognize same - sex marriages as legal , and it is likely that the issue will still continue to be determined on a state - by - state basis			1
the case itself was based around the constitutionality of denying spousal benefits to same sex @entity180 are also considering the validity of the @entity10 ban on same - sex marriage			1
named the @entity21 v. @entity165 , the case was filed by an elderly lesbian named @entity165			0
she was married to her female spouse @entity165 but was denied estate tax when ms @entity190 died			2
their 40 - year love story has been a well - publicized one and a movie was made to nationalize			0
in light of today 's landmark ruling , @entity165 no longer has to pay the @entity197 hundreds of dollars that she was told to pay because the federal government did not recognize her same - sex marriage as valid			1
@entity165 thanked her friends and attorneys at a press conference after the ruling @entity165 challenged the federal @entity3 after she was made to pay $ 363,000 in inheritance taxes , after her partner of 44 years @entity165 died			2
a heterosexual would not have faced the punitive bill			0
she seemed hopeful after she testified in front of the court in march , and today she is undoubtedly celebrating			0
' they were direct , they asked all the right questions , ' she said after exiting the hearing in late march			0
' i did n't feel any hostility or any sense of inferiority ... i felt we were very respected and i think it 's gon na be good , ' she added with a smile			0
two years after they were married , @entity190 , a long - suffering multiple sclerosis patient , passed away			2
@entity165 explained how weeks later she suffered a real life ' broken heart , ' when she was struck down with a heart - attack			0
she was then hit with the massive tax bill			0
' in the midst of my grief , i realized the federal government was treating us as strangers , ' she said			0
as such , the widow challenged the @entity3 and when lower courts agreed that the @entity3 discriminatory and unconstitutional , the case was handed to the @entity0 to make a final determination			0
the 1996 @entity21 law denies married same - sex couples access to federal benefits by defining marriage as between a man and a woman			1
@entity82 referred to @entity3 as " inconsistent " because it purports to give authority to the states to define marriage while limiting recognition of those determinations			2

@entity3 was struck down meaning that married same - sex couples have to receive the same benefits as heterosexual married couples
the ruling has substantial effects when it comes to issues like survivors benefits and tax filings for married same - sex couples
same - sex marriage is only legal in 12 states and the @entity62
@entity10 now added to that list as prop 8 also dismissed
