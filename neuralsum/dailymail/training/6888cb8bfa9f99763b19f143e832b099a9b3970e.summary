@entity1 manager @entity0 has accused television of adding to @entity4 's misery at @entity5 on monday night , claiming there was an agenda against the under - fire @entity9 boss			1
@entity4 will be in the spotlight at @entity1 again on saturday with @entity9 one place off the bottom of the @entity13 and his job said to be still very much in the balance			1
the @entity9 manager 's job prospects looked bleak after monday 's 1 - 0 defeat to the @entity20 , but @entity4 remains in charge for the trip to south @entity23 and @entity1 counterpart @entity0 admitted he felt sympathy for him while watching the game on television at home			1
@entity4 has endured a torrid time of late but @entity1 boss @entity0 has backed the @entity9 gaffer @entity0 believes the television coverage of @entity9 's defeat by @entity5 was not fair to @entity4 ' i do n't like seeing the agenda in the televised game at @entity5 the other night , ' @entity0 said			1
' every time there was a bad mistake or some sort of attack against @entity9 they 'd pan to the manager and the chairman			2
' it was a bit of a farce for me and i thought there was an agenda behind it			0
' but @entity4 's an experienced manager , he 's in a difficult moment and he 's been through the mill but he 's a very good manager			1
' he 's got a very talented squad of players and it 's a case of pulling together as quickly as possible and move on			0
@entity9 supporters held numerous banners calling for @entity4 to be sacked during the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity5 ' you have sympathy with all managers in those situations but with the players they have they 'll fight and scrap for every point and i think they 'll do well this season			1
' @entity1 were boosted on thursday by @entity64 being called into the @entity66 squad for the forthcoming @entity68 qualifiers against @entity69 and @entity70 , the 22 - year - old midfielder having won his solitary cap two years ago while he was a @entity72 player			2
@entity64 's inclusion marks the first time that a player has been named in an @entity66 squad while representing @entity1 , and @entity0 said it was a huge boost for the club even if highly - rated wide men @entity79 and @entity80 missed out on a place in @entity83 's squad			1
@entity85 owner @entity84 reportedly told a journalist @entity4 would be sacked if @entity9 lost at @entity5 ' it 's excellent news for the player and for the club , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's a great example , a way of showing a pathway to international teams			0
' we have a lot of international players but in terms of @entity66 it 's a pathway for others here			0
' we 've worked hard with @entity64 , how he can contribute and improve and he 's making a conscious effort to do that			0
' he 's not quite all the way there yet but he 's improving and this will give him another boost in confidence			0
@entity0 hailed midfielder @entity64 , who was called up to the @entity66 squad by @entity83 on thursday ' his quality is there for everyone to see - his passing , the way he moves the ball , how he offers good angles and movements and fits into a defensive shape			2
' i hope it opens the door for others			0
' @entity1 's confidence levels are at the opposite end to @entity9 as they lie fifth in the league table following last weekend 's goalless draw at @entity122			1
but @entity0 insists they can do even better after what has been an impressive start to the season			2
' i know what the players can do and we 've been working very hard putting stuff into place , ' @entity0 said			0
' where we are now is at a good level but we can show more			0
' as a whole over all the games we can be better and that 's what we 're all striving for			0
