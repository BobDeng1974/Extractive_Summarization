former deputy cia director @entity0 bobbed and weaved his way through a contentious @entity3 hearing on wednesday , parrying @entity5 ' suggestions that politics colored his decision to downplay the role of terrorism in the @entity10 , @entity12 attack that killed four @entity13 in 2012			1
' none of our actions were the result of political influence			1
none , ' @entity0 said , describing a chain of events that began with an armed assault on @entity13 diplomatic stations and ended with then - @entity24 ambassador @entity23 misleading five national television audiences about the nature of the attack			2
the @entity28 altered a series of talking points requested by senior @entity3 members – meant to educate their newer colleagues – removing references to terrorism and casting the death and destruction as the product of a spontaneous protest			1
on wednesday @entity0 complained openly about allegations that he acted ' for the political benefit of president @entity41 and then - secretary of state [ @entity43 ] @entity42			1
' @entity0 has kept largely silent in the intervening 18 months , but left the @entity28 last year to join a @entity46 consultancy with strong links to mrs. @entity43 , who ran the @entity48 when @entity12 ambassador @entity49 and three other personnel perished in the attack			1
@entity71 , @entity0 's employer , is a ten - person firm whose co-founders include @entity73 , a senior counselor to mrs. @entity43 when she ran the @entity48			1
@entity73 is still her spokesman , serving in that capacity in what @entity76 calls ' a second full - time job			0
' ' and if she runs again – he claims he does n’t know if she will – @entity82 will be onboard , ' the magazine concluded in february			0
meaning that @entity0 , as a senior official at @entity71 , will also likely be part of the @entity42 spin machine			2
a senior staffer to a @entity88 member told @entity89 after the morning hearing concluded that ' a bunch of us are bothered by @entity0 's changing stories , and by his use of @entity46 's revolving doors			1
' ' he would be a lot more believable if his paychecks were n't signed by @entity43 's right - hand man , ' the aide confided @entity0 testified wednesday that after a first draft of his agency 's talking points about the @entity10 fiasco made the rounds inside the @entity48 , @entity42 's agency was ' very upset about ... warning language ' that was included			1
' as a result , ' he recalled , ' the talking points are in limbo			1
' getting them unstuck , history shows , required the softening of language and the removal of all references to terrorist groups			0
' we do know that @entity120 extremists with ties to @entity122 participated in the attack , ' the first draft had read			0
later versions described only an ' on - going ' investigation to learn ' who is responsible for the violence			0
' terror attack or ' demonstration ' ? the @entity28 edited its official version of events to scrub the former and emphasize the latter @entity13 ambassador to @entity12 @entity49 was killed in the attack on @entity13 diplomatic facilities , along with three security personnel the result , @entity0 said , was shared with the @entity140 for ' final coordination			1
' he has testified previously , however , that there was no coordination at all			0
@entity0 defended the talking - point changes on wednesday , saying that his chief of station 's report – which leaned heavily on terrorism as a cause – ' was not compelling ' enough to override the judgment of his own analysts			1
they had already determined , incorrectly , that armed protesters attacked @entity13 consular buildings after a demonstration spiraled out of control			0
those decisions were based , in part , on press reports that appeared between the attack on sept. 11 and the talking points discussions on sept. 15			2
' let me make clear that we know that the analysts had an evidentiary basis to make the judgment that there was a protest ongoing at the time of the attack , ' @entity0 testified			2
' all together , there were roughly a dozen or so reports indicating that this was the case			0
' ' these included press accounts – including public statements by the @entity12 government and by extremists			0
and they included intelligence reports from @entity28 , the @entity181 , and the @entity182			0
' when his station chief reported in to say something completely different , @entity0 saw his account as the outlier in an otherwise consistent picture , which later turned out to be wrong			1
in emails later uncovered by @entity190 , cia director @entity188 called the resulting talking - point language ' useless			0
' that may not be true politically			0
the fixer : long - time senior @entity43 adviser @entity73 hired @entity0 away from the @entity28 in a what some @entity5 think was a move to keep him on a short leash ' what difference does it make ? ' : former first lady and former @entity13 secretary of state @entity43 figures to be the @entity201 's presidential candidate in 2016 , if her stewardship of the @entity10 episode does n't sink her good soldier : @entity0 is now employed by a firm whose co-founders include @entity43 's chief gatekeeper and public spokesman the issue has become a political gold mine for republicans of all stripes , especially given mrs. @entity43 's fiery testimony in a now - infamous 2013 @entity215 hearing			1
asked to explain the discrepancies between the @entity41 @entity140 's @entity218 proclamations and the @entity28 's contemporaneous observations , she entered the annals of regrettable sound bites			2
' was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they ’d go kill some @entity13 ? ' @entity42 asked with her arms outstretched			0
' what difference – at this point , what difference does it make ? ' @entity231 republican rep. @entity230 , who chairs the committee , claimed the @entity140 ultimately used the doctored talking points ' to perpetuate its own misguided political agenda			1
' ' the @entity140 wants to ignore reality and perpetuate the fallacy that @entity122 and other @entity120 extremists are on the verge of defeat , ' he said			2
meanwhile , @entity201 stalwart rep. @entity240 of @entity241 claimed there was a ' partisan smear campaign			0
' targeting the @entity140 and mrs. @entity43 .			2

@entity28 station chief in @entity10 , @entity12 told @entity28 that the @entity122 - linked attack was not the product of a spontaneous protest
@entity0 , then the deputy @entity28 director , said wednesday that he overruled that report and sided with analysts who were n't there when editing talking points
he *insisted* that ' none of our actions were the result of political influence . none , ' but sent the talking points to the @entity140 for ' final coordination '
@entity0 left the @entity28 in 2013 and joined a @entity46 consultancy co-founded by the principal gatekeeper to @entity43
@entity10 is seen as a major *failure* of the @entity42 - led @entity48 , and a potential albatross *hampering* her 2016 presidential *aspirations*
