they may have fallen by the wayside lately , in favour of tablets and phones , but experts predict sales of desktop pcs will rise again this year			0
and a @entity9 startup is hoping to aid this resurgence by developing a computer within a mouse			1
the mouse concept is fitted with a quad - core processor , @entity15 and @entity17 storage - the only extra hardware needed is a monitor			1
it is the same size as a traditional mouse , meaning it would fit comfortably in the hand , and runs on a @entity32 arm processor , like the chip inside the @entity34 , for example called @entity36 , the wireless gadget was designed by @entity9 - based @entity23 and a team of software developers			1
it is the same size as a traditional mouse , meaning it would comfortably in the hand , and runs on a 1.4ghz arm processor , like the chip inside the @entity34 , for example			1
it connects to a monitor or projector via a standard @entity50 cable , and comes with the same amount of storage as a high - end @entity53			1
the @entity54 claims to halve the amount of time it takes to charge a battery			0
it is available for @entity53 and @entity61 devices			0
when it ’s plugged into a device , but switched off , it acts like a standard usb cable and syncs content from one device to another			2
but , when it is switched on , the syncing functions are disabled so the cable concentrates all of its energy into charging the connected device			2
the £ 18 @entity73 is set to ship in march			0
this ca n’t be physically expanded , but can be increased using cloud storage			0
@entity36 comes with built - in @entity15 connectivity , and charges wirelessly on an inductive charging pad that doubles up as a mouse pad			1
this means it should never run out of battery			0
‘ at the beginning , moving computers was a real challenge ’ explained the @entity9 startup			1
‘ computer portability has been improving along with developing a pc			0
‘ however , it still is n’t ideal as it is necessary to transport a lot of its parts - a monitor , a keyboard , a cpu and a mouse			2
' we are introducing @entity36 , a computer different than ever before - an incredible combination of the two most important elements in a computer set			2
’ @entity36 ( pictured ) connects to a monitor or projector via a standard hdmi cable , and comes with the same amount of storage as a high - end @entity53			1
it charges wirelessly on an inductive charging pad that doubles up as a mouse pad			2
this means it should never run out of battery in a video , the @entity36 is shown being used to make presentations , as an alternative to the work pc , or to replace a pc at home			2
the startup is currently looking for funding to create a prototype , and later put the device into mass production , so a release date and price have not been announced			1
global shipments of pcs rose by one per cent in the last quarter of 2014 , and analysts from @entity128 believe they will continue to rise in 2015			0
they predict that this year , shipments will climb to almost 317 million units , up 2.9 per cent from 2014 - almost matching the number of units shipped in 2013			0
they also predict that tablet sales will decline as a result			0

the @entity36 was created by @entity9 - based @entity23
inside the mouse is a quad - core processor , @entity15 and @entity17 of storage
device is the same size as a traditional mouse , and is charged wirelessly
@entity36 concept would connect to a monitor or projector by @entity50 cable
startup is *seeking* funding for the device , and prices and release dates have not been announced
