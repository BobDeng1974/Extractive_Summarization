it might look like a bizarre toy car with stablisers , but the @entity3 could soon be taking over roads across the @entity5			1
the three - wheeled $ 6,800 ( £ 4,075 ) vehicle seats two passengers and goes 0 to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds			1
it is the same length as a @entity9 , but half the weight at 1,250lbs ( 570kg ) , allowing it to do 84 miles to the gallon			1
@entity14 - based @entity13 plans to start making the vehicles for the @entity5 market next autumn @entity14 - based @entity13 is now planning to unleash the car on the @entity5 market next year , claiming it is the ideal vehicle for commuters			1
the company plans to start making the cars next autumn at a former @entity23 plant in @entity24 , @entity25			1
more than 27,000 people have reserved a model , and the firm hopes to make 250,000 cars a year by 2016			1
that 's close to the number @entity32 sells in the @entity5			2
because it has three wheels - two in front and one in the rear - the @entity13 is classified as a motorcycle by the @entity5 government			1
but @entity13 founder @entity13 said the vehicle has all the safety features of a car , such as an anti-lock brakes , front and side air bags and a steel cage that surrounds the occupants			1

however , drivers wo n't be required to wear helmets or have motorcycle licenses			0
the @entity3 's two seats sit front and back instead of side - by - side , so the driver is positioned in the centre with the passenger directly behind			2
that arrangement , plus the low seating position - the @entity3 is just 4.5ft ( 54 inches ) tall - and the lack of power steering , are said to take a little getting used to			1
but test drivers claim it feels just like any other small car			0
that 's partly because its two front wheels stick out by a foot on both sides , aiding balance and preventing the vehicle from tipping			2
the @entity3 has a three - cylinder , 0.9 - litre engine and a top speed of more than 100 mph ( 160 km / h )			0
it gets an estimated 84 mpg on the highway , and 49 mpg in city driving			0
@entity13 keeps the costs down in several ways			0
the car only has one door , on the left side , which shaves a few hundred pounds off the manufacturing costs , claims the firm			0
it mixes the compact size of the @entity130 with the stability and manoeuverability of the @entity134 cycle			0
it will be offered in two configurations - with a manual or automatic transmission - and it has standard air conditioning , power windows and door locks and an @entity143			0
@entity145 's @entity144 also promised to revolutionise @entity5 commutes with the @entity130 , but that has n't panned out , claims @entity148 , a senior analyst with @entity149			0
@entity130 sold just 9,264 cars in the @entity5 last year			1
the @entity130 has a starting price of $ 13,270 ( £ 7,900 ) for a gas - powered car and gets 38 mpg on the motorway - not enough savings or fuel economy to justify sacrificing comfort in the tiny car			0
the @entity3 has a 3 - cylinder , 0.9 - litre engine and a top speed of more than 100 mph ( 160 km / h )			2
it gets an estimated 84 mpg on the highway and 49 mpg in city driving			0
it will be offered in manual or automatic transmission the @entity13 mixes the size of the @entity130 with the stability and maneuverability of the can - am spyder cycle ( left ) but , mr @entity148 said , the equation might work in the @entity170			2
' if it really gets 84 mpg and does n't drive terribly , it would justify the compromises you 're making in size and comfort , ' he said			0
@entity13 will also save money by selling the cars directly through its own retailers and not through franchised dealers , similar to electric car maker @entity181			2
mr @entity13 , a one - time stockbroker and @entity184 cab driver , said he dreamed as a kid that he would one day own a car company called @entity13			1
' as i matured i decided that was as likely as playing in the @entity189 , ' @entity13 told @entity190			0
but he did earn an engineering degree at @entity192 - now @entity192 - and started his own company engineering products like children 's car seats			2
mr @entity13 said so far , reservation holders are older , more affluent buyers who will use the @entity13 as a second or third car for commuting			2
' it 's an ` and ' purchase for a lot of folks , ' he said			0
' so keep your suv or your minivan or your large sedan , and when you 're driving back and forth to work all by yourself , take the @entity3 ' eventually , though , he believes the car will appeal to students as well as used - car drivers who want something newer and more reliable			0
he also hopes to eventually export it to other countries			0
