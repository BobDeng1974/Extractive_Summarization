by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 06:49 est , 11 july 2012 a baby was baptised at birth because doctors gave her such a low chance of survival has made a full recovery			2
mother @entity7 , 27 , developed a rare condition during pregnancy that caused her body to attack her unborn baby			2
doctors said there was a high risk that her daughter would be so severely brain damaged she would n't survive and she was given the option of having a termination			1
but @entity7 , who was nearly full - term , decided to continue with her pregnancy			2
proud parents : @entity7 and partner @entity20 with daughter @entity21 who is hitting all the normal milestones even after her baby was born , @entity7 and partner @entity20 from south @entity24 were advised to get their daughter baptised because she was n't expected to live longer than a few hours			1
however , although their daughter @entity21 was dangerously ill at birth , she stunned medics by making a rapid improvement and is now progressing well			1
ms @entity7 said : ' i had gone through my whole pregnancy looking forward to having my first child			2
i was determined to go through with it			2
' i 'd carried her for nine months in my tummy and refused to give up hope			1
' at 36 weeks pregnant , @entity7 was told her baby might be in the breech position , which could cause complications during birth			2
she was sent for a scan a week later to see if her baby could be turned			0
@entity7 , a full - time mother , said : ' when he started scanning my stomach he went quiet			0
he went to the consultant but she had gone home for the day and he told us we needed to come back on monday			0
' i asked if something was wrong but he said he was n't qualified to tell us			0
it was such a long , horrible weekend			0
we did n't know what was wrong			0
' @entity21 ( pictured left at one day old ) was baptised at birth as doctors feared she would n't survive			1
she is now four months old ( right ) the following monday , the consultant delivered the devastating news the couple 's baby had suffered a brain bleed and she would be severely brain damaged			1
they were told she was not expected to survive and the couple were offered a range of options , including a termination			2
@entity7 said : ' our whole world fell apart in that moment			0
i looked at @entity20 and burst into tears			0
' i 'd just had my baby shower a couple of days before			0
we already knew we were having a girl and had bought everything for her			0
we 'd been so excited			0
' the doctor explained that if she did survive , she would n't be able to walk or talk			0
she would n't be able to feed and would n't know who we were			0
' having a termination never crossed my mind though			2
' the scan showed @entity21 's head was twice the normal size because of the amount of fluid on her brain and a natural birth would be impossible			1
tense : @entity20 and @entity7 had thought of songs for their daughter 's funeral before the birth @entity7 said : ' they had already told us they would n't do anything for her or give her any treatment after she was born			1
they were n't expecting her to live			0
' @entity20 and i tried not to think about it but we picked some songs we wanted playing at her funeral			0
' we were given a bereavement blanket to wrap her in and a moses basket			0
' a caesarean section was scheduled the week before @entity7 's due date and @entity21 was born weighing 5lb 5oz			1
she said : ' it was amazing to hear her cry			0
our little girl was alive			0
her head was normal size and she started feeding straight away			0
' tests revealed @entity21 had a platelet count of just five - dangerously low			1
a newborn baby should have a level between 150 and 450			0
@entity21 was given a blood transfusion to help boost her platelet levels			1
the couple were placed in a private room to spend what little time they had left with their daughter			2
@entity7 said : ' a midwife asked if we wanted to see a chaplain to get her baptised			0
my tummy had already been blessed before the birth			0
' it was such a happy time and for her to come and say that burst our bubble			0
' @entity21 was diagnosed with @entity129 , which is where the mother 's body treats her unborn baby as a harmful invader an @entity134 scan the next day showed fluid had build up in the brain , pushing it against the skull and causing a brain bleed			1
doctors were still baffled by what was behind it and initially put it down to an infection during pregnancy			0
however , at four - days - old @entity21 was diagnosed with the potentially fatal @entity129 ( or @entity129 ) , where the mother 's body treats her unborn baby as a harmful invader			1
the condition causes the mother to make antibodies that attack the baby 's platelets			2
this can cause babies to bleed into their brain , stomach or spinal chord during pregnancy or shortly after birth			1
babies can be at serious risk of brain damage or even death			1
it is so rare , the condition was only discovered after @entity7 's sister typed @entity21 's symptoms into an online search engine and came across a charity called @entity170			1
she passed the information onto doctors and a simple blood test confirmed the diagnosis			0
doctors were happy with @entity21 's platelet count and she was allowed home the same day			1
four months on , @entity21 has confounded medical opinion and her parents believe she will live a normal life			1
@entity21 's consultant was planning to insert a shunt to help drain any fluid from her brain but @entity7 has been told there is currently no need			1
precious : @entity21 's consultant told @entity7 her daughter was using other parts of her brain @entity7 said : ' she 's doing everything you would expect of a healthy baby			1
she 's hitting all her milestones			1
' her consultant said babies are very resilient			0
they can use other parts of their brain			2
she 's my little miracle			2
' @entity21 's father , 23 , said : ' i was scared but i did n't want to express how i felt because i had to be there for @entity7			1
i had to stay strong but inside i did n't know what would happen			0
' @entity21 is doing really well			1
it 's amazing to see her doing all the things the doctors said she would n't be able to do			2
' a spokesman for @entity207 and @entity208 said : ' when @entity7 was 37 weeks pregnant , we carried out scans which showed that her unborn baby had a brain bleed			1
' our doctors discussed the implications of this with @entity7 and her partner who were offered a range of choices including terminating the pregnancy because there was a more than 50 % risk of serious handicap to her unborn child			1
' @entity7 and her partner were not advised to terminate her pregnancy , they were offered choices which included termination			2
' we fully supported @entity7 and her partner in their choice to continue with the pregnancy and we delivered their baby by caesarean section and then provided treatment after @entity21 was born on our @entity234			1
' we are delighted that @entity7 and @entity21 are doing well and we wish them well for the future			1
