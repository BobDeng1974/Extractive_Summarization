@entity0 insists @entity2 ’s @entity1 will revel in his role as @entity4 1 at @entity5 on saturday			1
speaking as the clubs prepare to meet for the fourth time in a fortnight , the @entity5 goalkeeper played down talk of a running feud after the tally of red cards rose to six in three games during wednesday night ’s ill - tempered @entity15 replay			1
@entity17 striker @entity16 was dismissed just moments before @entity1 ’s sending off for an uncompromising challenge on @entity19 , which was later dubbed ‘ dangerous ’ and ‘ career - threatening ’ by @entity21			1
goalkeeper @entity0 has played down talk of a running feud with @entity2 however , the @entity25 international will play in saturday ’s @entity27 clash after appealing his red card – and is certain to face a hostile reception from the @entity5 crowd			1
a former @entity32 club - mate of the full - back , however , @entity0 believes @entity1 will be unfazed , saying : ‘ i know @entity1 , and he will probably enjoy it			1
‘ he ’s that type of boy			2
he wears his heart on his sleeve and he goes out and gives 100 per cent			2
‘ if it is the case he is booed , i do n’t think he will be overawed by that			2
‘ he was in the youth team when i was at @entity32			2
i never played with him			2
but i knew of him coming through			2
‘ it is something he will have to deal with , and i am sure he will			0
‘ but , as far as the players are concerned , there is nothing in that			1
we will just concentrate on ourselves			0
’ @entity1 is sent off by referee @entity50 after he scythed down @entity17 sub @entity19 @entity1 used @entity52 to apologise to @entity19 in the aftermath of the game , but angered @entity17 supporters by appealing a red card many believed to be clear - cut			1
‘ he likes a tackle , ’ added @entity0			0
‘ he has no problem with that			0
‘ perhaps he maybe just lost the head for a split second with the way the games have been going			0
‘ and that ’s a difficult thing to actually put up with if you are losing a couple of games to the same opposition and somebody is trying a bit of skill to beat you in the corner			0
‘ it takes a lot to keep a calm head			0
but both sets of players are going to have to do that to make sure we keep a full complement of players on the pitch			1
‘ there is nothing there in terms of between the players			1
but , during the 90 minutes , both teams want to win desperately			1
’ @entity1 took to social media again yesterday to refer indirectly to the furore , tweeting : ‘ heard it ’s very “ dangerous ” possibly “ career threatening ” for ur eyes to watch the eclipse without glasses ! lucky i have mine with me			1
’ no fan of @entity52 , @entity0 insists he had n’t seen it , but grinned : ‘ he has always been a confident lad , and that has probably helped him			0
‘ @entity32 fans still hold him in very high regard , probably just as much for his @entity52 account as for his football			0
@entity21 celebrates at full - time as his side reached the @entity15 semi-finals with a 4 - 0 victory ‘ but , that ’s just part and parcel of modern football , i suppose			1
’ playing down predictions of more red cards or settled scores as @entity17 seek to keep @entity117 at bay in the title race , @entity0 dismissed talk of a feud between the two sets of players			1
‘ i do n’t think so , ’ he said			0
‘ fortunately , i ’ve not been involved in any of the incidents			0
‘ our players have been fine after the games			1
there ’s not really been anything too much			0
‘ there have been a few isolated incidents on the pitch			0
but i do n’t think there has been anything beyond that , certainly not from my point of view			0
‘ it ’s up to us as players to keep it under control and make sure we are pointing our aggression in the right way and keeping a lid on it			2
‘ it ’s the fourth game and it will probably form a similar pattern , in that we will have to win the battle if we are going to win the game			2
’ @entity2 midfielder @entity150 , accused of using an elbow on @entity16 before the @entity17 striker ’s red card on wednesday , turned up the heat by suggesting the @entity5 side have been ‘ manipulating ’ referees for years			1
responding by pointing to the leniency shown towards @entity158 and @entity159 by the @entity160 , however , @entity0 said : ‘ maybe there were times when decisions went against us at @entity32			0
but i ca n’t think there was ever a time where i thought that was the case			2
‘ i did n’t tend to think that way			0
‘ @entity2 had a few decent decisions in the last few games , as well , so if they want to start bringing up one incident against the other , there ’s so many talking points in the last couple of games , whether it be sending offs or penalties			1
‘ there is a case to be made for a number of decisions going opposite ways for both sides			0
