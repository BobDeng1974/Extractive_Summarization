with their stubborn tempers and massive jaws , rottweilers have n't always had the best reputation			2
but these dogs laid that ghost to rest by saving a shivering trapped pensioner - who they licked placidly until a human came to raise the alarm			1
the 80 - year - old woman had been stuck in a field for 15 hours following a fall , and would have remained there all night had @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and may not found her during a 1am walk			1
gentle giants : @entity14 , five , @entity15 , eight , @entity16 , six , and may , three , rescued an 80 - year - old who was trapped in a bush in @entity21 , @entity22			1
also pictured ( far right ) is the rottweiler owned by @entity24 owner @entity25 said the incident unfolded when his pets , aged eight , six , five and three , scampered off during the late - night walk next to @entity30 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
he followed the rottweiliers as they made a beeline for a bush in the school playing field - where he only walks the dogs when the field is deserted because of their fearsome reputation			1
when he and his nephew @entity39 caught up with the pets , the pair discovered them sitting with an 80 - year - old woman and licking her gently			1
she was conscious and told mr malt she had been trapped in the bush since 10am the previous day after losing her footing			1
he immediately called an ambulance following the incident , which happened in the early hours of january 3 , and she was taken to hospital suffering from exposure			2
@entity39 's mother @entity24 , who also owns a rottweiler from the same family , credits the gentle giants with saving the woman 's life			2
quiet : the woman had been walking in the grounds of @entity30 in @entity21 , @entity22 ' they bounded over the field when they were let off the lead , ' she said			2
' the female dog started licking her and refused to leave her side until my son and his uncle arrived			0
' the woman had been stuck there in the bushes all day , since about 10am , but she did n't make a sound when the dogs found her			2
' she told the boys later that she got off the bus at the wrong stop			0
' if my son and brother in law had n't have walked their dogs at that time , it might have been a very different outcome for the lady			0
i do n't think she would have survived			0
' a spokesman for the @entity83 said paramedics were called at 1.20am on january 3 to treat an 80 - year - old woman who was suffering from exposure to the cold			1
she was taken to @entity88 for treatment			0
used as guard dogs for centuries , rottweilers are known for their stubborn natures and strong jaws , which can refuse to let go of an object unless the dogs are taught the firm command ' drop it '			0
but owners say the breed is unfairly maligned , and have set up a society called the @entity101 to rehabilitate its image			0
while club members admit the dogs can be ' strong , very demanding and somewhat arrogant ' , with a firm and sympathetic hand they can be loyal and gentle to almost anyone they encounter			0
ms @entity24 said : ' rottweilers do n't have a great reputation because they are perceived as aggressive , but they 're really protective , and originally bred as working dogs			0
' so it is good to hear some positive news about them			0
