claims : deputy prime minister @entity3 ( left , pictured yesterday ) allegedly received a written complaint in march 2011 about the behaviour of @entity13 ( right ) , mp for @entity14 , but did not reply yet despite this , no investigation was ever held , according to @entity27			1
the letter was received months after mr @entity13 was arrested – but not charged – over allegations that he had made sexual advances on a constituent who had contacted him for help with a noisy neighbour			1
the alleged victim is now suing the mp over what she said was a ten - month inappropriate relationship , during which he is accused of placing his hand on her breast , exposing himself and kissing her without consent			2
a @entity5 spokesman said last night : ‘ if we ’ve not replied to a letter , that ’s not acceptable and we ’ll look into why that happened			2
there was a police investigation into @entity13 but no action was subsequently taken			1
‘ there is currently a civil claim being made and it ’s not appropriate to comment further			0
’ three years ago mr @entity13 hit the headlines when his 25 - year - old researcher was arrested – accused of being a @entity58 spy			2
previously : it was also revealed that a former councillor , @entity60 , sent a letter to then party leader @entity62 ( pictured in march 1992 ) expressing concern about @entity13 's behaviour in the 1990s the father of two , 68 , has admitted in a court case that he had had ‘ a few ’ extra-marital affairs and that he had ‘ kissed and cuddled ’ a teenager			1

' if we ’ve not replied to a letter , that ’s not acceptable and we ’ll look into why that happened			0
there was a police investigation into @entity13 but no action was subsequently taken ' @entity5 spokesman the party is already reeling from claims that the @entity5 leadership turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual misconduct by former chief executive @entity88			1
however , in a remarkable display of confidence , the @entity5 leader boasted that his party was ‘ on the cusp of a great victory ’ in @entity95 , the seat vacated by disgraced former cabinet minister @entity97			0
on a brief visit to the @entity100 town last night mr @entity3 told activists : ‘ we can and we will win			2
’ his comments came despite signs that the @entity5 / @entity105 marginal has turned into a dramatic three horse race following a late @entity108 surge			0
there are signs that the controversy surrounding the @entity88 scandal may persuade some @entity5 voters to stay at home today			0
on the road : @entity3 ( right ) makes a speech during a visit to the party 's campaign hq with @entity120 ( left ) , the @entity5 's prospective parliamentary candidate , in @entity95 , @entity100 , ahead of the by - election defeat for mr @entity3 could hasten his departure as @entity5 leader			1

senior tory @entity130 warned that @entity129 ’s leadership would survive coming second to the @entity5 but a good @entity108 showing was ‘ much more likely to have an impact on @entity135 ’			0
' we can and we will win ' @entity3 on @entity95 by - election polls earlier in the week gave the @entity5 a five - point lead over the @entity128 , with @entity108 a strong third			2
but @entity108 leader @entity141 said the polls had underestimated the late surge from his party			0
mr @entity141 said his candidate , @entity146 , could even win tonight , saying : ‘ we have a real possibility of causing one of the most seismic by - election results for decades			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity129 ’s problem is that in this constituency hundreds of traditional conservative voters have looked at his views on a range of things and decided he is not a conservative			0
’ a poor result for @entity159 in @entity95 would raise serious questions about its ability to win votes in the south of @entity164 .			0

@entity166 allegedly received complaint about behaviour of mp @entity13
but @entity3 did not reply to letter from constituent about @entity174 mp
