@entity0 was once carried shoulder - high by @entity2 fans at the @entity3 following his part in a great escape against relegation			1
ten seasons on , his red card here brought cheer to those same supporters and ultimately provided @entity12 with a victory that keeps his job safe			0
@entity0 was sent off midway through the first half to hand the hosts a golden opportunity that they duly polished when @entity18 , a @entity19 academy graduate , drove home 18 minutes from the end			1
@entity18 ( left ) scored the only goal of the game as @entity2 beat their local rivals @entity19 1 - 0 on saturday afternoon @entity18 ( right ) watches on as his second half strike beats @entity19 goalkeeper @entity25 ( centre ) and flies into the net @entity18 jumps for joy in celebration after breaking the deadlock for @entity2 in their @entity32 derby @entity18 ( centre ) is congratulated on his strike by @entity2 manager @entity12 ( left ) as they move up to 14th in the @entity37 table @entity2 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity38 6.5 ; wisdom 7 , @entity40 7 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 7 ; @entity43 7 , @entity18 7 , @entity44 5 ( @entity45 70 ’ 6.5 ) ; @entity46 6 , @entity47 4 , @entity48 7 subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 goal : @entity18 72 booked : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity48 , @entity18 manager : @entity12 7 @entity19 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity25 6.5 ; @entity58 6 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 79 ’ 5 ) ; @entity0 2 , @entity63 6 ( @entity64 79 ’ 5 ) , @entity65 6 ; @entity66 5 ( @entity67 46 ’ 6 ) , @entity68 5.5 , @entity69 6.5 subs not used : given , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 booked : @entity65 , @entity58 sent off : @entity0 manager : @entity75 6 attendance : 24 , 684 referee : @entity77 7 click here for all the stats , goals - including @entity18 's second half strike ( above ) - and heat maps from the @entity3 for some time it looked as though @entity2 ’s lack of guile would cost them and the question loomed of whether a goalless draw against ten men would be seen as more damaging than a loss on equal terms in the eyes of chairman @entity92			1
that needs no answer now			0
@entity19 ’s five - match unbeaten run is ended and @entity2 have a first win since november 1			1
‘ relief is one of the emotions , ’ admitted @entity12			0
‘ i think everyone assumes it will be easy versus 10 men			0
but i did n’t think it was a foregone conclusion we ’d score			0
’ before kick - off , @entity12 was aware of the importance of this fixture , both locally and for him professionally			2
so his selection told a story			0
once again top scorer @entity45 was left on the bench			0
instead @entity47 came in for the injured @entity112 and @entity48 was handed his first start for the club			0
@entity19 boss @entity75 ( left ) shares pre-match pleasantries with his @entity2 counterpart @entity12 before the match @entity2 midfielder @entity46 ( left ) tries to go past @entity60 during their @entity32 derby @entity65 ( bottom ) slides into a tackle on @entity2 striker @entity47 ( left ) during saturday 's @entity37 clash @entity18 ( centre ) tries to muscle his way through @entity63 ( left ) and @entity65 as they battle for possession the @entity129 international was a positive presence throughout			1
early on he skipped past @entity58 and crossed for @entity47 , who was unable to get his head to the ball			0
that would prove a familiar sight : the @entity136 striker , @entity2 ’s £ 9million record signing , failing to connect with any clinical effect to the crosses that peppered the @entity19 box			1
the moment that shaped this match came in the 22nd minute			2
@entity0 allowed the ball to run away from him and , as so often happens , dived to rectify his mistake			1
@entity145 was @entity46 had nipped in and the lunge was late and high			1
as @entity46 lay on the floor , referee @entity77 composed his thoughts , before producing the red card			2
@entity19 ’s players staged a protest of sorts – ‘ are you mad ? ’ @entity0 could be seen mouthing – but they seemed to accept the inevitable reduction to ten men			1
‘ in the modern day game if you raise your studs i can see why the ref gave him the card , ’ said @entity75			2
‘ his enthusiasm to win the ball back probably got him sent off			0
’ the rest of the half was a case of @entity2 controlling possession but failing to create clear openings – until five minutes before the interval			1
@entity42 beat @entity58 and pulled the ball back to @entity46			2
@entity25 blocked the shot , which lacked direction			0
@entity75 sent on @entity67 at half - time for his first game in two months following a dislocated shoulder			1
boldly , @entity69 and @entity68 stayed up front			0
@entity19 midfielder @entity0 ( far left ) was shown a straight red card in the first half of their match at @entity2 @entity0 ( bottom ) was sent off in the 22nd minute of the match for a wild tackle on @entity2 's @entity46 @entity0 ( left ) pleads his case after making the foul on @entity46 ( bottom ) at the @entity3 on saturday @entity0 's ( third right ) case is ignored by referee @entity77 ( far right ) who gives him his marching orders @entity63 ( left ) and @entity18 ( centre ) battle for a 50/50 ball as a young @entity19 fan pleads for his side to win as the perfect @entity194 present @entity195 ( left ) and @entity69 go shoulder to shoulder for the ball in their @entity37 encounter the @entity19 captain ( top ) goes sprawling in the air after being tackled by @entity2 defender @entity41 @entity2 continued to press			1
@entity48 had a volley blocked by @entity58 , before sending another chance over			0
then he crossed for @entity47 , who shot well over			0
@entity45 got his introduction in the 70th minute and his impact was instant			2
he sent over a devilish cross that @entity25 failed to clear , @entity46 hit @entity47 with his shot and @entity18 arrived to thunder the ball in			1
with 11 minutes to go @entity62 and @entity64 came on as @entity19 went three at the back			2
@entity68 very nearly found an equaliser with a smart flick from @entity59 ’s pass and should have done better than fire wide when @entity214 set him up on the edge of the area in added time			0
it will be a while before @entity12 is carried shoulder - high at the @entity3 , but this win saved him from having to leave through the back door			2
@entity221 ( left ) takes on @entity42 down the wing as @entity19 search for an equaliser against @entity2 @entity19 striker @entity68 ( right ) vies for the ball against @entity2 goalkeeper @entity226 the @entity228 international ( left ) failed to spark a @entity19 comeback as they drop down to 12th in the @entity37 following defeat @entity231 salutes the @entity2 fans at the end of the final whistle on saturday as they move up to 14th in the table			1

@entity0 was sent off in the first half for @entity19 after a rash *challenge* on @entity46

result means @entity2 move up to 14th in the table on *17* points after *16* games , while @entity19 drop to 12th with 19
