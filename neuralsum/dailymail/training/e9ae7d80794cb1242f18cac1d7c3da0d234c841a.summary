the president 's job approval rating in a @entity3 poll briefly crested at an unenviable 47 per cent december 18 – 21 , after a jovial @entity4 showed up friday to answer largely softball questions from nine women in the @entity8 press corps			1
that measure was a fluke , however : after two days at what was his highest rating of the year , he tumbled back down to 44 per cent			0
even a much - discused december 8 appearance on @entity15 , where the president jostled , joked and showed his personable side , did n't help buoy @entity19 ' view of him			1
@entity3 and @entity22 , the other major poll that measures presidential job approval on a daily basis , both reported a job - approval decline – not a positive ' bounce ' – beginning the day after the late - night broadcast			1
who 's got a problem ? @entity4 's job approval ratings have never recovered since they began tanking in the scandal - filled spring of 2013 walking downhill : president @entity4 ( right ) and his daughter @entity34 ( 2nd right ) hiked alongside others tuesday at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39 no bounce : a december 8 appearance on ' @entity15 ' bought @entity4 a public approval downturn , not the customary uptick politicians see after sitting down with late - night comedy hosts endangered species : this woman displayed her customized shirt as @entity4 's motorcade passed by in @entity49 , @entity39 on tuesday , but fewer and fewer @entity19 see things her way @entity22 saw @entity4 's approval numbers drop from 49 per cent to 47 per cent in the two days following his @entity54 appearance			1
@entity3 's numbers told a similar tale , with that measurement slipping from 44 per cent to 42 per cent over the same period			2
americans polled by @entity22 were less generous about @entity4 's final press conference of the year , however , boosting his approval rating by just a single point			1
that , like his @entity3 bounce , has now settled back to where it was			0
despite a booming stock market and low gas prices , @entity4 's domestic and foreign policy troubles have kept his job approval rating low			1
@entity70 averages the 13 published presidential approval polls , giving greater weight to the polls that record opinions of more @entity19			1
overall , that measure stands at 42.7 per cent approval and 52.5 per cent disapproval			0
the most dismal news in the bunch came from a @entity82 / @entity81 poll last conducted dec. 10 – 14 , when just 37 percent of @entity19 said @entity4 was doing a good job in the @entity84			1
that poll has the most robust sample size of all the @entity19 presidential polls , sampling the opinions of more than 2,000 @entity19			0
the president 's public - perception crisis began in earnest in late may 2013 as a trio of damaging scandals dogged his @entity8			2
while accusations flew that the president 's @entity96 was tapping reporters ' phone lines and his @entity100 was targeting conservative nonprofits for especially intrusive screening , the @entity94 was raked daily over hot coals for its phone call data - collection dragnet , exposed by leaker @entity105			2
that period marked @entity107 for @entity4 's net - positive presidency : by the 1st of june , more @entity19 gave him a failing grade than those who liked his job performance			1
@entity113 ... @entity4 is vacationing in @entity39 as he did last year , getting in 18 holes of golf whenever rain does n't get in the way the gap between the yeas and nays grew for the rest of the year , according to the @entity70 average , cresting at more than 16 per cent as the @entity125 website 's woes became a daily front - page flogging in november			2
the administration has never recovered its once buoyant , glittering mystique			0
shortly after his inauguration , @entity4 's polling average had him on the positive side of the ledger with more than 65 per cent of @entity19 giving him a hopeful nod			1
but now he is flirting with becoming the worst - performing two - term president in modern memory as he enters his final two years in office			0
in the middle of his sixth december in the @entity84 tenure , @entity138 's approval in the @entity3 poll stood at 67 per cent – and that ringing endorsement came just a week before @entity143 voted to impeach him			0
@entity145 's rating was 57 per cent in december 1958 , during a year when he sent @entity19 military forces to occupy parts of @entity148			2
about 48 per cent of @entity19 approved of @entity149 in december 1986 , despite the pall of the @entity151 hanging over the @entity8			0
@entity3 's poll numbers over the years show that president @entity4 could be one scandal away from dipping into @entity155 's job - approval territory an average of @entity4 's poll numbers shows his approval ratings have been ' under water ' since june 2013 only @entity155 has fared worse than @entity4 , according to @entity3 , rating just 37 per cent approval at the same point in his presidency where @entity4 finds himself now			1
@entity19 had a deep sense of @entity165 ' fatigue ' in december 2006 , and @entity166 had just taken control of both houses of @entity169 in a decisive midterm election			0
those circumstances mirror @entity4 's			0
the self - proclaimed @entity172 continues to threaten @entity19 interests in @entity174 and @entity175 , and @entity176 are preparing to take the reins on both ends of the @entity19 @entity179 for the first time since @entity155 faced the same lame - duck status eight years ago			0
other presidents going back to the mid- 1950s – @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 – served less than eight years in the @entity8 .			0

job approval rating in the @entity3 survey went to 47 per cent for two days after @entity4 's *pre-vacation* *q&a* on friday , but *quickly* returned to 44
@entity3 's data show that the president 's much - discussed appearance on @entity15 cost him points with the public
average of 13 presidential approval polls has the president 's overall rating at 42.7 per cent , with the @entity82 / @entity81 poll *pegging* him at a dismal 37
scandals and *unpopular* *executive* orders have *trumped* good *economic* news and led most @entity19 to view him *negatively*
