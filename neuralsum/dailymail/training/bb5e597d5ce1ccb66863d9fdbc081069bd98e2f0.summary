a new phase in the search for @entity2 is set to begin , five months after the @entity4 flight disappeared without a trace			1
the next phase of the search , led by @entity9 authorities , will see underwater vehicles slowly scan 60,000 square km of the sea floor – an area approximately the size of @entity14 – in the southern @entity15 , off the west coast of @entity9			1
' we are cautiously optimistic we will locate the missing aircraft in the search zone , ' deputy prime minister @entity17 said today			1
