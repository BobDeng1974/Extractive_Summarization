she 's a global style icon with immense selling power so it 's hardly surprising that women try and emulate the @entity4 in the sartorial stakes			1
but it seems someone a little closer to home has been taking some inspiration from the pregnant royal			0
for most people , dressing like your mother is usually best avoided but clearly @entity4 and @entity14 are n't bothered because the mother - daughter - duo stepped out in strikingly similar gowns at last night 's @entity17			1
the mother - daughter duo looked glamorous in lace black dresses glowing in a stunning floor length @entity29 lace gown , @entity4 - who is 16 weeks pregnant - dazzled as she and @entity31 arrived at the @entity32			1
@entity14 , 59 , meanwhile , seemingly opted for a shorter version of her daughter 's dress , which she teamed with strappy heels - a style often championed by @entity4			1
both dresses were finished with lace - a strong story on the catwalks this season - and both women completed their outfits with dazzling jewels			2
this is n't the first time that the pair have dressed similarly			0
@entity20 of @entity21 does n’t just share her mother 's sense of style , she apparently shares her clothes , too			2
on trend : the pair looked stylish in black lace dresses			2
@entity4 wore her hair in a low chignon while @entity14 went for a half - up - half - down style at the event family matters : @entity14 , 59 , was joined by her husband @entity60 and teamed her lace dress with strappy heels - a style often championed by @entity4 glamorous : the pregnant @entity4 glowed with health as she left the event armed with a bouquet of flowers last night suits you : @entity22 wears the £ 650 @entity71 design in 2009 ( left ) while her daughter the duchess donned the same frock for a friend ’s wedding in september 2011 @entity4 had clearly raided her mother 's wardrobe when she attended a wedding in september 2011 and found a £ 650 @entity71 design			1
she added a pillbox hat and black 4in @entity82 heels to make the look her own			0
@entity22 had looked equally stunning when she wore the dress her own way in 2009 for the @entity87 ’s @entity86			0
a jaunty blue @entity89 fascinator is another winner with both mother and daughter			0
@entity4 wore it to the wedding of @entity95 , one of @entity31 ’s closest friends , while @entity14 tried it on for size at @entity99 the same year			1
the pair also shared an eye - catching fur hat in 2006 - seen first on @entity14 when she was a surprise guest at prince @entity31 ’s passing out parade from @entity105 in february 2006 , then borrowed by @entity4 for a visit to the @entity108 races the following month			1
when off - duty , the @entity4 and her mother ( as well as @entity110 ) opt for skinny jeans tucked into knee - high leather boots and white shirts			2
feeling blue : @entity20 of @entity21 wore the same blue @entity116 dress worn by her mother on the last day of @entity99 in 2010 as she gave her first public speech at @entity120 children 's hospice in 2012 mum knows best : @entity122 and @entity4 both wore the same jaunty blue @entity89 fascinator hat in 2011 it 's always been the case ! the pair also share the same off - duty style , which they showcased back in 2005 at @entity129 what @entity4 wore : @entity14 and @entity4 often wear similar outfits and opt for the same colour palette country style : their out of hours uniform often consists of wellies , skinny jeans and sloane ranger jackets and tops there 's no wonder @entity4 has been taking style tips from her mother , who recently pipped @entity144 to the top spot when it comes to @entity147 of the ' @entity148 '			1
a survey revealed that 40 per cent of grandmother 's vote @entity14 as their poster girl			0
the survey also revealed that 88 per cent of @entity156 grandmother ’s now consider themselves to be ‘ glam - mas ’ , and are a serious force to be reckoned with in the style stakes			0
with the average age of a @entity156 grandparent now under 50 , researchers have discovered that grandmothers are now choosing to step away from their traditional stereotype and as a result have become somewhat of a style inspiration for many of their younger family members			0
so , the only question that remains is : who stole whose style ?			0

@entity4 , 32 , wore striking @entity29 lace gown
@entity14 , 59 , wore similar , shorter style to same event
pair often share outfits and *accessories*
@entity14 voted *postergirl* for ' @entity184 '
