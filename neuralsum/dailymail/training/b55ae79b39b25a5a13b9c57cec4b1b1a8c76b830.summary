the results , which are being shared on social media with the hashtag # heardwhilstdisabled as part of the @entity19 charity , are confronting and at times stupid			1
' i 've had some doozies over the years , ' @entity29 , who has spent 20 years in a wheelchair , told @entity41			1
' overseas you get a lot about ( a disability ) being karma			0
places like @entity48 or @entity49 countries believe people with disabilities have done something bad in a past life			2
they say it 's a curse , and it 's quite confronting			0
the results , including that of @entity58 , are being shared on social media with the hashtag # heardwhilstdisabled as part of the @entity19 charity @entity63 says he has been asked if he can walk , despite being confined to a wheelchair @entity65 overheard someone being asked if they sleep in their wheelchair ' @entity70 people here in @entity31 also feel really comfortable asking me if i can have kids			1
i 'm 35 , it 's a sensitive topic			0
most women my age would n't appreciate it			0
' @entity29 , who has a degenerative muscle wasting disease , said she also gets regularly asked whether her disease is genetic and if she can die from it			2
' there 's a 50 percent chance i 'm going to say yes and then the people end up feeling like s * * * , ' she said			2
' people also say ' it must be really hard for you to find a partner ' , but how do they know that 's the reason i 'm single ? it 's just amazing how people feel comfortable saying that to your face			2
@entity31 @entity30 swimmer @entity29 is encouraging the campaign and says dealing with insensitive comments is one of the greatest challenges faced by people with a disability comments like ' they say i 'm stupid ' overhead by people like @entity103 are often confronting and hurtful others who are participating in the campaign , including @entity106 , say they 're often treated differently to able - bodied people @entity108 says he is treated differently because he is in a wheelchair and claims to have had a bad experience with authorities ' i was born with my disability , so there was n't really any trauma behind it			1
but some people had really traumatic experiences and people constantly ask them about it			0
' others who have shared their stories in the # heardwhilstdisabled campaign have been asked if they can walk despite being in a wheelchair and if their disability is curable			1

' was overheard by @entity136 and raises questions about what is socially acceptable to ask someone with a disability special education teacher @entity141 was once asked if she was a vegetable keeper in reference to people with a disability @entity146 , pictured here with her brother , says she has constantly been told her parents must have sinned because her brother is in a wheelchair ' what people do n't realise it that i do n't wheel around all day wishing i could walk			1
that does n't even enter my head until someone asks about it or brings it up , ' @entity29 said			2
' for people that use a wheelchair to get around it feels as natural and normal for us as it is to walk			0
' but people still say ' you 're really good at manoeuvring that , you must have been doing that for a long time '			0
' i do understand people are just curious			0
but i know i ca n't just go up to random people on the street and ask about their relationship or family life			0
it 's the same for people with a disability			0
there a limit and many just do n't understand that			0
' @entity183 says she overheard a person asking how someone could put up with a particular disabled woman @entity187 has overheard people asking if disabilities can be passed on to her children @entity191 , who is in a wheelchair , says his dentist assumed he must have @entity194 because he could n't walk @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 put in a combined effort when they shared their overheard post on social media @entity29 said it was important for people to realise those with a disability are the same as others and should n't be treated different when it came to conversations			1
' just because we have a disability does n't mean we do n't have the exact same issues , likes and dislikes as an able - bodied person , ' she said			0
