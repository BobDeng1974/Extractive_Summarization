for the first time , his children learned how their father had fought the @entity45 behind enemy lines , and escaped from two pow camps			1
because he was in the @entity29 – formed in july 1941 – mr @entity1 was sworn to secrecy and never discussed his time on secret missions across occupied @entity51			1
it was shortly before he died from cancer at the age of 64 that he presented his children with the stories of his time with the @entity57 regiment			2
by then his son @entity20 was 24 and had already embarked on own distinguished , military career			1

' he handed me the journal and i could barely believe what it contained			2
i was filled with pride and totally awestruck			2
‘ he was involved in some of the most famous raids during the @entity7 , and yet he ’d never mentioned a word of it			0
' at the end of the war he closed the door on what he had done			0
' he had killed many , many people and had seen his best friends killed			0
‘ but while he had closed the door i know there was not a night that passed where he did not sit and reflect on what had happened			0
’ @entity80 went on to become a decorated serviceman , earning an mbe as commander of @entity108 , based at @entity109 in @entity110			0
he said of his father : ‘ he was never decorated , he never received a medal			0

@entity29 hero : @entity1 ( right ) fought the @entity45 behind enemy lines , and escaped from several pow camps family : @entity122 veteran @entity80 is pictured with his children from left , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 his secret journal recalls daring missions across @entity51 , describing in detail how he parachuted behind enemy lines before blowing up or sabotaging strategic @entity133 targets			1
it also documents his capture and imprisonment in two different pow camps and the harrowing moment a @entity139 agent placed a gun to his head during an interrogation			1
@entity143 took part in legendary raids including @entity146 , a raid on the @entity150 - occupied @entity149 @entity148 of @entity151 in 1942 , and @entity152 , an early @entity29 assault against @entity155 rail targets near @entity156 in 1943			0
but when ‘ @entity157 ’ , as he was known , was demobbed , he settled into life as a greengrocer and later a publican , never breathing a word about his missions			1
@entity80 said yesterday : ‘ leading up to his death he was very strong and had a real spark			1
' i read the journal and we discussed many of the stories			0
' he was landed by parachute , submarine and boat in enemy - held territory time and time again and the fact that he survived is incredible			2
‘ one that really stuck with me was how he cycled 230km throughout the night in enemy - held territory while very close to death			1
' he managed to survive living off the land			0
’ despite his modesty , @entity1 ’s journal makes clear how highly he valued his wartime comrades			1
one extract reads : ‘ there were nights practising landings in the @entity187			0
and through it all a deep sense of comradeship and terrific pride in our superb physical fitness and toughness			0

‘ he had come to my graduation in @entity209 in 1984 and was very proud – but even then i had no idea what he had done with his life			2
in the end i think he wanted to unburden himself			0
’ @entity1 had just a few weeks to discuss his secret life with @entity20 , his other son @entity214 and daughter @entity214 , before he died			1
@entity20 said : ‘ i wanted to publish the book so my children can learn about their grandfather ’s incredible wartime experiences			0
