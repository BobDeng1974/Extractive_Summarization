by @entity0 published : 09:24 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 09:31 est , 4 december 2013 a man who spent 25 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted for the murder of his wife has revealed how he has reconnected with the son who was too embarrassed to visit him behind bars			1
@entity7 , a former grocery store worker , walked free from @entity9 courthouse in @entity10 , @entity11 , in october 2011 after new dna evidence in the case exonerated him			1
now in a new documentary for @entity15 , @entity7 has spoken of his pain at seeing his son , who was just three when he was jailed , drift further away from him - and how they are closer than ever today			1
he said that an intruder must have been responsible , but prosecutors accused of him of killing her after she refused to have sex with him on his birthday			2
he was convicted based on circumstantial evidence and sentenced to life in prison			1
@entity35 , who was just three , was sent to live with his aunt and visited his father twice a year in prison			1
' it was always bitter sweet , ' @entity7 told @entity15 's documentary , @entity40 , which airs on thursday			2
' i would love seeing him , i was fascinated with his every move			0
' but he was becoming more distant			0
he was becoming less mine			0
' before tragedy : @entity7 is pictured with his wife @entity21 and their son @entity35 , who was three when she died confused : his son @entity35 , pictured today , said that he was embarrassed to visit his father in prison as a teen as @entity35 grew up , his father felt more of a stranger to him , he told @entity15			1
' he barely existed in my life , ' @entity35 said			1
' i did n't have memories of him outside of the visits to prison ... i think it was embarrassing for me to think that i had to go to jail to see my dad			0
' @entity35 added to @entity60 in an interview last year : ' when i was a teenager , i just wanted to get on with my life			1
i did n't feel like i needed to go			0
' when i was 17 or 18 i decided to research ... and i came to the idea that he must 've been crazy			0
i thought that if he was innocent , he never would 've been guilty and never would 've gone to jail			0
' eventually , @entity35 said that he did n't want to see his father any more			1
@entity7 said it was ' numb , painful ' - but that he could do nothing but ask his sister - in - law to take good care of his son			1
together : the father and son , pictured on @entity60 's show last year , say they are now close @entity35 even changed his surname to @entity79 - the name of the family who raised him			1
but then the @entity82 , a @entity83 - based group working to help people wrongfully convicted , picked up @entity7 's case			1
using techniques that were n't available during his 1987 trial , authorities detected @entity90 's dna on a bloody bandana discovered near the @entity7 home soon after her death			1
along with her dna was the blood of a convicted felon , @entity96 , who went on to kill another woman , @entity98 , in similar circumstances less that two years later			2
as well as the new evidence , the prosecutor in @entity7 's case , @entity102 , was accused of withholding crucial evidence			2
accused : prosecutors said @entity7 , seen in his mug shot , killed his wife after she refused to have sex with him in addition to the bandana , he failed to share that neighbors had described a man parking a green van behind the house , or that @entity35 had seen the attack and said his father had not been home			1
' there was no scientific evidence , there was no eyewitness , there was no murder weapon , there was no believable motive , ' @entity7 told @entity15 of his part in the killing			1
' innocent people think that if you just tell the truth then you 've got nothing to fear from the police			0
if you just stick to it that the system will work , it 'll all come to light , everything will be fine ... ' i did n't see how any rational , thinking person would say that 's enough for a guilty verdict			2
' the new dna evidence showed that he had indeed been wrongfully convicted , and last month , @entity102 pleaded no contest to criminal contempt for deliberately withholding exculpatory evidence			2
he stepped down from his position as a judge and agreed to serve 10 days in jail , although he served five due to good behavior laws - far , far less time than @entity7 was forced to endure			1
a free man : @entity7 , right , breathes in the fresh air after leaving the @entity9 courthouse in @entity10 , @entity11 with his attorney on october 4 , 2011			1
new dna evidence exonerated him relief : he is pictured embracing his parents , @entity158 and @entity159 , after gaining his freedom in 2011 on october 4 , @entity7 was released from prison			1
photographs taken on the moment show him holding his face to the sun , breathing in the moment			0
@entity96 was later convicted after his dna was found on a bloody bandana near the scene ' i thank @entity171 it was n't a capital case , ' he said as he left			2
' colors seem real bright to me now			0
women are real good looking			0
' then he was reunited with his son - who he had last seen more than a decade before			2
' he looked old , ' @entity35 told @entity60			2
' it was extremely awkward			0
i had no idea what to say			0
' but the pair worked on their relationship and @entity35 went on to have a daughter , whom he named @entity21 after his mother			1
' i 've never seen a more perfect child , ' @entity7 added			0
' i do n't think @entity35 ever got me until he had her			0
' ' life has come full circle , ' @entity35 said			2
' i do love him			0
' @entity7 now works on programs helping other innocent people behind bars and is religious , saying that his faith in @entity171 helped him through his ordeal and helps him to cope with what he lost			0
earlier this year , @entity11 governor @entity197 signed the @entity198 , which states prosecutors must turn evidence over to the defense upon the defendant 's request , without needing a court order			1
' other people often feel far more anger than i do , ' @entity7 told @entity15			0
' @entity207 is very , very good , but it 's something i knew all along ...			0
it 's really nothing new for me			0

@entity7 was found guilty of killing his wife @entity21 at their @entity11 home in 1986 - even though he had been at work
he was sentenced to life and saw his son @entity35 , then 3 , twice a year
as a teenager , @entity35 decided he did not want to visit his father *anymore*
in 2011 , @entity7 was exonerated after evidence which had been held back by prosecutors contained dna linking another man to the murder
@entity7 and his son reunited after 10 years and are now close
