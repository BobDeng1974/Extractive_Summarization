but @entity36 and his father , former professional surfer @entity32 , prefer to take a more humble approach to all the positive attention			1
' how i look at it is they 're comparing him to when those guys were young , they had the same raw talent that @entity26 does now , and if they progress that way then there 's a good chance they 'll be very similar , ' mr @entity7 said			2
' @entity26 is very humble			1

' it 's more about him surfing and getting more experience with what all the conditions are like and learning new things			0
' ' the opportunity he has to just go surfing and experience life this way - it 's only going to make him lead a better life by giving him all these opportunities to travel and see and experience			0
' the primary school student is incredibly humble , according to his father who said ' he 's outside all the time and just a massive adventurer ' the father - of - three is determined to help his son focus less on competitive attitudes and more on the ' opportunities to just go surfing and lead a better life by traveling and seeing and experiencing things ' from his own experiences , mr @entity7 knows all too well what kind of bonuses such experiences can bring			2
