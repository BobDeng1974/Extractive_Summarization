by @entity0 @entity1 is known for its big touring bikes and iconic brand			1
but now the @entity5 - based company is aiming to break new ground in a bold new move when it takes its first electric motorcycle , @entity10 , on a tour of the country beginning at an event in @entity14 next week			1
and president @entity15 said he expects the company to become a leader in developing technology and standards for electric vehicles			1
the company plans to unveil the @entity10 model monday 23 june , at an invitation - only event in @entity14 before travelling down @entity29 to let riders have a test drive the announcement is seen as taking the company in an entirely new direction - they have not previously showed interest in electric bikes , instead preferring to develop the iconic vehicle that has been a mainstay of @entity40 culture for nearly a century			1
@entity1 will show handmade demonstration models of the new e-bike at the invitation - only event on monday , having given a sneak preview today			2
the company will then take the bike down the @entity29 to 30 @entity1 dealerships to give riders the chance to test drive the bike and provide feedback			1
not content on just building an electric motorcycle , earlier this month @entity1 unveiled two bikes aimed at women			1
the @entity54 and @entity55 were the firm ’s first new bikes in 13 years and bosses hope they will become the must - have ' little black number ' in every woman ’s garage			1
designers have got rid of the large , bulbous petrol tanks and shiny chrome which are synonymous with @entity1 ’s masculine style			0
instead the bikes have been given a sleek , black makeover and include smaller handle grips , lower seats and different foot peg positions to appeal to female riders			2
the move to create a motorcycle for the female market has been fuelled by a 30 per cent rise in sales to women over the past decade in the @entity29 alone			1
one in 10 of @entity1 ’s sales in @entity40 is now made to a woman			0
@entity1 will use the information it gathers to refine the bike , which might not hit the market for several more years			2
some see the venture as a risk for @entity1 because there 's currently almost no market for full - size electric motorcycles			1
the millions of two - wheeled electric vehicles sold each year are almost exclusively scooters and low - powered bikes that appeal to @entity93 commuters			1
in addition the company has little experience in such an emerging technology			2
but one analyst said investment by a major manufacturer could help create demand , and @entity15 emphasized in an interview with the @entity103 that @entity1 is interested in the long - term potential , regardless of immediate demand			2
' we think that the trends in both @entity109 [ @entity109 ] technology and customer openness to @entity109 products , both automotive and motorcycles , is only going to increase , and when you think about sustainability and environmental trends , we just see that being an increasing part of the lifestyle and the requirements of riders , ' @entity15 said			0
' so , nobody can predict right now how big that industry will be or how significant it will be			2
' at the same time , @entity15 and others involved in creating the bike predicted it would sell based on performance , not environmental awareness			1
employee @entity128 demonstrates @entity1 's new electric motorcycle at @entity1 's research facility in @entity5			1
the bike has a range of 130 miles ( 210 kilometres ) , after which it must be charged for 30 minutes to an hour to fully recharge the battery e-asy riders : bikers ride their harleys as they attend the @entity138 ( file pic ) with no need to shift gears , the bike can go from 0 to 60 miles ( 96 kilometres ) per hour in about four seconds			1
the engine is silent , but the meshing of gears apparently emits a hum like a jet airplane taking off			0
' some people may get on it thinking , " golf cart , " ' lead engineer @entity148 said			0
' and they get off thinking , " rocket ship			0
" ' one hurdle the company has yet to address is the limited range offered by electric motorcycles			1
the batteries must be recharged after about 130 miles ( 210 kilometres ) , and that can take 30 minutes to an hour			1
@entity161 police captain @entity159 helped his department buy two bikes from @entity164 , the current top - selling brand , and said officers have been ' super happy ' with the quiet , environmentally friendly bikes made nearby in @entity167 , @entity168			2
but he said @entity40 riders who like to hit the highway would likely lose patience with the technology			0
' that 's the deal with the cars ; you ca n't jump in a @entity177 and drive to @entity178 , it wo n't make it , ' @entity159 said			0
he added : ' people want the convenience of " i pull into a gas station , i pour some gas in my tank and i go			0
" ' @entity1 is the largest manufacturer of heavyweight motorcycles in the world			0
@entity186 and @entity1 founded @entity1 in @entity187 , @entity5 in 1903			2
the first documented appearance of a @entity1 was in a @entity187 motorcycle race at @entity190 in 1904 ( pictured right )			2
a year later , @entity191 of @entity192 , the first @entity1 dealer , sold three bikes out of the initial line and by 1907 production had increased to 150 motorcycles			0
during this time , the firm also sold motorcycles to police departments and ramped production to 450 motorcycles by 1908			0
during @entity202 , @entity1 provided 15,000 motorcycles to the @entity29 marking the first time that the motorcycle had been adopted for combat service			1
by 1920 , @entity1 was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with more than 28,000 motorcycles sold in 67 countries that year			0
from 1929 to 1933 , sales of @entity1 fell from 21,000 to 3,700 , but this was reversed when more than 90,000 motorcycles were produced for the @entity40 and @entity214 during @entity215 the brand ’s reputation was damaged in 1952 when @entity186 was charged with restrictive practices after requesting the @entity219 place a 40 per cent tax on imported motorcycles			0
from the 1950 ’s to the 1970 ’s @entity1 were featured in @entity223 films as motorcycles ridden by biker gangs and featured in 1969 bike classic @entity227 ( pictured below ) @entity1 later became synonymous with the @entity229 biker gang , too			0
@entity230 and @entity231 bought @entity1 in 1969 , but @entity1 became more expensive but of poorer quality			0
sales dropped so significantly that the company almost went bankrupt , but in 1981 , @entity230 and @entity231 sold @entity1 to a group of thirteen investors for £ 47 million ( $ 80 million )			0
in 1983 , @entity1 established the @entity237 ( @entity237 ) , a nickname that has been given to @entity1 from the 1920s , when a team of farm boys used an actual pig as their mascot during motorcycle races			0
in 2000 , @entity245 began making a @entity1 edition of its popular f - 150 pickup truck			0
in 2008 , the @entity248 opened in the @entity249			0
according to @entity252 , the value of the @entity1 brand decreased by 43 per cent in 2009 , linked to a significant drop in the company ’s profits over the previous two quarters			0
except for the modern @entity259 model families , current @entity1 motorcycles have stayed true to the classic @entity1 designs			0
this is why the move to an electric model signifies a shift away from its heritage			2
@entity1 's attempts to establish itself in the light motorcycle market have n’t been as successful and have largely been abandoned since the 1978 sale of its @entity271 subsidiary , the company re-entered the middleweight market in 2014 with its @entity55 series of motorcycles			1
this photo shows the control screen on @entity1 's new electric motorcycle			1
with no need to shift gears , the bike can go from 0 to 60 miles ( 96 kilometres ) per hour in about 4 seconds			1
the engine is silent , but the meshing of gears emits a hum like a jet airplane taking off the bike was first spotted earlier this week on the set of the new @entity289 movie and has now been confirmed by @entity1			0
here a stunt double for @entity291 is seen riding the e-bike during filming for @entity289 : age of @entity294 at the @entity295 in @entity296 , @entity297 @entity168 firm @entity164 introduced its first full - size motorcycle in 2010 and expects to sell about 2,400 bikes this year , said @entity300 , the company 's vice president of global marketing			1
that would give it about half of the global market for full - size , high - powered electric motorcycles			2
in comparison , @entity1 alone sold more than 260,000 conventional motorcycles last year			0
but @entity311 , a research director for the consulting firm @entity312 , said having large , well - funded companies get into the electric motorcycle market could give it a significant boost			1
the major automakers helped drive sales for hybrid and electric cars , he noted			0
' their marketing budgets are much larger and they have dealerships set up everywhere , and so it 's much easier for companies like @entity245 , @entity324 and @entity325 to advertise about their electric vehicles , ' he said			1
the bike boasts an all - electric engine ( shown ) that can accelerate from 0 - 60 mph ( 0 - 95 kph ) in four seconds			1
a lightweight aluminium frame surrounds the battery to keep the weight of the bike down and enable it to reach high speeds and have a decent range before needing to be charged @entity15 said true growth will require common standards for rapid charging and other features , as well as places for people to plug in			2
@entity1 expects to play a key role in developing electric vehicle standards , and its dealership network could provide charging stations to serve all drivers , he said			1
' we 've been very silent up to this point about our investment in @entity109 technology , ' @entity15 said			0
but , he added , ' now that we 're public , and we 're in this space , we expect to be involved and a part of leading the development of the standards , and the technology and the infrastructure necessary to further the acceptance and the utility of electric vehicles			1

the @entity5 - based company has unveiled its first electric motorcycle
called project *livewire* the bike will be touring the @entity29 to the end of 2014
it is seen as a bold move , as the company is known for its big touring bikes
but they are now hoping to become a leader in developing electric vehicles
@entity10 can go 0 - 60mph in 4 seconds and has a range of 130 miles
