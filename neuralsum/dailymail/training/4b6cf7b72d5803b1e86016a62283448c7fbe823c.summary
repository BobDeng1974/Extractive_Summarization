the ceo of @entity2 is a woman , it has been revealed - and she is none too pleased with how her male colleagues have portrayed her product to the public			2
last week , entrepreneurs @entity7 and @entity9 sparked an outrage after announcing they were launching a supplement that uses @entity14 printing technology to alter your natural feminine scent - or , more precisely , to make your lady parts smell like peaches			1
as it turns out , they had no right to speak on the subject , since the sole founder of the company is 20 - year - old @entity25 , a former @entity26 science student and self - described ' ultra-feminist ' who says her invention has been grossly misinterpreted			1
speaking out : @entity25 ( pictured ) , the female ceo of @entity2 , is none too pleased with how her male colleagues @entity7 and @entity9 portrayed her product to the public last week while mr @entity7 and mr @entity9 touted @entity32 as a way to ' empower ' women by changing their natural scent , miss @entity25 claims its principle aim is to promote optimal vaginal health			1
' i 'm obviously sort of appalled that it 's been misconstrued like this because it was never the point of my company , ' she told @entity45 ' i do n't want to apologize for [ @entity7 ] , but at the same time i want to apologize to every woman in the world who 's heard about this and wants my head on a stake			2
' miss @entity25 explained that she was n't at the @entity53 conference where mr @entity7 and mr @entity9 made their controversial debut of @entity32 because the men , who both own their own biotech companies , were actually invited to present different products			1
' i was n't ready to publicize my company at all , ' she said			0
' so now i have a lot of questions being asked and a lot of really terrible things being said about my company			0
' mr @entity7 , a biotech entrepreneur who owns just 10per cent of the @entity32 company , raised eyebrows when he said in his presentation last week : ' the idea is personal empowerment			1
all your smells are not human			0
they 're produced by the creatures that live on you			0
' and mr @entity9 , who is reportedly not involved in @entity32 at all , added : ' we think it 's a fundamental human right to not only know your code and the code of the things that live on you but also to rewrite that code and personalize it			1
' misconstrued : ' i was n't ready to publicize my company at all , ' she said			0
' so now i have a lot of questions being asked and a lot of really terrible things being said about my company ' while the men did touch on the fact that the pill helps prevent yeast infections and other health problems , they did not give the impression that this was its main purpose			0
the peach scent , mr @entity9 said , is an indicator that the product is working			2
' what , would you rather have it glow ? ' he added			0
falsely believing that they were the sole founders of @entity32 , many questioned why the pair chose to focus on that particular body part - to which they responded that their invention could ' connect you to yourself in a better way '			2
mr @entity9 explained that the female genitalia is the ideal body part for this type of @entity14 printing			1
' it 's a better idea than trying to hack the gut microbiome because it 's less complicated and more stable , ' he explained			0
untrue : while mr @entity9 ( left ) and mr @entity7 ( right ) touted @entity32 as a way to ' empower ' women by changing their natural scent , miss @entity25 says its aim is to promote optimal vaginal health plus , he added : ' it only has one interference per month			1
' in reality , @entity32 has nothing to do with scent , says miss @entity25			2
she told the @entity124 that her company , which is still in the development stages , will provide women with kits to swab their vaginas at home and mail the swab into a lab. scientists can then sequence the genomes of their vaginal bacteria in order to create a personalized probiotic that can fight utis and yeast infections			0
' it 's nothing about scent , ' she insisted			0
' a vagina should smell like a vagina , and anyone who does n't think that does n't deserve to be near one			0
' mr @entity9 and mr @entity7 's presentation upset @entity147 to such an extent that she has since changed her @entity151 bio to read : ' ceo of @entity2 and definitely not interested in making your vagina smell like a peach '			1
' all i want to do is provide women with agency in their own reproductive health , ' she tweeted on thursday , adding that due to reading the negative press instigated by mr @entity9 and mr @entity7 , ' i 'm on the verge of projectile vomiting everywhere			1
