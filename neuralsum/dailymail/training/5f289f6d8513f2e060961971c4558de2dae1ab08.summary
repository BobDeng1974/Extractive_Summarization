miss @entity2 , minister for education and childcare , said she backed the calls by campaign group @entity21 , which is pressing manufacturers and retailers to promote toys in a gender - neutral way			1
she gave the example of chemistry sets marketed at boys , which she said was the ‘ antithesis ’ of @entity33 efforts to persuade more girls to study science			1
in an interview with @entity37 , she said : ‘ i think toys are toys			2
let toys be toys are running a fantastic campaign about abolishing the segregation in toy departments			1
‘ the idea that a chemistry set should be for boys is the antithesis of what we want to promote			2
' but at the same time we need to make clear that science and maths are n’t just about engineering cars , they ’re also about developing ( social media site ) @entity55 , developing cosmetics , marketing			2
‘ all sorts of jobs require science and maths , whether it ’s fashion or farming , whatever you might aspire to , these subjects are useful			0
so we need a bit of balance i think			0
’ miss @entity2 , who has two daughters , acknowledged that she had brought toys from the controversial pink and purple coloured @entity68 range , which has been condemned by some feminists			1
but , asked about the range , she admitted misgivings , saying : ‘ you ’ve happened on a complete dilemma we face in promoting maths and science			0
