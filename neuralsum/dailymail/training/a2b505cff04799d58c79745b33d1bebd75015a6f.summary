by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 11:28 est , 15 october 2013 wearing high heels can be more of an endurance test than a pleasure , especially during the a hectic party season			2
a recent survey even revealed that more than a third of women said their feet had been so sore on a night out that they danced shoeless and walked home barefoot			0
but one high street store thinks it has the answer to our vertiginous stiletto woes			0
@entity14 has introduced @entity15 – tights with built - in pads which aim to alleviate the pain caused by stacked shoes			1
comfort first : @entity14 has unveiled a new range of tights called @entity15 which have built - in pads to alleviate pain in the balls of your feet these clever new tights aim to make tired feet a thing of the past by eliminating pain on the ball of the foot leaving women free to wear their favourite heels all night long			1
speaking about the new hosiery , @entity35 , said : ‘ the pads built into the bottom of the feet act as a cushion to relieve pain on the ball of the foot			2
‘ for additional comfort we have developed a shaped toe design which keeps the cushion in place			0
’ the tights come in a variety of styles from classic opaque and natural to leopard print and sparkling diamante ( perfect for the more fashion - forward women )			1
the tights , which are available in store this month , are priced between £ 6 and £ 15			1
dance all night long : as well as the pads @entity14 has developed a shaped toe design which aims to keep the cushion in place so women can wear their favourite heels for longer but will they actually help ? @entity61 , an osteopath at @entity62 , said : ' it sounds like the tights are just providing what @entity65 and other foot specialists already do			2
' they will make no difference to the rotation in the pelvis ( that causes back and leg pain )			0
' if you tend to wear heels , however , they will allow you to wear high heels for a longer time with more comfort			0
' so if you have no musculoskeletal problems and wear heels sporadically - they 're a great buy ! '			0
stylish : the range comes in a variety of designs including spotted , £ 9.50 ( left ) animal , £ 12.50 ( centre ) and opaque , £ 9.50 ( right )			1
