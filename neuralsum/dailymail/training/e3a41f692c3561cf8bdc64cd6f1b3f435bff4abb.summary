‘ she said , “ this is horrible ! why is this happening ? i need to help you ”			2
she got me a doctor that afternoon			2
’ onlookers had already noticed the sores at a @entity37 show at @entity38 in february , but assumed they were bruises			2

breakouts : @entity4 , pictured on the cover of the september issue of @entity58 , has revealed that she suffers from psoriasis , an autoimmune skin condition triggered by stress model example : miss @entity4 told how @entity11 offered sound advice on handling her psoriasis and even helped get her a doctor 's appointment supportive : @entity11 saw miss @entity4 having her legs painted by make - up artists before the @entity25 show in march ( pictured ) , and decided she had to help she admits her interpretation was ' a little crazy ' and ' overplayed ' , and in any case , she lost out on the lead role to @entity82 - but it seems she still made an impression			1
psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red , flaky , crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales			1
it can start at any age but develops most often between the ages of 11 and 45			0
there is no cure and the cause of the autoimmune disorder is unknown			0
dr @entity96 says the condition flares up periodically - often triggered by stress - though frequency and severity varies according to the patient			1
' @entity84 can be itchy but less so than eczema , ' she wrote in the @entity102			0
' some people have psoriasis that affects only the scalp or the nails			0
' we do n't know what causes it but a third of sufferers have a close relative with it , implying a genetic cause			0
' treatment is typically a combination of steroid creams , vitamin d - based moisturisers and coal - tar preparations			0
sunshine and light therapy are also used to treat the condition			2
not long afterwards , she recalls , she was approached by @entity125 , the wife of the film 's producer , at a wedding			2

imagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots ? ' @entity158 is also thought to suffer from psoriasis , after she was spotted with the telltale flaky patches of skin on her leg last year			1
it certainly does not help miss @entity4 that the condition is triggered by stress			1
