as @entity2 manager , he did n't always have much luck on the communication front			0
but @entity5 seems determined to show he has nailed the language barrier at his new place of employment - by reeling off the four most common words in @entity10			1
faced with a room of @entity10 journalists during a press conference , the new @entity12 coach temporarily ditched his mother tongue and attempted to count to four in the local language			1
in the toe - curling interview , he even appeared to follow in the notorious footsteps of @entity20 and @entity21 by answering the question with an ever - so - slight @entity10 accent			1
@entity5 attempted to show he had slotted into @entity10 life during his @entity12 press conference by reeling off the four most common words in the @entity10 language the @entity12 boss said , ' they ( b team ) have been training with me uno , dos , tres , cuatro times ' when asked about the b team 's prospects , the 51 - year - old @entity35 told journalists that he had seen them train ' dos , tres , cuatro ' times			1
but he could n't quite keep up the charade , adding in @entity43 : ' but i have not seem them play			0
' the baffling interview comes after @entity5 spent the first game of his new career in @entity48 shouting ' @entity49 ' to his players - despite no - one in the squad bearing that name			1
a video of the press conference quickly spread online and the @entity55 was ridiculed for his bumbling efforts			1
@entity57 wrote on @entity58 : ' @entity5 trying to speak @entity10 , it 's like yer dad trying to order a meal on holiday ... the waiter speaks better @entity43 than him			2
' @entity65 posted : ' here 's @entity5 attempting to speak @entity10			2
could n't have asked for a better laugh			0
' the baffling interview comes after @entity5 spent his first game yelling out ' @entity49 ' to his players - despite no - one in the squad bearing that name while @entity73 wrote : ' @entity5 ' @entity10 lessons are going well , i see			1
' and @entity75 wrote : ' @entity5 speaking @entity10 reminds me of every hotel in @entity77 i 've ever stayed in full of jocks '			2
the video prompted comparison with the excruciating @entity20 interview , which was carried out with @entity83 media when he became a club boss there in 2008			0
in a television interview which became a huge hit on @entity89 , @entity86 appeared to emulate the great @entity83 coaches @entity91 and @entity92 by trying to sound like them			2
there was speculation that @entity86 was deliberately speaking with a @entity83 accent as a private joke but reports at the time suggested it was no prank - and that was how he spoke @entity43 over there			1
@entity101 midfielder @entity21 was also ridiculed for his @entity103 accent at @entity104 after a hilarious press conference in which he acknowledged that he sounded like a cast member of ' @entity107			1
in 2012 , after making his debut for the club , @entity21 conducted his post-match press conference in @entity43 - but using a bizarre @entity103 accent after the interview , @entity21 tweeted : ' @entity113 ( sic ) eat your heart out ... ' he later added : ' in my defence , it is very difficult to do a press conference in @entity120 for a room full of @entity103 journalists			1
' the alternative is to speak like a ' @entity125 ! ' character which is choose			0
its simply a case of you had to be there			0
# youstupidwomen ! ' he even came up with a novel name for the language , and said : ' i am christening this new language @entity135			0
' @entity5 was appointed at @entity12 last month following his disastrous 10 - month spell at @entity138			2
he is one of just a few @entity140 managers who have tried their luck abroad			0
the team drew @entity5 's opening match , before winning 3 - 0 win against @entity145 in the second game			0
but he made an faux pas during his first game when the touchline camera revealed he was frantically shouting ' @entity49 ! ' at one of his players - despite having 11 days to learn his players ' names			0
as @entity5 talked about @entity12 afterwards , it was also noticeable that he slipped between ' they ' and ' we ' .			0
