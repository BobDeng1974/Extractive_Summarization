this is the @entity2 above @entity8 in @entity9 he says there is a very narrow window available to get shots of the @entity2 so he was pleased to capture them			1
mr @entity15 , 50 , from @entity54 , said : ' in the @entity6 the @entity2 can only be seen in summer , between may and august			0
' the optimum time frame to shoot it is between 12.30am and 02.30am , before it gets too light			0
' and even then you can only really see it in the dark moon phase - a week either side of a full moon			0
' what 's more , the skies have to be crystal clear to allow for good shots - which all makes for a very narrow window of opportunity			0
' it 's a very spectacular sight , especially when you see it with the naked eye - and i like the challenge of seeing it in the @entity6			0
