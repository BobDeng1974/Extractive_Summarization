@entity0 could not even bring himself to look at @entity1 , the winner of the @entity2			1
neither put his arm around the other ’s shoulder for the podium pictures			2
they then travelled back to the paddock press conference in separate minibuses			2
they sat on the dais @entity12 without so much as a glance at each other			2
the two @entity17 contenders are not talking in private or public			2
@entity1 winked at his manager , @entity20			1
a smile constantly played across his lips			0
@entity0 , by contrast , glowered from under the long , straight brim of his @entity26 cap			1
he answered enquiries in a downbeat manner			0
celebration : @entity1 high fives his @entity26 crew after victory at the @entity2 trophy : @entity1 has won in @entity34 two years running , ending @entity0 's four - race streak agonising : it was a long day for @entity0 , who was still upset over what happened in qualifying start to finish : @entity1 has won the @entity2 , with @entity26 team - mate @entity0 behind start to finish : @entity1 has won the @entity2 , with @entity26 team - mate @entity0 behind contrasting moods : @entity1 and @entity0 spray the traditional champagne after the race @entity45 : @entity46 had to watch the back - end of the @entity26 all afternoon the source of the tension was @entity1 ’s final lap in qualifying on saturday , when he missed the @entity53 turn and drove into an escape road			1
this brought out yellow caution flags , meaning that @entity0 had to abort his attempt to take pole position			1
the stewards investigated the incident and exonerated @entity1			1
the driver steward was @entity62 , a veteran of 146 grands prix and a man noted for probity and fairness			2
that , however , did not satisfy @entity0			1
he believed @entity1 had deliberately thwarted him			1
if he did , it was the perfect crime			0
so tense are relations that the two men did not share a room for their post-qualifying debrief			0
@entity0 said , slightly implausibly : ‘ i went to the toilet and @entity1 did his debrief before i got there , which is unusual			1
’ on sunday morning the froideur persisted			2
@entity0 rejected @entity1 ’s apology and proffered hand			1
@entity78 , the @entity26 chairman , said : ‘ this thing we have with @entity0 accusing the other of doing something stupid , i tried to fix it this morning with @entity0 but i could n’t			1
if they hit each other at the first corner , then they have a problem with me			0
’ @entity90 leaderboard designer : the crowds watch on at the rich principality as @entity0 passes them on the street circuit try and catch me : @entity1 started well as he held off @entity0 at the front of the grid not easy : @entity98 speaks to his engineer after he was forced to retire from the race in @entity34 blow : @entity102 has to leave his @entity104 car after crashing early on down and out : and the @entity106 's car is airlifted out of the circuit after the safety car stoppage @entity1 was away cleanly so there was no chance of a collision and the race progressed as a predictable procession on @entity115 ’s narrow streets			1
@entity1 led from lights out to chequered flag to take a four - point lead over second - placed @entity0 in the standings			1
@entity46 , of @entity120 , was third to go ahead of his world champion team - mate @entity98 , who retired with a faulty engine			1
@entity0 , again , showed his petulant side in the cockpit			1
during the second of two safety car periods , after @entity127 crashed his @entity128 , both @entity26 came in , @entity1 first with @entity0 arriving at the pit box just as his team - mate was vacating it			1
‘ i ca n’t believe we just had to pit , ’ he said over the radio			0
‘ can you just inform me of what options i have ? we should have pitted on that lap before but i knew you would n’t call me in , guys			0
’ boost : @entity46 finally manages a podium finish , his first in @entity115 blow : @entity141 did n't finish in the points yet again in his @entity143 superstar : actor @entity145 is one of many stars present at the @entity2 later , when he had something in his eye and was told how close @entity46 was getting to him , he said : ‘ i do n’t care about @entity46			1
i want to know what the gap is to @entity1			1
’ afterwards , @entity0 returned to the subject of qualifying and again argued the case against @entity1 by innuendo , saying : ‘ i wish you could have seen the data			1
i ’m sure you did see on tv			0
if you have n’t seen what was on tv then you should go and watch it			0
i saw something late on last night , and all i could do was smile			0
’ pressed on the nature of the data he saw , @entity0 said : ‘ i ’m not going to tell you			1
i just wish you could see it			0
then you could see for yourself			0
’ a straw poll of informed paddock observers returned a verdict split pretty much down the middle on @entity1 ’s intentions			2
there is a background to saturday ’s events			0
sources within @entity26 have revealed @entity0 pressed the overtaking mode button on his steering wheel in the closing stages of the @entity178 @entity2 a fortnight ago despite being told by his engineers not to			2
the extra power enabled him to hold off @entity1			2
@entity0 was admonished , @entity1 mentally noted the incident for future reference			1
@entity184 pride : @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 party ahead of race day on sunday footballers out in force : @entity191 took time out of @entity194 's @entity193 preparations to visit so it may be there was a tit - for - tat element to @entity1 ’s actions as the clock ran down in qualifying : if you play dirty , i ’ll play dirty			1
@entity0 said last week he is hungrier for success because he comes from a @entity205 council estate rather than brought up in @entity115 as @entity1 was ( though @entity0 was lavishly funded by @entity206 : a salary , a private tutor and a @entity26 )			1
but both are tough and resilient			0
as @entity78 said : ‘ you have to be a b * * * * * * if you want to win in @entity90			0
tell me one nice guy out there			0
do we start with @entity214 ? this is a breed of people who are 100 per cent focused			0
they use every trick to blow the other one off			0
and in the same team it ’s harder			2
here it ’s very tense			0
’ @entity0 , who at times wallows in his distress and wears it indulgently , was somewhat more sanguine after the official press conferences when speaking to a smaller group of journalists in the garage			2
‘ what does n’t break you will make you stronger , ’ he said			0
it is rare for an internal team rivalry to erupt so spectacularly as early as the sixth race of the season			2
@entity78 is there to manage it			0
he is close to both drivers and speaks from experience as a three - time world champion			0
‘ you ca n’t stop the rivalry , ’ he said			0
‘ one thing is clear , that @entity0 , from my point of view , has a one or two tenths advantage over @entity1			1
he can get the laps in qualifying			0
runs in the family : @entity245 arrives with her daughter @entity246 and her partner @entity247 legend : @entity250 director @entity249 ( right ) is spotted in the paddock interview : @entity253 is asked questions on @entity255 ahead of the race ‘ and @entity1 is working hard — my type — with the mechanics and engineers with the tyres			1
so we have one natural talent , very emotional			0
and we have another guy who is doing the same job in another way			0
‘ we have two different drivers , but in the end they get the same results			0
so for me it ’s a very good situation			0
’ down the field , @entity270 scored their first points in five years in the sport through @entity275 ’s ninth place , a contrast with fellow back - markers @entity277 , whose owner @entity279 has put them up for sale just as he is celebrating his football team , @entity281 , winning promotion to the @entity283			1
@entity284 was another notable achiever , moving from 12th on the grid to finish sixth for @entity206			2
thoughts turn to the next race in @entity288 a fortnight hence and the next instalment of the @entity291 - @entity1 feud			1
will they have hugged and made up by then ? ‘ it will be a while , ’ said @entity0 .			2

@entity1 leads from pole to finish ahead of @entity0
@entity298 driver *unhappy* at @entity1 's pole and team 's *strategy* on sunday
@entity1 *regains* lead from @entity291 in driver 's standings
@entity120 's @entity46 finishes in third place
@entity98 forced to retire early on 100th appearance for @entity120
@entity275 finishes ninth to score @entity270 's first ever points
