by @entity0 @entity3 billionaire @entity2 's first attempt into the world of politics has left him looking boastful and arrogant			2
the 28 - year - old is planning to launch a new political advocacy group made up of @entity9 figures which will initially concentrate on immigration and education reform			1
but a leaked prospectus for the @entity13 has revealed boasts that figures in the information technology industry will be able to project spectacular political power due to their bank balance and social standing			1
@entity19 - faced : @entity3 billionaire @entity2 's first attempt into the world of politics has left him looking boastful and arrogant the claims come in an e-mail document drawn up by @entity23 who has been tipped to run the new advocacy group , reported political newspaper @entity26			1
@entity23 is the former college roommate of mr @entity2 who , unlike his famous friend , decided to stay enrolled in @entity28 instead of dropping out to make @entity3			2
under a section titled ' our tactical assets , ' the prospectus lists three reasons why ' people in tech ' can be organized into ' one of the most powerful political forces			1
' the claims come in an e-mail document drawn up by @entity23 , mr @entity2 's former @entity28 roommate , who has been tipped to run the new advocacy group ' 1 : we control massive distribution channels , both as companies and individuals			1
we saw the tip of the iceberg with @entity47 / @entity46			2
' 2 : ' our voice carries a lot of weight because we are broadly popular with @entity51			0
we have individuals with a lot of money			0
if deployed properly this can have huge influence in the current campaign finance environment			0
' pledge : the prospectus also states that @entity60 founder @entity59 is a founding member of the group the prospectus also states that @entity60 founder @entity59 is founding member of the group named ' @entity65			1
' source suggests that mr @entity59 has not yet signed up and the group will not go by that name			1
after discovering it had been leaked mr @entity23 issued a statement saying : ' some of the information contained in this email is outdated and not representative of the kind of work this organization will perform			1
moreover , i regret some of the language in the email was poorly - chosen and could give a misimpression of the views and aspirations of this organization and those associated with it			1
' the @entity3 founder has slowly been merging into the political scene with a few scattered donations in the past , but now he will have a formal avenue where he can direct funding towards projects - and candidates - close to his heart			1
though he remained relatively neutral politically in previous years , his allegiances have become more and more public of late			0
in february the @entity98 - based , @entity97 native held a fundraiser in @entity9 for @entity101 governor @entity100			1
fast friends : @entity101 governor @entity100 , left , @entity3 ceo @entity2 , center , and @entity105 mayor @entity104 , right , spoke at an educational summit earlier this year @entity2 and his wife @entity107 become close with the governor since he donated $ 100million in 2011 to help improve public schools in one of the state 's toughest cities			1
a fan with that kind of money could undoubtedly be helpful for mr @entity100 as he evaluates his presidential prospects for 2016			0
' they admire his leadership on education reform and other issues and look forward to continuing their important work together on behalf of @entity105 's school children			0
@entity2 and @entity107 are happy to host him at their home to support his re-election , ' @entity3 spokesman @entity123 told @entity127			0
prior to the @entity100 fundraiser , @entity2 had kept his political leanings close to the vest			2
he predictably posted in january about the proposed laws relating to internet privacy , but it also comes as the @entity3 office in @entity135 has bulked up their public policy presence			0
host and hostess : @entity2 's wife , @entity2 , helped entertain gov. @entity100 at their home for the fundraiser just last week , they released a picture of @entity144 congressman @entity144 signing a wall at the @entity135 office when he came in for a visit with their policy team about an unspecified topic			0
aside from his 2010 donation to @entity105 public schools and the fundraiser for @entity100 last month , @entity2 ’s only publicly - recorded donations have been to the @entity13 run by his company			2
from there , the @entity156 has donated to a spread of both @entity160 and @entity161 politicians			0
radio silence : until now , @entity2 has been fairly reserved in his political spending , only donating $ 5,000 twice to @entity3 's political action committee his spending has n’t been limited to political campaigns , as he and his pediatrician wife donated a total of $ 498.8million to charitable causes in 2012 , putting them in line after billionaire @entity172			1
the @entity173 reported that he donated 18 million shares of @entity3 stock to the @entity176 in 2012			0
the shares are valued at about $ 498.8million and he directed it towards the local group			2
education and health programs are two of the many ways that the non-profit directs their funds			0
' together , we will look for areas in education and health to focus on next			0
i 'm hopeful we 'll be able to have as positive an impact in our next set of projects , ' mr @entity2 posted on his @entity3 page at the time of his december donation .			0
