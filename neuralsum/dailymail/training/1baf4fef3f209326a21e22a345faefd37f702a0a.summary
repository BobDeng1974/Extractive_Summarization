by @entity0 published : 04:53 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 18:12 est , 20 september 2012 never in the @entity4 ’ wildest dreams would one of their party political broadcasts have gone viral to a global audience			1
but then , never in their wildest dreams would it have involved @entity9 singing ‘ i ’m sorry , i ’m sorry , i ’m so , so sorry ’ , over and over again			1
the deputy prime minister ’s attempt to apologise for his tuition fees u-turn backfired spectacularly yesterday , after his sombre televised address ended up in the hands of internet satirists			1
scroll down to watch the video remix deputy prime minister @entity9 filmed his apology video at his home in @entity20 , @entity21 the autotune remix of @entity9 's speech got some people thinking that if it all goes wrong in 2015 he could always try a career in music			1
a rash of @entity30 hashtags including # @entity31 and # @entity32 made hilarious suggestions for band names and lyrics : @ @entity36 : whatever i said , whatever i did , i did n't mean it @ reporterboy : let 's stick to @entity41 @ @entity42 do n't blame it on the sunshine , do n't blame it on the moonlight , do n't blame it on the good times , blame it on the @entity50 @ @entity51 : mings can only get better @ guywalters : ' no direction ' @ @entity55 : i fought the @entity57 and the @entity57 won			2
@ curseofham : i believe in a man called @entity59 @ @entity60 : oh @entity61 @ @entity62 to @entity63 @ @entity64 : @entity65 @ grvlx001 : @entity66 @ 1968bonner : depressed mode @ @entity68 : the @entity69 they turned his apology into a music video , setting his words to an up - tempo beat , and using autotune software to alter his voice so it appeared as though he were singing			2
the spoof , made by satirical website @entity81 , rapidly went viral , with thousands of viewers watching it around the world			0
many took the opportunity to mock the @entity4 leader by leaving comments on @entity88			0
one wrote : ‘ when i make a promise i keep to it , and i promise i will never vote for you ’			0
another posted : ‘ @entity9 could be the founder member of a new boy band – you could call it no direction			2
’ activists on grassroots website @entity97 were equally hostile			0
one branded the video ‘ utterly cringe - making ’ , while another said : ‘ all in all a dreadful mess			0
the web is already full of videos of @entity9 ’s speech set to music			2
‘ the problem is – and i voted @entity4 – they are funny and make @entity9 look silly			2
he looks like a lost little boy			0
’ with the spoof video rapidly threatening to overshadow his apology completely , mr @entity9 tried to salvage something from the situation by agreeing to let the poke release the song as a charity single			1
responding to the website ’s request on @entity30 , mr @entity9 said ‘ permission granted ’ , as long as the proceeds went to @entity119 , of which his wife @entity120 is a patron			1
bookmakers now believe the single could top the charts			0
in the video , made for a party political broadcast to be screened on monday , mr @entity9 says the @entity4 were wrong to sign a pre-election pledge that they would oppose any rise in tuition fees , only to break it a few months later by backing a @entity130 move to treble fees to £ 9,000 a year			1
mr @entity9 ’s belated apology was widely seen as an attempt to reassert his grip on the party , amid mounting unease about his dire personal poll ratings			1
but it also reopened the row over the decision , which many @entity4 saw as a betrayal by the leadership			0
@entity9 used @entity30 to confirm the song could be released as a single business secretary @entity145 appeared to undermine mr @entity9 by saying he had been ‘ personally sceptical ’ about the ‘ unaffordable ’ pledge , even before the election			1
mr @entity145 , widely tipped as the party ’s next leader if mr @entity9 is forced out before the election , denied the pledge had been a pre-election stunt			1
he said the party had been ‘ badly punished ’ for breaking it and had ‘ lost a lot trust ’			0
‘ it has been damaging – that is why @entity9 is speaking in such heartfelt terms , ’ he said			2
he confirmed that treasury chief secretary @entity158 had also warned mr @entity9 to abandon the commitment on tuition fees before the election			1
but mr @entity145 acknowledged that he and other senior @entity4 had to take ‘ collective responsibility ’ for going into the election with an ‘ unaffordable ’ policy			0
right behind you : @entity145 ( right ) said he supported @entity9 's apology , admitting he was ' sceptical ' about the @entity4 ' tuition fees pledge there were angry protests in @entity170 at the move to increase tuition fees to £ 9,000 a year last year mr @entity9 told his conference the party had ‘ nothing to apologise for ’			1
but pensions minister @entity176 yesterday said it had become clear that a public apology was essential			0
‘ over the summer we found that although we have got loads of things we want to talk about on tax and the environment sometimes that is landing on deaf ears , because people say , “ hang on , what about tuition fees ? ” , ’ he said			0
aides to mr @entity9 last night insisted that his decision to issue an apology had been ‘ vindicated ’ , with a senior source saying he had been amused by the spoof video			1
‘ @entity9 saw it and he thought that it was very funny , ’ the source said			2
‘ but he also thinks it is an – admittedly unusual – way of getting the message out to more people			0
‘ that was the idea of doing the apology in the first place			0

@entity9 's party political broadcast admitting he was wrong to promise to block an increase in fees gets a musical *makeover*
deputy *pm* agrees for it to be sold as a single with proceeds going to @entity119
@entity214 says nobody will be *fooled* by the ' *phoney* apology '
