just such a scenario is said to have played out in the car park of a @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , last september			1

two @entity10 men complained to police that they 'd been the victim of a robbery , but an investigation revealed that it was their drug stash that had been taken when the sword play finished the group climbed into a car , where @entity13 and @entity14 allegedly attempted to sell the teens $ 80 of the illegal substance			1
however , one of the teens disabled @entity13 with pepper spray , grabbed the drugs and fled			0
@entity13 and @entity14 immediately dialled 911 to report that they ’d been robbed , but did not mention precisely what had been taken			2

@entity14 faces charges of trafficking marijuana and obstructing justice , @entity51 reported			2
