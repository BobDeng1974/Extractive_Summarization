' i like the image and the idea better than to watch it			0
' the logo for the @entity1 range shows the designer standing in the traditional discus pose -- an arm swung back about to throw the disc - but still wearing his trademark suit and powdered hair			0

right , @entity79 @entity78 paying tribute to @entity1 the designer told journalists at the bash that he was in danger of being ' upstaged ' by the white @entity103 cat after it was revealed he had named a @entity8 bag after his pet			1
