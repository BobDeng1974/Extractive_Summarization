@entity1 companies sold chemicals to @entity3 that could have been used to produce the deadly nerve agent that killed 1,400 people , @entity6 can reveal today			1
between july 2004 and may 2010 the government issued five export licences to two companies , allowing them to sell @entity3 sodium fluoride , which is used to make sarin			1
the government last night admitted for the first time that the chemical was delivered to @entity3 – a clear breach of international protocol on the trade of dangerous substances that has been condemned as ‘ grossly irresponsible ’			1
it has emerged that @entity1 companies sold the @entity3 regime a key ingredient in the manufacture of sarin gas the sales were made at a time when president @entity30 was strongly suspected to be stockpiling the chemical weapons that have caused an international crisis			1
the @entity1 firms delivered sodium fluoride to a @entity3 cosmetics company for what they claim were legitimate purposes			1
but intelligence experts believe president @entity30 ’s regime uses such companies to divert chemicals into its weapons programme			1
@entity44 mp , a member of the @entity45 , said : ‘ these are very disturbing revelations uncovered by @entity6 regarding the provision of sodium fluoride to @entity3			1
at no time should we have allowed president @entity30 ’s regime to get its hands on this substance			0
how the @entity1 chemicals aid @entity30 ‘ previously we thought that while export licences had been granted , no chemicals were actually delivered			2
now we know that in the build - up to the @entity3 civil war , @entity1 companies – with the backing of our government – were supplying this potentially lethal substance			1
‘ while the last export licence was issued in may 2010 , these licences are obtained prior to manufacture and the industry standard is for four to five months to pass before the chemicals are delivered			2
' so we are looking at late 2010 for the @entity1 supplies of sodium fluoride reaching @entity3			1
the government has some very serious questions to answer			0
’ last week it was revealed that the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) had granted export licences in 2012 – but they were not used to send sodium fluoride to @entity3			2
the @entity74 subsequently banned exports outright			0
prime minister @entity76 ( left ) failed to secure support for military action against @entity3			0
an intelligence expert says president @entity30 will have diverted sodium flouride to chemical weapons programmes last night the @entity71 refused to answer questions regarding how much sodium fluoride was bought and sold – or which companies were involved			1
intelligence expert @entity86 , a former member of the government ’s @entity88 emergency committee , said last night : ‘ president @entity30 would undoubtedly have diverted legitimately exported supplies of sodium fluoride in order to make chemical weapons			1
‘ he would have absolutely no qualms about doing this , and his practice was well known to @entity1 diplomats and our intelligence agencies			2
in this light , it is grossly irresponsible of @entity71 to have approved these licences from 2004 to 2010			1
’ scientists at the @entity1 ’s military research laboratory at @entity105 proved that sarin was used in the chemical attack on august 21 after testing items of clothing recovered from the scene			2
a @entity3 army soldier walks on a street in the @entity114 neighborhood of @entity115 , @entity3 the @entity116 says the attack , near @entity115 , killed 1,429 people , including 426 children			0
and yesterday , @entity74 officials meeting in @entity121 announced that they are convinced that the chemical attack was the work of president @entity30 ’s forces rather than any opposition fighters			0
last night a senior scientist condemned the sale , as @entity3 is one of just five countries to have refused to sign protocols against the use of chemical weapons			1
the other nations not to have signed up to the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) accords are @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			0
professor @entity140 , a toxicology expert at @entity141 , said : ‘ the government ’s approval of sodium fluoride sales to @entity3 during a period when it was widely suspected the regime was stockpiling dangerous substances is deeply disturbing			1
' this was a serious mistake on @entity71 ’s part as while sodium fluoride has a multitude of benign uses , such as toothpaste , it remains a key ingredient in the manufacture of sarin			2
quite simply , you need fluoride to make sarin			0
a @entity163 fighter carries the body of a fellow fighter during clashes in @entity167 last month ‘ given @entity3 ’s refusal to sign up to the @entity134 ’s regulations i can not see any justification for these sales			0
have we learned nothing since the 1990s ? back then sodium fluoride was sold by the @entity1 to intermediaries buying the chemical for @entity177 where @entity178 gassed his own people			1
’ former foreign secretary sir @entity180 also condemned the sale			0
he said : ‘ when you have a dual - use chemical and one of the uses is for the construction of chemical weapons , as a general policy that should not be permitted for sale to any regime that is either known to have or might be interested in constructing chemical weapons or to a country that has failed to sign up to the international accords on the trade in restricted substances			1
‘ so in the case of these licences being awarded to sell sodium fluoride to @entity3 it sounds as if some serious errors were made			2
’ the @entity71 approved the sales of sodium fluoride to @entity3 on the basis that it was strictly for use in the cosmetics industry			2
but last night , a department spokesman said naming the firms involved in the trade would breach their client confidentiality			0
@entity210 , which is made by combining the fluorine in sodium fluoride with carbon , hydrogen , oxygen and phosphorous , is considered one of the world ’s most dangerous chemical warfare agents			0
it disrupts the nervous system , over-stimulating muscles and vital organs			0
it is more than 500 times as toxic as cyanide			0
it can be inhaled as a gas or absorbed through the skin			0
in high doses , sarin suffocates its victims by paralysing the muscles around their lungs , and one drop can kill in minutes			0
last night a @entity71 spokesman said : ‘ the five licences were granted to two @entity1 exporters			0
we can not publish their names for reasons of commercial confidentiality			0
the end users were two @entity3 commercial companies			2
' the quantities of sodium fluoride involved were commensurate with the stated end use in the production of cosmetics and there was no reason to link them with @entity3 ’s chemical weapons programme			1

@entity1 companies delivered sodium flouride to @entity3 firm from 2004 - 2010
the chemical is a key component in manufacture of nerve gas
sale has been *blasted* as ' grossly irresponsible ' in light of chemical attacks
