by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 30 september 2013 handbag brand , @entity2 , beloved of @entity3 for over 40 years , has created a tote bag range , affectionately named ' the @entity5 ' @entity7 ’s first woman prime minister may have divided public opinion on many issues but there was no doubting the power of her sense of style			1
@entity15 's signature handbag caused such a storm that following the announcement of her death that luxury bag firm @entity24 - the brand also favoured by the @entity23 - saw a 53 per cent rise in sales of the black structured handbag that @entity3 loved			1
and now , the luxury accessories label and royal warrant holder , beloved of @entity3 for over 40 years , has created a tote bag range in her honour			1
affectionately named ‘ the @entity5 ’ , the bag will be sold exclusively at the @entity30			0
the £ 5 tote will be on sale until wednesday october 2nd at a special pop - up shop dedicated to @entity3 entitled ‘ @entity34 ’			1
the handbag featured on the tote , the @entity35 , was one of @entity3 ’s favourite top - handle handbags			1
made with immaculate craftsmanship , the handbag is still available on the luxury brand 's website from £ 1,100 as part of the classics range			2
' working with @entity24 captures an iconic part of @entity3 's imagery ' said @entity49 , commercial director for the @entity30			1
@entity3 's handbag became associated both with her personal fashion and her political personality , with her fiery temper and the permanent presence of her rigid black bag causing mps to coin the phrase ' handbagging ' @entity3 's love of her black handbags spanned her entire political career , from her election to a member of parliament , to well after she had left @entity66 and retired ' it has allowed us to faithfully recreate an item that as well as being a bit of fun is a really great talking point for conference			1
' we expect a rush on the tote bags as soon as we open at 9am and have already placed a reorder with suppliers '			0
@entity3 ’s love of a good handbag - frequently a @entity24 - became inextricably linked to her political persona – particularly after her ministers in the 1980s coined the phrase ‘ handbagging ’ - a reference to both the structured handbags she always carried and the dressing downs she would give her team			1
whilst @entity3 embraced the gesture of a @entity91 handbag as a gift , she insisted on always purchasing them herself , or through her shopper who struck up a lasting friendship with @entity96			2
the @entity23 has long been a fan of @entity24 bags , awarding the company a @entity98 in 1981 and is often seen at public events clasping one of their creations @entity3 would always send a letter of acknowledgement to @entity96 whenever she purchased a @entity91 handbag			1
she would usually make two purchases yearly throughout the 80s and 90s , all in a very , simple structured style in black or nude tones			0
@entity3 would always emphasise in her personal letters to @entity96 how much she wanted to support @entity7 business and would often purposefully carry @entity24 bags on foreign appointments			2
the @entity30 2013 is held in @entity113 from sunday september 29th ~ wednesday october 2nd			0
bags of laughter : a happy @entity23 pictured with two handbags as she toured the @entity91 leather factory in 1991 ' when @entity2 came to @entity119 from @entity120 over 60 years ago , he brought with him an idea that has remained with the company to this day ; handbags and leather goods should be elegant , be formed out of the best materials and made by highly skilled craftspeople			2
' over the last twenty five years @entity2 has built up an enviable reputation as a very high quality manufacturer with distinctively good styling , and currently hold the @entity98 to @entity130 @entity23 for handbags and small leather goods			0
' @entity24 's trademark is understated , elegant and classic - beautiful leather articles made with pride by craftsmen and women using traditional skills			0
with care , they give years of pleasure and service			0
' the @entity24 factory is in @entity142 , near @entity143 , the traditional home of leather goods manufacturing in @entity119			0
' @entity24 wallets , card cases , purses and handbags are handmade in the softest calf , exotic lizard , and ostrich skin			0
every attention is paid to detail , and gold plated fittings feature the @entity24 rope emblem , the perfect finishing touch			0
