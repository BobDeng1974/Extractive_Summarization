by @entity1 reporter published : 23:12 est , 5 february 2014 @entity3 : 00:49 est , 6 february 2014 there is a pressing issue threatening @entity8 / @entity7 relations that has forced some of each nation 's highest dignitaries - from senators to ambassadors - to get involved in what could potentially be the biggest clash between the two superpowers since the end of the @entity18			1
the pressing issue du - jour : yogurt			0
the @entity7 government reportedly has blocked the shipment of thousands of containers of @entity26 yogurt to @entity8 athletes in @entity28 , @entity7 , who are competing in the @entity29			1
the dispute has gotten so overblown that a sitting @entity8 senator has written a strongly worded letter to the @entity7 ambassador to the @entity8 urging him to allow a ' one - time shipment of @entity36 yogurt and solely for the consumption of @entity8 citizens during the @entity39			1
' no - gurt : the @entity7 government has refused to allow @entity8 - made @entity26 yogurt into the country for @entity8 athletes at the @entity43 diplomacy : senator @entity45 wrote a strongly worded letter to @entity7 officials demanding the yogurt be allowed at the games ' with the @entity39 starting at the end of this week , there is simply no time to waste in getting our @entity29 athletes and employees a nutritious and delicious breakfast â € “ @entity61 , ' senator @entity45 - a @entity50 from @entity51 - said in a statement accompanying his letter to the @entity7 ambassador			1
@entity62 noting is the fact that @entity26 is headquartered in @entity64 - and is represented in the @entity65 by @entity45			2
according to the @entity67 , there currently is a shipment of 5,000 containers of @entity26 yogurt - that was bound for @entity28 to be enjoyed by @entity29 athletes - sitting in a cold storage unit near @entity74 in @entity75 because the @entity7 government refuses to allow the dairy product within its borders because the @entity8 government has not filed the proper paperwork			1
constituents : the @entity26 company just happens to be headquartered in @entity64 - where its elected representative to the @entity65 is @entity45 according to @entity45 , the customs certifications that the @entity7 government is requiring for the legal shipping of the yogurt is ' unattainable			2
' in his plea for a lift of this yogurt blockade , @entity45 argues that @entity26 yogurt has become in integral part of many of the athletes ' training regiments leading up to the games , and it would be unfair to deny them a key part of their diets			0
the @entity7 government , however , does n't seem to care			0
@entity99 , a spokesman for the @entity7 embassy in @entity101 , said @entity8 officials were told about the necessary paperwork , but had failed to comply			2
' we are a lawful country , ' he said			0
' you should follow the rules			0
' training : @entity45 argues that many athletes relied on @entity26 during their training and should be allowed to have it even if they 're in @entity7 in his letter , @entity45 goes on to further advocate for the yogurt company , writing that , ' as the world looks forward to a successful 2014 @entity43 , i urge your country 's immediate approval of the entry of this shipment of @entity26 @entity36 yogurt			1
' he then thanked the @entity7 for their attention to this ' urgent matter			0

the @entity7 claim the @entity8 did n't file the proper paperwork to import @entity26
@entity8 senator @entity45 has written a strongly worded letter the @entity7 ambassador urging him to *reconsider*
the @entity7 still refused , saying @entity8 need to ' follow the rules '
