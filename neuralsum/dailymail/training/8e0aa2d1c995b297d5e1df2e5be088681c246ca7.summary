pottery from @entity1 found in a burnt - out fortress in @entity3 hints at a ' lost ' @entity5 kingdom that may even have been born of an alliance between @entity7 and @entity8			1
remarkably , a @entity10 carved stone at the fort 's entrance shows two entwined symbols which could have been evidence of an alliance between @entity7 and @entity8 , possibly through a ‘ royal ’ marriage			1
a shard of sixth century pottery from @entity1 also found at the site shows it could only have been home to someone of ‘ the very highest status ’ , like a @entity23			1
the @entity8 were a savage tribe who lived north of the @entity25 - very few @entity10 stones have ever been found outside their traditional territory			1
a newly found spearhead dates from around that time , while sixth century pottery from @entity1 shows it could only have been home to someone of ¿ the very highest status ¿ , like a king like @entity35 's ferocious warriors in @entity36 , the @entity8 were known for blue body - paint and a rather hostile attitude to southerners archaeologists are searching the site to solve the 200 - year mystery of the @entity10 carving			1
the stone has baffled historians because @entity3 was inhabited by the tribe known as @entity7			2
the @entity7 were a @entity47 people who occupied much of @entity7 - but were fragmented after the @entity49 settlement in the 5th and 6th centuries @entity50			1
further north were the @entity51 , with ‘ @entity8 ’ further still , north of the @entity25			2
the @entity10 stone is one of only three known out of their traditional territory - the others being in known @entity58 capitals			2
@entity59 of @entity60 , who is leading the dig , said today / yesterday that the royal link could finally provide an explanation			0
he said : ‘ it looks increasingly likely that this fortress was built in the @entity5 , and occupied during the fifth to the seventh centuries @entity50			0
‘ the pictish stone dates from that time , but the big question has always been what it was doing in @entity3			0
‘ we know of only two other similar carvings outside @entity8 - at @entity75 in @entity76 and on @entity77 , both of which were capitals of @entity58 kingdoms			1
the @entity10 stone is one of very few found outside the tribe 's traditional territory north of the @entity25 - and hints at a possible alliance between @entity8 and @entity7 in the @entity5 a spearhead from the burnt - out fort on @entity87 , which archaeologists now think may have been the centre of a lost @entity5 kingdom @entity35 's blue face paint in @entity36 is a nod to the @entity10 tradition of body - paint - but the real @entity8 fought stark naked , and there are records of them doing so up until the 5th century			1
the @entity98 name for the people - @entity8 - means ' painted people '			1
it 's not known what they called themselves			0
the habit of fighting naked , especially in the cold @entity51 climate , did n't harm the tribe 's reputation for ferocity			0
@entity8 held the territory north of the @entity25 in @entity51 - and were one of the reasons even heavily armoured @entity98 legions could not conquer the area			1
it 's long been debated how the @entity8 and their @entity117 neighbours the @entity7 interacted with one another			1
the discoveries in @entity3 hint that the two might have allied , at least briefly - before the fort was burnt to the ground			0
‘ at @entity87 we see a z - rod and double disc which is a classic @entity10 symbol			0
the other symbol on the stone is a fish monster with a sword , which is unique to this site			0
‘ it could be that we are seeing an alliance between the @entity8 and local @entity7 - two crests coming together , almost like a coat of arms			1
’ mr @entity59 said the vital find was the @entity136 pottery , however			1
he said : ‘ this pottery shard , which looks like part of the rim of a bowl , is @entity147 , which came from @entity148 and dates to the sixth century @entity50			2
‘ it is very rare in @entity7 , let alone @entity51 dark age sites - the early @entity139 monasteries at @entity140 and @entity141 being the only other @entity51 sites we can think of			2
‘ it not only indicates that @entity151 's @entity150 was inhabited at the same time as when one would expect the @entity152 to have been made but it means that very high status people in @entity155 @entity51 lived here			2
‘ we might be discovering the evidence to show that @entity151 's @entity150 was a stronghold of the @entity158			0
‘ it could even be further evidence that the @entity161 of @entity162 , thought to have been located somewhere between @entity163 and @entity164 , may actually have been in @entity165 and @entity3			0
’ @entity151 's @entity150 was excavated in 1960 , when vitrified stone - subjected to intense heat and effectively melted - was first identified			0
the fort had clearly been burnt down , possibly at the hands of a @entity169 said : ‘ the fort was captured and destroyed			0
it would have burned in spectacular fashion , and the flames would have been seen miles away for days			0
‘ one known enemy of this area , who existed around the same time , was the @entity175 known as @entity176 , or @entity177 , which would certainly be an appropriate name			0

' lost kingdom ' occupied between 5th and 7th century ad
shard of @entity136 pottery hints at a high - status leader , like a king
pictish stones also found
was @entity189 an alliance between @entity7 and @entity8 ?
