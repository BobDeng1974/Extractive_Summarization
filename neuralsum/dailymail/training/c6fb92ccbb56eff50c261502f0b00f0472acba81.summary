by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 twenty townsfolk from @entity3 in @entity4 , home of @entity6 's playing partner @entity5 , were at @entity7 wearing t - shirts emblazoned ' living the dream with @entity5 '			2
to play in a major on a saturday alongside a 14 - time winner is a fine achievement , although for @entity14 it might be a case of ' living the reality with @entity5 '			1
this is it right now for @entity6 , scraping over the line to make the cut and going out the next day with fellow non-contenders @entity5 and the albeit precocious talent of @entity23			2
@entity24 holds hands up after poor display disappointed : @entity6 admits he has made too many mistakes in his first @entity28 back since surgery before this event began the 38 - year - old @entity30 told the usual assembled throng of media that it would not be acceptable to finish anything other than first			1
another unacceptable week , then , although it is increasingly stretching credibility for him , or anyone else , to believe this kind of thing			2
it suits @entity14 and golf in general to perpetuate the myth but the hard fact is that you have to go back to the @entity45 for the last time he mounted the victor 's podium at any of the big four events			1
imagine @entity50 not having won a @entity51 for six years and still retaining a similar aura			0
under normal circumstances @entity6 would have been one of the early starters , the undercard attracting morning spectators before the likes of @entity58 got under way			0
help : woods and his caddie @entity61 discuss where to play his drive on the 13th tee at @entity7 heading for the green : @entity6 plays from the fairway on the sixth hole during his round of 73 @entity24 holds hands up after poor display instead he was last off on the 10th tee as part of the reshuffle and the non-event of his eventual one - over - par round was summed up by its conclusion			1
rather than soaking in the applause down the horseshoe arena of the 18th he finished out on the par - three ninth , before a minibus took him and his partners down a service road and back to the front of the main clubhouse			1
any momentum he has gained since thursday has been halted by some dreadful hashes , such as the double and triple bogeys on the reverse back nine			1
' i 'm starting to get the flow of the round , the flow of playing again but i 've just made too many mistakes , ' he said			2
' you ca n't run up high scores like that and expect to contend , especially when the conditions are this benign			0
' i 've made two double bogeys and two triples , that adds up to a lot of shots			0
on top of that i missed a bunch of opportunities for birdies and so i 'm three over par. ' off - balance : @entity6 watches a putt during his third round , and , right , follows the flight of his 10th tee shot spot of bother : the @entity30 hits from a bunker on the 15th hole on saturday waiting : @entity6 hopes to iron out the errors in his game that caused him to drop shots this week twenty - five majors have now passed since his @entity45 triumph , although he has missed six of those through injury , two of which have been caused by the operations that make it look less and less likely that he will surpass @entity129 's tally of 18 majors			1
the evidence increasingly suggests he will not pass that milestone			0
in @entity129 's main window of winning all but one of his biggest trophies between 1962 and 1980 , the longest he went between claiming a major was 10 events , but for @entity6 that hiatus is now up to 19			0
if there is any consolation here it is that saturday 's damp conditions were the kind to encourage discomfort for someone returning from back surgery , but there at least does not appear to be any specific handicap coming from that			1
what is inarguable is that he still exercises a fascination and hold over the sport unlike anyone else			0
what could be termed the fire hydrant and cocktail waitress factor might have something to do with it , and the galleries still strained their necks for a sight of the living legend			0
woods - still commanding his own dedicated ' @entity164 ' channel on @entity166 - birdied his first two holes to go to level par and at the turn there was the promise of a concerted climb up the leaderboard			1
yet he has found the second hole a particular problem and , after bogeying it on the first two days , went one worse when a double resulted from finding the bunker			0
he lost his ball in the gorse on the seventh ( his 16th ) and the reload went into the opposite rough , costing him the triple			0
the serenity he talked about experiencing when winning at @entity7 in 2006 seems far away as he resumes at tied 58th , and it will take a strong final round to beat his season 's best so far of finishing an unacceptable 25th .			2

the three - time @entity45 champion finished his third day with a three - over total
saturday was only his fifth *competitive* round since his operation in march
woods started with back - to - back birdies but could not maintain momentum
