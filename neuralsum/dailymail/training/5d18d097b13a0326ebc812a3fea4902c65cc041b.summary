@entity1 captain @entity0 has urged his team to cut out ' silly mistakes ' ahead of friday night 's @entity5 clash against rock - bottom @entity6			1
twelvetrees and company head to the @entity11 after being beaten by @entity12 and @entity13 , while it required an impressive fightback from 17 - 3 adrift before they saw off @entity16 visitors @entity15 a fortnight ago			1
a new - look @entity1 squad is inevitably taking time to knit together , but @entity0 is not unduly troubled and believes that early - season teething troubles can easily be fixed			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 wants a clinical display from his side against @entity6 on friday ' it 's a simple game , ' he said			1
' it 's about getting over the gain - line , working hard for each other and picking the right options			2
' when you do n't pick the right options in defence or attack , make poor decisions at the breakdown and give penalties away , you are suddenly behind on the scoreboard			0
' we have to cut that out , and from ( numbers ) 1 - 15 we 're not good enough at doing that at the moment			2
but you can also look at it as a positive because if we cut these silly mistakes out we will be there or thereabouts and performing well			1
' good teams are very disciplined in all areas of the park , whether that 's in giving away penalties or when to play the ball and when not to play the ball			0
' we have to get up to speed on that and the way we play the game , and we will get the results when that comes			0
' we are putting teams under stress			0
we scored three tries ( against @entity13 ) and we are probably not where we want to be in attack , but we have that belief and it 's just about doing the right things			0
' @entity1 boss @entity59 has made four changes for the trip to @entity62 , with scrum - half @entity63 , lock @entity65 and flanker @entity66 all making their first starts this term , while @entity70 returns at tighthead prop			1
under - performing @entity1 players trudge off the pitch following their 25 - 23 defeat to @entity75 @entity6 also show four switches , including one personnel move , as they look to break their duck after conceding 151 points in losing to @entity13 , @entity80 and @entity15			1
centre @entity81 and wing @entity83 are the respective replacements for injured pair @entity86 ( knee ) and @entity88 ( hamstring ) , while @entity90 starts at number eight and @entity92 features in the blindside flanker 's role with @entity95 absent through injury			0
' the first few games have been really tough for us , and we 've got some obvious errors to rectify , ' @entity98 head coach @entity97 said			0
' as a group , the coaches , management and players all felt our performance in our first home game of the season against @entity13 was unacceptable - we let a lot of people down			2
we will be looking to address that on friday			0

@entity1 face @entity6 in the @entity5 on friday
@entity114 face *winless* @entity6 at the @entity11
new - look @entity1 have been slow to *gel* so far this season
