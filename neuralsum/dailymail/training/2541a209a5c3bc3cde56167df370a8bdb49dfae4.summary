by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 18 september 2013 from 6ft supermodel @entity2 redefining the meaning of the word ' fierce ' in shoulder - pads and stilettos to @entity8 's embrace of the @entity9 , the 80s had no shortage of iconic fashion moments			0
but of all the striking images documenting the decade 's ultra-stylish beau monde , few are as beautiful as those produced by fashion illustrator , @entity17			1
although @entity17 , who first came to prominence in the late 1970s , did n't live to see the end of the decade , his wonderful illustrations have gained a cult following among fashion fans for whom @entity24 is still the only designer worth wearing			1
bold : @entity17 was famous for his modern approach to illustration , shown here in a sketch for @entity29 striking : @entity17 had a knack for capturing movement , especially noticeable in this @entity33 sketch ( above ) his work was n't all @entity24 though			1
other designers whose work was translated into his trademark sharp lines and vivid colours included @entity40 , @entity33 , @entity41 and @entity42 , and he also created a portfolio of portraits with subjects ranging from @entity46 to @entity47			2
' fashion , art and life were indistinguishable to @entity51 , ' writes author @entity52 in his new book about the illustrator , @entity55 , @entity56 : the world of 1980s fashion illustrator @entity17			1
' his aesthetic went far beyond his drawings and he became a great commercial fashion illustrator			0
' his work captured movement in fleeting moments – the way a woman might throw her coat over her shoulders , hold a cigarette or cross her legs – small gestures that can make clothes and the women wearing them all the more memorable			0
' powerful : among @entity51 fashion clients were @entity74 ( left ) and couturier @entity75 ( right ) elegant : a red hat by milliner @entity79 obe groundbreaking : the world 's first transgender model , @entity80 striking : a boldly coloured portrait of @entity83 bold , @entity85 : the world of 1980s fashion illustrator @entity17 in the bold , @entity56 , page after page shows smoky - eyed women , swan - necked and crimson - lipped , an oddly haunting record of a decade that style was rumoured to have forgotten			1
most spectacular of all , though , are the illustrations that deal with @entity97 couture - then enjoying a particularly opulent moment - and a passion of @entity51			0
he embraced it gluttonously , says @entity52 , who adds : ' the flamboyance of the moment was a perfect fit for his vocation : fashion swung his way as the hard outlines , bold colours and overt glamour all lent themselves to his pen and paintbrush			0
' tragically , @entity17 was n't given much time to pursue his love of couture , dying in 1988 at the age of just 31			1
despite @entity17 ' untimely death , his wonderful illustrations remain and offer a glimpse of the glamorous side of a decade much maligned today			1
bold , @entity85 : @entity122 of 1980s fashion illustrator @entity17 by @entity124 ( £ 30 , @entity125 , www.laurenceking.com ) in this exclusive extract from @entity55 , @entity85 : @entity122 of 1980s fashion illustrator @entity17 , author @entity124 reveals how a meeting with couturier @entity42 left @entity51 inspired ... by 1984 the fashion world had well and truly caught on , @entity51 attained a fashion nirvana when , after an introduction by fashion editor @entity132 , he was summoned to @entity133 by the couturier @entity134 to create a portfolio of drawings that were to mark his silver jubilee celebrations in the pages of @entity139			1
@entity132 recalls that ' while people have always perceived @entity42 to be very classical , @entity140 [ the couturier ’s business partner ] was always looking for young and avant - garde people to work with ' to keep the brand current and relevant			0
' @entity146 at the time was perceived to be rather staid , ' remembers @entity17 ’s agent @entity148			1
but he was able to give @entity134 ’s ruffles a new twist : ' @entity51 made @entity42 very modern , ' says @entity140 , ' and that was very important			0
i thought that fashion illustrated by an artist would be very eye - catching and new			0
it evokes a dream , we sell dreams and romance [ and ] @entity17 knew how to do it with a few strokes			2
' the intricacies of @entity42 ’s gowns inspired @entity17 to create some of his most defiantly high - fashion images			2
' the clothes were so complex to draw , it was almost like an exercise , ' remembers model @entity169			0
' @entity171 ’s sketches were intuitive , right out of the hand			0
' ' he was quite free , ' concurs @entity140 , ' he worked very quickly and if something did not work for me , he would redo it immediately			2

@entity17 worked with @entity29 , @entity74 and @entity24 among others
tragically the illustrator died in 1988 at the age of just 31
