by @entity0 last updated at 3:39 am on 26th october 2011 the conspiracy theories are as old as the plays themselves			0
was @entity4 responsible for the greatest love - and revenge - stories ever told ? or was he merely the ‘ barely literate frontman ’ dreamt up to conceal the author ’s true identity ? whatever the truth , members of the @entity10 have taken the newest threat to the @entity4 ’s reputation very seriously			2
scroll down to watch a trailer of the film @entity16 @entity4 's name is being temporarily removed from pub and street signs to support a campaign against @entity21 film @entity16 , which claims the @entity4 did not write the material attributed to him yesterday , they removed and covered up his name from street and pub signs in a campaign against a new film seeking to portray the @entity4 as a cover for the @entity30			1
activists from the charity covered nine road signs , 16 pub signs and a large memorial in the playwright ’s hometown of @entity38 , @entity39 , in a bid to show what the country would be like without its greatest literary export			1
the ‘ guerrilla protest ’ coincided with the premiere of the new @entity21 blockbuster ‘ @entity16 ’ , which campaigners said was an attempt to ‘ rewrite @entity49 culture ’			1
a portrait of @entity4 - but did the @entity30 really write his plays for him ? the film , by @entity55 director @entity54 , claims @entity56 , the 17th @entity30 - not @entity4 - wrote the plays			1
featuring a glittering cast including @entity60 as the @entity4 , @entity61 as the @entity30 and @entity62 as queen elizabeth i , the film carries the tagline ‘ was @entity4 a fraud ? ’ but the @entity10 said it wanted to highlight the damaging impact of the ‘ conspiracy theory ’ in claiming @entity4 was the ‘ barely literate frontman for the @entity30 ’			2
protesters at the @entity69 in @entity70 yesterday used a cherry picker to drape a massive 98ft by 98ft ( 30m ) white sheet over a statue of the playwright			2
they also covered street and pub signs displaying the writer ’s name with black tape			0
@entity82 , who organised the protests , said : ‘ we really want to highlight the issue that @entity4 was the true author of his work			2
‘ hundreds of people are getting behind us and we have @entity4 pubs up and down the country from @entity91 to @entity92 getting involved			2
@entity93 of the @entity94 , @entity95 on @entity96 , temporarily removes the @entity4 's name from pub and street signs @entity60 plays @entity4 in @entity16 ( left ) while @entity61 portrays the @entity30 ( right ) ‘ it ’s great to create a talking point around the @entity4 but ultimately we want to dispel these myths			1
’ dr @entity103 , head of knowledge and research at the @entity10 , said : ‘ this film flies in the face of a mass of historical fact			0
‘ there is a risk that people who have never questioned the authorship of @entity4 ’s works could be hoodwinked			1
‘ @entity4 is at the core of @entity49 ’s cultural and historical dna , and he is certainly our most famous export			0
@entity119 believes that @entity4 , a countryman , was the true author and has rubbished the film 's claims ‘ today ’s activity barely scratches the surface , but we hope it will remind people of the enormous legacy we owe to @entity4 of @entity38			1
’ however , @entity54 , who also directed disaster movie ‘ 2012 ’ , said : ‘ to me there are many reasons to doubt the traditional attribution of the works of @entity4 to the man from @entity38			1
‘ the points that strike me most are his signatures - all poorly executed and hardly a sign of true penmanship			0
‘ his detailed will that famously mentioned his second ‘ best bed ’ but failed to mention that the man from @entity38 had a literary career ‘ and why did nobody notice the great poet ’s death in 1616 , which was followed by complete silence ? also his two daughters were illiterate			0
’ scholars and celebrities , including the @entity149 and @entity119 , have also got behind the @entity10 ’s campaign to prove @entity4 ’s authenticity			1
the @entity149 claimed @entity4 must have been of significant standing to know so much about his royal characters			0
he said : ‘ @entity4 ’s company performed before @entity155 three or four times a year and at least three times as often for @entity158			0
‘ it seems certain that @entity4 and his king must have known each other well			0
’ @entity119 said : ‘ there seems to be absolutely no doubt to anybody who reads @entity4 and is familiar with the text that these are the works of a countryman			1
‘ this is a man who knows about kites and fields and is certainly not the work of an aristocrat			0
it just does n’t ring true in any sense ’			0
