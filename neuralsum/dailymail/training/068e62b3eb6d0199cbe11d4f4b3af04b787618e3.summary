@entity0 should try and follow @entity2 's example in producing youth teams who can develop together and form the core of the senior national side , according to @entity9 's @entity8 vice-president @entity7			1
many of the @entity2 team who have reached sunday 's @entity13 final via their 7 - 1 humbling of hosts @entity15 were also in the under - 21 team who trounced @entity0 4 - 0 in the final of the 2009 @entity20 under - 21 championships			1
@entity7 , who is also head of @entity22 's youth committee , told @entity23 : ' the @entity15 v @entity2 semi-final was astounding , the performance of the @entity28 team was something else			1
fast foward : @entity30 ( right ) was part of the @entity28 team who won the under 21 championship in 2009 man in form : @entity36 celebrates scoring against @entity15 - his fifth goal at the @entity13 running riot : @entity2 scored four goals in six first - half minutes during tuesday 's semi-final against @entity15 ' but i have been chairman of @entity22 's youth committee for many years and i have seen how the @entity28 have built up their policy			1
' from that team many played at under - 19 level , then at under - 21 level and in fact won the 2009 @entity20 under - 21 championships			1
like the @entity49 , the @entity28 decided they were starting on that policy and saw it through			0
' i think @entity0 need to start doing something like that because the @entity28 are now reaping the benefits			2
' @entity7 , who is from @entity55 , believes this tournament is unmatched in terms of quality			2
he added : ' it has been probably the best @entity13 ever			0
' we have seen some tremendous matches			0
there were a lot of worries before the tournament , security was a big concern , stadiums were a big concern , but in fairness it has gone a lot better than people expected			0
well beaten : @entity0 's players look dejected after losing to @entity2 in the @entity76 21 @entity75 final in 2009 high flyer : @entity30 jumps a tackle from @entity79 during @entity2 's 4 - 0 win over @entity0 young guns : @entity2 celebrate winning the @entity76 21 @entity20 championships powerful friends : @entity7 ( left ) chats to @entity84 during @entity86 's game with @entity87 ' @entity15 deserves an awful lot of credit because there was a lot of speculation there would be big problems			1
' @entity7 is also head of @entity8 's referees committee and insisted there has been no policy - as has been suggested by some - of telling officials to show restraint in the number of bookings			2
he said : ' i think the refereeing has been superb , and it has not happened by chance			0
i have seen all the courses and seminars , listened to the instructors , and spoken to the referees and they have told me they have never had such good preparation for a @entity13			0
' the referees have been told to only send a player off if they were 100 % certain it was a red card , but nothing has ever been said about being lenient			0

several of the @entity2 's current squad were part of the team that beat @entity0 in the under - 21 @entity75 final in 2009
@entity7 says @entity2 are reaping *rewards* of long - term planning
@entity8 vice-president says this has been best ever @entity13
