defence chiefs are trying to recruit more @entity2 into the army after the rise of @entity5 and massacre in @entity7 , it has been revealed			1
troops have posted pamphlets on @entity11 military values through the doors of @entity14 religious schools and have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers			1
the drive comes after it emerged there are just 480 @entity2 serving in the @entity11 army - 0.5 per cent of the 88,500 overall troops			1
drive : troops have posted pamphlets on @entity11 military values through the doors of @entity14 religious schools and have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers			1
by contrast , more than twice as many @entity11 @entity2 were believed to have travelled to @entity29 to fight for extremists including the @entity5			1
and the percentage of @entity2 in the @entity11 population overall is much higher at five per cent			1
chief of the general staff , general sir @entity33 , said : ‘ my highest priority is ensuring we continue to have the best possible talent throughout our @entity37			0
‘ this requires us to draw talent from all of the society we represent			0
’ he said the army ’s recruitment from the @entity11 ’s black , @entity45 and ethnic minority populations was ‘ nowhere near where it needs to be ’			1
he added : ‘ we have to do more			0
the @entity37 has always played an important role in making the connection to all elements of society and there are plenty of examples of initiatives that have built enduring relationships with minority communities			0
’ he said there was ‘ common ground ’ between the values of the army and those in minority communities and the military could build on that ground to broaden their recruitment base			2
as well as young @entity2 , the @entity11 army is also trying to recruit people from all ethnic minorities			1
this year the army will participate in ten events across the @entity11 each month , focused on engaging with these communities			2
currently 9,100 – just over 10 per cent - of the strong regular army is drawn from these communities			2
@entity5 : there are just 480 @entity2 serving in the @entity11 army			1
by contrast , more than twice as many @entity11 @entity2 were believed to have travelled to @entity29 to fight for extremists last summer but the @entity11 ’s ethnic population is growing and is expected to reach 30 per cent of the total in the coming decades			1
a defence source said ‘ talent must therefore be attracted from this population ’ as the figures show ‘ that @entity11 ethnic minorities are under - represented in the army ’			1
they added : ‘ diversity in all its forms drives change and can be a key factor in organisational agility			0
‘ this agility is key for an @entity37 facing evolving and hybrid threats			0
’ the @entity94 is working to develop better mutual understanding between the army and minority communities , it was said			0
one initiative to recruit more @entity2 included a warrant officer and recruiter in the @entity101 who had been trying hard to recruit in @entity45 and @entity104 communities – but without great success			2
this was until he started posting a copy of @entity37 values through the doors of madrassas - the @entity113 term for schools – in @entity115			1
this resulted in the director of the school asking the officer if he would come round for a cup of tea and then realising they had many shared values			0
another initiative the army has been engaged in involved army officers integrating mixed - race members of the community by building off - road ‘ warrior buggies ’ with them			0
the scheme sees students attending weekly sessions at the local @entity134 base at @entity135 , @entity136 , where they learn basic engineering and mechanical skills , as well as the building of team skills			0
@entity7 attacks : defence chiefs are trying to recruit more @entity2 into the army after the rise of @entity5 and massacre in @entity7 , it has been revealed there will also be a focused campaign to target different ethnic communities across the @entity11 during the coming year , which will feature across social and digital channels supported by events			1
the @entity37 has also launched the @entity152 , designed to bring the civil and military @entity104 communities together			0
another initiative includes the army working in partnership with the @entity158 and the people of @entity160 to create a @entity161 that commemorates @entity2 serving in the @entity152			2
next week @entity11 soldiers of different faiths , including @entity104 soldiers , will plant trees as part of the project			2
a source added : ‘ with improved understanding the @entity37 is seeking to build bonds with the whole nation it serves			0
‘ myths need to be dispelled and more ethnic minorities should be encouraged to look at careers in our @entity175 , @entity134 and at volunteering opportunities with the @entity178			0
’ @entity2 in the @entity11 armed forces are able to pray five times a day and fast , as long as there is not an overwhelming operational requirement against either			1
they are provided with halal rations , can seek support from @entity104 chaplains , and use prayer rooms on base – one of which was recently made available on a naval warship			0
figures show that half of ethnic minorities currently in the @entity11 are @entity45 and 50 per cent of the @entity45 population are non-muslim			2
the army is trying to recruit from all sectors of society			0
