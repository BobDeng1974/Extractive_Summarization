a @entity3 , @entity2 man ’s pregnant wife is on life support and he wants her taken off even though the move would also leave their baby dead			1
@entity8 says his wife @entity9 , 33 , who has n’t regained consciousness since suffering an embolism in november , would not have wanted to live life hooked up to a machine			1
the life of the unborn baby , which may have already suffered irreparable damage , now hangs in the balance and @entity8 says doctors should fulfill her wishes -- which would end the lives of both his wife and their unborn child			1
happier times : @entity8 ( right , holding their 1 - year - old son @entity24 ) says his wife @entity9 ( left ) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine			1
but because she is pregnant , @entity2 law requires she receive all life saving measures ' i do n't agree with this law ' : @entity8 says he ca n't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the @entity2 law , which applies to all pregnant women , even those with do not resuscitate orders but in @entity2 , doctors must take all life saving measures to preserve the life of an unborn baby , which in this case remains too immature to survive outside the womb			1
that means doctors ' hands — along with @entity8 ’s — are tied			0
‘ i do n't agree with this law , ’ @entity8 told @entity45 as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1 - year - old son @entity24			1
@entity8 and @entity9 were both paramedics			2
@entity8 says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation			0
and this is n’t it			0
‘ we knew what her wishes were , ’ @entity8 , who found his wife unconscious on their kitchen floor and fought in vain to resuscitate her , told @entity60			1
however , @entity9 ’s wishes do n’t matter			0
per @entity2 state law : ‘ a person may not withdraw or withhold life - sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient			2
’ the couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive by a machine and had n’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order			0
but that would n’t have made a difference			0
@entity2 gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother ’s wishes even when a @entity82 has been signed , where the state ’s form reads , ‘ i understand under @entity2 law this directive has no effect if i have been diagnosed as pregnant			1
’ tragedy : @entity8 found @entity89 on the kitchen floor in late november			1
she 'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain			0
she was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness ' we knew what her wishes were ' : both @entity8 and @entity9 were both paramedics			1
he found her collapsed on november 26 and initiated @entity99 , but it was no use			2
@entity8 says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they would n't want to be kept alive by machines unfortunately your browser does not support @entity108			2
questions : in @entity2 , state law stipulates that , in cases of pregnant women , @entity111 do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus			2
meanwhile , it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when @entity9 's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period that means @entity9 and @entity8 ’s baby will likely be taken to full term , or for as long as it appears safe for the fetus to remain in the womb			1
now at 18 weeks , the fetus still can not be safely delivered			0
only at 24 to 28 weeks would doctors deem it safe to deliver via cesarean			0
for now , doctors say the baby has a normal heartbeat , though it remains unknown how it was affected when @entity9 ’s brain was deprived of oxygen			0
‘ they do n't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen , ’ @entity8 told @entity45			2
‘ but i 'm aware what challenges i might face ahead			0
’ @entity8 says that , though he does n’t agree with the law , he ’s not interested in fighting a protracted legal battle			0
' it 's hard to reach the point where you wish your wife 's body would stop , ' he said			0
' they do n't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen , ' @entity8 said normal heartbeat : for now , the baby in @entity9 's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term ' i 'm aware what challenges i might face ahead ' : though he does n't agree with the laws , @entity8 says he 's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle			1

@entity8 of @entity157 , @entity2 found his wife @entity9 unconscious on the kitchen floor on november 26
@entity9 was 14 weeks pregnant at the time , too early in the pregnancy for the baby to survive outside the mother
she remains on life support because @entity2 law *forbids* any action that would harm an unborn child in such cases
' i do n't agree with this law ' : @entity8 says he and his wife , who are both paramedics , long *ago* agreed they would n't want to remain on life support
