@entity20 : inspired by the @entity23 sky , this drink contains green tea frappuccino , a pump of mocha , java chips , espresso , @entity30 drizzle and espresso whip @entity32 baked : the @entity33 and the @entity34 feature muffins and cookies one , named @entity37 , combines a green tea @entity2 with a pump of mocha , java chips , espresso , @entity30 drizzle and espresso whip to create a murky visual effect			1
