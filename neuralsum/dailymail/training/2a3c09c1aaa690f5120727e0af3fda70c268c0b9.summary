the world 's population looks set to smash through the seven billion barrier in the next few days , according to the @entity3			1
it comes just 12 years since the total reached six billion - with official estimates saying the figure will top eight billion in 2025 and 10 billion before the end of the century			1
and it is most likely the baby will be born in the @entity11 - where the population growth rate is higher than anywhere else in the world			1
with more people to feed , house and provide medical care for , they say the world 's resources look set to come under more strain than ever before			1
as populations stabilise in the industrial world , almost all growth in the near future is expected to take place in developing countries			1
of the 2.3 billion people the @entity3 believes will be added by 2050 , more than one billion will live in @entity42			1
the @entity20 subcontinent will add some 630 million people			1
it will mean less land and water available for each person			1
poorer people , who tend to depend more on natural resources , will bear the brunt as they will not be able to compete with the rich			2
the major issues will be how to feed the new arrivals , which will see the need for new varieties of improved crops			2
ageing populations are also set to pose a problem with some industrial countries , such as @entity61 , nearly doubling its share of the population aged 65 and over in the past 20 years			2
this will put increased pressure on pension and healthcare systems			1
the report states : ' another two billion people may be added to the world population by mid-century , many of them in places where hunger , poverty , and environmental degradation are already taking a high toll			2
' supporting the world ’s human population will mean eliminating poverty , transitioning to an economy that is in sync with the earth , and securing every person ’s health , education , and reproductive choice			2
' if we do not voluntarily stabilize population , we risk a much less humane end to growth as the ongoing destruction of the earth ’s natural systems catches up with us			2
' but despite the problems the world is facing , under - secretary - general of the @entity3 dr @entity95 said the seventh billion child of the world has a better chance than decade ago of surviving past the age of five than a decade ago			0
the life expectancy for both women and men has also increased in every @entity107 and @entity108 country during the past decade , dr @entity95 added			0
and although the pace of development is 1.1 per cent in 2011 - meaning an extra 78 million people will live on the planet by the end of this year - it has slowed down slightly from its peak of 2 per cent in 1968			0
professor @entity116 , from the department of economics and demographics at @entity120 , said in a report earlier this year that the issues would also affect developed countries			0
he said : ' population trends indicate a shift in the ' demographic centre of gravity ' from more to less developed regions			0
' already strained , many developing countries will likely face tremendous difficulties in supplying food , water , housing , and energy to their growing populations , with repercussions for health , security , and economic growth			1
' the demographic picture is indeed complex , and poses some formidable challenges			0
' those challenges are not insurmountable , but we can not deal with them by sticking our heads in the sand			0
' we have to tackle some tough issues ranging from the unmet need for contraception among hundreds of millions of women and the huge knowledge - action gaps we see in the area of child survival , to the reform of retirement policy and the development of global immigration policy			0
' it 's just plain irresponsible to sit by idly while humankind experiences full force the perils of demographic change			0
' @entity163 is mirroring the world 's expansion			0
in 1801 , its population was 10.5 million - and is now close to 62.5 million .			0
