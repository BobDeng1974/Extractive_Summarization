the view of the @entity1 against the @entity3 skyline is breathtaking on an ordinary day , but the @entity6 capital was recently bathed in a rare horizontal rainbow			1
across the city 's horizon a clear spectrum of colours emerged for a short time , in a natural phenomenon known as a fire rainbow			2
@entity3 @entity15 , 33 , spotted the unusual display out of the window of his apartment in @entity6 's capital on march 17			1
a horizontal rainbow , known as a fire rainbow , is pictured above the @entity3 skyline by @entity3 @entity15 horizontal rainbows , or circumhorizon arcs , occur when cirrus clouds are elevated enough to form plate - shaped ice crystals amateur photographer mr @entity15 said : ‘ i have never seen a rainbow like that before			1
this light phenomenon looked like a rising aurora over @entity3			2
' when i saw it , i had to react very fast			2
i was very impressed by this beauty and i knew that i could not miss it			0
’ the display was only visible for a short time , but mr @entity15 quickly grabbed his camera and captured the rare sight			0
fire rainbows are a common sight in the @entity40 but are rarer in northern @entity41 because the sun is not often at the right angle to create the effect the horizontal rainbow was brought on by heavy rainstorms abd stormy weather that lashed @entity3 last week he added : ‘ it was only possible to see it for few minutes			1
often i am waiting to catch some weather pictures			0
every day i hope to see some atmospheric phenomenons like that			0
‘ the day was tormented with a stormy sky			0
even in a big city it 's possible to see some amazing natural phenomenon			0
‘ it was a very turbulent day and i will remember it for a long time			0
’ the horizontal rainbow was brought on by heavy rainstorms that lashed @entity3 last week			2
fire rainbows , known by the proper name of circumhorizon arc , occur when cirrus clouds are far enough up in the air to form plate - shaped ice crystals			1
they are not actually rainbows , but a halo effect , although they are commonly referred to as fire rainbows			1
when the sun is at the right angle it hits the top of these plates and splits into different colours that are viewable on the ground			0
although such fire rainbows are relatively common in the @entity40 , they are a rarer sight in northern @entity41 where the sun less frequently has the required elevation needed for it to occur			1
the effect only lasted for a few minutes so @entity15 acted quickly to capture the skyline vista @entity15 captured the dramatic skies of @entity3 during the storm which led to the rare fire rainbow over the city			1
