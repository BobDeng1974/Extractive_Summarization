one @entity1 dad was shocked to receive a letter from his daughter 's substitute teacher telling him he had packed her a lunch that was too unhealthy			1
the girl 's father @entity6 , who is a family doctor , posted the letter , written on orange paper to his @entity9 , outraged at the ' @entity11 ' approach from the @entity13 teacher			2
annoyed at the implication he and his wife @entity15 were not up to the task of caring for their own daughter , dr. @entity6 refused to sign the letter acknowledging he accepted the lunch was not up to scratch			1
request declined : dr. and mrs @entity21 were annoyed to get this letter from the substitute teacher at @entity23 on tuesday dr. and mrs @entity21 were shocked to receive the letter on tuesday evening when their daughter , @entity24 , returned home from school			1
it read : '' dr. and mrs. @entity21 , the cafeteria reported to me that @entity24 's lunch today included four chocolate bars , a bag of marshmallows , @entity36 crackers and a pickle			2
please see that she packs a proper lunch tomorrow			0
' the letter then ends with a curt demand - ' parent signature requested '			0
the @entity42 wrote back , ' request declined '			0
what annoyed dr. @entity6 most about the letter was the judgmental tone it struck , leaving him in no doubt his parenting skills were under question			1
ordinary parents : dr. @entity6 and @entity21 were handed the letter to them by their daughter @entity24 and asked to acknowledge the receipt of the note with their signature			1
they refused family fun : @entity6 and @entity15 are pictured here on a day out to @entity60 with their four children , including @entity24 , ( left ) bad lunch : @entity24 's lunch on tuesday did not conform with the dietary standards of the substitute at @entity23 smiling faces : the @entity6 children are seen here ( @entity24 is left ) and all seem to be pictures of health ' unfortunately , the letter did n't have what she had , correctly			1
she had four pieces of ham , a whole protein meat , she also had some pickles , which we admittedly cheat on pickles every once and awhile as a vegetable , because some fights just are n't worth having , ' said dr. @entity6			1
' she also had four marshmallows in a @entity85 bag and then she had three very small pieces of chocolate , of which she ate one for lunch and then she also gave her brother and another friend one at an after school program , ' @entity6 said to @entity92			2
while dr. @entity6 was contacted by the school principal , @entity93 on wednesday and apologized to , he still feels mildly slighted			2
' the issue is n't what happened at the @entity13 and with my daughter because she is very independent and going to be completely unaffected by this			0
but what does bother me is that it just seems that we are constantly being inundated with the inability to be parents of our children , ' @entity6 added according to @entity92			2
apologetic : principal @entity93 phoned dr. @entity6 on wednesday afternoon to say sorry for the substitute 's ' overreach ' for demanding the @entity6 's pack their daughter a healthier lunch @entity6 told @entity92 3 that as the medical director of the @entity114 clinic in @entity23 , he is very aware of what constitutes a healthy lunch			1
' i 'm responsible for them and for the choices that they make and do whether it 's at school or not			0
' i have the ultimate responsibility to raise my children and i take that role very , very seriously and so maybe i took it bit more personally that there was some offense that maybe i was n't doing a good job in that duty , something that is my number one job , ' @entity6 said to @entity92			0
he also said that he accepted the school 's apology and that of @entity134 superintendent dr. @entity133 , who also released a statement			0
' we have as educators been directed to provide healthy and nutritious foods for so long that we had an individual take it upon themselves to send a note home to parents			0
this will not happen again and i am sorry for any inconvenience			0
