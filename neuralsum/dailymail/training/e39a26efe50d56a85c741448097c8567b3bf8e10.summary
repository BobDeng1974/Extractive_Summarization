day care owners who spent 21 years in prison before being freed amid questions over their convictions for child abuse involving satanic rituals are struggling to convince prosecutors that they should be fully exonerated			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , who divorced in prison , were freed on bond last year when the only physical evidence against them was found to be a mistake			1
but prosecutors say to overcome a jury finding of guilt , the courts require new evidence that unquestionably establishes innocence such as an ironclad alibi or dna proof			0
fighting to clear his name : @entity9 , 73 , has appealed for a court to declare him innocent			0
he was released from jail in @entity26 , @entity27 , in 2013 after 21 years amid doubts over his sexual abuse conviction the couple had been convicted in 1992 after therapists testified that they helped three children recover memories of satanic rituals and sexual abuse at an @entity26 preschool the @entity37 operated			1
however , an appeal found the only physical evidence came from an emergency room doctor who testified that internal lacerations on one child were evidence of abuse			1
and children whose testimony led to a conviction have since claimed they were pressured to lie			2
the @entity37 , who always denied the charges , want the courts to throw out their convictions			2
but a year after they were freed from prison , @entity54 prosecutors remain unwilling to proclaim them innocent , the @entity52 reported sunday			0
' our responsibility is to make sure the law is properly applied , and , under the applicable standards , we are not satisfied that they have established actual innocence under the law , ' @entity54 assistant district attorney @entity56 said			0
that standard seems unfair to @entity9 , who said there is no way to conclusively prove a negative			0
' it 's so hard to prove you 're innocent when there was never a crime , ' she said			0
the @entity37 had been sentenced to 48 years in prison			2
but in court documents filed in 2013 , dr. @entity73 says what he thought were lacerations were actually normal physiology			0
that prompted prosecutors in @entity54 , which includes @entity26 , to agree that the case 's evidence was faulty and release the two on bond			2
evidence needed : @entity9 and her ex-husband need concrete evidence proving their innocence to overthrow the jury 's guilty verdict			1
the pair were jailed for allegedly engaging in satanic rituals and abuse the @entity95 ' claim of innocence will be decided by the @entity97 , where a core of conservative judges typically takes a skeptical view toward overturning jury verdicts			1
the court will be guided by the recommendations of senior district judge @entity104 , who presided over the @entity37 ' 1992 trial and their recent appeals — and who has already twice ruled that they had failed to prove their innocence			1
@entity9 's attorney , @entity108 , said : ' the case was a true witch hunt because the investigators actually believed that this was part of a wide satanic conspiracy			2
' he said the therapist 's techniques — which were used to convince the children , parents and investigators that the @entity95 committed human sacrifices , sexually abused them with pens and dismembered human bodies in cemeteries — have been debunked			1
the @entity37 were sentenced after just a six - day trial , according to @entity124			1
the couple were among hundreds of childcare workers who were accused of being part of a group of @entity130 worshipers who engaged in ritual child abuse across @entity132 during the 1980s and 1990s			1
' the @entity9 case is definitely about the panic back then , ' said @entity108			0
between 1984 to 1989 , some 100 people nationwide were charged with ritual sex abuse and 50 were put on trial , according to @entity138 of the @entity139 , which works to free those wrongly imprisoned			0
many have since questioned a number of the cases , which they said were based on faulty testimony coaxed out of children from purported experts on recovered memories and backed by dubious medical testimony on signs of sexual abuse .			0

@entity97 needs concrete evidence proving innocence to overthrow verdict
@entity8 and @entity9 were both sentenced to 48 - year jail terms in 1992 for alleged child abuse at a day care they ran out of their @entity26 , @entity27 , home
six - day trial had heard the children were sexually abused with pens and *flown* to @entity165 where the @entity37 watched as *soldiers* abused them
@entity168 found there was only one piece of physical evidence which the doctor later **retracted** , and the children said that they were pressured to lie
@entity9 was freed on *november* 26 , 2013 , and @entity8 on *december* 5 , 2013
their case came amid a wave of fear about satanic rituals at day cares in the late 1980s and 1990s across @entity132 , many convictions since **retracted**
