by @entity0 for most toddlers , the odd sweet is a treat			0
but for @entity6 , just one mouthful of the wrong food could be deadly			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , is so allergic to everything he comes into contact with he has to wear mittens to stop him from scratching the painful hives which he battles on a daily basis			1
if fed citric acid , a common food additive found in soft drinks and sweets , or bread , the toddler could face losing his sight permanently or even death if he did n't have his @entity23			1
@entity6 , with mother @entity24 , has so many allergies that he can only eat 11 foods @entity6 , now 18 months , suffers such bad reactions to certain foods that he scratches his skin raw and to prevent the long list of other dangerous allergies from flaring up , @entity6 is only allowed to eat just 11 ' safe ' foods			1
his mother @entity33 , 28 , first noticed her son 's allergies when he was just two months old after the skin around his eyes became severely infected			1
doctors prescribed steroids to try and calm down the reactions , but @entity6 continued to suffer painful breakouts which would leave the skin on his face raw and paper thin			1
mrs @entity45 said : ' when he first started showing signs of allergies , i would put little baby mittens on him so he would n't scratch			2
' but he would itch so bad he would use the entire mitten to rub his face raw			2
' i did n't have a clue what foods he was allergic to , so he would itch and scratch all night until he bled			2
' by the time we got up in the morning it looked as if someone had been murdered in the bed			0
' a dermatologist suggested that @entity6 might be allergic to citric acid , as the attacks seemed to coincide			1
but even after another serious breakout of hives , mrs @entity45 claims aims that doctors refused to give @entity6 an allergy test , saying he was too young			2

' that is too much for a baby to go through and by this point , i felt totally hopeless			0
there was nothing i could do			0
' but by the time @entity6 was 15 months old , she had managed to book an appointment with a skin specialist			1
' she cried when she saw @entity6 and immediately approved him for a blood test , ' mrs @entity123 said			2
@entity6 tested positive for 46 allergies , including citric acid , potatoes , nuts , wheat and dairy and was referred to a paediatrician , a dermatologist , an allergist and a nutritionist to help keep his allergies at bay			1

' the toddler 's mother first noticed her son 's allergies when he was just two months old after the skin around his eyes became severely infected @entity6 's strict diet now consists of just 11 items : @entity152 , string beans , carrots , apples , grapes , pears , greens , kale , beetroot , broccoli , and allergen - free cereal over the past few months , she has finally identified a narrow list of low - reaction foods which are safe for her son to eat			1

his mother said : ' things have got better , but something as simple as a soft drink could leave him blinded for life			0
' @entity6 's actually very good about not eating things he 's allergic to but it 's difficult to keep an eye on him all the time			1
' i could n't even count the number of times i 've had to tell people he 's not allowed to eat candy or cookies			0
