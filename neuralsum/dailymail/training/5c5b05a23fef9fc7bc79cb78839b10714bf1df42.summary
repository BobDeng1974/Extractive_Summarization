controversial scientist @entity0 provoked fury yesterday after referring to ‘ mild date rape ’ and ‘ mild paedophilia ’ in comments on @entity5			1
campaigners for women and child abuse victims condemned the prominent atheist ’s posts as ‘ offensive and damaging ’			1
professor @entity0 , 73 , became embroiled in the row when he made a point about logical thinking to almost a million followers on the social networking site			1
he used the shocking examples as a way to illustrate a type of logical argumen where a comparison does not act as an endorsement provocative : professor @entity0 's comments sparked fury on the social network where one user accused him of being ' a danger to women ' while another urged him to ' learn compassion ' the academic sparked anger by choosing the example of sexual abuse to illustrate the idea			1
he began by writing : ‘ x is bad			0
if you think that ’s an endorsement of @entity39 , go away and do n’t come back until you ’ve learned how to think logically			0
’ then he added : ‘ mild pedophilia [ sic ] is bad			2
if you think that ’s an endorsement of mild pedophilia , go away and learn how to think			2
‘ date rape is bad			2
stranger rape at knifepoint is worse			2
if you think that ’s an endorsement of date rape , go away and learn how to think			2
’ despite coming under fire from scores of other @entity5 users , the evolutionary biologist refused to change the topic			2
he went on to write : ‘ mild date rape is bad			1
violent date rape is worse			1
is it really so hard to understand that that does n’t constitute endorsement of either ? ’ backlash : some of the tweets written in response to @entity0			1
many were outraged by his apparently casual use of rape , and argued that they made light of the suffering victims endured the professor finally withdrew from the argument after tweeting : ‘ what i have learned today is that there are people on @entity5 who think in absolutist terms , to an extent i would n’t have believed possible			1
’ but @entity79 , chief executive of the @entity80 for people abused in @entity82 , said the scientist had belittled the ‘ devastating ’ effect of sexual abuse			0
' date rape is bad			2
stranger rape at knifepoint is worse			2
if you think that ’s an endorsement of date rape , go away and learn how to think ' @entity0 he said : ‘ what staggers me is that for such a self - proclaimed intelligent man to even talk in these terms is to completely miss the point			1
' there is no such thing as mild or serious paedophilia			1
there is child abuse , and the consequence for the victim is that they can be scarred for life			0
’ @entity105 , co-director of the @entity106 , said professor @entity0 had ‘ minimised ’ abuse in his remarks			1
‘ @entity0 is not just engaging in light - hearted philosophical discussion when he talks of “ mild date rape ” and “ mild paedophilia ” , but minimising these serious offences , ’ she said			1
@entity113 , of the human rights group @entity114 , said even the most intelligent @entity5 users should sometimes ‘ put their smartphones down and count to 250 ’ before commenting on such sensitive topics			0
response : @entity0 sent this tweet towards the end of the lively online debate , mocking some of the harsh criticism he had received ‘ there is no mild rape , there is no mild paedophilia			1
these are terrible , terrible crimes , ’ she told the @entity126 website			0
professor @entity0 , an @entity132 at @entity133 , @entity134 , has previously triggered outrage with comments about child abuse			1
' what staggers me is that for such a self - proclaimed intelligent man to even talk in these terms is to completely miss the point ' @entity79 , @entity143 in @entity82 he said in an interview last year that he could not condemn the ‘ mild paedophilia ’ he experienced at boarding school , adding : ‘ we must beware of lumping all paedophiles into the same bracket			1
’ however in a statement on his website last night , he said he ‘ was only talking logic ’ , and had ‘ no desire to make light of the seriousness of any kind of rape or [ sic ] pedophilia ’			2
in 2011 , the then justice secretary @entity159 faced a backlash after referring to ‘ serious rape ’ in a @entity163 interview			0
he later stressed that ‘ all rape is a serious crime ’ and that he had used the ‘ wrong choice of words ’			0
controversial : @entity0 professor @entity0 has a history of sparking debate with his controversial views			1
in the past he has claimed that forcing a religion on children without questioning its merits was as bad as ' child abuse '			0
the leading atheist said he was against the ' indoctrination of religion ' and teaching it as fact			0
professor @entity0 's best - selling book @entity182 argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society			1
in an interview , he claimed he had been told by a woman that while being abused by a priest was a ‘ yucky ’ experience , being told as a child that a @entity194 friend who died would ‘ roast in @entity192 ’ was more distressing			0
in remarks to @entity197 - based tv network @entity196 , he said : ‘ horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was , the damage was arguably less than the long - term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up @entity203 in the first place			0
' last month he told an audience at the @entity206 that fairy tales and believing in @entity208 could cause children harm			0
he suggested it was ' pernicious to instil in a child the view that the world is shaped by supernaturalism			0
' in 2013 he made headlines when he wrote on @entity5 that a single college at @entity217 had won more @entity218 than all the world ’s @entity219			0
his comments sparked fury on the social network where he was accused of disguising his ‘ bigotry ’ as atheism			0
he responded to the barrage of ensuing criticism by telling his 782,000 followers : ‘ a statement of simple fact is not bigotry			0
and science by @entity219 was great in the distant past			0
’ he also declared victory for @entity234 after he had a jar of honey confiscated while he was going through airport security last november			0
last september , professor @entity0 was once again embroiled in controversy when he said that it was important to distinguish between varying levels of paedophilia , and that cases involving rape and murder should not be compared to ' mild touching up ' .			1

professor @entity0 used shocking rape examples to *explain* logical argument
the *outspoken* biologist also compared ' mild ' and ' violent ' paedophilia
one user called him a ' danger to women ' while others came to his *defence*
he has previously called for *recognition* of varying levels of paedophilia
