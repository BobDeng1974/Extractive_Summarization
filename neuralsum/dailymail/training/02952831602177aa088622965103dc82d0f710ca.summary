' it was excessive how they ( the police ) did it to me			1
if i did something wrong , i could understand , but i did n’t			0
' they make me feel shame , ' he added			0
' i was very humiliated			0
' cops recently stepped up their presence at the corner of @entity40 and @entity41 after a series of traffic incidents involving pedestrians			0
mr @entity6 told the @entity13 he became an unwitting victim to their overzealous policing			1

when he reached the other side he was met by a police officer asking for identification , he said			1
the retiree admitted that he does not speak much @entity60 , but that he did understand the request			2
the cop took his id and walked away , confusing the grandfather and causing him to ask for it back - in @entity65			2
according to one witness , several officers quickly converged on the man , who did n't seem to understand @entity60 - language commands , after he simply tried to walk away ' i was very puzzled and i was very scared , ' said mr @entity6			1
' i had no idea why i had been stopped			0
i used @entity65 and said give me back my @entity63			0
' the officer responded by quickly pulling out his handcuffs and calling into his radio , according to mr @entity6 and eyewitness accounts			1
several more officers raced over and threw him against the side of a building			2
' i got more scared , ' he recalled			0
police then threw him to the ground and slapped cuffs on him			2
mr @entity6 says he blacked out during the rough treatment and woke up with his hands cuffed behind his back and blood streaming down his face , pictures taken at the scene confirm at least that much			1
according to one witness , several officers quickly converged on the man , who did n’t seem to understand @entity60 - language commands , after he simply tried to walk away			1
cop haunt : mr @entity6 owned this restaurant until retiring , he said police frequently ate there on the scene : police commissioner @entity99 ( center ) initially praised officers for their actions but has sine said he is awaiting the results of an @entity106 investigation ‘ the guy did n’t seem to speak @entity60 , ’ @entity107 , a 24 - year - old @entity108 law student , told the @entity109			1
‘ he [ the officer ] stood him up against the wall and was trying to write him a ticket			2
the man did n’t seem to understand , and he started walking away			0
’ that ’s when the officer and several colleagues quickly converged on the senior citizen and left him badly beaten and bloodied			1
‘ the cop tried to pull him back and that ’s when he [ the pedestrian ] began to struggle with the cop , ’ said mr @entity107			0
‘ as soon as he pushed the cop , it was like cops started running in from everywhere			0
’ police commissioner @entity99 initially praised the arrest , tweeting the commander did an ' excellent job ' and saying at a news conference ' i ’m not aware of excessive force in that at all			2
' he has since deleted the tweet and the @entity133 's @entity106 division is looking into the arrest			0
law enforcement in the area had earlier promised to step - up enforcement of the law after three pedestrians were struck and killed within a two - block radius in the neighborhood in nine days , but mr @entity6 's lawyer says increased vigilance should n't result in decreased dignity			1
' we can have police efforts focused on pedestrian safety without violating the civil rights of our citizens , ' attorney @entity145 told the paper			1
the former restauranteur says he immigrated from @entity153 to @entity154 at age 19 , and then later to @entity3 where he eventually opened a restaurant after working his way up from washing dishes			2
