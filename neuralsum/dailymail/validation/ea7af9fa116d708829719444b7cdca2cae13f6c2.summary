@entity1 manager @entity0 has questioned the long - term effects of holding the @entity3 in the winter			1
the final of the showpiece event in @entity7 is to be on sunday , december 18 - a decision which will allow traditional @entity10 club matches to take place in @entity12 and avoid the fierce heat of june and july			1
it will be a shortened tournament over 28 days instead of the usual 32 , starting on november 21			1
december 18 is also @entity7 's national day			1
@entity0 has expressed concern over the plans to play the @entity18 in winter the @entity1 manager watches on during his side 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity22 on wednesday night however , @entity0 is concerned how @entity24 games , which would usually be scheduled for november and december , will be caught up later in the season and the impact of doing so on the next domestic campaign			1
' i think it is difficult to stop all the @entity31 leagues in that month , especially in our league at this moment , and not play football here in november and december , ' @entity0 said			1
' when you recover those amount of games what will happen in the next season , when you finish late , how many days the national squad will need their players ? ' i do n't think it is easy			1
it is a big task			2
' @entity46 manager @entity45 echoed @entity0 's thoughts , but conceded that teams would just have to ' get on with it '			1
@entity46 boss @entity45 says the break will be strange but the clubs will just have to get on with it @entity53 says teams around @entity55 will have to adapt to the affect of a winter @entity3 ' it will be strange having a two - month break in the middle of the season			1
i 'm not sure how that 's going to work and i 'd have to see the exact lay - out of it , but i do n't think it 's a great thing , ' he said			2
' it 's beyond the powers of @entity46 , but i ca n't imagine too many teams are happy with it			2
but it sounds as if we 're just going to have to get on with it			2
' @entity72 boss @entity53 conceded the tournament moving to november would need plenty of adaptation , but he always expected a @entity3 in @entity7 to be held over the winter			1
' you need clarity and then you can prepare towards that , ' @entity53 said			2
' but i always felt that once it was given to @entity7 it was going to be a winter @entity3			0
' when all the talk is about wanting the @entity3 in different continents and different countries , and when the hosts are going to be @entity7 , it 's only normal that it 's going to be played in the winter			0
' that 's going to affect two or three seasons around that date , but we need to adapt and make it a big football celebration like the @entity3 's supposed to be			0
' @entity95 boss @entity94 says playing the @entity3 in the winter is the only sensible solution @entity95 manager @entity94 thinks a @entity3 late in the year is a sensible move in such a hot climate , but took the chance to push for a winter break			1
he said : ' we 've got plenty of time to adapt			0
i 've always said in this country we need a break , we should copy everyone else			1
when you see other teams come back there 's a freshness about them because of the winter break			2
' we 've got plenty of time to put the schedule in			0
once @entity118 picked @entity7 there was only one solution and they 've picked the sensible one			0
' @entity122 manager @entity121 agreed			0
' whichever way you try to cook it they have worked it to suit the country at the best possible time			0
they have moved everything around to suit them , full stop , ' he said			0
' they are the governing body and , irrespective of what you do say and do n't say , there might be loads of people unhappy with it , but they have got it through and it 's been agreed			0
' everyone has to get on with it			0
what will be the situation in @entity147 , is everything is going to have to be reorganised and revamped ? that 's going to be interesting			0

@entity18 will take place from november 21 to december *19*
the @entity24 will break *mid-season* between these dates
@entity0 does not think it *'ll* be easy to recover the *missed* games
