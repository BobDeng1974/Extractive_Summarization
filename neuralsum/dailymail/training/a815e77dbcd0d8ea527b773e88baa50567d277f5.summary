@entity0 was ecstatic after seeing his @entity2 team end @entity4 's unbeaten start to the season with a 2 - 1 win on saturday - but was bemused after fourth official @entity7 added six minutes of injury time			1
@entity11 's men halved @entity2 's advantage through a @entity14 strike on 83 minutes but as the clock reached 90 , @entity9 was left roaring in fury as another six minutes were added on			1
and it reminded @entity19 boss @entity0 of visiting @entity20 under sir @entity22 's tenure			2
' i was very disappointed with the six minutes because as the home team i ’ve never had that			0
' but @entity0 made time to credit referee @entity41 for allowing @entity2 to play on after a foul on @entity43 , as the move ended in @entity28 's second goal of the game			2
' i have to pay tribute to him as well because the foul on @entity43 , he plays on and we get the second goal			0
you have got to take everything into account , ' @entity0 said			0
despite @entity4 's first defeat of the season handing second - placed @entity56 the opportunity to narrow the gap between the two sides to three points when they take on @entity61 later on saturday , @entity0 still believes @entity4 will win the @entity62			1
@entity11 saw his side lose their first game of the season against @entity2 on saturday @entity28 ( centre ) scored both goals of the game to inspire @entity2 to victory at @entity9 @entity70 ( left ) , @entity14 ( centre ) and goalkeeper @entity72 ( right ) walk off the pitch ' that was about character ( and ) discipline against the best team probably in @entity78 at the moment , ' @entity0 added			1
' they had chances , so you have to ride your luck , you need everything to go your way if you are going to beat a team as good as them			0
' they 're consistently great , a consistently brilliant side and they ’ll take some stopping still to win the league but today was our day			0

@entity2 hand @entity4 first defeat of the season at @entity9
but @entity2 *manager* @entity0 *blasts* the six minutes of added time
@entity0 still believes @entity11 's side will win the @entity62
