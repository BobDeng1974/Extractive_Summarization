after decades in the doldrums , eggs appear to have a cracking future			0
consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014 , which equates to an extra 700,000 that are boiled , scrambled and fried every day of the week			1
it is a remarkable resurgence for the egg , which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s when the nation was happy to ‘ go to work on an egg ’			1
the revival is being attributed to the fact they form a central part of protein - rich diets such at @entity19 and @entity20 , which promise weight loss and even a longer life			1
consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014 , the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day			1
experts are crediting the revival with the rise of protein - rich diets including @entity19 and @entity20 as a result , egg sales are now finally back to the levels seen in the 1980s when the former @entity34 health minister @entity33 infamously labelled them a health threat because of salmonella contamination			1
that attack fuelled existing concerns about eggs , which were also being demonised by doctors for containing high levels of cholesterol , which was wrongly assumed to fur up the arteries			1
however , the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens , with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g , which is a third of the recommended daily limit			2
at the same time , @entity51 , which is vital for healthy bones , is up by 64 per cent compared to a decade ago			0
the net result is that eggs are now being actively promoted as a health food given they are also full of the protein , vitamins , minerals and essential fatty acids that are vital to a healthy body			1
until 2009 , @entity63 were warned against eating more than three eggs a week because of the worries about cholesterol – but this warning has now been junked			2
research by experts at @entity70 found overweight people given two eggs a day as part of a reduced calorie diet lost weight and saw no increase in blood cholesterol levels			1
if you are looking for a loan , serving your bank manager breakfast might just do the trick			0
a compound found in eggs makes people much more generous , new research suggests			0
scientists say that tryptophan , an amino acid found in some foods , can change our behaviour			0
in experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity			2
eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan , an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel - good chemical serotonin			2
and the @entity105 has recently recommended that limitations on consumption of cholesterol found in eggs should be removed from official health guidelines			1
it stated : ‘ cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity116 said : ‘ health professionals ’ recognition of their health benefits , and the end of the confusion over their effect on cholesterol , mean eggs are now being widely recommended as part of a healthy diet			2
‘ they are also included in all major slimming plans , from established groups such as @entity131 and @entity132 , to more recent trends such as the @entity19 and @entity20 diets			1
’ egg consumption has also been boosted by the trend to eat breakfast at dinner under the rise of the ‘ @entity140 ’ – a trend that has been imported from @entity142			2
in total , 32 million eggs were eaten every day in the @entity63 in 2014 , equivalent to 11.7 billion throughout the whole year			1
‘ consumption from retail purchases exceeded six billion for the first time in 2014 , having grown 16 per cent in the past five years , ’ said the spokesman , adding that consumption had returned to levels last seen before the salmonella crisis of the late 1980s			1
the details were reported by @entity153 , which said sales have also been helped by supermarket promotions and price cuts			0
data obtained from retail analyst @entity158 shows that , in the 52 weeks to the end of february , the @entity161 retail market for eggs was up 2.4 per cent in volume terms			0
the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens , with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g , which is a third of the recommended daily limit however , the supermarket price cuts meant the actual value of these sales fell by a significant 4.8 per cent to £ 768m			2
@entity175 , chairman of the @entity116 , said he anticipated another year of rising consumption in 2015 , pointing to the sector ’s first tv advertising in 10 years , as well as a new @entity179 in minutes recipe campaign fronted by fitness entrepreneur and celebrity @entity182			0
a fan of the @entity140 trend , she said : ‘ i ’ll often eat eggs for dinner when i get home from a work out in the evening			0
they are quick , nutritious and not to mention tasty			0
’ the @entity192 eggs tv advertising campaign featured commercials by @entity194 winning @entity195 , director of @entity196			0
it was launched alongside the eggrecipes.co.uk website , which offers advice on everything from how to boil an egg to get a soft runny centre to more exotic soufflé frittatas , flamenco eggs and desserts .			0
