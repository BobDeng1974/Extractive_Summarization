it may sound like something from biblical times , but in fact it is accusations which have been made against @entity15 bishop @entity14 , 66 , who is said to have been behind the beard cutting gang who are due to go on trial for aggravated burglary and kidnapping			1
the recent bizarre attacks have thrust this ferociously private community into the spotlight , with horror stories emerging of rape , beatings , brainwashing and kidnapping			1
the man , who did not want to be named , told @entity46 that @entity14 moved to @entity47 about 15 years ago with around 120 member who all have to live by his rules			1
he compared the sect to the former @entity51 , whose leader was @entity53			2
in 1978 , the cult ended in a mass suicide in @entity56 , @entity57			1
he told the tv channel : ' i 'm not surprised if i have to call the sheriff some day and say there are a lot of dead people lying around here			2
that would not be a surprise to me nor would it be a surprise to the sheriff of that county			2
' i have enough inside information that i have no question if something is not done , there will be people that get hurt			2
' the former member says there were forced beatings , pitting one member against another and there are heavy punishments when members disagree with bishop @entity14			1
arrested : @entity83 ( left ) and @entity84 ( right ) were arrested in @entity85 for the alleged role in crimes by ' the @entity88 ' he said : ' he would take the wife from the man			2
the wife would have to go and live with @entity14			1
the husband of that wife would have to go to the chicken coop or out in the barn in the middle of the winter , sometimes day and night			2
' one of the woman , whose husband @entity99 had his beard cut off by the gang earlier this month , said she heard many stories about the ' brainwashing , the beatings , the locking up , and the women he is using '			1
@entity107 said she and her husband helped one of @entity14 's sons - @entity112 - escape from the clan and believes that may have been one of the reasons why he was attacked			1
@entity119 , friends of the @entity117 who witnessed the attack , told @entity120 that he once drove @entity14 and about 15 other men and women to @entity14 's chiropractor			1
he said he overheard a conversation between one young woman and the 66 - year - old leader			2
' she said in @entity128 , which is a @entity130 dialect , " @entity14 , who 's going to see you tonight ? " and then the other women laughed and giggled			1
and i thought , " whoa , wait a minute , is he having sex with all these women ? " ' @entity119 said he has also heard reports of child abuse and daily beatings among the terrified community			1
until recently , the sheriff could do little , because the @entity15 victims chose to shrug off the assaults rather than bring in law enforcement			2
but with a spate of attacks since september , people began to cooperate			0
two of the @entity15 bishop 's 18 children have been infiltrated in the beard cuttings			0
@entity153 and @entity154 will go to trial along with @entity156 and @entity157 and and @entity158			0

their lawyer @entity171 defended the men and said it was them paying their own legal bills and not @entity14 , telling @entity46 : ' the five men i 've met in this case are complete gentlemen with deeply founded @entity180 beliefs			1
' i think a lot of the fear - mongering is being done by others to try to show these gentlemen in a bad light			0
' the experience i 've had with them would cause me no fear at all			0
i 'd have them in my house tomorrow			0
' @entity190 , a @entity191 man from nearby @entity192 , attended the hearing , and said he was concerned about the bad reputation the @entity15 community has been getting because of the alleged actions of @entity14 's followers			1
mr @entity99 said : ' this is not part of what the @entity200 's a good example of how too much power corrupts			0
church followers should not be dominated by one person or one bishop , otherwise you have this			0
' @entity14 denies his clan is a cult but sees value in punishing those who do n't follow church teaching			1
' you do n't obey the law , you 're punished , and it 's the same way with the church , ' @entity14 said			1
the men are said to have acted at the direction of the 66 - year - old over an unspecified dispute about church discipline and practices			0
in the @entity15 community , beards on men and long hair on women have spiritual value , and forcibly cutting either is a symbolic assault meant to denigrate			1

authorities are investigating similar attacks in @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity269 counties , all of which sheriff @entity270 of @entity266 believes were orchestrated by @entity14			1
sheriff @entity270 said he once had a good relationship with @entity14 , but the pair have had many run - ins over the years , including when he prosecuted one of his sons , @entity278 , for raping a 12 - year - old girl			1
the sheriff also claims that @entity14 threatened to kill him and some of his own children nad was once involved in a custody battle			1
he was once committed for a psychiatric examination			0
but @entity285 has denied he ordered the attack , but admitted the goal was to send a message to @entity15 in @entity289 , @entity85 , that they should be ashamed of themselves for the way they were treating @entity14 and his community			1
@entity14 said : ' we 'd like to get up in the morning , be left alone , live like normal people			1
they wo n't leave us be			0
