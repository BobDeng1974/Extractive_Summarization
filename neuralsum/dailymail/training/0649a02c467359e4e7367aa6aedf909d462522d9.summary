' @entity40 have never been more popular , and today we ’ve boosted the performance and lowered the price of @entity4 so even more people can experience the perfect everyday notebook			1
' the low key launch comes amid claims @entity1 has begun manufacturing its much anticipated @entity6 in @entity56			1
according to @entity58 , the wearable is said to take advantage of a manufacturing process called system - in - package which puts all of the watch 's circuitry on a single chip			1
it believes the watch could go on sale later this year , makling an unveiling at @entity1 's annual @entity69 ( @entity69 ) , held in @entity70 from june 2nd , likely			1

@entity56 websites reported in december 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip - maker @entity16 on a wrist - worn gadget			0

other rumours suggest the @entity6 will feature @entity97 voice controls that let users dictate messages , rather than use the tiny screen			1
the watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video , on the phone or tablet			0
in july last year , reports in the @entity108 said @entity1 was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its @entity6			0
@entity1 has refused to hint at what announcement will be made			0

' every year the @entity69 audience becomes more diverse , with developers from almost every discipline you can imagine and coming from every corner of the globe			0

' the conference , aimed at app developers , @entity69 will feature more than 100 technical sessions , and over 1,000 @entity1 engineers will attend to offer help			1
in previous years , the company has unveiled major new versions of its @entity124 and @entity125 software for @entity40 at the event , as well as new @entity94 - although the firm is not expected to unveil these until september this year			1
however , @entity1 fans have not waited for the announcement , and many have released stunning new images of what they believes @entity1 's @entity6 could look like			1
the latest images reveal two models , a luxury @entity77 with a metal case and leather strap , and a plastic @entity148 the incredibly realistic images were mocked up by artist and @entity1 fan @entity71 , and even show how the timepiece would look in @entity1 '' s retail stores			0
the incredibly detailed mockups even reveal how the watch could be displayed in @entity1 's stores the mockups are @entity159 's second attempt at an @entity6 , having worked with @entity161 magazine for the first			2
' right after @entity1 launched the colorful @entity165 i figured it would be nice to have a look at adding color to my original @entity6 concept , ' he said			0
' i added some color , simplified the design and basically turned it into an @entity165 for around your wrist			0
' the latest rumours around the secret smartwatch claim @entity1 has hired a raft of medical and sleep experts to work on its @entity6 project , it has been claimed			2
it is believed the watch will be able to monitor both exercise and sleep , letting wearers track and analyse their every movement			0
although the firm has refused to confirm it is even working on a watch , experts believe it could be released this year			2
the @entity6 c would match @entity1 's iphone 5c perfectly @entity190 reported that @entity191 -- whose background includes working on wearables , sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality -- has joined @entity1 from @entity197			2
the firm is also believed to be developing a special app called @entity200 that will be built into the next version of its @entity124 software , allowing users to track and analyse the data their gadget collect			1
the firm 's @entity206 already has a movement tracking chip , called the @entity209 , which is expected to be used in the @entity6			1
reports in the @entity211 claim the first - generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly , using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases			0
yet future models of the wrist - worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge			0
solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the @entity6 , for example , and harness the sun 's energy			2
the watch imagined by @entity227 has a square screen , while it believed the rear could have sensors to monitor a wearer 's health			2
@entity159 even revealed some advertising concepts he thought @entity1 could use for the @entity6 @entity236 , for example , already uses solar technology in its g - shock range of watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch			0
this is further supported by the fact that in september , @entity1 posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise			2
other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next - generation of @entity1 software , likely to be called @entity124 8			2
another image showing how the @entity6 could look in @entity1 stores all these current claims back up the plans laid out in an @entity1 patent filed in 2011			0
the patent described a ' wearable accessory device ' with a ' flexible display ' that could use the same technology as a child 's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user 's wrist			2
it also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended , including a ' solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device ' , or ' a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches			0
' ' an accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation , and could lengthen the amount of time between charging , ' the application continued			0
similarly , a patent filed in 2009 detailed how @entity1 wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of an arm or leg as the wearer was walking			0
the curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent , awarded last year , which gave @entity1 the option to install a flexible battery into future products			2
last week , reports claimed @entity297 was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next - generation smartwatch , dubbed @entity300 2			0
the original watch launched in september last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life			2
elsewhere , other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen , similar to the concept images pictured , and run the next - generation of @entity1 software , likely to be called @entity124 8 some analysts claimed the device was rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market , beating @entity1 and @entity314 to their respective rumoured devices			0
whereas @entity1 may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much about what customers liked , and did n't like , in the @entity297 version			0
since the first @entity1 @entity6 rumours emerged in 2012 , a number of artists have created concept images of what it may look like			0
@entity1 is rumoured to be working on an alternative way to charge its much - rumoured @entity326 , concept pictured , to remove the need for wires and chargers			1
reports claim the first model will be charged wirelessly , while future models may be powered by solar or kinetic energy many resembled the square and clunky design of @entity297 ’s @entity300 , yet the latest images from @entity338 designer @entity337 imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device			0
@entity337 took inspiration from fitness bands , as well as the look and functionality of @entity1 ’s @entity344 , to create a watch that is ‘ like something @entity1 would actually produce			0
' the concept watch is shown as a simple band , fitted round the wrist like the @entity350 , with a curved touchscreen			0
previous @entity6 concept images , including this one from @entity354 magazine , featured a square screen , and a clunky design , that more closely resembled @entity297 's @entity300 smartwatch			1
