by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 new seasons bring — among other things — opportunities to replenish or repair reputations			2
@entity6 perhaps fits into the latter category			1
the star signing of @entity11 ’ torrid eight months at @entity12 , the @entity9 playmaker failed to such an extent last season that the first thing @entity16 did when handed brief control of the team last april was drop him			1
@entity6 was , quite simply , the signing that never seemed to fit			1
here in @entity20 , though , hope springs for the former @entity23 player			1
new @entity12 manager @entity24 has confided to his associates that the 26 - year - old is the man he wants to play behind @entity27 and @entity28 this season and @entity6 has the look of a footballer ready to make up for lost time			1
‘ we had changed managers but did n’t get the results			2
but we are starting a new season with a new manager and we aim to put the club back where it deserves to be			1
things are changing and everyone is finding their new role in the team			2
’ @entity6 ’s influence at @entity12 in the wake of his arrival last january was negligible			1
when @entity16 was appointed interim manager for the last four games of the season , he was right to leave the @entity60 out			2
good players should influence games wherever they play and @entity6 failed to do that			1
as such , he has much to prove			2
nevertheless , @entity6 ’s cause was not helped by the fact @entity11 did n’t seem to know where to play him			1
often marooned out on the left , he rarely saw any game time behind the two strikers and @entity12 suffered as a result			1
celebration : @entity12 players celebrate scoring their second of the evening in @entity74 partners : @entity6 will get his chance to play the no 10 role this season behind @entity27 and @entity28 @entity79 and altitude affected us - @entity33 under @entity33 , @entity6 has already been stationed in his favourite spot and on saturday against @entity83 he flourished , scoring a lovely goal after a sensational pass from @entity27 in the first half			1
‘ if i play behind the two strikers i feel comfortable , ’ he said			2
‘ i have played on the left or right but my best season was when i played in that position under @entity89 for @entity23			1
i will try my best , during the season hopefully we can play good football and i can do assists and score goals because that is what i have to do			0
‘ we feel the manager is a great manager who has brought a strong mentality			2
this club is made for a winning mentality and i think he has it			0
we are happy with him and the way he works			0
everything is new but we are adapting well to his style of football			0
’ wide of the mark : both @entity11 and @entity109 played @entity6 on the wing , a position he does not enjoy new state of mind : @entity6 in action against @entity83 as part of @entity12 's pre-season tour @entity6 mainly played as a no 10 for @entity89 - where he was more effective - while @entity109 and @entity11 mainly used him out wide			1
under @entity89 ( nov 2012 - may 2013 ) games : 25 goals : 8 assists : 6 chances created : 69 under @entity11 and @entity109 ( june 2013 - may 2014 ) games : 25 goals : 3 assists : 6 chances created : 58 with @entity33 trying to introduce the same playing system at @entity12 he used to take @entity126 to the last four of the @entity127 this summer , @entity6 could be in line to benefit			1
on saturday in sweltering @entity74 , he linked up beautifully with @entity27 and this is an understanding that @entity33 will hope develops over the coming weeks			0
yet @entity12 produced a peculiar display at @entity131			1
they should have been a couple of goals down early on before scoring three times in nine minutes before half - time and then slipping back into a torpor in the second half			2
@entity83 ’s first goal , scored from inside his own half by the @entity142 @entity141 , was a thing of wonder but the more mundane fact is that @entity12 were hanging on at the end			1
‘ we did n’t play a good match , ’ admitted @entity33			0
‘ maybe it was the altitude ... but we scored remarkable goals			0
‘ in the second half we did n’t keep the ball in possession			0
that ’s all we had to do , to keep the ball and make the opponent run and run and run			0
it ’s very difficult for them in the hot weather but we forgot to do that so we brought @entity83 back into the match			0
i am pleased we have won but it was no good			0
no 10 : @entity6 he enjoyed playing for @entity89 because he played him in his favourite position ‘ the club agreed this game before i got here			1
i am not used to the hot weather			0
i was here in 1994 for the @entity127 and games were played at noon			2
it ’s not very wise			0
you have to play football at the right time			0
i ’m sorry to say that			0
’ @entity12 go to @entity172 on monday ahead of a game against @entity174 on tuesday			1
after that comes @entity176 and @entity177 on saturday			0
if they win both they will be obliged to stay in @entity20 three extra days and contest an @entity181 final in @entity182			0
@entity33 continues to sound like a man who just wants to get back to @entity184 and begin preparations for some real football .			0
