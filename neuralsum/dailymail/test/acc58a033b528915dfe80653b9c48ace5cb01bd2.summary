as attempts to break a world record go , it was pretty impressive			0
a @entity4 team took a kite measuring an astonishing 6,000 metres ( 3.7 miles ) to a kite flying festival - aiming to break the world record by a massive 1,000 metres			1
but they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big , it posed a danger to passing aircraft			0
the kite , dubbed ' centipede with a dragon 's head ' , was set to fly at the @entity19 last saturday in @entity20 in south - western @entity4 , according to @entity21			1
the weather at the kite flying festival in @entity20 undoubtedly played a part , with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event			1
each of the 2,000 pieces bears the @entity4 characters ' @entity45 ' and it takes eight hours to get the full - length kite airborne			2
@entity49 , one of the three kite flyers , said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the kite			0
mr @entity49 said : ' @entity57 kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind			0
' in order to secure the pieces on the kite , craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind			0
colourful : kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in @entity20 during the four - day - long festival although the kite did not fly full - length , organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the @entity79 for the longest kite in the world			1
the previous record is reported to set by a 5,000m - long kite made by craftsmen in @entity85 in eastern @entity4 last spring			0
professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the four - day - long @entity19 , including representatives from @entity4 , @entity90 , the @entity91 and @entity92			2
historical : a popular pastime in @entity4 , kite flying dates back some 2,000 years global appeal : professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the festival			1

@entity101 's total length is *6km* ( 3.7 miles ) and is made of 2,000 sections
but only half was allowed to fly after *concerns* from air *traffic* *control*
*appalling* weather conditions meant visibility at kite flying festival in @entity20 was down to 50 metres at times
