he said : ' i always said that , technically and tactically , @entity4 was n’t a normal player in this country – he could have easily fitted into the @entity84 way of playing and also had the ability of the @entity55 side			2
' he is a real example of someone who has the talent but just needs the platform and environment and direction to be allowed to express himself			0
' like for like : @entity4 could be used as a long - term replacement for @entity32 ( right ) last month , after an online campaign was started to keep @entity4 out of the @entity38 squad , @entity8 said : ‘ i do n’t understand it			1
