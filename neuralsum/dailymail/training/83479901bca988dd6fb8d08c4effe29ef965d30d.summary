each night , when the floodlights are switched on at the @entity2 academy in @entity3 , the next generation of @entity6 hopefuls rush out of various meeting rooms and head for the playing surfaces			1
sometimes @entity10 is there , or his mum @entity16 , smiling at @entity13 , @entity14 or @entity15 as they rush past to join in with the various age groups			0
@entity19 ’s grandson , a nifty little midfielder , is also making his way through the academy in @entity6 ’s colours			1
but this is not about celebrity and no - one is at @entity2 to make up the numbers			0
@entity6 academy manager @entity27 ( left ) watching a pre-season friendly with @entity29 @entity27 ( left ) was at @entity30 with @entity31 , where he served as his compatriot 's assistant ( right ) under the club ’s new academy manager @entity27 , who was recruited last season to replace @entity36 after his retirement , @entity6 believe they can shape the future of @entity43 football			1
standards are high and the target is to develop players who will one day take the place of @entity48 , @entity49 or @entity50			1
if they do , it will be done at a fraction of the cost			0
suddenly there is a determination about the place to produce some special players , technically and physically proficient enough to bring them through the system with some modern coaching methods			2
@entity27 was introduced to @entity6 supporters last night , interviewed in the matchday programme after settling in to his new role			1
‘ i have come into another culture , another society in @entity43 and another football society , which is typical here and different to other countries , ’ was one of his first observations			0
it is @entity27 ’s job to realign @entity6 ’s youth teams with the best teams on the continent			1
when @entity36 left at the end of last season , @entity27 was invited to the former academy director ’s farewell bbq with staff from the club			1
he said just two words : ‘ improve it			0
’ that is the ambition around the place , with a new voice dedicating to bringing through the next generation of players who can fit in to the @entity6 way			1
when the young players arrive for the start of their three - hour long training session , they are taken aside and told what will be expected of them that evening			2
@entity27 , a @entity96 coach with experience of working alongside @entity31 at @entity98 and @entity30 , is driving this project home			1
there was a time when the academy system in @entity43 football was ruled by the biggest boys			0
@entity6 want their players to have the biggest brains , cultivating them with first class coaching and encouraging to pick up the habits that can lead to a career in the game			1
on the continent , as @entity27 conceded in his interview , they are streets ahead in terms of developing players at youth level			1
@entity6 are doing their bit to change it , taking the responsibility of bringing @entity43 players through			2
good on them for that			0
@entity6 have brought through some greats , such as @entity123 , @entity36 , @entity124 and @entity125 as well as @entity126 in the current side , but the sport has changed , with tactics , systems and emotional intelligence playing an increasing part in the modern game			1
@entity123 ( right ) was @entity6 captain for more than a decade after coming through the ranks @entity124 is hated by @entity135 now but was loved for being a @entity137 lad and academy graduate @entity126 , the latest high - profile graduate of the academy , in @entity141 action against @entity142 @entity6 , under the guidance of @entity27 and his @entity96 assistants @entity145 and @entity146 , are adapting to the demands			1
they know the kids watch @entity149 or play @entity150 on their playstations , picking up the skills refined by @entity153 , @entity154 , or even @entity155 during his time as an @entity6 player			2
the biggest problem is converting the ability , teaching players when to lay off the ball and when to pull out @entity164 ’s @entity163 trick , @entity166 ’s legendary turn or @entity168 ’s twisting runs			0
most players can learn these skills over time , but working out when to use them , at the very highest levels in youth football , is a lot tougher			0
at @entity6 , they want it ingrained			2
this is a new philosophy , a new approach			0
the squads are streamlined and some of the groups have as few as 10 kids			0
the young players , those who have yet to hit their teens , spend more time practising one - on - one drills , two - on - one or three - on - two to give them more time working with the ball and learning how to win it back			2
centre half @entity184 comes away with the ball against the @entity142 at the @entity187 @entity188 , @entity189 , ( @entity191 ) @entity190 , @entity184 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 ( @entity195 ) , @entity197 ( @entity196 ) , @entity126 , @entity198 , @entity49			2
( @entity6 academy graduates in bold ) they are too young to absorb too much information about game intelligence , particularly after a long day at school			1
the older kids can soak up a bit more , listening intently and learning how to play the game			0
every position on the field has minimum expectations and @entity6 ’s young players must adapt to these principles			1
most of the kids have come straight from school , sometimes an hour long journey away and ferried to east @entity137 by their parents			0
on the sidelines , they have to keep the peace			0
shouting is not tolerated at @entity2			0
the guidance and instruction is for the coaches , explaining each session to the kids before it is delivered in a series of pre-planned exercises			0
the @entity226 , who are watching closely , hope @entity6 can crack it			2

@entity6 trying to bring through young *talent* at @entity232

@entity6 's *homegrown* recent stars *include* @entity126 and @entity124
