the small foam pieces used to protect fragile goods in boxes could soon power your phone thanks to a battery breakthrough			1
researchers have developed a way of turning the so - called ' packing peanuts ' into carbon , which can then be added to the types of lithium batteries used in everyday gadgets			2
during tests the packing peanut - based batteries could store 15 per cent more power than current technology - and they even outperformed similar batteries made of graphite			0
during tests the packing peanut - based batteries could store around 15 % more power than current technology this breakthrough was made by dr @entity33 , dr @entity34 and their colleagues at @entity37			2
they presented their findings at the @entity40 of the @entity41 ( @entity41 )			0
the researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600 ° @entity44 ) to create blocks of black carbon			1
these blocks were then flattened into microsheets and nanoparticles , which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries			2
these sheets had a lithium - ion storage capacity of 420 mah per gram			0
by comparison , an @entity57 battery has a total storage capacity of @entity60 and weighs 0.9oz ( 28 grams ) , while the theoretical capacity of graphite is 372 mah / g. this means the packing peanut technology could make batteries smaller and lighter , yet more powerful			0
typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as @entity70 ( 4,100 ° f ) , meaning dr @entity33 's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly			1
dr @entity33 got the idea to turn these peanuts into nanoparticles and microsheets when he was taking delivery of new equipment for his lab. ' i looked at the packing peanuts and thought that while we are exploring " green " technologies , we should not be harming the environment by throwing them away , ' he said			1

the researchers at @entity37 began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600 ° @entity44 ) to create blocks of black carbon			1
these blocks were then flattened into microsheets ( pictured ) and nanoparticles , which in turn were added as anodes to lithium batteries @entity122 and @entity34 then tested the microsheets and nanoparticles as anodes in rechargeable lithium ion batteries			2
the lithium ions move between the electrodes during charging and discharging and the researchers said their anode works so well ' it outperforms commercial [ anodes ] , with a storage capacity higher than graphite , a typical anode material			0
' and although the higher temperatures used to create other sheets create a more layered arrangement of carbon atoms to maximise performance , dr @entity33 's less - ordered materials are said to have a 15 per cent higher electrical storage capacity			1
typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as @entity70 ( 4,100 ° f ) , which creates more structured sheets			0
by comparison , the ' disordered crystal structure ' of @entity37 's sheets ( shown ) lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit - making them more powerful dr @entity33 hopes his group 's new , scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries ( pictured ) within two years ' [ the batteries ] have disordered , porous structures , ' said dr @entity34			1
' the disordered crystal structure lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit , and their porous microstructure lets the lithium ions quickly diffuse into the microsheets and creates more surface area for electrochemical interactions			0
' dr @entity33 hopes his group 's new , scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries within two years .			0

the discovery was made by dr @entity33 and at @entity37
packing peanuts are the small foam pieces used in packaging
dr @entity33 's team baked the peanuts at 600 ° @entity44 ) to create carbon blocks
these blocks were flattened to make microsheets and nanoparticles
such sheets and particles can then be added as anodes in lithium batteries
