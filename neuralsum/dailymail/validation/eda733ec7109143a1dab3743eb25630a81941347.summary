if you were wondering what the prototype of a @entity3 player is you need not do so any longer			2
the versatile winger - turned - wing - back , who netted the winner in @entity11 's 1 - 0 victory at @entity11 on wednesday , is the @entity13 's kind of guy			1
' he is a player who wants to perform what you say , ' @entity15 told @entity18			0
' i think he fits good in my profile			1
' @entity6 celebrates his goal against @entity11 , and he is a favourite of manager @entity3 young sprints towards the @entity24 support at @entity25 after scoring in the 89th minute manager @entity15 has been frequently picking @entity6 , and @entity11 have lost just once with him in the side so there you have it			1
not @entity30 , not @entity31 , not even Â£ 60million man @entity32			0
the news may not go down well with legions of @entity11 fans who have spent the best part of a season doing their best @entity40 impressions and trying to decipher @entity15 's fabled philosophy			1
that @entity6 , who has often flattered to deceive , is a cornerstone of @entity15 's style may puzzle even further			1
the statistics , however , tell a different story			0
aside from defeat in their home opener against @entity49 , @entity11 have not lost with @entity6 in the side			1
at @entity25 , albeit from a chance laid on a plate , he scored @entity11 's late winner for all three points in the 17 matches he has been involved in since they have won 11 and drawn six			1
at @entity25 , albeit from a chance laid on a plate by the generous hosts , he scored @entity11 's first late winner since @entity60 2012			2
under @entity15 , @entity6 appears to have recreated himself			2
his form at both wing - back and in his traditional slot further up the field is expected to win him a new contract and the @entity13 heaped further praise on the former @entity68 man			2
' we have played also with wing - backs and i think that is his best position , ' said @entity15			0
' now i use him as a winger and he does a very good job			0
i am pleased with him			0
' this season has seen @entity6 as a regular at @entity78 , playing both on the wing and at wing back personality-wise , @entity6 is also a good fit for @entity15			1
he is known as one of the most down - to - earth players at the club and in 2013 responded to an appeal on behalf of a terminally ill @entity11 fan to fulfil his wish of seeing his beloved @entity88 for the final time by handing over his box at @entity78			0
such gestures are not lost on @entity15 , who regularly encourages his men to engage with fans			0
meanwhile , @entity94 is considering entering a not guilty plea after the @entity96 charged him with spitting at @entity11 's @entity97 , who has already accepted the same charge			1
the @entity100 man maintains that he spat at the floor , not at @entity97 , and the club are set to give him their backing			0
he has until 6pm to respond to the charge			0
@entity6 prepares to fire in a shot against @entity106 last weekend as @entity11 chased a top four place			2

manager @entity3 says @entity6 ' fits good in my profile '
his personality and hard - working *nature* are appealing for @entity15
the former @entity68 winger scored the winner against @entity11
@entity24 have lost only once this season when playing @entity6
@entity94 is considering entering a not guilty plea for his @entity96 charge
