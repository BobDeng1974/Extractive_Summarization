tensions between @entity1 and @entity2 have intensified after two @entity1 warplanes were allegedly spotted flying over @entity2 territory			1
@entity2 scrambled its own fighter jets in response , claiming the @entity1 @entity8 planes had entered its air space off the northern tip of @entity12 island in the @entity13			1
@entity1 denied any border violation , but @entity2 defense minister @entity15 said that @entity16 will deal with yesterday 's incident ' strictly , within the bounds of international law			1
' @entity2 released a picture of one of the @entity1 jets it claims made the incursion			1
too close for comfort : this photo taken by the @entity2 @entity27 apparently shows a @entity1 fighter jet @entity29 flying over the sea off the @entity2 island of @entity12 tension : some fear @entity1 , under president @entity34 ( left ) may be trying to test @entity2 's new prime minister , @entity35 ( right ) , who has a reputation as a staunch nationalist rally : silent prayers were offered during a national meeting in @entity16 - attended by mr @entity35 - to demand the return of what @entity2 calls the @entity43 , seized by @entity1 in the closing days of @entity44 disputed : the remote @entity45 are at the centre of a battle between @entity48 and @entity2 mr @entity15 accused the @entity1 fighter jets of intruding into @entity2 air space , heightening regional tensions as @entity52 denied @entity16 's claims that @entity55 naval vessels had locked their weapons - targeting radar on to a @entity2 destroyer last month			1
the alleged intrusion , which lasted just over a minute , happened when @entity2 was observing ' @entity60 , ' when it holds annual rallies urging @entity1 to return a series of islands off eastern @entity12 captured at the end of @entity44 the islands , called the @entity43 in @entity1 , are 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) southeast of where the incident took place			1
in @entity52 meanwhile , @entity55 's @entity69 issued a statement denying @entity2 claims that @entity55 naval vessels had locked their radar on to a @entity2 destroyer and helicopter in two instances last month in the @entity76			2
calls : mr @entity35 delivers his speech during the annual rally which calls for the return of all four @entity1 - held islands @entity82 in northern @entity2 , in @entity16 support : some 2,000 people inclucing former residents of the @entity43 attended the meeting the countries are embroiled in a territorial spat over a cluster over tiny , uninhabited islands - called @entity90 in @entity2 and @entity90 in @entity55 - in the vicinity that are controlled by @entity2 but also claimed by @entity55 and @entity92			1
' the @entity2 so - called claims that the @entity55 navy locked on to @entity2 ships and aircraft with fire control radar are not factual , ' the @entity55 statement said			2
it also accused @entity2 of repeatedly fabricating reports to smear @entity55 over the normal training actions of its military and building @entity55 up into an international threat			0
' the @entity55 side wishes that the @entity2 side take practical actions , cease creating a tense atmosphere in the @entity76 , and refrain from issuing irresponsible statements , ' it said			0
@entity2 foreign minister @entity111 rejected @entity52 's denial as ' completely unacceptable			0
' he told reporters that a thorough review of data by the @entity69 confirmed that the @entity55 naval ship had locked on with its weapons targeting radar			0
protest : another supporter holds a placard reading ' @entity45 ours forever ' as tensions over the disputed territory rises the @entity124 has said that @entity55 ships have in the past switched on their fire control radar as a response to being hailed by @entity130 ships			0
experts say this underlines the need for better communication and coordination between navies			0
the verbal back - and - forth comes amid the rise of @entity55 and to a lesser extent @entity1 's re-emergence as a major power in @entity142 - but it does not point to an imminent military conflict , said @entity144 , a security expert at the @entity145 in @entity16			1
' that 's been encouraging them to be more assertive and more active both on the diplomatic front and military front in this region , ' he said			0
@entity55 and @entity1 may also be trying to test @entity2 's new prime minister , @entity35 , who has a reputation as a staunch nationalist and came to office late last year pledging to defend @entity2 's sovereignty and to get tough with its neighbours in territorial disputes			2
' in the short run , this is happening i think partly in reaction to mr @entity35 's return to office , ' mr @entity144 said			0
while a conflict between @entity2 and @entity1 is much less likely than with @entity55 , @entity1 's alleged flight intrusion may be trying to send a signal to @entity16 not to take them lightly , he said			1
that the incident took place on a day when @entity2 was demanding the return of @entity1 - controlled islands seems intentional , he added			1
@entity1 ' military operations and diplomatic intentions are pretty well coordinated , ' he said			0
photos of the @entity1 jets provided by @entity2 's military indicate that @entity2 fighters got relatively close			2
when a @entity2 fighter aircraft scrambles towards foreign aircraft , it usually maintains a 2,000 feet distance to avoid possible collisions , mr @entity144 said			2
in 2001 , a @entity55 fighter collided with a @entity183 flying about 60 miles from the southern @entity55 island of @entity185			0
the @entity55 jet crashed , killing the pilot , and the @entity130 plane was forced to make an emergency landing on @entity185 , where the 24 crew members were detained and interrogated by @entity55 authorities .			0

@entity2 scrambles warplanes after ' @entity1 intrusion over its territory '
comes as rallies in @entity2 call for return of disputed islands from @entity1
