' @entity2 last month pressed @entity4 in a diplomatic note to let it launch direct flights to the islands			2
three decades after the @entity35 , the promise of oil reserves is inflaming tensions between @entity4 and @entity2 while also boosting the economic hopes of the islanders - estimated to number just 3,140			1

the islands ' oil reserves , which have remained untapped until now but which analysts predict could be worth tens of billions of dollars , have been a major source of tension between the countries since their discovery in 1998			1
