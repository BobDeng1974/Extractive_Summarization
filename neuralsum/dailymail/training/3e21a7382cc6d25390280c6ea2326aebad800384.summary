the floating school will not be a totally alien sight to residents - people living in the fishing community of @entity19 have built their homes on the water and have traded on it for years			2

future : with global sea levels rising and flooding becoming more common in many parts of the world , architects are now looking at new ways to construct buildings , such as the @entity8 novel : the @entity8 is an ambitious project that is currently under construction in the water community of @entity12 in @entity19 , @entity13 the triangular building is being put together by @entity38 , a collaborative agency whose mission is to provide architectural change for developing cities			1
the three - story architectural structure , built as a triangular prism , is intended to float on water with a base made of 256 plastic drums			0
built with locally sourced wood and electrically powered with solar panels , the floating construct is designed to house about 100 students and even has a playground and green space			1
empowering : architect @entity54 of @entity38 said that using floating devices meant they were not relying on the total strength of the soil which is normally an issue for builders in the local area the triangular building is being put together by @entity38 , a collaborative agency whose mission is to provide architectural change for developing cities solution : the idea of building on stilts and raising houses is a traditional approach used in many low - lying areas where flooding is frequently a problem @entity13 - born , @entity74 - based architect , @entity54 of @entity38 told @entity75 that the use of floating devices meant they were not relying on the total strength of the soil , as the soil around @entity12 is particularly loose			1
he spoke of the adaptability of the design , as the water level changes frequently in the area so they ' wanted a design that would adapt to the changing conditions			0
' mr @entity54 hopes his design will pioneer sustainable development in coastal @entity88 cities and his floating town design will eventually replace the entire @entity12 shanties			2
according to the progress report issued by the architects , the school will be completed by the end of the month , with the floating houses being finished in september of this year and the @entity97 project by the end of 2014			0
labour of love : built with locally sourced wood and electrically powered with solar panels , the floating construct is designed to house about 100 students and even has a playground and green space innovative : the three - story architectural structure , built as a triangular prism , is intended to float on water with a base made of 256 plastic drums ambitious : the pilot project will generate a viable , ecological and alternative building system and urban culture for the teeming population of @entity88 's costal regions way of life : the floating school will not be a totally alien sight to residents - people living in the fishing community of @entity19 have built their homes on the water and have traded on it for years @entity128 : mr @entity54 hopes his design will pioneer sustainable development in coastal @entity88 cities versatile : mr @entity54 spoke of the adaptability of the design , as the water level changes frequently in the area so they ' wanted a design that would adapt to the changing conditions ' playtime : children dance on on a floating platform in the middle of their neighbourhood			1
