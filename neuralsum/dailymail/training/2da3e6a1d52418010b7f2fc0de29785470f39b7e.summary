these stunning images of the cave - one of the world 's most dramatic free fall pits and a natural wonder than attracts thousands of cavers each year - show the moment he and his fellow divers plunge into the cave , passing through the clouds inside			2
he set up equipment on the cave floor below to capture the remarkable images			2
' i started caving when i was 21 , as part of a university outdoors club - i 'd already been backpacking and rock climbing with them , ' he explained			0
' a couple of girls i was interested in were going caving , so i signed up and never looked back			0
i 've since traveled all over the world , enjoying some of the most beautiful natural sights on the planet			2
' it 's such a different world it sometimes seems like being on another planet			0

' by far the best way to get into caving is to hook up with a club or grotto as they are called in the @entity87			0
take a beginner 's oriented trip			0
also many show caves now offer wild or adventure tours that can give non-cavers a taste of it			2
