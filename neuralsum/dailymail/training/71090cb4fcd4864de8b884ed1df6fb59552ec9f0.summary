by @entity0 published : 16:49 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 04:10 est , 8 november 2012 dr @entity1 , @entity2 , has emerged as favourite to become the new archbishop of @entity5 a former oil industry executive who opposes same sex marriage and the appointment of gay bishops emerged yesterday as the favoured candidate to take over as the archbishop of @entity5			1
the bishop of @entity13 , the right reverend @entity1 , will be announced as the successor to dr @entity15 in the next 48 hours , sources at @entity17 said			1
the confirmation that the 56 - year - old is the choice to take over as head of the established @entity22 comes after months of tortured deliberations and less than a year after dr @entity1 took up his first appointment as a bishop			1
the long delay - dr @entity1 has been widely named as the leading contender for the job for the past three months - has led to charges that the leadership of the @entity32 is hopelessly divided			1
it has even exposed the @entity22 to mockery from bookmakers who stopped taking bets over the appointment , saying they were worried that clerics are trying to stage a betting coup			2
an old @entity40 , whose mother was private secretary to @entity42 , dr @entity1 is thought to have been preferred because of the managerial skills developed during his career as an oil industry executive before he joined the @entity22			1
the new archbishop will bring an experienced eye to back the @entity22 ’s criticisms of unethical practice in banking and in industry , and he is also thought to be likely to be more sympathetic to @entity54 ’s modernising @entity53 instincts than the instinctively left wing dr @entity15			1
he is considered an opponent of same sex marriage and the appointment of gay bishops			2
but he is likely to be much less abrasive in his opposition to the gay rights movement than his defeated opponent for the archbishop ’s post , the one - time favourite , the archbishop of york , the right reverend @entity67			2
dr @entity67 is thought to have lost ground because of his conservative thinking on some social issues , although he is in agreement with the @entity32 ’s liberal establishment in his criticisms of the excesses of capitalism			2
his ability to command public attention may also have failed to endear him to some @entity32 insiders who prefer a more straight - laced brand of leadership			0
the new archbishop will move into @entity81 after dr @entity15 becomes master of @entity83 in @entity84 , where he spent many years as an academic , in december			1
the new archbishop will replace dr @entity15 who is to become master of @entity83 in @entity84 dr @entity1 , whose mother and father were divorced when he was two , has himself been happily married for more than 30 years			1
he has three daughters and two sons			0
his own father was sent to @entity92 in 1929 after his family lost their money and went on to make his own living as a bootlegger at the end of the @entity100 era			0
archbishop of @entity102 , @entity67 , was favourite for the post but is thought to have lost ground due to some of his conservative views on social issues the father , @entity108 , is also said at one stage to have dated actress @entity110			0
the relationship is said to have ended after her family decided he was ‘ a rotten piece of work ’			0
dr @entity1 went to @entity116 and @entity117 , @entity84 , and then to a high - flying career as a financial director in the oil business			1
he was treasurer of exploration company @entity121 in 1987 when he quit industry for the @entity22			0
he became rector of a church in @entity125 in @entity126 in 1995 , joined the staff of @entity128 in 2002 , and was made @entity129 , leading the city ’s @entity32 cathedral , in 2007			0
he was consecrated as @entity2 - number five in the hierarchy of @entity32 bishops - at the end of october last year			0
while he has little experience running a diocese he has spent years dealing with ordinary parishioners as a local priest - something missing from his predecessor ’s job qualifications			0
dr @entity15 has been known in the @entity22 as a theologian and intellectual			1
by contrast dr @entity1 ’s published writing has been mainly about the ethics of finance and management			1
dr @entity1 appears to have made few enemies during his @entity22 career and is not identified with any one of its warring factions			1
this could help him as he tries to steer the @entity22 through its troubles over gay rights			0
dr @entity15 , who was considered a supporter by the gay rights lobby , lost the backing of some fellow liberals for good after he blocked the appointment of gay rights champion dr @entity162 as a bishop soon after he arrived at @entity81			1
dr @entity15 announced his decision to resign in the last week of march this year			1
the new archbishop will move into @entity81 , pictured , replacing current incumbent dr @entity15 ( addressing the media in the picture ) the 16 members of @entity169 , the committee that recommends a successor to the prime minister , were appointed in april under the leadership of former @entity53 minister @entity173			1
their failure to agree a name at a meeting in september led to speculation over division , over the development of an anyone - but - @entity67 faction , and the lack of enthusiastic support for dr @entity1			2
however , dr @entity1 has been consistently spoken of as the likely successor through the autumn			1
further delay would mean the @entity22 would go into a meeting of its @entity188 , the @entity190 , in 10 days ’ time , without a figurehead beyond december			0
the authority of a new archbishop would provide a boost for @entity32 hopes of at last passing its law allowing women to become bishops			0
bookmakers last night mocked the @entity22 because of the risk of a betting coup over the new archbishop			0
major chains suspended betting after a flood of money backing dr @entity1			2
the price on the @entity2 dropped in a day from seven to four to odds on one to two			0
@entity207 of @entity208 said : ‘ heavens above , if it does turn out to be @entity1 we wo n’t be “ holy ” surprised but will be left wondering whether anything is sacred , as this race always seems to end with a betting coup			2
‘ in the space of less than an hour we had to cut the odds three times , so took the decision to close the book as we know a decision is already overdue and it seems word may have leaked out			0
’ @entity223 of @entity224 said : ‘ punters were backing @entity1 like defeat was out of the question			2
the money we ’ve seen suggests an announcement is only moments away			0
' perhaps people thought we ’d be too preoccupied with events in @entity92 to spot a gamble on the next archbishop of @entity5			0

sources at @entity17 say that the right reverend @entity1 will be announced as successor to dr @entity15 in the next 48 hours
the choice comes after months of tortured deliberations and less than a year after dr @entity1 took up his first appointment as bishop in @entity13
