to put into perspective how young @entity2 is , he was just 18 months old when @entity4 captain @entity3 , to whom he has been compared , made his first - team debut			1
the 17 - year - old midfielder is now the second youngest goalscorer for @entity4 following his strike against @entity8 and he started playing football at an early age , too , when he was around three or four			1
he has been at the club ’s academy since he was six and he grew up an @entity14 fan ( not that that should unduly perturb any on the @entity16 , seeing as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 were all boys in blue before starring at @entity22 )			2
@entity2 was 17 and 183 days when he netted against @entity8			2
he captained archbishop @entity43 to @entity46 victory in 2011 and a year later made his debut for @entity4 ’s under 18 side in a 4 - 3 defeat by @entity50 - on his 15th birthday			1
but it was his performance in the 4 - 1 victory over @entity55 in the @entity56 in 2013 the really caught the eye and prompted @entity17 to tweet that he is ‘ potentially the next @entity3 ’			0
that is high praise indeed and he captained the @entity61 in 2012 - 13 when he was just 16 before moving on to the @entity48 21s last season , for whom he played 19 times			0
he won @entity64 in may after being named on the first - team bench twice , against @entity66 and @entity67			0
he signed his first professional contract in march and impressed in a brief pre-season appearance at @entity32 he has represented @entity70 at under 17 level after captaining the @entity72 in the @entity74 victory over @entity75 in 2012			1
off the field , he enjoys @entity77 , dance music and tv series including @entity80 and @entity81			2
he has now looking to make his big breakthrough			0
captaining @entity70 under 16s against @entity75 in the @entity74 in 2012			0
