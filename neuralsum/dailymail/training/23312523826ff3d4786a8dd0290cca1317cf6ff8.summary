this month is the tenth anniversary of the @entity13 led invasion of @entity5 and the volatile region still remains a dangerous place to live - this morning five people were killed in a blast at a busy market			1

the invasion of @entity5 led by @entity13 troops , in coalition with the @entity78 and other nations , began on 20 march 2003 on the basis of preventing @entity34 's regime from using the weapons of mass destruction it supposedly possessed			1
but when no such weapons were found , the justification was changed to merely removing a volatile and deadly regime			0

the last @entity13 troops left @entity5 by the end of 2011			2
coalition troops may have withdrawn , but the country remains a turbulent place to live as as @entity5 's precarious sectarian balance comes under growing strain			1
only this morning two blasts at a busy cattle market in a mainly @entity111 city in southern @entity5 killed at least five people and injured dozens more , police and medics said			0
no one claimed responsibility for the attacks immediately , but @entity155 insurgents have been redoubling their efforts to undermine the @entity111 - led government and spark deeper intercommunal fighting since the start of the year			0

" i came to buy some calves and was checking them when the explosion happened , i threw myself on the ground , then the second explosion happened , " @entity191 , a butcher at the scene told @entity193			0
friday 's blasts followed a series of explosions targeting @entity111 neighborhoods of @entity38 late on thursday in which at least 22 people were killed @entity5 is calmer than in the communal bloodletting of 2006 - 2007 , but there are concerns the war in neighbouring @entity208 , where mainly @entity210 rebels are fighting to oust president @entity211 , an ally of @entity212 , is pushing @entity5 back towards sectarian strife			0
