the @entity0 has upheld @entity2 's ban on using race as a factor in college admissions in a ruling this morning			1
the justices said in a 6 - 2 decision that @entity2 voters had the right to change their state constitution in 2006 to prohibit public colleges and universities from taking account of race in admissions decisions			1
the justices said that a lower federal court was wrong to set aside the change as discriminatory			2
justice @entity19 said voters chose to eliminate racial preferences , presumably because such a system could give rise to race - based resentment			2
ruling from the highest court : the @entity0 knocked down a case that came from the @entity2 circuit court asking for the ban on affirmative action considerations to be added back into the college admissions process @entity19 said nothing in the @entity31 or the court 's prior cases gives judges the authority to undermine the election results			1
' this case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved			2
it is about who may resolve it , ' @entity19 said			0
in dissent , justice @entity43 said the decision tramples on the rights of minorities , even though the amendment was adopted democratically			0
' but without checks , democratically approved legislation can oppress minority groups , ' said @entity43 , who read her dissent aloud in the courtroom tuesday			0
justice @entity54 sided with @entity43 in dissent			0
at 58 pages , @entity43 's dissent was longer than the combined length of the four opinions in support of the outcome			0
chief justice @entity63 and justices @entity62 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 agreed with @entity19			2
dissent : justice @entity43 wrote a lengthy 58 - page dissent against the ruling , warning that laws that remain unchecked could lead to oppressing minorities justice @entity73 did not take part in the case , presumably because she worked on it at an earlier stage while serving in the @entity78			1
in 2003 , the @entity0 upheld the consideration of race among many factors in college admissions in a case from @entity2			1
three years later , affirmative action opponents persuaded @entity2 voters to change the state constitution to outlaw any consideration of race			1
the 6th @entity90 @entity89 said the issue was not affirmative action , but the way in which its opponents went about trying to bar it			0
in its 8 - 7 decision , the appeals court said the provision ran afoul of the @entity99 of the @entity90 @entity31 's 14th amendment because it presents an extraordinary burden to affirmative action supporters who would have to mount their own long , expensive campaign to repeal the constitutional provision			0
support : justice @entity19 , long considered the swing vote on the nine - person bench , said voters chose to eliminate racial preferences , presumably because such a system could give rise to race - based resentment similar voter - approved initiatives banning affirmative action in education are in place in @entity119 and @entity118			1
a few other states have adopted laws or issued executive orders to bar race - conscious admissions policies			1
@entity126 and @entity127 enrollment at the @entity128 has dropped since the ban took effect			0
at @entity119 's top public universities , african - americans are a smaller share of incoming freshmen , while @entity127 enrollment is up slightly , but far below the state 's growth in the percentage of @entity127 high school graduates			0
the case was the court 's second involving affirmative action in as many years			0
in june , the justices ordered lower courts to take another look at the @entity148 admissions plan in a ruling that could make it harder for public colleges to justify any use of race in admissions			1
the case is @entity155 v. @entity156 to defend @entity157 , 12 - 682 .			2

@entity2 banned the use of race in college admissions in 2006 but a recent case tried to change that ruling
@entity0 ruled that the ban would remain in place with a 6 - 2 vote
normally all nine of the justices vote but @entity73 sat out because she *previously* worked on the case when she was at the @entity78
