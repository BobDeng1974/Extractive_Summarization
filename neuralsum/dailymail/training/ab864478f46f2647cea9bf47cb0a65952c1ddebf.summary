the deadly ebola virus is more likely to claim the lives of those aged 45 or older , scientists have claimed			2
a new study carried out in @entity5 - one of the @entity7 nations worst hit during the outbreak - has produced the most complete picture to date of how the virus affects sufferers			2
from its discovery in the north eastern region of @entity15 in 1976 , the deadly virus has proved hard to track			2
until the death of a two - year - old in @entity19 in december last year sparked the largest outbreak in @entity22 's history , there had been just 1,500 deaths during 25 outbreaks spanning 37 years			1
as a result , and in comparison to other deadly viruses , relatively little data on the virus existed			2
a new study carried out by health workers and scientists at @entity5 's @entity33 , has found the fatality rate for those aged 45 or older is 94 per cent forty - seven doctors and nurses collated the information while caring for 106 patients at @entity33 , pictured , in @entity5 - one of the nations hardest hit by the @entity22 outbreak health workers working with the bodies of @entity22 victims at @entity46 in @entity5 a volunteer medical team carry the body of a victim during the burial of seven people who died from @entity22 in @entity52 the team 's work found the younger a patient is the more likely they are to survive , fever is the most common symptom when victims first seek care , and early medical help is crucial			1
pictured , health workers carry the body of a victim in @entity5 's capital , @entity64 the team tasked with discovering @entity22 in 1976 , led by professor @entity66 , took detailed notes of their findings			1
but in the @entity71 nations plagued by the virus there commonly lacked a standardised procedure for taking medical notes			0
what scientists know often came from informal doctors ' notes , charting incomplete recollections of the virus ' effect on patients			0
no medical records or charts were in place to note patients ' symptoms , vital signs and treatment			0
the team 's work found the younger a patient is the more likely they are to survive , fever is the most common symptom when victims first seek care , and early medical help is crucial			0
the fatality rate for patients under 21 was 57 per cent , while for those aged 45 and older , mortality soared to 94 per cent			1
one striking finding was how devastating the severe diarrhoea , a symptom of the disease , is for patients			0
the report , published in the @entity105 , estimated the incubation period of the patients they examined was six to 12 days - similar to that seen during the outbreak			1
fever was the most common symptom reported by patients with 80 per cent suffering a raised temperature , the study found the higher the temperature recorded on admission to hospital , the more likely patients were to die from @entity22			1
eighty per cent of patients suffered a headache , 66 per cent noted weakness , 60 per cent suffered dizziness , 51 per cent diarrhoea , 40 per cent abdominal pain and 34 per cent suffered vomiting			1
only one patient was found to suffer internal bleeding - one of the most deadly symptoms			0
there was no way of recording accurate death rates			0
but at the @entity33 in @entity5 for the last 10 years , a team of @entity133 scientists has been working with staff and the country 's health department to establish a new medical records system			1
it was introduced to help patients suffering @entity141 fever , @entity138 reports			0
but when the @entity22 outbreak reached @entity5 's third largest city in may this year , the system in place began to collate the most comprehensive set of data ever collected on the virus			1
the findings , published this week in the @entity105 , have added to knowledge of the disease			0
according to the @entity153 , the virus has so far claimed almost 5,000 lives			0
in @entity5 there have been 5,235 confirmed , probable and suspected cases of the disease , of 13,703 across the world , while 1,500 people have died			1
forty - seven doctors and nurses collated the information while caring for 106 patients at @entity33 in @entity5 - one of the nations hardest hit by the @entity22 outbreak			1
seven of the health workers conducting the research died - six from @entity22 , while one suffered a stroke			1
among them was dr sheik @entity169 , the doctor hailed a hero by his government having led @entity5 's fight against the virus until his death in july			2

dr @entity194 , an infectious diseases specialist at @entity196 in the @entity133 , said the findings highlight the advantage of youth			0
the fatality rate for patients under 21 was 57 per cent , while for those aged 45 and older , mortality soared to 94 per cent			1
dr @entity194 said : ' they 're more resilient and younger and tougher			0
' this is definitely the most detailed analysis of symptoms and factors related to survival , ' he added			0
one striking finding was how devastating the severe diarrhoea , a symptom of the disease , is for patients			0
' if you can keep up with simple hydration during that phase , you can prevent a lot of deaths , ' dr. @entity214 , chief of infectious diseases at @entity216 , @entity217 , told @entity223			0
basic supportive health care , providing intravenous fluids and nutrients , and maintaining a patient 's blood pressure can be the difference between life and death			0
of the 213 people initially tested for signs of haemorrhagic fever , around half - 106 patients - were diagnosed with the disease			2
an @entity22 checkpoint in @entity5 , where @entity238 is providing handwashing facilities and electronic thermometers			2
individuals are stopped , have their temperature taken and if they are older than 38 and have signs of a fever they are taken to a holding centre for diagnosis the report , published in the @entity105 , estimated the incubation period of the patients they examined was six to 12 days - similar to that seen during the outbreak the report , published in the @entity105 , estimated the incubation period of the patients they examined was six to 12 days - similar to that seen during the outbreak			1
the @entity153 advises the incubation period can range from two to 21 days			2
fever was the most common symptom reported by patients with 80 per cent suffering a raised temperature , the study found the higher the temperature recorded on admission to hospital the more likely patients were to die from @entity22			1
eighty per cent of patients suffered a headache , 66 per cent noted weakness , 60 per cent suffered dizziness , 51 per cent diarrhoea , 40 per cent abdominal pain and 34 per cent suffered vomiting			2
only one patient was found to suffer internal bleeding - one of the most deadly symptoms - but researchers said some other cases may have been missed as a result of incomplete record - keeping			0
the study found patients suffering weakness , dizziness and diarrhoea were more likely to die .			1

*47* health workers at @entity33 in @entity5 conducted comprehensive study of @entity22 patients
seven of the team died during study - six from the virus
they found age is a key factor establishing the fatality rate for over *45s* is 94 **%** while for those aged up to 21 is 57 **%**
study is significant because it adds new knowledge of the virus
from @entity22 's discovery in 1976 there were just 25 outbreaks in 37 years , *killing* around 1,500 people
as a result in comparison to other viruses relatively little *reliable* data existed for scientists trying to understand the disease
study found incubation period was six to 12 days and if those patients who suffered weakness , dizziness and diarrhoea were more likely to die
