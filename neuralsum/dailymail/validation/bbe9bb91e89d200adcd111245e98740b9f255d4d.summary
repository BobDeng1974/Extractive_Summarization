@entity2 drivers would have the cheapest petrol in western @entity4 if tax was not added by the @entity6 , official figures reveal			1
pre-tax petrol prices in the @entity2 are lower than anywhere in the @entity9 except @entity10 , but when fuel duty and vat are added the cost at the pump is among the highest			1
with just weeks until the @entity16 , the revelation will pile pressure for fuel duty cuts on chancellor @entity19 who has called on fuel companies to reduce charges in the wake of falling global oil prices			1
official data released by the government shows that the pre-tax costs of petrol in the @entity2 has fallen to just 32.4p per litre , the second lowest in all of the @entity9 tax adds another 76p per litre , making it the fifth highest behind the @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 total petrol prices have begun rising in recent weeks , after falling dramatically from £ 1.30 to £ 1.06 in the year to february			1
ministers including mr @entity19 and his @entity38 deputy @entity37 have repeatedly said the price on forecourts must fall to reflect the cheaper wholesale costs for fuel firms			0
but official data released by the government shows that the pre-tax costs of petrol has fallen to just 32.4p per litre , the second lowest in all of the @entity9			2
but tax adds another 76p per litre , making it the fifth highest behind the @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
it means tax makes up 70 per cent of the total price of a litre of fuel , the joint highest with the @entity31			1
by contrast , tax accounts for only 51 per cent in @entity53 and 57 per cent in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
professor @entity58 , director of the @entity59 , said : ' these numbers tell a revealing story			0
for all the chancellor 's calls on oil companies to cut the cost of petrol and diesel the person who has the biggest influence over pump prices is mr @entity19 himself			2
' despite recent freezes in fuel duty , more than two - thirds of what we pay on the forecourts goes to the @entity6			2
' we agree with the chancellor that the cost of fuel is a big burden for the nation 's 37 million motorists but if he really wants to ease that burden then he could do so overnight by reducing fuel tax			0
' the revelation will pile pressure on chancellor @entity19 who has called on fuel companies to reduce charges in the wake of falling global oil prices @entity93 , founder of the @entity94 , said : ' for decades the highest fuel duty in @entity4 has held back the beneficial affects of having the lowest pre tax pump prices			1
' since 2011 , @entity94 has prevented £ 30bn of tax hikes that @entity98 had planned if they had been in @entity99			0
' our haversack of empirical evidence endorsed by @entity6 shows that cutting duty will increase gdp , generate new jobs and lower inflation			0
' it 's no coincidence that five years of frozen duty and recent historic falls in oil prices have given rise to @entity2 's blossoming economy			0
' it 's time that all parties recognise that lower pump prices are good for the hard pressed 32m motorists and businesses by generating other positive growth taxes through lower fuel duty levies			2
it 's about motivating consumers not stifling the with crippling but essential costs			0
' @entity94 continues to call for a 3p duty cut in the @entity16 so the @entity2 drops down @entity4 's league table of this punitive tax			1
' the @entity6 insisted that since 2011 , the government has scrapped the fuel duty escalator that would have increased fuel duty by 1 penny per litre above inflation every year			2
ministers claim that pump prices will be 18p per litre lower by the end of the parliament , compared to the @entity98 government 's fuel duty plans			1
a @entity6 spokesman said : ' we have frozen fuel duty for the remainder of this parliament , resulting in the longest duty freeze in over 20 years			0
' due to the government 's action on fuel duty since 2011 , by the end of the parliament pump prices will be nearly 18 pence per litre lower than they would have been under previous fuel duty plans			1
' this represents a saving of £ 10 for the typical motorist each time they fill up their tank			0

*exclusive* : pre-tax petrol is 32.4p per litre in the @entity2 , only @entity10 lower
but after vat and fuel duty is added , @entity2 average price rises to £ 1.08
makes the pump price in the @entity2 fifth highest in all of @entity9
only drivers in @entity34 , @entity33 , @entity32 and @entity31 pay more for petrol
motoring groups call on @entity19 to *announce* cut in @entity16
