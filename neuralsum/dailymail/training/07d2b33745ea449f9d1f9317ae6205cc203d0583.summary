in a long email sent on monday last week , @entity7 told her @entity11 colleagues auditing is ' for people who truly do n't have any other options '			1
the message , titled @entity15 and queen bey all day ! singled out individual employees for criticism and ended with a rant about how @entity19 trumps @entity20			1
but as the letter , and quantity of hashtags continued , the auditor criticized her colleagues for faking an interest in a job that involves ' filling out useless workpapers that wo n't really benefit anybody '			1
' after asking dozens upon dozens of auditors what they think of their jobs and getting responses that include " i love my job ! " or " i would n't trade it for the world , " i realized just how fake auditors can be , ' @entity7 wrote			2
in the letter that she wrote from her bed , she went on to offer some pointers to her colleagues , including ' get a real career that has meaning ' , and calling for an end to coach and partner meetings that she described , in a series of hashtags as : ' # thatishissoawkward # icantdeal # soforced @entity55 '			1

in an interview with @entity59 she said : ' i 'm not going to sit here and worry about potential negative effects in my life			2
' in her letter , the young professional who had a background in finance , including two internships , hit back at those who arrived early and stayed late when partners were in town , and treated them like royalty			1
' the reality is , they 're not ! they are average @entity77 's like you and i , only their pockets are a little bigger , ' she said			0
the email then became more personal , as @entity56 singled out colleagues for individual criticism , berating them for going on about how stressed they are , talking about their home lives and giving glory ' the side eye '			2
the first team member , whose name was redacted from copies of the email that quickly went viral , was singled out for ' constantly trying to throw me under the bus '			0
' everyday we suffer from hearing this ish as well as listening to your countless stories about your girlfriend , ' @entity7 wrote			0
' you 're such a gossiper that sometimes i think you 're more feminine then you appear			0
who does that ? you 're a grown man , get your life ! ' for good measure she threw in a handful of hashtags for the male employee , including : ' @entity109 ' and ' # someoneneedstheirvagwaxed @entity110 '			0
] @entity112 grind : the @entity114 offices of @entity11			1
the day - to - day reality of being an auditor at one of their offices sparked a spectacular resignation email from glory another coworker was berated for giving her the ' side eye ' , with glory writing to her : ' i think those eyeballs need some readjusting			2
girl , stop ! ' with the last colleague to come in for criticism , @entity56 wrote : ' where do i start ? you hate yourself and your job , let 's be honest			0
' she added : ' your cat does n't care about you so stop caring about it			0

' the rant ended with a list of ten reasons why @entity19 is a better performer than @entity20 , before signing off with : ' beyonce wins and now that i 'm i 'm out of here , i win too ! ! ! # doingtheharlemshakeasitype '			1
since writing the letter , @entity56 said she has had some positive responses from people thanking her for ' giving them a voice '			2
but the email also attracted negative and , in some cases , racist responses as commentators accused @entity56 of being a ' diversity hire '			0
' i was definitely very shocked by how many racist people there still are , ' she said , adding that claims she had been a ' diversity hire ' were absurd			0
