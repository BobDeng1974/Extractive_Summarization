as she stepped out of her car onto the driveway , @entity0 felt her throat prickle with the warning signs of an allergic reaction			0
' i started to flush bright red , and within a few minutes i felt like my throat was closing up and i was struggling to breathe , ' recalls @entity0 , 28			0
' angry red weals began to appear on my arms and neck , and i started to panic			0
' she was suffering anaphylactic shock - a severe and life - threatening allergic reaction causing swelling of the throat and mouth , problems breathing and a dangerous drop in blood pressure			0
essential accessory : @entity0 , 28 , suffers from an allergy to latex that is so severe , she must wear a mask in public places to ensure she does n't have a reaction luckily her mother was with her , and called 999 as well as injecting her with an @entity28 - a device containing adrenaline to counter the allergic reaction			1
' but even after the injection , my blood pressure dropped so low that i passed out in the ambulance , ' says @entity0			0
' my body was shutting down and only providing blood to my vital organs , such as my heart and lungs			0
@entity42 thought that she was going to lose me			0
' @entity0 is one of an estimated 600,000 people in @entity44 with an allergy to latex - a natural substance obtained from rubber trees			1
it is used to make around 40,000 products , including car tyres , airbags , some medical gloves , condoms , balloons , paints and even tarmac - which can make it very difficult to avoid			1
@entity0 's attack was triggered by roadworks in her street : ' a telephone company had dug up the pavement without any notice and laid fresh tarmac			0
particles of latex in the tarmac had become airborne and i 'd inhaled them			1
' allergies are caused by the immune system over-reacting to a normally harmless substance , in the mistaken belief that it is a foreign invader			1
this triggers the immune system to release the compound histamine , which causes symptoms such as itching and swelling			1
one of @entity0 's 27 anaphylactic shocks was triggered by the roadworks in her street in extreme cases , allergic reactions can send the body into anaphylactic shock			1
although most people with a latex allergy will have only an itchy skin rash reaction ( known as a type 4 reaction ) , repeated exposure can make the allergy far worse , and in some cases it can progress to the most serious type of reaction - type 1			1
symptoms start immediately after exposure and include hives , hayfever - type problems , wheezing and , in some cases , anaphylaxis			1
worryingly , you can have a full - blown anaphylactic reaction without ever having experienced any symptoms previously			1
@entity0 's trip to hospital was just the latest of 27 emergency admissions she 's had in the past 18 months - testament to how hard it is to avoid latex in everyday life			1
one attack occurred in a restaurant after @entity0 had been drinking champagne			0
she later discovered that latex was used as a binding agent in champagne corks ( ' it helps preserve the champagne , apparently ' )			2
' i even had one attack in a hospital foyer as a breast cancer charity was handing out latex balloons , ' says the marketing manager , who lives with her parents and son @entity122 , five , in @entity123 , @entity124			2
' now , if i go to a supermarket or shopping centre , i wear a particle filtration mask over my nose and mouth - like the ones people wore in @entity131 at the height of the bird flu scare - just in case there is airborne latex from food prepared or packed by workers wearing latex gloves			2
' it 's the only way i can guarantee my safety in public places			0
' latex allergy became a health problem in @entity44 and globally in the @entity145 when medical workers started to wear latex gloves to prevent cross infection with the hiv / aids virus			1
as well as being made of latex , the gloves used then contained powders that propelled the latex particles into the air , making them more easily inhaled			2
although most @entity158 trusts now use latex - free medical products , there are still large numbers of the population who remain sensitised to latex , says dr @entity164 , consultant immunologist at @entity165			1
' we are seeing fewer new cases of latex allergy in the @entity44 thanks to healthcare workers using latex - free gloves , but the problem certainly has n't disappeared			1
' ' i 've turned my home into a latex - free zone - it 's the only place i feel totally safe			2
' one of the biggest threats comes from a seemingly innocuous item - party balloons			0
' a major problem is the hazard of latex balloons used for promotional activities in shopping centres and restaurants , ' adds dr @entity164 , who is chairman of the @entity186 's medical advisory panel			2
' most stretchy , rubbery balloons contain latex ; foil balloons do not			2
' and when paints and tarmac are freshly applied or stripped off , particles of latex can become airborne , so that it is another potential source of allergens			2
' people just do n't realise how dangerous a latex allergy can be			1
even some medical staff confuse type 1 and type 4 allergies and tend to think latex allergy causes nothing more serious than an itchy rash - not realising that it could kill someone			1
' and those with latex allergies do n't need even to come into close contact with the substance says @entity211 , chair of the @entity186			1
' just being in the same room as latex gloves can be enough to trigger an attack , ' she warns			2
' some surgeons still prefer to wear latex gloves , and hospitals allow balloons on the premises , so there 's no room for complacency			2
' many latex allergy sufferers also develop a cross-reactivity to some fruits and vegetables , as they contain similar proteins , adds @entity227 , professor emeritus of allergy at @entity230 , @entity231 , and a medical adviser to the @entity233			1
' the body mistakes proteins in certain fruits and vegetables for the proteins in latex and mounts an allergic response , ' says the professor			2
' the main triggers are bananas , avocados , kiwis and chestnuts , but others can cause problems , too			0
' latex allergies became a problem in @entity44 when medical workers in the @entity145 started wearing latex gloves to prevent cross infection with the hiv / aids virus @entity0 started suffering itchy red rashes at 16 after using latex gloves in science lessons at school			1
' at university , i studied biochemistry so often worked in a laboratory			0
it was difficult to avoid exposure to latex gloves and other equipment , such as latex caps on bottles			1
at 21 , the allergy worsened and i had to give up my career in biochemistry			0
' @entity269 , 47 , a former bank worker who lives in @entity270 with her husband @entity271 and four children , had to take medical retirement because her employer could not guarantee her a safe work environment			0
' everything from elastic bands to hair lacquer in the toilets set me off , ' she says			0
' even my trade union unwittingly triggered an attack by sending me a squeezy stress ball which contained latex			0
' i 've turned my home into a latex - free zone - it 's the only place i feel totally safe			0
' @entity269 is convinced she became sensitised to latex as a child living close to factories that made tyres and condoms in @entity231 's @entity291			0
' once , i even had an attack when a car braked sharply and burnt the rubber on its tyres in front of me			0
' i do n't want to sound like a killjoy , but latex balloons could be fatal if i encountered them in a confined space			0
it 's a constant battle to persuade businesses to take this risk seriously			0
' people do n't realise that a latex allergy can be deadly and that latex is found everywhere			1

over half a million @entity44 have an allergy to latex
the substance , used to make around 40,000 products , is difficult to avoid
symptoms include hives , wheezing and , in some cases , anaphylaxis
