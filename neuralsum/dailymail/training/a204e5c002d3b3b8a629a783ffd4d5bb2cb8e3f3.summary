by @entity0 published : 19:20 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 19:22 est , 8 august 2013 @entity2 mp @entity1 said the @entity2 were ' haemorrhaging ' membership because @entity4 and his ' remote clique ' at @entity6 were not listening to ordinary people 's views the @entity2 last night point blank refused to reveal how many members it has amid claims the total may have plummeted below 100,000			1
@entity2 mp @entity1 said the party was ‘ haemorrhaging ’ membership because @entity4 and his ‘ remote clique ’ at @entity6 were not listening to the views of ordinary people			1
meanwhile @entity19 has seen membership soar to as many as 40,000 as the party captures the attention of former @entity23 with its anti-eu rhetoric			2
@entity2 central office said it never commented on its membership figures , prompting critics to claim the silence must mean they are ‘ horrific ’			1
former @entity2 donor @entity29 tweeted : ‘ we still have not received the membership numbers for the @entity2			1
' sadly i suspect it ’s really bad			0
’ @entity34 and the @entity35 both publish membership figures			2
although both have seen numbers fall , the @entity34 figure of 187,537 is still far higher than the rumoured @entity2 total			1
a @entity34 source said : ‘ @entity2 chairman @entity42 is repeatedly refusing to answer straightforward questions about their membership			1
‘ while we have a healthy membership gearing up to knock on doors at the next election , the @entity23 ’ silence indicates they will face real problems			1
’ membership going down the pan , @entity54 ? @entity2 central office said it never commented on its membership figures , prompting critics to claim the silence must mean they are ' horrific ' although they will not reveal membership figures , the @entity23 ’ accounts do say how much money is raised from membership fees , which suggest that numbers have fallen			1
in 2012 , the total amount raised in fees was £ 747,000 – down 28 per cent from the £ 1,031,000 two years earlier			0
meanwhile , some @entity2 associations have revealed their membership figures , many of which were very low			1
for example , marginal @entity71 and @entity72 in the @entity73 has only 79 members			0
such tiny levels of support make it very difficult to raise money for local campaigns or get enough people to knock on doors during elections			0
mr @entity1 – whose @entity85 constituency has seen membership soar 60 per cent since the election – said some associations existed only on paper because there were so few supporters willing to pay up			1
former @entity2 donor @entity29 tweeted : ' we still have not received the membership numbers for the @entity2			2
sadly i suspect it 's really bad ' he told the @entity100 ’s @entity99 programme : ‘ we ’re still doing politics like it ’s the 1950s and we wonder why we ’re haemorrhaging membership			2
‘ it matters enormously if political parties shrivel because if they exist only on paper , as i ’m afraid in many conservative associations is now the case , what you end up with is a remote clique in @entity6 who run the party as private property with a few local franchises , and people feel disengaged			0
’ mr @entity1 said people did not want to join up because party members no longer had any power , unlike in the 1970s and 1980s when they could vote on policies at annual conferences			1
he continued : ‘ it ’s a little bit like those banks that do n’t want to reveal what ’s on their balance sheet because there ’s some bad news lurking there			0
‘ i suspect it is going to be horrific			0
i suspect it is going to be lower than 100,000 but if we fess up to if we can start to fix it			0
’ meanwhile @entity134 , from the conservative home activists website , said he believed membership was between 100,000 and 130,000			2
writing on @entity136 , he said : ‘ @entity137 wants trade union members to be able to opt into @entity34 membership			2
‘ there are roughly six million members of trade unions in the @entity145			0
were even a paltry five per cent of them to join @entity34 as individual members , its membership could climb to three times that of the conservatives			0
‘ there is no time like the present for @entity4 to face up to the fact that the party is dying on its feet , and act to revive it			0
’ @entity2 central office says it is impossible to provide a figure because the information is largely held by local associations who hold the overwhelming majority of memberships locally			2
they say a comprehensive picture is difficult to ascertain due to the fact that most local associations provide their figures only when it comes to a leadership ballot , the last of which was held in 2005 when mr @entity4 was elected			0
membership was then around 260,000			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ @entity174 does not comment on its membership figures			1

@entity2 last night refused to reveal how many members it has
there are claims the total may have plummeted below 100,000
@entity2 mp @entity1 said the party was ‘ haemorrhaging ’ membership
