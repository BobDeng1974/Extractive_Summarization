@entity0 will be 30 on @entity1 and should be able to celebrate his landmark birthday as @entity5 's @entity4 captain			1
after a ' hell of a year ' , though , he will be taking nothing for granted as the selectors consider - as they have promised - all aspects of @entity5 's 5 - 2 defeat in @entity11 as part of their scheduled series review , before announcing a 16 - man tri-series squad on saturday			1
@entity0 conceded after the margin of his fifth successive one - day international series defeat was confirmed on tuesday as 5 - 2 , by an 87 - run trouncing at @entity19 's @entity18 , that he has no ' divine right ' to be selected to lead the team to the @entity4 in @entity22 and @entity23 early next year			1
@entity0 has endured a horrible series as @entity5 captain this winter in @entity11 he can be encouraged , however , by @entity5 managing director @entity26 's strong hint that - despite his ' miserable ' run of form - he is highly likely to retain the gig			1
for @entity0 , it is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity - because however @entity5 fare down under , with or without him , it is hard to envisage him being back for much more with his sheet - anchor skills in a fast - developing format			1
@entity26 also described 2014 as a ' traumatic ' 12 months as he reflected on his tenure - which began at the start of january , as @entity5 were completing their unexpected whitewash @entity39 defeat			2
one crisis after another followed , the messy aftermath of the @entity39 including the sacking of @entity45 and resignation of coach @entity47			0
as @entity0 and @entity47 's replacement , the returning @entity50 , tried to forge a ' new era ' , the captain especially endured the most taxing of summers as calls for his resignation started to wane only once @entity5 turned round their @entity57 fortunes en route to a 3 - 1 win over @entity60			1
after @entity62 's century had helped to inflict @entity5 's final defeat of 2014 , @entity0 said : ' it 's been a hell of a year			1
@entity0 has consistently failed with the bat at the top of the order in one - day internationals ' we have n't won a lot of games , and there 's been a big change in personnel			1
' it 's certainly been a year of transition - from 15 months ago , when we were winning the ashes at home , to what 's happened			0
' it 's been a year you would n't expect , but @entity5 have found some outstanding cricketers as well			2
' among them , perhaps most prominent are @entity85 and @entity86 - the latter palpably unlucky to be omitted from @entity5 's @entity88 in @entity11 and , even now , a plausible outsider to make the final 15 for that @entity4			1
others , such as pace - bowling pair @entity91 and @entity93 , have made late surges for central roles at the global tournament - while @entity97 alone excelled himself amid the inconsistency elsewhere from the tourists			0
asked to identify where @entity5 struggled most , @entity0 said : ' one of the hardest things was taking wickets up front - so @entity11 , most of the time , had a good base to get going from			1
' the one game we did take early wickets , we won			0
' also , batting at the right rate without losing wickets			0
' we were scoring at a good rate , but we were n't good enough to do it and keep wickets in hand			0
' @entity5 are still searching for that successful @entity88 formula , with the bat especially , which others seem to have hit upon first			2
@entity116 celebrates as @entity11 enacted a humiliating series win against @entity5 many key figures within the game have called on @entity5 to call time on @entity0 's captaincy scoring at a winning tempo , without a damaging risk factor , is a balance they find difficult to strike			1
@entity0 , however , is not above learning from others and adapting to effect improvement			2
' the way @entity129 [ @entity130 ] and @entity62 played in particular , they 've obviously taken the right options - good enough to hit the boundaries , and stay in			0
' we 've been hitting the boundaries , and not staying in			0
' as for his own continued lack of productivity at the top of the order - 119 runs in six innings at an average of 19.83 and strike rate of 67.23 - he knows much , much better is required			2
he said : ' there 's not many players who 've been at the top of the game for long periods and have n't had tough moments			0
' there 's no one , i do n't think ... maybe @entity153 is one			0
' everyone has really tough moments , as a batter particularly , because it 's a hard game			0
' you 're playing against the best players in the world , week in week out , at the top of the order			2
' it 's very easy sitting watching ... it 's harder walking out and doing it			0

@entity5 lost against @entity11 in the odi series this winter
@entity0 has consistently failed with the bat at the top of the order
but he looks set to keep hold of the captaincy before the @entity4
