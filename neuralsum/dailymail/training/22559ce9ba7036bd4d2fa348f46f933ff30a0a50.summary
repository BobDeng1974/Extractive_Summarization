by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 12:45 est , 6 january 2014 the @entity2 in @entity3 will provide incredible displays of physical skill - but the most impressive performance wo n’t come from the likes of @entity8 or @entity9			1
it will instead be delivered by a paralysed teenager , who , during the opening ceremony in june , will kick a ball using a robotic body suit controlled by his or her brain			1
the exoskeleton , which has been designed as part of the international ' @entity19 ' , will use motorised metal braces to support and bend the teenager ’s legs			1
the teenager will wear an exoskeleton , artists ' illustration pictured , that will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected the suit itself will be controlled by patterns of brain activity detected by electrodes placed either on the scalp or within the brain itself			1
these signals will be sent wirelessly to a computer worn by the wearer , converting them into movement			1
the team behind the suit is a collaboration between various universities including @entity52 in the @entity53 , the @entity54 and the @entity55 among others			0
it plans to incorporate sensors into the exoskeleton that feed information about touch , temperature and force back to the wearer			1
the feedback is expected to come through a visual display or a vibrating motor			0
‘ the vibrations can replicate the sensation of touching the ground , rolling off the toe and kicking off again , ’ @entity68 , at the @entity54 , @entity67 said in an interview with the @entity70			0
the body suit is the result of research from the @entity79 lab that looked into hair - thin and flexible sensors , known as microwires , implanted into the brains of rats and monkeys			2
these wires were used during tests to simultaneously control movements of both arms of a virtual monkey avatar , pictured the exoskeleton , which has been designed as part of the international ' @entity19 ' , will use motorised metal braces to support and bend the teenager ’s legs			1

the teenager - who is yet to be selected from a group of 10 hopefuls - will undergo training in a virtual reality simulator to translate thoughts into signals to the robotic armour			2

‘ we want to galvanise people ’s imaginations , ’ @entity130 , the @entity3 neuroscientist at @entity52 added to the @entity131			1
‘ with enough political will and investment , we could make wheelchairs obsolete			0
’ the body suit is the result of research from the @entity79 lab that looked into hair - thin and flexible sensors , known as microwires , implanted into the brains of rats and monkeys			0
these flexible electrical prongs can detect minute electrical signals generated by hundreds of individual neurons in the animals ’ frontal and parietal cortices - the regions that control a vast brain circuit that is responsible for voluntary movements			0
in 2000 , @entity156 ’ lab reported that a monkey had been able to use power of thought to control a robot arm using these sensors			0
more recently , his lab has shown that monkeys can control the movement of both arms on an avatar using just their brain activity			1
to enable the monkeys to control two virtual arms , researchers recorded nearly 500 neurons from multiple areas in both cerebral hemispheres of the animals ’ brains , the largest number of neurons recorded and reported to date			0
video : @entity130 at @entity179 several human quadriplegics have also received implanted brain chips in clinical trials			0
for instance , @entity183 , who was paralysed after being stabbed in the spine , learned to raise , lower and drop after objects after electrodes were implanted in his brain			2
professor @entity79 is now developing a new kind of electrode that branches like a tree into a vast network covering a larger volume of the brain			0
he hopes this network will help make deliver more complex exoskeletons that can control a greater number of limbs using the power of thought .			0

the kick will take place during the opening ceremony in @entity205 , @entity3
@entity207 will use motorised metal braces to bend the teenager ’s legs
its movement will be controlled by brain activity detected by electrodes
sensors will feed information about touch and force back to the wearer
