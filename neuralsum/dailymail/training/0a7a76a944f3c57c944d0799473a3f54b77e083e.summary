@entity0 has backed @entity1 to make a return to football , insisting : ‘ he 's not a rapist he 's not a paedophile			1
he 's made a mistake and it should n't end his football career			2
' @entity9 revealed this week that @entity1 had exchanged a series of racist , sexist and homophobic text messages with @entity12 while they were at the @entity14 club			1
but @entity0 believes the scot should be given the chance to redeem himself			0
what they did is not right but @entity1 is a great fella , a family man , a football man but he 's made mistakes			1
‘ suddenly everybody 's an angel			0
it should n't finish his life he 's a top manager and i feel really sorry for him			0
‘ i 'm not condoning what he 's done but he 's not a bad person , he 's a fantastic lad			0

he 's made a mistake and it should n't end his football career			2
‘ i 'm lucky i do n’t send text messages but i do get silly message with sick jokes on them from time to time			1
’ @entity1 was set to be named as the new @entity49 manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the @entity53			2
@entity12 , meanwhile , resigned from his position as @entity49 ’s sporting director			1
on thursday , the @entity56 issued a poorly - worded statement on behalf of @entity1 - before a backlash forced them into a humbling apology			1
the original statement read : ‘ in the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff , it emerged that @entity68 had , it seems , sent a couple of one - line texts that were , with the benefit of hindsight , very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures			1
error : @entity0 ( left ) accepts @entity1 made a mistake but that his career should not be over ‘ these were two text messages sent in private at a time @entity68 felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter			1
’ but less than 24 hours later , a second statement was released : ' the @entity56 apologises for some of its wording , in its release yesterday , which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist , sexist or homophobic nature			1
that was certainly not our intention			0
the @entity56 apologises for some of its wording , in its release yesterday , which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist , sexist or homophobic nature			1
that was certainly not our intention			0
' it is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory , even used in private , are totally unacceptable			0
the @entity56 remains absolutely aware of our responsibility to the game and to promote and uphold the highest standards of behaviour			0
' the @entity56 will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to @entity1 whilst the @entity53 conducts its investigation , other than to repeat that both the @entity56 and @entity68 will be cooperating fully			2
' we will continue to work with all of the game 's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms			0
