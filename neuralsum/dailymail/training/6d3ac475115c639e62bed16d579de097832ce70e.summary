@entity1 captain @entity0 insists @entity2 will be fresh and raring to go when the 40th @entity3 gets under way at @entity5 on friday , but hinted that @entity6 may not be alongside him when it does			1
@entity2 and @entity6 have been regular partners in team events since 2009 , winning three of their four matches in the @entity13 and also representing @entity14 in the @entity15 that year and 2011			1
the @entity17 duo have also played six times together in the @entity3 , including the very first match at @entity20 two years ago , and would seemingly make an obvious pairing at @entity5			1
@entity0 insists @entity2 will be raring to go when the 40th @entity3 gets under way @entity2 's ongoing court case with his former management company put a strain on their relationship as @entity6 was also represented by the same firm , but , with both players insisting that would not be a factor this week , @entity0 revealed other concerns			1
' both of them have assured me all along that there 's no issues and that 's the way i 've always seen it , ' @entity0 told a press conference on monday			1
' whether they come together or not is another story			0
' three or four months ago , i had a very strong view that they would have been , but the more i look at their statistics and the more i look at the different value i have with them , i 'm thinking there may be value in not doing it			0
but the world no 1 may not be paired with fellow @entity17 irishman @entity6 ' if i do n't decide to play them , it would be for tactical reasons			1
they have played six @entity3 matches and they have only won two together ( losing three and halving one )			1
it 's not like these guys are written in stone			2
they are not a formidable fourball pairing that 's unbeatable ( both wins have come in foursomes )			2
' @entity6 was the last member of the @entity1 team to arrive at @entity5 on monday afternoon , while @entity2 turned up on sunday after a week off following the @entity65			1
despite saying he was in need of a rest , the 25 - year - old kept himself busy with various sponsorship and social events , but @entity0 added : ' i do n't have any concern			2
he hit balls yesterday and got a real good break away from golf			0
@entity3 captains @entity0 and @entity76 speak at a press conference ahead of the tournament ' @entity79 does n't always necessarily mean lying in bed for the week or lying by the pool			1
i think getting out and doing different things he 's been doing , having fun , like going to the boxing the other day , and doing that @entity86 ( programme ) too - those are things he enjoys doing			2
' he arrived yesterday afternoon , had a nice session with his coach and again this morning , so he 's fresh , he 's ready			2
' @entity2 was famously not ready for his singles match at @entity20 two years ago , when a time - zone mix - up meant he needed to hitch a ride in a police car to get to the course with just 10 minutes to spare			1
staying on site at @entity5 should ensure there is no repeat this time - ' they can roll out of bed to the first tee in five minutes , ' @entity0 joked - and the @entity1 captain has also learned another important lesson from 2012			1
@entity2 said on sunday that people should expect some different pairings on the @entity1 team on friday video pundits provide insight into potential pairings ' it was a big learning curve for us in a lot of ways , ' the 47 - year - old @entity112 added			1
' sadly for me it was the first time in a team situation that we were really getting a wallop the first two days			2
' i learned a lot from ( captain ) @entity123 - the decisions he made and the structures he put in place to give us the best chance of getting out of the hole that we were in			0
looking back on it now , it was a great experience			0
' the bottom line is , this is a very , very strong @entity134 team			0
the favourites tag is irrelevant as far as i 'm concerned			0
we 're going to have to play really well to win this @entity3			2
' i think we 're slight favourites			0
we 're not overwhelming favourites			0
but we have been favourites before and i think our players have deserved it			0
i think it 's a situation to embrace			0
it 's not something to be afraid of or be ashamed of			0
the guys have worked very hard to be in the position they are			0
' @entity0 revealed that there would be no ban on players using social media during the week , adding : ' the last few @entity149 that i 've been involved in the policy was to be aware of what you 're doing and be aware of confidences to be breached and privacy			1
you have to trust the players at the end of the day			0

@entity0 says world no 1 @entity2 is raring to go
but @entity1 's @entity3 captain says there may be *unusual* pairings
@entity2 normally partners @entity6 but may not this time
@entity1 have won five of the last six @entity149
40th @entity3 will be played at @entity5
