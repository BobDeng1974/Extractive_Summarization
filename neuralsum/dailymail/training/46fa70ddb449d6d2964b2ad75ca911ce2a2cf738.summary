our homes could soon be powered by floating generators that double up as mobile phone masts			1
@entity5 - based @entity4 has teamed up with the @entity6 to power homes across the northwest state using its @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
the @entity9 is a wind generator that sits at altitudes of 1,000ft ( 305m ) - where gusts are stronger and more consistent - and is capable of reducing energy costs by up to 65 per cent			1

@entity4 claims that at these altitudes , winds are between five and eight times stronger than those harvested by tower turbines			2
this equates to a 65 per cent saving on energy costs , and reduces installation time from weeks to days			1
the @entity9 uses a helium - filled , inflatable shell to lift to high altitudes			0
high - strength chains hold the @entity9 steady while also being used to transfer the electricity created back to the ground			0
the @entity9 's lifting technology is adapted from aerostats - industrial cousins of the blimp			0
@entity4 designed the @entity9 to offer ' consistent , low - cost energy for the remote power market , including remote and island communities ; oil and gas , mining , agriculture , and telecommunication firms ; disaster relief organisations ; and military bases			1

the @entity67 project will be the first commercial use of the technology and will be used to test how effective it is , and how much it costs			0

the @entity9 's lifting technology is adapted from aerostats - industrial cousins of the blimp @entity4 claims at high altitudes , winds are between five and eight times stronger than those harvested by tower turbines @entity4 has been developing the technology for the past four years and announced in march 2012 it successfully generated energy from 350ft ( 106m ) with an automated prototype of its airborne wind turbine			1
it lifted a top - selling turbine to produce over twice the power at high altitude than generated at conventional tower height and landed again in an automated cycle			2
the turbine was successfully transported and deployed into the air at @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94 , from a towable docking trailer			0
the @entity9 is designed to have ' virtually no environmental or noise impact ' and requires minimal maintenance			0
the company continued that the @entity4 will displace expensive fuel used to power diesel generators at remote industrial , military , and village sites			1
in the long term , @entity4 plans to scale up the technology to reduce costs in the offshore wind market			1
‘ for decades , wind turbines have required cranes and huge towers to lift a few hundred feet off the ground where winds can be slow and gusty , ’ explained @entity107 , @entity4 ' chief executive officer			2
‘ we are excited to demonstrate that modern inflatable materials can lift wind turbines into more powerful winds almost everywhere - with a platform that is cost competitive and easy to setup from a shipping container			0
’ the company hopes the @entity9 , pictured , will replace expensive fuel used to power diesel generators at remote industrial , military , and village sites the @entity9 is designed to have ' virtually no environmental or noise impact ' and requires minimal maintenance , compared to tower turbines , pictured			2

generator was designed by @entity5 - based @entity4
the @entity6 will use the generator to power homes
it floats at 1,000ft ( 305m ) , where the wind is ' stronger and more consistent '
this reduces energy costs by up to 65 per cent , claim the company
@entity141 said its floating generator also doubles up as a phone mast
