the sun 's magnetic field may be responsible for increasing the number of lightning strikes on @entity5 , a study has claimed			1
research into the @entity8 's weather system found that lightning strikes in the @entity8 increased by up to 50 per cent when our planet 's magnetic field was bent by the sun. and the findings could be used to make reliable forecasts of electrical storms in the future			1
a @entity19 study claims the sun is increasing @entity5 's lightning ( stock image shown )			1
they found that strikes increased when our magnetic field was bent by solar activity			1
this allows more particles to enter the atmosphere and cause lightning ( stock illustration shown ) as it rotates , the sun temporarily ' bends ' the @entity5 's magnetic field allowing a shower of energetic particles to enter the upper atmosphere			1
normally , the @entity5 's magnetic field acts as a force - field stopping it from being bombarded by particles from space , known as galactic cosmic rays			1
these have previously been found to prompt a chain - reaction of events in thunderclouds that trigger lightning bolts			0
but , research by the @entity19 found over a five - year period the @entity8 experienced around 50 per cent more lightning strikes when the @entity5 's magnetic field was skewed by the sun 's own magnetic field			1
previous research from the @entity19 suggested that high - energy particles from the sun , known as the solar wind , creates a ‘ pathway ’ need for lightning ot travel			0
they say that the solar wind – in which the particles are propelled from the sun ’s atmosphere at around a million miles per hour – charges the air , meaning a lesser current is needed for a lightning bolt to strike			0
cosmic rays – another source of charged particles from exploding stars on the other side of the @entity71 – are thought to be another trigger for lightning			0
the results could prove useful for weather forecasters , since solar winds synchronise with the rotation of the sun , sweeping into @entity5 ’s atmosphere at regular intervals			0
dr @entity81 said : ' we 've discovered that the sun 's powerful magnetic field is having a big influence on @entity8 lightning rates			2
' the sun 's magnetic field is like a bar magnet , so as the sun rotates its magnetic field alternately points toward and away from the @entity5 , pulling the @entity5 's own magnetic field one way and then another			1
' the findings could pave the way for an accurate forecasting system to warn of possible electrical storms many weeks in advance			2
to do so , weather forecasters would need to combine conventional forecasts with accurate predictions of the sun 's spiral - shaped magnetic field known as the heliospheric magnetic field ( @entity105 )			2
this field is spewed out as the sun rotates and is dragged through the solar system by the solar wind			0
the study , published in the journal @entity112 , used satellite and @entity115 data to show that between 2001 and 2006 , the @entity8 experienced a 50 per cent increase in thunderstorms when the @entity105 pointed towards the sun and away from @entity5			2
this change of direction can skew or ' bend ' the @entity5 's own magnetic field , which could expose some regions of the upper atmosphere to more galactic cosmic rays - tiny particles from across the universe accelerated to close to the speed of light by exploding stars			1
lightning strikes in the @entity8 ( stock image shown ) were found to increase by 50 % when @entity5 's magnetic field was skewed by the sun. and the findings could allow for accurate predictions of electrical storms the study , published in the journal @entity112 , used satellite and @entity115 data to show that between 2001 and 2006 , the @entity8 experienced a 50 per cent increase in thunderstorms when the sun 's magnetic field pointed towards @entity5 ( bottom ) , as opposed to away from @entity5 ( top ) dr @entity144 added : ' from our results , we propose that galactic cosmic rays are channelled to different locations around the globe , which can trigger lightning in already charged - up thunderclouds			1
' the changes to our magnetic field could also make thunderstorms more likely by acting like an extra battery in the atmospheric electric circuit , helping to further " charge up " clouds			0
' it adds to previous research that found an unexpected link between energetic particles from the sun and lightning rates on @entity5			0
professor @entity165 , head of the @entity166 said : ' this latest finding is an important step forward in our knowledge of how the weather on @entity5 is influenced by what goes on in space			0
' the @entity19 's continuing success in this area shows that new insights follow from atmospheric and space scientists working together			0
' scientists have been reliably predicting the solar magnetic field polarity since the 1970s by watching the surface of the sun. ' we just never knew it had any implications on the weather on @entity5			2
we now plan to combine regular weather forecasts , which predict when and where thunderclouds will form , with solar magnetic field predictions			2
' this means a reliable lightning forecast could now be a genuine possibility			0

@entity19 study says the sun is increasing @entity5 's lightning
they found that strikes increased when our magnetic field was bent by solar activity , allowing more cosmic rays to enter the atmosphere
lightning strikes in the @entity8 were found to increase by 50 % when @entity5 's magnetic field was skewed by the sun
and the findings could allow for accurate predictions of electrical storms
