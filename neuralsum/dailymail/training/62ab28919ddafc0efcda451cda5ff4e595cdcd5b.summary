@entity0 could have been saved following her medical procedure gone wrong if doctors had headed signs the comedian was going into shock , claims new report			1
@entity8 ' doctors ignored her dropping blood pressure and pulse and even failed to call 911 for 10 precious minutes as they attempted to resuscitate her once they realized she was dying , according to @entity12			1
prior to that , insiders , outside experts and the findings of a federal report reveal that drs. @entity18 and @entity19 -- along with an unnamed anesthesiologist -- carried on with their procedure as if nothing was wrong with @entity8			1
drs. @entity18 ( left ) and @entity19 ( right ) were part of a small team of medical care providers that a state report says ' failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention ' in the late @entity0 ' routine procedure gone wrong but something was wrong at @entity31 on august 28 and the trouble started after 9am , when @entity8 was put under with normal vital signs			1
fifteen minutes later , @entity8 started showing signs of shock as her blood pressure dropped to 92/54 and her pulse fell to 56			1
' at this point , something has gone wrong , the procedure must come to an end , and she needs to be resuscitated , ' a veteran paramedic not involved in the case told the @entity45			2
the doctors failed to act when @entity8 ' vital signs dropped even further , reports the @entity45			1
instead , with the 81 - year - old 's blood pressure at 89/44 and her pulse at 54 , the doctors administered propofol -- the powerful anesthetic that led to the death of @entity53			2
' that does n’t make any sense , ' said @entity57 's paramedic			0
' you ’re sedating someone who ’s going into shock			0
' even as she began coding , with her bp at 84/40 , and her pulse at 47 , the examination reportedly continued			0
that was at 9:28am , 12 minutes after @entity8 ' vital signs should have first caused concern			1
still , the examination continued , with just an increase to her oxygen flow			2
' routine ' : rivers , 81 , was put under anesthesia for a routine procedure on august 28 from which she would never wake up the tragedy occurred at @entity31 in @entity76			1
investigators say the doctors who performed the procedure failed to act as @entity8 showed signs her condition was deteriorating two minutes later , the examination was stopped and records show the doctors began trying to resuscitate rivers with life - saving drugs			1
they would n't call 911 for another ten minutes			2
and records indicate they did not administer cpr as they awaited the paramedics			0
by the time they arrived at 9:47 , paramedics found @entity8 ' turning blue form lack of oxygen			2
a state report released early in november said the clinic ' failed to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention			1
' rivers died september 4 of brain damage due to lack of oxygen			1
the federal @entity101 has given @entity31 until january 7 to correct deficiencies to avoid losing @entity104 accreditation			0
the clinic said it has submitted a plan to state and federal accreditation agencies addressing all issues raised			0
it said the physicians involved no longer provide services there			0
also among the series of blunders reported by the @entity45 's @entity57 , was that staff at the @entity76 clinic failed to weigh @entity0 before sedating her with @entity118			1
heartbroken @entity119 , 46 , ( seen left with @entity0 at a red carpet event and right with her son more recently during a shopping trip after her mothers ' death ) will file a multimillion - dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against @entity128 and is working with top firm @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 & @entity135 @entity119 is preparing to launch legal action against @entity137			0
she will not just include the clinic in her legal action - but her mother 's personal @entity141 doctor @entity19 as well			2
a source told @entity144 : ' @entity119 is undaunted , she 's going after the clinic and the doctors personally involved			2
these doctors will rue the day they went near @entity0			0
' heartbroken @entity119 , 46 , will file a multimillion - dollar medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against @entity128 and is working with top firm @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 & @entity135			0
in a statement , attorneys @entity134 and @entity135 said : ' our client , @entity119 , is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the @entity158 report			0
' as any of us would be , ms. @entity0 is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before , during and after the procedure			0
moving forward , ms. @entity0 will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient			0

reports and insider accounts reveal doctors at the @entity76 clinic where the comedian died ignored signs that @entity8 was in trouble
drs. @entity18 and @entity19 continued their *endoscopy* procedure even as @entity8 ' vital signs dropped *dangerously*
the doctors eventually attempted to resuscitate @entity8 but did not call 911 until their efforts fell short
rivers , who was 81 , died days later on september 4 of brain damage due to lack of oxygen
