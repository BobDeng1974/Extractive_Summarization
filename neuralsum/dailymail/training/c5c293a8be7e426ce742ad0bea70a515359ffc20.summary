former @entity1 presenter @entity0 has broken her silence about why she quit her role hosting the respected current affairs show saying she needed a new challenge , but fears she may struggle to land a ' dream ' role because of her distinctive @entity9 accent			1
@entity10 also told @entity11 rumours she left the show because of cuts announced to the @entity14 and @entity1 were untrue , but said : ' i might be doing them a favour by leaving '			1
the 40 - year - old enjoyed a successful six - year stint at @entity20 in @entity21 but the lure of working in her homeland proved too much in early 2013 and she signed with @entity1 to host @entity1			1
but now , almost two years later , she believes another challenge beckons			0
' i am up for any broadcaster , commercial or public , ' she told @entity11 , while admitting there may be a problem with that plan			1
' i am not going to deny that there have been issues surrounding my accent and i can not say that i have experienced this at any time , anywhere in any country other than since moving to this country and this is my country , so it 's been a little difficult , ' she said			2
' i went to boarding school in the @entity9 which is what did this to my accent but people say to me " when can you get back on tv because it 's so distinctive we automatically know it 's you , if we are not even watching or preparing the dinner or whatever , we know it 's you " and i think that is a really valuable thing			1
' it means a huge amount to me as well because i am very proud of my accent			0
i would hope that it is not an obstacle also given my experience in this industry			0
' one would hope that a silly little thing like my accent is not going to stand in the way of great things			0
' i moved here for new opportunities and those are the sorts of things i want to now investigate			0
' i love this country , i am half @entity41 , my mother is from @entity89 and my passport is @entity41 , it always has been , despite my accent			1
' i am committed to staying here and i have a five year old son who lives here , i will be staying here			0
' ' i love this this country , i am half @entity41 , my mother is from @entity89 and my passport is @entity41 ' @entity0 said that ' i had always planned at about this time , i have been incredibly fortunate to have hosted @entity1 for the past two years it has just been an absolute privilege to work with these people ' hard news reporting and once - a - week programs behind her , @entity0 's eyes are now firmly fixed on in - depth interviewing roles			1
' i had always planned ( to resign ) about this time , i have been incredibly fortunate to have hosted @entity1 for the past two years it has just been an absolute privilege to work with these people			1
' for me , i realised that i wanted something more			0
dateline is just once a week and i come from a breaking news background , six years doing breaking news at @entity20 and prior to that breaking news at @entity110 in @entity111			2
so i come from a very high octane environment and i just wanted a bit more of that , i felt like as far as hosting @entity1 was concerned i had done pretty much all that i could do			2
' the spectre of cutbacks did n't help , she admitted			0
' i ca n't deny that when you see the writing on the wall with something like this , it certainly hurried things up in my mind			0
' more than that , it just cemented what i was feeling was the right thing to do , that was to step down and you know if budget cuts are part of it then i might be doing them a favour by quitting			1
' @entity10 says of the imminent cutbacks at the public broadcaster that she feels sad for ' those wonderful people who are now going to be on the job - hunt i guess but they are such good journalists that i have absolutely no doubt they will go onto fabulous things ' she leaves with a heavy heart , aware her colleagues face an uncertain future			1
' i was always very sad of just myself leaving because i thought i wo n't get to see these fantastic people as often any more			1
that already made me sad but now with the sort of snowball - effect of what has happened , of course , i do feel a bit gutted			2
' i do feel particularly sad for those wonderful people who are now going to be on the job - hunt i guess but they are such good journalists that i have absolutely no doubt they will go onto fabulous things			2
' she is proud at what the show achieved with her in the hot seat			0
' the idea that we were actually hitting a quarter of a million in audience figures on a very frequent weekly basis shows there is a significant appetite for what we were serving up , which is incredibly encouraging			0
' then again if management saw something to which we are not privy to , in that the format was not working any more for whatever reason , they are totally within their rights to go ahead and change that format , there is nothing anyone can do , it is the nature of the industry			0
when she once was the face and voice of @entity20			2
@entity0 spent six years at the broadcaster in @entity21 , fronting breakfast and talk shows ' i have had 18 years of hard news but what i was best known for at @entity20 were two shows , my daily prime - time breakfast and also my weekly talk show , " @entity190 " and that is the style of thing of what i would like to get back into			1
' meeting people , famous or otherwise and just finding out about their lives and what makes them who they are			0
anybody who has got a story , that 's essentially what i am into , more like psychological journalism			0
' i 've done enough of the hard news i want to get into the interviewing one - on - one , finding real slice of life stories , that 's absolutely where my passion lies			2
' and as for future television bosses who may need a little more convincing about just how @entity41 she really is , @entity0 concluded by saying ' i do speak fluent @entity208 ' .			1

@entity0 quit as presenter of @entity1 on @entity1 after two years on the job
but the award - winning tv presenter denies her decision was made in *protest* at the *government* 's budget cuts to public broadcasters

hopes that a distinctive @entity9 accent wo n't be held against her
she has *previously* worked for @entity20 and @entity227
she 's @entity21 born and educated at a @entity9 boarding school and her mum hails from @entity89 in central @entity231
