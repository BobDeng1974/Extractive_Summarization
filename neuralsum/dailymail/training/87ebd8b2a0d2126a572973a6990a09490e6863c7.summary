by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity2 may have defeated the @entity3 in this year 's @entity4 , but when it comes to football in @entity8 , it seems that it is the @entity9 that truly reign supreme			1
this according to the 2014 @entity12 @entity11 fandom map , just released by @entity13 , which shows every @entity11 county ’s favorite professional football team , as determined by the @entity12 team that @entity13 users have ‘ liked ’ the most			2
and like all athletic events , this one has a big loser too , with the @entity21 failing to be the most popular team in any county in the country			1
fans : a new map shows the most popular @entity12 team by county according to @entity13 winners : the @entity9 are the most popular team in the country according to @entity13 most of the map is no surprise at all though , with the @entity34 locking up almost every county from @entity36 through @entity37 ; the @entity38 claiming the top spot throughout @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 ; and the @entity3 controlling a large portion of @entity8			1
it is the @entity9 , however , who are by far the biggest team in the country , with large chunks of fans not only in @entity49 , but also @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53			2
the @entity54 have a pretty strong reach too , as the most popular team in @entity57 , as well as northern @entity58			0
no love : the @entity21 failed to claim a majority of fans in any county in the country second rate : more people in @entity66 are fans of the @entity67 rather than the @entity68 on the opposite end of the spectrum , the @entity68 did not manage to get much love at all , with almost every county in their home state backing the @entity67			1
but even the @entity68 managed to lock up southeastern @entity66 and parts of @entity75 , whereas the @entity21 got trounced in @entity76 by @entity78 fans			0
in fact , of the 32 professional teams in the @entity12 , they are the only one who did not manage to secure at least one county			0
seems like that @entity78 - @entity21 rivalry may be a little bit more one - sided than some would like to admit .			0

@entity13 has released a *report* on the most popular teams in @entity8 by county
the @entity9 , @entity3 , and @entity34 all had strong showings
the @entity21 do not have a majority of fans in any county in the country
