@entity30 : the ' @entity31 ' is so - called for its resemblance to apes such as the golden monkey ( file picture ) ' the weird thing was that each one was a little bit different and almost seemed to have their own personalities			2
' there was a happy one , a sad one , one with a little nose , big lips - a whole family			0
