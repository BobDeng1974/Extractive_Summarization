call : justice secretary @entity0 has ordered a review of a controversial court that has the power to make decisions in secret @entity0 has ordered an urgent review of a controversial court that has the power to make life - or - death decisions – and even send people to jail – in secret			1
the justice secretary last night asked one of the country ’s most senior judges to consider steps to increase the transparency of the shadowy @entity18			2
set up in 2007 under @entity21 ’s @entity20 , it gave the state draconian powers to intervene in the lives of those deemed unfit to look after their own affairs			1
@entity28 increased when the @entity29 revealed last month that a woman had been jailed in secret after trying to remove her father from a care home where his family thought he was in danger of dying			1
a judge ruled @entity37 , 50 , should go to prison for five months for contempt of court even though she was not present or represented by a lawyer			1
she is the first person known to have been imprisoned by the @entity18			2
several senior mps expressed alarm at the case and suggested the government should review its procedures			1
now the justice secretary has written to sir @entity47 , @entity48 of the @entity49 , asking him to expand an existing review of the family courts to consider the use of secret hearings in the @entity18			1
‘ we have already agreed there is a need for greater openness in the family courts , with the intention that we make progress on this as soon as possible in order to ensure public confidence			0
’ he wrote in a letter seen by the @entity29			0
‘ as you will be aware , the issue of transparency in the @entity18 has also recently attracted media attention			0
set up in 2007 under @entity69 , the @entity18 gave the state draconian powers to intervene in the lives of those deemed unfit to look after their own affairs ' while we want to ensure that we balance the interests of safeguarding vulnerable adults with those of increasing the transparency of proceedings , i would welcome your views on how we might best achieve this			1
‘ therefore i would like to invite you to consider if you might extend the scope of your work on transparency in the family courts to include arrangements for the @entity18			0
’ ministers are expected to hold a meeting in the next few weeks with sir @entity47 on how the review will proceed			2
concern : @entity28 increased when the @entity29 revealed last month that @entity37 had been jailed in secret after trying trying to remove her father from a care home a @entity97 source said mr @entity0 had been ‘ deeply concerned ’ by the idea of people being jailed in their absence and without any public scrutiny and believed reforms must be considered			1
mp @entity103 , chairman of the all - party @entity104 on @entity106 and the @entity18 , said : ‘ at last the government has stopped being complacent and pretending there is no problem			0
‘ they have been ignoring this issue for years			0
the @entity37 case was one where she was imprisoned for taking her father to a solicitor to get legal advice to prove that the courts were wrong			1
' that ca n’t be right			0
there is a general problem of secrecy right across the family courts			0
if the legal system wo n’t stand up to public scrutiny there is something wrong with the legal system – not with public scrutiny			0
’ former @entity128 care minister @entity128 , who has been critical of the court , welcomed the move			1
‘ i think a review is timely and should allow us to ensure justice is being seen to be done			2
we need to bring this more into the light so people understand how this court does its job			2
‘ it ’s also vital that where decisions are being made that have a very direct and considerable impact on families ’ lives , that every effort is made to ensure that they actually know what is going on			0
’ miss @entity37 was jailed for taking her father @entity147 out of his care home against the instructions of a court order that he should not be moved			1
she served six weeks of her sentence			0
a judge ruled miss @entity37 was causing her father ‘ very considerable grief ’ and ‘ it seems to be only right she should go to prison ’			1
pleased : mp @entity103 , left , is glad that the government has stopped being complacent on the issue , while former @entity128 care minister @entity128 , right , also welcomed the move the @entity18 , which handles 24,540 cases a year of which 2,700 involve the @entity165 , is increasingly being asked to sanction key medical decisions that will either prolong a patient ’s life or allow death to take its course			2
it also intervenes in other business involving property , financial affairs , divorce and other civil disputes when a person is deemed unable to make decisions			0
set up by the last government , the court was given powers to sit in secret			1
in practice , it has never opened to the public and only its final judgments are occasionally made available beyond the courtroom			0
@entity188 , a contempt expert with the law firm @entity190 , said : ‘ this is in every practical way a secret court			1
five months is a long sentence			0
it is rare that a court will sentence someone to five months for contempt			2

the court was set up under @entity21 *'s* @entity20 in 2007
@entity37 was jailed in secret by the court it was revealed
she tried to remove her father from a care home as she *feared* for his life
mps expressed alarm and the case and called for an urgent review
