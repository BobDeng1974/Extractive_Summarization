a @entity1 firm claims it is getting closer to allowing parents to pick the embryo most likely to succeed			1
researcher believe that 50 - 80 % of what determines @entity6 could be inherited			2
now a @entity1 firm is mapping the genes of people who are gifted in maths in a bid to isolate the genes that make them smarter that the average person			1
babies in a @entity1 nursery : researcher believe that 50 - 80 % of what determines @entity6 could be inherited , and are developing tests to screen for those who are good at maths @entity24 - based @entity23 is mapping the genes of math geniuses , and appealing via its web site for more to take part in the controversial study			1
@entity23 , formerly called @entity23 , is the world ’s largest genetic - research center , and already has an initial batch of 2,000 dna samples from high - iq subjects			2
researchers then plan to compare these against a sample from the general population - and hopefully isolate what makes them special			1
in theory , this knowledge could then be used to allow parents to pick ' smart embryos '			1
other divisions of the @entity1 giant already offer genetic testing , leading some to speculate it could eventually launch a screening programme for prospective parents			1
researchers believe most children are within 13 iq points of their parents ’ combined average			1
however , two or three out of every hundred children turns out to be significantly more intelligent , @entity53 , a researcher on the project , told @entity56			0
a graphic from the controversial firm showing how @entity6 can affect life outcomes			2
the slide was shown at a recent talk at @entity62 , where the project was explained			0
” people believe it ’s a controversial topic , especially in the @entity66 , ' @entity67 , head of @entity68 , told the @entity69			0
' that ’s not the case in @entity1			0
' in fact , @entity72 , a state bank that lends to government pet projects , has given bgi $ 1.5 billion , although the firm says it will not turn over its data			2
' imagine what a couple might pay to ensure that they get the best out of 10 or 50 possible offspring , optimizing over their choice of heritable attributes , ” he wrote on his blog , comparing the cost of a @entity88 degree or private school with the few thousand dollars it takes to fertilize and implant embryos			0
' there are going to be countries that say this is part of our national health - care service and everyone is doing it , ” he told the @entity99			0
“ and eventually it would become unstoppable , because the countries that initially outlawed it would have to come around			0
how could they not ? ”			0

@entity24 firm appealing for maths genius to get in touch to be genetically mapped
firm hopes to isolate what makes them gifted
could lead to parents being able to choose the smartest embryo
