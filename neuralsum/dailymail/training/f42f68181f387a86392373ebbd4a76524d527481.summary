she fled the house in her bloodied dress , barefoot because she was too afraid to look around for her shoes			0
she called her three best friends at the time , two guys and a girl , who found her beaten and in shock			0
while her friends were distraught at her condition , they debated calling the police fearing the impact it would have on @entity11 's and their reputation ( the two boys wanted to rush a fraternity )			2

@entity161 told @entity11 she could go to the police with her story , or treat the incident in house by either filing a complaint with the school 's @entity160 , or sit down for an informal resolution ' with her attackers in a meeting mediated by @entity113			1
@entity11 decided on neither option , and despite hearing the terrifying story , @entity161 did not open an investigation into the fraternity			2
@entity11 is now coming forward two years later , because she recently discovered that two other women experienced similar assaults at @entity14			1

@entity11 and her friend @entity203 went to speak with @entity113 in her office , and @entity113 said that she heard it ' through the grapevine ' that ' all the boys involved [ in the gang rape ] had graduated '			1
@entity11 believes that was false since she saw one of her attackers on a campus riding a bike recently			0
