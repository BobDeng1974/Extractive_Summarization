nearly one out of six @entity2 players will declare bankruptcy within 12 years of retiring from the league , a shocking new study has revealed			1

bleak future : despite @entity2 players earning millions - sometimes times of millions - over the course of their careers , nearly 16percent of players are bankrupt within 12 years @entity22 earned a reported $ 64million in salary and endorsement deals - but was bankrupt before he even finished his @entity2 career			1
widely reported rumors say he spent $ 5,000 a week at cheesecake factory though bleak , the 15.7percent figure found by the researchers , is dramatically lower than a widely quoted statistic that 78percent of retired players are bankrupt or under ' financial stress ' within two years of leaving the league			1

defensive tackle @entity46 played 13 seasons in the @entity2 and made more than $ 82million			2
he retired in 2007 and filed for bankruptcy in 2012 - citing several failed business ventures			0

@entity22 also blamed investment advisers who he claimed took advantage of him			0
quarterback @entity57 filed for bankruptcy in 2008 - in the middle of his high - profile career and legal troubles that sent him to prison			1
he was still paying off his $ 18million in debts in 2014 - despite making $ 130million from the @entity2 and millions more from endorsement deals			0
' we 've known that it can be very difficult for the average family to save , ' @entity10 finance professor @entity86 , one of the researchers , told the @entity91			2
' but this is one group that you might think ought to be able to avoid bankruptcy			0
they 're in a position to buy some good advice if they need it			0
but even for them , with all these millions , it 's a challenge			0
