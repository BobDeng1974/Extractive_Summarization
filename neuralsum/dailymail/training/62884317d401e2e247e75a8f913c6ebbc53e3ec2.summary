@entity1 cabinet minister @entity0 has produced this garish @entity4 - style magazine to promote his election chances like all good lifestyle mags , it features family recipes , a crossword and minor celebrities			1
but ' @entity11 ' is a magazine with a difference – it is actually a political campaign leaflet for one of @entity18 's most high - profile @entity16			1

social media users agreed the snap would make the perfect cover for a contemporary easy listening cd album , and the idea sparked dozens of other doctored images entitled ' @entity90 ' – including the politician walking away from an explosion , landing on the moon and joining the @entity95 movie line - up			1
the first copies of @entity11 were put through letterboxes this week , and the @entity1 team is now working on a ' tabloid newspaper ' to be handed out before the @entity100 on may 7			0
mr @entity0 has an 8,765 majority in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , however his share of the vote is expected to collapse			1
a recent poll from lord @entity105 suggests there could be a massive 25.5 per cent swing to the @entity23 , which has chosen @entity109 leader @entity108 as its candidate			0
mr @entity0 has admitted he faces a tough challenge			2
' i do n't really believe the numbers in these local polls but they do reflect a truth , which is that in this constituency , it 's going to be a very close battle , ' he told online news site @entity119			0
' it 's very much a head - to - head contest between myself and the @entity122			0
and i do n't underestimate that i 've got a real fight on my hands			0
' the pamphlet includes ' @entity0 's sausage and butternut squash stew ' and quotes from supporters that he is a ' good sport ' there is also a tongue - in - cheek feature on last year 's internet ' meme ' involving the @entity136 minister , who was photographed strolling on the banks of @entity82 in semi-casual attire there is a sprinkle of celebrity stardust with a picture of former @entity145 host @entity144 , and an interview in which mr @entity0 discusses being called a ' ginger rodent ' by @entity150 's @entity149 in keeping with the magazine theme , there is even a crossword that offers the prize of a bottle of @entity156 in talk of the @entity158 , former @entity1 leader @entity159 – mp for neighbouring @entity161 – adds : ' in government , @entity0 has delivered for our @entity58 communities			1
' there is a sprinkle of celebrity stardust with a picture of former top fear host @entity144 , and an interview in which mr @entity0 discusses being called a ' ginger rodent ' by @entity150 's @entity149			1
and in the interview with the minister 's father , @entity172 reveals he was brought up in ' traditional settings ' , ' prospered ' at school ' and says ' his heart is truly here in the @entity39 '			2

the campaign promises ' extensive advertising , digital and business to business activity launched in key tourism markets featuring the famed @entity211 until 2019 '			0

' @entity0 talks about stew and tablet recipes whilst planning a menu of austerity cuts			1
in more ways than one , people ca n't stomach what he is offering – which is what is really making him the ' talk of the glens '			2
' unlike the @entity1 , the @entity23 have a positive story about our successes in government to tell people in the @entity39 and we will never prop up a @entity249 government - which is why more and more local people are putting their faith in us as we approach the election			0
