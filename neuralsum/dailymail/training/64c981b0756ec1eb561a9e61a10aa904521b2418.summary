no matter how small your house or flat is , chances are there are corners of rooms where you struggle to get a @entity7 signal			2
the eero system has been designed to banish these so - called @entity7 ‘ dead zones ’ by boosting a router ’s signal inside , and outside , a house			1
a square eero box measures 4.75 inches ( 121mm ) , meaning it can be placed discreetly around a house , and it regularly runs checks on the network to avoid crashes and interference			1
the square eero boxes measure 4.75 inches ( 121mm ) and can be placed around the home to create what ’s known as a ‘ mesh network ’ to boost @entity7 signal @entity28 is based in @entity29 and was founded by @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
it creates what ’s known as a mesh network			2
mesh networks are typically used by businesses because they transfer data in ‘ multiple hops ’			0
by comparison , a traditional router and extender only lets data make a single hop			0
width : 4.75 inches ( 121mm ) depth : 4.75 inches ( 121mm ) height : 0.85 inch - 1.26 inch ( 22 - 33mm ) processor : @entity50 dual - core apps : @entity52 , @entity53 and web browser price : individual boxes cost $ 125 ( £ 85 ) , a pack of three eero boxes costs $ 299 ( £ 196 ) release date : summer 2015 by sending data in multiple hops , it minimises how much signal is lost			1
signal is also lost as it travels through walls , and can suffer from interference from home electronics and a neighbour ’s @entity7 , for example			2
‘ @entity28 is the world ’s first @entity7 system , ’ explained the firm			1
‘ [ @entity74 ] work in unison to deliver hyper - fast , super-stable @entity7 to every nook of every room			2
' and from your backyard , too			0
’ it boosts the signal by using multiple paths to transfer data			0
for example , if a door closes or a cordless phone causes interference , eero routes around it by taking an alternate path or by using a different frequency band			2

@entity7 signal degrades as it travels through walls , and it can suffer from interference from home electronics and a neighbour ’s @entity7 , for example			2
a box is pictured on a typical desk it regularly runs checkups on the network and scans for devices that are connected to a network , including the speeds each device is achieving throughout the home , and any interference			1
and from a security point of view , eero alerts users whenever a device joins a network and will send a weekly report of all devices that have used the network			0
a pack of three eero boxes can be pre-ordered for $ 299 ( £ 196 ) , while an individual box costs $ 125 ( £ 85 ) - although @entity119 said a network can contain up to 10 boxes , for larger houses			1
devices are expected to ship this summer , and will initially only be available in the @entity124 and @entity125			1
shipping will add $ 10 ( £ 6 ) to each order			0
the company has not announced when the devices will go on sale in other regions			0

each square eero boxes measures 4.75 inches ( 121mm )
multiple boxes placed around a home create a so - called ' mesh network '
they work in *tandem* to *maintain* and boost @entity7 signals in every room
if signal is *weakened* , eero *automatically* uses a different frequency band
it also runs regular checkups on the network and devices to *monitor* speed
a pack of three eeros costs $ 299 ( £ 196 ) , while a single box costs $ 125 ( £ 85 )
@entity28 will ship in summer and will initially go on sale in the @entity124 and @entity125
the firm has not announced when eero will go on sale in other regions
