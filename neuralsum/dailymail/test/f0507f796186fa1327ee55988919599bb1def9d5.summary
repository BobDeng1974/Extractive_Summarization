scientists in @entity1 have extracted the oldest ever dna sample to be taken from a @entity3			1
calcium formations on ‘ @entity5 ’ - a skeleton found in a cave in 1993 - suggest he was 128,000 to 187,000 years old			1
now researchers plan to sequence his dna to see if they can reveal new details about the evolution of our ancient ancestors			1

researchers have , up until now , held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton			2
an earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a @entity3			2
the current project has been ongoing for six years with researchers taking a tiny part of shoulder bone and analysing it in the lab. it is believed that @entity5 was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck			1
@entity5 is a city of @entity38 , in southern @entity1			1

pictured is ‘ @entity5 's ’ skull from different angles scientists assume he starved to death , or died from lack of water - but not much else is known about his life			1
analysis revealed that the calcite on skull was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago , during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of @entity63 and @entity64			2
the team say samples of dna have also been retrieved from the sample , and because of the age , represent the oldest such samples ever recovered from @entity3 remains			2
it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient @entity3			0
but the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes			0
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning @entity84 now have roughly two per cent @entity3 dna			1
these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history			0
however , some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases			0
scientists have found that part of our @entity99 system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from @entity3			0
other researchers have suggested that humans outside @entity105 are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with @entity3			0
researchers from @entity109 and @entity110 universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the neanderthal genome			0
if they manage to sequence the dna , they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the @entity3			1
separate research earlier this week found that @entity3 suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off			0
they have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis , typhoid , whooping cough , encephalitis and the common cold			0
but anthropologists from @entity136 and @entity137 say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of @entity3			0
neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies			0

@entity5 was discovered in a cave in 1993 in southern @entity1
skeleton 's calcium formations suggest it is 128,000 to 187,000 years old
scientists have *successful* extracted dna and are trying to sequence it
they say @entity151 might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids
