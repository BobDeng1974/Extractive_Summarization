a young woman lies in a pool of blood alongside her newborn baby on the dusty floor of an ebola treatment centre in @entity6			1
the @entity8 unit is where @entity9 believe they go to die , not ' to be born or to live ' , said @entity12 doctor @entity11 , who found the new mother			1
but in a place that 's notorious for death and suffering , dr @entity11 's quick - thinking paid off and both mother and baby have survived			1
and the newborn 's name ? doctor @entity11 , of course			1
he is an infectious diseases trainee at @entity39 in @entity31 , but spent five weeks as an @entity41 volunteer at the @entity8 treatment unit between february 6 and march 15			1
the centre was built by the @entity43 , funded by the @entity12 government , and has so far screened more than 385 patients - 105 of whom tested positive for the virus			1
tragically , just 32 of those recovered			2
dr @entity11 has described in detail the morning of little doctor @entity11 ' birth after a ' fairly brutal ' night shift earlier this month			1
' there had been seven deaths in the day and two more overnight , ' he said			2
' that was my purpose for being in the red zone			0
' confirming death is one of the least enjoyable aspects of a doctor 's responsibility			2
here , confirming death is increasingly harrowing			0
' patients prefer to lie directly on the concrete floor , maybe it is cooler , which then involves continuously washing off not only layers of dust , but dust caked in their own bloody body fluids			0
' mother and baby : @entity71 and her newborn tested negative for @entity29 and were discharged earlier this month dr @entity11 dons his personal protective equipment before entering the high risk area of the @entity77 treatment unit he added : ' they lie , rigor mortis already setting in , in whatever position they happened to be in prior to passing			1
' this particular morning my grim responsibility was thankfully complete			0
shortly after this however , an employed @entity29 survivor came running out of the suspect ward			0
' the eight - month - pregnant lady was no longer pregnant			2
' dressed in personal protective equipment ( @entity89 ) , dr @entity11 re-entered the high - risk zone and found the young woman , @entity71 , on the ground under a blanket			1
concealed under the simple piece of fabric was her newborn baby in an increasing puddle of blood			1
' with my own heart rate rapidly increasing i was blessed by the imminent arrival of a far more competent national nurse carrying a birthing pack , ' he said			0
' with some hastily shouted orders over the fence , i scooped up baby and deposited him on to mum			2
' baby was quiet and a little blue			1
now , i had seen on television that if you give them a rather firm rub they start to shriek ; which he did right on cue			0
' without any prior experience of what i was about to undertake , i clamped the cord , cut it , delivered the placenta , checked it was all intact , gave her some oxytocin and massaged her tummy			0
' lucky : a young woman was found on the ground under a blanket , which concealed this beautiful newborn baby medical staff wait to be disinfected after leaving a high - risk zone at an ebola treatment centre in @entity6 soon the baby was wrapped up , the bleeding stopped and the woman was taken away to be cleaned up			1
' the whole experience actually went just as it should have done , ' dr @entity11 said			1
' just as it has done for millenia , across the world , thousands upon thousands of times			0
' except this , of course , was not like all those other times because unbeknownst to this little bundle of joy , he had arrived into the world in the middle of an @entity29 ward			0
' @entity41 is one of a handful of international non-governmental organisations that is treating @entity29 patients in @entity151			0
it is currently operating four @entity29 treatment centres – two in @entity154 and two in @entity6 – which provide not only isolation and care for @entity29 patients , but also psychosocial support			1
to expand the pool of health workers capable of managing and working in emergency treatment units across the region , @entity41 is providing high - quality training for local staff , other partners and organisations in @entity154 and @entity6			1
@entity29 management training centres have been opened			0
to date , @entity41 has trained more than 620 local and international staff who are now helping combat this outbreak in @entity151			0
in addition , it is working to find ways to strengthen local @entity174 health care capacity			0
' this is where people believe they come to die , not to be born or to live , ' he added			0
' his cord was cut by the double - gloved hand of a nervous @entity12 medic in a suffocating yellow suit			2
' the reality is that mum was a suspected @entity29 patient and if positive , then he was almost certainly positive too			0
' after the ordeal , dr @entity11 joked with the mother that she could call the baby @entity11			1
to his surprise , @entity71 gave her newborn the title of doctor @entity192			1
the centre was built by the @entity43 , funded by the @entity12 government , and has so far screen more than 385 patients - 105 of whom tested positive for the virus			1
tragically , just 32 of those recovered and were discharged hope : the survivor wall at the @entity8 treatment unit			1
each hand print represents a life saved by the medical team subsequently , both mother and baby tested negative for @entity29 and were discharged soon after			1
' having begun his existence in such desperate surroundings you might think that things can only get better , ' mr @entity11 added			1
one of the deadliest viruses known to man , @entity29 is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms			0

the world 's worst @entity29 epidemic has killed more than 10,200 people in total in the three most affected countries of @entity228 , @entity154 and @entity6 since march 2014 when it was first confirmed in the forest region of @entity228			2
ebola cases in @entity6 have dropped sharply from a peak of more than 500 in december to around 50 cases a week , helped by @entity12 military assistance			1
