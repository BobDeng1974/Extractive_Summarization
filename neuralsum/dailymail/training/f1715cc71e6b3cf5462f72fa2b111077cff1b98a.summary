the first police investigation into the death of an elderly hospital patient under the discredited @entity4 has begun , a police force revealed yesterday			1

probe : @entity8 , 85 , died at @entity20 ( pictured ) in june this year the @entity4 was supposed to ensure dignified and pain - free dying but it was scrapped after a scathing independent inquiry last year found it had meant ‘ uncaring , rushed and ignorant ’ treatment of the most vulnerable patients			1
the inquiry headed by @entity26 unearthed ‘ desperate stories of desperate people ’ who had been denied water on hospital wards after they had been assumed to be dying			0
ministers branded the system ‘ a national disgrace ’ and ordered it to be stopped by july 14 , 2014			0
however , medical records released to mrs @entity8 ’s daughter @entity37 show her mother was placed on the pathway in @entity20 on june 26 this year , the same day that health minister @entity40 announced new rules on care for the dying and promised patients that in future ‘ their voices , and those of their families , will be heard at all times ’			1
