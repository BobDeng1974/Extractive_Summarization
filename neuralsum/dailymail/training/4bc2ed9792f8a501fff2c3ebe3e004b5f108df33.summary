rating : everyone thinks @entity1 is a chain			1
all hotels within the group are individually owned and managed - but they operate under the marketing umbrella of @entity1			1
' hotels with personality ' is the group 's current motto			1
but my experience is that they differ enormously			1
the @entity13 : a chain hotel - but one with a bit of a story , and a decent dose of character there are smart ones and not - so - smart ones - and the @entity13 in @entity22 , @entity23 , belongs firmly in the second category			1
it is quite posh from the outside : a former 16th - century coaching inn in a town that comes as something of an elegant , @entity31 surprise			2
@entity32 , @entity33 's mistress , lived here			1
as did @entity34 , who discovered @entity36 's tomb			1
our visit coincides with a coach party from @entity40 staying overnight			2
we are all paying around £ 50 for bed - and - breakfast			2
throw in dinner and it works out at no more than £ 70 for two people			2
our room ( brown carpet and a whiff of cooking ) is normally sold in conjunction with one opposite to create a family annexe			2
so , rather than having an en - suite bathroom , we wander down the passage , and quite like the stroll			0
but something odd is going on with the taps			0
the water comes out of the shower only above the bath			0
there is no lever to direct it directly into the tub			0
and do n't expect a bottle of designer water or much in the way of soaps and potions			0
instead , there is a plastic cup wrapped in cellophane			0
the restaurant is chokka , so we eat by the window next to the bar			0
on ordering drinks , they are handed to us over the counter			0
lazy or relaxed ? we 're not sure			0
no - frills service , for sure			0
but portions are generous , the atmosphere jovial and , if your visit coincides with a saturday , the market in @entity22 is a joy			1
in fact , in 2015 , the market will be celebrating 800 years of trading - and the @entity13 will be looking on with pride			1
@entity89 station street @entity22 @entity23 @entity90 08445 73 73 73 @entity91 doubles from £ 50 b&b rating :			1

the @entity23 *village* of @entity22 has two major *historical* *claims* to fame
it was the home of @entity33 's lover @entity32 , and @entity34
the @entity13 hotel , operated by @entity1 , is one of its key hotels
