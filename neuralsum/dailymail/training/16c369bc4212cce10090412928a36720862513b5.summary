it may look more like a high tech water pistol or something out of a sci - fi film than the latest weapon in the fight against crime			1
but an innovative new tagging system using a gun and @entity10 pellets could make it easier for police to mark the cards of even the most volatile criminal			1
unlike a taser or gun that fires real bullets , the weapon wo n't hurt a suspect or render them incapacitated so that officers can pounce			2
the @entity40 , designed for use by police forces and the military by @entity45 - based firm @entity24 , fires small soft green pellets containing the transparent material at a target from as far away as 40 metres			1
each pellet , which weighs less than a gram and is effectively like a paintball , contains a unique @entity10 code which could remain on the target for weeks			2
@entity53 from @entity24 said : ' on contact with the target the uniquely - coded @entity55 solution leaves a synthetic dna trace mark that will enable the relevant authorities to confirm or eliminate that person from their involvement in a particular situation and could ultimately lead to arrest and prosecution			1
' the material is small enough to penetrate through clothing and mark a suspect 's skin as well as their clothing , the firm said			1
the gun comes in both pistol and shotgun form , with the power to fire 20 shots in one session			2
tagging : the gun fires small green pellets , like paintballs , which do n't hurt suspects but leave a unique dna trace which can last weeks it will prove useful for officers when policing riots or when facing crowd control problems , say the brains behind the futuristic invention			1
it could also be used when an officer is giving chase to an offender and is unable to keep up			0
the dna tag can be identified later on using a uv light and is designed to ensure that officers are arresting the right person			1
the company unveiled the new product in @entity99 , in the @entity100 last week , and said the response had been incredible			0
' it 's been 12 months in development , even though it only launched a few days ago , there has been a huge amount of interest , ' said @entity108 of @entity24			0
' we are in talks with several @entity25 police forces , and other around the world			1
' this is one of many tools in the police arsenal for a riot situation , and we believe its a deterrent , because it 's orange , people would know they can be tagged and would disperse			2
' the gun also has a laser sight , and video and audio recording capabilities to collect evidence			0
' each officer has a batch of @entity10 signed out to them , and when combined with the video and audio we think this provides a substantial amount of evidence			0
' the firm has even trained a sniffer to recognise the material , allowing police to detain crowds and easily find those who have been tagged			1
the gun is an extension of an existing property marking system offered by the company which is used by businesses and homeowners across the world			0
last year , police in @entity146 , @entity147 , saw a 100 per cent reduction in burglary when they offered @entity150 marking to 600 local residents			0
it was also revealed earlier this month that fast food giant @entity153 teamed up with the firm to install a spray in more than 700 stores which covers thieves in dna linking them to a specific crime for several months			1
the chain took the drastic action following a spate of robberies in its @entity164 outlets over @entity165 and @entity166			0
volatile : the gun could help police to track suspects involved in riots such as those which hit @entity172 in 2011 ( pictured ) individual signature : each round of pellets contains a unique strand of dna @entity24 says that its products , including the new gun , uniquely mark valuable products in the home or criminals themselves with a synthetic dna			1
each round of pellets in the @entity186 system features a unique dna code , meaning that an individual criminal who is shot by one of the pellets , can be traced back to the scene using a specific forensic signature			2
following an incident , details of codes are recorded on a police and insurance approved database so that when @entity10 is found on a suspect it can be matched against an incident			0
the company say that the dna in the pellets is completely synthetic so the number of unique codes is infinite			2
the system can not be hacked as prior knowledge of special ' key codes ' is needed to identify the dna strands			0
this means that the type of code read by police can not be copied or made up by third parties			0
the pellet does not hurt criminals nor is it toxic and the @entity10 contains a uv tracer so that the mark left on a suspect can be found if they stand under a special lamp .			0

@entity25 firm behind the gun in talks with several @entity25 police forces
dna pellets can tag clothes and penetrate through to skin - staying there for weeks
allows police can tag *troublemakers* during riots
officers can then use the trace to place suspects at the scene of a crime using uv readers or sniffer dogs to find those tagged
