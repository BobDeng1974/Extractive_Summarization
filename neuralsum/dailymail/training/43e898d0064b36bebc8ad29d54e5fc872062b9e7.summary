by @entity0 published : 04:23 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 04:24 est , 18 october 2013 @entity2 may be to blame for turning the word like into a verb , but @entity5 is set to take this a step further			0
according to a new patent filed by the internet giant , @entity5 wants its glass wearers to like brands , products and locations simply by making a heart shape with their hands			1
a camera on the headmounted device scans and recognises the item being liked and stores its details in a list of favourites , which can then be shared			0
a patent filed in the @entity23 shows @entity5 's plans to let its glass users generate a like by creating a heart shape with their hands in front of real - life objects , pictured			1
the headmounted device would then scan the item to record that the wearer likes that particular brand , product or location @entity5 is putting the finishing touches to a smartwatch that could be unveiled ' within weeks ' , according to industry insiders			1
the watch , believed to be codenamed gem , could take advantage of the work @entity5 has been doing on its @entity43 wearable computer			2
it could also use the same @entity46 alerts for directions and text messages as the eyewear			0
the patent is called ' hand gestures to signify what is important ' and was made public on wednesday			1
in one diagram , hands shaped as a heart are shown in front of a painting , while another shows the hand gesture being used in front of building sign			0
@entity5 explains in the patent : ' @entity64 gestures can be used to provide user input to a wearable computing device , and in particular to identify , signify , or otherwise indicate what may be considered or classified as important or worthy of attention or notice			1
' a wearable computing device , which could include a headmounted display ( @entity72 ) and a video camera , may recognise known hand gestures and carry out particular actions in response			0
' particular hand gestures could be used for selecting portions of a field of view of the @entity72 , and generating images from the selected portions			0
' it is thought the technology could use , or build on , @entity5 's existing goggles app , demonstration image pictured , that lets people take photos of items and find them online			2
this includes scanning products in shops , to compare online prices , for example , or landmarks to find a location on a map this flow chart from @entity5 's patent explains the process of how a head - mounted device could scan a hand gesture , recognise the object and save it online in simple terms , a user would frame any real - world object with a heart - shaped hand gesture and a built - in camera would scan the frame and ' like ' the highlighted product or location			1
@entity5 could also expand the type and number of hand gestures the technology recognises to include thumbs - up gestures , pointing , forming an @entity119 ( for like ) with a thumb and forefinger or circling items with a loop			0
the ' wearable computing device ' likely refers to @entity5 's @entity43 technology , yet the patent 's wording suggests it could be applied to any form of headmounted wearable technology			1
it is also thought the technology could use , or build upon , @entity5 's existing goggles app that lets people take photos of items and find them online			2
this includes scanning products in shops , to compare online prices , for example , or scanning landmarks to find a location on a map .			0

@entity5 's patent is called ' @entity64 gestures to signify what is important '
users hold their hands in a heart shape in front of objects to ' like ' them
@entity43 , or other headmounted devices , scan and recognise the item
a ' like ' is created for that product or location and can be stored or shared
