by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 04:23 est , 28 september 2013 he says he is often absent - minded , will forget why he walked into a room and struggles to remember what is on his shopping list			2
but @entity5 never forgets a face , and his unusual talent has seen him recruited as one of a new breed of crimefighters – a @entity11 ‘ super-recogniser ’			2
several years ago , police in @entity13 were on the lookout for a man wanted for nine burglaries			1
about a month after seeing the suspect ’s picture , @entity17 was stuck in traffic with two of his colleagues			2
never forgets a face : when police are trying to identify suspects from a crime @entity5 scans the surveillance footage before heading out on his normal police officer duties			1
the @entity29 knows if he sees someone once , he never forgets a face ‘ i looked up and noticed this guy coming out of a university and knew it was him , ’ he said			2
he quickly arrested the suspect , who went on to confess to the burglaries			1
he added : ‘ if i ’ve met someone before and see them again , i ’ll usually know where i know them from , even if i ca n’t remember their name			2
’ but the 30 - year - old officer said his incredible capacity to remember faces tends not to help him in his everyday life			2
‘ i ’m quite forgetful with basic things , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ll walk into a room and forget what i was coming in for , or i ’ll drive to the shops and get a load of stuff except for what i was supposed to get			2
i ’m not good with a shopping list			0
’ @entity29 officers designated as @entity56 examine surveillance footage such as this still of @entity58 , pictured left smiling on @entity59 during the riots in @entity62 city centre , and right , outside court			1
she was found guilty of stealing two left - footed trainers			0
so far the ' super recognisers ' are only operating in @entity13 @entity11 has now transferred mr @entity5 to their super-recogniser team , an elite squad of around 200 @entity13 officers trained to identify criminal suspects			1
psychologists are still baffled by their abilities , but officials say they have tripled the number of successful identifications they make every week and even helped prevent muggings , drug deals and assaults			1
police officers with unusually sensitive facial recognition skills have been identified within the @entity81			1
they all hold front line positions , in units such as the @entity84 , @entity85 , intelligence units , or in custody suites , where they keep up a good knowledge of local trouble makers			0
when necessary they will be required to view stills and videos from footage of crime scenes so they can become familiar with suspects they are looking for			1
they are then on the lookout for these people as they go about their usual front line duties , be it as part of the @entity103 or others			1
@entity105 , @entity106 at the @entity29 's @entity107 , said in an email that the ' super recognisers ' identify on average about 100 suspects a week in @entity13			1
he said : ' they have had a very good " hit rate "			0
for example pc @entity114 from @entity116 produced 180 idents from riot footage			0
the current conviction rate ( in general ) for riot matters is 87 per cent			0
' every person identified by an officer as being a potential suspect is followed up , ' in the same manner as fingerprint and dna evidence , ' he said			1
' in the case of images , a @entity129 reviews the identification and research is done on the named person to establish if their location / offending pattern matches the crime in question			0
' very few people are charged on ident evidence alone - a detective would arrest the subject and question him ... and search for the clothing in the image or the stolen property etc , ' he said in email			1
' in the case of a very serious crime e.g. murder , by knowing the @entity56 we can ensure that these officers see any images first - ensuring that we limit the possibility of false identifications / wrong leads			0
' he added : ' it is another tactic to make @entity13 safer and make best use of our resources			1
' detective chief inspector @entity105 said : ‘ when we have an image of an unidentified criminal , i know exactly who to ask instead of sending it out to everyone and getting a bunch of false leads			0
’ he decided to set up the unit in 2011 after realising that the police could identify criminals based on their dna and fingerprints , but had nothing to help them find suspects solely by using their images			1
the team has so far been remarkably successful – even outperforming facial recognition computer programs			1
they proved especially valuable during the @entity13 riots in summer 2011			1
after the violence subsided , @entity11 combed through hundreds of hours of surveillance video			0
so far there have been nearly 5,000 arrests – and around 4,000 of those were based on police identifications of suspects from video images			1
the super-recognisers were responsible for nearly 30 per cent of the identifications , including one officer who found around 300 people			1
however a facial recognition program made only one successful identification			1
@entity11 says the team also prevented thefts and assaults at last month ’s @entity200 – and even helped catch a drug dealer			0
mr @entity105 admitted that the officers , like the @entity11 ’s specially trained sniffer dogs , are not infallible			0
he explained that their identification is often only the start of a case which prompts police to start looking for other evidence			0
but legal experts warned that it could be problematic to use super-recognisers as expert witnesses in court if they have identified criminals based on an imperfect image			2
@entity216 , a law professor at the @entity217 , said : ‘ unless we subject them to rigorous testing , then we are just taking their word on trust			0
‘ perhaps they can do what they say , but we do n’t have the evidence yet			0
if it was up to me , i would not allow it in court			0
’ and @entity232 , from @entity231 privacy group @entity59 , claimed the unit was just ‘ the latest gimmick ’ to promote the widespread use of surveillance cameras			0
he said : ‘ it is a slippery slope when we want to start to justify the widespread use of blanket surveillance just in case a policeman spots someone			0
the use of super-recognisers will lead to cases of mistaken identity and forms part of a surveillance culture that spreads fear and distrust			0
’ @entity252 was caught on @entity59 making an obscene gesture to the camera while her daughter stands beside her , a blue scarf wrapped around her head			0
@entity258 and her daughter were arrested and given custodial sentences for their looting			2
it is not known if @entity258 , right , was found by a ' super recogniser ' @entity264 ( centre ) was filmed trying on trainers from a looted @entity267 at the @entity268 in north @entity13			1
in this case police were tipped off and found stolen goods in @entity264 's home			0

they identified around *1,300* suspects arrested in *relation* to the 2011 riots
computer recognition *systems* identified just three people from the riots
every week the ' super recognisers ' identify around 100 suspects in @entity13
