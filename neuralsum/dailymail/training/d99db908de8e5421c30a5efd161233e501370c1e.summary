a senior official at the @entity37 , they say she may have the administrative skills to run the @entity39 but has no knowledge of procedure – on which the clerk must advise mps			2
miss @entity13 has been dubbed the ‘ @entity49 caterer ’ because her duties there involved running the @entity37 kitchens			2
the speaker told @entity25 on monday that he acknowledged the barrage of concerns from mps on all sides and announced a ‘ pause ’ in the recruitment process			1
mps piled in later that afternoon , with eleven of them raising ‘ points of order ’ to question him over the issue as the prime minister looked on			1
last night , according to insiders at a private meeting of @entity29 , mr @entity1 stoked the row by joking to colleagues : ‘ i considered raising a couple of points of order myself ’			0
the prime minister added : ‘ what am i supposed to do with the letter he ’s given me ? give it to the @entity23 or stuff it down the back of the sofa ? ’			1
former transport minister @entity78 lead the charge in @entity25 today asking mr @entity3 : ‘ will you be withdrawing [ the letter ] until after the pause has been completed … or will it just float around in no 10 until some relevant point ? ’ ' @entity49 caterer ' : @entity13 ' appointment has been criticised by mps from all parties and this week mr @entity3 announced he was ' pausing ' the recruitment process @entity13 is the current @entity89 secretary in @entity49 , @entity6 , a service department that supports the work of the @entity25 and is the principal support agency for @entity93			1

recruitment consultants had been brought in for the first time to conduct a global search for candidates			0
in a face - saving move , mr @entity3 has agreed to hold a consultation on whether the post should be split			2
but mps now consider it unlikely she will take up the role either way			0
in his first interview since the scandal started brewing last month , mr @entity3 claimed it was ‘ damning ’ that none of the 84 most senior commons officials was from an ethnic minority			0
the speaker has recommended the 650 - year - old job of clerk be split in two , with @entity127 @entity126 fulfilling the role of chief executive overseeing management , and another official to advise mps on procedure			1

mr @entity158 raised a point of order in the commons earlier today , claiming that the recruitment firm advising on the appointment of the clerk was stopped from giving evidence about the suitability of @entity13 for the job			1
mr @entity3 said the @entity11 mp was ' unfortunately , but fairly predictably ' wrong			0
but mr @entity158 has insisted that the recruitment consultants @entity172 were prevented from telling the panel advising on the appointment that miss @entity13 was under two investigations by the @entity37			2
in his letter to the speaker , mr @entity158 wrote : ‘ @entity172 did wish to provide further information about ms @entity126 , including the fact that she is under two investigations by the @entity37 , but this offer was rejected			0
you may now wish to put the record straight			0
’ the @entity22 is the impartial main political adviser to the @entity93 , and adviser on all its procedure and business			0
