@entity1 senators remain irritated with their @entity3 colleagues who last week sent a letter to @entity6 leaders undercutting president @entity7 , but they will still back bipartisan legislation that would give @entity9 final say over a nuclear deal			1
enough members of the president 's party have signaled support for that bill and another that would impose new sanctions on @entity6 if it does n't make an agreement with negotiators that the @entity21 would be powerless to stop the measures from going into effect once passed			1
the @entity7 administration and its international partners now have until march 24 to set up the framework for a deal			1
@entity29 and @entity32 are the chief sponsors of one of the bills that would restrict the executive branch 's negotiating authority after that , a dozen @entity1 senators , including @entity47 of @entity48 , @entity49 of @entity50 and @entity32 of @entity51 , the highest - ranking @entity34 on the @entity33 , have said they will join with the @entity3 majority to pass bills inserting themselves into the process			1
one would levy additional sanctions on @entity6 after june 30 if it does n't agree to the final terms of a deal , though monthly waivers would be allowed should more time be requested			1
the other would give the @entity33 the power to reject within 60 days any pact the executive branch makes with @entity6			1
democrats who spoke with @entity67 voiced their displeasure with the 47 @entity3 senators who wrote a letter to @entity6 notifying the country 's leaders that any contract it makes with the @entity7 administration would be nullified when a new president takes office in january 2017 , whereas most members of the upper chamber would be in office for years to come			1
but that has n't changed their position on the core issue , they 've said			2
' the letter ’s incredibly unfortunate and inappropriate , ' @entity49 said			0
' that does n’t diminish my support for the legislation that we introduced			0
' @entity92 sen. @entity91 similarly said the missive was ' simply unacceptable ' and ' brought hyperpartisanship to an issue that we need to maintain our bipartisanship in			0
' he added : ' that does n’t change my support for that bill			2
' @entity47 last week called @entity3 ' actions ' unconscionable ' and bemoaned them for disrespecting the president			0
at the time , he said the bipartisan coalition of senators willing to buck the @entity21 was ' in tatters			2
' @entity47 told @entity107 that he was determined to ' stitch it back together , ' though			0
a week later it appeared that the group was holding strong and that @entity33 foreign relations @entity29 , one of just seven @entity3 senators who did not sign the ' open letter , ' was correct in predicting last thursday that the whole thing would blow over			2
' let a couple days go by			0
we think there ’s going to be really ignited momentum , ' @entity29 had told @entity67			0
we ’ve had reaffirmed commitment			0
' @entity1 senators remain irritated with their @entity3 colleagues who last week sent a letter to @entity6 leaders , but they will still back bipartisan legislation that would give @entity9 final say over a nuclear deal			1
freshman sen. @entity126 of @entity127 , pictured here last wednesday on @entity40 , authored the missive to @entity129 meanwhile , republicans who did sign the letter triumphantly declared on the sunday news shows that they had no ' regrets ' about sending @entity129 the strongly worded message			0
' i stand by the letter , ' @entity136 chairman @entity135 said on @entity140 's @entity139			0
' i think it 's interesting that we 've had so much talk about process , just like we 've had talk about process with prime minister @entity149 's speech , rather than dealing with the substance , ' the @entity141 @entity3 asserted , referring to @entity21 @entity3 leadership 's end run around the @entity21 earlier this year when it invited @entity154 pm @entity149 to address @entity9			2
senate majority leader @entity155 told @entity107 he thinks it was ' fair ' for republicans to explain that @entity9 will be involved in the process one way or another			2
' i do n’t think it was a mistake , ' he said of the message to @entity129			0
' the administration would like to have a distraction , but the point is the subject of the matter , ' the @entity3 leader said			0
' apparently , the @entity7 administration is on the cusp of entering into a very bad deal with one of the worst regimes in the world			1
' @entity127 sen. @entity126 , the author of the @entity3 letter , said on @entity174 ' @entity175 that ' @entity6 ’s leaders needed to hear the message loud and clear			2
' ' i can tell you they are not hearing the message from @entity182 , ' he told show host @entity183			0
secretary of state @entity37 , who has primarily led talks with @entity129 on behalf of the @entity185 , lambasted letter signers on sunday , saying , ' i ’ve never seen anything like this			0
' @entity37 , a former @entity189 senator , warned that negotiations would likely extend beyond the end of the month			0
' we believe very much that there ’s not going to be anything that ’s going to change in april or may or june that suggests that a decision you ca n’t make now will be made then , ' he said in a separate appearance on @entity175			0
secretary of state @entity37 , who has primarily led talks with @entity129 on behalf of the @entity185 , warned sunday that negotiations would likely extend beyond @entity1 ' deadline for an agreement framework - march 24 the @entity21 has threatened to veto @entity33 legislation interfering with the administration 's attempt to convince @entity129 to put aside its nuclear ambitions			1
@entity7 's chief of staff @entity205 again told @entity29 , a sponsor of the 60 - day review bill along with predecessor @entity32 , in a saturday note that the president would not sign legislation usurping his ability to unilaterally approve these types of agreements with foreign governments			2
@entity205 said in the letter to @entity29 that the @entity21 has ' welcomed @entity9 ’ important role ' in talks before essentially instructing the legislative branch to butt out			1
the @entity29 - @entity32 legislation ' goes well beyond ensuring that @entity9 has a role to play in any deal with @entity6 , ' @entity205 contended , and could set a ' potentially damaging precedent			1
' on monday , the @entity21 reiterated its stance that @entity9 has thoroughly been consulted during negotiations and vowed to continue involving the legislature when the time comes to talk about removing sanctions on @entity6			1
claims to the contrary are ' baloney , ' the president 's spokesman , @entity229 , said , @entity229 said that legislation giving @entity9 60 days to reject a deal would suggest to the @entity6 that the @entity185 may not stick to its end of the bargain			1
' we ca n't have a situation where you have people in the @entity9 back seat driving , ' the @entity7 administration official said			1
if @entity1 and @entity3 in the @entity33 stick together , the @entity21 will not be able undo their work			1
supporters of the bills now number in the mid 60s			0
a vote of 66 lawmakers or more in favor of the measures would tie the president 's hands			0
@entity254 sen. @entity253 said sunday it was ' unrealistic ' for the @entity21 to think that @entity9 would n't have a say in any dealings with @entity6 , however			1
' i have supported the negotiations to this point , but any deal that touches upon the congressional statutory sanctions is gon na get a review of @entity9 , and the only question is are you going to have a constructive , deliberate bipartisan process , or are you going to be rushed and partisan , ' he said on @entity139 .			2

the @entity21 would be powerless to stop the measures from going into effect once passed if as many @entity1 as *expected* defect
one bill would levy additional sanctions on @entity6 if it does n't agree to the final terms of a deal ; the other would give the @entity33 the power to reject any pact the executive branch makes with the country
the @entity7 administration and its international partners now have until march 24 to set up the framework for an agreement or the @entity33 will act
@entity9 ' complaints are ' baloney ' @entity21 spokesman said monday
' we ca n't have a situation where you have people in the @entity9 back seat driving , ' he said
