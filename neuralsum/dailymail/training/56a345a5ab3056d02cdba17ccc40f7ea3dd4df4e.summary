by @entity1 reporter a @entity3 fan left brain damaged after being beaten in a @entity6 parking lot won his negligence lawsuit on wednesday			2
a jury agreed that the @entity9 did not provide adequate security and were partly to blame for the attack that left father - of - two @entity13 permanently disabled			1
@entity13 's father @entity14 said that his son probably would n't understand the details of the settlement that will give him nearly $ 15 million from the @entity9 , ' but @entity13 will know that he got some help today			1
what he gets is going to help him through now , and that 's what he needs , ' @entity29 said			0
the jury delivered its verdict in a @entity36 courtroom after weeks of testimony about the assault after the opening day baseball game in 2011 between the rival teams			1
@entity13 , 45 , was left with disabling brain damage and became a symbol of violence at sporting events			1
he was in the courtroom for part of the trial , his wheelchair positioned front and center so jurors could see the scars on his head where his skull was temporarily removed during medical efforts to save his life			0
experts testified that the former @entity57 paramedic @entity13 will never work again and has suffered repeated strokes and seizures			1
they said he will require round - the - clock care			1
lawyers for @entity13 claimed the team and former owner @entity63 failed to provide adequate security			1
in split decisions , jurors found that the @entity9 were negligent but absolved @entity63			1
in civil cases , only nine of 12 jurors must agree on the verdict			0
life - changing : @entity13 , pictured on a stretcher while being moved to a new hospital in 2011 , still needs round - the - clock care closure : @entity13 's parents @entity75 , center , and @entity77 , right , said they were satisfied with the jury 's decision the @entity9 ' did have a ( security ) plan but somewhere along the line that plan broke			1
and it needed to be fixed , ' juror @entity83 said after the verdict			0
' hopefully we helped to fix it ... if you 're going to own a stadium , do it right , ' he added			2
jurors determined that @entity13 suffered about $ 18 million in damages in the form of lost earnings , medical expenses , and pain and mental suffering			1
the @entity9 must pay about $ 15 million of that because while finding the team negligent , jurors assigned it only a portion of the responsibility for @entity13 's harm , said his attorney , @entity102			1
@entity13 's attackers shared the rest of the responsibility for @entity13 's harm , jurors determined			2
however , they were n't sued and so can not be required to pay a share of the damages			0
@entity13 's parents pronounced themselves satisfied with the jury 's award even though it is only about half of what they had sought			1
' we 'll make it work for him , ' his mother , @entity113 , said			0
trial : dodger fans @entity118 , not pictured , and @entity119 , left , pleaded guilty to attacking @entity13 safety : security has been bolstered at the @entity9 stadium in the wake of the 2011 attack the defense had argued that security was stronger than ever at an opening day contest and contended that @entity13 was partially to blame because he was drunk			1
but jurors were unanimous in deciding that @entity13 's own negligence was n't a substantial factor in causing his harm			2
@entity13 's mother said she held her husband 's hand as the court read that part of the verdict form			2
' i was so ecstatic because we know our son and we know that the picture the defense was trying to portray was not @entity13 at all , ' @entity113 said			2
they said they had not spoken to their son , who did not attend the hearing , but did talk to his sisters and expected they would talk to him			0
in @entity150 , @entity3 manager @entity149 said he was happy for the family that there was finally a verdict			0
' what happened should n't have happened			0
we have to keep that in mind			0
but also for the fans coming to the ballpark , you need the proper security , ' he said			0
' it should n't be a situation where you 're afraid to go to a game or you ca n't enjoy yourself			0
' dodger fans @entity118 and @entity119 pleaded guilty to the attack in criminal court after a lengthy preliminary hearing in which witnesses said security guards were absent from the parking lot where @entity13 was attacked			1
the complicated civil case even threw jurors at one point , who announced last week that they were deadlocked			0
the judge ordered them to resume deliberations			0
' they struggled through it , ' @entity179 , an attorney for the @entity9 , said after the verdict			2
' remember , after four days they had not found liability on the part of the defendants			0
that is quite telling , i think , in and of itself			0
' in the wake of the attack , the @entity9 and @entity36 police increased their security at games , including adding more patrols and undercover officers wearing rival team jerseys .			1
