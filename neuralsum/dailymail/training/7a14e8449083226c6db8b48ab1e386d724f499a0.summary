in his choice of vice- captains , @entity0 has avoided the charge levelled at @entity4 that the @entity6 management team has a hint of ‘ @entity8 ’ about it			1
if there is any concern about the @entity14 captain ’s five wise men it is due to the sheer number of them			2
there will certainly be any number of opinions for him to draw on , with a broad range of experience , including two men who have won matches themselves in his role			2
@entity0 has explained that he liked the way having five vice- captains worked at @entity28 and the extra demands that come with being in charge of the home side require additional support @entity34 vice captains @entity35 ( left ) , @entity36 ( centre ) and @entity38 ( right ) @entity4 and @entity40 's vice captains are @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 they will be used in a variety of ways : as his eyes and ears out on the course , a source of wise counsel , as morale - boosters and motivators , and taking charge of certain groups of players — in the build - up and during the three days of the event itself			1
@entity0 believes these are people in whom he can place absolute trust			1
@entity62 beneath his carefree and cigar - chomping exterior the @entity63 is reckoned to have an astute analytical golfing brain			0
he already has leadership experience , having captained @entity14 in the much lower profile @entity69			0
completely tuned in with the players , he is likely to be casting his eye over @entity72 and @entity73 , among others			0
@entity75 the 61 - year - old @entity76 has the lowest profile of the quintet			1
he still plays on the veterans ’ tour and , like many of his compatriots , was a renowned expert at mastering wet and windy conditions			0
when @entity0 came on to the circuit as a player @entity75 served almost as a father figure and mentor to him			1
he will be a reassuring sounding board for the captain			0
@entity76 @entity75 has arguably the lowest profile of @entity34 's five vice captains @entity0 and one of his vice captains , @entity94 ahead of the @entity95 @entity36 few men are more synonymous with the @entity95 than the gravel - voiced @entity97 , who made eight appearances as a player and was then a winning captain in 2002			1
closely linked with @entity0 , partly through his late father @entity103 who coached the @entity76 , there is no aspect of the competition he has not experienced one way or the other			1
this competition ’s ultimate wise old bird			0
@entity110 @entity0 goes back so far with the major winner that they were actually at school together and served a joint apprenticeship playing alongside each other in amateur competitions			2
like @entity62 , the one - time aspiring accountant has an analytical mind and is plugged into the tour			0
he has a kinship with @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity38 the man who presided over the miracle of @entity125 is sufficiently ego - free to slot in comfortably as a deputy			2
emotional and an excellent speaker in the team room , he will be one to inject some real feeling in there if needed			0
@entity125 gives him natural authority , although @entity0 will hope that he did not use up all his @entity95 luck last time out			2
@entity0 talks 24 - year - old @entity134 @entity73 ahead of his first @entity95 experience @entity34 are favourites for the @entity95 having won seven of the last nine tournaments @entity138 's @entity14			1

@entity4 has been accused of *picking* an ageing set of vice captains
but @entity0 has gone for *safety* in numbers
@entity34 will have five *vice-captains*
they are @entity94 , @entity38 , @entity35 , @entity75 and @entity36
