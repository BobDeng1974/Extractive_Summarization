" she should write to us about the @entity179 being placed under the state government			0
she is a senior leader , we will consider it if she writes to us officially , " he said			0

there is foul play , " said @entity226 , the lawyer of the main defendant in the december 16 gang - rape case			1
he was seconded by other defence counsels in the case , who termed @entity2 's death a " well - planned murder " and refuted all theories of it being a suicide			1
they said they were informed by the four adult defendants on monday that they were being subjected to harassment in @entity8			1
