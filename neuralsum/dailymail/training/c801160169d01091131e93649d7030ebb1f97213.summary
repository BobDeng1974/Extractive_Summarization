by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:12 pm on 11th november 2011 ' @entity2 ' : @entity3 has secretly abolished passport checks for foreigners entering the @entity6 on certain flights a second relaxation of border controls authorised by @entity3 has allowed thousands to enter @entity6 without passport checks , it emerged today			1
the ' smart zone ' system was quietly introduced at @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity20 / @entity19 airports last year			0
it means some passengers are security - screened before take - off and face only a ' light touch ' inspection on their arrival			1
the minimal checks have resulted in those on ' low risk ' routes into the @entity6 passing through border control in half the time previously taken			1
the system makes it easier for illegal immigrants , criminals and terrorists to enter the country unchallenged			1
the new rules were revealed by the @entity39 with the home secretary already under fire for a separate , secret move in the summer to relax passport checks at all airports			1
' smart zone allows us to pre-check people on low - risk routes and , therefore , to provide a faster , lighter - touch , screening of passengers at the port , ' said the @entity52 , in a report seen by the newspaper			1
' this is better for passengers and allows us to use our staff ’s expertise at spotting the unknown risk , rather than routinely processing documents			1
' the report shows the @entity63 are putting an end to the processing of passports and other travel documents for selected flights , the newspaper said			0
low security : the ' smart zone ' system means passengers are only screened before take - off , making it far easier for terrorists and illegal immigrants to slip through the net insiders claim the tactics could pave the way for full - blown profiling of travellers based on race , according to the @entity39			1
further trials of the system are planned for @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity87 airports , and some coach parties arriving from @entity89 have been ushered in under the relaxed new policy			0
the @entity92 coastal city is a notorious entry route used by people - trafficking networks , who have been known to charge migrants up to £ 5,000 to smuggle them into @entity6			1
mrs may faced three days of grilling this week over her involvement in disgraced ex-border chief @entity101 's reckless relaxation of passport checks			2
the home secretary admitted she authorised a pilot scheme relaxing checks on @entity107 nationals , but insisted mr @entity101 had gone much further without her knowledge			2
fighting back : border chief @entity101 is suing the home secretary for constructive dismissal , as he claims she knew all about his relaxations of security controls mr @entity101 , who is bringing a six - figure lawsuit against mrs may for constructive dismissal , argued that mrs may was aware of all his actions			2
over the summer , he allegedly allowed the suspension of checks on @entity118 nationals , and let staff stop checking against a warning index of terror suspects and illegal immigrants			1
during tense exchanges in the @entity125 on wednesday , mrs may admitted that an internal @entity52 document leaked on monday did ‘ reflect government policy ’			0
it showed that staff were told to ‘ cease routinely opening the chip ’ within biometric passports from @entity107 nations			0
she also agreed to suspend so - called warning index checks for children travelling with an @entity107 passport with their family or on a school trip , sparking fears that a trafficked child could slip through the net			2
mr @entity101 will give evidence to mps next week which could cause further trouble for mrs may following calls for her resignation this week			0
@entity149 mp @entity148 yesterday asked sir @entity150 , the head of the @entity151 , to investigate the conduct of mrs may ’s aides in relation to mr @entity101			0
@entity155 , the immigration minister , said in parliament that @entity52 was reviewing its processes			0
he said : ' smart zones are one part of this and operate by using information gathered through the @entity163 system [ a programme that collects electronic records of everyone entering and leaving the country ] to conduct enhanced watch - list checks in advance of arrival			2
' ' passengers are then directed through a designated smart zone where the appropriate level of checks can be made on arrival			0
this has the potential to remove duplication of detailed checks at the border , improving the passenger experience while maintaining border security			1
' a @entity63 evaluation of the smart zone scheme is due next month			0
@entity185 officials said feedback from @entity52 staff , airlines and passengers had been positive			0
@entity52 was unable to comment today .			0

thousands allowed to enter without proper checks
minimal inspection meant those on ' low risk ' routes passed through @entity6 border control in half the time
