by @entity0 for @entity1 an eerie video claiming to show an ' alien ' figure walking on the moon went viral earlier this week			1
theories ranged from shadows cast by a nearby boulder to an ancient alien statue placed on the lunar surface			2
now @entity10 has announced the figure is simply ' dust , an eyelash [ or ] scratch on the negative ' of the film that took the image			1
@entity10 announced the shape is simply ' dust , an eyelash [ or ] scratch on the negative ' of the film that took the image seeing familiar things in random objects is nothing new			1
the phenomenon is called @entity35 is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus			1
it is a form of @entity41 , which is when people see patterns or connections in random , unconnected data			2
human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd , work out how fast a car is travelling , and see patterns			2
scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to ' enrich our imagination ' and recognise meaningful shapes , even when they 're not there			1
the video , showing the images , was posted by @entity61 and it has already been viewed more than two million times in less than a month			1
@entity63 , a deputy project scientist for the @entity64 ( @entity66 ) mission that is currently orbiting the moon , told @entity68 that the image was taken by either the @entity70 15 or 17 manned missions to the moon in 1971 and 1972 respectively			1
he points out that a current @entity66 does n't show any lunar feature that could cause that pattern on the ground			0
' my best guess , is that something ( dust , an eyelash , scratch on the negative ) was on the film , ' dr @entity63 told @entity68			1
' remember , this was in the pre-digital days when all sorts of nasty things could happen to film			2
' the popularity of the video can be explained by a psychological phenomenon called @entity35 , which is the brain 's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random stimulus			1
@entity93 said he started investigating the shadow , which can also be seen on @entity23 at 27 ° 34 ’ 26.35 ″ n 19 ° 36 ’ 4.75 ″ @entity95 , after receiving an online tip from another web user named @entity24			1
‘ an irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on @entity23 looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object , or figure , ’ @entity98 told @entity99			1
‘ at first i thought maybe it was something drawn into the picture but after going to @entity23 , whatever it is or is n't … uh , is there			1
’ ' an irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on @entity23 looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object , or figure , ' @entity98 told @entity99 @entity111 , a paranormal explainer , wrote in the examiner the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue , ' @entity114 ' , is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 bc. this is n’t the first time that @entity93 has spotted strange objects after ploughing through @entity121 ’s moon series			1
in january , the user highlighted controversial images which showed what some people believed could be a secret alien base or spaceship on the moon			1
the triangular anomaly , spotted on @entity121 's map of the moon , had rows of seven light - like dots along its edge			0
@entity111 , a paranormal explainer , wrote in the examiner that the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue , ' @entity114 ' , is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 bc ' is it just a weird looking crater ? or is it something else ? , ' he asked			0
' it is really there , not faked and i have no clue what it is			0
i found nothing else like it in any of the other craters			0
' according to website tech and @entity152 : ' the gigantic shape actually looks like the leading edge of an immense , triangular space ship , similar to , so far , super secret stealth aircraft technology , but is much larger than any airplane ever built on @entity158			0
' the regularly spaced , circular promontory shapes which make up the seven points on the perfectly formed triangle wedge seem to be intelligently designed			0
this triangular anomaly with rows of seven light - like dots along its edge has been tracked down on the @entity23 viewer the two - sided , triangular feature on the lunar surface , was uncovered paranormal researcher @entity170			2
it can be found on the @entity23 viewer at coordinates 22042 ' @entity174 and 142034 ' @entity175 @entity23 works in a similar way to @entity158			2
it was launched in 2009 on the 40th anniversary of the @entity179 lunar landing			0
the landing site of each of the @entity70 missions is shown on the satellite image , providing more information on each mission as the user zooms in			1
the first version of @entity23 only included low - resolution satellite imagery of the entire moon , and when zoomed in too close , a @entity191 cheese pattern would appear			2
' to date , no other feature has ever been discovered which matches this shape on the moon , or any other planet observed by satellite or exploratory rover			0
' the anomaly is so huge , it 's possible it is some sort of moon base used as a facility for storing and launching alien @entity99 spacecraft			0
' the same @entity61 user also claims to have found a similar mystery structure on @entity158 , nestled under the ice in @entity206			1
' it is also a triangular shape , measuring 125 by 90mtres			0
' it is unique in the area , ' he said			0
