by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 07:32 est , 22 march 2012 scientists analysing the surface of a giant asteroid are puzzling over bright spots that represent some of the purest materials seen so far by a @entity7 spacecraft			1
@entity7 released new images of the asteroid @entity9 taken by the orbiting @entity11 spacecraft that show some places on the surface twice as bright as others			1
@entity9 is one of the brightest objects in the solar system and the only asteroid in the so - called main belt between @entity20 and @entity21 visible to the naked eye from @entity23			1
sparkling : bright material extends up to 19 miles out from the crater @entity26 on @entity9 , which measures six miles across this shows a perspective view of a layered young crater in the @entity31 basin at @entity9 created from laying images from the mission 's low - altitude mapping orbit - an average of 130 miles above the surface - atop a digital terrain model the bright material , found mostly around craters , appeared as a result of rocks slamming into the surface and exposing it			1
researchers are still trying to determine what it is made of but believe it is pristine and unchanged from the asteroid 's formation some four billion years ago			0
‘ our analysis finds this bright material originates from @entity9 and has undergone little change since the formation of @entity9 over four billion years ago , ’ said @entity50 , a @entity11 participating scientist at the @entity51 , @entity51			1
‘ we 're eager to learn more about what minerals make up this material and how the present @entity9 surface came to be			1
’ the bright areas vary from several hundred feet to around 10 miles across			0
the interplay of bright and dark material at the rim of @entity63 on @entity9 is visible in this image mosaic rock on : a young crater on @entity9 that is nine miles in diameter with layering visible in the crater walls , along with large boulders that were thrown out in the material ejected from the impact there are also a wide variety of distinct dark deposits across its surface			1
the dark materials on @entity9 can appear dark grey , brown and red			2
they sometimes appear as small , well - defined deposits around impact craters			0
they also can appear as larger regional deposits , like those surrounding the impact craters scientists have nicknamed the ‘ snowman			0
’ ‘ one of the surprises was the dark material is not randomly distributed , ’ said @entity88 , a @entity11 participating scientist at @entity89			0
‘ this suggests underlying geology determines where it occurs			0
’ the dark materials seem to be related to impacts and their aftermath			0
scientists theorise carbon - rich asteroids could have hit @entity9 at speeds low enough to produce some of the smaller deposits without blasting away the surface			2
@entity11 has been studying @entity9 since it entered orbit last year			2
the spacecraft is set to depart @entity9 this summer and cruise to another asteroid , @entity108 , arriving in 2015			2
this artist 's concept shows @entity7 's @entity11 orbiting the giant asteroid @entity9 with the depiction of @entity9 based on images obtained by the craft 's framing cameras			0

the bright material appeared as a result of rocks slamming into the surface
@entity9 is one of the brightest objects in the solar system
