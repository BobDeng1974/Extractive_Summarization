the term ' a fish out of water ' describes someone taken from his natural environment to one he 's not comfortable in			0
but a group catfish in one odd ecological pocket have shown themselves to be rather comfortable with leaping on to dry land			0
a study published yesterday investigates the remarkable phenomenon of the catfish that hunt pigeons			2
lying in wait : a catfish lurks in the waters of the @entity16 while it waits for a pigeon to stray too close pounce : the fish lunges from the water and snaps up the bird in its jaws catfish in south - west @entity23 have been spotted leaping from a river to snap up the unsuspecting birds , before wriggling back beneath the water to swallow them			1
the unusual behaviour - similar to the way some marine mammals beach themselves to snap up prey from the shore - has never been seen among catfish in their native range			1
it has led researchers the @entity39 to dub them ' freshwater killer whales '			0
between 1m and 1.5m long , @entity43 catfish are the largest freshwater fish on the continent and third largest in the world			0
most catfish are bottom feeders , consuming aquatic plants , other fish , decaying vegetation , fish eggs and crayfish as well as snails , aquatic bugs and minnows			0
feeding ground : researchers spent five months watching the catfish from a bridge over a small gravel island over a stretch of the @entity63 passing through the city centre of @entity65 , north - east of @entity66 however in the @entity16 , where they where introduced in the early @entity68 , they seem have adapted their natural behaviour to capture prey in their new environment			1
researchers spent five months watching the catfish from a bridge over a small gravel island over a stretch of the @entity63 passing through the city centre of @entity65 , an ancient town about 50 miles north - east of @entity66			1
over that period they observed 54 beaching incidents , in which the catfish managed to snap up a bird 28 per cent of the time , dragging them back into the water to gobble them up			2
while the beachings were quick - lasting from less than one second to no more than four seconds - in about 40 per cent of cases the fish lunged so far from the water that more than half their bodies were exposed			0
just when you thought it was safe : in five months they observed 54 beaching incidents , in which the catfish managed to snap up a bird 28 per cent of the time , dragging them back into the water to gobble them up to go back in the water : the beachings were quick , but in about 40 per cent of cases the fish lunged so far from the water that more than half their bodies were exposed along comes a hungry catfish : the unusual behaviour - similar to the way some marine mammals beach themselves to snap up prey from the shore - has never been seen among catfish in their native range catfish are named for the long , sensitive whiskers ( known as barbels ) around their mouths , and the those of the @entity63 fish would perk up whenever they were hunting fish			1
that finding , combined with the fact that the fish only went for those pigeons who were moving , suggested the the catfish used water vibrations to hunt rather than visual cues			2
while the study highlights an interesting example of unusual behaviour , the researchers said the ecological causes that have led to the unusual adaptation are still unknown catfish were only introduced to the @entity63 in 1983 , and they now flourish there , leading the researchers to speculate that increased numbers of the fish could have led to a decline in marine prey			1
the findings were reported yesterday in the open - access journal @entity138 .			0

catfish in the @entity16 in south - west @entity23 are the only ones ever to be observed exhibiting the behaviour
researchers have no idea why they hunt the birds but speculate it could be because of declining prey
