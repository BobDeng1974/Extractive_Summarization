a good @entity0 did a good deed for a homeless man by giving him a @entity3 to pursue his love of reading			0
the @entity7 man , who wishes to remain anonymous , would take frequent business trips to @entity9 when he 'd often see a homeless man reading one book repeatedly			1
during his last visit , he decided to strike up a conversation with the man , called @entity15 , about his book and soon found out that he loved to read , but only had one book			1
@entity17 : @entity15 told the man that he loved to read books , but unfortunately he only had one book to read the man told @entity21 : ' i just asked him if he liked to read			1
he said he loved to but that he had been reading that one book over and over for a while now			0
' in a kind gesture , the man remembered that he was carrying his kindle in his bag , and decided to give it to @entity15 and teach him how to use it			1
it was soon clear how much @entity15 enjoyed using the device - which is an e-reader by @entity32			2
he decided to take a picture of @entity15 and his new @entity3 , and shared it on @entity35 on thursday under the username , mjuad			2
the photograph quickly went viral , receiving nearly two million views on @entity39 - which describes itself as the @entity41 's visual storytelling community where people post pictures			0
he said : ' it brought me a lot of joy to see someone getting so much from something that i gave them			0
it feels so good to see someone get so much for something i took for granted			0
' luckily , @entity15 does not need to download books			2
the @entity3 is already stocked with around 300 books			1
in another grand gesture , the man gave @entity15 an address where he could send the device , cash on delivery , should he need more reading material			1
he told the website : ' if i can keep someone from going hungry for a day or brighten their day / life up in any way , i always try to do my best			0
' i 'm also hoping that by sharing this , i will encourage others to do something kind as well			0
