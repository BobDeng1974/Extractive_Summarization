by @entity1 reporter published : 12:19 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 14:39 est , 20 march 2013 a bemused vicar was forced to turn into an amateur sleuth after she rang police to report a theft of lead from her church - and was told to preserve the thieves ' footprints in the snow herself			1
@entity12 discovered the wrought iron gates and lead from the porch of @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , near @entity18 , @entity19 , had been prised off			1
she found a trail of footprints in the snow and rang police , thinking they may help police to catch the thief			2
do it yourself : bemused @entity12 , pictured holding part of the broken porch , was told by police to try and preserve thieves footprints in the snow herself when she reported a theft from @entity15 near @entity18 , @entity19 but when she called @entity32 she was told officers were unable to attend until later and asked her to preserve the crime scene by herself			1
@entity35 said : ' i noticed the footprints in the snow so i followed them and found the lead had been stolen and the metal gates - they are about 4ft high and very heavy			1
evidence : the vicar had to point out to police officers that she could n't preserve the footprints as the snow was already melting ' the footprints i found were from an adult with big feet			1
' i rang police to report it and they asked if i would be to cover the set of footprints and preserve them until the police came out to see me later			2
' i said it would not be possible because the snow was melting and also i had a funeral later that day and they might be trampled on			2
' the only appointments available were 2pm or 4pm but the earlier one was not convenient , so they were not able to use the footprints			0
' i found the phone call quite humorous			0
' it is the third time @entity62 ' , a grade ii listed building , built in 1840 , has been targeted by lead thieves , who have already caused Â£ 5,500 worth of damage , this year			0
@entity35 said : ' to think of stealing from a church is about as low as you can go			0
' a @entity68 spokesman said : ' if someone is reporting a crime and there is possible evidence , it would be standard procedure to ask the caller if they could preserve this in any way			0
' in this particular case the rain on monday morning was starting to turn the snow to slush , so it would have been very difficult for a crime scene examiner to take any worthwhile prints even if they had been able to attend within a few hours			0
' following procedure : a spokesman for @entity32 said the advice given to @entity35 was standard procedure if officers could not attend the scene immediately			1

wrought iron gates and lead were prised off the porch of @entity15
@entity97 found footprints in snow around building near @entity18 , @entity19
but @entity32 were too busy to attend until later that day
officers then *suggested* @entity103 preserve the footprints herself
