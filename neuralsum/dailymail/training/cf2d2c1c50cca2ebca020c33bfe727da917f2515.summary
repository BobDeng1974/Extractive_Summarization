@entity2 ’s super strike to make it 1 - 1 was @entity3 ’s first at the @entity4 in more than four - and - a - half years			1
the last @entity3 player to find the back of the net on @entity8 was a certain @entity9 , now of @entity10			1
he curled a delightful equaliser in the final minute of a 1 - 1 draw in march , 2010			0
@entity9 , though , has failed to hit those heights in red and white and was absent with a knock			0
@entity2 celebrates scoring for @entity3 in their 4 - 1 win over @entity10 @entity17 ( right ) scores @entity3 's second and the striker gave them the lead for the first time in the game @entity23 , meanwhile , is another @entity24 player who cost the @entity10 £ 10m			1
and , like @entity9 , he has done little to suggest that was a bad piece of business on @entity3 ’s behalf			2
@entity23 started for @entity10 and gets to grips with former team - mate @entity2 @entity31 enjoys playing against @entity3			1
he scored twice during april ’s 2 - 2 draw at the @entity33 and got the opener			0
@entity31 has been in fine form of late and , with his contract set to expire at the end of the season , goals against the champions are sure to alert clubs on the lookout for what could be next summer ’s big bargain			2
@entity10 striker @entity31 ( centre ) scores against @entity47 to give @entity10 a surprise lead			0

@entity3 fell behind to an early goal from @entity31
