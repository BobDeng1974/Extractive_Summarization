' secret footage showed the former first minister , who is bidding to become an mp , mocking @entity6 after it slapped down its @entity10 leader @entity9 , who claimed he would write the party 's budget north of the border			1
' i knew that [ he would n't be writing it ] already – because i 'm writing the @entity15 budget , ' mr @entity0 declared to cheers at a fundraising event			2
he also joked that he would ' check his top pocket ' – a reference to a conservative election poster showing a miniature mr @entity21 in his breast pocket			0
it prompted @entity24 and @entity25 to join forces to warn of a looming ' constitutional crisis '			2
they questioned the legitimacy of the @entity1 's plan to try to put @entity21 in @entity31 , even if @entity6 wins fewer seats at the election			1
earlier in the day , the prime minister had tweeted the footage of mr @entity0 with the message : ' this footage will shock you : @entity0 laughs & boasts he 'll write @entity6 's budget			1
vote conservative to stop it			0
' mr @entity24 , in his first joint interview with the @entity44 mayor , his chief rival to the @entity46 leadership , said : ' in the last 48 hours the @entity1 have said ' no money spent on defence projects unless you get rid of @entity50 '			1
' no @entity51 unless it starts in @entity10 '			2
' you have now got @entity0 saying he wants to write @entity21 's budget			1
that 's before this has even happened			0
imagine how much worse it would be , imagine how many pockets would be picked if this were to happen			0
' the stakes at this election have always been high			0
it 's about sticking with a plan that 's working or risking it with @entity21			0
but frankly the stakes have got much higher because of what 's happening in @entity10 with the @entity1 potentially wiping out @entity6			1
' the way to avoid that outcome which would be unstable , bad for the economy , bad for jobs , bad for living standards , bad for this country 's prospects , the way to avoid it is to vote @entity40			0
' the @entity44 mayor , deployed to inject more passion into the @entity46 campaign , claimed it would mean ' truckfuls of taxpayers ' dosh growling up the @entity80 to @entity10 '			0
' lots of people ... people who might even have voted @entity6 ... will think that this is a constitutional crisis , ' he added			0
mr @entity25 , who is seeking to return to the @entity85 in the @entity44 seat of @entity87 and @entity88 , also said a @entity6 government dependent on the @entity1 's support would be ' totally shambolic '			1
the @entity1 has declared it will never support the @entity40 in a hung parliament , but it is ready to do a deal with @entity6 , even if it finishes in second place			2
it would be the first time since 1924 that a second - placed party had formed a government			0
mr @entity21 dismissed mr @entity0 's claim in the footage as ' fantasy and nonsense '			2
but he again refused to rule out relying on @entity1 votes in a hung parliament			0
@entity0 boasted that he would write @entity6 's first budget because the @entity1 would hold the balance of power mr @entity0 also joked that he would ' check his top pocket ' – a reference to a conservative election poster showing a miniature mr @entity21 in his breast pocket ( pictured above ) ' we are going to be writing the first @entity6 budget , ' he told @entity113			1
the @entity6 leader insisted he had no plans to negotiate , adding : ' i am going to put a @entity6 queen 's speech before the @entity85 and people will have to decide how they vote			2
' mr @entity21 also accused mr @entity24 of ' trying to stir up @entity120 hatred against the @entity10 ' by highlighting the threat posed by the @entity1 's left - wing agenda			1
responding to the leaked footage , mr @entity0 said mr @entity24 should ' try holding a few public meetings and meeting real people – and develop a sense of humour '			1
former @entity1 leader @entity0 has boasted that ' whoever holds the balance holds the power ' in @entity132 the video of mr @entity0 's remarks came after @entity24 tweeted the footage online earlier today the prime minister said @entity6 had not ruled out a deal with the @entity1 and would be held to ' ransom ' by mr @entity0 ' the point made in a light - hearted way was that @entity6 leader @entity9 had been slapped down by his party bosses at @entity142 and told that he would have no role in a @entity6 budget , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' @entity24 is clearly a prime minister with both a people bypass and a sense of humour bypass			0
' it came as @entity149 , mr @entity0 's successor , set out another policy demand for the entire @entity151 , saying that @entity1 mps would vote for a £ 24billion increase in @entity155 spending			1
last night , @entity6 deployed former prime minister @entity156 , who claimed the only way mr @entity24 can win the election ' is to build resentment in @entity10 of the @entity120 and resentment in @entity161 of the @entity10 '			1
however , he also warned that an @entity1 surge could lead to ' months of constitutional chaos '			0
@entity1 leader @entity149 was out campaigning today in the @entity165 area of @entity166 where she posed with a sign highlighting her hope of a hung parliament ms @entity149 has called for an increase in government spending of some £ 148billion and demanded her mps have a say over the running of the whole of the @entity151 , raising the prospect of @entity10 nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border			1
@entity182 bank warns of @entity6 risk to @entity151 jobs by @entity185 , @entity186 correspondent for the @entity187 a @entity6 government propped up by the @entity10 nationalists could be ' bad news for growth and jobs ' , one of @entity194 's biggest banks warned last night			1
analysts at @entity196 said that in return for helping @entity21 get into @entity198 , the @entity1 would push for more public spending and even another referendum on @entity10 independence			2
according to the bank , this could dent global investors ' confidence in the @entity151 ' as questions are raised over the durability of the country as it stands '			0
the report also claimed that a referendum on @entity151 's future in the @entity182 – as promised by the @entity40 – ' throws up concerns regarding trade '			0
