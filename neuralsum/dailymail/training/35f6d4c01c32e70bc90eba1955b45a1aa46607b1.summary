by @entity0 while parts of @entity3 are mopping up after flash floods and others are basking in warm weather , stranger things appear to be happening in the sky			0
one photographer captured sun streaming through the clouds which looked like a spaceship was about to land or something out of 70 ’s movie @entity14 , while another snapped a cloud in @entity17 in the shape of a magic carpet			1
photographer @entity20 was having dinner with his wife @entity22 at a restaurant at @entity24 , @entity25 , when the eery rays suddenly appeared from between the clouds and beamed onto the water			1
mr @entity20 , a former graphic designer , from @entity39 , @entity40 , said the light was changing for more than 15 minutes			2
he said : ‘ i have taken pictures of rays before but never quite like this			0
it brought to mind the sequences from the film ' @entity14 '			0
‘ i was pleasantly shocked and stunned because you never expect to witness anything like this			0
this was an outstanding sight and i was very lucky to be in the right place at the right time			0
’ mr @entity20 took more than 50 photos , including his favourite of a gull standing on the rocky cliff edge			2
the rays looked similar to a scene from @entity62 's 1977 sci - fi film @entity14 a message from outer space ? a seagull watches the bizarre light shining through the clouds at @entity24 he said : ‘ we looked out of the restaurant window and saw those rays starting to appear over the sea			2
once outside , the height of the cliffs was ideal because my eye level was above the horizon , giving me much more dramatic angles and perspectives			0
‘ i had to work fast because the light and rays were changing all the time and the atmosphere and moods were fantastic			0
’ meanwhile residents in @entity17 , @entity85 , were amazed when they spotted what looks like a flying carpet in the sky			1
magic carpet ride ? residents in @entity17 , @entity85 , took this incredible shot of a cloud in the shape of a rectangle unsurprisingly @entity95 experts rubbished claims this could be a close encounter of the third kind and explained the cloud was caused by a jet engine moving through a pocket of air but officials at the @entity95 was quick to dismiss the possibility of an encounter of the third kind			1
@entity95 employee @entity107 tweeted the image on july 26 : ‘ so this evening , over @entity17 , there was a rhombus - shaped cloud ’			1
a spokesman for the @entity95 said the cloud had been formed by a jet engine moving through a pocket of air with the ‘ right conditions ’			1
he said : ‘ this cloud has been formed from the exhaust of a jet engine - known as a contrail			1
‘ in this case an aircraft has moved through a pocket of air with the right conditions for the contrail to form , meaning there is just a short section			0
‘ the wind is blowing across the contrail , and due to the right atmospheric conditions this is causing the ice crystals in that trail to spread outwards - creating this rectangular shaped cloud			1
‘ it ’s unusual to see the cloud edges quite so well - defined as in this example but the processes involved are very common			2

photographer @entity20 captured the image at @entity24 , @entity31
he *compared* the sighting to something from alien movie @entity34
meanwhile an @entity17 resident took a photo of what looks like a flying carpet
but @entity95 said it 's just a rhombus - shaped cloud formed by jet exhaust
