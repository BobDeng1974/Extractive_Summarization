@entity1 chairman @entity0 has admitted he regrets signing @entity2 for a club - record £ 15million			1
and the @entity1 supremo has added to simmering tensions between the board and @entity7 after contradicting his manager ’s comments about @entity10			1
@entity2 is set to miss the next four months after suffering torn ankle ligaments and has flown to @entity12 for surgery			1
it is a huge blow to @entity7 , who was desperate for his striker to stay injury - free next season			1
@entity0 admits that in hindsight , spending big money on @entity2 , 25 , was not a wise move			1
‘ it was desperate last year , we probably made a mistake by putting all our eggs in one basket ( by signing @entity2 ) , ’ he told @entity36			1
‘ had we known what we know now we would n’t have signed the player			0
but it ’s easy to be wise after the event			0
‘ we were assured by our physio — who has since left the club — that the player would be available for the start of the season			2
‘ he was n’t available until january or february			0
a mistake was made and we were given the wrong information			1
‘ we based our decision and our purchase of the player on what the medical department told us			0
we ’ve changed everything in that department as a result of that			0
on his day he is a devastating and fantastic player , we ’ve just got to get him back to his best			0
september 2012misses a month after straining a hamstring against @entity65 december 2012twists his knee against @entity68 and is out for two months @entity69 awkwardly and damages his heel against @entity72 and is out for seven months ‘ but at the same time we ca n’t start the season with the strikeforce we ’ve got			2
i do n’t think it ’s good enough , there ’s not enough height in it and if we get another injury , in terms of quantity , it ’s insufficient , so we have to sign at least one more player			0
’ the club are now pressing ahead with plans to sign a new striker , with @entity88 ’s @entity87 among the names being considered			1
‘ we have to bring in another striker and we ’re working on it now to buy one , or loan one , or both , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ you can never have enough strikers and really with @entity2 gone we have n’t got enough			2
’ meanwhile , the @entity1 board and @entity7 appear to be at odds over @entity10 ’s future			2
he is back at @entity1 following his loan move to @entity100 last season			2
@entity7 , who was close to losing his job this summer , has said he is not part of his plans for next season , but @entity0 has contradicted his manager , saying : ‘ @entity7 has said @entity10 is not part of his plans but we do — as a board — see him as part of our plans			2
‘ i think he said in a press conference , if i read it correctly , he ’s not part of his plans for this season			0
‘ i think he said that in @entity115 but we do n’t agree with that			0
we would like to sit down and give him a longer contract			0
’ ‘ we do like him , we do see him as part of the long - term future of the club but we have to agree it with the manager because there ’s no point signing a player he ’s not going to play			0
’ @entity127 : @entity0 also revealed that @entity1 will now be on the search for a striker thin up top : @entity1 have signed @entity131 ( above ) and @entity132			1
