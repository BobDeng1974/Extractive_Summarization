@entity0 thinks @entity1 are having a lot of bad luck with refereeing decisions and that @entity6 's red card against @entity7 was harsh			1
the @entity9 captain hacked @entity10 with a cynical kick from behind while the @entity7 midfielder was racing away from his own box in the second half			1
however , @entity0 feels the referee should have blown moments earlier for a handball			1
@entity6 was sent off for this foul on @entity7 midfielder @entity10 @entity6 ( centre ) was shown the red card by @entity21 for his cynical foul ' we have n't had much luck with either decision , ' said the @entity1 left back			1
' we have actually had a lot of bad luck , especially with @entity6 's red card as i would say there was a handball before that but the referee did n't stop play			1
' @entity0 , who moved to @entity1 from @entity35 for Â£ 31million this summer , put in a good performance down the left , where he combined well with club record signing @entity39			1
and he added : ' when i started my debut ( for @entity35 ) at @entity41 , i said to myself i want to be playing for the best teams in the best league			0
' i 've done that at the moment and now it 's my chance to keep improving as a player			0
i feel i can do that now			0
' @entity0 gets away from @entity50 on his @entity1 debut @entity0 has had an eventful three months at @entity52			1
shortly after making his competitive @entity9 debut at the @entity54 , @entity0 incurred the wrath of @entity56 for turning up to pre-season out of shape			2
the @entity58 made @entity0 train on his own on the tour of the @entity61 and said : ' @entity0 needs to be fit and he 's not very fit			2
he ca n't perform how i want			0
' however , @entity56 was so impressed with the 19 - year - old 's attitude in training , that he said the teenager was ' an example ' to the rest of his star - studded @entity1 squad			2
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates with @entity69 after the @entity58 put @entity1 2 - 0 up ' for him to say i 'm an example at a massive club like this is something to be really happy about , ' the @entity9 defender said			1
' he was right to say what he said about me in pre-season			0
' we had a discussion then and the plan for me was to get my fitness up			0
it worked , apart from the injury			0
' it was a bit of setback but i 've worked hard in the last weeks and had some talks			0
he 's been a great inspiration to me and hopefully i can carry that on			0
' like our @entity1 facebook page here .			2
