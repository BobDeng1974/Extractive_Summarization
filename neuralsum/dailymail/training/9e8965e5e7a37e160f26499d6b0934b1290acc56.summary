' we 're pretty stoked , ' said @entity9 , an investor in @entity12 's @entity11 , in a 2.30am pt interview			0
' we have n't had any sleep in a long time , but we 're excited for the next step			0
' @entity16 , the state @entity17 's project manager for legal marijuana , said on sunday night that the first two dozen stores were being notified so early in order to give them an extra few hours to get cannabis on their shelves before they are allowed to open their doors at 8am on tuesday – an opening that is expected to be accompanied by high prices , shortages and rationing			1

@entity1 and @entity48 stunned most of the world by voting in november 2012 to legalise marijuana for adults over 21 , and to create state - licensed systems for growing , selling and taxing the pot. sales began in @entity48 on 1 january			1
it remained unclear how many of the pot - shops being licensed in @entity1 planned to open on tuesday			1
officials eventually expect to have more than 300 recreational pot shops across the state			1
at @entity60 , which will be the first and , for now , only recreational marijuana shop in @entity43 , owner @entity33 worked into the night on sunday placing no - parking signs in front of his building , hoisting a grand - opening banner and hanging artwork before he turned his attention to his email – and the official notification that he was a licensed marijuana dealer			1
' i 've had a long day			0
it really has n't sunk in yet , ' he said early on monday			0
he planned to hold off on opening his store until noon on tuesday			2
' know your audience : we 're talking stoners here , ' he said			0
' i 'd be mean to say they need to get up at 5am to get in line			0

as soon as the orders were received , via state - approved software for tracking the bar - coded pot , the growers could place the product in a required 24 - hour ' quarantine ' before shipping it early on tuesday morning			1
the final days before sales have been frenetic for growers and retailers alike			0
@entity33 and his team hired an events company to provide crowd control , arranged for a food truck and free water for those who might spend hours waiting outside , and rented a portable toilet			0
at @entity116 , a marijuana grower in @entity118 , owner @entity115 said he and his director celebrated after they worked through some glitches in the pot - tracking software early on monday and officially learned they would be able to transport their weed 24 hours later , at 2.22am on tuesday			2

' it 's huge for us			0
' pot prices were expected to reach $ 25 a gram or higher on the first day of sales – twice what people pay in the state 's unregulated medical marijuana dispensaries			1
that was largely due to the short supply of legally produced pot in the state			2
although more than 2,600 people applied to become licensed growers , fewer than 100 have been approved – and only about a dozen were ready to harvest by early this month			0
nevertheless , @entity9 said his shop in @entity12 wanted to thank the state 's residents for voting for the law by offering $ 10 grams of one cannabis strain to the first 50 or 100 customers			2
the other strains would be priced between $ 12 and $ 25 , he said			0
in @entity43 , among those who planned to buy some of the first pot at @entity60 was @entity163 , the lawyer who drafted @entity1 's law			1
she said it was a good opportunity to remind people of the big - picture arguments for ending nearly a century of prohibition and displacing the black market , including keeping non-violent , adult marijuana users out of jail ; redirecting profits away from criminal groups ; and ending racial disparities in who gets busted			2
' no one thought legalisation could happen in our lifetime , ' she said			0
' i think this is going to be a little overwhelming for me			0
