this reindeer is clearly not feeling the @entity2 spirit			0
and as luck would have it , it 's even called @entity6 ! captured on @entity8 , the reindeer is caught in the act of destroying @entity11 's sleigh at a wildlife park in @entity13			1
the naughty reindeer uses its antlers to rip the side off @entity18 's @entity2 's sleigh the footage , shot on a webcam at @entity21 on sunday , shows @entity6 playfully attacking the decorative sleigh put in his paddock			1
the webcam ' captured @entity6 , the red - nosed reindeer red - handed while demolishing @entity11 's sleigh			1
no presents for @entity6 this year ! ' the filmer later wrote online			0
as other reindeer relax nearby , one ca n't help itself in inspecting @entity11 's sleigh fresh after destroying the sleigh , that appears to have gifts inside , the reindeer scarpers the animal begins by carefully checking out the sleigh , before fronting up and bending down			2
then with a quick movement , it uses its antlers to rip the side off the gift - giver , before scarpering along with other reindeer in the park			0
usually it 's naughty children who @entity2 decides will miss out on gifts at @entity2			0
but as well as being under threat of being sacked as chief sleigh - puller , this pesky @entity6 will be off @entity2 's present list this year .			2
