@entity1 's disgraced ex-president @entity0 could be freed as early as today following a court ruling that jolted a nation already in turmoil today			1
convening yesterday at the @entity8 jail where @entity0 is held , the court ordered the release of the military man who ruled @entity1 for 30 years until he was overthrown during the uprisings that swept the @entity13 world in early 2011			1
news of the ruling came as the @entity16 decided to suspend exports of weapons and goods to @entity1 , but stopped short of halting aid programmes for fear of hurting ordinary @entity1 already suffering			1
@entity0 , 85 , was sentenced to life in prison last year for failing to prevent the killing of demonstrators			0
but a court accepted his appeal earlier this year and ordered a retrial			0
the ailing ex-president probably has no political future , but some predicted ' public outrage ' in the wake of the court ruling , which state prosecutor @entity51 said can not be appealed			1
' the army has brought back @entity0 's regime , the same regime , ' said @entity54 , outside a bicycle shop in central @entity8			2
' those who were elected by the people are now in prison			0
' he was referring to a widescale security sweep on @entity61 's @entity35 that has netted many of its leaders			2
the 28 @entity16 foreign ministers have called on the military authorities and the supporters of deposed president @entity61 's @entity35 movement to resume negotiations to avoid further bloodshed			1
unrest : sit - ins staged in support of the ousted @entity35 are being forcibly dispersed by military - backed authorities in @entity1 anger : supporters of @entity1 's ousted president @entity61 , seen with posters that read ' yes to legitimacy , no to the coup ' in @entity79 , are seen marching in @entity8 on monday ' it was decided ... to suspend all arms deliveries that can be used internally , ' said @entity83 foreign minister @entity82 following the emergency meeting in @entity85			1
' we have decided to maintain our aid for the @entity1 population because it already suffers enormously , ' he added			2
clashes between @entity1 security forces and @entity61 's supporters have killed hundreds of people since last week			1
' we do believe that the recent operations of the security forces have been disproportionate and we 're worried about the resulting alarming number of people that have been killed , ' said the @entity16 's foreign policy chief @entity97			1
political turbulence has kept @entity1 on edge for months			2
at least 900 people , including 100 soldiers and police , have been killed in a crackdown on @entity61 supporters in the past week , making it the country 's bloodiest internal episode in decades			2
the @entity107 and the @entity16 have both been reviewing aid to @entity8 in light of the bloodshed , but @entity111 , a foe of the @entity35 , has promised to make up any shortfall			1
there was no immediate reaction to the ruling on @entity117 , whose leaders are mostly behind bars			0
@entity0 is still being retried on charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during the revolt against him , but he has already served the maximum pre-trial detention in that case			0
the court ruling removed the last legal ground for his imprisonment in connection with a corruption case , following a similar decision in another corruption case on monday			0
@entity0 will not be allowed to leave @entity1 and his assets remain frozen			0
@entity0 's two sons , @entity138 and @entity139 , along with former interior minister @entity140 , are still in prison , and @entity140 's lawyer said the ruling on @entity0 had no bearing on their cases			0
some of the liberal and secular politicians who backed the army 's ousting of @entity61 , @entity1 's first freely elected president , on july 3 , said they regretted the hated @entity0 's release , but argued that the judiciary 's decision should be respected			1
response : @entity154 interrupted his vacation to announce that a planned joint military exercise with @entity1 would not go ahead in light of the escalating crisis ' his regime was lousy and he destroyed the country , ' said @entity161 , head of the @entity162 , to which the army - appointed interim prime minister belongs			1
noting @entity0 's age and the jail time he has served , he said : ' we should focus on building the country , establishing democracy and finishing the problem of the @entity35			0
' the government knows that if @entity0 is freed there will be public outrage , but a court decision is a court decision			1
' @entity176 , spokesman of the liberal @entity177 , said the trials of the ex-president and his associates had all been flawed because the judiciary was ill - equipped to deal with cases related to @entity0 's rule , resulting in a series of acquittals			0
' it was a faulty process from the beginning , ' he said			0
the relatively muted response from @entity0 's @entity190 opponents may reflect a reluctance to rock the boat following the army 's removal of @entity61 , which they had endorsed			2
the generals say they were responding to the will of the people after vast demonstrations organised by liberals and leftists demanding @entity61 's ousting			0
they have installed an interim administration to oversee a roadmap back to democracy			0
hundreds of people - including 70 policemen and soldiers - have been killed in @entity1 since the military - backed government forcibly dispersed sit - ins supporting the ousted @entity35 in @entity8 a week ago			1
the resulting massacre saw president @entity154 interrupt his holiday in @entity212 to declare that his government would not hold a planned joint military exercise with @entity1 forces next month			1
but @entity154 remained silent on the question of whether the billions of dollars in foreign aid sent to @entity1 from the @entity107 each year will continue in spite of the ongoing bloodshed			1
the @entity16 and its member states last year pledged a combined 5 billion euros ( $ 6.7 billion ) in loans and aid for @entity1			1
diplomats from several @entity16 countries cautioned that a decision to halt all aid programs was unlikely since many are directed at helping the poor or propping up civil society groups - not directly supporting the government			2
moreover , @entity16 threats to cut some aid may not frighten @entity1 's leadership since @entity111 - a long - time critic of the @entity35 - has pledged to plug any shortfall			1
@entity111 and other wealthy @entity236 nations , including @entity237 and the @entity238 , have so far promised $ 12 billion in new aid			2
a suspension of @entity16 arms shipments seemed more likely			0
' i would assume that no one would export arms in this situation , ' @entity243 foreign minister @entity242 said on his way into the meeting			0
the islamists arrested in @entity1 yesterday include a preacher known for his fiery sermons at @entity35 gatherings , who was reportedly caught as he tried to flee to neighbouring @entity255 in disguise , and a spokesman for the movement said to have been en route to catch a flight out of the country			0
crackdown : @entity1 authorities have already detained @entity263 , the @entity35 's supreme leader and spiritual guide tensions : @entity1 soldiers stood guard at a military checkpoint during a dusk - to - dawn curfew in @entity8 strife : @entity1 soldiers stand guard beside a tank at a military checkpoint in @entity8 , as the crackdown on @entity35 figures continues they are the latest allies of president @entity61 , who hails from the @entity35 , to be arrested			1
this week , authorities detained the @entity35 's supreme leader and spiritual guide , @entity263 , dealing a serious blow to an embattled movement now struggling to keep up its protest campaign against the military 's overthrow of @entity61 and subsequent deadly assaults on @entity288 sit - ins			2
a court ruling earlier in the week raised the possibility that @entity0 could walk free , a move that would fuel the unrest roiling the country after the autocratic leader 's successor was removed in a military coup			2
@entity0 , in detention since april 2011 , was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year for failing to stop the killing of some 900 protesters in @entity1 's 2011 uprising			0
his sentence was overturned on appeal and he is now being retried , along with his security chief and six top police commanders			0
he is facing a number of other corruption charges .			0
