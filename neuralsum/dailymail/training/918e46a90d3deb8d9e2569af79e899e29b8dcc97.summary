mr @entity39 , who works for a glasses company , said : ' we 'd originally booked with @entity42 but their flight was overbooked so they put us on a @entity37 plane instead			0
' we got to @entity8 just before 1am , went to the baggage reclaim hall and sat and waited for our suitcases to come on the carousel			1
we waited and waited and eventually they came out at 4am			1
' according to mr @entity39 there were around 100 other passengers in the same position , many with young children			0
mr @entity56 asked if his family could leave the airport and return later , but the airport staff said no ' @entity33 's nappy needed changing but we did n't have any spare nappies in our bags so could n't change her , ' he said			2
' we kept asking the airport staff what the delay was and all they 'd tell us was that it was due to only having three baggage handlers on duty			2
' but a @entity42 flight arrived from @entity71 while we were waiting and they all got their suitcases straight away			2
' mr @entity56 explained that they asked if they could go away and pick up their bags later and were told no. ' she told us we could n't leave the airport without our suitcases so we were stranded there all night even though we only live five minutes away , ' he said			2
' in that time , we did n't get offered so much as a glass of water			0
