rangers have problems that run much deeper than a @entity3 defeat to a team from the same division			1
but there was something about sunday 's loss to @entity9 — exactly the kind of side you do n’t want encounter in the middle of a crisis — that felt particularly damning			2
this was @entity9 ’s first win against @entity0 at @entity19 since 1959 , when a lad by the name of @entity22 scored in their 3 - 2 triumph			1
if none of the current @entity9 squad appears destined to achieve the same kind of mythical status as @entity29 , the same — and more — could be said of the hopeless bunch now representing the ‘ other ’ club he went on to serve with such elegant ease			2
@entity34 ( left ) was on hand to slam home the loose ball and send @entity9 into the quarter - finals @entity34 peels away to celebrate scoring the winner against @entity0 in the @entity41 tie @entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) : @entity42 5 ; @entity43 5 , @entity44 5 ( @entity45 , 43 ) , @entity46 4 , @entity47 5 ; law 5 , @entity49 5 , @entity50 ( @entity51 , 74 ) ; @entity52 6 ; @entity54 6 ( @entity53 , 64 ) subs not used : @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58			1

subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 booked : @entity79 goals : @entity69 54 , @entity34 75 man of the match : @entity66 referee : @entity84 attendance : 11,422 whoever would have thought @entity87 was being kind when he branded this lot the worst @entity0 team in history ? they would have to improve to be mediocre			1
they are hanging on to miserable by their fingertips			0
@entity9 won this game , securing themselves a place in today ’s quarter - final draw , with something to spare			1
in @entity66 , they had the best player on the park , while @entity34 spent the entire afternoon buying time and space for his team - mates , holding the ball up and bringing others into play			1
a beautiful @entity69 free - kick and a @entity34 tap - in — following another horrible howler involving @entity0 keeper @entity42 and his defenders — came either side of a debut goal from @entity60 , who at least justified his inclusion in the team			1
which is more than could be said for some of his more established team - mates			0
seriously , @entity118 ? if there is an example of a player ’s career going from zenith to nadir in a more spectacular fashion , somebody should turn it into a book			0
misery memoirs are always best sellers			0
the only time he earned a cheer was when the board went up for his substitution			0
@entity69 had given @entity9 a shock lead at @entity19 after curling in a 20 - yard free - kick @entity0 goalkeeper @entity42 watches the ball fly into the net from @entity69 's free kick @entity69 celebrates with his @entity9 team - mates after opening the scoring at @entity19 even then , he was immediately booed for appearing to dawdle off the park			1
it ’s hard to see a way back for him now the fans have so unanimously turned against him			0
the way things are going at @entity0 , of course , he and some of his under - performing team - mates could soon lose their places to a five - a - side unit of new loan signings , the first two of whom began their controversial @entity19 careers yesterday			2
the order to field all fit on - loan @entity160 players saw centre - half @entity161 replace @entity45 , while @entity163 lost his place on the wing to @entity60			1
@entity161 limped off injured just before half - time			1
but the 20 - year - old did a few decent things in his 43 minutes on the park			0
@entity60 got his goal and showed promise in flashes			2
to say he was one of the better @entity0 players on the day may damn him with faint praise but , given time and a guaranteed run in the team , he should improve			0
as for what the imposition of him and his @entity160 mates does to the rest of the team , well , the early signs are not good			2
on loan @entity160 playmaker @entity60 scores on his @entity0 debut to level the scoreline at 1 - 1 @entity60 celebrates with his team - mates but his joy was to be short - lived as the home side crashed out fans who had gathered for a muted protest before the game — their impact deadened by the @entity196 brothers and chief executive @entity197 staying away — clearly do n’t like anything spawned by the partnership between the current board and @entity160 owner @entity201			1
there was widespread applause when a group of fans unfurled a banner showing a trainer stamping on two rats with pound signs in their eyes , one representing @entity212 ’s buses , the other @entity213			0
there was n’t much else for the home crowd to cheer in a first half that saw @entity217 come closer to scoring than their hosts			0
@entity63 thought he had broken the deadlock when his glancing header from a @entity69 corner went fizzing towards the back post — only to strike the upright and bounce straight into the grateful arms of @entity42			2
that was a let - off for @entity0 , who looked bogged down in midfield , sluggish up front and far too open to the counter-attack and could not complain about being booed off at half - time			2
@entity9 ? with @entity66 a genuine threat on the flank , @entity68 adding energy to midfield and the redoubtable @entity64 leading the back line , they looked comfortable			2
@entity0 fans protest against the board outside the ground before their game with @entity9 @entity241 striker @entity52 advances forward with the ball and is chased by @entity9 ' @entity243 at @entity19 @entity9 defender @entity64 slides in to tackle @entity0 goalscorer @entity60 the second half began with @entity34 robbing the hapless @entity118 before charging into the box and setting up a decent spell of pressure			1
they took the lead with 54 minutes gone , @entity69 curling and dipping his left - footed free - kick over the wall and inside the post , a just punishment for @entity49 diving in illegally to prevent @entity67 getting a shot on target from the edge of the box			1
when @entity60 equalised eight minutes later , well , there once was a time when that would have been the signal for a @entity0 onslaught			0
instead , it was @entity9 who grew stronger			0
the visitors stretched the opposition defence with surging runs and daring dashes			0
one of which produced the winner			0
@entity66 was again involved , driving down the right wing and laying the ball off to captain @entity62 , whose fiery low cross should have been held by @entity42 — but was spilled under pressure from @entity9 sub @entity71 and at least two home defenders			0
@entity34 charged in to bury the loose ball			0
@entity0 deserved the chorus of boos and insults flung in their direction as they traipsed off the field , victims of a defeat that — given the ‘ upsets ’ suffered by the @entity19 club in recent seasons — qualifies as a @entity3 shock only on a technicality			1
rovers defender @entity62 works had to shield the ball from @entity0 ' @entity292 @entity0 forward @entity54 loses his man to head towards goal during the match against @entity9 @entity60 was once tipped as one of @entity299 football 's brightest prospects before seeing his career stall			1

rangers were knocked out of the @entity3 after a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity19
@entity160 loanees @entity60 and @entity161 made their @entity241 debuts
@entity161 had to be substituted through injury during the first - half
@entity69 gave @entity9 the lead , before @entity60 hit an equaliser
but @entity34 secured an upset with a 75th minute winner
