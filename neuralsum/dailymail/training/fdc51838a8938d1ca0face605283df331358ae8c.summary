by @entity0 a @entity2 - winning photographer has been fired by the @entity4 news agency after admitting he had doctored one of his photos from the @entity8 civil war			1
the photographer , @entity10 had manipulated a photo of a @entity8 rebel by using a common @entity14 technique called ' cloning ' in order to remove a fellow reporter 's camera out of the picture , before sending it to an @entity4 photo desk			1
the technique involves copying another piece of the photo and moving it to another area , giving photographers the ability to erase portions of pictures			1
in this case it was a colleague 's camera			0
spot the difference : in the original image ( top photo ) , a fellow journalist 's video camera is visible on the ground in the left corner of the frame			1
freelance photographer @entity10 altered the image ( lower photo ) by cloning another part of the background , before sending it to an @entity4 photo desk @entity4 does allow its photographers to use software to lighten or darken photographs , what they call ' minor adjustments ' , but according to its ethics policy , only these small types of changes are acceptable			1
@entity10 , who shared a @entity2 for his images of the war , said that the photo was the only one he has manipulated			1
he said : ' i took the wrong decision when i removed the camera			0
i feel ashamed about that			0
' you can go through my archives and you can find that this is a single case that happened probably at one very stressed moment , at one very difficult situation			0
' but it happened to me , so i have to assume the consequences			1
' the @entity4 has since cut ties with the award - winning photographer , whose work has been featured in publications across the world , such as the @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , and the @entity79			1
@entity10 has been working for @entity4 to cover the conflict since before 2012 and has had many photographs reach critical acclaim , such as this picture of a rebel sniper aiming at a @entity8 army position in the @entity87 district of @entity88 @entity10 won awards for his photographs which provided an insight into both the war 's impact on civilians ( left ) and soldiers in the conflict			1
residents walk past damaged buildings ( right ) due to heavy fighting between @entity100 fighters and government forces in @entity88 , @entity8 , in a picture taken in october 2012 @entity10 , the @entity103 photojournalist during his time working for @entity105 in 2011			0
he is lying down resting on a gurney inside a hospital after he was reportedly beaten by @entity110 police in @entity111 , the summer capital of @entity110 administered @entity113 , @entity110 since the revelation , @entity4 has examined 494 photos taken by @entity10 , but did not find any other alterations			2
this is not the first time that @entity4 has had to pull photographs because of digital manipulation			2
in 2011 , they pulled an entire series because a photographer used editing software to remove his shadow from an image			2
@entity127 , @entity4 's vice president and director of photography , said : ' @entity131 € ™ s reputation is paramount and we react decisively and vigorously when it is tarnished by actions in violation of our ethics code			2
speaking about @entity10 , @entity127 said : ' deliberately removing elements from our photographs is completely unacceptable and we have severed all relations with the freelance photographer in question			0
' he will not work for the @entity4 again in any capacity			2
' another high profile case of camera trickery involving the @entity8 war happened earlier this month with an arranged photograph which had both nothing to do with the @entity8 civil war , or any grounding in truth			1
a photo taken by @entity151 in @entity152 went viral on the internet , floating around with the caption ' @entity8 orphan sleeping between his parents '			0
photographer @entity158 has since said he was shocked by how the picture had been ' twisted ' , because he made it very clear it was not real when he posted it on @entity163			0
( @entity165 ) the photo was not doctored , but was misconstrued when it went viral on the internet , with people claiming it was a @entity8 child ' sleeping between his parents '			0
( @entity171 ) a later photo revealed the first as a staged statement rather than a piece of photojournalism , taken in @entity152			0
