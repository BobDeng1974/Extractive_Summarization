@entity60 : @entity3 from @entity46 , @entity47 , who converted to @entity50 age 17 , was married to @entity51 before he blew himself up in the july 7 terror attacks in @entity53 in 2005 , killing 26 now it is suspected that she was the mastermind behind the four - day gun and bomb attack on @entity65 in @entity66 , which has led to a continuing siege in which more than 60 people have lost their lives			1

mr @entity80 recalled a meeting with @entity3 and @entity106 regarding a housing issue which took place three or four weeks before the july 7 bombings , and he said she was just as he remembered her			1
' certainly when i was around her , she was the same person , lacking in confidence			0
' she was not strong - headed			2
and that ’s why i find it absolutely amazing that she is supposed to be the head of an international criminal terrorist organisation , ' he said			0
mr @entity80 said he was ' perplexed ' that someone he knew , who was so ' empty in confidence ' , was being linked to international terrorism			0
he said he prays that she is not involved , adding : ' ... and of course my worry is that if she in involved , is she under some kind of duress ? is there other factors involved ? ' or indeed , is it @entity3 ? i mean there are so many questions to be answered at the moment before one can make a view			1
' mr @entity80 said her family will be ' very upset ' if she is involved			0
' of course like anyone else , they will be very hurt , very upset , very , very upset , but i think they too will be waiting for proof , not speculation , ' he said			0
suspicion that @entity3 was in the attack in @entity66 were raised after the @entity7 foreign minister claimed that a @entity1 woman who has has allegedly been involved in terrorism ' many times before ' was among the militants			1
the @entity46 home of @entity70 , @entity3 's father : @entity3 was still at primary school when her family moved from @entity22 , @entity73 to to @entity46 in @entity47 @entity150 said the woman acted alongside ' two or three ' @entity152 as security forces began a fourth day of fighting at the shopping centre where at least six @entity1 are known to have died			1
a @entity1 policeman has testified in @entity7 in the trial of a @entity157 accused of plotting attacks and who has ties to @entity161 , the @entity162 group behind a weekend attack on the shopping mall			1
@entity165 ( pictured below today in court ) , of @entity53 , was arrested in december 2011 in a raid by @entity7 anti-terrorism police on his apartment in the @entity7 port city of @entity171 , along with a female accomplice , @entity172 , who police said was his wife			0
police said a third suspect , believed to be @entity3 , escaped in that raid			1

@entity186 , a detective constable with @entity188 police , working in the forensic management team under the counter-terrorism command , told the court he had been part of a team deployed to assist @entity7 police			0
mr @entity186 said he and his team were told by @entity7 police that ‘ they were looking at a plot to detonate explosives in parts of @entity7			0
’ he said he had been informed that a @entity157 , @entity165 , had been arrested using a false @entity201 identity			0
the detectives were led to a government laboratory where they were conducting tests on chemicals recovered from @entity165 's apartment , mr @entity186 said			2
mr @entity186 , a bomb scene examiner , manager and counter-terrorism investigator , said the kind of chemicals found , if mixed for a short time , could make explosives that ‘ could detonate easily when exposed to shock or flame			0
’ earlier this month , @entity165 was acquitted by a @entity66 court of robbery with violence , charges that could have carried the death penalty , but remained in custody because of the trial in @entity171			0
prosecutor @entity221 said three detectives from @entity188 were among his witnesses			0
however there was confusion over ms @entity150 ’s comments - made while attending the @entity227 in @entity228 - with no confirmation either from the authorities in @entity66 or the @entity231 in @entity53			2
they directly contradict the @entity7 interior minister @entity233 who yesterday told a news conference that all the attackers were male - although he suggested that some may have been dressed as women			1
the @entity231 said only that it was aware of the foreign minister ’s comments			0
' we continue to liaise very closely with the @entity7 authorities and to support their investigation into this attack , ' a spokesman said			0
after her husband @entity106 detonated his suicide bomb at on a @entity249 line tube train between @entity251 and @entity252 stations in 2005 , @entity3 had told how she was horrified by the massacre			2
but the @entity254 - born @entity103 convert , who grew up in @entity256 , @entity257 , had never made a secret of his extremist views , alarming teachers by attempting to radicalise younger pupils			2
in 2009 @entity3 disappeared with her three children but resurfaced two years later after travelling to @entity7 on a false passport			2
the @entity7 authorities issued a photograph of a white woman in a veil who they said was wanted for questioning about a bomb factory in the coastal resort of @entity171			0
it is understood she has had little contact with relatives in @entity73 since her conversion to @entity50			0
mr @entity80 said he does not think the speculation surrounding @entity3 will cause divisions in @entity46 due to the community ’s maturity			1
' of course if it is @entity3 indeed , of course they ’ll be very hurt , very upset , as indeed any human being would be , but in terms of causing any differences in our community i think the community is far more mature for that kind of thing , ' he said			2
@entity292 , who was until recently the @entity294 's @entity293 , told @entity295 that any role @entity3 has with @entity8 militant group @entity161 is unclear			1
he said : ‘ @entity3 has obviously been involved in terrorism or connected with terrorists for some considerable time now			2
her role in @entity161 is very unclear or even if she has a role within ( it )			0
‘ she is currently wanted by the @entity7 authorities in relation to an investigation for those who have committed acts of terrorism			0
but as yet she is untried and unconvicted for those offences			0
‘ traditionally she would be seen to be somebody as a sympathiser , a facilitator or an instigator of terrorism			0
‘ she has certainly got a large media profile , certainly in the @entity1 media press in relation to her activities and her involvement in terrorist activities is still yet to be proven , but as i said she is still wanted for terrorist offences			2
