by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 has been the surprise star of @entity5 ’s pre-season preparations			1
the 18 - year - old scored one and created another during the @entity9 ’ 3 - 1 victory over @entity11 on sunday			1
he had terrorised his @entity13 opponents throughout and won praise from manager @entity15 after the game			1
so who is the teenage talent ? @entity19 was at the @entity20 this weekend and here we fill you in on the boy who could emerge as a new @entity25 favourite this season			2
in a nutshell , who is he ? @entity2 was born in @entity29 in @entity30 but moved to the @entity31 as a child			2
he was snapped up by @entity34 ’s academy but @entity5 were soon aware of his potential and brought him to @entity36 as a 16 - year - old			2
he scored a goal and created another against @entity11 , sounds like an attacking player ? that he most certainly is			1
a left - footed left - winger – yes , they do still exist – @entity2 is all about the offensive			2
he has a low centre of gravity , the ability to wriggle between opponents and is a robust sort who looks like he ’ll bounce back from any meaty treatment served upon him			0
tell us more about his performance this weekend ? he was bright in the 3 - 1 defeat against @entity60 on saturday but took centre stage against the hosts 24 hours later			0
on 10 minutes he turned his full back inside and out before landing an enticing centre onto the forehead of @entity66 , who did the rest with a smart finish			0
his goal arrived after the break and , while a little fortuitous , it was well deserved			0
he escaped two blue shirts down the left flank before sweeping a cross-cum - shot to the far post where it sailed over the head of the goalkeeper before creeping into the side - netting			0
he later told manager @entity15 it was intended , however			2
goalscorer : @entity2 celebrates after scoring against @entity11 in @entity5 's pre-season win in @entity81 does he remind you of anyone ? @entity30 - born left - winger who qualifies to play for @entity86 ... a certain @entity84 springs to mind but so , too , does @entity87			1
@entity2 boasts all of the same attributes as the the @entity90 star and is strikingly similar in build and style			1
he does say that his favourite player is @entity94 , his @entity5 team - mate who @entity15 has cast aside after questioning his professionalism			1
perhaps the manager would be happier if he found a new role model			0
similar style : @entity2 will be hoping he can follow @entity87 in becoming a @entity100 star has he played for the first - team before ? not in a competitive match			1
he has progressed through the club ’s youth and reserve teams during the past two seasons but is expected to make that step up this time around			0
and at international level ? it ’s perhaps a little too early for that , but given his dual nationality we dare say the @entity113 have taken note			0
what does his manager say about him ? ‘ @entity2 ’s the sort of player the fans will love – he ’s obviously very quick , ’ @entity15 has said previously			1
‘ he plays left side and gets crosses in , which is something we have n’t got in the group			0
he enjoys playing that role			0
‘ we ’ve had a couple of left - footed players who do n’t actually like playing that side , but he has the pace to trouble any full back			0
’ after the game against @entity11 , @entity15 told us : ‘ the real highlight of pre-season has been @entity2 and he was terrific again			1
‘ it ’s nice to see a young player really pushing and i thought he caused real problems for @entity11 – long may that continue			2
’ long may that continue indeed , we ’re certainly hoping he is given a chance to shine this season			0
full of praise : @entity5 boss @entity15 has been impressed by the form of @entity2 @entity5 have greater attacking external video threat - @entity15			1

the @entity5 youngster scored against @entity11 on sunday
@entity2 is similar to @entity90 's @entity87
@entity15 has been delighted with @entity2 ' form during pre-season
