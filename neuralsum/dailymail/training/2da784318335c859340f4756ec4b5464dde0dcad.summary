by @entity0 last updated at 2:04 pm on 1st november 2011 the @entity1 has reintroduced its plan for minimum alcohol pricing			1
the @entity5 administration had been blocked by opposition parties when it tried to set a floor price per unit last year but now has a majority in the @entity9			1
health secretary @entity10 said it was time @entity13 's ' unhealthy relationship with alcohol ' was tackled			1
booze @entity15 : the chairman of the @entity17 in @entity13 said it is wrong that alcohol is sold at prices cheaper than fizzy drinks however critics , including some drinks industry bodies , say the move will penalise responsible drinkers and will encourage people to go on cheap ' booze - runs ' across the border to towns like @entity29 and @entity30			1
last year the price was expected to be set at 45p per unit but no official limit has yet been set			1
an own - brand bottle of vodka increasing in price from from £ 8.35 to £ 11.85 a two - litre bottle of cider going up from £ 1.20 to £ 3.75 and the cost of a bottle of wine moving from £ 3.75 to £ 4.20 the policy has been widely supported by police and health professionals			1
the @entity46 group has changed its position and is likely to support the government too			0
ms @entity10 said : ' we should not lose sight of what has been achieved during the last four years			0
we have had a wide - ranging debate on alcohol pricing and there is now widespread recognition across the country of the need to tackle pricing			1
' we have introduced a ban on quantity discounts and promotions in off - sales have been restricted , but already we have seen that without minimum pricing these attempts to take action on @entity13 's alcohol problem are being undermined			1
' by setting a minimum price for a unit of alcohol , we can raise the price of the cheap supermarket white ciders , lager and value spirits sought out by problem drinkers			2
booze cruise : drinkers could hop over the border to towns like @entity29 , @entity80 , pictured , to buy cheaper alcohol ' i hope that this time around @entity83 will do the right thing and back this policy that has the support of doctors , nurses , the police and growing numbers of the general population			2
' dr @entity92 , chairman of the @entity17 in @entity13 , said it was wrong that alcohol is sold at prices cheaper than fizzy drinks			1
health secretary @entity10 said @entity13 's unhealthy relationship with alcohol must be tackled he said : ' without addressing price , many of the policies we 've introduced already will be rendered less effective			1
' there is an urgent need to legislate			0
for too long supermarkets have been piling it high , selling it cheap when it comes to alcohol			2
' these retailers are already working on how to navigate the loopholes of the new laws on drinks promotions and it is clear that , by encouraging bulk - buying at low prices , these retailers are placing profit before public health			0
' but @entity118 , chief executive of the @entity119 , said the move means the majority of responsible drinkers will be punished by higher prices			0
he said there was no evidence minimum pricing will address the problem and the most recent @entity1 figures show alcohol consumption per capita fell in @entity13 last year			1
mr @entity118 added : ' the @entity9 should insist on its right to review the policy and its impact on cross-border shopping , internet sales of alcohol and any evidence of illegal trade of alcohol in @entity13			1
' the government argues that alcohol - related problems cost @entity13 £ 3.56 billion each year , equal to £ 900 for every adult			1
last year , @entity83 did approve a ban on discount deals , such as two - for - one bottles of wine , and restricted ' irresponsible ' drinks promotions and advertising around premises			2
price rise : the changes could mean an own - brand bottle of vodka increasing from £ 8.35 to £ 11.85 and a two - litre bottle of cider going up from £ 1.20 to £ 3.75 the @entity155 established a requirement for age verification and paved the way for a new tax on licence holders , called a social responsibility levy			2
the tax aims to ensure retailers and licensed premises , such as nightclubs , contribute to the wider cost of their activities to the community			2
the @entity5 pledged to push ahead with the alcohol price plan in its election manifesto			2
the party was elected with an unprecedented majority in may this year			0
@entity172 , chief executive of the @entity173 , said minimum pricing was the wrong option			0
he highlighted comments made last week by @entity178 's @entity177 , @entity179 , who said the plan is ' probably illegal ' under @entity182 free trade rules			0
@entity184 public health spokesman dr @entity183 said his party is still opposed to the policy and questioned whether the plan is legal			0
meanwhile , a leading academic on the alcohol industry and the chief executive of a brewery have backed the @entity1 's plans to introduce minimum pricing			0
professor @entity192 , director of the @entity193 of @entity194 , said there is clear evidence that minimum pricing in @entity198 has significantly reduced alcohol consumption			0
however , @entity200 , chief executive of brewer @entity201 , which runs more than 2,000 pubs , restaurants and hotels in the @entity15 , believes minimum pricing would ' go to the very heart ' of the problems associated with excessive drinking			0
@entity46 leader @entity46 said : ' cutting alcohol abuse is essential if we are to help people get on in the world			0
too many @entity13 do n't achieve all they can because they drink too much			1
minimum pricing will help with this effort			0

alcohol problems cost @entity13 £ 3.56bn per year
