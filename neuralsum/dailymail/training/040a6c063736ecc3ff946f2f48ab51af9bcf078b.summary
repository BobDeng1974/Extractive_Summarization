for years the world has watched her cuddle a chimpanzee , swing on an elephant 's trunk and gently stroke camels through a series of stunning photos by her mother			1
and although she is now aged 15 and has developed other interests , @entity11 , from @entity12 , insists she has no plans to stop posing with animals			1
' there ’s nothing stopping us , ’ the 10th grader told the @entity19			2
‘ i ’m just going to keep playing it out till the end			2
' my mother and mother - in - law died quite close to each other and it knocked me for six , ' said @entity23			2
' after that though , i realised that it was so important to spend time with my daughter			2
' so we came to the understanding that if she was to come with me on my photographic work our deal would be that the only times i would take pictures of her would be when she was with animals			1
' she loves them , she is so natural with them			0
' she is a shy girl , but can have more confidence with a giraffe , or a chimpanzee than a fully grown man or woman could have with another person			0
' we spend time most summers attending fairs and meeting contacts in the animal community , where @entity11 can come close to elephants like @entity71 , who simply picked her up with her trunk			1
her adventures began at the age of three when her photographer mother @entity75 took her along with her as she went to work at private homes and game parks now 15 , @entity11 has started putting her own print on the photos , such as styling the costumes the teen says she feels more comfortable around animals than she does people ' that was a magical moment for me and @entity11			1
it really was like @entity11 was talking to @entity87 , just like you would with a person			1
' while their adventures has already produced one book , @entity94 , the @entity95 is trying to raise funds on @entity97 for another that encompasses the whole journey , to be called @entity11 and the animals			1
' since i was only three , it seemed sort of normal just to know monkeys and a lot of different animals , ' @entity11 says in the @entity97 video , ' until i got older and i realized that was n’t something that most kids had the opportunity to do			1
' @entity23 told the @entity19 that she thinks her daughter has grown alongside the portraits			0
the unusual photographs have been compiled into a book called @entity116 while their adventures has already produced one book , @entity94 , the @entity95 is trying to raise funds on @entity97 for another that encompasses the whole journey , to be called @entity11 and the animals @entity11 is totally at ease with the animals and has developed a deep affinity with them ‘ i think @entity11 is very conscious of what she ’s doing , ’ she says			1
‘ in 2010 i felt her interest was waning so i asked her what she wanted , and she said more primates			0
' so i networked to find her primates			0
’ but although she loves animals she has no plans to follow her mother 's career			2
‘ i want to go into science , ’ she told the newspaper ‘ but i do n’t think the distinction between science and art is that clear cut			0
in maths our last project was constructions			0
we went to church and chose stained - glass windows to reconstruct			0
our final project was drawings we had to colour and paint , but we had to figure out the proportions without using a ruler			0
' that ’s just one example of how connected art is with maths			0
’ a photo of @entity11 when she was a child cuddling up to a primate			1

@entity11 , 15 , of @entity12 , has been posing for photos with exotic animals since she was three
some 12 years worth of pictures collated into a book called @entity11 and the animals
