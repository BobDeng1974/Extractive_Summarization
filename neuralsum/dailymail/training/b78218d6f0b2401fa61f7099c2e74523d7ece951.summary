it is easy to pick on @entity1			1
he is not blessed with pace , he ’s not a big player and he comes across as a quiet , humble guy			2
but you can not argue with what he produces on the pitch			2
he came off the bench to save @entity10 against @entity11 and he must be wondering what more he has to do to play regular football at @entity14			1
@entity1 ( right ) hits the ball through a crowd of @entity11 players to score @entity10 's winner @entity1 celebrates his goal , just minutes after he came on as a substitute the @entity21 readies himself to replace @entity22 but @entity1 is better then being a super sub at @entity10 11 - @entity1 has been involved in 11 goals in his last 15 @entity26 games for @entity10			1
he has scored nine and set up two			0
there is no doubting his quality — this is a player with a @entity31 and @entity32 to his name			0
but he found himself surplus to requirements at @entity36 and now seems to be in a similar position at @entity10			1
you have to credit him because he never causes a fuss or has a bad word to say			0
he wants to play football			2
he is too good to be a super sub at @entity10 and if he does n’t get some more action , i could see him moving on or maybe even back to @entity46			1
@entity47 's in dreamland every weekend people up and down the country wake up and dream of playing football in the @entity53			1
that ’s why @entity55 ’s is such a great story			1
five years ago he was playing non-league football for @entity58			2
now he is rubbing shoulders with the likes of @entity61			0
he looks like he ’s loving each second in the @entity53 and he deserves every bit of it			1
@entity55 does a chicken dance - part of a dare organised by @entity66 - after his goal on saturday the @entity69 striker slides the ball under @entity71 to make it 1 - 0 and carry on his good recent form 12 - @entity61 ( @entity74 ) 10 - @entity75 ( @entity36 ) 8 - @entity76 ( @entity77 ) 7 - @entity78 ( @entity79 ) 6 - @entity55 ( @entity69 ) ; @entity80 ( @entity81 ) ; @entity82 ( @entity83 ) : @entity84 ( @entity85 ) for some players , life can be too easy , especially if they get huge wages at such a young age			1
after the journey he has been on , there ’s no danger of @entity47 not appreciating where he is			0
he is a throwback but he is a quality player			0
i worried when he missed a penalty on the opening day but he has proved himself with some fantastic goals			0
he still has work to do , but he wants to improve and i like that about him			0
he certainly needs to work on his goal celebration ! his dance was part of a dare organised on @entity107 ’s @entity66 programme , but he had to have a couple of cracks at it after having a goal disallowed			0
his rise up the leagues has been a dream but it just goes to show that sometimes it ’s never too late to make it in the big time			0
@entity55 heads in one of two disallowed goals he scored in the draw against @entity74 @entity47 looks as if he is loving it in the @entity53 and the only way is up @entity36 's case for the defence much of the focus on @entity36 this season has centred around their attacking power : @entity75 , @entity127 , @entity128			1
it ’s easy to pick out and praise the players who are firing in the goals			0
but their defensive unit has been just as important , if not more so , in their success so far			0
at the moment it looks like they have the perfect combination of goalkeeper and back four			0
@entity141 is still a huge player for them and is obviously doing a fine job of improving @entity144 alongside him			0
@entity145 is solid as a rock at right back and @entity147 did brilliantly to set up @entity75 ’s goal at @entity149			0
@entity150 is a huge presence behind them and @entity153 must be a dream to have in front of your back four , always protecting the defence and putting out fires			2
at the end of the @entity162 game @entity36 ’s defenders came together for a huddle			1
if they keep that unit working for the rest of the season they will be hard to stop			0
@entity36 's defensive players have not had as much praise as the likes of @entity128 ( third right ) but they have been integral to their club 's charge to the top of the @entity53 table @entity141 ( second right ) looks as if he is straining every sinew in his bid to keep @entity162 at bay city have to mind the @entity180 @entity61 aside , @entity74 have been poor this season			1
at times they have been a one - man team			2
it was a fantastic game against @entity69 but whatever @entity185 says , they were lucky to escape @entity187 with a point on saturday			0
they had a slow start last season — they were six points off the top at the same stage — and came back to win it			1
but the landscape of the league has changed			0
@entity36 look so strong and if @entity74 are n’t careful they could be out of the running before they know it			1
the international break has come at a good time because they desperately need something to change and soon			0
@entity61 scores his second goal of the game against @entity69 - at times @entity74 look like a one - man team city are struggling at the back and @entity211 ( second right ) scores an own goal at @entity187 a masterclass from @entity215 the @entity217 invasion is in full swing in the @entity53 , but not many people would have expected an @entity220 to upstage a @entity221 on sunday			1
@entity76 looked like he had won it for @entity77 , but @entity223 completed a magnificent fightback thanks in no small part to @entity226			1
he put on an exhibition of old - school wing play			1
he was strong , quick and went past @entity229 at will			0
it ’s not a game the young defender will want to watch back , but he should do so he can learn from the experience because @entity226 was magnificent			2
@entity226 ( left ) was superb for @entity223 against @entity77 and gave @entity229 a torrid time a much needed win to boost @entity236 it has been a rough ride for @entity236 on their return to the @entity53			1
i ’m a fan of @entity240 and what he ’s done at the club , but they really needed a result to kick - start their season , which they got against @entity247			1
@entity248 ( centre ) is congratulated by @entity250 ( right ) after scoring the winner against @entity247 @entity236 need last season 's strike pairing of @entity254 ( left ) and @entity255 back together 47 - goals scored by @entity254 and @entity255 in all competitions in 2013 - 14			1
it ’s all well and good getting draws but what they really needed was three points on the board			2
at times they have defended well this season and kept a clean sheet against @entity247 , but what they really need is goals			2
they miss @entity255 , who was so deadly with @entity254 last season			0
once @entity255 returns from injury , he will be desperate to fire @entity236 up the league			2
@entity273 delighted with first win of the season			2

@entity1 just wants to play at @entity10 - he could move
@entity55 is loving each second of playing in the @entity53
@entity36 's defence have been integral in power surge to the top
@entity74 have to mind the gap at top of table
@entity223 's @entity226 produced a masterclass against @entity77
@entity236 's win against @entity247 was much - needed - now they must score more
