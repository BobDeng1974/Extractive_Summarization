once , table salt was just a big tub of @entity2 decanted into a shaker			1
today , a host of salts in a rainbow of colours are claiming pride of place in our dining rooms			0
so , are they worth their designer prices ? @entity14 £ 85 , 12in platter , divertimenti.co.uk what it is : a huge , round slab of pink salt that looks more impressive than my marble kitchen			1
top chefs are serving seafood on salt blocks instead of plates			1
it ’s also a fun dinner party trick ( just wipe with a damp cloth after each use )			0
@entity29 is a part of most foods but rarely given a second thought alternatively , a smaller block can be passed between guests with a grater , like a block of @entity37 , so they can serve their own salt			1
the blocks are harvested from the @entity40 in northern @entity41			1
@entity29 deposits were formed 600 million years ago when an inland sea evaporated , leaving behind crystals in an eye - catching pink shade due to the presence of iron oxide			1
best for : as a platter to serve a starter of prawns , scallops or smoked salmon			1
or grate over tomato and mozzarella salad for a pretty glitter			0
verdict : i served prawn mousse wrapped in smoked salmon on this slab and my guests loved it			1
the saltiness is absorbed delicately by the food			0
i used a second slab so we could grate salt onto our main course of chicken ballotine			1

the result is small crystals of an intense pink hue and an overwhelming smoky aroma			1
best for : adding a distinctive smoked flavour to blander dishes			1
it works well on salmon fillets ( sprinkled with salt and lemon and cooked in foil ) , scrambled eggs or in soup			1
verdict : when @entity101 told me this smoked salt works brilliantly with creme brulee , my favourite dessert , i thought they were joking			1
i ’m still not convinced they were n’t , though it certainly turned this custard pudding into a talking point			0
3/5 @entity111 ’s @entity110 £ 4.50 for 70g , souschef.co.uk what it is : if you love steak seasoned liberally and washed down with a fine red wine , then this is the perfect salt for you			1
it ’s infused with @entity118 and @entity119 , turning it a blood - red colour			1
this creates such a dramatic effect that its @entity125 page has been shared almost 1,000 times , making it the first salt to become a social media star			1
best for : rubbing into steak as a seasoning			1
the red wine flavour combines with the bite of the salt for a deep - flavoured steak and succulent juices			1
alternatively , sprinkle on a salted caramel pud for a dash of blood - red drama			1

the result looks like tiny flakes of coal			0
best for : using as a decorative salt to transform ordinary food into the extraordinary			1
sprinkle on a pizza topped with ripped mozzarella and @entity173 ham for a simple yet memorable supper			0
verdict : this tastes like any other salt , but using it transformed me from tea - time @entity179 into a culinary superstar			2
i stirred it into chilli instead of the usual table salt and it turned my mince a deep , rich , plum colour			1
for a dinner party , i melted white chocolate and poured it into discs , then sprinkled black salt on the top and allowed the discs to set			2
the results looked incredible and my guests loved the combination of chocolate and salt			2
5/5 @entity198 @entity197 £ 2.75 for 250g , bart - ingredients.co.uk this salt is harvested from salt flats on an island off the @entity203 coast what it is : this is harvested from salt flats on an island off the @entity203 coast			1
water collects naturally and is then evaporated by the sun and wind			0
the natural crystals are scraped up with rakes			0
it is stored , but not fully dried , giving it a softer taste and the texture of wet sand			0
best for : cooking with rather than sprinkling			0
if you want your poached fish to have a sea water taste , it ’s perfect			2
however , this ‘ wet ’ salt does n’t work as a garnish at the table , as it does n’t break down easily , leaving big lumps			2
verdict : do n’t make the mistake i did and put it into a salt grinder			2
it sticks and wo n’t sprinkle			0
i liked the milder taste — it tastes like a mouthful of sea water			0
taking advantage of its wet texture , i mixed it with herbs and rubbed it on pork to make spectacular crackling			0
2/5 @entity240 @entity239 £ 10 for 120g , eicfinefoods.com what it is : peach - coloured flake salt is extracted from @entity240 ’s biggest river basin , which is dominated by the @entity245 and @entity246 rivers			2
originally , it was farmed for use in the building trade			0
then chefs tried it and discovered it was as delicious as it is pretty			0
the delicate colour comes from sodium , potassium , calcium , magnesium and iron suspended within a crimson coloured brine in river basins			0
peach - coloured flake salt is extracted from @entity240 ’s biggest river basin , which is dominated by the @entity245 and @entity246 rivers tens of thousands of years old , the brine changes composition and colour according to the weather — bleaching in the sun , but darkening in the winter — so your salt can be apricot , pale peach or almost crimson at various times			2
best for : it melts quickly when you cook it , breaking down into the food , so you can adjust the seasoning quickly without having to wait for the saltiness to kick in			0
however , this salt is so pretty it is best used as a garnish for baked potatoes , grilled meat and fish			2
i wet the rim of a @entity289 glass , dipped it in the pink flakes and served spectacular cocktails to my friends			2
verdict : so mild in flavour that the @entity240 say you can eat it out of your hand — and they are right			0
if you ca n’t stomach strong tasting salt , this is the prettiest alternative you ’ll ever find			2
if @entity301 did salt , it would look like this ! 4/5 @entity304 £ 10 for 250g , eicfinefoods.com what it is : said to be one of the oldest and rarest salts in the world , it is famed for its blue colour and sharp , distinctive flavour			2
when the crystals formed more than 260 million years ago , some were highly compressed without oxygen or light , causing them to turn sapphire blue			0
best for : adding a quirky decorative twist to white fish or sprinkled over beef carpaccio			0
the bright blue colour adds impact , but it tastes like any normal salt			2
verdict : it comes in a jar sealed theatrically with wax and labelled so beautifully in blue and gold that it looks more like luxury bath salts than the edible kind			0
@entity332 , it is like any rock salt — crunchy and hard			2
i do n’t like rock salt on salad because i find the taste too harsh , so i tried this on poached white fish			0
the crystals melted into the fish , leaving an occasional startling blue speck			0
but you are paying for the colour , not the taste			0

the slab of pink salt looks is more impressive than a marble kitchen
