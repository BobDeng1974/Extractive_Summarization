when @entity1 took over at @entity2 earlier this summer , the future looked bleak for @entity3			1
there appeared to be no place for the 29 - year - old in @entity8 's favoured 3 - 5 - 2 formation and , after a poor campaign under @entity11 last season , @entity3 looked almost certain to be offloaded			1
five games later , however , and @entity3 looks to have saved his @entity2 career by reinventing himself as a wing - back in the mold of @entity16 , who caught the eye at the @entity18 with some industrious displays for @entity20			1
but his defensive limitations were exposed against @entity30 on monday morning			0
a lapse in concentration allowed @entity28 to run in behind him leading to @entity51 hacking down the @entity30 midfielder and conceding a penalty - which @entity54 duly dispatched			0
an isolated lapse may be , but @entity3 has never been known for his defensive qualities			0
when sir @entity58 or @entity11 needed an auxiliary right back in the absence of @entity61 , they always turned to @entity62			2
the @entity63 has more physical presence and big - game defensive experience than @entity3 who , after all , has only impressed in his new role in meaningless pre-season friendlies			2
no @entity70 thing : Â£ 30m man @entity71 ( left ) has been told to improve his fitness by @entity1 competition : @entity62 has been preferred at right in the past that @entity3 bulking up : @entity3 takes part in a opening training sessions before @entity2 's victory over @entity30 focued : @entity3 concentrates on his exercises during @entity2 's open training session last week in the @entity38 last season @entity3 managed a little over a tackle a game ( 1.14 ) compared to @entity62 's 2.32			1
in 20 games , @entity3 managed to block just one shot and make 10 interceptions			0
@entity62 by comparison blocked six shots and made 39 interceptions - although he did play nine more games			2
@entity62 also made more headed clearances and won a higher percentage of tackles than @entity3 , who also fails in comparison to @entity61 and @entity70 - who will also be challenging for the wing - back spots			1
in defence of @entity3 , however , @entity61 for all his attacking qualities still has a tendency to jump into tackles			0
@entity62 has not been as potent going forward as @entity3 , while @entity70 will have to prove he is able to step up to playing for a big club like @entity2			1
it is clear that none of @entity8 's options are perfect but he has seen something in @entity104 that @entity58 and @entity11 did n't			0
the @entity105 has been keen to get his players thinking on and off the pitch and it was interesting that @entity3 was chosen to speak alongside the @entity105 at a press conference last week - something which rarely happened under @entity58 and @entity11			0
spot on : @entity16 scores a penalty for @entity20 against @entity112 at the @entity18 making his mark : @entity16 tackles @entity114 ( left ) and shows his crossing ability during the @entity18 tight marking : @entity16 gets to grip with @entity116 of @entity117 during the @entity18 @entity3 spoke well and it may be that @entity8 is hoping he can reinvent and tutor the winger in a similar way to how he used @entity16 at the @entity18			1
@entity16 , a former striker turned winger , impressed for @entity20 as a left wing back and the pair share certain similarities			1
@entity3 too is a good athlete and hard worker able to get up and down the pitch well			0
@entity3 also prefers to play on the left rather than the right - ' as a right - footed player , you can cut inside , have a shot and link up with the midfielders and forwards ' - and with doubts over @entity70 's fitness , he may well start @entity2 's opening league game against @entity135 on august 16			1
defensively @entity3 will have to improve if he is to keep his place in the team but he is very much the in - form man			0
and if @entity3 keeps scoring and proving a threat going forward it will be hard for the @entity105 to ignore him			0
however this experiment turns out , @entity3 at the moment deserves praise for reigniting his @entity2 career and the @entity145 faithful will be hoping to see a new and improved man wearing the no 19 shirt this season .			2

@entity3 scored four goals during @entity2 's pre-season tour of @entity45
29 - year - old seemed certain to leave @entity145 earlier this summer
@entity3 has played at left and right wing back in @entity2 's pre-season games
@entity3 faces competition from @entity70 , @entity62 and @entity61
