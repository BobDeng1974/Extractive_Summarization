by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 a ‘ lack of trust ’ in his relationship with @entity10 has been cited as the reason why sir @entity3 will not be on the start line in @entity5 for this year ’s @entity6			1
while @entity12 insisted on friday that a final decision on team selection would not be made until the end of this month , @entity11 broke ranks to say he was ‘ gutted ’ not to be riding			1
he will not be alone , with @entity20 cycling now faced with losing its biggest star for the three days the @entity6 will be here in the @entity20 next month			1
losing its biggest star when he happens to be in top form , having recently won the @entity6			1
‘ if @entity27 does n’t ride it will be a disaster for the sport in this country , ’ said one senior figure in cycling			0
‘ here was a chance to showcase the sport here in @entity32 with the last two winners of the @entity6 , who are both @entity20			1
but because they do n’t get on , the one who ’s most popular with the fans is not going to be there			0
’ absent : sir @entity3 said he is gutted not to be racing in the @entity39 the situation points to a complete failure by @entity12 ’s management to resolve a problem that has existed between the two riders since the 2012 tour			1
sir @entity46 has proved himself a master administrator for more than a decade			0
but @entity11 pointed out that he and @entity10 have been kept apart all year — not racing or training together — and that he has therefore been denied any opportunity to prove he is prepared to play support rider to last year ’s @entity6 winner			1
in an interview with the @entity53 on friday , @entity11 said : ‘ the team is focused around @entity10			2
i feel i am in the form i was two years ago			0
now if i want to go to the @entity6 again , the reality is that i might have to go elsewhere			2
i also understand that cycling is a team sport and it is all about @entity12 winning and @entity10 is defending champion			1
‘ for the dynamic of the team , @entity10 has a say and we have n’t raced together all year			0
when you ’re in the heat of the moment , you need guys you can trust and who have been there for you			0
tensions can rise between two riders			0
’ tension : @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 fell out during the @entity73 ambition : @entity11 hopes to race in the @entity6 again , and wants to return to the track for @entity76 it would be wrong to portray @entity11 too much as the victim here because there has been a degree of stubbornness on both sides in resolving the situation			1
this despite claims by both riders that they had cleared the air during a training camp towards the end of last year			0
sources close to the pair say the atmosphere is ‘ dreadful ’ when they are together , with @entity10 sometimes ‘ intimidated ’ by a colleague of @entity11 ’s stature			2
but the key problem for @entity10 , says the source — after their very public spats in the wake of the @entity100 — is ‘ a lack of trust ’ within what is a team sport			0
with his contract expiring this year , @entity11 said he is considering his future at @entity12 having ‘ spoken to a few people ’ linked to rival teams			1
‘ having missed the @entity6 again this year , i would n’t like to leave it there , ’ said @entity11 , who also has his sights on a return to the track for the @entity76 in @entity115			1
‘ i ’d love to go back at some point so there is the chance that i would go back to the @entity6 next year			2
’ pedal power : @entity11 won the @entity6 earlier this year and is in the form of his life while @entity11 is bitterly disappointed , this will not necessarily play well for @entity10 , either			1
as he explained in a recent interview with this newspaper , he has a say as to which nine riders make up the team and it is clear he has had a major influence here			0
in a separate interview with the @entity134 sports daily @entity132 , @entity11 said : ‘ after @entity135 and the @entity6 , i felt good physically , i was ready to go			1
but these last few weeks , it has become more and more clear that i will not be at the @entity6			2
’ @entity11 said he last spoke with @entity12 principal @entity46 earlier this week — who suggested that he concentrate on preparing for the @entity137 in @entity138 this summer			1
home soil : the @entity39 will kick off in @entity5 on 5 july ‘ it ’s disappointing because it could have been my last @entity6 , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ i ’ve had my doubts since april			0
i hoped my performances would get me a place			0
but then , after @entity145 , i knew that they were all off on an altitude camp , but i was n’t involved , nor was i involved in the @entity6 reconnaissance rides			2
‘ the plan since the world championships last year was that , in an ideal world , @entity10 and i would ride together in the @entity6 and that everything would go well			2
i understood the role i would play , that @entity10 would be the leader and i was 100 per cent behind that			0
i wanted to play that support role			0
then @entity155 ( @entity156 ’s technical director ) told the press that i would have to fight very hard to win my place , that it was now @entity10 ’s team and that @entity10 clearly had a say in selection			0
’ @entity11 also said he had spoken to the @entity162 team about joining them next season .			0

@entity11 *reveals* he will not race in the @entity39
2012 champion wants to compete in race again and may leave @entity12
@entity11 aiming for return to track in time for @entity115
@entity6 2014 begins in @entity5 on 5 july
