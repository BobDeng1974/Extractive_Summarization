@entity0 are primed for another summer transfer battle with @entity2 , this time over @entity4 forward @entity3			1
following the club record £ 42.5million capture of @entity8 last summer , @entity0 manager @entity5 wants to make another marquee signing with @entity3 his no 1 target			1
@entity4 are prepared to let the @entity12 international leave as new manager @entity13 stamps his authority on the club			0
video : scroll down to see stunner @entity17 flash her bra after @entity3 scores in demand : @entity0 and @entity2 both want to sign @entity12 star @entity3 and the @entity23 have opened talks with @entity4 with a view to making a £ 22m offer for @entity3			1
however , @entity0 will probably have to raise their offer as @entity2 have already discussed a £ 30m bid			1
@entity4 officials , who arrived in @entity30 on wednesday to start formal talks with @entity2 over @entity32 , are prepared to use @entity3 as a makeweight in their attempts to land the @entity35			1
however , the @entity32 deal is not subject to @entity2 signing @entity3 , 25			2
wednesday ’s talks , which were led by @entity4 trio @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 , are said to have been productive			0
@entity43 star : @entity3 scored two and provided the same amount of assists however , it is understood @entity3 ’s representatives , if he is to leave the @entity48 , want him to move to @entity0 though the decision ultimately rests with @entity3			2
if @entity3 turns down an @entity51 move it would mean only a straight @entity4 cash offer of around £ 80m would persuade @entity2 to sell @entity32			1
the fight to land @entity3 , who is also interesting @entity55 , is the second time in 12 months @entity2 and @entity0 have gone head to head in the transfer market			1
last summer , @entity0 ’s attempts to sign @entity32 and their subsequent £ 40,000,001 offer for the @entity35 infuriated @entity51 chiefs			0
@entity4 bound : @entity32 is in talks over a move to the @entity48 ironically , if @entity3 does move to the @entity65 he would love to go to @entity66 because he has been a fan of @entity55 since boyhood			2
@entity5 has a £ 100m transfer kitty to strengthen his side ahead of next season and wants a striker , a central midfielder , a right - back and a back - up goalkeeper			0
the @entity23 have an interest in @entity3 ’s international team - mate @entity76 , but the midfielder ’s £ 40m asking price is likely to prove prohibitive despite @entity0 ’s healthy financial position			2
attracting interest : @entity3 's form in @entity82 has n't gone unnoticed by the @entity65 big guns their bid to persuade @entity86 to part with @entity88 is proving difficult , so the @entity23 are now ready to turn to @entity90 ’s @entity89 in their search for a defensive midfielder			0
@entity0 , however , are confident of signing @entity94 striker @entity93			0
@entity2 did complete one deal on wednesday , taking @entity96 , 20 , on a two - year deal after the defender left @entity99			0
goal machine : @entity0 are confident of landing @entity94 striker @entity93			0

@entity12 ace @entity3 is @entity5 's no 1 target at @entity0
@entity2 have discussed a £ 30m move for the @entity4 forward
