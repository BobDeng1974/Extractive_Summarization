the huge $ 111 million budget cut to @entity2 's national science agency announced in prime minister @entity3 's may budget has led to top scientists being forced to refill photocopiers , a report has claimed			1
a senior @entity9 scientist has exposed the menial tasks they and their colleagues are now being forced to carry out because of the axing of 100 support staff			1
the scientist , who is paid $ 150,000 a year , told the @entity15 he is spending half a day a week washing glassware			1
' they 're doing their best to keep the money in the science , but the consequence is that high - level scientists do a lot of menial tasks because there is no one else to do them , ' he said			0
the man , who did not want to be named , said staff are being distracted from research because they have to clean laboratories , handle post and check chemical stocks			0
' most recently it has been around scientists collecting and distributing mail , ' mr @entity38 told @entity45			1
' there is limited staff in a reception capacity also in storerooms , scientists are now picking up dangerous chemicals and coordinating the administrative part of that , ' he said			2
mr @entity38 explained that 100 support staff were cut earlier this year as part of the three hundred job losses in a @entity9 restructure			1
he warned that there have also been cuts to support areas in previous years and it has been a cumulative trend rather than a one off			0
' it 's really important to hire people to do the work that needs to be done rather than having highly skilled scientists doing support staff work			1
@entity9 , @entity2 's national science agency , has been heavily impacted by government cuts ' scientists immensely value the support staff as it allows them to get on and do their job , ' mr @entity38 added			1
@entity9 has three national research facilities , including the @entity73 at @entity74 , @entity75 and more than 30 other research facilities around the country			2
in august it was announced @entity9 is shutting down its bowel cancer and neurological research programs , due to the budget cuts forcing a a 20 percent reduction of staff between june 2013 and june 2015			1
' it 's not a throwaway line about making @entity9 more efficient , these budget cuts directly result in shutting down areas of research , and we want our elected representatives to be more transparent about that , ' mr @entity38 said			1
' you 're essentially down to the bare bones , there 's not a lot left to cut			0
we want to make people making these decisions accountable as to what happens as a result			0
' @entity9 staff association secretary @entity38 said ' scientists are now picking up dangerous chemicals ' due to funding cuts last year , there were 513 redundancies at @entity9 , reducing their total workforce from 6,500 by eight percent , to 5,964 in june 2013			1
it is estimated that another 750 jobs will be cut across the organisation in the next financial year , meaning @entity9 will suffer a 20 percent reduction of staff in two years			2
@entity111 ceo @entity110 said the closure of @entity9 's bowel and rectal cancer research program was ' a step backwards ' , especially given that bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in @entity2			1
' any cuts to bowel cancer are of serious concern			0
15,000 people are diagnosed each year , and funding to bowel cancer research currently does n't reflect the burden of disease accurately in this country , ' he told @entity45			0
he stated that while bowel cancer accounts for around 13 percent of all cancer diagnosis , research funding has typically not reflected the burden of disease , receiving between 7 and 10 percent of @entity131 funding for cancer research and treatment			0
while there are other government , not - for - profit and commercial groups engaged in bowel cancer research , mr @entity110 pointed to @entity9 's involvement in developing a blood test for bowel cancer that is currently being piloted in the @entity141 for people who can not or will not carry out screening with the recommended stool test			2
' it 's really a sad day for bowel cancer			0
' the areas of @entity9 that will suffer job cuts have not been fully announced , but are set to include 40 jobs across both the colorectal cancer and neurosciences research areas , and eight full - time researchers from @entity73 ( @entity73 ) in @entity74 who investigate bio-security threats to humans that can be transmitted from animals			2
mr @entity38 said the morale at @entity9 is ' very despondent '			2
' these latest cuts to @entity9 are particularly illogical and short - sighted , ' he said			0
' we want to make people making these decisions accountable			0
' @entity45 has reached out to @entity9 for comment .			0
