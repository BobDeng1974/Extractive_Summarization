by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 10:02 est , 12 february 2013 @entity1 has surged to its biggest lead over the @entity3 in the polls for a decade as female voters continue to desert the prime minister			1
if a general election was held today @entity8 's party would probably secure 41 per cent of the vote while @entity12 's conservatives would get 29 per cent - down four per cent in a month			1
female support for the @entity3 is plummeting as among women 26 per cent more would vote for @entity1 - 51 to 25 - whereas @entity1 only get seven per cent more support from men - 36 to 29			1
result : a joint @entity18 poll today gave @entity1 their biggest lead over the @entity3 for a decade more bad news : the poll also found that many more women would vote for @entity1 than the @entity3 ( the remaining numbers would vote for other parties ) losing the battle : a new poll shows @entity12 's @entity3 are leaking votes to @entity8 's @entity1 after his party gained its biggest lead for a decade a further bitter blow for the prime minister will be that his pledge to offer an in / out @entity34 referendum has not secured the support he had hoped for			1
instead eurosceptic rival @entity37 's share has gone up three points to nine per cent , according to a @entity18 / @entity18 poll out today			2
the party has also broken a promise made by the chancellor while in opposition to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1million			0
but by freezing the threshold at £ 325,000 to 2019 to pay for social care changes the @entity11 could lose even more core votes			0
meanwhile the ailing @entity48 are also losing support as heir share of the vote has sunk two per cent to 13			2
disappointed : @entity12 's promise from an in / out @entity34 referendum has not helped at the polls either scandal : @entity57 , pictured with his partner @entity58 , resigned as an mp after admitting last week he asked his ex-wife @entity60 to take his speeding points scramble : all the political parties are sending their big guns to @entity65 , including @entity66 , in a highly - anticipated by - election the @entity3 have not had such a low share of the vote since 2003 , when @entity71 's government received a boost when @entity73 was toppled			1
this was before @entity75 lurched into civil war and the scandal over the dodgy dossier became public			0
@entity12 's ratings are similar to @entity80 's and will be tested later this month during the @entity65 , the seat vacated by disgraced former minister @entity57			0
the latest @entity18 / @entity18 poll shows a dramatic decline in the @entity11 share of the vote , but @entity12 ’s personal ratings are down			2
only 31 per cent say he ' understands people like me ' , a fall from 42 per cent in august 2010			0
one in three ( 37 per cent ) thinks he ’s ' good in a crisis '			0
but the @entity1 lead appears to be despite @entity8 's leadership as only 18 per cent think he ’s good in a crisis , and 35 per cent thought he ' understands people like me ' , only slightly better than mr @entity12 .			1

@entity18 / @entity18 : @entity1 41 ******%****** , conservatives , 29 ******%****** , @entity48 13 ******%****** , @entity37 9 ******%******
female voters deserting @entity3 for @entity1 - 26 ******%****** more would vote for them
in / out referendum promise has not stopped @entity37 gaining votes
@entity1 lead despite lack of faith in @entity8 as leader
only 18 ******%****** asked thought him ' good in a crisis ' - half @entity112 's rating
