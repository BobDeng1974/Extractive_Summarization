days before the annual @entity38 last month , mr @entity0 wrote on his blog : ' having visited @entity40 twice - once with my family and once with local schools - i am saddened that the @entity11 , who suffered unbelievable levels of persecution during the @entity4 , could within a few years of liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on @entity37 in the new @entity48 and continue to do so on a daily basis in the @entity50 and @entity51			1
' he was summoned to the meeting with mr @entity15 and @entity1 chief whip @entity53 where he was told his use of the phrase was ‘ unacceptable and must not be repeated ’			1

’ @entity119 , chief executive of the @entity63 , said : ‘ this is a disappointing response to mr @entity0 's sickening and unacceptable comments which he has kept on his website			2
