a notorious rapist walking the streets of @entity2 has been granted anonymity by a judge as he uses human rights laws to dictate to the authorities where he wants to live			1
the violent sex attacker is using @entity9 8 of the @entity10 to demand that he be allowed to move from @entity11 , where he committed his crime , to another part of the @entity2			1
but even before the case has been heard , a judge has thrown a cloak of secrecy over proceedings following an application by his lawyers			1
anonymous : the rapist has been granted anonymity by the courts before proceedings start they have obtained a strict court order banning the @entity28 from telling the public who he is , or giving any detail which might identify him			2
the man , whose identity is known to the @entity34 , raped a woman after breaking into her house armed with a knife			1
he was sentenced to more than a decade behind bars but released after serving half his sentence			2
like other prisoners ‘ on licence ’ he must remain in a particular place and report to the @entity43			2
he applied to the @entity44 to be allowed to move from @entity11 to another part of the @entity2 , where he is originally from and where his family now live			1
when the authorities refused , he launched a legal appeal under @entity9 of the @entity10 , the right to a private and family life			1
his case is thought to be funded by legal aid			1
judges have granted the convicted sex offender anonymity following an application by his lawyers a full hearing in the case will take place this week			0
a court order made by @entity64 judge mr @entity63 said nothing should be printed which could reveal who he is and what he did			0
the judge did not make clear his reasons for imposing the order , other than to note a claim by the rapist ’s lawyer that naming him would have an impact on his family			0
he said : ‘ i do … accept that , given the apparent particular press interest in the case , the issue of anonymisation is best determined in advance of the substantive hearing			0
‘ i have provided for preliminary anonymisation but it must be understood that that may not be continued at or after the hearing			0
’ @entity87 mp @entity86 called for a review to ensure anonymity is not given too easily to ‘ such despicable individuals ’			0
she said : ‘ the first point to make is that clearly secret justice in this case is showing utter disregard for the victim of this appalling crime			0
yet again we are seeing the criminal justice system on the side of the offender and not the victim			0
