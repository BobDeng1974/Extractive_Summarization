a defiant father - of - ten who has had his @entity1 lights up for almost five months is refusing to take them down despite being branded a ' pikey '			1
@entity4 got a friend to put up the huge festive display on his council house after he suffered a stroke in november			1
he stopped turning them on in january but said they helped calm his autistic son @entity11 , 15 , and plans to switch them back on for @entity13 in april			1
despite the good cause he has received a poison pen - letter from someone on his street in @entity18 , @entity19 , calling his family ' pikeys ' and the lights ' grotesque ' , ' tacky ' and ' an eyesore '			1
the letter said : ' i know you live in a council house but there 's no need to make it look like one '			1
row : defiant father - of - ten @entity4 is refusing to take down the @entity1 lights still hanging outside his council house backlash : a neighbour put this poison - pen letter through his door , calling the lights ' grotesque ' and the family ' pikeys ' good cause : mr @entity4 says that the lights are good for his autistic son @entity11 so he has kept them up since november mr @entity4 now says he has even more lights in his garage , which he will add to the collection on his house			1
he suspects that the abuse has come from people on his street who have bought their house			2
sad : @entity4 , 53 , who lives with wife @entity51 , 46 , who cares for @entity11 full - time , said the letter upset him the poison pen writer sent an anonymous letter addressed to ' the pikeys that live at number 80 '			1
it read : ' i am fed up of seeing your grotesque , tacky , council house @entity1 lights			1
' it is march for goodness sake			0
your house leaves this lovely community looking a disgrace			2
it looks like a state			0
it sticks out like a sore thumb			0
' i do n't want to keep driving past this eyesore , every time i do my kids scream			1
' i know you live in a council house but there 's no need to make it look like one			1
' yours sincerely , a very disgruntled citizen			0
' @entity4 , 53 , who lives with wife @entity51 , 46 , who cares for @entity11 full - time , said the letter had upset him but said he planned to put up more lights , rather than take them down			1
he said : ' i was shocked and quite upset when i got the letter			2
but they 're not coming down			2
they 're not doing anybody any harm			2
' i do n't switch them on until it comes nearer @entity1			2
' apart from that they 're going on in april which is autism awareness month , because i have a 15 - year - old autistic son			1
' i 've had neighbours who have said they will join in and also donate to autism charities			0
' response : mr @entity4 has refused to cave in to pressure and says he will put even more lights up festive cheer : the family believe it brightens up the area but a disgruntled neighbour told them : ' i know you live in a council house but there 's no need to make it look like one ' fundraising : the @entity114 hope that the display will raise cash for autism charities he added : ' i think the person who sent the letter comes from the posh side of the street			1
' our side is all council houses while the other side is where the houses have been bought			2
' they think they 're better than us but the only difference between us and them is that they buy their pile of bricks and we rent ours			2
it 's still my house and i 'm proud of it			1
' we keep our garden nice and tidy but we like the lights			0
the principle is nobody tells me what to do in my house			0
' we 're going to make sure the house is covered and really give them something to whine about			1
' one neighbour said a petition was started to try to get @entity4 to remove the @entity1 lights , although many residents in the street are divided over the ongoing display			1
@entity152 said : ' i heard someone started a petition and a few people had complained , i do n't know who would have sent the letter though			1
' i 'm not really bothered by the lights being up , it does n't really affect me			1
' another resident , @entity160 , 71 , said : ' i 'm with the old age pensioner lot			0
there is a big divide between the people who have purchased their houses and the council house lot			1
conspiracy : mr @entity4 suspects the rude note came from people on his street ( pictured ) who may have bought their house ' i 'm not offended by the lights , i think if he has been ill then that 's actually a good enough reason not to take them down			1
' i think it 's a bit petty to send a letter , you would think they would just talk to him			2
' another resident , who asked not to be named , said the author of the letter was ' sad '			0
the word ' pikey ' is believed to have been used as early as the 16th century			0
but it was not seen in print until 1837 , when @entity187 used it to describe strangers who visited the @entity190			0
the actual origins of the word are unclear			0
it could be connected to the word ' turnpike '			0
these were toll roads , which had rotating barriers made of sharp poles called pikes - and vagrants were known to gather in these areas in the 18th century			0
an alternative version of the word is ' piker ' , which is said to have come from the verb ' to pike ' - which once meant to run away			0
in recent years gipsies have complained when the term is used against them and say it is insulting			0
it is also used in the modern day as a term to insult someone of supposedly low class			0
she said : ' do people not have anything better to do than moan about @entity1 lights still being up ? they 're not even on			2
it 's a bit sad			0
' residents also took to social media to express their opinion on the matter			0
@entity226 wrote on @entity227 : ' absolutely disgraceful ! ! have people lost their minds ? ' is this really causing anyone physical harm ? emotional harm ? physiological harm maybe ? the answer is no. ' i ca n't believe money and resources are being spent on worrying about @entity1 lights on someone 's house			1
' do n't we have more things to concentrate on			0
like the youth of today and resourcing places for them to go ... thefts in and around the area			0
' the bullying at schools , need i go on ? leave them alone			0
' @entity252 , who said he lives next door to the family , wrote : ' we live next door and have offered to take them down , but in all honesty our kids love them and we have a good relationship with our neighbours so if they need them down then we will help			2
' @entity4 , who used to run a pub but is now unemployed , responded to the outcry by saying he has a garage full of more lights which he is now planning to put up next week .			1
