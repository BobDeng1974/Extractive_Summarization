700,000 - 1 odds : proud farmer @entity12 has never heard of a trio of cows being born at the same time from the same mother , despite working on the farm in @entity7 all of his life @entity12 , 44 , said : ' i 've been here for over four decades and my dad has been farming for 75 years			1
we 've never heard of cows having triplets			2
it 's very very rare			2
' i could n't quite believe it when i saw three calves			1
she 'd had two and we thought that was it - it 's not uncommon for twins to be born			1
' but we looked again and a third had been born			2
she was in a field on her own so they 're definitely all hers ! ' @entity12 , who runs @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity7 , with his wife @entity42 , has 74 cows in total and since they began calving at the beginning of august , they have had around 180 new arrivals			1
family portrait : the triplets are ' the most special of the farm 's new generation ' however the triplets are without a doubt , the most special of the farm 's new generation			2
father - of - two @entity12 said : ' they are all boys and because they arrived so soon after the royal baby , we decided to call them @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
' it 's a little moment in history us having such a rare arrival so it was only right to mark the occasion			0
come along : apart from 73 other cows , the farm has more than 3,000 hens and houses a free range egg business ' @entity69 was big during her pregnancy so we expected twins but it never even crossed our minds we might have triplets			0
' the family also house more than 3,000 hens and run a free range egg business from the farm			0
only last week , they cracked one to find it was a triple yolker			0
' it had to be a sign , ' said @entity12			0
' people get excited over double yolkers , but we had a triple and then a few days later had triplet calves			1
someone was trying to tell us something ! ' the three young calves are not idential triplets , which means they have come from three separate embryos the calves are not identical , meaning they have come from three separate embryos			1
for the last two years , number 901 has given birth to single calves , and there is no indication that after having triplets , she may do this in the future			1
@entity12 said : ' we will just have to wait and see			0
it would be unbelievable if it happened to us again with such unlikely odds , but we will wait and see ! ' for now we will enjoy the triplets			0
they are incredibly cute and certainly have the ' aww ' factor ! ' and @entity12 's children , @entity110 , 14 , and @entity111 , 10 , are thrilled by their new additions			0
@entity12 added : ' they think they are great			0
it 's lovely that we have got them			0
the kids are chuffed to bits			0
' they like to help feed them - they 'll be weaned off their mother soon so @entity110 and @entity111 will be getting their hands dirty ! '			2

the three male calves came into the world at @entity6 , @entity7
