@entity9 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , may no longer be *eligible* for her offered plea deal after court documents reveal she kept daily contact with the teen girl she 's on trial for having sex with

@entity9 was offered a plea deal on her 19th *birthday* but had not indicated if she would accept when documents *detailing* her recent ' lewd and lascivious behavior ' were revealed
' @entity145 ! ' : @entity9 's mother @entity341 was also *implicated* in the documents and now faces charges she helped her daughter cover her tracks
