by @entity0 they 've long been known as the most cunning animal around - and it seems this urban fox is happily living up to its reputation			1
a fox with a foot fetish from @entity9 , @entity6 has been swiping pairs of shoes from unsuspecting residents - and dropping them off as gifts to a neighbour 's garden			1
@entity16 and her husband @entity17 keep waking up to different pairs of shoes - including designer trainers , work boots and even smart leather shoes - which have been dropped off overnight by the animal			1
@entity16 , 40 , from @entity9 , @entity6 , pictured with her daughter @entity25 , set up a stall to return shoes to her neighbours because an urban fox keeps delivering pairs of footwear to the family 's garden it all began when the fox delivered a pair of y - fronts to the family - and soon the fox had brought them nearly 40 pairs of shoes			1
the family have now become so inundated with random pairs of shoes that they set up a shoe stall outside their home , in a bid to return the shoes to their rightful owners			1
the family believe this mother fox is responsible for the shoes deliveries to their home mrs @entity16 , 40 , said : ' we started putting them in the garage and when we had two full carrier bags , i decided enough was enough			1
' some were quite good quality and new			0
there were brands like @entity63 and @entity64			0
we got hiking boots and even a man ’s workboots			0
' mrs @entity16 said the mother fox has stolen around 30 to 40 shoes from her neighbour 's doorsteps and porches			1
she said : ' it started a few months ago when a pair of @entity75 appeared on the lawn in the back garden			0
' i looked out the window and saw what i thought was a pair of underpants , and it was			0
it was quite alarming really , but then the next day there was a shoe left in the same place			1
' i realised there was an animal bringing them and then on a daily basis we got a shoe delivered			1
' the shoes - which are never damaged and include expensive brands - are left overnight by a mother fox with a den nearby			1
mrs @entity16 said : ' we see the fox around a lot			1
she has five cubs and it ’s no doubt it ’s her			0
there will be a stash of shoes in her den. ' she gets them from people ’s houses around here			1
we see a lot of garden shoes and kids shoes that might have been left outside			1
' i think she might bring them back as toys for her cubs			0
she is very tame and she gets very close to us			0
' despite advertising the miscellaneous shoes to their neighbours , @entity117 and mrs @entity16 still have a large pile of unclaimed footwear			1
they also have a pair of baseball gloves and the item of underwear left by the fox			2
she said : ' we have had a few pairs but they are mainly odd shoes			1
a lot of people have claimed a shoe which is very satisfying after my daughter went around with some flyers asking if anyone had lost one			2
' there ’s a little girl on our avenue and she came to collect a shoe			2
she was really happy because it was one of her new red vans and she thought she had lost it			0
mrs @entity16 said the fox has brought the family up to 40 pairs of shoes from her neigbours ' homes to their garden - which include designer trainers , work boots and even smart leather shoes ' cars pull up all the time to have a look			1
someone thought i was having a clear out and that they were my shoes			2
' i was mortified in case anyone thought they were my shoes in case they recognised them as their own			2
' as the drop - offs remain as frequent as ever , mrs @entity16 believes the fox may only stop being so generous when her cubs have left the den. after finding so many pairs , the family set up the shoe stall to return the footwear to the rightful owners			1
although many people have come to claim the shoes , the family still have a large collection leftover she said : ' the shoes are never damaged so i think it ’s something to do with her being a mother			2
' she ’s just carrying them as if they were a cub so she might stop when they are older			0
' you could wear the shoes again except for when they ’ve been left outside and got wet			2
a lot are leather and they ’re never chewed			0
' it used to be really exciting looking out the window to see if a shoe had been left - just like looking out to see if it ’s snowed at @entity198			2
but now it ’s just another shoe			2
' it ’s strange because we have n’t had any stolen			0
she just brings other people ’s to us			0
' @entity206 expert @entity205 said : ' a fox family will tend to consider up to 500 homes and garden as its territory and will constantly patrol this area looking for items to take home			1
' it used to be really exciting looking out the window to see if a shoe had been left - just like looking out to see if it ’s snowed at @entity198			2
but now it ’s just another shoe			2
' @entity16 ' as the fox ’s den is close to this family ’s home , it will consider the garden an extension of its own home and part of its territory			1
' shoes are a particularly common item for foxes , especially trainers			2
teenagers ’ trainers left outside to air are very easy for them to grab and make off with			0
' the fox will take the shoes somewhere they know they wo n’t be bothered and examine them for anything edible			1
if they find no use for them they will either give them to their cubs to play with or abandon them - in this case in this family ’s garden			0
' at this time of year when the cubs are three months old and turning into teenagers , it ’s as well not the leave anything out at night			0
' some of the family 's neighbours have also had mysterious pairs of shoes cropping up in their garden			1
@entity259 , 76 , who is married to @entity260 , said : ' we have received several shoes , left for us by foxes			1
i ’d say we ’ve had about three or four , and they ’re always old garden shoes			2
the sit of the garden where the fox leaves shoes for the @entity16 family ' i ca n’t remember what i did with the first few but then when i heard about @entity16 ’s shoe rack , i took one of them down and actually found its matching pair			1
' it was n’t until i spoke to @entity16 that i realised we were n’t the only ones and i was amazed to hear how many they ’ve been left			1
' @entity281 , another neighbour , 53 , said : ' we do see a fox around in the garden , especially at night			0
' not long ago , my son was actually playing with his electric remote - controlled car in the street outside when the fox actually sat and watched him for a while			0
' it ’s likely to be the same one as it did n’t seem phased to be around people			0
' and dr @entity291 and his family regularly receive visits from the urban wildlife			0
he said : ' the foxes love coming to visit the @entity296 ’s			0
just last night we saw the vixen with four of her cubs walking across the garden			0
' they ’ve never brought us any shoes however , they just seem to like wandering around here			0
we back on to the @entity306 ’ house so it ’s easy for them to access			0
' it ’s becoming quite a talking point around here though , i ca n’t believe how many people have got to know the foxes , and how much bother they ’re causing stealing people ’s shoes			0
