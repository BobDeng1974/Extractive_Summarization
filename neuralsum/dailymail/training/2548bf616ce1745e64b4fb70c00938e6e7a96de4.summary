as a qualified teacher , @entity0 will be more familiar than most with half - term reports			1
this lunchtime clash at @entity4 marked six months in the @entity6 hotseat for the @entity7 — and an appraisal of his performance so far would make for positive reading , if noting a need for improvement			1
on this evidence , @entity13 will have no trouble in claiming their fourth - successive league title			2
it took a matter of minutes for them to carve open @entity4 here , with @entity21 notching a simple goal after just six minutes			1
but if @entity0 's side continue to be as wasteful in front of goal as they were against a lacklustre @entity28 side , the manager can forget any dreams of an elusive domestic treble			1
@entity31 , in particular , was guilty of spurning a number of chances which kept the @entity4 firmly in the game			2
@entity13 's @entity21 slots home the only goal of the game in his side 's one goal victory at @entity4 @entity21 celebrates with his team - mates after scoring against @entity4 early on in the game at @entity40 it was @entity21 ' sixth league goal of the season , helping the @entity44 to their second win in just four days while @entity13 still have great deal to do , though , they demonstrated at @entity40 that @entity47 is still capable of classy , entertaining football , at least			1
at the end of a tumultuous week in which a fair few home truths about the national game were laid bare , this meeting of last season 's top two clearly exhibited @entity47 football 's strengths and flaws			2
snooker , boxing and darts impresario @entity59 tore into the @entity63 while speaking at their annual convention on wednesday — highlighting the lack of sponsorship , alcohol ban and dwindling crowds as key factors in the @entity47 game 's decline			0
yet @entity13 boss @entity0 blasted back at the former @entity74 owner , standing up for the passionate atmosphere and exciting play he has witnessed during his brief tenure			1
this match certainly delivered noise in spades — due largely to the vast sea of green behind one goal — yet there were still swathes of empty seats in the home sections amongst the 7,740 crowd			0
this was in no small part to the disastrous start to the campaign endured by last season 's runners up — a 1 - 1 draw at @entity6 in september was a meagre highlight in a campaign otherwise devoid of moments to savour			0
@entity97 closes down @entity13 captain @entity98 during a temultuous fixture at @entity40 on saturday tempers flared somewhat when @entity13 's @entity98 ( third left ) squared up to @entity4 's @entity97 it was a feisty affair and @entity13 were on top of the game for the most part against a struggling @entity4 since then the goals — and performances — have dried up , with managerless @entity4 winning just once in nine and scoring only six			1
a run of five straight defeats drove @entity112 to call it a day and caretaker boss @entity114 is yet to inspire a full - scale revival			0
@entity114 has applied for the job although former @entity118 midfielder @entity117 has been strongly tipped to succeed @entity112			0
in the first - half here , the @entity4 appeared every bit as uncertain as their off - field issues with @entity13 dominating from the off			1
having rubbished claims that @entity47 was a long - ball nation in midweek , @entity0 practised what he preached as the @entity44 executed a passing masterclass — to the extent that even goalkeeper @entity129 resisted punting forwards in the opening 45			2
they should have been in front almost immediately when @entity98 threaded a perfectly - weighted through pass to @entity31			0
the industrious @entity134 raced clear but dragged his finish wide of the upright			0
despite having a hatful of chances @entity13 were particularly wasteful in front of goal on saturday afternoon @entity141 ( right ) tracks down @entity4 's @entity142 in his side 's one - goal victory but @entity13 made amends moments later as @entity146 , pressing high up the park , won the ball on the edge of the box			1
the @entity151 rounded the onrushing @entity152 and cut back to @entity21 , who slotted comfortably past the two @entity28 defenders on the line			2
the hosts could not handle the combative @entity146 and @entity156 — impressing in place of the injured @entity158 — and @entity13 soon created another opening			2
@entity156 knocked the ball across to @entity98 , who instinctively let it run through his legs to @entity163 — taking @entity165 's place wide right — in space to the right of the penalty area , but the winger could only fire wide			1
it took 15 minutes for @entity4 to even string two passes together and , when they did , @entity97 blasted high and wide from distance			1
moments later , @entity146 was robbed by @entity97 on the far touchline and the midfielder embarked on a mazy run			0
yet , with few team - mates in support , this rare glimmer of quality from the @entity4 proved futile			2
@entity13 then spurned yet another chance			2
this time @entity156 fed @entity31 just outside the box , who tucked a neat backheel to @entity146 which the @entity7 drilled straight at @entity185			0
@entity4 were forced into a change when right - back @entity187 limped off and was replaced by @entity189			0
@entity4 's @entity190 is sent off for this tackle on @entity13 's @entity163 just after the hour mark @entity190 's lunge on @entity163 left @entity4 with a huge task as they looked for a second half equaliser the visitors should have been 4 - 0 up at the break but could have gone in level when @entity4 fashioned a superb opportunity			1
@entity200 found @entity201 out on the left and his drilled cross was touched behind before @entity142 could pounce			0
the @entity4 continued to press after the break — @entity205 playmaker @entity200 blazed wide after @entity141 and @entity156 failed to clear their lines			0
despite lacking their first - half fluidity , the visitors still looked incredibly dangerous and @entity163 almost doubled his side 's advantage when his 18 - yard shot was saved			1
yet @entity4 's task was made even more difficult when @entity190 was dismissed midway through the second period for a reckless lunge on @entity163 on the edge of the area			1
dead - ball specialist @entity31 could only find the @entity13 supporters with the subsequent free - kick , but his side immediately sought to make their numerical prowess count			0
the 22 - year - old fluffed his lines once more — somehow stumbling @entity226 's cross from the left into @entity185 — before the keeper made an astonishing stop to deny @entity163 from only two yards out			1
@entity114 threw on @entity229 and @entity230 and the substitutes came agonisingly close to snatching an unlikely leveller			0
@entity229 swung an excellent ball in from the right which unmarked @entity230 somehow nodded wide			0
the striker was then booked for diving in a bid to win a penalty and @entity129 , for the first time , launched his goal kick to safety .			0

victory at @entity40 is the second win in four days for @entity0 's men
three points mean @entity13 remain top of the @entity247
@entity248 forward @entity21 put the visitors ahead after six minutes
@entity4 's @entity190 was shown red for a foul on @entity163
