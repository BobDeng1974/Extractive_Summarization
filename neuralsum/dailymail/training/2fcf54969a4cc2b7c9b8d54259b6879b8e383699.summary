at the final whistle , a gentleman behind the press box cursed loudly and luridly			2
the small boy alongside him tugged at the sleeve of his overcoat : ‘ can we go home now , @entity9 ? can we , @entity9 ? @entity10 ! ’ and as we sat in the freezing dusk of @entity13 , struggling to take in a terrible football match , all our sympathy went out to the child			2
@entity17 fans are a tolerant lot			1
but the boos and jeers which rang around @entity21 at full - time after a 1 - 1 draw were seething with well - founded frustration			1
they were enjoying a perfectly outrageous lead through @entity27 going into the second minute of added time , when they collectively backed off a woefully ordinary @entity31 side , allowing them to attack at will			1
the equalising goal from the substitute @entity34 was the entirely predictable outcome			2
both sides are involved in what the sporting prints used to term ‘ a relegation dogfight ’			2
there are seasons when football fans yearn for mid-table mediocrity , and for @entity17 fans , this is just such a season			1
@entity17 have not won at home since the end of october			1
they have won nowhere since early november , and have now drawn 15 of their 28 championship matches			1
small wonder that the fans ’ charity is wearing thin			2
@entity17 boss @entity52 took charge of his first home match since taking over the reins at @entity21 the @entity56 react after conceding a late goal against @entity31 on saturday afternoon @entity27 had put @entity17 in the lead during the 83rd minute of the @entity60 encounter @entity52 is their fourth manager within the past 12 months			1
this was his first home game in charge , and within 61 minutes , those tolerant fans were chanting ‘ you do n’t know what you ’re doing ! ’ this may well be a new @entity69 record			2
summing up his debut last week , @entity52 said : ‘ the first thing we needed to stop was conceding goals			2
after that , we need to score			2
’ saturday night , he was singing a similar song			1
these are early days , of course , but i fear he is unlikely to stay long enough to collect a testimonial			0
if i seem concerned , then i confess all			0
for the best part of half a century , i have observed the code of neutrality when covering football matches			0
saturday , the final assignment , i shamelessly cast it aside			2
like most fans of clubs like @entity17 , i hope for the best but know that the worst is on its way			1
even when things were going well , during those years in the first half of the noughties , when @entity95 was keeping us in the @entity97 , we knew it was only a matter of time			0
the club is now owned by a chap who is apparently the 18th richest man in @entity103			2
this would be encouraging if @entity105 were not his passion and @entity17 his @entity13 bit on the side			1
the result is a football club which seems curiously unloved and under invested			0
of course , we have known far worse times than this			0
extended banishment to the dreaded @entity116 was once the only antidote to closure			0
@entity17 have struggled to replace former boss @entity95 , who left in 2006 it took perhaps the finest , most resourceful supporter involvement that the @entity69 game has ever seen to eventually negotiate a return to @entity21			1
by comparison , these are almost halcyon days			0
but it did n’t feel like that on saturday			2
the match programme , featuring a cover picture of @entity129 only made things worse , with its memories of better days			0
may 25 , 1998 , most @entity17 fans could recall that date as readily as their own birthday			1
the best match ever staged at @entity137 ; including the ’ 66 @entity139 final , the ’ 53 @entity141 final , the lot			0
and @entity129 scored a sensational hat - trick , as @entity17 clawed their way back time and again to secure a 4 - 4 draw			1
thirteen penalties later , they beat @entity147 to enter the @entity97			0
under @entity95 , it was the @entity17 version of a golden age			1
it seemed an eternity ago , as @entity152 bounded along the touchline , waving a hand , bawling unheard into the middle distance			0
i doubt that @entity95 would have bounded quite so pointlessly , nor that other @entity17 managers of yore — @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and others — would have gone ignored			1
still , the fate of the @entity17 follower is to look back at the way things were			1
@entity17 owner @entity167 appears to focus the majority of his attention on @entity105 @entity17 had to relocate to @entity170 's @entity116 while @entity21 , pictured in 1988 , was renovated and here 's what @entity21 or @entity13 , as it is also known , looked like back in the 1950s the young local reporters present were far more sanguine than we veterans on saturday			1
i envied their confidence , their assumption that things would work out fine			0
back in the @entity182 , i used to cover the occasional @entity17 match for the local paper			1
in my second or third game , as a novice reporter , i described a @entity17 centre half as ‘ the finest in the @entity188 ’			1
the sports editor was a kind man			0
‘ i take it you ’ve seen all the others ? ’ he enquired			0
naturally , i had n’t			0
he smiled , and sent me off to make the office tea			0
after so many years , i have learned the danger of such sweeping judgements , yet still there is the conviction that what can go wrong , will go utterly wrong where @entity17 are concerned			1
and yet , as the followers of such football clubs will tell you , it is n’t the despair that gets to you ; it ’s the hope			0
for all the disappointments at @entity21 , all the evidence of a team in tatters , we cling to that hope in the face of form and logic			1
the next stage is a return to partisan status			0
meanwhile , on the far side of @entity13 , over to the west , an oligarch ’s whimsical investment was preparing to play a sheik ’s vanity project			0
@entity225 is 12 miles from @entity21			1
for all they now have in common , it may as well be on the moon			0
and yet , we would n’t swap it for all the oil in @entity232			0
and home is where the heart is .			0

@entity237 chooses to sign off his his *remarkable* *career* by *reflecting* on life as a @entity17 supporter
@entity17 drew 1 - 1 with @entity31 at @entity21 on saturday afternoon
the @entity56 are currently 18th in the championship
