by @entity0 anger : @entity2 was stopped from breastfeeding her eight - month - old daughter @entity3 at a swimming pool in @entity5 a midwife has spoken out after she was told to stop breastfeeding in a public swimming pool because the lifeguard thought it was ' offensive '			1
@entity11 was swimming with her eight - month - old daughter @entity3 at a leisure centre in @entity13 , @entity5 , when the baby started to get restless			1
the 27 - year - old mother of two sat on the steps of the learner pool and began to feed her daughter - only to be asked to move by the manager of the facility			1
ms @entity2 said she would go to the side of the pool after being told that the lifeguard was ' offended ' , but the manager instead requested that she finish the feed in the changing room			1
the midwife today said that she had been ' embarrassed ' and ' humiliated ' by the incident last saturday , which bosses at the @entity30 later blamed on health and safety regulations			1
' at the time i was embarrassed because i did n't know who else could hear what she was saying , ' ms @entity2 said			2
' i felt humiliated and she made me feel like i was doing something wrong			2
' afterwards , when i remembered her saying my breastfeeding was offensive , i was really angry			0
' this has n't made me reluctant to breastfeed in public and if i go back to the pool i will still breastfeed there , but some women would have been put off by being treated like this			0
' the manager of the centre claims that @entity48 footage shows ms @entity2 breastfeeding @entity3 while the baby 's head was level with the water in the pool			1
but the mother said : ' it is irrelevant whether i was in the water or not because that is not what the staff member said to me to begin with			0
' she did n't mention health and safety issues , she just said one of her colleagues had been offended by me breastfeeding			0
' family : ms @entity2 , a midwife , with her daughter @entity3 and her mother @entity64 , also a midwife miss @entity2 's mother @entity67 , who also works as a midwife , accused the centre of discriminating against nursing mothers			1
' it is discrimination to ask a woman to move on account of the fact she is breastfeeding , ' she said			1
' the word offensive was used several times both at the @entity30 and when my daughter spoke to a member of staff on the phone afterwards			0
should mothers be allowed to breastfeed in swimming pools ? ' it 's 2013 , for goodness ' sake - you see more body walking around the streets ! my daughter is very discreet			2
i want a public apology and assurance that the @entity30 has a policy in place to protect breastfeeding mothers - not discriminate against them			2
' @entity30 manager @entity96 said : ' at the centre we have regular users who breastfeed in the cafe , so breastfeeding is widely accepted			0
' this is the first time breastfeeding has taken place in the pool environment and i stress that the only reason the mother was asked to move was purely down to the feed taking place in the water			1
' we have apologised to the mother involved if some unfortunate words were used in conversation and will ensure all staff are fully aware and trained accordingly			0
' ms @entity2 said she would go to the side of the pool after being told that the lifeguard was ' offended ' , but the manager instead requested that she finish the feed in the changing room the manager of the centre claims that @entity48 footage shows ms @entity2 breastfeeding @entity3 while the baby 's head was level with the water in the pool apology : bosses at the @entity30 in @entity13 have said sorry to ms @entity2 for the incident last saturday @entity130 , chief executive of @entity131 which runs the centre , has now apologised to ms @entity2 and claims the company supports the right to breastfeed			1
' @entity131 fully supports breastfeeding at all its sites and understands the legal rights of mothers to do this , ' she said			0
' on this occasion it was believed there was a legitimate health and safety risk - i.e. feeding actually taking place while both the mother and baby were in the water , and a suitable alternative area just a couple of metres away was suggested			2
' we do of course apologise for any upset caused			0
the staff were concerned for the health and welfare of the baby			0
it may be that this concern was misplaced due to a misunderstanding of the situation , but it was not intended to discriminate against the mother			0
