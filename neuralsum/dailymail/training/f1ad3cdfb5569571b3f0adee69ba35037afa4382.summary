having a few glasses of wine after work may be doing you more harm than good , according to a new study			0
despite a large number of studies suggesting moderate alcohol intake may protect against heart disease , new research done by the @entity7 looks to challenge this stance			1
the @entity15 ’s @entity14 study explored the association between alcohol consumption and mortality in different age groups to determine the suitability of age - specific alcohol limits as well as different ways of defining ' non-drinkers '			2
a new study into moderate alcohol intake may disprove the idea that having a few glasses of wine after work may be good for you one of the authors of the study was associate professor @entity30 , from the @entity7 's @entity31 and @entity7 , said the overwhelming publication of previous research had exaggerated the advantages of having a few wines every day			1
he said other research had been skewed by the inclusion of people who did not drink in their studies , regardless of their reason for not indulging - where it be abstinence or health problems			0
this time scientists took a more exact approach in their research and attributed their study 's damning results to this point of difference			0
in the first stage of their study , they used ex-drinkers as a comparison group to moderate drinkers and found protective benefits were the same across all age groups			2
associate professor @entity30 , from the @entity7 , said the overwhelming publication of previous research had exaggerated the advantages of having a few drinks every day but in the second stage , they separated never drinkers out as a comparison group and all protective benefits disappeared			1
' previous studies have considered non-drinkers regardless of why they do n’t drink			0
in those groups who have never drunk there are those who stop drinking because of lifestyle choices or medical advice from doctors or those with problematic drinking patterns or people who have specific health issues from alcohol problems , ' @entity66 told @entity79			0
' these ex-drinkers who stop drinking for health reasons have a higher risk of death or get a disease than the rest of the population including moderate drinkers			1
' those ex-drinkers who stop for health - related reasons are essentially making moderate drinkers look better			1
' he said other research had been skewed by the inclusion of people who did not drink in their studies , regardless of their reason for not indulging - where it be abstinence or health problems while the study does not answer the question of whether people should indulge or completely give up alcohol all together , @entity66 said it did highlight the importance of other strategies to maintain good health			2
' the message from this study is @entity107 should not use claims of alcohol ’s health benefits as a license to drink and the alcohol industry should not use health - related messages to promote its products , ' he said			1
' @entity107 looking to improve their health should adopt more effective health and wellbeing - promoting strategies like being physically active in their everyday life or adopting regular exercise , rather than take up drinking			0

a study done by the @entity7 has challenged that a few drinks has health benefits
previous research has indicated moderate alcohol intake may protect against heart disease
in this study scientists separated never drinkers from the non-drinkers to get more accurate results
he said ex-drinkers who stop for health - related reasons were essentially making moderate drinkers look better
