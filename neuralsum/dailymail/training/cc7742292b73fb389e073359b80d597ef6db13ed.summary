by @entity0 published : 13:29 est , 15 march 2014 updated : 13:52 est , 15 march 2014 storm : @entity3 caused outrage by saying gay marriage had caused an @entity7 style flood a local politician who claimed @entity9 was flooded because the nation legalised gay marriage is being investigated over claims he broke his council 's code of conduct			1
@entity3 , 73 , was thrown out of the @entity9 @entity17 and had his house egged after he made the claim in a letter to his local newspaper in @entity22 , @entity23			1
protesters attached a rainbow banner to his home and more than 25,000 people signed an online petition calling for him to resign			1
now it has emerged officials are investigating him after 12 people lodged formal complaints of councillor misconduct			1
they claimed the @entity22 town councillor broke a 19 - point code of conduct , which includes a clause that says councillors must treat other people with respect			1
the investigation has been elevated to @entity45 - but if officials do decide he broke the code , the strongest punishment they can issue is a reprimand			1
councillor misconduct is an internal issue , not a criminal one , and they have no powers to suspend @entity55 or remove him from office			2
a spokesman for @entity45 said the investigation would take a minimum of a month and begin by the end of march			0
' the investigator will judge the case against the precedents to consider whether the code of conduct applies in this case , ' he added			2
' if the code is deemed to have applied , the investigation will judge whether the councillor breached it			2
' in the aftermath of the row in january , @entity22 - on - @entity72 council clerk @entity71 issued a strongly - worded statement denying the council 's involvement			1
' the use of the council 's name ] has caused many residents of @entity22 and indeed further afield to conclude that the personal opinions expressed by @entity83 in his letter are somehow associated with the views of @entity22 - on - @entity86 , ' he said			1
' this is not the case and the @entity86 strongly refutes any suggestion to the contrary			0
' unrepentant : the 73 - year - old would not apologise for his views and received 12 formal complaints @entity17 leader @entity94 was forced to intervene - expelling @entity55 but defending his right to hold what he called ' barmy ' views - after the party initially refused to take action			1
the row was sparked after the 73 - year - old wrote : ' the scriptures make it abundantly clear that a @entity104 nation that abandons its faith and acts contrary to the @entity106 ( and in naked breach of a coronation oath ) will be beset by natural disasters such as storms , disease , pestilence and war			1
anger : the letter appeared in the @entity116 ' i wrote to @entity118 in april 2012 to warn him that disasters would accompany the passage of his same - sex marriage bill			1
' but he went ahead despite a 600,000 - signature petition by concerned @entity123 and more than half of his own parliamentary party saying that he should not do so			2
' it is his fault that large swathes of the nation have been afflicted by storms and floods			0
' he has arrogantly acted against the gospel that once made @entity9 " great " and the lesson surely to be learned is that no man or men , however powerful , can mess with @entity139 with impunity and get away with it for everything a nation does is weighed on the scaled of divine approval or disapproval			0
' speaking to @entity146 in january @entity55 said he had quit the @entity147 over gay marriage			0
he said : ' the conservatives are known as the party of the @entity151			0

' there is a command to love all men , and i hope i love all men , but we are also taught to love the person but hate the sin			0
' when told hundreds of people thought he was crazy , he said : ' that may be so if you are not a person of prayer			2
i am a person of prayer			0
i pray for each member of the @entity172 every day and each member of the royal family every day			0
