a woman has been left scarred for life after a beautician botched a laser hair removal treatment - on her face			1
mum - of - two @entity5 , 55 , has terrible scarring under her chin after she spent £ 50 to get some wispy hairs removed at her local salon			1
but instead of leaving her with a smooth chin , @entity5 is forced to cover up her scars daily with heavy make - up , after the unqualified beautician scored her face with deep burns by using the powerful laser on its highest setting			1
she said : ' i had been there before for facials and massages , and the woman was really nice and friendly			0
' i thought long and hard about having laser hair removal treatment , and then decided i should go for it , ' she says			1
' when she put the laser on , it hurt so much i jumped out of the chair			0
it was such an intense burning			0
' the woman said it was normal , and did another patch , but that hurt just as bad			0
' then she said that maybe she should turn the laser down			0
i have a high threshold for pain , but that was absolutely agonising , ' adds @entity5			2
left : the burns straight after the treatment ; right : how they look 6 months later after completing the 20 - minute treatment , @entity5 left the salon with a burning sensation in her face			1
it was only the next day that she realised something was seriously wrong , when her skin broke out in sores and blisters			0
her doctor told her the laser had caused first degree burns in her skin , which would leave permanent scarring			2
now @entity5 has teamed up with a trade body , to call for tougher regulations for laser hair removal treatment			1
the @entity63 is lobbying the government to introduce an official register of approved practitioners to prevent further injuries like @entity5 ’s			2
@entity5 said : ' it was only afterwards that i realised these people did n’t need any training , or licencing , to operate quite dangerous machinery			2
' my face felt like it was on fire for days - all because she did n’t know how to operate the machine			0
' i want nobody else to go through what i ’ve had to endure , and that ’s why we need to make a change in the law to make certain these people have proper training			0
' at the moment we are unprotected by rogue beauty therapists with powerful lasers			0
' mum - of - two @entity5 spent £ 50 to get some wispy hairs removed at her local beautician @entity63 operational director @entity90 explained : ' there is n’t any regulation at the moment and that puts people at risk , so always background check a practitioner and ask if they have had the training before considering treatment			1
' it was found that there has n’t been as much risk with lasers , hence why the government does not support regulation - yet this is a problem but it ’s the responsibility of the patients to find out about the practitioner			0
' laser hair removal , which involves high - powered laser lights killing hair follicles at the root , was regulated by the @entity114 until 2010 when it stopped approving licences for non-surgical procedures			1
a @entity119 spokesman said : ' we want to make sure everybody who undergoes laser hair removal receives good standards of care and is aware of the risks			1
' we are working with @entity126 to review training and qualifications for providers of non-surgical interventions - including laser hair removal			1
' sk : n are the @entity133 ’s leading laser hair removal providers , who have held a partnership with the @entity136 for more than 20 years			1
the lasers used at sk : n are safe to use with all skin types and treatment is delivered according to strict medical protocols , as monitored by in - house @entity142			2
only practitioners who have completed months of intensive , supervised training and have achieved medical sign off are allowed to treat			0
