@entity14 allegedly shouted ' i ’m going to kill you you f * * * ing b * * * * ’ before stabbing @entity3 in the head and neck with a 4in screwdriver			1
the frenzied attack was only interrupted when a passing motorist spotted what was happening and intervened , jurors heard			2
@entity14 , 48 , then ' calmly walked off ' into his parents ' house			1
he had known the headmistress for 10 years and in his pocket was a piece of paper saying ' @entity32 ' , the court heard			1
he was quickly arrested - telling police he had suffered ' ten years of abuse ' and had three plastic bag full of thousands of documents to prove it			1
bruised and bloodied , 39 - year - old mrs @entity3 was airlifted to hospital where she survived , despite suffering a 3cm deep cut to the side of her head and and another to the lower back of her skull , which had hair pushed into the wound			1
today she returned to give evidence against her neighbour from behind a screen at @entity5			2
mrs @entity3 , who lives with her husband @entity49 and daughter @entity50 in @entity51 , @entity52 , said the attack happened in april last year as she returned from work at @entity56 primary school in nearby @entity57			1
she said : ' i got home at about 5pm and there was nobody around when i pulled on to the drive			0
' i went round to the boot to get my laptop and noticed someone standing next to me , then i realised it was @entity14			2
i did n’t have a chance to say anything to him			0
frenzied : the scene outside @entity3 's house in @entity51 , @entity52 , after she was attacked ' he was less than a metre away from me			1
i just saw him staring at me and before i had a chance and before i had a chance to say anything he went into his jacket and pulled out a screwdriver			2
' i was so petrified			0
as soon as he pulled it out he started attacking me with it			0
i did n’t say anything and he was saying " i ’m going to kill you , you f * * * ing b * * * *			1
" ' he had a really contorted face			0
he was aiming at my face			0
the only way i can describe it is frenzied			0
it was really quick with no pauses in between			0
' i felt the blows go into my head			0
he was using a lot of force because he had pulled on my jacket to pull me to him so i was close to him			0
the force pushed me on the floor so i was on my back			0
i was trying to fight him off			0
' mrs @entity3 's next - door neighbour @entity14 was ruled unfit to plead to any criminal charges due to mental illness she screamed but the attack continued , she said			1
' i remember kicking him to try and put space between us but my body twisted and then he got the back of my head , ' she said			0
' i continued screaming all the way through			0
he was saying ‘ i want to get you , you b * * * * ’			1
' it felt like it was going on forever			0
i was screaming and screaming and finding it hard to keep him off me			0
i remember thinking " this is it " , then a white van pulled into the side of the road			0
' then he got off me and dropped the screwdriver and went towards his house			2
the neighbours were now around and then my husband			0
@entity130 [ neighbour ] was holding my head and trying to stop the blood			2
' survived : @entity3 gave evidence from behind a screen against her alleged attacker @entity14 was ruled unfit to plead or stand trial due to his ' paranoid persecutory delusions '			1
therefore he is not charged with a criminal offence - a jury must instead look at the evidence and decide if @entity14 committed the attack or not			1
if they find he attacked mrs @entity3 , he will most likely have a hospital order imposed on him			1
mr @entity145 had known @entity14 for 10 years and grew familiar with him through his parents , the court heard , though there had been ' some issues ' between them			1
during her evidence , @entity14 was heard to shout to mrs @entity3 : ' i wanted you in court , i did n’t want you dead			1
' he also interrupted proceedings with shouts of ' perjury , perjury ' while mrs @entity3 spoke from behind a screen			2
prosecutor @entity159 said that when police arrested @entity14 , he claimed he had been harassed for ten years and pointed towards plastic bags that contained essential evidence			1
' in the bags were thousands of pages of documents written by @entity14			1
he was put in the van and searched			0
he had another screwdriver in the lining of his coat			2
the other screwdriver was spotted close to mrs @entity3 with blood stains on			2
' there was some blood from mrs @entity3 on the defendant ’s jeans and a small bit of paper was found in his jeans pocket which refers to killing someone			2
it said " @entity32 "			0
' in this ferocious and frightening attack , the threats that he was going to kill her and the paper in his pocket , coupled with where the blows were aimed at can only lead to one conclusion and that is you can have no doubt that he was trying to kill @entity3 on that day			1
' the hearing continues .			1
