he added a few words in @entity3 , saying he was trying to learn the language ' but it is difficult			0

' @entity2 's family is very warm and we have a very good time when we all see each other			1
' indeed , while most men would be intimidated by the idea of marrying a princess - mr @entity4 's family is no stranger to royal connections			1
his @entity91 mother , @entity19 , is a former girlfriend of prince @entity20 , and made headlines in @entity6 in 2003 when she invited @entity20 and his then - mistress @entity93 to the @entity94 , a high - society celebration of @entity97 's music which she organises annually in @entity98 , @entity99			1
when the @entity20 arrived at the festival , @entity19 greeted him with a warm embrace and kiss - to the evident discomfort of @entity93 , who would go on to marry @entity20 less than two years later			1
@entity20 and @entity19 apparently met at a polo match and started an affair in 1986 , when his marriage to princess @entity108 was starting to break down			2
one anecdote claimed that the couple were nearly caught in flagrante by @entity108 herself when she walked in to the changing room at the @entity114 in @entity115 , where @entity20 and @entity19 were being intimate			2

crown princess @entity185 gave birth to a baby , princess @entity190 , this year , and mr @entity4 accompanied @entity2 to @entity190 's baptism ceremony in may - a significant indicator of the proposal to come , as partners of royals are usually not invited to such occasions unless they are officially engaged			1
