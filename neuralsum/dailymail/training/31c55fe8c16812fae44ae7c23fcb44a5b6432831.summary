by @entity0 four daughters are in a stand - off with a @entity4 cemetery which refused to have their mother 's year of death put on the family headstone - because her ashes are not buried under it			1
@entity10 died aged 82 last april and her family had her cremated , splitting the remains among her children and grandchildren and placing them in jewellery			1
but when they asked to complete the family stone they have had since 1955 at the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 - which already bore her name and year of birth - the director refused			1
unholy row : the family of @entity10 ( right and left with her daughter @entity28 ) can not engrave the year of her death into a headstone on the @entity4 family plot because her ashes were not buried under it no closure : the headstone on the family plot which has existed since 1955 , where @entity10 was supposed to be memorialised next to her husband , @entity36			1
her daughter @entity37 called the spat ' ridiculous ' instead of the year 2013 engraved next to the details of several other relatives , including her husband @entity36 's , there is a large white space			2
the cemetery 's boss told them it was against tradition to recognise a burial unless all the remains are buried together in the plot			1
@entity28 , 48 - one of @entity10 's four daughters - told @entity53 : ' we do n't want her to be in the cold ground			1
it 's hard for us because we live all across the @entity57 and we just want her close to us			0
' mrs @entity28 , who lives 500 miles away in @entity58 , @entity59 , added : ' my sisters and i are n't catholic any more and we do n't know the rules of the church			2
' but my mother said " throw me in the tomatoes - maybe i 'll be good for the garden			0
' she would n't have cared			0
' we had the funeral for her last may so this has gone on for almost a year			2
the way he has handled this is ridiculous			0
paying tribute : daughters @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity37 at the headstone last year after their mother 's cremation argument : how the headstone looks now			0
the incomplete section for @entity10 can be seen bottom right ' the cemetery is very special to us and it 's where our father used to take us as a place of peace , so going there and seeing those numbers missing makes it very hard to grieve			1
' the daughters ' original plan was to bury the ashes as the 26,000 - plot cemetery would have wanted , but they changed their minds			1
to help ease the row they engraved ' in cherished memory ' above the name , but were still not allowed to complete the work , they said			0
their family plot is home to the remains of five relatives , including @entity10 's husband @entity36 , his parents and two others			1
@entity108 , the cemetery 's director , told the @entity110 : ' if you let this go , then what 's next ? " oh , i want to have a statue of @entity115 on the cemetery grounds			2
i want the crucifix upside down			0
i want the @entity118 with a dagger in her womb			0
" what 's next ? row : the strictly @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity22 , has around 26,000 plots he added : ' our policy is on christian burial beliefs , and when we have a person who has been cremated and they wish to have those cremated remains whole and buried at our cemetery , that is the only way we 'll recognise			1
' cremation has long been controversial among @entity134 , who see the body as a temple of the human spirit which should not be destroyed after death			0
@entity139 associated burning a body with paganism , and until recently it was banned completely by the @entity134			0
the @entity142 lifted its all - out ban on cremations in 1963 and from 1997 , cremated remains were given the same respect as remains in a casket at funerals			2
however , the church still forbids scattering ashes or keeping them separate or at home .			0
