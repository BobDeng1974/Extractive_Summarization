mr @entity27 gave the girls , who he said were wet , cold , and still in their traditional @entity3 attire , some watermelon and juice , and then , after a long discussion with his wife , decided it was better to drive the girls home rather than alert the police			2

the fire was believed to have been started by a stray cat knocking over a battery jumpstart box inside			0
the victims , their 11 siblings , parents , grandparents and other relatives are expected to be on hand for the big barn raising , mr @entity27 said , and they would be offended if they could not rebuild the couple 's garage			0

@entity88 , 39 , and his girlfriend , 25 - year - old @entity89 , lured the girls to their parked car saying they wanted to show them a puppy , then forcing the two into the back of their vehicle and speeding off to their home in @entity98			1

' she was the submissive one , ' @entity89 's attorney , @entity127 , stated last week			2
' i am currently researching on what happens when prisoners of war go through enhanced interrogation			0
