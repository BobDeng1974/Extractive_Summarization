by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:50 am on 15th november 2011 phone - hacking at the @entity2 became so widespread it was tantamount to a ‘ thriving cottage industry ’ , the @entity4 into press standards was told yesterday			1
at least 28 journalists at the @entity8 media group employed private detective @entity9 to carry out more than 2,200 illegal voicemail taps during seven years of eavesdropping on public figures			1
one journalist alone – referred to only as ‘ a ’ – made 1,453 requests , said @entity15 , counsel to the inquiry , chaired by @entity17			1
an astonishing 300million @entity8 emails are being examined by police for evidence of phone hacking			1
hacked : murder victim @entity23 's mother @entity22 ( front right ) , sister @entity26 ( front left ) and father @entity28 on a visit to @entity30 victim : murdered schoolgirl @entity23 almost 700 tape recordings of celebrities ’ voicemails were recovered during a police raid on @entity9 ’s offices five years ago			1
in his 11,000 pages of notes , detectives found the names and other details of more than 5,000 public figures			2
it was clear , mr @entity45 said , that bosses at the paper condoned , or turned a ‘ nelsonian blind eye ’ to what had become a ‘ systemic or cultural problem ’			2
the revelations blow apart previous claims by @entity8 that hacking was the work of @entity9 and just one ‘ rogue reporter ’ – jailed royal editor @entity57			2
journalists from the @entity59 and @entity60 were also implicated in the scandal as the inquiry heard that @entity9 ’s notebooks contained references to work done for the two tabloid papers			1
on the first day of formal hearings into press standards at the @entity68 : @entity17 stressed that the freedom of the press was ‘ fundamental ’ to the @entity75 ’s democracy and way of life but warned editors against targeting witnesses who speak out against intrusion by journalists			2
@entity8 records showed that ‘ @entity85 ’ – a pseudonym for @entity9 – was paid between november 2005 and august 2006 for information relating to ‘ @entity80 ’ , ‘ @entity81 ’ , ‘ @entity82 ’ and ‘ @entity83 and @entity84 ’			2
it emerged that police believe the @entity2 hacking operations continued until at least 2009			1
@entity90 set up the @entity4 in july after it was revealed that the @entity2 hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl @entity23 after she went missing in 2002			1
@entity94 ’s father @entity28 was at the @entity95 to hear details of the scale of phone - hacking by the @entity2			1
@entity9 ’s book - keeping system was explained to the hearing by mr @entity45			2
he said the private investigator wrote first names down in the top left - hand corner of his notes recording details of every telephone voicemail he illegally intercepted			1
mr @entity45 said : ‘ it ’s clear that @entity57 was n’t a rogue reporter			2
we have at least 27 other @entity8 employees			2
controversial : @entity113 chairman @entity112 , left , has faced pressure over the hacking scandal			2
senior executive @entity116 , right , resigned references to @entity119 , left , and @entity120 were found in @entity9 's notepad , the inquiry was told ‘ this fact alone suggests wide - ranging illegal activity within the organisation at the relevant time			1
’ he added : ‘ i suggest that it would not be unfair to comment that it was at the very least a thriving cottage industry			2
@entity129 senior management knew what was going on at the time and therefore , at the very least , condoned this illegal activity			2
‘ or they did n’t and @entity8 ’s systems failed to the extent that there was failure in supervision , failure of oversight with possible failures of training and corporate ethos and checking of expenses claims			2
’ former @entity146 assistant commissioner @entity145 was cleared of any wrongdoing yesterday , months after being forced to quit over the phone hacking scandal			0
the decision could pave the way for him to make a legal claim against the @entity152			0
the former information commissioner @entity153 will be questioned at the inquiry over his handling of an investigation eight years ago into a private investigator who obtained information for journalists			1
police searched an office of inquiry agent @entity162 in @entity163 in 2003 during ‘ @entity162 ’			1
the raid revealed he and three others had been paid to obtain information for newspapers and other organisations			0
some of the searches breached the @entity170 , but others were a lawful way of finding out information that was already in the public domain quickly , said mr @entity45			0
he said that in three years , 305 journalists had asked @entity162 for 13,343 different items of information			0
these journalists worked for a total of 21 newspapers and 11 magazines , although some worked for more than one publication			0
some 952 requests were from the @entity183 , with 58 journalists involved			1
the @entity185 had made 802 transactions from 50 staff , and the @entity60 had 802 transactions from 45 writers			1
the @entity190 made 681 transactions with 33 journalists , and the @entity2 made 228 transactions from 23 journalists			1
other newspapers involved included the @entity196 and @entity197			0
mr @entity153 had not supplied the identities of the journalists , mr @entity45 said			0
he added that it was ‘ not immediately obvious ’ why legal proceedings were not taken against them , but said the former commissioner had previously declared he could not be completely confident that there would not be a public interest defence			0
mr @entity45 said he ‘ will be inviting mr @entity153 ’ to expand on his reasons why			0
‘ that said , one appreciates that the @entity162 raid took place in march 2003 , and some might say that all of this is water under the bridge			0
’ by @entity214 and @entity215 warning : @entity17 , who is leading the phone - hacking inquiry @entity218 is ‘ fundamental ’ to protecting democracy , @entity17 declared yesterday			1
formally opening his inquiry , he said there was ‘ a great deal to applaud in the @entity75 press ’ – and he would not be limited to finding fault with the media ’s work			1
‘ from the very start i made it clear that i fully consider the freedom of expression and freedom of the press to be fundamental to our democracy and fundamental to our way of life , ’ he said			1
‘ but that freedom must be exercised with others in mind			0
’ on the subject of regulation , @entity17 said the work of the inquiry – which is expected to report its initial findings in september 2012 – could be summed up in one simple question : ‘ who guards the guardians ? ’ – an apparent reference to who oversees the work of the press			1
he said he had encouraged newspaper editors to meet and discuss these issues outside his hearings and submit ideas about how the press could be better regulated			0
any regulation ‘ must reflect the fundamental freedoms to which i have referred ’ , added @entity17			0
‘ but it must also recognise that “ guard the guardians ” is not an optional add - on			0
‘ neither is it good enough if it does not take account of the legitimate public concern , not only about phone hacking , but also other unethical behaviour not justified by what is truly in the public interest			0
’ the first part of the inquiry is looking at the culture , practices and ethics of the press in general			1
the second part , examining the extent of unlawful activities by journalists , will not begin until detectives have completed their work and any prosecutions have concluded			1
@entity45 , counsel to the inquiry , said it will be ‘ concerned with the developing law of privacy ’			1
he said a ‘ privacy law has begun to emerge ’ from an ‘ admittedly limited number of cases ’ over the past ten years			0
‘ there will be calls for a statutory privacy law			0
such a law could go further than the rights already protected by @entity293 8 [ the right to respect for privacy and family life ] of the @entity296 ( on human rights )			0
at the very least , this inquiry will need to address those calls in deciding whether to make any relevant recommendations			1
’ mr @entity45 added : ‘ the press holds the powerful to account and is therefore an important curb on potential abuse of executive and corporate power			0
at its best , the press espouses unpopular causes and gets to the bottom of scandals which would otherwise be left uninvestigated			0
it is essential in a functioning democracy that the press be permitted to discharge these vital functions			0
’ record : notes made by @entity9 aroused suspicions suspicion that the @entity59 and @entity60 might also be involved in phone hacking was aroused by notes in the corners of private investigator @entity9 ’s notebooks			2
@entity15 , counsel to the inquiry , said it was ‘ beginning to receive evidence that phone hacking was not limited to that organisation ’			2
referring to @entity9 ’s method of carefully recording every job undertaken , the barrister said actor @entity330 had brought a claim against the @entity59 for allegedly hacking his phone			0
part of the evidence in support of his case , said mr @entity45 , ‘ is a name in the @entity9 notebook which simply states “ the @entity59 ” without specifying the individual working there			0
‘ there is also documentary evidence which we have seen of another name relating to the @entity60			0
’ @entity59 , @entity75 ’s biggest - selling paper since the closure of its @entity8 stablemate the @entity2 , formed the bedrock of @entity112 ’s global media empire			1
but while being questioned by mps on the @entity353 last week , @entity112 ’s son @entity351 refused to rule out shutting down the @entity59 if it was involved in phone hacking			0
responding to the suggestion that @entity9 hacked phones for the @entity60 , a @entity356 spokesman said last night : ‘ it was not made clear to the inquiry which newspaper he was referring to nor did he elaborate on the nature of the “ evidence ” or how it “ relates ” to the @entity60			1
‘ the company has no knowledge of ever using @entity9			0

one journalist made 1,453 requests for voicemail taps , inquiry hears
