the results of an experiment on the @entity2 to monitor how ants cope with zero - gravity has been published			1
researchers found they managed surprisingly well , using other ants or the surfaces and walls as anchors to climb			2
however , their ability to search collectively did not go perfectly as they tumbled and fell while trying to explore			2
@entity21 astronaut @entity20 is seen here observing the activities of the @entity23 - 06 investigation aboard the @entity2 the study , @entity26 by ants in @entity28 , was published in the journal frontiers in @entity30 and @entity31			1
the ants were taken to the station in january 2014 and subsequently studied by astronauts on board			1
ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules , judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell			0
working together , the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies			0
when the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines , covering more ground			0
but in the micro gravity of space , the ants ' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work			1
these flexible principles could be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way , for tasks like searching a burning building			0
‘ we had no idea what the ants would do			0
we did n't know if they would be able to search at all , ’ said professor @entity64 , a biologist at @entity65 , to the @entity66			0
the experiment used eight different habitats in total , with each containing 80 common pavement ants			1
as barrier doors between the different sections were opened , the ants dispersed to search the new area			1
the astronauts then recorded the habitats with an hd video camera			1
a control experiment was carried out on @entity83 , and the results - perhaps unsurprisingly - showed that those on the ground were much better at searching than those in space			0
in fact , the ants were not even able to explore the entirety of their habitats in space , as they found it tough to grip and dropped off the surface for up to eight seconds at a time			1
at any one moment , the researchers found that seven per cent of the ants were floating around			1
the ants in @entity102 - 06 investigation looked at how an ant colony responds to the extreme environment of microgravity aboard the @entity2 to solve their collective need for resources			1
data gathered from this study may help with algorithms for robotics on @entity83			0
‘ the ants did not perform collective search as effectively in microgravity as they did in the ground controls , ’ the researchers wrote in their paper			2
‘ because ants in microgravity did not use straighter paths or traverse more distance when the area to be searched expanded , they did not search the area thoroughly			2
’ the researchers noted that one of the reasons the ants struggled to explore their might have been that they were unable to interact with others easily			2
however , it was not all bad news ; the ants showed an ‘ impressive ability to walk on the surface in microgravity , and an even more remarkable capacity to regain their contact with the surface once they were tumbling around in the air			0
’ the ants also made efforts to remain in contact with the surface			0
the ultimate goal , though , was to see how they could overcome problems in their collective search method - such as in a human - dominated environment - something which the ants adapted to fairly well			2
these might not be the most famous ants in space you remember : @entity157 , in the 15th episode of the fifth season of @entity155 ( @entity156 ) accidentally crashes in to an ant colony while in space ( shown )			0

researcher in @entity13 studied ants in zero gravity on the @entity2
astronauts were asked to monitor the ants in eight habitats on the station
when the ants tried to search , they struggled to keep their grip
some remained floating around for up to eight seconds at a time
