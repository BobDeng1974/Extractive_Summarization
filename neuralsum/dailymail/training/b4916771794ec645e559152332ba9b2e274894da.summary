by @entity0 the core of the @entity2 is nearly 1,000 degrees hotter than previously thought , making it as fiery as the surface of the sun. following new experiments , scientists have established that the core temperature is 6,000 c , much higher than the previous estimate of 5,000			1
using x-rays to probe into the behaviour of iron crystals , putting samples of iron under extreme pressure , researchers were able to examine how iron crystals melt and form			2
hot stuff : the inner core of the @entity2 , previously thought to be 5,000 degrees @entity23 is in fact 6,000 @entity2 's inner - core is a ball of solid iron , about the size of the moon , surrounded by a highly dynamic outer - core consisting mostly of a liquid iron - nickel alloy			1
experiments from the early @entity32 , measuring the ‘ melting curves ’ of iron , suggested that the core had a temperature of 5,000			1
the new tests , using one of the world 's most intense sources of x-rays located at the @entity42 , the research team were able to re-create the same pressure at the core			2
in order to do this the team used a device called a diamond anvil cell - essentially a tiny sample held between the points of two precision - machined synthetic diamonds			0
scorcher : the new estimate puts the core of the @entity2 at the same temperature as the surface of the sun then the scientists used x-ray beams to bounce x-rays off of the nuclei of the iron atoms , also known as ‘ diffraction ’ , to see how the iron crystals behaved			1
‘ other people made other measurements and calculations with computers and nothing was in agreement			0
it was not good for our field that we did n't agree with each other , ’ @entity65 of the @entity68 research agency @entity66 and a co-author of the new research , told @entity71			0
' we have to give answers to geophysicists , seismologists , geodynamicists - they need some data to feed their computer models , ’ dr @entity65 said .			0

new experiment put temperature of @entity2 's core at 6,000 degrees @entity23
estimate is 1,000 degrees higher than previous figures from the @entity32
