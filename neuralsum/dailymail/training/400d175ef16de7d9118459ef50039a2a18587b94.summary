a suburban @entity1 hospital has come under severe scrutiny after a very rare strain of a dangerous drug resistant strand of flu was found to be connected to a series of operations performed there			2
the @entity9 has discovered 44 cases where patients in @entity12 had a particular bacteria and 38 of those individuals had all recently undergone an endoscopic procedure at @entity16 in the past year			1
the bacteria , carbapenem - resistant enterobacteriaceae ( @entity19 ) , is extremely difficult to treat because it has unusually high levels of tolerance to antibiotics			1
dangerous hub : @entity16 is the site where 38 cases of the bacterial outbreak stemmed from but investigators still have n't been able to determine what caused the spread the fact that the outbreak has only occurred in people who have recently undergone surgery comes as little surprise since the @entity9 website states ' healthy people usually do not get @entity19 infections '			1
@entity19 is most regularly seen as a mutant form of a urinary tract infection that , if it spreads to the patient 's bloodstream , has a 40 to 50 per cent chance of being fatal			1
the question that investigators are facing now , however , is why this particular hospital is causing the spread of the rare bacteria			2
while @entity19 can be found in any number of patients who were reliant upon breathing machines or catheters , they have limited the field down slightly within those infected at @entity16			0
@entity55 @entity1 reports that the patients who face the most immediate risk are those who had an endoscopic procedure on their pancreas or bile ducts between january and september of 2013			2
' it ’s the largest outbreak that we ’ve seen in the @entity66 of this bacteria ever , ' infectious disease doctor and investigation supervisor @entity61 said			0
' this is a huge cluster , ' he told @entity69			0
fatal : when the carbapenem - resistant enterobacteriaceae ( @entity19 ) gets into a patients bloodstream , it is fatal 40 to 50 per cent of the time since the outbreak was spotted , 243 patients have been tested at the hospital and most of them had traces of exposure to the bug - which is called being ' colonized ' - and it had lived in their digestive tract but it did not progress into the disease form , meaning that they were fine			1
@entity55 @entity1 says that 28 of the tested patients had traces of the organism but did not have an infection			0
ten other patients had worse luck as they had traces of the organism but also had signs of infection and symptoms of the disease			0
the current status of those patients has not been released but the hospital said that a small percentage had been treated by antibiotics against , defeating the bug 's high resistance levels			1
hospital officials first noticed a problem six months ago after seven patients came back and were found to have @entity19 infections			2
the @entity9 then became involved in the issue and while they did not find anything wrong with the sterilization techniques used by the hospital , they took pre-emptive measures			0
' to ensure no other patients are at risk , we have moved to gas sterilization for these particular scopes , which exceeds the manufacturer ’s recommended cleaning and disinfectant guidelines , ' @entity111 , vice president of @entity112 at @entity16 told @entity55 .			0

44 infections have been *confirmed* in @entity12 , 38 of which come from the same hospital in @entity126
the bacteria - carbapenem - resistant enterobacteriaceae - is rarely treatable using antibiotics because it has extremely high resistance levels
if the bacteria gets in a patient 's bloodstream , there is up to a 50 per cent chance that it will be fatal
' healthy people do n't get ' the bacteria which is almost always traced to hospitals and patients who have undergone endoscopic procedures
