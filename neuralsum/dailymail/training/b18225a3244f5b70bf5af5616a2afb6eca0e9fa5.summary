by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 has suggested his side 's shock cup loss at @entity6 could hasten the departure of several players			1
@entity2 paid the price for making nine changes as @entity11 claimed a 1 - 0 win in their @entity14 second - round tie at the @entity15			1
the likes of @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 were among the players to come in and @entity2 was far from impressed by most of them			1
@entity2 did single out @entity21 - who was making his first appearance for the @entity27 in 16 months - for praise but , with monday 's transfer deadline looming , many of the rest could be heading out			1
asked if any business was possible , @entity2 said : ' absolutely			2
i still think we need a bit of quality in one or two areas			0
' there are one or two who played last night or are not going to get in my team who i think might be better moving on			1
' the future of former @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 winger @entity17 at @entity44 is again in question			2
the 32 - year - old has faded from the limelight since joining @entity3 three years ago in a move that was supposed to rejuvenate his career			1
on wednesday he was completely overshadowed - almost literally - and outplayed by his marker , the towering 6ft 5in defender @entity54 , and was withdrawn after 78 minutes			2
goal : @entity6 celebrate @entity57 's 77th - minute winner to knock @entity3 out out ? @entity17 ' @entity3 future is in doubt after struggling against @entity6 on wednesday night @entity20 hit the bar in one of @entity3 ' better moments , but the @entity63 is also in danger of drifting to the periphery			1
@entity2 said : ' i wanted an awful lot more ( from the wide areas )			2
i thought @entity20 did all right first half but @entity17 had a tough night			1
' @entity2 did say he would like @entity21 to stay but did not know the intentions of the @entity71 , who spent last season on loan at @entity75 and @entity76 and has a buy - out clause			1
struggle : @entity21 is another player who could be leaving @entity44 , despite @entity2 's desire to keep him as well as any transfer business , @entity2 is also anxious to get @entity3 's season up and running this weekend			1
the @entity82 have lost all three of their games , with the @entity6 defeat compounding woes after last weekend 's 4 - 0 defeat by @entity87			1
@entity2 said : ' saturday is important , it 's massive for us			2
it wo n't be easy against @entity91 , that 's for sure			0
' they were a team in form at the end of last season and have started decent this year			2
we have got to pick ourselves up and get ready to go on saturday			0
' out : @entity2 watches on in disappointment as his @entity3 side crash out of the @entity14 to @entity6 the mood was considerably different at @entity6 , the modest but well - run @entity102 club who have made steady progress since promotion to the @entity106 in 2009			1
after missing out on promotion in the play - offs last season , the @entity107 have made a solid start to the new campaign and are unbeaten in six games across all competitions			1
striker @entity57 , who curled home the 77th - minute free - kick that settled the tie , said : ' everyone is buzzing			2
it 's a great win			0
we worked as hard as we could and we nicked the goal to get the win			0
' we have had the likes of @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 here and given everyone a game			0
we just work away and stick to the game plan and it is paying off			0
' when the goal went in and at full - time you could hear the roar			0
' it is great for the fans to get memories like this			0
it 's brilliant for them			0
' but these are bonuses for us			0
our main aim is obviously promotion			0
we ca n't get sidetracked from that			0
' we have to get back down on friday morning and make sure we keep our run going in the league			0
