@entity0 has grabbed all the headlines at @entity2 this season but saturday proved they also need @entity5 firing on all cylinders to have any chance of retaining the title			1
@entity5 put recent troubles behind him to score his first @entity11 goal at @entity12 this season and complete a hard - fought @entity2 comeback against opponents who literally spilled blood for their cause			1
@entity17 had taken a shock lead through @entity19 only for the champions to level quickly with a neat finish from @entity22			1
it was no doubt a relief to manager @entity23 , who knows his side had become over-reliant on @entity0 with the @entity86 scoring half of @entity2 's 24 league goals on his own			1
he will hope @entity5 's winner , which came at the end of a long week in which he helped @entity91 qualify for the @entity92 , will mark a new beginning for the player after a troubling few months in which his brother died of cancer , he fell out with a club over an alleged birthday snub and has suffered racial abuse on social media			1
' i think it was an important moment for @entity5			2
he played two games in the international break , the second one on wednesday , so maybe he was tired			0
but he had the personality and character to continue playing until the end , ' said @entity23			2
' you ca n't always analyse @entity5 on whether he has scored a goal			1
it will be impossible for it to be like last season because he is a midfielder , not a striker			0
but it is important for him to play and i think he played very well			0
' if you remember , all the players were involved in scoring goals last season			0
so it was important that today @entity0 could n't do it but @entity22 and @entity5 could			1
' with @entity122 also winning , it was vital @entity2 secured maximum points to stay only eight points behind @entity126 's men			0
but it certainly was n't easy against @entity17 who have added steel under manager @entity130 to their pleasing style			2
@entity17 had n't beaten their opponents on home soil since 1951 when sir @entity134 was prime minister			0
@entity17 striker @entity19 gave them an early first half lead against @entity2 on saturday afternoon @entity19 ( centre ) met @entity65 's through ball to put them ahead after nine minutes at the @entity12 @entity19 celebrates his goal with his @entity17 team - mates during saturday 's @entity11 clash @entity142 miles @entity2 109.2 67.9 @entity45 90 11.5 7.2 @entity5 90 11.1 6.9 @entity39 90 10.7 6.7 @entity17 110.2 68.5 @entity143 90 11.7 7.3 @entity57 90 11.3 7.1 @entity67 90 10.4 6.5 but they enjoyed the perfect start after nine minutes when nobody challenged @entity65 outside and he had time to chip a pass to @entity19 , who had run in behind @entity40 and @entity39 without them noticing			1
@entity19 controlled @entity65 's pass with his chest and had no problems slipping the ball past a stranded @entity38			1
for once , @entity0 was n't involved in the equaliser after 19 minutes			0
@entity5 began the move with a neat pass to @entity45 on the left - hand side			1
and when the @entity158 whipped a cross into the six - yard box it was @entity22 who sniffed out the chance and got their first to turn in from close range			2
it was the striker 's first goal for his club since a brace against @entity168 in august			0
the two quickfire goals created a feisty atmosphere with @entity58 deservedly going into the book for challenging @entity0 from behind			0
and @entity40 took a risk when he led with his arm and boots and knees raised high , and caught @entity60 in an aerial duel , leaving the @entity17 player dazed and bleeding profusely down the left side of his face			2
@entity60 had to be patched up on the touchline using spray and returned looking like a boxer who 'd gone 15 rounds with @entity185 , though @entity17 manager @entity130 absolved @entity40 of blame and quipped : ' it was a nasty bump but it 'll make @entity75 better - looking , the scar will do him good			2
' @entity40 seemed extra pumped - up and did find his way into the book for blocking off @entity19 after 31 minutes			1
and @entity0 was then provocatively shoved in the back off - the - ball by @entity58 and remonstrated with @entity57 about it			0
@entity22 equalised for defending @entity194 10 minutes later with a right - footed strike @entity22 ( left ) lashed home past @entity17 goalkeeper @entity56 from close range after meeting @entity45 ' cross @entity22 ( right ) is congratulated on his first half goal by fellow strike partner @entity0 @entity17 defender @entity60 ( right ) had to leave the match for treatment after being caught in the eye @entity0 ( right ) reacted furiously at one point after being fouled by @entity58 @entity0 ( centre left ) had to be restrained by his @entity2 team - mates after mistakenly believing @entity57 ( second right ) was the offender click here to view our brilliant @entity209 's move for their equaliser scored by @entity22 at that point , mr @entity75 decided he 'd had enough and gave both captains a stern talking - to in order for things to calm things down , and it worked			1
football broke out and @entity42 had a thumping 25 - yard shot tipped onto the post by @entity56			0
. then , just past the hour , it was @entity5 time			2
@entity46 's pass was backheeled into the midfielder 's path by @entity43 and his power took him past two despairing @entity17 challenges before he tucked a tidy finish under @entity56			2
still , @entity17 could have levelled late on			0
substitute @entity64 shot wide when put through by @entity19 's pass and then @entity62 's injury - time free - kick deflected off the top of the wall and went inches wide with @entity38 beaten			1
' we should have taken our chances , ' complained @entity130 , but he can be delighted with how his team have started the season			0
for @entity23 , there is no respite			0
it 's @entity240 in the @entity241 on tuesday night and this time they will need @entity242 is suspended			0
@entity17 substitute @entity64 ( right ) missed a guilt - edge chance for the visitors when he shot wide after being put through on goal @entity64 rues his big chance which could have seen @entity130 's side come away from the @entity12 with a share of the spoils			1

@entity19 gave @entity17 an early lead on nine minutes after *capitalising* on a @entity65 through ball
@entity22 equalised for the @entity11 champions 10 minutes later with a right - footed strike
@entity5 scored the decisive goal just after the hour mark for @entity23 's side
