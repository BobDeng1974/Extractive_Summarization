there is still time for more to come but with knowing nods to @entity3 , these are my top five signings made by @entity14 clubs so far this summer			0
5 ) @entity16 - @entity15 everything about this signing sings of a new era for @entity15			1
soon after paying the wages to keep @entity22 , @entity20 has again answered his critics among the @entity25 faithful by laying out some serious cash by way of £ 28million for @entity16			1
he is the first manager at the club in many years who ca n’t say the board did n’t fully back him			0
so it ’s a massive statement from @entity20 , @entity34 and all at @entity15			1
but it will be meaningless unless they make the break into the top four and / or win a trophy			0
just like when @entity16 gets in front of goal , there needs to be an end product for @entity15 after spending so much			1
you ’ve got to admire @entity34 for putting so much pressure on himself			0
knows where the net is : the young @entity55 impressed hugely while on loan at @entity25 last year 4 ) @entity58 - @entity57 some might look at this signing and think it ’s a knee - jerk reaction to a player having a good @entity62 with @entity63 , but @entity65 ’s ability was talked about widely before the tournament got underway			1
if @entity57 ’s much talked about commitment to a new attacking style is for real , then the forward should flourish			2
i ’ve seen him score with his left , his right and his head			0
he can bag a set - piece goal too , and he ’s dynamic in the box			0
it ’s a shame for the @entity57 that he will miss the start of the season with injury , but one of the key issues to any potential success could be whether he adapts to the @entity14			2
3 ) @entity28 - @entity4 how do you replace @entity85 ? it could have been a massive issue for @entity4 as they said goodbye to their record scorer - one of their best players in an incredible 10 years of success at the club – and , along with @entity93 , a huge talisman at @entity94			1
but @entity95 dealt with it superbly by bringing in @entity28			2
if it ’s true that @entity11 chose not to sign their former captain then that ’s bizarre , especially as they have allowed potential rivals @entity4 take him			1
he ’s a goalscorer and a creator , and he ’s proven in the @entity14 and in @entity102			0
you ca n’t ask for much more			0
2 ) @entity104 – @entity11 @entity105 over the long term this could be a brilliant signing			1
@entity11 could get 15 years or more out of @entity108 – it could prove to be a bargain			2
but do n’t be fooled into thinking @entity111 is a genius who could see @entity108 as a centre half when nobody else could			1
it was former @entity117 under 19 coach @entity118 who picked @entity108 at the heart of the back four for a game against @entity121 earlier this year and he was excellent			0
sadly the @entity122 have seen fit to dispense with that kind of coaching bravery and @entity118 is now helping @entity125 achieve mission impossible at @entity127			0
but @entity117 may benefit from @entity111 ’s bravery			0
slotting the teenager in at centre half at @entity131 for his debut is bold , but @entity108 was excellent , and he could solve a problem for the national team in a position where @entity136 needs help			1
capture : @entity57 pulled off something of a coup by signing @entity58 from @entity141 this season talent : the @entity63 forward was one of the standout performers at the @entity62 in @entity145 settling in nicely : @entity28 is congratulated by @entity146 after scoring against @entity147 that 'll do nicely ! @entity4 were aware that they needed someone to replace @entity150 's @entity85 not a bad start ! @entity104 won the @entity152 during his first game in an @entity11 shirt on sunday composed : the former @entity9 man played at centre half at @entity131 , here challenging @entity157 1 ) @entity29 – @entity158 it ’s down to the player himself but this has the potential to be one of the best signings in @entity158 ’s history			1
when he burst on to the scene at @entity167 , @entity29 was brilliant			2
make no mistake , he had all it takes to be as good as @entity170			0
but he did n’t continue the progress as many expected , and he ’s now hoping to be the new @entity172 , rather than the new @entity170			0
he was on the bench for the @entity178 final three years ago , but when @entity174 was rewarded with a late substitute appearance , @entity29 felt he could not continue playing under @entity176 - he felt he could n’t even speak to the manager any longer , and so he moved on			2
get used to this : new @entity158 signing @entity29 celebrates with @entity181 after scoring against @entity182 power : the @entity185 forward was lauded by @entity176 but had to move on from the @entity186 at his best @entity176 had said @entity29 was one of the few players who had a ‘ magical touch ’ , and before that @entity176 ’s predecessor with the @entity191 giants , @entity192 , called him ‘ a treasure			1
’ after picking up @entity199 last summer , and now signing @entity29 , those who doubted @entity158 ’s commitment to a change of style under @entity198 need doubt no longer			1
the commitment is there , so let ’s see what it brings on the pitch next season			0
@entity29 is 24 this month – he ’s still relatively young			2
if he can recapture the form he was showing at the @entity186 as a teenager , then it could be brilliant for all at the @entity211			0
one thing is for certain , we are about to find out if he can do it when it ’s wet and windy in @entity158			2
missing man : @entity11 's new striker @entity10 does n't make the top five despite his pedigree			1

@entity16 was signed by @entity15 for £ 28million this summer
@entity28 and @entity29 are astute captures by @entity4 and @entity158
it 's hoped @entity58 will add flair to @entity225 's @entity57
@entity104 started at centre half on his @entity11 debut
