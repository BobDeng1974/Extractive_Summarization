victims groups are outraged by a @entity1 finding that life sentences being served by two of @entity5 's most notorious rapist - murderers are ' cruel , inhuman and degrading punishment '			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were 14 and 16 respectively when they murdered 20 - year - old @entity10 at @entity11 , in @entity13 's west in 1998			1
they were sentenced to life in jail two years later			1
the crime was one of the most notorious in @entity5 history , coming just two years after the rape and murder of nurse @entity22 at @entity23 , also in western @entity13 , by five men who are also serving life sentences without the possibility of parole			1
in response to a complaint by lawyers on behalf of @entity32 and @entity8 , the @entity28 has found their sentences are in breach of @entity5 's obligations under the @entity36 on @entity37			1
@entity38 , who was 16 when he raped and murdered @entity10 in 1988			1
@entity10 was 20 when kidnapped , raped and murdered by a gang including @entity7 and @entity8 in 1988			1
murder victim @entity10 was a bank teller who had recently moved to @entity13 from @entity42 when she was kidnapped , raped and murdered in 1988			1
@entity43 was 22 when he , along with @entity7 and @entity8 , raped and murdered bank teller @entity10			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , along with three others , kidnapped ms @entity46 at knifepoint from @entity49 train station , in @entity13 's south , on september 8 , 1988			1
she was driven to a park near @entity11 where she was repeatedly raped then dumped in a lake and drowned			2
ms @entity46 , a bank teller who had only recently moved to @entity13 from @entity42 , in the state 's south , was engaged to be married			1
in sentencing , justice @entity56 said the crimes against ms @entity46 were so barbaric that @entity32 , @entity8 and @entity43 , who was 22 at the time of the murder , should die in jail			1
' to sentence people so young to a long term of imprisonment is of course a heavy task , ' @entity62 said			0
' however , the facts surrounding the commission of these crimes are so barbaric that i believe i have no alternative other than to impose upon ( these ) young prisoners , even despite their age , a life sentence			2
' so grave is the nature of this case that i recommend that none of the prisoners in the matter should ever be released			0
' almost a decade after @entity32 , @entity8 and @entity43 were sentenced , legislation was passed in @entity83 to keep them and seven other killers behind bars for the rest of their lives			2
the legislation also covered ms @entity22 's killers : @entity22 , @entity92 and @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
none of them can ever be released unless they are dying or incapacitated to a point they could not commit a crime			0
@entity22 was one of five men who raped and murdered @entity22 in 1986			2
he is serving a life sentence and never to be released			2
@entity92 is serving a life sentence for the murder of @entity22 in 1986			0
@entity95 was one of three brothers who along with two others raped and murdered nurse @entity22			2
@entity108 is serving a life sentence for the rape and murder of @entity22			0
@entity112 , his brothers @entity94 and @entity95 , as well as @entity22 and @entity92 raped and killed @entity22 in 1986			0
none of them will ever be released			0
the @entity1 committee found that because the @entity32 and @entity8 sentences allowed no genuine chance of release , even with full rehabilitation , @entity5 was in was in breach of the pair 's human rights			1
the committee found sentences imposed on children must allow for ' the possibility of review and a prospect of release , notwithstanding the gravity of the crime and the circumstances around it '			0
" this does not mean that release should necessarily be granted			0
it rather means that release should not be a mere theoretical possibility and that the review procedure should be a thorough one			0
' the @entity139 reported @entity10 's family was horrified by the decision , which is not enforceable			1
the family wants @entity32 , @entity8 and @entity43 to die in jail			1
' they knew what they were doing , " @entity147 said of his sister 's killers			2
' they should stay where they are			0
they have nothing to offer society			0
' there have been a ridiculous amount of appeals already , including to the @entity159			0
each one has been rejected and each one has caused this family a huge amount of pain			0
' just when you think it 's over , it 's on again			0
' @entity168 , president of the @entity169 , said it was ' absurd ' that the @entity1 would interfere in the punishment handed to murderers in @entity5			1
' @entity10 was a completely innocent person who had the misfortune to be picked up and indescribably raped and tortured by these low lives , ' mr @entity168 told @entity176			1
' and yet they are crying out for help now when they made sure that @entity180 was in no position to receive any help at any stage			0
' mr @entity168 said @entity180 's mother @entity184 , who died last year , would be horrifed by the findings			0
' @entity184 , who was a lovely , lovely lady , would be absolutely mortified at ( outside interference ) into the punishment of the low lives that took away her daughter 's life			2
' @entity191 senior lawyer @entity190 , who represented @entity7 and @entity8 before the @entity1 , said the decision questioned the legality of a system that did allow for consideration of rehabilitation			2
' no one is questioning the terrible nature of the crimes committed , but an effective and lawful response to children committing such crimes requires more than simply locking them up and throwing away the key , ' she said .			0

@entity10 was raped and murdered in @entity13 's west in 1988
