warm , woolly jumpers are a staple in most people ’s winter wardrobe			0
the very essence of eco-friendly fashion , they conjure images of fields filled with contented sheep — a quintessentially @entity11 scene			1
the use of wool is even encouraged by the @entity14 , patron of the global @entity15			2
although the unethical production of luxury fabrics such as cashmere and angora has ( quite rightly ) come under fire — thanks to distressing evidence of goats packed into atrocious factory farms , like battery hens , and live rabbits having their fur ripped out of their skin — sheep - shearing has always been deemed a pretty benign process			1
an undercover video filmed by animal rights campaigners shows sheep being hit , kicked , stabbed and stamped on by men shearing them at high speed			1
the footage was filmed in 30 farms across the @entity48 and @entity49 — the largest exporter of wool in the world , with the @entity54 and @entity55 rag trades its biggest markets			1
the @entity14 ( pictured ) has encouraged the use of wool , and is a patron of the @entity59 since these countries manufacture cheap jumpers for the @entity11 market , it ’s an issue that feeds directly into the @entity11 @entity64			1
and , says @entity65 , who made the film , it is the tip of a very large , disturbing iceberg			0
‘ the investigators recorded shearers as they violently punched struggling sheep and beat and jabbed them in the face with sharp shears , ’ says @entity65 spokesperson @entity68			2
‘ these routine attacks leave the animals bleeding from their eyes , nose and mouth			0
’ these revelations come on top of a long , unsuccessful campaign to ban another cruel practice in @entity49 sheep farms called mulesing — in which a portion of skin is carved from the sheep ’s backside using shears , usually without anaesthetic , to prevent ‘ flystrike ’ , a deadly infestation of maggots			1
brands from @entity95 to @entity96 have rejected wool that comes from mulesed sheep , demanding other methods of avoiding flystrike , and @entity101 has banned it altogether , yet @entity49 ’s wool board has delayed plans to phase out the practice			1
most sheep are bred for meat with wool as a by - product , even if the fleeces are not taken directly from a carcass almost all @entity113 wool — from an ancient breed of hardy sheep — on the @entity64 comes from @entity49 and @entity101 , including anything labelled with the @entity118 logo , and unless a brand states its opposition to mulesing , it is likely to have been subject to the practice			1
@entity122 , welfare development manager for the organisation @entity123 , is outraged by it , saying : ‘ it is unacceptable that sheep should be roughly handled , thrown around , punched , kicked or hit with sharp or blunt metal objects			1
’ even the @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , the organisation through which , by law , almost all @entity11 fleece wool must be sold , is adamant such behaviour is unacceptable			1
‘ i ’m 61 , i ’ve been in the shearing industry all my life , and i have never seen sheep treated that way , ’ says @entity132 ’s shearing training manager @entity134			0
@entity140 sheep farmer and wool producer , @entity141 ( pictured ) uses wool from sheep that have been rescued from slaughter for her luxury brand @entity146 ‘ in the @entity11 that would never happen			1
here , when we teach young shearers it ’s about respect for the animal , and keeping it calm is all in the hold			0
i think i can speak for every farmer in the @entity11 : their animals are their pride and joy			2
’ the problem , though , is that there ’s no way of knowing what you are buying			0
your wool could be from @entity54 — where intensive farming is on the up , and which is now the second largest producer in the world — or from @entity49 or even @entity167 , the ninth largest producer			1
unless it is marked as @entity11 , you can have no clue			2
@entity65 spokesman , @entity68 ( pictured ) said ‘ the investigators recorded shearers as they violently punched struggling sheep and beat and jabbed them in the face with sharp shears ’ ‘ people are able to make informed choices about their meat and know how the animal has been raised , ’ says ethical sheep farmer and wool producer , @entity141			1
‘ yet when it comes to wool , they are given no information			0
have the sheep been sheared then live - exported and traded round the globe before being slaughtered ? there is simply no way of knowing			0
’ she uses wool from sheep rescued from slaughter and allowed to live out their days happily in her fields for her luxury brand , @entity146 , and has been trying with little luck to persuade the @entity132 to introduce a premium wool label that takes account of welfare standards			2
‘ humane , slaughter - free wool is achievable at an industrial level , ’ she insists			0
‘ not at @entity205 prices — there is inevitably a premium			0
but increasing numbers are turning their backs on fast fashion in favour of buying less and more ethically			0
’ model @entity212 's company , @entity211 , works with luxury brand @entity146 a number of companies do make the effort to source more ethically produced wool			0
@entity11 brands @entity220 and @entity221 offer full traceability on all their fabrics , including @entity226 wool from a non-mulesed flock , and , in @entity221 ’s case , rare @entity230 sheep in @entity231			1
the model @entity212 ’s company @entity211 works with @entity146 , and @entity234 has exclusive @entity11 rights to @entity237 wool — an @entity226 producer that claims to have the happiest sheep in the world			1
if you ’re vegetarian , be under no illusions , though : most sheep are bred for meat , and wool is a by - product , even if the fleeces are not taken directly from a carcass			2
@entity122 , ( pictured ) welfare development manager for the organisation @entity123 , is outraged by @entity65 's video revealing cruel practices in wool shearing			2
‘ the great thing about wool is that it ’s sustainable fibre , ’ says @entity134			0
‘ it ’s not reliant on oil and it ’s a fibre that keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer			0
it ’s one of the greenest fibres there ever will be			0
’ a biodegradable , breathable fibre with no petrochemicals ? sounds like a dream — if only there was some easy way to know just what you ’re getting when you buy your jumper .			0
