professor @entity32 , who carried out the study on the effects of low - level alcohol in pregnancy – the first of its kind in the @entity23 – said : ‘ if women drink just one unit of alcohol , the baby ’s breathing and movement stop for up to two hours after that			1
that ’s not normal – the baby should be continually active			0
’ the professor , from @entity49 , looked at 18 - week scans of pregnant women who drank on average two - and - a - half units a week – equivalent to a 200ml glass of wine			1
