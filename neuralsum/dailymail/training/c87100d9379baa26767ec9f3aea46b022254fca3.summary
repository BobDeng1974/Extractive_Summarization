summer weddings present all manner of sartorial dilemmas			0
is your outfit demure enough for church ? will your dress upstage the bride 's ? should you or should you not wear a hat ? and having decided on a hat , how do you pick one that makes you look like @entity18 at @entity19 and not @entity20 at the garden fete ? now , a website has devised a test to determine which sort of hat best suits you			2
@entity26 has launched a service called if the hat fits - a simple program that ' promises to find you the perfect millinery match '			2
after answering a series of questions about face shape , eye colour , hairline and the event in question , if the @entity32 will offer a solution : be it a pillbox , feather fascinator or something extravagant			1
whether you 're putting together a wedding outfit or trying to decide on your race day accessories for 2013 , taking your face shape into consideration when choosing a hat can help you maintain a look that 's as well - balanced as it is stylish			1
the site allows you to accessorise to suit this , but it needs a few tweaks			0
it could have been the ultimate problem solver to spare the humiliation of turning up in an outlandish hat , in the style of the one princess @entity1 so memorably wore to the royal wedding two years ago ( not unlike a loo seat with antlers )			1
but perhaps if the app had let you upload a picture of yourself and posed real hat solutions you can actually buy - it could have been the perfect style aid			1
your face shape is determined by the proportion of the different sections of your face , and there are two easy ways to measure these			1
the middle of your forehead or at the widest point			0
the top of your cheekbones			0
your jaw line at the widest point			0
the tip of your hairline to the bottom of your chin			0
draw an outline of your face on a mirror : with a make - up liner , place dots on the top of your hairline , your temples , your jaw line and the bottom of your chinto find your defining points			0
compare your results to the descriptions to see which one of the seven best fits your face shape			1
choose face shape choosing a round shaped face as this most closely matched measurements 2			2
choose eye colour the next step is choosing eye colour to determine suitable shades ( but what about the outfit ? ) 3			2
choose occasion with four occasions to choose from , we have a wedding coming up and so went for the first option 4 : the hat ... this hat fits ? i do n't own anything green and even if i wanted the head gear - where would i find it ? plus it did n't take into account my long blonde hair			1
would i wear it up or down ?			0

promising site launches app to help spare you princess @entity1 *disaster*
lets you select face shape , eye colour and occasion for ' perfect fit '
does n't consider hair shade or style , nor lets you upload picture
fails to offer hat option that actually exists and you can buy
