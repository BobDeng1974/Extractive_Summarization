@entity0 became the first man ever to make three test centuries in his first three innings as captain and @entity5 made the first of his career as @entity8 fought back on day three of the fourth test against @entity10 at @entity11			1
the hosts had declared on 572 on day two but @entity8 produced a brilliant response to reach 342 for five , a deficit of 230 , with @entity0 hitting his fourth ton of the series as the pair put on 141 for the third wicket			1
@entity5 had reached 110 when he was dismissed in just his second match while @entity0 , in his first match as full - time skipper following the shock resignation of @entity23 , was undefeated on 140			2
video confusion in the sky as @entity26 spills catch and blames spidercam @entity0 celebrates and acknowledges the crowd after scoring a century for @entity8 against @entity10 @entity0 raises his bat in the air as he reaches his century on day three of the fourth test in @entity11 @entity8 's @entity5 looks towards the sky as he celebrates his century against @entity10 @entity8 began the day on 71 for one and made slow progress in the early stages , adding just 12 runs in the first 10 overs			1
despite the slow going , @entity40 brought up his half - century off 132 balls but was gone to the next one he faced as he edged a @entity43 delivery onto the stumps to depart for 53			0
a major talking point then came three overs before lunch when @entity5 did not get hold of a pull off @entity49 and the ball went flying into the air with @entity26 looking certain to make the catch			0
the stand - in captain , though , spilled the opportunity and instantly pointed to the sky , suggesting the ball may have hit the ' spider - cam ' system of camera wires above the pitch			0
both @entity61 and the @entity63 broadcasters later confirmed that was not the case but admitted @entity26 had been ' distracted by one of the wires in his eye line ' and the fielder looked furious to have spilled the opener on 46			0
@entity8 captain @entity0 hits a shot on his way to a ton at the @entity11 @entity10 captain @entity26 drops a catch off @entity75 @entity5 on day three @entity26 looks skywards and points towards the spider - cam after dropping a catch a general view of the @entity11 on thursday shows the spider - cam above the field of play the rate did not pick up a great deal after the interval but the batsmen were clearly comfortable in the middle , finding the boundary with anything loose , and @entity5 moved into the 90s with a six off @entity90			1
@entity0 then reached his half - century before the new ball was taken and @entity92 almost had the skipper through the gate first ball but it took a slight inside edge and went to the rope			2
@entity26 then put down another chance but this time he had nobody to blame but himself as @entity0 got on an edge to a @entity92 ball and it flew high to second slip where @entity26 spilled the opportunity above his head			2
more drama was to come before tea as @entity5 , who had recorded scores of three and one on debut in @entity111 , brought up his maiden @entity113 ton off 253 balls as he guided the ball to the rope past gully			0
@entity63 bowler @entity49 ( second right ) celebrates after claiming the wicket of @entity119 @entity10 captain smith ( right ) presents his pink cap to @entity122 on @entity123 day in @entity11 @entity63 prime minister @entity124 enjoys a drink as he watches the action in @entity11 the crowd , many of whom are wearing pink , cheer during day three of the fourth test his joy was short lived , however , as in just the second over after tea he was gone , pulling a @entity92 delivery high into the air and the bowler claimed the catch himself at the batsman 's end			1
that seemed to prompt @entity0 to want to race to his century and the right - hander joined counterpart @entity26 in making it four for the series off 162 balls			2
it had very much been the tourists ' day so far but @entity49 changed the complexion slightly with two wickets in as many balls in the 100th over			0
first @entity152 was trapped in front for 13 and then @entity119 edged to @entity154 , who made an impressive catch diving to his left			0
that could have had @entity8 wobbling but @entity0 and @entity158 ( 14 not out ) made it through to the close with the former becoming the top @entity75 run - scorer in a series in @entity10 .			1

@entity0 is the first man to score three test centuries in his first three innings as captain
