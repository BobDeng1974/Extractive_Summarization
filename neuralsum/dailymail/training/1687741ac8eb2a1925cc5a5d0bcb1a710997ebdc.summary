looking uncannily like a giant eye in the sky , the @entity0 has been captured in stunning new detail by a @entity5 space telescope			1
the breathtaking image shows a dying star is throwing a ' cosmic tantrum '			1
it shows the star 's dusty outer layers unraveling into space , glowing from the intense ultraviolet radiation being pumped out by the hot stellar core			1
looking uncannily like a giant eye in the sky , the @entity0 nebula lies 650 light - years away , in the constellation of @entity19			0
the image shows the death of a star in the @entity0 650 light years from earth			1
it is made from images from three telescopes			0
@entity27 has picked out the ultraviolet light pouring out of this system , shown throughout the nebula in blue , while @entity32 has snagged the detailed infrared signature of the dust and gas in yellow			0
a portion of the extended field beyond the nebula , which was not observed by @entity32 , is from @entity5 's all - sky @entity40 ( @entity40 )			1
the brighter purple circle in the very center is the combined ultraviolet and infrared glow of a dusty disk circling the white dwarf			0
the combined image was taken by @entity5 's @entity49 and the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , which @entity5 has lent to the @entity50 in @entity51			1
this object , called the @entity0 , lies 650 light - years away , in the constellation of @entity19			0
also known by the catalog number @entity0 , it is a typical example of a class of objects called planetary nebulae			0
discovered in the 18th century , these cosmic works of art were erroneously named for their resemblance to gas - giant planets			0
planetary nebulae are actually the remains of stars that once looked a lot like our sun. these stars spend most of their lives turning hydrogen into helium in massive runaway nuclear fusion reactions in their cores			1
in fact , this process of fusion provides all the light and heat that we get from our sun. our sun will blossom into a planetary nebula when it dies in about five billion years			0
when the hydrogen fuel for the fusion reaction runs out , the star turns to helium for a fuel source , burning it into an even heavier mix of carbon , nitrogen and oxygen			1
eventually , the helium will also be exhausted , and the star dies , puffing off its outer gaseous layers and leaving behind the tiny , hot , dense core , called a white dwarf			1
the white dwarf is about the size of @entity99 , but has a mass very close to that of the original star ; in fact , a teaspoon of a white dwarf would weigh as much as several elephants			2
the glow from planetary nebulae is particularly intriguing as it appears surprisingly similar across a broad swath of the spectrum , from ultraviolet to infrared			0
the @entity0 remains recognizable at any of these wavelengths , but the combination shown here highlights some subtle differences			0
the image is eerily reminiscent of the @entity117 from the @entity119 films			0
the intense ultraviolet radiation from the white dwarf heats up the expelled layers of gas , which shine brightly in the infrared			2
@entity27 has picked out the ultraviolet light pouring out of this system , shown throughout the nebula in blue , while @entity32 has snagged the detailed infrared signature of the dust and gas in yellow			0
a portion of the extended field beyond the nebula , which was not observed by @entity32 , is from @entity5 's all - sky @entity40 ( @entity40 )			1
the white dwarf star itself is a tiny white pinprick right at the center of the nebula			2
the brighter purple circle in the very center is the combined ultraviolet and infrared glow of a dusty disk circling the white dwarf ( the disk itself is too small to be resolved )			0
this dust was most likely kicked up by comets that survived the death of their star			2
before the star died , its comets , and possibly planets , would have orbited the star in an orderly fashion			2
when the star ran out of hydrogen to burn , and blew off its outer layers , the icy bodies and outer planets would have been tossed about and into each other , kicking up an ongoing cosmic dust storm			1
any inner planets in the system would have burned up or been swallowed as their dying star expanded			1
infrared data from @entity32 for the central nebula is rendered in green ( wavelengths of 3.6 to 4.5 microns ) and red ( 8 to 24 microns ) , with @entity40 data covering the outer areas in green ( 3.4 to 4.5 microns ) and red ( 12 to 22 microns )			2
ultraviolet data from @entity27 appears as blue ( 0.15 to 2.3 microns )			0
@entity5 has previously released this image , dubbed the ' eye of sauron ' which also appears to be an eye , showing the spiral galaxy @entity181 ,			1
