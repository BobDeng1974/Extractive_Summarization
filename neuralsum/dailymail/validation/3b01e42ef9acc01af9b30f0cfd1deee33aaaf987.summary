@entity5 ’s watch does what @entity1 and @entity2 ’s smartwatch failed at - create a beautiful , elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery , without even switching it on			1
surprisingly light , the watch oozes quality and attention to detail in the design and build			1
@entity5 has gone to great lengths to show off the specialist materials used to make it , and it shows			0
' it creates a beautiful , elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery , without even switching it on			0
' while in images it looks a little chunky , on the wrist it is a different story			1
the rounded curve means it fits comfortably on the wrist , and the range of bracelets means there ’s one for pretty much every taste			2
for the record , i used the leather strap with magnetic ‘ slap band ’ on the @entity40 model , and also tested the @entity41			1
using the watch can be slightly confusing at first - the combination of digital crown , button and touchscreen mean that for your first few tries , you ’ll probably press the wrong one			1
however , after a few minutes it becomes second nature to navigate around , and the digital crown in particular is perfectly weighted , making scrolling through long lists - such as music or your messages - simple			1
the touchscreen in particular is extremely accurate			1
i did n’t notice a single press in the wrong place , even on the main screen which has dozens of icons			2
we were able to try its features , and found even in the beta version we were using , the software is spot on - animation are smooth and fluid , with watch faces such as an opening rose showing off the screen however , there is undoubtedly an initial confusion factor @entity5 will have to overcome			1
the experience of buying one in @entity5 ’s stores will be key to its success , as the watch simply is n’t a device you can just pick up and understand instantly			2
however , once you know how to get around , the watch is fluid , fast and the screen astonishingly bright			1
we were able to try all of its features , and found even in the beta version we were using , the software is spot on - animations are smooth and fluid , with watch faces really showing off the screen			1
overall , the @entity93 is by far the best wearable device on the market			0
sadly , this is no indicator of success as there ’s simply not much in the way of competition for the ‘ normal ’ consumer , despite @entity103 ’s attempts with @entity104			0
@entity5 has taken the @entity106 software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch 's power , display size and functions			1
it has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read however , will people want one ? overall , the selling point from my ( admittedly short ) time with the watch seems to be its time - saving potential - as a phone addict , i ’m constantly checking for messages			1
having that on my wrist , along with the ability to easily reply and to see , will make the process faster			2
as with the @entity5 phone when it was first introduced , one feels we are only seeing @entity5 ’s apps in any detail			0
when it ships on april 24th , developers around the world are expected to unleash a raft of apps			0
much like the @entity135 , these are what could really propel @entity5 watch from being an elegant way to see your notifications , to being a true new computing platform @entity5 hopes it will be			2
on first impressions , it seems @entity5 has a very good chance of once again changing the way we interact with technology			0
the @entity5 watch is available in three models : the @entity93 , @entity40 ( pictured ) and @entity5 watch edition models : the @entity93 will be available in three models : the @entity93 , watch sport and watch edition			1

gestures : following last year 's unveiling , @entity5 admitted the watch is unlike any device it has ever made			1
it said it has ' reinvented all - new ways to select navigate and input that are suited to a smaller device worn on the wrist '			1
the watch is also said to be able to sense force adding ' a new dimension to the user interface '			2
@entity198 uses electrodes around the flexible display to distinguish between a light tap and a deep press , and trigger instant access to a range of contextually specific controls - such as an action menu in messages , or a mode that lets you select different watch faces			1
the @entity40 model is pictured left , the watch is pictured centre and the edition is pictured right			1
all of the watches can be pre-ordered from 10 april and will be available in stores from this date @entity218 : on mechanical watches , the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring			1
@entity5 has adapted this and its ' digital ' crown can be used to magnify content on the small display			2
rotating the digital crown replaces the typical pinching motion used on iphones and @entity231 and allows wearers to zoom and scroll without obstructing the screen			2
pressing the crown will also return wearers to the home screen			2
watch os : @entity5 has taken the @entity106 software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch 's power , display size and functions			1
it has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read			0
on mechanical watches the crown has historically been used to set the time and date and to wind the mainspring			1
@entity5 has adapted this and its ' digital ' crown ( pictured ) can be used to magnify content on the display			2
rotating the crown replaces allows wearers to zoom and scroll without obstructing the screen @entity260 display : @entity261 have a laminated retina display made from a ' single crystal of sapphire			2
' while on the @entity40 collection the screen has the added protection of @entity161 glass			1
glances : the @entity269 feature shows info users would like to see , similar to @entity272 , and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom			0
for instance , wearers can glimpse the weather forecast , check out what ’s next on their calendar , or find their location on a map			0
they can then swipe through different glances , or tap on one to go directly to its corresponding app for more details			0
music can also be controlled on an @entity135 through the @entity93			0
on the back of the watch 's case is a sensor ( pictured ) that uses infrared and visible - light leds and photodiodes to detect the wearer 's heart rate vibration and notifications : @entity289 has a built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications			1
any notification that appears on the connected phone will appear on the watch			2
this is made from a linear actuator , or motor , inside the @entity5 watch that produces haptic feedback			0
the wearer can then respond to these messages directly or swipe down to see the @entity313			0
this haptic feedback could also be used with @entity315 , for example , to help people navigate			0
it will produced gentle vibrations to signal when to turn left or right			0
@entity289 additionally understands questions in messages and offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the @entity135			0
and this taptic engine means people can get someone 's attention with a gentle tap or send their heartbeat remotely			0
there is no keyboard on the watch , and messages can only be sent through dictation , or emoji			0
@entity335 is also built into the @entity93			0
heart rate sensor : on the back of the watch 's case , a ceramic cover with sapphire lenses sits above a sensor that uses infrared and visible - light leds and photodiodes to detect the wearer 's heart rate			1
@entity93 uses this sensor , along with an accelerometer and the gps and @entity350 in a connected @entity135 , to measure physical movement such as steps , distance and calories			0
inductive charging : the watch uses @entity5 's @entity358 technology with inductive charging			1
this means it can be charged wirelessly by placing a connector near the back of the watch where magnets cause it to snap into place automatically			0
@entity358 is the name of the connector @entity5 uses with its @entity368 range			0
battery life : mr @entity370 was vague about the battery life of the @entity5 watch when it was announced			0
he confirmed last month that it will last a full day after initially saying it will need to be charged overnight .			0

we tested the @entity40 model and the @entity376
while in images they look chunky , on the wrist they feel much lighter
the watch 's crown , button and touchscreen can be confusing at first
but the touchscreen is accurate , easy to use and astonishingly bright
the watch 's main selling point seems to be its time - saving potential
