if you 've ever wondered what it 's like to stand on the surface of an alien world , drink in these breathtaking pictures of the surface of @entity7			1
these incredible panoramas have been stitched together by amateur enthusiasts from images sent back from the @entity7 by @entity12 's @entity11			1
the interplanetary probe is currently investigating the @entity14 , which sits just south of the @entity7 equator			2
the mist - obscured mountains in the background are likely to be its outer rim			0
it is a mosaic assembled from four separate colour images			0

mr @entity23 , an astronomy writer and outreach teacher who describes himself as a ' frustrated @entity7 ' , said : ' finally a spaceprobe takes a pic that shows @entity7 as it has burned in my mind all these years			0
' the second image was compiled by @entity38 , a blogger for @entity39 , from three separate images taken by @entity11 nearly two weeks ago			2
@entity41 morning : @entity38 , a blogger for @entity39 , created this mosaic image from three separate images taken by @entity11 nearly two weeks ago ' there is no sky visible in this view , ' she notes			2
' occupying the distance is @entity14 's crater rim			2

yesterday it emerged that scientists testing the lasers on @entity11 have discovered rocks with startling similarities to a matter found on @entity57			2
researchers expected the substance to contain the same minerals as rocks found elsewhere on the @entity7 , but instead learned it was chemically more akin to an unusual type found on @entity57			0
the make - up of the rock is similar to one found on oceanic islands like @entity67 and @entity68 , as well as in continental rift zones like the @entity70 , which extends from @entity71 to @entity72 , @entity73			1
@entity74 : this image shows where the @entity11 aimed two instruments to study a rock known as @entity79 referring to rock formed from molten material , @entity11 scientist @entity82 , from the @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 , said : ' it was a bit of a surprise , what we found with this rock			2
but it seems to be a new kind of rock type that we encountered on @entity7			0
' @entity11 arrived on @entity7 two months ago to learn if the most @entity57 - like planet in the solar system was suitable for microbial life			1
exploring another world : pictures taken by @entity11 's camera shows fine sand taken from the surface of @entity7 @entity12 named the rock after the late engineer @entity105 , who was the surface operations systems chief engineer for @entity106 and the project 's @entity11			1
he passed away on august 20 , at age 64 and was a leading engineer for all of the previous @entity12 @entity7 rovers : @entity111 last month , @entity11 's laser was used to zap the football - sized rock and the rover analysed the pulverised material , as well as tiny pits left behind , to determine its chemical composition			1
scientists found the rock lacks magnesium and iron - elements found in igneous rock examined by previous @entity7 rovers @entity125			1
the rock , named after a @entity128 rover engineer , @entity79 , who died shortly after @entity11 's landing , was also rich in feldspar - like minerals , which provided clues about the rock 's history			1
geologist @entity134 , from the @entity135 in @entity136 , compared the make - up of the rock to how hard apple cider was partially frozen in big barrels during the winter in colonial times			1
he said : ' the way in which this type of rock forms ... is like how applejack liquor was made			0
you 'd crystallise out ice and you 'd make more and more and more concentrated apple - flavored liquor			0
' @entity153 inside a planet can undergo a similar process , he added , saying it takes very particular conditions on @entity57 to produce this type of magma			0
@entity134 said : ' you melt the interior and it comes to the surface and , just like the applejack , when you cool it , it crystallizes			0
' meanwhile , the rover has moved on to testing and cleaning of its soil scoop			0
eventually , scientists want to funnel soil samples to @entity11 's onboard laboratory for more extensive chemical analysis			1
the rover is part way to its first science target , an area known as @entity174 , which has three different types of rock intersecting			0
the car - sized @entity11 landed inside a giant impact basin called @entity14 , located near the @entity7 equator , for a two - year , $ 2.5billion astrobiology mission , @entity12 's first since the @entity183 - era @entity182 probes			1
video : @entity12 update on @entity11 's mission on @entity7			1

images of @entity7 have been stitched together by amateur enthusiasts
they show the vista as seen by @entity11 as it *trundles* about in the planet 's @entity14
scientists have found chemical make - up of the @entity7 rock is the same as ones found in @entity67 and @entity68
