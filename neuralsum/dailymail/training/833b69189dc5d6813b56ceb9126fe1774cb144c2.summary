to all of those closest to him and , indeed , those who thought they knew him best , @entity0 was the happy - go - lucky , ' nothing gets me down ' surfer dude			1
but that ' could not have been further from the truth '			0
three years ago , as bipolar consumed his life , the now 33 - year - old found himself at his lowest ebb			1
he no longer cared for the beautiful eastern @entity14 beaches he 'd called home since moving across the ditch from @entity17			1
' mate , all i know is that i tried to run away from it and one day , i 'm not exactly sure how i got there either , but i was sitting alone in a hotel room in @entity22 and in a very dark place , ' he admitted			0
' i was stuck there just thinking about ways of ending it , i was manic and had lost all sense of everything and decided to walk in front of a car			0
in the end , i never did that			0
' instead , i called my brother ... and you know that conversation probably changed my life			2
' surfing away the blues			0
@entity38 has come up with a novel way of trying to beat @entity40 , the same disorder he shares with his father the family connection to this story does n't end there			2
@entity0 returned home to @entity47 in the @entity48 to discuss his mental health issues with his father , only to find out that 64 - year - old @entity50 had , just like his son , been diagnosed with bipolar disorder a few years earlier			1
' again , no one knew but apparently he had it from a very young age '			0
his personal and private battle has led to him starting @entity57 friday , helping surfers of all abilities realise how catching one wave can improve your mood			0
the @entity63 are most definitely a family affair with @entity0 's mum @entity65 and his dad @entity66 among those joining the fun and frivolity to help raise awareness bipolar symptoms vary but those with the disorder can experience periods of over-excitement and recklessness , as well as suffering low self - esteem , feeling helpless and being depressed			1
' i went from being the life of the party to being completely down and depressed and often found myself behaving in a totally irrational , risky manner , ' @entity0 admitted			1
surfers of all shapes and sizes come out to play to send a very serious message on ' @entity63 ' ' i knew there was a problem one day when i stopped midway through my speech at an event , i broke down and just walked out			2
i sought help but was actually misdiagnosed as suffering depression			0
' ultimately i spent 10 days in hospital and they found out what the real cause was			0
' bipolar will affect up to 460,000 @entity96 at some point in their life and those afflicted with the disorder tend to have a higher rate of relationship problems , accidental injuries and , in the worst cases , suicide			1
significantly , more than half of all sufferers will turn to drugs or alcohol at an outlet			2
' i was working for a tequila company at the time - in hindsight probably not a good combination for someone with bipolar , was it ? ' there are no rules on ' @entity63 ' wherever they are held , all @entity0 wants is to ' put a smile on your face ' after a close friend confided in @entity0 , that he too was bipolar , ' i just decided one day to just throw on a suit and tie and hit the water and when my mate @entity124 ( @entity125 ) joined me a couple of weeks later we decided to call it our board meeting			1
from there it just took off '			0
the so - called ' board meetings ' morphed into ' @entity63 ' and @entity0 and friends went on to establish @entity134 , a not - for - profit surf group whose main focus is to raise awareness of mental health matters			1
' it 's a simple recipe really - saltwater , surfing , good mates and of course some crazy coloured get - ups - the more colourful , the better , ' he said			2
' we have a saying that one wave is all it takes , to get you smiling and to give you hope			0
' and if it gets just one more person talking about their problems , then we 've succeeded			0
' at sunrise each friday , dozens of surfers don the fluro colours at @entity14 beaches like @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 and further north , including @entity158 and @entity159			2
' @entity63 ' fever has taken off internationally too ; including beaches in @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity17 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity22			1
@entity0 says it does n't matter if you 're a surfer , footy player or office worker ' sometimes it 's okay not to be okay '			1

both @entity0 and his dad @entity66 suffer bipolar disorder
in his darkest moments the @entity17 - born surfer admits he thought ' there was only one way out '
groups at beaches along the east coast of @entity96 and internationally are supporting the not - for - profit *charity* @entity0 founded called @entity134
a bit of fun 2 years ago has morphed from the then ' board meetings ' to ' @entity63 '
@entity189 disorder will affect up to 460,000 @entity96 at some point in their lives
almost half of all @entity96 will suffer some form of mental illness
