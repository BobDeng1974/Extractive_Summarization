by @entity0 and @entity1 before relocating his family from @entity3 to @entity4 last year to work in a clinic trying to help contain the ebola virus epidemic - where he inevitably caught the incurable and highly - deadly disease - dr. @entity8 gave a sermon in his hometown explaining his decision			1
the religious reasons for the missionary trip have been revealed as the @entity15 said the father - of - two ' seems to be improving ' , 24 hours after landing in @entity17 from @entity18 on saturday for treatment			1
@entity8 was transferred amid high security to @entity21 in @entity22 , which is fitted out with one of the most sophisticated containment facilities in @entity25			1
he was pictured being helped out of a special ambulance in a hazmat suit and walking into the hospital			0
@entity30 chief @entity29 told @entity31 on @entity32 on sunday they hope @entity8 will ' continue to improve ' , but could not say whether they think he will survive the virus			2
' when patients are exposed to @entity42 but not sick , they can not infect others ... our understanding is that they did not have contact with him when he was sick , ' @entity29 told @entity32			2
before @entity8 went to @entity18 last october , he returned to his hometown of @entity63 and gave a sermon at the @entity65 , which has been obtained by @entity66			1
' for two years we will live and work and serve among the people who , until the last 10 years of peace , had known nothing but the violence and devastation of war for the previous 20 years , ' @entity8 told the congregation			2
' i 've never been to @entity18			2
' ( i 'm going ) because @entity76 has a call on my life			0
' ' on difficult days , when i want to give up or when i wonder if i 've made the right decision , retelling my story reminds me of how @entity76 has brought me to where i am			0
' @entity8 was able to meet with his wife , @entity83 , in protective conditions for 45 minutes after arriving in the country on saturday , @entity82 reported			2
she said he was in ' great spirits and extremely grateful ' to be home according to a statement released on her behalf by the @entity92 charity @entity91			0
the doctor 's sister , mother and father are also at the hospital and it was a ' relief to welcome him home ' , they said via the charity			2
@entity25 officials are confident that @entity8 and a second patient - aid worker @entity102 , who is expected to arrive in @entity22 on tuesday - can be treated without putting the public in any danger			1
the specialized unit at @entity21 where the two will be contained was opened a dozen years ago to care for federal health workers exposed to some of the world 's most dangerous germs			2
arrived : dr. @entity8 , who caught @entity42 at a treatment clinic in @entity113 , @entity18 , has been evacuated to the @entity25 for treatment landed : an airplane carrying @entity25 doctor @entity8 who has the ebola virus , arrives at @entity52 in @entity17 , @entity17 , on august 2 , 2014 fight of their lives : dr. @entity8 ( left ) and hygienist aid worker @entity102 are both in grave conditions as they battle incurable @entity42 this is a glimpse inside the containment ward at @entity21 where the two @entity25 @entity42 patients will be cared for after they arrive in the @entity25 now it 's being pressed into service for the two seriously ill @entity25 who worked at a hospital in @entity18 , one of the three @entity4 countries hit by the largest @entity42 outbreak in history			1
@entity15 director dr @entity29 acknowledged that many @entity25 are terrified about bringing dr @entity8 and hygienist @entity102 back to the @entity25 to continue the treatment of their incurable ebola infections but insisted there was no risk			1
' but i really hope that people 's fear wo n't outweigh their compassion			0
we 've got a real challenge in @entity4 and what we need to focus on is stopping the outbreak there			0
we will be able to stop it , but its going to take supporting people , ' he told @entity39			0
' and that means if people who are on that supporting mission get sick , we care for them			0
' dr @entity29 added : ' @entity42 is a huge risk in @entity4			1
it 's not going to be a huge risk in the @entity25 ' according to @entity155 , @entity21 's isolation unit is on the ground floor and has three beds with the highest standards in negative pressure air handling , @entity161 filtration and exhaust			1
' when this unit was being built , we hoped we 'd never have to use the space to treat a serious communicable disease , ' said @entity21 epidemiologist @entity167			0
special jet : the plane carrying the two @entity42 sufferers is designed to transport very ill patients long distances under constant medical care containment : inside the jet , the patients will be quarantined in these isolation tents called aeromedical biological containment systems the custom - designed jet left @entity22 for @entity18 on thursday efforts have been made to help the two patients with the means available in @entity18 - and just hours before the flight to @entity22 was revealed , father - of - two @entity8 gave up the single vial of an experimental treatment sent over from the @entity25 in order that @entity102 - a grandmother and longtime christian missionary - could receive it instead			1
@entity8 received a transfusion of the blood of a 14 - year - old @entity42 survivor who he personally helped to treat			1
giving blood transfusions from survivors to still suffering @entity42 patients is an established , though not nearly proven , treatment for the largely untreatable disease			0
however , on thursday charity @entity197 said in a statement that mrs @entity102 's condition had worsened , despite the serum			1
her husband , @entity201 , is close by but can only visit his wife through a window or dressed in a haz - mat suit			0
' we continue to pray for @entity102 's full and complete recovery , ' said @entity207 , president of @entity208			2
' even though her condition has worsened , we know she is receiving the best possible medical care , and we are thankful that she has access to this experimental drug			0
' we believe in the power of prayer and ask people around the world not only to pray for @entity102 and @entity8 , but also for everyone affected by this terrible virus			1
' the moment @entity39 reported a plane was leaving the @entity25 to pick up the @entity25 volunteers in @entity18 suffering from @entity42 , @entity218 lit up with @entity25 fuming over the decision			1
many were unable to understand why the patients could n't simply be treated in @entity18			2
' is it necessary that this person come to the @entity25 ? ca n't this be done other there ? ego trip ? ' tweeted @ 1ronweed			2
at least one of the dissenting tweets come from none other than @entity232			0
' @entity42 patient will be brought to the @entity25 in a few days - now i know for sure that our leaders are incompetent			1
@entity237 out of here ! ' @ @entity238 wrote			0
@entity232 is none - too - happy with the decision to bring an @entity42 patient to the @entity25 still others were simply thankful the patient or patients were being taken to @entity17			1
' thank god i do n't live in @entity22 , ' tweeted @ @entity246			0
so should we be worried ? not if the @entity15 's best - there - is containment systems and procedures work as they are supposed to			1
the patient or patients will be housed in an area of @entity21 's hospital that is physically separate from other patient areas , according to @entity39 's dr. @entity255			1
and inside the air will be filtered and none no staff will have any physical contact whatsoever with an infected patient outside of specialized hazmat - like suits			0
however , the move also comes soon after the @entity15 's recent string of reported mishandlings of other dangerous pathogens -- namely athrax and influenza -- made headlines -- made headlines and even forced the resignation of the head of the government lab that potentially exposed workers to live anthrax			2
dr @entity8 was in @entity4 with the missionary group responding to the @entity42 outbreak when he was diagnosed last week			1
his wife and children returned to the @entity25 before dr @entity8 showed any signs of illness			1
@entity91 has evacuated all of its non-essential personnel for the @entity42 outbreak			0
meanwhile on thursday , @entity25 health officials warned @entity25 not to travel to the three @entity4 countries hit by an outbreak of @entity42			1
the travel advisory applies to nonessential travel to @entity288 , @entity18 and @entity289 , where the deadly disease has killed more than 700 people this year			2
father : dr @entity8 , pictured with his family , ensured @entity102 received the experimental drug instead of him after a small amount arrived in @entity18 , the @entity91 charity said on wednesday waiting for an answer : @entity102 , pictured with her husband @entity201 , is entering a critical stage of her @entity42 treatment and will either show signs of recovery or inevitable death last week dr @entity8 , 33 , was identified as the first @entity25 to be diagnosed with @entity42 , which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects			1
mrs @entity102 , 60 , an educator turned missionary from @entity307 , @entity308 , was the second			0
the first stage of the illness is characterised by fever , headaches , nausea , vomiting , a rash and diarrhea			0
the second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body			0
blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red			0
they die an agonising death			0
generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive			0
mr @entity207 said that @entity208 had not yet identified how dr @entity8 and mrs @entity102 had become infected but said that they take ‘ extreme safety measures ’ and follow guidelines from the @entity15			1
he said : ' our hearts just break for them			0

father - of - two dr. @entity8 landed in @entity17 , @entity17 , just outside @entity22 , on saturday *morning* , from @entity18 in @entity4
listed as stable , the @entity3 man 's condition has improved in the last 24 @entity15 said sunday

a second patient , aid worker @entity102 , will arrive tuesday
both *victims* will be treated in a *super-high* containment facility at @entity22 's @entity21 near the @entity15
some people are outraged over the decision to bring @entity42 onto @entity25 soil for the first time
