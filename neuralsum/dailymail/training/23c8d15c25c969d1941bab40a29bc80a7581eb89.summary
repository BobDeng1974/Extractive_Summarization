by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:45 est , 22 march 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 24 march 2012 the @entity3 ' bird man ' who posted a video showing a successful ' test flight ' of a wing suit contraption has admitted that the amazing feat was a hoax all along			1
viewers became sceptical after it emerged that no scientists actually knew ' @entity12 ' , who claimed to have created the technology			1
now @entity12 has confessed that he is actually a ' filmmaker and animator ' named @entity15 , and has described the faked footage as ' online storytelling '			1
@entity18 lifts off - powered only by a run up and the flapping of the wings , without a rocket or a rotor in sight the engineer 's suit is made from a 200 square foot ' kite ' , powered by motorised wings which ' amplify ' @entity18 's arm movements he told a @entity3 television show : ' i am now eight months working on an experiment about online media , ' having begun blogging about the flying project last year			1
but mr @entity15 shot down rumours that the footage , which shows him soaring into the air , was intended to be publicity for a company			0
the mystery of ' @entity18 ' began when the institutions he claimed to belong to revealed they had never heard of the ' engineer '			2
@entity18 takes a run - up for his test flight			2
the 31 - year - old engineer claims that he ' flew ' 300 feet and stayed in the air for a minute @entity18 's invention uses accelerometers and motors to ' amplify ' the flapping of his arms his @entity55 biography links to @entity56 , a workplace which has no record of him - and there is also no record of @entity62 at @entity63 , which also appears on his cv			1
@entity67 ' video provoked controversy online , with many viewers claiming that it must be faked			2
the video shows a flight in a park in the @entity74 , which lasted about a minute			2
@entity18 runs through a park in the @entity74 flapping enormous , kite - like wings - and suddenly ' lifts off ' , flying 300 feet through the air			0
he claims to be the first human being to fly like a bird , without a jet or rotors - instead , he says he uses wings which ' amplify ' his muscles , with the motion sensors from @entity86 's @entity85 transferring motions into motors in the wings			1
the engineer claimed that wireless engines in the wings work as ' amplifiers ' for @entity18 's own arms , allowing him to flap wings that would otherwise be far too large for a single human			0
the technology is plausible - in theory			0
but effects experts quickly called into question whether @entity18 ' attempt is authentic			0
‘ they ’re able to afford to build this thing , but ca n’t invest in proper video equipment , or a tripod , ’ @entity99 , technical director at @entity102 's @entity101 and magic effects house said in an interview with @entity105			1
‘ if i were to make a fake video with the intention of going viral , i would make certain that the quality was as poor as possible to disguise any flaws in poor animation work			0
‘ i am suspicious because there is not much detail shown of the actual machine , ’ he says			0
‘ the device is also something that is only possible in recent times , given proliferation of these types of high torque , high power density brushless motors , high voltage speed controllers and lithium batteries , off the shelf carbon fiber components and so on			0
' @entity12 pretended that the ' suit ' is driven by @entity85 motion sensors in the arms which ' sense ' the pilot 's movements , helped by an accelerometer from an @entity135 smartphone			1
the movements are transferred into @entity138 motors which give @entity18 the power to move the 200 square foot wing , according to his claims			0
' ever since i was a little boy i have been inspired by pioneers like @entity145 , @entity146 , ' said @entity12 in a press release along with the video			0
@entity18 ' lifts off ' in a bird suit built from 200 square foot kite wings with motors in the wings that ' amplify ' his flapping smeets in triumph after his successful ' test flight ' - the engineer is sharing his techniques openly online so others can build their own ' wing suits '			1

doubts raised about video after it emerged no one had heard of ' wing suit creator ' @entity62
admits he 's a filmmaker engaged in eight - month ' experiment '
