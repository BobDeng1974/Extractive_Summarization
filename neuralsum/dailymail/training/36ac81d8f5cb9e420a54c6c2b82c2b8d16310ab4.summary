when @entity1 slipped through the @entity3 exit , @entity0 was quick to assess the situation , spot the opening and explode into action , much as he does on the pitch			1
he sought out @entity8 to ask for the no 10 shirt			1
he wanted to carry the number of his hero , @entity11 , on his back but he was under no illusions			1
hazard was not expecting @entity8 to transform him into the team ’s showman or hand him the licence to play where he liked , absolved of all defensive chores			1
6 - retired by both @entity23 and @entity29 in honour of @entity31 and @entity32 respectively			2
7 - from @entity34 to @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , it ’s a shirt for stars			1
10 - the most iconic number in football , made famous by the likes of @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity11 and @entity44			1
for one thing , it is not the way the @entity3 manager operates			1
for another , @entity0 feels the luxury playmaker , the iconic no 10 , may be gone for good			1
modern football is a blur of pace , mobility and industry			2
‘ i think football is finished with @entity22 , ’ said the @entity56 , formerly known as @entity3 ’s @entity57			1
‘ you have to play with two wingers and one striker			2
when i was young i played no 10 , but now i ’m a left winger or a right winger			2
during the game you can change			2
’ ‘ when @entity1 left the club i asked : “ can i take the @entity22 ? ” the manager said : “ yes , no problem ”			1
but it ’s just a number			2
if i play the same as last season , it ’s not because i have the @entity22			1
i have to do more			2
‘ i wanted it because it was the number of my idol , @entity11 , not when he was at @entity73 ( where he wore no 5 ) but before in the @entity74			1
’ hazard is shy of the obvious comparisons			2
can he emulate @entity11 ? ‘ maybe one day ; maybe one day , ’ he smiled			1
for all his individual brilliance as a dynamic winger , valued by @entity3 far higher than the £ 32million they paid when signing him from @entity81 two years ago , @entity0 has rarely wallowed in his status			1
on the ball : hazard , wearing no 10 , is challenged by @entity86 's @entity85 ( left ) at @entity87 on monday he prefers to dazzle on the field and disappear into the shadows			1
@entity8 has tried to coax more from him , encouraging @entity0 to embrace responsibility as one of the outstanding talents in the team , but he is a modest personality			1
he does not crave attention like , for example , @entity37 , although he is unquestionably one of the poster boys of the @entity99 and in commercial demand			2
he has the power to sells tickets , boots , shirts ... you name it			2
hazard is the new pack star of @entity109 and attempts to do this interview , designed to coincide with its launch , in @entity113			1
he is trying to speak more in @entity113 since his friend and interpreter @entity114 moved from @entity3 to @entity116			1
‘ it ’s too much for me , actually , ’ replied @entity0 , when asked about becoming @entity3 ’s answer to @entity37 or @entity44			1
‘ i do n’t like it			2
i am not this year better than them			2
they are here and i am here , ’ he says , holding his hands flat , one at head height and one by his chest			2
‘ i need to work , ’ he went on			0
‘ i am getting closer			0
i was voted the @entity128 , but i am 23			0
my first trophy in @entity130 was the @entity128			0
@entity3 is not just one player			1
it is not only me			0
we have signed a lot of players			0
now we have some good signings like @entity137 and @entity138			0
‘ @entity138 can score and that is good for me			0
@entity137 is one of the best midfielders in the world and we can have the chance to play , not better than last season because we had a lot of good games , but in an offensive style			0
i think together we can beat every team			0
’ superstar : @entity73 's @entity37 dribbles with the ball during the @entity151 match in @entity152 @entity153 : @entity154 's @entity44 on the ball during the @entity157 match on monday it started in impressive style at @entity86 on monday			1
@entity3 went a goal down but turned on the power with three goals in 17 minutes to ease through their first match of the season			1
it was an ominous display , especially if you are @entity167 , who visit @entity169 today			0
‘ we did very well , ’ said @entity0 , who contributed to @entity171 ’s great goal at @entity87 , with a robust dribble from the left , a move which pulled @entity86 ’s defence out of position and created space			1
even so , he is searching for more			0
‘ i know as soon as a game is finished if i have done well , ’ he said			0
‘ i do n’t need people to tell me			0
i want to achieve perfection			0
the @entity182 was good but not perfect			0
‘ it could have gone better			0
i did two good games but it was n’t enough			0
in @entity56 , people are happy because we have a very good team and lost against @entity188			1
people are sad because they know we could go further			0
sometimes you make one mistake and that ’s it			0
‘ @entity3 last season was not perfect because at the end i was injured			1
we lost many games at the end and lost our form			0
the whole season was good but the last months were not good			0
i need to score more goals			0
we need to go into a final , to be champions			0
we lost out in four trophies			0
” in demand : @entity0 is unquestionably one of the poster boys of the @entity99 @entity8 ’s team lost to @entity203 in the @entity205 semi-finals and finished four points adrift of @entity99 champions @entity207			1
like many at @entity169 , @entity0 points to the 1 - 0 defeat at @entity210 in march as the moment when the title challenge ended			1
‘ when we came back in the coach , everyone was angry , ’ he said			2
‘ everyone knew how important it was			0
’ hazard ’s own form faded from its mid-season high , as he played on with a slight achilles tendon problem			2
he was @entity3 ’s top scorer with 17 goals , but the final four were all penalties			1
he has not scored from open play since the second in a hat - trick against @entity226 in february			0
on his knees : hazard celebrates as he scores a hat - trick against @entity226 at @entity169 in february there was gentle criticism from @entity8 , who said he was not ‘ ready to sacrifice himself 100 per cent for the team ’ , and fuelled stories about a return to @entity130 with @entity235 , but @entity0 insists he is happy at @entity3 and enjoys working with the manager			1
‘ it is a pleasure to play under @entity8 and everything is ok , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i learn every day			0
he is a normal coach			0
he speaks a lot with the players			0
i like it when the manager speaks a lot with you because it gives you confidence			2
‘ sometimes when you lose one game he is sad and he shows other people			0
you must n’t smile when you lose			0
you have to be sad like other perople			0
you have to win every game			0
’ so it is on the quest to be @entity3 ’s perfect 10			1
