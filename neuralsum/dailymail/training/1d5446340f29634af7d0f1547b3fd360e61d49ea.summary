by @entity0 an 11 - month - old baby from @entity2 has won a national competition to become the first professional @entity5 lookalike			1
@entity6 , who was born just four days before the young prince , was picked from hundreds of hopefuls by a personalised baby gift retailer			1
he 's already modelled a so - called @entity10 , launched in time for @entity5 's first birthday on july 22 , and will be seen in new ranges in the coming months			2
can you tell the difference between little @entity6 ( left ) and @entity5 ? the toddler was put forward by his mother @entity16 after family friends remarked on his uncanny resemblance to the royal prince during the @entity21 's recent trip to @entity22			1
as well as looking like @entity5 , @entity6 seems to share some of his characteristics			2
he 's a happy and laid back , loves being outside , adores animals - especially his pet dog @entity26 - and is now starting to move around without too much help from mum and dad			0
but the similarities between the royal family and the @entity6 family do n't end there			1
@entity16 and her husband @entity34 got engaged the same year as @entity35 and @entity36 , tied the knot five months after the couple and @entity6 was born just four days before @entity5			1
mother @entity16 pictured with little freddie at a party - the little tot has since won a lookalike contest @entity16 said : ' i 've always been a fan of the @entity44 and the similarities between my family and the @entity21 's is strange			1
' i never noticed @entity6 's resemblance to @entity5 until i saw all the tv coverage during their recent visit to @entity22 and @entity51			1
@entity5 was dressed in clothes similar to those @entity6 wears and they seem to have the same temperament			2
' like @entity5 , @entity6 moves around by himself although he 's skipped the crawling and has gone straight to trying to walk , and just like the @entity56 , if he is n't doing what he wants , has a very cute pouty , sulky face			1
' he 's also obsessed by our family dog @entity26 , just like @entity5 appears to be with @entity62			0
the @entity63 and @entity36 and @entity5 in @entity51 @entity6 is obsessed by the family dog @entity26 - just as @entity5 appears to be with @entity62 the toddler was put forward by mother @entity16 after family friends remarked on his uncanny resemblance ' i always dress @entity6 in traditional - looking clothes when we 're going out and adore some of the @entity72 baby clothes designers , just like @entity36			2
' freddie being selected as a @entity5 lookalike seems almost natural			0
there are so many similarities between my family and the @entity44 that is seems fitting			0
all we need now is for @entity36 and @entity35 to have a daughter - freddie would make a great real - life @entity56			0
' @entity81 from @entity82 said : ' as soon as we saw the photos of @entity6 we could see the resemblance instantly			0
' like the young prince he 's a natural in front of the camera and was a pleasure to work with			0
' we had hundred of mums and dads contact us with pictures of their sons who resemble the @entity56 and it was tough to select just one			0
