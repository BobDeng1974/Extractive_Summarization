@entity1 captain @entity0 will attempt to steer clear of the growing expectation surrounding the side following their flawless start to @entity6 qualifying			1
a clinical 2 - 0 away win over @entity9 's faltering favourites @entity10 on tuesday made it three wins in three for @entity13 's men , @entity1 's best ever start to a @entity14 or @entity16 campaign			1
that leaves them top of the standings by two points and in with a wonderful chance of reaching their first major finals in 30 years			1
@entity0 ( left ) says its important @entity1 remain focused as they attempt @entity6 qualification but while @entity28 midfielder @entity0 is delighted for the fans back home , who can now start to dream of an unexpected trip to @entity32 , he feels it is no bad thing for the squad to get back across the water and away from the excitement			1
' i do n't think trying to keep our feet on the ground will be much of an issue , ' said @entity0 , whose side came into the group having dropped into seeding pot five			2
' it may help that we do n't see the hype at home but it is great to have that again			0
@entity0 ( right ) has captained @entity1 to three wins out of three in their @entity6 qualification group ' people have optimism but we know there is another tough away game next month in @entity58 and the most important thing for us is to continue the momentum			1
' it 's been an unbelievable start for us because i do n't think anyone could have foreseen it , especially the way the fixtures came out with two tough away games in @entity68 and @entity10			2
' we are just delighted with the start and we will enjoy it but then it 's about concentrating on @entity58 next month			0
' @entity1 striker @entity72 has scored in all three of their @entity6 qualifiers so far @entity0 joined the praise for striker @entity72 , who maintained his own 100 per cent record of scoring in every game so far			1
the @entity80 man has not always delivered on his promise on the international stage but has shown a new - found maturity this year , with man - of - the - match displays against @entity68 , the @entity85 and @entity10			2
and @entity0 is delighted to see his former @entity87 team - mate back at his imposing best			0
' @entity88 has been excellent			0
he gives us that outlet and in the first three games he 's been outstanding , ' he said			0
@entity72 ( right ) scored @entity1 's second in their 2 - 0 win in @entity10 on tuesday night ' he 's been unbelievable for us but that is the sort of thing we are going to need from him if we are going to be successful			1
' it 's been an excellent start and i 'm sure he will take a lot of confidence from it			0
' he really deserves it			0
he works so hard for the team , even in the past and it 's nice to see him getting his rewards			0
