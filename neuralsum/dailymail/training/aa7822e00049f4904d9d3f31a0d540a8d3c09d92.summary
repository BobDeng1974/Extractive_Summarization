by @entity0 published : 15:40 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 3 december 2013 health secretary @entity1 has blamed the rise of needless @entity4 visits in part on @entity6 allowing @entity7 to opt out of working out of hours nearly half of all patients who go to @entity4 do not need treatment , shocking new figures reveal.about a third merely need medical advice while 13 per cent do not even require that			1
as casualty departments are braced for a winter crisis , many patients are wrongly going to @entity4 when they should be going to a pharmacy , a gp or using basic first aid			1
the @entity20 says 21.7million patients went to casualty last year , up by 57 per cent from 13.8million in 2008/9			1
of these , an astonishing 47 per cent left @entity4 without needing treatment – up from 33 per cent in 2009/10			1
health secretary @entity1 has said the rise in numbers going to @entity4 is partly due to a disastrous gp contract negotiated by @entity6			1
this allowed family doctors to opt out of working out of hours , leaving patients with nowhere else to go			1
‘ @entity6 ’s 2004 gp contract did terrible damage to out - of - hours care , leaving many people feeling they have no choice but to go to @entity4 when they want medical attention , ’ mr @entity1 said yesterday			1
‘ that ’s why we are ripping up @entity6 ’s old contract , and bringing back traditional family doctors to take personal responsibility for patients ’ care – starting with the over- 75s			2
’ @entity43 , of the think - tank @entity44 , said many would not need to go to @entity4 had they managed to see their gp or even just get hold of them over the phone			2
‘ it shows a lack of information around first aid , it shows that people ’s expectations have changed and there ’s much more of a sense of entitlement rather than using services appropriately , ’ she said			0
senior doctors say this winter could be one of the worst yet for @entity4 departments due to a lack of senior doctors and rising numbers of patients			2
@entity68 , president of the @entity69 , said : ‘ i do n’t think i am being particularly shroud - waving when i say this year is going to be one of the worst			0
it certainly is n’t going to get any better			0
‘ at the moment we have the capacity to see three - quarters of a million fewer patients than three years ago because we have 370 fewer registrars [ senior doctors ]			0
‘ but the number of patients we are having to see has risen by a quarter of a million in the last year			0
’ @entity80 , right , chairman of the @entity81 said the ' shambolic ' @entity83 helpline had worsened the @entity4 crisis , while @entity43 , right , from think tank @entity85 said many would not need to go to hospital if they could see their gp or even just get hold of them over the phone the @entity81 , which represents doctors , said the shambolic @entity83 helpline had worsened the crisis with call centre workers wrongly telling patients to go to @entity4			1
@entity81 chairman @entity80 said : ‘ rising attendance rates , coupled with the government ’s drive to do more with less , mean many emergency departments are under extreme pressure and are close to capacity			0
‘ to alleviate pressure and reduce unnecessary attendance we need to ensure patients know how and where to access appropriate care and that they get the right advice first time round			2
‘ key to this is having an effective out - of - hours telephone service , yet the disastrous introduction of @entity83 replaced a clinician - led service with a call centre and was responsible for many people being wrongly directed to emergency departments			0
’ officials said the latest statistics could indicate that the figures were being properly recorded for the first time , rather than being a sign that they were rising			0
in the past few months , the government has invested an extra £ 400million in @entity4 departments , some of which will be spent hiring extra staff and making more beds available from previously closed wards .			0

figures published by the @entity20 show *34* per cent of patients visiting @entity4 last year only needed advice
another 13 per cent did not even need medical advice
health secretary @entity1 blamed pressure on @entity4 in part on @entity6 *'s* *decision* to give *gps* the chance to opt - out of working out of hours
experts say many people should be visiting pharmacies , their doctor or using basic first aid instead of going straight to hospital
