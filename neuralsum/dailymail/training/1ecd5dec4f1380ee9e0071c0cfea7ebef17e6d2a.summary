a hunter who received negative comments on @entity2 after sharing photos of her next to a massive bear she killed has spoken out against her critics			1
the two photos that @entity7 shared on friday and saturday were from a @entity9 hunting trip taken alongside her television presenter father father @entity10			1
they both appear on ' @entity10 's @entity12			2
' one of @entity10 's photo captions says the bear she killed weighed 510.2lbs			1
her photographs have since received thousands of comments and sparked a heated debate between pro-hunting and anti-hunting supporters			2
on saturday , @entity10 posted a selfie showing her with her dog and wrote ' an anti-hunter just told me , and i quote , to " kill that little worthless dog you have instead " of the bear i just hunted in @entity9			1
' apparently hunting a bear , eating / donating all of the meat and putting money towards conservation is a bad thing , but killing my puppy is ok			2
if this logic is n't totally insane , i do n't know what is			0
among the thousands of comments posted online , one user wrote ' such a beautiful animal shot dead for nothing but your pleasure , real nice , a real accomplishment you should be proud			0
' another said ' @entity66 killer ! that bear has more beauty alive than dead ! so sad , and y would u even want to pose in a pic like this ? ! ' other commenters have congratulated @entity10 for getting the bear and offered words of support			2
multiple @entity2 users have uploaded photos of animals they 've killed while hunting			1
' stay strong girl there just trying to get u riled up			0
congrats beautiful bear , ' one supporter wrote			0
a different user said ' congrats on your hunt ... sorry for all the negative words from others ... just stay the course			0
' in a monday interview with ' @entity94 ' @entity10 was asked about the ' sick ' comments she received -- and responded ' it is sick , i agree with you			1
but unfortunately we actually have to deal with that quite a lot , so this comment particularly - i 've never heard someone tell me to kill my puppy before , but comments like this - they definitely happen to us			0
' on the program , @entity10 also spoke about her father 's advice to her for handling online commenters , saying ' if they say something hurtful like my dad should shoot me in the head - i mean , that happens , that 's what they say - and i 'm like " oh my goodness " but he says " stay above it , stay true to yourself and just show what you believe , " and i believe with every part of me that what i 'm doing is right , so there 's nothing that i 'm apologizing for			2
' so in that sense , i mean i 'm not going to apologize to them , but i will say that i 'd love to explain to them , i 'd love to show them everyday what i do , that hunting is a good thing			0
' beloved pooch : @entity10 says an online commenter suggested her dog be killed instead of the bear famous family : @entity7 went on the hunting trip with her father and television presenter @entity10 , pictured			1
they both appear on the program ' @entity10 's @entity147 ' @entity10 also said during the ' @entity94 ' interview ' i think the biggest thing as far as being a proud hunter is that what we 're doing is a good thing and i mean we 're raising , huge , huge , huge amounts of money for conservation every year , something the anti-hunters - they 're fighting hunters			1
but when they 're fighting hunters , technically they 're just fighting us raising money for wildlife habitat and that 's not really doing anything for them			1
i mean , it 's backfiring			0
' so , if they understood how much money we 're putting into hunting , how in @entity9 specifically the hunt i was just on , the bear population and the human population , they 're both rising really fast and obviously we 're not going to get rid of the humans so at that point you have no choice , it 's human nature , you need to make room for the humans to live there so you have to keep the bear population in check			1
' and if the hunters do n't do it , then the bears are going to be increasing			0
there 's highway collisions , there 's huge , huge dollars in crop degradation every year , and if we do n't do something the farmers are going to do it and it wo n't be as nice as the hunters and we wo n't be bringing in the money to this economy			0
