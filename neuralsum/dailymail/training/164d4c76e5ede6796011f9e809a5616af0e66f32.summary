by @entity0 last updated at 11:28 am on 20th january 2012 on july 6 , 2011 , the last few seconds of a comet 's dive into the sun , when it evaporated in the heat above the star 's surface , were caught on camera for the first time			1
comet - watchers were astonished			2
no one had expected to be able to see the final moment , even with today 's best orbiting space observatories			1
' @entity13 are usually too dim to be seen in the glare of the @entity16 ’s light , ” says @entity18 project scientist for @entity20 's orbiting @entity19			1
' we ’ve been telling people we ’d never see one in @entity19 data			0
' the comet flies across the surface of the sun. sky - watchers were astonished - most comets are too dim to be detected against the sun 's glare but an ultrabright comet , from a group known as the @entity35 comets , overturned everybody 's ideas			1
the comet can was seen moving over the right side of the @entity16 , disappearing 20 minutes later as it evaporates in the searing heat			2
watching the comet ’s death provides a new way to estimate the comet ’s size			2
the comet turns out to be somewhere between 150 and 300 feet long and to have about as much mass as an aircraft carrier			1
' of course , it ’s doing something very different than what aircraft carriers do , ' says @entity54 , a solar scientist at @entity56 in @entity57			0
' it was moving along at almost 400 miles per second through the intense heat of the @entity16 -- and was literally being evaporated away			0
' the comet was detected on july 4 , so @entity20 's @entity19 was able to train cameras on it as it approached the sun scientists at the @entity65 at the @entity66 in @entity57 , discovered the comet on july 4 , 2011 , by using the @entity68 on the @entity70 / @entity69 ( @entity71 )			1
it was the @entity71 discovery that alerted @entity56 scientists to watch data from the @entity19 's cameras for the comet 's likely transit across the face of the @entity16 ' this unprecedented passage of a comet through the solar atmosphere in view of our @entity84 cameras presented us with a remarkable opportunity , ' said dr. @entity54 , lead author of the science paper			1
' as we witnessed this comet evaporate as it traversed a known amount of space over a specific period of time , we were able to work backward to estimate its mass just before it reached the sun. we ’ve been able to bracket its size as between 150 and 300 feet long , with a greater likelihood that it lies at the upper end of that range			1
and it most likely weighed in at as much as 70,000 tons , giving it about the weight of an aircraft carrier , when it first became visible to @entity84			1
' as the comet streaked into the solar atmosphere it had already fractured into many large pieces ranging in size from 30 to 150 feet			2
the pieces were embedded in the nebulous envelope made up of ice , dust , and gas called the coma , surrounding the comet ’s nucleus			0
the coma was estimated to be about 800 miles across , followed by a glowing tail approximately 10,000 miles long			0
the tail was seen pulsing from dim to bright to dim again during the journey across the @entity16 , which suggests that there was further breakup of the individual chunks of comet eventually , the comet evaporated completely			2
' i think the light pulses in the tail were one of the most interesting things we witnessed , ' said @entity54			0
' the comet ’s tail gets brighter by as much as four times every minute or two			0
the comet seems first to put a lot of material into that tail , then less , and then the pattern repeats			0
' only because of these pulses can we measure how fast the tail falls behind the comet as its gases collide with those in the @entity16 ’s atmosphere			0
and that , in turn , helps us measure the comet ’s weight			0

first time cameras have captured the way a comet ' dies ' - most are too dim to be seen in sun 's light
@entity20 had never expected to capture final moment
allows scientists to work out size and mass of comet
*object* was up to 300 feet long , and around the mass of an aircraft carrier
