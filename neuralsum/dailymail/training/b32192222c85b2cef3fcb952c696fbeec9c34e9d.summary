@entity0 has given the strongest indication yet that @entity3 ’s dream of playing for @entity4 in next year ’s @entity5 will not be realised			1
the @entity7 flanker can not currently be selected for @entity4 due to the @entity9 ’s strict policy on overseas players , and last week @entity11 revealed that @entity0 ’s refusal to guarantee he would pick him if he moved to @entity14 played a large part in scuppering the deal			1
@entity3 , 29 , sought assurances that he would be included in @entity19 ’s 33 - man elite player squad , which was named on wednesday , but the @entity4 head coach would not offer preferential treatment , leading to the @entity14 deal collapsing and @entity3 hinting that he could now try to gain selection for @entity24 on residency grounds			1
@entity4 hopeful @entity3 in action for @entity24 giants and @entity29 champions @entity7 against @entity30 when asked if the door was closed on @entity3 , @entity0 said : ‘ he has obviously chosen to stay at @entity7 , so yes in the short term			1
@entity3 's choice to stay at @entity7 has shut the door on his @entity4 hopes , says @entity0 ‘ we ’ll obviously have to wait and see how it plays out , if there is any truth in the rumour in him wanting to go down a different nationality route			1
but i ’ve made it clear that in order to be playing in this series and the @entity48 he would have to be back here playing , and he ’s not			2
’ when asked if he had refused to offer @entity3 any guarantees he would be picked , @entity0 replied : ‘ i ca n’t guarantee anyone anything			1
it ’s right that people have to earn their right to get into the team			2
i do n’t guarantee @entity57 a place			1
i do n’t guarantee anyone			2
they have to earn the right			2
it ’s the basis of group dynamics			2
‘ you have got to give everyone a fair and equal opportunity			0
there are a lot of people who have worked extremely hard to get this opportunity and if you can be on the end of the phone call when you tell a @entity72 or a @entity73 that he will get a chance to come and train with @entity4 it is then unfair to say that actually this guy has got a guaranteed pick			1
’ @entity72 ’s selection — as first reported in last week ’s @entity11 — behind @entity57 , @entity78 and @entity79 means @entity3 appears too far down the pecking order to have a hope of inclusion next september			1
@entity0 is expected to call up @entity84 flanker @entity83 on sunday , along with @entity86 ’s exciting young centre @entity85 and five other players , including @entity84 scrum - half @entity88 and @entity14 winger @entity90			1
@entity3 was linked to a move to @entity14 but that stalled reportedly when an @entity4 place was n't assured @entity72 ( centre ) is a new face in the @entity4 squad , named on wednesday , ahead of @entity3 the @entity4 head coach has told his players that with only 12 tests to play before the @entity5 and ‘ time running out ’ , his side must claim at least three victories in four @entity100 this autumn , starting against the @entity102 on november 8 , to be considered serious contenders			1
but , with one eye on next year ’s home tournament , @entity0 also revealed this week that he intends to use the test against @entity107 on november 22 — which kicks off at 7pm — to streamline procedures for late matches to help players avoid boredom			1
‘ that week will be a slightly different week anyway , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ we ’ll have played @entity102 and then @entity116 — two massively big and physical teams — so we might adapt the week differently and give the players a little bit of a break at the start of the week			2
we will probably do our captain ’s run at a later time of day			1
little things like that will be different			0
‘ by having the captain ’s run later , the players might go to bed a bit later and therefore might wake up a bit later			1
you move your meals accordingly to deal with that evening kick - off			0
what you do on the day of the game ... it ’s quite a long time			2
when you ’re a player it ’s even worse			0
you need to fill your day appropriately so that you ’re physically firing at the right time			2
@entity0 said no player in his @entity4 squad is guaranteed a place in the team ‘ part of that then allows us to look at what our processes are and our build - up to evening kick - offs			1
because all our @entity5 games are evening kick - offs			0
‘ it was a collective decision by the union because we ’ve got three games at 8pm during the @entity5			0
that does affect how you structure your day			0
it affects the stadium — playing under floodlights — and everything else			0
‘ that apart we ’ll be operating our build - ups as normal			0
’ @entity0 ’s inclusion of @entity73 — an uncapped @entity161 - born soldier in the @entity162 — drew most attention			1
the 27 - year - old has been in scintillating form for @entity14 this season just two years after signing professional papers and seven years after touring @entity168 ’s notorious @entity167 as an infantryman			0
‘ i said to the boys at @entity14 , if you go out on the pitch and something goes wrong you can always come back next week , review it , go through the process and come back better and stronger , ’ @entity73 told @entity11			1
‘ but out there in @entity168 you ca n’t afford to make those kind of mistakes because you are putting someone ’s life in danger out there			0
the naming of @entity14 flyer @entity73 attracted the most attention when the squad was named former @entity162 infantryman @entity73 served in @entity186 province in @entity168 ‘ if you mess something up or miss an opportunity you are letting the boys down and allowing the terrorists time to kill someone			1
you ca n’t afford to do that			0
‘ in my first week out there i witnessed a @entity195 lose both of his legs and i was thinking to myself , “ that could be me ”			0
‘ the way i see it now i want to make every opportunity count and take every single opportunity that comes my way			0
‘ when you experience something like that it teaches you a lesson in life			0
that ’s how i ’m looking at my professional rugby career			2
i have one go at this and i do n’t intend to mess it up			0
’ @entity19 — a big supporter of the armed forces — will consider asking @entity73 to relive his experiences in @entity168 to the wider squad			1
‘ i would n’t want to put that on him to start with , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ but potentially ( i ’ll ask him to talk )			0
‘ i want to settle him in and make him feel comfortable			0
he came in in june which was great because we got to know him a bit before we flew to @entity102 — he played in that @entity225 game			0
‘ we ’ll see how he goes against the @entity102			0

@entity4 coach @entity0 said he wo n't guarantee anyone 's place
@entity0 said he stands by the rule that to be in the @entity4 squad players must be plying their trade in the @entity233
he added that not even captain @entity57 is guaranteed a place
@entity73 *compared* rugby with his time in the armed forces , and @entity0 may ask him to relay his experiences to the squad
