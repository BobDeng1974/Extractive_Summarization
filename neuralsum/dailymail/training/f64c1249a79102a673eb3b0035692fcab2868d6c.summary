hundreds of @entity1 prisoners are to stay in @entity3 jails at a cost of £ 27m a year after their government turned down a deal for them to be returned			1
the @entity7 has been trying to persuade successive @entity1 governments to allow up to 737 prisoners to be returned to the island to serve sentences for crimes committed in the @entity3			2
a voluntary agreement to allow prisoner transfers was signed in 2007 but seven years later it has still not been ratified by the @entity1 parliament			1
@entity1 make up the third largest number of foreign nationals in @entity3 jails , after @entity20 and @entity21 , and they will be allowed to stay after their government rejected a new compulsory transfer agreement and now a proposed compulsory deal to send the prisoners home has been rejected after the @entity1 government claimed it would be unconstitutional			1
the embarrassing snub is a further blow to @entity3 taxpayers , who already pay £ 400 million a year for the imprisonment of 10,600 foreigners from 157 countries			0
conservative mp @entity37 expressed anger at the attitude of the @entity1 government and told the @entity40 : ‘ given they are a @entity43 country and they have the third highest number of foreign nationals in @entity3 prisons , it ought to be a priority of the @entity3 government to negotiate such an agreement as soon as possible			1
’ and previous attempts on the part of both @entity50 and the @entity51 to transfer foreign prisoners have proved fruitless – because the prisoners have to consent to the move and can refuse on the grounds of human rights			0
@entity57 previously said @entity3 taxpayers should fund foreign jails to enure that prisoners can be deported under the current voluntary deals , both countries , as well as the prisoner , must consent to the transfer , and there are fears that even with a compulsory deal prisoners can claim that being sent home will be a breach to their right to a family life			1
@entity1 make up the third largest proportion of nationalities in our prisons , after @entity20 and @entity77 inmates , and an @entity79 deal , which is expected to allow the compulsory transfer of hundreds of @entity79 citizens when it comes into force this year , has exemptions for states with the highest number of people in jails			1
@entity77 prisoners will not routinely be considered for transfer because of the close links between the two countries , and @entity20 , which tops the list , has been given an opt - out until next year to ensure that its prisons can cope last year @entity57 announced @entity3 taxpayers were to fund a major prison building programme in poor countries such as @entity98 and @entity1 , because no prisoners would choose to go to a foreign prison where conditions are worse than in @entity3 ones			2
at the time he said : ‘ when people are sent to prison in the @entity3 we should do everything we can to make sure that if they ’re foreign nationals , they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence in a foreign prison			2
’ he added : ‘ we should be using all of the influence we have to sign prisoner transfer agreements with those countries			0
even if necessary frankly helping them to build prisons in their own country so we can send the prisoners home			0
’ @entity119 , of the @entity120 ’ @entity118 , said : ‘ taxpayers should not have to pay for what amounts to a bribe to boot out criminals who should not be here			0
’ it was found in 2012 that one in eight prisoners – 11,000 inmates - are clogging up our jails			0
a @entity7 spokesperson told the @entity40 : ‘ we are currently providing @entity1 with advice on prison reform with a view to returning to discussions on this matter			0
