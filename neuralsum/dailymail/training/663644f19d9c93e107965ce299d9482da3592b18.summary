scientists tracking the spread of @entity2 have warned the virus is showing signs of mutating scientists tracking the spread of the @entity2 in @entity6 have warned the virus is showing signs of mutating , and could become more contagious			1
it was a team of researchers from the @entity11 in @entity12 who first identified the outbreak in @entity15 , in march last year			1
patient zero - the first person to be infected - has been identified as two - year - old @entity18 from the rural village of @entity20			2
he died four days after he fell ill with a sky - high fever and vomiting in december 2013			2
just weeks later his sister succumbed to the disease , followed by their mother and grandmother			0
from there the virus spread , before the scientists at @entity11 identified it as @entity2 three months later after it was reported to the health authorities			1
the team have since been tracing the virus ' spread through @entity15 , to establish if the disease could become more contagious			1
they have started the process of examining hundreds of blood samples from @entity2 patients in the @entity6 nation where the first cases struck in december 2013			1
human geneticist dr @entity43 , told the @entity44 : ' we know the virus is changing quite a lot			1
' that 's important for diagnosing and for treatment			0
we need to know how the virus ( is changing ) to keep up with our enemy			1
' he told @entity55 's today programme viruses have to ' fight a balance ' between infecting people and spreading			0
' we have seen several cases that do n't have any symptoms at all when infected , ' he said			0
' these people may be the ones who could spread the virus better , we do not know yet			2
' a virus can change from more deadly into less deadly but more contagious and that is something we are afraid of			2
' viruses do change over a period of time			0
@entity2 is an rna virus , similar to @entity70 and influenza , and as such it has a high rate of mutation			1
but while it is not surprising the virus is mutating , experts said , we can not predict how it will evolve			1
dr @entity80 , science portfolio developer at the @entity81 , which is funding one of the experiment vaccinations in development , said the longer the virus remains infecting the human population , ' the more likely it is to mutate and adapt to its environment '			2
but she cautioned : ' there is really no precedent for any known rna virus to mutate so radically that it would change its mode of transmission			1
' people can only catch @entity2 by coming into contact with the bodily fluids - urine , vomit , diarrhoea - of an infected individual			1
it is not an airborne disease , and as such can not be transmitted through infected people coughing or breathing in open spaces			2
dr @entity80 added : ' @entity70 is another rna virus that mutates all the time and has been circulating in far more people than @entity2 , yet its route of transmission remains unchanged			1
' while acknowledging it is important to study the way @entity2 is changing to help better understand how to tackle it , and how it responds to vaccines and drugs , she said a suggestion the virus could become airborne is ' unfounded '			1
echoing dr @entity80 's thoughts , @entity131 , professor of molecular virology at the @entity133 said it is a well known fact that viruses mutate			0
' even if the virus is mutating , we do n't know what impact , if any , those genetic changes are having , ' he said			2
' asymptomatic infection is not a new thing , it 's been seen in past outbreaks			0
' why some people remain well while others die is not clear , but it 's most likely down to the host , our own genetic make - up has a massive influence on how viral infections affect us			0
' it 's feasible , he said , that changes in the virus could change the severity of the infection but said the truth is scientists do not yet have the answers			0
' that 's why studying virus and host genetics is important , ' he added			0
' when at last we have those answers , then we can start to determine their possible impact			0
' meanwhile the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) said there were fewer than 100 cases in a week for the first time since june			0
in the week from january 25 there were 30 cases in @entity15 , four in @entity121 and 65 in @entity120			0
the @entity122 said the epidemic has entered a ' second phase ' with the focus shifting to ending the outbreak .			0

researchers in @entity12 believe the *ebola* virus is showing signs of mutating
team have been tracing the virus ' spread throughout *guinea*
experts say it is ' not surprising ' the virus is changing - it is like @entity70 and influenza which tend to mutate *quickly*
they cautioned it is very unlikely @entity2 will mutate to become airborne
