by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:04 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 16:48 est , 23 december 2013 her sitcom is a massive hit adored by millions , but @entity6 has revealed she has been so crippled by self - doubt that she turned to the late @entity8 for inspiration			1
‘ i got to a point a year ago possibly when it was all a bit too much , ’ the 41 - year - old admits on today ’s edition of @entity14 ’s @entity13			1
‘ it was quite lonely and i was struggling			2
‘ i thought is it worth it ? because you are not doing it for yourself			2
you are doing it for an audience			2
@entity6 has told how her hero @entity8 helped her get through difficult times in her life and are they out there laughing ? and is comedy a noble , worthwhile career ? ‘ that was the key question i would have asked @entity8 and i hope he would have said , “ yes , it ’s worth it			1
” ’ she adds : ‘ then you find ways to manage your life that means you are not in that place – which i am not now			1
i feel a lot happier , and more confident and celebratory of what i have achieved			2
’ @entity8 , who died in 1984 , is best known as one half of legendary comedy duo @entity42 @entity8 , who died in 1984 , was the subject of a documentary made by @entity6 that was screened on @entity46 earlier this year , and she describes the late star as ‘ simply my hero ’			1
she added : ‘ if it was n’t for him i would n’t have launched into getting into comedy			2
he gave me the licence to be silly and think grown - ups can do that			0
’ @entity6 also says she is far more introverted in real life than her persona in her sitcom			1
she says : ‘ she is my clown			0
my on - stage licence to be silly and enjoy life and admit where life is awkward and the real me is an introvert really			1
’ she also says she finds it difficult to cope with the public ’s affection for her alter ego			0
she says ‘ i think they think she is their best friend , which is lovely and that is what i wanted to do with the character			0
' but i never expected the sitcom to be a success so i did n’t expect that i would have to deal with the fact that i have got that expectation to meet			1
’ @entity6 , whose song selections for @entity13 include the @entity42 theme @entity81 , also reveals she was thrilled to be offered the part of @entity83 in the drama @entity85			1
she returns to play the role in the @entity88 edition of the show			1
@entity6 will reprise her role as @entity83 in a @entity88 episode of @entity85 ‘ it did n’t feel like a risk , ’ she says			1
‘ it felt like just the most wonderful opportunity			2
@entity96 , who wrote the @entity85 books , sent me a copy of it and said , “ you remind me of my friend @entity83			0
i ’d love you to play her			0
” ‘ i read it and i thought i have to play this character			0
it was n’t too much of a leap			0
@entity6 is @entity83 now – admitting and showing vulnerability			1
if someone says how are you and you say “ i ’ve had an awful day ”			0
the relief on people ’s faces because we are all keeping up a pretence			0
‘ the minute you get a character like @entity83 who shows her vulnerability , everyone identifies with her and wants her to win			0
’ earlier this year , @entity6 made a documentary about @entity8 , and says that learning about him helped her learn how to manage her life better @entity6 ’s father , a former @entity121 commander , was aboard the destroyer @entity123 when it was sunk during the 1982 @entity125			1
and she tells @entity13 host @entity126 that she was in her 20s when she finally realised how close he had come to death			0
she says : ‘ he did n’t speak at all when he got back			0
he put everything on tape and then when i was in my early 20s he allowed me to type them all up , which was amazing and quite emotional listening to his voice going through it so close to the event			0

@entity6 admits that she felt *overwhelmed* by her massive success
learned more about the life of @entity8 while making documentary
describes the late @entity42 star as ' my hero ' on radio show
