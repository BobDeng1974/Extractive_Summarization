by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott as part of the build - up to the start of @entity6 's @entity5 season , we will be taking a look at players new to the @entity9 with the potential to light up @entity12 's top tier over the coming campaign			1
@entity14 in a nutshell @entity17 fans have every right to mourn the exodus of talent from @entity21 's this summer , but in recent signing @entity14 , they also have a reason to hope			1
the muscular 6ft 4in forward has the physical attributes to torment @entity9 defences , and a clinical edge to his game that could make him a huge hit on the south coast			0
he also prodived six assists for his team - mates over the course of the league campaign and won on average 5.4 aerial duels a game , while having 4.3 shots per match			0
his pass success rate - at 69.7 % - was quite high for a striker that is often trying to bring others into play			0
( stats courtesy of @entity62 ) why you should have @entity64 @entity17 boss @entity65 made the @entity67 his first purchase after taking the reins at the club , with the @entity42 coach confident his former @entity34 charge has what it takes to fill the void upfront created by @entity76 's move to @entity17			1
the 29 - year - old 's phenomenal goalscoring record in recent years at @entity34 shows he poses a far greater threat than your average target man			2
there is also huge potential for him to thrive leading the line for @entity65 's @entity17 side , with @entity86 - should he stay at the club - set to play just off the imposing frontman			2
his @entity5 price , £ 8.2m , is another reason why it is worth taking a punt on @entity14			1
he will be first - choice at @entity21 's , particularly with @entity65 in charge , and his transfer fee is far lower than some other strikers in the @entity9 who are likely to see far less playing time			1
in action : @entity14 shields the ball against @entity99 , left , and , right , beats @entity100 in an aerial duel prolific : @entity14 scored 26 times in 33 matches in all competitions for @entity34 during the last campaign click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100m squad now ... the game he proved his worth in it 's early doors for @entity14 at @entity17 but the striker has impressed in his pre-season outings for the @entity17			1
on his debut he scored twice in his first 45 minutes on the pitch against @entity117 , and he also put in an impressive performance during @entity65 's side 's 1 - 0 win over @entity121 , @entity14 's first match on @entity12 soil for the club			2
his hold - up play was superb in both , and he also showed his ability in front of goal with a couple of neat finishes in the first game and some shots on target in the latter			0
off the mark : @entity14 scores his first goal for the club during @entity17 's friendly win over @entity139 making an early impact : the @entity67 scored twice in @entity17 's 6 - 0 win against @entity139 do n't just take our word for it @entity65 believes he has got a rare commodity in @entity14 after making the @entity67 his first signing at @entity21 's			1
he said ' i had @entity14 in my team for my last two years at @entity34			0
he scored a lot of goals - more than 50 in two seasons - and they brought a lot of points to the club			0
' goals mean points , and we needed a good player in that position after @entity76 left			0
' in terms of his qualities , he 's a tall striker with a lot of movement and he 's fast			0
he 's a player who gives confidence to the team because he keeps the ball , and he 's very dangerous in front of goal			0
' new man : @entity17 boss @entity65 believes @entity14 can replicate his @entity34 form at @entity21 's @entity172 's a better , cheaper version of ... loads of premier league strikers at £ 8.2m @entity14 is the 33rd most expensive striker in @entity6 's @entity5 game , despite his phenomenal scoring record in @entity181			1
just a few of the players that the 29 - year - old is cheaper and arguably better than ... @entity184 - £ 9.9m @entity76 - £ 9.7m @entity185 - £ 9.2m @entity186 - £ 8.9m @entity187 - £ 8.5m @entity188 - £ 8.3m			2

@entity14 agreed a three - year deal at @entity21 's after moving from @entity34
@entity17 move saw him *re-united* with his former boss @entity65
@entity67 - born forward scored 23 goals in the @entity45 last season
@entity14 costs £ 8.2m in @entity6 's @entity5 game , £ 1.5m less than @entity76 , who left @entity17 to join @entity199 earlier this summer
