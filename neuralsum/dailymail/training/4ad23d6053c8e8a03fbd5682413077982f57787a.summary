by @entity0 published : 11:10 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 02:36 est , 16 may 2012 he is not the first politician to attempt to ' look cool , ' when listening to music and he definitely wo n't be the last			2
but @entity4 has become an unlikely internet hit after a @entity7 user flagged up his embarrassing attempt to bob his head along to a rock band			1
the chancellor was a guest on the @entity13 when the presenter introduced @entity17 band @entity15 at the end of the programme			1
as @entity15 start to play their single , the camera panned to the guests and mr @entity4 looked disinterested spotted : when the politician realises the camera is focused on him , he completely changes his body language			1
he looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music musical appreciation : @entity4 has now been mocked for ' attempts to look cool ' as he listens to keane but mr @entity4 is not the only politician to look awkward on the sofa when being played to by musicians on the show			1
@entity36 is seen engaging in some finger tapping when @entity39 winner @entity38 performed weeks earlier			0
in contrast prime minister @entity40 is a lot more reserved in his appreciation of the live music as his reaction to singer @entity46 shows in a clip from years earlier			2
however the funniest video is of the @entity49 performing their political song ' there ’s no - one as @entity52 as @entity53 ' in 2008			0
in the clip , @entity54 , who was shadow foreign secretary at the time , and the then deputy leader of the @entity56 , @entity55 , are in stitches on the sofa over the song			0
in the past politicians have been left with egg on their face over their public declarations of their favourite music			0
in 2010 , @entity40 was blasted by @entity66 ’ guitarist @entity65 for saying he liked the band			0
@entity65 took to @entity68 and said : ' @entity40 stop saying that you like @entity66			0
i forbid you to like it			0
' similarly former prime minister @entity72 was left embarrassed when he claimed to be a fan of rock band the @entity75 but admitted he could not name one of their songs			0
as the band start to play their single , @entity81 , the camera panned to the guests			1
originally there is no reaction from mr @entity4 who stared at the group looking nonplussed as these pictures show			1
but when the politician realises the camera is focused on him , he completely changes his body language			1
in cringe - worthy fashion the @entity91 mp looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music			1
the hilarious attempt to look interested has been mocked on @entity7 in a video titled ' @entity98 : @entity4			1
' in a humorous text commentary that accompanies the clip , it reads : ' the @entity13 loves to sign off with a bit of music			0
in this case @entity15 , led by their uncanny @entity40 lookalike			1
' as the band performs , the show ’s other guests watch from the sofa			0
' one of this week ’s guests was @entity4			1
what did @entity4 think ? not a rave review			2
' but watch his reaction when he realises the camera ’s on him			2
' the video has already had more than 1,200 hits and provoked some funny comments online			0
one wrote : ' the weeping angel of crowd - pleasing			0
' another person said ' i have watched this 3 times and shared it on @entity126 ... i do n't know why this ﻿ has tickled me so much ! ! ' favourite of the chancellor : @entity15 playing their new single @entity81 , in the @entity132 studio tv show : @entity132 left , introduced @entity15 , including lead singer @entity134 , right			2

as @entity15 start to play , @entity4 looks nonplussed - but when he realises the camera is on him , he starts bobbing his head in time to the music
