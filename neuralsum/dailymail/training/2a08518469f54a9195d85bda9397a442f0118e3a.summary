by @entity0 published : 22:37 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 23:22 est , 4 june 2013 the daughter of doctor who specializes in past life regression therapy believes she was healed of blinding cataracts by delving into her former existence as a man in the @entity8			1
@entity9 , daughter of ‘ @entity11 ’ author dr. @entity10 , never had any luck with her father ’s unusual practice of helping patients learn about themselves by reliving their past existences			1
but at 25 , the social worker was diagnosed with an eye cataract condition that doctors said could lead to complete blindness			0
with the bad news weighing on her , @entity9 decided to give past life regression another try			1
‘ i 'll see if i can figure out the source of my cataracts , ’ she recalls thinking as she attended one of her @entity42 educated father ’s regression workshops			2
at least , she thought , ‘ maybe i 'll have a good nap			0
' but as soon as her father instructed her to think back to the source of her cataracts , @entity9 closed her eyes and says she was transported to another place and time			1
scary diagnosis : @entity9 , a social worker , was 25 when she was diagnosed with potentially blinded cataracts but past life regression had never worked for her @entity52 : @entity9 decided to attend one of her father 's , right , workshops , hoping it would help her explore the source of her cataracts			1
' why do i have the eyes of an old man , ' she wondered ‘ immediately , i saw myself in the body of an old man with long white hair , living in the @entity8 , ’ she says			0
she was living alone in the hut far from a village			0
‘ basically a hermit , ’ she says			0
‘ but these townspeople thought i was a wizard and that i was doing evil			0
’ @entity9 says she saw the villagers storm her hut and set fire to everything she owned			2
‘ and the fire burned my eyes			0
it blinded me , ’ she says			0
‘ i could feel his pain			0
’ as she watched the atrocity play out before her , @entity9 says her father then initiated the workshop ’s next step , telling them to fast forward to the end of their previous body ’s life and ask what that life meant			1
@entity9 ’ eerie message was ' sadness clouds the eyes			2
’ angry villagers : the regression worked and @entity9 was transported to a hut like this one , where she lived as an old man hermit until angry villagers burned it , along with her eyes ‘ for me , ’ she says , ‘ that had a double meaning , not just that i had been carrying the cataracts and the literal blindness from the past life , but i had been carrying that man 's sadness in the present life too			1
’ then , as if her past life regression were n’t miraculous enough , something truly astounding happened			1
soon after the workshop , doctors told @entity9 that her cataracts , had healed			2
@entity9 ’s father , dr. @entity9 , told an equally amazing tale during his appearance on @entity32 ’s spirituality show , billed as an ‘ eye - opening and inspiring block of programming designed to help viewers awaken to their best selves and discover a deeper connection to the world around them			2
’ on the show , dr @entity9 recalled a day in 1980 he was using hypnotherapy to treat a woman for anxiety and depression			2
miracle : with her father 's help , @entity9 believes she was healed when her former self told her ' sadness clouds the eyes ' and her cataracts soon disappeared the room became ' icy cold ' as the patient began to channel messages from @entity138 ’ deceased family members - things she would not have known			2
' and she did n't know anything about me			0
i did n't even have diplomas in my office			0
' so she 's telling me your father 's here and your son ... it was before the @entity150 , before you could @entity152 your doctor			0
' the experience inspired dr. @entity9 to pursue a career path in past life regression			1
he now leads past life regression workshops and seminars and experiential workshops , and training sessions for professionals			1
he is the best - selling author of ' @entity162 , many masters ' about past lives			0
he also co-authored ‘ @entity11 ’ with daughter @entity9 , compilation of personal experiences of past life regression as sent to dr. @entity9 by people who ’ve attended his seminars			1
two of a kind : @entity9 's father dr. @entity10 has written two books on past life regression , the most recent of which ' miracles happen , ' he co-wrote with @entity9			1

@entity9 is the daughter of past life regression expert dr. @entity10
she reveals her miraculous experience , which she says helped cure her cataracts , on the own *network*
