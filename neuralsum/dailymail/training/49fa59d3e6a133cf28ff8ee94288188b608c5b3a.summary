millions of us know the feeling : we check into @entity6 to see what our friends are doing , only to feel a pang of envy at someone 's great new job , another person 's happy relationship or our former classmate 's big new house			0
but this seemingly harmless habit does n't just make us grumpy at that moment : it could be damaging our health			0
researchers at the @entity17 have found that the social network can lead to depression , especially amongst those who use @entity6 to size other people 's lives up against their own			1
' if it is used as a way to size up one 's own accomplishments against others , it can have a negative effect , ' said professor @entity41 , one of the professors who co-authored the research			0
' if @entity6 is used to see how well an acquaintance is doing financially or how happy an old friend is in his relationship - things that cause envy among users - use of the site can lead to feelings of depression			2
but report co-author professor @entity41 ( pictured ) says people can gird themselves against depression by realising people on social networks show their lives through a rose - tinted gloss ' it is important for @entity6 users to be aware of these risks so they can avoid this kind of behaviour when using @entity6			1
' @entity6 members were particularly stressed when their friends posted pictures of luxurious holidays , or used the social network to boast about new houses or expensive cars , the study found			1
however , professor @entity41 said @entity6 users could help gird themselves against depression by remembering that many of their ' friends ' on the social network are putting a rose - tinted gloss over their lives when they post there			1
' users should be self - aware that positive self - presentation is an important motivation in using social media , so it is to be expected that many users would only post positive things about themselves			2
this self - awareness , hopefully , can lessen feelings of envy , ' she said			0
she also noted that the social network could be a ' fun and healthy activity ' that has a ' positive effect ' on users ' well - being if they use it to stay connected with family and old friends			1
last year , @entity6 faced a storm of protests after the website conducted a secret experiment , filtering out positive content from some people 's so - called news feeds â€“ the constant flow of links , videos , pictures and comments by friends			0
people who saw less positive content were more likely to post negative content themselves , suggesting that they were unhappy , the study found			2
the research was conducted by the @entity114 and the @entity115 , but was overshadowed by a storm of controversy after people objected to having their newsfeeds manipulated .			0

study of 700 people finds the social network can lead to depression
even *higher* chance in those who compare their lives to other users
@entity17 researchers warn people to be careful
*facebook* users need to be aware of the risks , warn study authors
