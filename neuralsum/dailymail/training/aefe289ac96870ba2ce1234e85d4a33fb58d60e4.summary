by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 fans , your life just got a little easier			0
a @entity7 tech start - up has launched an app for @entity10 devices that lets people take photos of themselves without having to touch their screens			1
using touchless technology , which it says is ideal for taking ' selfies ' or ' groupies ' , @entity16 's @entity15 app lets users trigger photos or videos from a distance with just hand gestures			1
the company , based in the southern @entity7 city of @entity39 , says the free @entity15 app is currently only available in @entity7 and @entity41			1
over the past few years , gesture recognition has become more popular thanks to products such as @entity46 's @entity45 for video games			0
however , power - hungry technology has yet to become mainstream in computers or mobile devices			2
photos can be triggered from a distance of up to 10 feet ( 3 metres )			1
the company , based in the southern @entity7 city of @entity39 , says the free @entity15 app is currently only available in @entity7 and @entity41 the technology using something known as @entity57 software which detects and tracks different gestures			1
it does this using a video stream from the camera in the mobile phone , picking up on particular movements , such as a wave of a hand ' even though a number of handset vendors globally are integrating our touchless software for different features into their devices , we wanted to develop @entity74 in order to show the capabilities of gesture interaction also in the @entity79 environment , ' said @entity80 , chief executive of the group			1

' @entity57 requires no hardware changes and runs on all major mobile operating systems , the company writes on its website			2
' this makes it possible for the user to experience a new interaction paradigm in any mobile device			0
' too lazy to get up to switch the kettle on ? soon you may be able to simply raise your hand or nod your head from another room , and you ’ll be moments away from a fresh cup of tea			0
this is the hope of researchers at the @entity109 who have developed technology that will allow people to control household devices with simple gestures			2
the technology , named ‘ @entity115 ’ , is similar in concept to how @entity46 's @entity45 sensor works by using cameras to recognise gestures			2
by adapting a @entity121 router and wireless household devices , the researchers developed a system that can detect specific movements without the need for sensors or cameras			0
they claim it is simpler and cheaper than similar gesture - recognition technologies out of the 900 gestures performed , @entity115 accurately recognised 94 per cent of them			0
it was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver .			0

app tracks gestures via @entity140 camera using its touchless @entity57 software
@entity15 app can be triggered from a distance of up to 3 metres
the app was created by @entity16 , a start - up based @entity39 , @entity7
free technology is currently only available in @entity7 and @entity41
