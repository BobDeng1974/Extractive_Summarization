a new book has claimed that the @entity1 is in fact the tool of a capitalist patriarchy intent on altering and suppressing femininity			1
@entity7 author @entity6 has written ' sweetening the @entity1 : or how we got hooked on @entity9 ' and believes that a number of studies proves her point that contraception is in fact controlling women			1
she adds that women ’s unquestioning acceptance of such powerful medications is in some ways a submission to a culture steeped in hatred of the feminine			0
@entity6 has written ' sweetening the @entity1 : or how we got hooked on @entity9 '			2
she believes that a number of studies proves her point that contraception is in fact controlling women a book review by vice magazine writer @entity30 reveals that while ms @entity6 was on birth control she felt a distance between herself and her ‘ femaleness '			2
ms @entity6 said : ‘ over the years [ of being on the @entity1 ] i felt no connection between my self and my body , between my self and the world around me , between my femaleness and myself			2
’ a 2011 study of women both on and off hormonal contraception found that the medication did affect a woman 's memory			1
both sets of women were shown photos and told a story about a car accident involving a young boy and his subsequent hospital visit			0
studies have shown that the @entity1 affects both women 's choice of partner and her memory women on the pill remembered more of the emotional aspects of the story - the boy being hurt , what happened to him at the hospital - while the women who were not on the @entity1 were more likely to recall the details of the scene - what things looked like and where they were placed			1
ms @entity6 argues that if memory contextualises our past experiences and governs our future behaviour and understanding of the world , then a drug that alters it in even a slight way might have far - reaching consequences			0
indeed , the changing testosterone levels in a woman ’s body has been shown to affect women ’s choice of sexual partners and mates			1
a 2012 study revealed that women on hormonal birth control - which suppresses naturally occurring testosterone - were attracted to men with lower testosterone levels			1
however when women went off of the @entity1 , and their testosterone levels increased , their attraction to their feminine partners decreased			1
reviewer @entity30 agrees that the evidence does show that the hormonal contraception has powerful and life - altering side effects			0
and she adds that it ’s fair to wonder whether a drug that could alter our choice in long - term partners is ' too powerful for comfort '			0
but the reviewer says the @entity105 activist 's argument has its flaws			0
she says that it presumes that a woman is ' somehow entirely defined by her hormones , lack of hormones , or artificially achieved level of hormones			0
' that a woman could n’t possibly use her brain to decide to alter her hormones and that the hormonal levels once believed to rule women 's behaviour in such a way to make her nervous , emotional , and hysterical , once suppressed , rule her in an entirely different way			2
' the book is available in the @entity124 from september 7 and in the @entity7 from september 27 .			0

new book ' sweetening the pill : or how we got hooked on @entity9 ' says the @entity1 is a capitalist tool to alter and suppress femininity
