by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 04:50 est , 16 august 2012 a schoolboy who stunned his family with his bravery after he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour , has died this morning			1
@entity5 , 16 , who battled the disease for five years , had thought he had beaten the tumour in may this year			1
when he was told he had relapsed and would die in a matter of weeks , he stunned his relations by saying : ' you ca n’t win them all			2
' @entity5 slipped into a coma last saturday and died at 6.10am today - six weeks after doctors expected him to pass away			1
' he died surrounded by love at home , ' his mother @entity15 , who is a singing teacher , said			0
special evening : @entity5 was thrilled with the black limousine that arrived to take him to his school prom @entity5 , earlier this year with the family dog honey she also revealed on @entity22 she found her son 's will a few days before he died			1
he wanted his things to be shared between his siblings , @entity26 and @entity27 , with his collection of jellybeans to go to his younger sister			0
his ukulele was to go to a family friend			0
@entity5 was told at the beginning of june his condition was terminal and decided that he did n't want further chemotherapy			2
however , he was desperate to make his school prom on june 28			1
his mother @entity15 , 44 , was able to tell friends and supporters on @entity22 that he fulfilled his ambition			0
' @entity41 's done it ! grinning in black tie by pristine black limo on our dirty , bumpy farm track , ' she posted that evening			0
the limo was provided by the charity rays of @entity49 and marked the start of a very special night , during which @entity5 won the award for ' most optimistic person			1
' mrs @entity54 's @entity22 updates also revealed @entity5 's wish to be cremated and have his ashes scattered at a local watering hole			1
she also paid tribute to his extraordinary philosophical attitude to life			0
the day after his prom he told her : ' it 's funny how u ( sic ) realise the significance of your life just when you 're about to lose it			2
' later that day he said to his parents , @entity15 , 44 and @entity70 , 46 : ' i just want to say that i have very much enjoyed myself here ; thank you very much			0
' @entity5 , pictured surfing in @entity74			2
the trip was paid for by the charity @entity76 the teenager , from @entity78 , in @entity79 , had stopped going to school in may due to concentration problems caused by the tumour and said his only regret was not being able to do his biology a level			0
his memory worsened as time went on which meant he had to replace reading and playing the guitar with simpler tasks such as cooking			0
but he still shared precious exchanges with his family			0
his mother said his little sister would insist @entity5 play with her saying : ' you can rest when you 're dead			1
' @entity5 's mother , @entity99			1
she said @entity5 had shown her how to cope by being so strong then on 6 august , she recounted another bittersweet conversation : ' @entity41 me : " do i know u ? " me : " yes , very well			2
" @entity41 : " you look very like my mother			0
" me : " yes i certainly do			0
she 's marvellous ! " ' the family were helped by @entity108 nurses who provided much - needed nighttime relief and other support			1
they were also boosted by how well @entity112 did at the @entity113 , providing a much - needed distraction			0
mrs @entity5 and her family are backing the @entity118 awareness campaign run by @entity119 , to highlight the importance of detecting brain tumours in children at an early stage			1
although @entity5 displayed the symptoms of the disease when he was 11 , they were not simultaneous and it took five - and - a - half weeks to get a diagnosis			1
had it been detected sooner , the tumour would have been around half the size it was and @entity5 would have stood a much better chance of survival			2
the symptoms of the @entity135 brain tumour include vomiting , headaches , and unusual eye movements			0
children have the same risk of developing a brain tumour as meningitis			1
@entity5 's parents released a statement today that said : ' the @entity5 family are determined that everyone knows how to spot the signs of a brain tumour in a child / young person			1
' supporting the @entity151 is the fastest way to achieve this			0
this will save the lives of some of the two coachloads of children who die horribly every year from a brain tumour and massively improve the quality of life for those children , like @entity5 , who have to endure years of complex treatment			1
' they added : ' the family will never be able to express fully their gratitude & admiration to all of the doctors , nurses & support staff at @entity173 , @entity174 & @entity175 as well as the following charities : @entity177 , @entity108 , the @entity178 and @entity119 who started @entity151			2
