' if @entity1 want to keep @entity6 they must compensate the fund under the terms and deadlines set forth by the contract			1
if necessary we will not hesitate to use every legal resource at our disposal to fully defend our rights and interests			0
' naughty boy : @entity6 ( left ) is set to face disciplinary action from his club @entity1 @entity6 has become a key figure for @entity7 as @entity52 wants a left - sided centre - back who can bring the ball out of defence unlike @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
@entity7 are not confident at this stage in their ability to prise @entity62 from @entity63			0
they are the player 's best option should he leave but it is understood @entity66 would prefer other members of their foreign contingent to be sacrificed			0
@entity63 need one @entity71 player to go so they can recruit @entity72 from @entity73			0
any @entity7 move for @entity75 of @entity76 remains on the sidelines also at the moment			2
foot on the ball : any @entity7 move for @entity75 of @entity76 remains grounded for now @entity81 confident of keeping @entity75 @entity76 have made an enquiry for @entity85 centre - back @entity83 that could pave the way for @entity87 to sign @entity88 from @entity89 for £ 8million			1

they are not the only ones , though … in the last few days interesting proposals have also arrived from @entity106			0
at the back : with @entity83 potentially moving to @entity76 , @entity108 ( left ) could turn attention to @entity87 ' the price , pretty much , is this - we are not willing to negotiate for less than € 10m			1
we have not set a deadline			0
if we receive the right offer , we will sell him			0
otherwise , we will keep him			0
' the former @entity116 midfielder was asked if he was surprised by the attention now on @entity88 : ' no. we were certain that he would become a player in the international market , even more so after the great @entity120 with @entity121			2
' his preferred destination ? @entity76 are top of his wishes , but @entity88 has an emotional attachment to @entity89			1
he has a deal with the president , he will accept the team that will meet the economic needs of the club			0
be that @entity76 or an @entity100 club			2

he is so fast he could play at the back by himself ! ' @entity134 and @entity135 have expressed interest in free agent @entity137 but face competition from @entity140 side @entity139			1
the 26 - year - old @entity141 has an offer from @entity89 also but the prospect of playing in the @entity144 again or the @entity140 is more appealing			0
strike : @entity137 is still a free agent , but could be on his way back to the @entity144 @entity148 's search for defensive re-inforcements has led them to @entity151 's @entity150			1
