a man who faked his own death in an £ 850,000 life insurance scam is attempting to dodge deportation by claiming his ‘ right to a family life ’ – despite the fact he has split from his wife			1
the 59 - year - old fraudster , who can only be identified by the initials ‘ @entity9 ’ , was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of faking his own death to start a new life in abroad			1
the father - of - four - who is originally from @entity13 but was living in @entity14 , @entity15 , at the time of the offence – was jailed after being convicted of fraud totalling £ 850,000 at @entity19 in 2012			2
the man is claiming he should not be deported to his home country of @entity13 because he has a ' right to a private and family life ' under @entity23 the court heard how he took out a £ 500,000 life insurance policy , several personal loans and ran up large debts on seven different credit cards before his wife – ‘ sl ’ – told his employers he had suffered a fatal heart attack while on holiday			1
his life insurance policy paid out and all his debts were wiped after she handed officials his death certificate – but the pair were caught out when investigators found his fingerprints on the document			1
‘ @entity9 ’ was then extradited from @entity42 - where he had fled to start a new life under an assumed identity – and jailed			0
his wife was also jailed for two years for her involvement in the elaborate plot			0
however , after being convicted , ‘ @entity9 ’ was put up for ‘ automatic deportation ’ by home secretary @entity48 who said he should be removed from @entity50 under rules which state that any foreign criminal jailed for more than 12 months should be deported			1
he appealed the decision , arguing that being deported was a violation of his right to private and family life under @entity23			2
he also said he would face ill - treatment in his home country and claimed asylum under @entity61 , which protects against torture , inhuman or degrading treatment			0
his case was initially rejected by immigration judges but he appealed again and the @entity66 and @entity67 said the decision on @entity69 was ‘ fatally flawed ’			0
home secretary @entity48 ( above ) said the man should be removed from @entity50 under rules which state that any foreign criminal who is jailed for more than 12 months should be automatically deported the case is now due to be heard again , meaning he could potentially be allowed to remain in @entity50 indefinitely if officials rule his human rights have been violated			2
he continues to fight for the right to a private and family life , despite reportedly having abandoned his family following his conviction			2
conservative mp @entity83 , who is campaigning for human rights laws to be reformed , described the situation as ‘ crazy ’			0
he told @entity86 : ‘ it 's crazy that , yet again , the immigration tribunal is allowing a convicted fraudster who abandoned his family to claim a right to family life to trump the public interest in seeing him removed from @entity50			1
‘ worse still , the tribunal is airbrushing details of the individual , eroding the principle of open justice , which is vital to retaining public confidence			0
’ a @entity101 spokesman said : ‘ we remain at appeal and will be advised by the tribunal about a new hearing date in due course			0

the 59 - year - old fraudster faked his own death to forge a new life abroad
his wife told officials he had suffered a fatal heart attack while on holiday
couple got hefty life insurance *payout* but were caught by investigators
man , from @entity13 , was jailed for five years and put up for deportation
but he claims his ' right to a family life ' means he should be able to stay in @entity50
