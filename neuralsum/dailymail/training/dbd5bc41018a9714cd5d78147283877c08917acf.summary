by @entity0 last updated at 12:13 pm on 9th january 2012 presenter : @entity2 who reads an intimate excerpt from her diary a @entity6 documentary about teenage sex which follows a girl hoping to lose her virginity has been branded a ' freak show '			1
the hour - long programme , which includes the f - word and discussions about oral sex and sex aids , is due to be screened on @entity16 on thursday			1
but the @entity17 is under pressure not to screen @entity2 : like a virgin , which is scheduled to go out immediately after the 9pm watershed			2
' the show is ­ terrible , almost a freak show , ' @entity23 , of tv watchdog @entity24 , told the @entity25			1
' it ’s also irresponsible , inappropriate , disturbing and even exploitative towards some of those featured in it			1
' for a programme clearly aimed at a teenage audience it is extremely irresponsible not to include any ­ discussion of safe sex			1
' @entity24 believes there is a danger the @entity38 code could be flouted by using material harmful to the ' moral development ' of under 18 - year - olds			2
former minister @entity42 has joined ms @entity23 in condemning the programme , which is part of the @entity6 's @entity45			1
she said : ' the @entity6 should not screen this programme			1
it seems to me that they are just trying to set new boundaries and to do this at 9pm when a lot of young people will still be up is horrendous			0
' shamed : @entity54 and @entity55 who had to make an apology to @entity57 over an offensive prank phone call ms @entity23 , who is to make an official complaint to the @entity6 and @entity38 , claimed the show was ' prurient and exploitative '			2
she added : ' it is extraordinary that in following a teenager getting ready to lose her virginity , a bikini wax is filmed as an essential part of her preparation but condoms are not even mentioned			0
@entity68 it : @entity42 has urged the @entity6 not to screen the show ' the programme promises " essential truths amongst the tales of sex and debauchery , to see if losing your virginity is about more than just ­ having sex for the first time "			1
' however , it delivers an inconclusive mix of titillating detail and voyeuristic confessional			0
' the @entity6 was fined £ 150,000 for breaching @entity38 's code when @entity84 and @entity54 used offensive language during prank calls to @entity57 on @entity87			2
the controversial programme begins with @entity2 , 31 , a former @entity89 pupil , reading from her diary when she was 16			2
she reads : “ i ’m going to * * * * @entity91			0
' it introduces a young man , @entity93 , from a jazz band who shows her a condom described as a ' willy hat ' and jokes with her about sexual positions			0
she then hosts a discussion with a group of young men , one of whom claims he had oral sex with a woman outside @entity108			1
@entity109 , a 17 - year - old virgin , is filmed having a bikini wax before going on holiday			0
ms @entity23 said : “ she is packed off to @entity112 to lose her virginity without even a condom			0
' ms @entity42 told the @entity25 : ' it is difficult to see how parents and teachers have any chance at all of getting young people to behave responsibly if this is the sort of stuff the @entity6 is promoting			1
' it will not help with efforts to reduce teenage pregnancy rates in @entity125 , which are the highest in @entity126			0
' a @entity128 spokesman claimed the programme was likely to anger people who believed that sexual activity should be confined within a faithful , heterosexual marriage			0
a @entity6 spokeswoman said : ' @entity2 : like a virgin adheres to @entity6 editorial guidelines and is scheduled appropriately with a strong language warning prior to transmission			0

programme includes f - word and talk about oral sex
' it 's irresponsible and exploitative ' says tv watchdog
