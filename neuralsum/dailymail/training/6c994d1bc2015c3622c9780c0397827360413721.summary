it ’s unlikely the majority of us are so overwhelmed with tweets , @entity5 posts , emails and texts that we need someone - or something - to reply on our behalf			1
however , this has n’t stopped @entity13 filing a patent for a system that would do just that			1
according to the details of the latest patent filed by a software engineer at the firm , @entity13 ’s automated system would work like a social media bot and submit posts on a user ’s behalf			1
would you let a robot send emails on your behalf ? @entity13 's latest patent describes a system that generates automated replies to online conversations			1
it would do this by scanning social networks , emails and texts to learn how to write in a way that mimics your language and tone in august a patent was approved that could see @entity13 tracking , and making money from , the eye movements of its @entity48 owners			1
the @entity50 patent shows the device tracking where the wearer looks , how long they look at an item , and even how much their pupils dilate			0
information about where the user is looking could then be sent to @entity13 's servers where an image scanning algorithm would identify what they are looking at , create a log of everything they 've viewed , and potentially use this information to serve adverts			2
it would do this by scanning that user ’s previous posts and replies on sites such as @entity5 , @entity74 and @entity75 , as well as their emails and texts messages , to learn how that person writes			1
the bot would then write replies and responses to future posts in a way that mimics that person ’s usual language and tone			1
the more a person uses the system , the more the bot can learn the type of responses they write and this would make the suggestions sound more human and realistic			2
this would also potentially involve the bot scanning posts written by friends and family too , and could have significant privacy implications			2
@entity101 , director of @entity102 , told @entity103 : ' technology like this must only ever be opt - in , as it has the potential to allow companies like @entity13 to harvest even more data from your private communications to enable automatic posting to sound authentic			0
' if you regularly send a text message about a certain type of medication or email a lawyer with words like ‘ divorce ’ appearing , the computer can quite easily identify you to a human searching through the data looking for certain things			0
@entity13 has already been criticised for scanning the content of emails in its @entity126 service for advertising purposes so it could , in theory , do the same with posts , emails and text messages			2
@entity13 has already been criticised for spying on the content of emails in its @entity126 service for advertising purposes and could , in theory , do the same with this system			2
it would also potentially involve the bot scanning posts written by friends and family too , and could have privacy implications @entity101 continued : ' that sort of data is valuable to both governments and companies , so i ’m extremely concerned about any technology that purports to offer convenience while in reality exposing more of our private communications to prying eyes			0
' there are already bots capable of automating responses to emails , blog posts or comments but @entity13 ’s system would make the process more personalised			1
according to the patent : ‘ there is no requirement for the user to set reminders or be proactive			0
‘ the system automatically , without user input , analyses information to which the user has access , and generates suggestions for personalised reactions to messages			0
’ however , the system would n’t be completely automated			0
a user would have to approve a suggestion made by the bot before it is posted in their name			0
suggestions could also be rejected , which again would help the bot learn what kinds of posts are appropriate .			0

the patent was filed by a @entity13 software engineer on behalf of the firm
it describes a system that analyses a user ’s online posts , emails and texts
the system , or bot , would then generate automated replies for future posts
these replies would be written in a way that mimics that person 's usual language and tone
