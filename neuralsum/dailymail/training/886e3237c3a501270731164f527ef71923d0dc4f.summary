@entity39 , @entity3 ’s husband , said her death was ‘ such a shock ’ and highlighted the potential risk involved with bariatric surgery			1
the cancer nurse , aged 47 , said : ' when @entity3 had her operation , it was still relatively new and doctors are now finding more patients developing problems further down the line			1

mr @entity39 said : ' we ’d almost given up hope			0
you name the diet , @entity3 had tried it			1
she had hormone problems and was given the opportunity to have an operation			2
' a gastric by - pass makes the stomach smaller , meaning patients feel full more quickly and reduces the amount of calories absorbed by the bowel			2

mr @entity39 said : ' @entity3 was so proud			2
she was fantastic , everything you would want in a mum			0
' but unfortunately her health got worse			0
' mrs @entity3 's weight loss became too extreme and she complained of muscle pains and tiredness			2
doctors prescribed supplements for a lack of nutrients such as copper and vitamin d , thought to be a side effect of the surgery , but her health continued to decline and she developed a rare and deadly listeria infection in her blood			1
mr @entity39 said : ' the listeria really wiped her out			0
i asked the consultants if they had any idea how it got there and they said no. it ’s a rare infection , they could only say it was probably related to the surgery			1
' she spent @entity133 in hospital and went into cardiac arrest on @entity136			0
doctors managed to revive her but her brain was severely damaged due to a lack of oxygen			2
happier times : @entity86 and @entity3 pictured on their wedding day in 2006 photograph of @entity3 and her husband @entity86 taken on their wedding day in @entity148 in 2006 @entity3 photographed in @entity149 in 2008 after she had a gastric - bypass operation loving mother : @entity3 with daughter @entity26 pictured in @entity152 in 2010 mrs @entity3 's parents @entity154 and @entity155 and her brother @entity156 gathered at her bedside when she died on january 3			1

mr @entity39 said : ' i just wish that she had managed to lose that weight some other way - i wish it more than anything in the world			2
@entity3 was admitted to the @entity31 in @entity12 where she died earlier this month ' but unfortunately that was n't the case			1
she tried absolutely everything - diets , exercise - everything			2
' when @entity3 had @entity26 we expected it would be the start of a long and happy family life together			1
' i do n't want to pin any blame on the operation because they did their best and we did manage to conceive as a direct result of the operation			2
' but my daughter does n't have a mummy because of the operation that gave her life			2
' i have mixed emotions about the operation			2
i just wish she could have found another way to lose the weight			0
' for anybody considering this surgery , my advice would be not to take the decision lightly			0
' @entity39 holding a photo of his wife @entity3 who had gastric - bypass surgery so she could give birth a gastric - bypass is when the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach so you digest less food and it takes much less food to make you feel full			1
people with a gastric - bypass will lose around two - thirds of their excess body weight			0
procedures help the patient feel satisfied on smaller quantities of food and helps reducing hunger in between meals			0
some operations affect hormonal changes , which cause changes in women ’s appetite			0
surgery can now be offered to anyone with a @entity219 over 40 , where lifestyle and medication have been ineffective			0
it also significantly reduces the health risks of women who have severe and complicated obesity			0
women are advised not to become pregnant within 18 months of having had weight - loss surgery			1
it is also true that , despite the advice to avoid pregnancy within a year of surgery , many women do become pregnant and go on to have a successful pregnancy			1
but during this time , nutritional deficiencies can occur			0
however , it is usual for all patients to be prescribed multivitamin and mineral supplements , and sometimes at higher doses			0
after weight - loss surgery most of the weight loss takes place in the first 12 - 18 months			2
it is best to avoid pregnancy in this period , as the effects of weight loss on the baby are still not fully understood			0
for women who had surgery more than two years previously , weight is likely to have stabilised			0
women who are obese are less likely to conceive naturally and when receiving treatment for infertility require higher doses of gonadotrophins and more days of ovarian stimulation to achieve the desired pregnancy rates			0
obesity also impacts negatively on pregnancy and is associated with increased risk of gestationaldiabetes , hypertension , pre-eclampsia , the need for induced labour and caesarean delivery .			0
