@entity6 , 27 , was given strict instructions to stay two metres from anyone after she underwent a pioneering programme of treatment for thyroid cancer which left her emitting harmful rays			1
she was initially hospitalised in an isolation ward but doctors allowed her to return home - as long as she did not go near her six - year - old daughter or one - year - old twins			0
@entity6 ( pictured with husband , @entity19 , and their three children ) was unable to cuddle her children after cancer treatment made her radioactive but now , after three long weeks , the mother from @entity25 , @entity26 , has been given the all - clear meaning she can finally kiss and cuddle her children once more			1
mrs day said : ‘ it was amazing just being able to hug my children again			0
the week before had been really difficult			0
‘ i was really surprised when the doctors told me i had the all - clear , and i certainly did n't expect it to happen that quickly			1
‘ they were a bit surprised themselves			0
‘ i was really struggling with not being able to be near my children , and it was really emotional especially when the children were crying and i could n't go to them			0
’ mrs day said she rushed home to cuddle her children as soon as doctors told her it was safe			2
for three weeks she had to stay at least two metres from the children meaning she had to watch from a distance while her husband , @entity19 , played with them mrs day had to take high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer			1
this was the second time she had fought cancer as she suffered from leukaemia as a child ‘ people sometimes take their children for granted and just to be able to hug them again was a perfect moment , ’ she added			2
mrs day was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer in january this year after seeing a doctor for a lump in her throat			1
it is the second time she has battled cancer , after defeating leukaemia as a child			0
she first thought the lump in her throat was a swollen gland but doctors soon realised the six - centimetre growth was cancerous after an operation to remove half of it			0
mrs day ( pictured with her husband , @entity19 , and their eldest daughter on the couple 's wedding day ) was diagnosed with thyroid cancer after finding a lump in her throat as part of her treatment , mrs day underwent a pioneering programme which saw her placed in an isolation unit at @entity82			1
for her particular type of cancer , some patients receive radioactive iodine treatment – a form of internal radiotherapy			1
the treatment involves a radioactive form of the element called iodine 131 , administered as a drink or capsule , which circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream			2
thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body , and the radiation kills them			1
other cells are left unaffected , because only thyroid cells take up the iodine			2
she had now been given the all - clear and can cuddle her children again - she will have another scan in six months time to ensure that the cancer has not returned she was initially so radioactive anything she touched inside had to be thrown away and she had only a phone for company			1
she was allowed home three weeks ago , but was forced to watch from a distance as her children played and were looked after by her family			0
throughout her treatment mrs day kept a blog and more than 80 bloggers rallied around her , posting messages of support			0
she said : ‘ my blog became therapy for me because i could share how i was feeling			0
they have been there to support me and to cheer me up , and i am very thankful for that			0
‘ i have only met a few of them , but they were really encouraging during those days			0
’ mrs day will have a scan in six months to see whether she will have to undergo the treatment again , but for now she is determined to make the most of being close to her family			0
radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy			1
the treatment uses a radioactive form of iodine called iodine 131 ( @entity135 )			2
the radioactive iodine circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream			1
radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy , administered as a capsule or drink thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body			1
the radiation in the iodine then kills the cancer cells			2
radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment			1
it does n't affect other body cells , because only thyroid cells take up the iodine			2
the treatment is usually administered as a drink or capsule			0
patients having radioactive iodine treatment in hospital are looked after in a single room until their radiation levels have fallen again			1
the treatment causes the patient to be slightly radioactive for a few days , so time spent with staff and visitors is minimal			2
sweat and urine also become radioactive , so bedsheets are changed every day and patients have to flush the loo more than once			0
pregnant women and young children will not be allowed to visit			0
even 12 weeks after treatment , patients who have had radioactive iodine therapy may set off radiation alarms at airports .			1
