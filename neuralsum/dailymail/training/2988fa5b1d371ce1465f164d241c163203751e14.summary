it is the night that millions have been waiting for with excitement ... and trepidation			2
@entity5 ’s footballers play their first game of the @entity7 tonight in front of a global tv audience of three billion , 20million of them in the @entity11			2
perfect barbecue weather is forecast for much of the country ahead of the match in which @entity16 ’s boys will take on @entity17 in @entity18			1
but there are also fears that the tournament could lead to ugly scenes in some town centres thanks to a controversial decision to extend pub opening hours			2
a third of those planning to watch the game in the @entity11 are expected to be in a pub or bar , and police and paramedics are braced for a rise in alcohol - fuelled violence			1
they point to a potentially toxic mix of warm weather and the fact that the government has allowed pubs to open late to cater for the 11pm kick off			1
one leading medical figure , dr @entity54 , said the decision ‘ makes no sense ’			2
thousands of extra police officers are being deployed around the country as forces put on extra patrols to clamp down on drunken thuggish behaviour			1
@entity62 : @entity63 from @entity64 arrives at the airport in @entity23 - and things are heating up back home too preparations : police motorbikes have also lined the streets surrounding the @entity72 stadium in @entity23 the @entity73 plans to run special ‘ booze buses ’ – which look similar to mini-vans – that can accommodate six drunks at a time			1
@entity78 said it is treating tonight like a ‘ @entity79 ’			1
licensing laws are being relaxed during @entity5 ’s @entity7 matches after a personal intervention from the prime minister , so every pub and bar is free to open late without having to apply for a special licence			1
dr @entity54 , president of the @entity87 , called it an unwelcome move which was likely to lead to violence and abusive behaviour			2
the flag of @entity93 will fly over 10 @entity94 for @entity5 ’s @entity7 matches , in a show of support for @entity16 ’s team			0
although the gesture is well - intentioned , @entity100 and company may not welcome the prime ministerial endorsement – for they could now be struck by the @entity103			1
the @entity82 , who visited the @entity5 team at their @entity106 training base before they left for @entity18 , has been blamed for jinxing @entity107 , @entity108 and a string of other sportsmen and women with good luck messages during his time in office			0
in an article in the @entity116 he said : ‘ the consequences of alcohol abuse are seen daily in the country ’s emergency departments and manifest themselves as injuries , as well as acute and chronic illnesses			1
‘ this temporary relaxation of the licensing laws ... sets a precedent that those with vested interests can use to encourage the exception to become the norm			0
‘ those vested interests ... must not be allowed to peddle the notion that sporting events are best enjoyed with alcohol			0
’ retailers , however , were hoping to do even better than the last @entity7 in @entity134 in 2010 , not least because of greater consumer confidence in the improving economy			0
sales of widescreen tvs at @entity139 have almost doubled ahead of the event			1
more than 5,000 diehard @entity5 fans have travelled to the steamy @entity143 city of @entity23 for tonight ’s game			0
they have been asked to pay between £ 300 and £ 500 a night for basic hotel rooms that would normally cost just £ 40			0
hundreds more stayed in @entity147 and gathered on @entity148			0
@entity5 ’s players have been training at @entity23 ’s 46,000 capacity @entity72 stadium in @entity153 heat and 84 per cent humidity			0
incredibly last night there were still finishing touches being put to a stadium that should have been completed and tested more than a year ago			0
@entity16 ’s team are among the tournament ’s underdogs			0
but their millions of fans back home will be praying they make it through the group to at least the quarter - finals of the competition @entity5 have not won since the glory days of 1966			1
two storeys , three lions : a house in @entity172 bedecked with patriotic banners in preparation for the match banners on the balconies : residents on an estate in @entity180 , south east @entity181 , went for an ordered look united nations : the @entity185 pub in @entity186 , @entity187 , was smothered in national flags waving the flag of @entity93 : a house decorated with the red cross in @entity192 , @entity193 spot the house : a blizzard of flags cover an entire home in @entity197 thanks to resident @entity198 the two faces of the tournament : in an image that sums up a nation of contrasts , @entity18 fans toss rubbish into a bin where a woman hunts for food			2
it was posted online as protests raged over the cost of the @entity7			0
