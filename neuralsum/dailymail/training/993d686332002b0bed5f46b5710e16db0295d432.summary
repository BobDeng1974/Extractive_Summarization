by @entity0 flicking a peace sign is said to be the most - popular photo pose among the youth of @entity4 , so it 's no wonder this stone @entity7 statue in @entity9 has gained huge popularity			1
the 24ft - tall @entity11 , located in the 104th cave of the famous @entity13 in @entity14 , appears to be posing with two fingers raised			2
it is one of an estimated 100,000 statues of the @entity7 and his disciples carved into the living rock of the 1,400 caves at @entity13 , which date back nearly 2,000 years			1
pass the incense , man : this ancient stone @entity7 has gained new popularity thanks to it 's ' peace ' gesture that would make is far older than the peace sign , which was first popularised as ' @entity30 ' in @entity31 during the @entity32 , but then reversed in meaning by the peace movement in the @entity35 during the 1960s			1
at the same time as president @entity38 was flashing the gesture to prematurely claim victory in the @entity41 , protesters flicked it palm out to call for an end to the conflict			0
it is said to have spread in @entity4 during the post-war allied occupation of @entity48 , and from there , through cultural dissemination , across the rest of east @entity4			0
nowadays , youths from @entity52 to @entity9 , and further afield , make the gesture as an almost instinctive reaction to finding themselves in the sights of a photographer			0
