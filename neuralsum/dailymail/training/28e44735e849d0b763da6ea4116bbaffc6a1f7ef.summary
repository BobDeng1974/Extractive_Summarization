hunting for your charger and a free plug socket could soon be a thing of the past			0
this is according to two electricians , who have designed the world ’s first portable turbine phone charger that lets people charge their mobile phone using wind power alone			1
in fact , the generator can power up any item that requires a usb charger for power			2
instead , the product folds together into a 12 - inch ( 30 cm ) cylinder			1
it then unfolds into a vertical turbine that be used to charge usb devices			1
inside the turbine is a battery that holds 15,000 mah and a 15 - watt generator			2
to open the blades , you first need to pull out the legs and arrange them in a tripod or flat			0
this will then enable the blades to catch the wind and spin , generating power			1
plugging a usb device into the base of the turbine will then charge it			2
to close it up , the legs are pushed back in and the blades closed automatically			0
to open the product you pull out the aluminium legs and arrange them either into a tripod or on a flat surface			0
at the top of the legs is a turbine with three blades			0
these capture the wind and spin , providing green energy for a generator that can supply to 15 watts of power			0
there is also an internal battery that can store energy if you do n’t need it right away			0
the inventors claim when fully - charged the turbine can charge your phone four to six times			1
once the turbine is out of juice you can either charge it using the wind or plug it into a wall output , although obviously for clean energy purposes the former is preferred			2
the company is currently running a @entity79 project for funding , and they hope to be able to launch the portable turbine commercially by the start of next year			0
the @entity19 portable wind turbine unfolds to provide clean energy for your phone by harnessing the power of the wind			1
when spun the rotating blades charge the turbine , which can then be used to power mobile phones inside the turbine is a 15 - watt generator that powers a 15,000 mah battery			1
on the base of the turbine is one @entity96 plug into which you can plug a usb device the turbine can be unfolded wherever you are , so as long as you 've got a breeze you 'll be able to charge your phone			1
the legs can also be laid flat on surfaces			0

@entity19 is a portable wind turbine that can charge usb devices
*created* by @entity108 electricians @entity109 and @entity110
the power **station** folds into a 12 - inch cylinder when not in use
when unfolded , blades are used to catch the wind and charge the **station**
usb devices like *smartphones* can then be plugged in and charged
