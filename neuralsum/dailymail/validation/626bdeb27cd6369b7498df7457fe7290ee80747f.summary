a group of patients who criticised their local gp surgery on @entity3 have been told to consider finding a new doctor in an attempt to stifle negative feedback online			1
staff at the @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10 , had been monitoring social media comments and culprits have since been sent ' threatening ' letters			1
@entity14 , 35 , had written that on three occasions she waited for 90 minutes for an appointment for her newborn baby			1
but she was later accused of abusive behaviour by the surgery who branded it ' inappropriate patient behaviour ' and warned her that she should consider finding an ' alternative practice '			1
row : @entity25 , left , and @entity14 , right with son @entity26 , have been told to consider finding a new gp after their surgery saw their criticism online spark : surgery staff were obviously monitoring comments on @entity3 and sent a letter on the back of this one mrs @entity14 had said ' @entity35			1
demand a recount ! ' in a comment on a glowing report for the surgery from health watchdog the @entity41 on her local paper 's facebook page			2
a fortnight later a letter sent to her home from the surgery said : ' we have a zero tolerance for inappropriate patient behaviour which is either face to face , over the telephone or on social media networks and do not accept this from our patients			1
' a copy of her @entity3 criticism was also attached			1
warning : this letter from gp partner @entity60 has also been sent to other critics several other patients also received a letter			1
mrs @entity14 said : ' on three occasions i have been left sat in the waiting room for an hour and a half with a screaming newborn baby			2
' when i saw that the surgery had been praised i was shocked			0
i do n't rate them			0
' we 're mothers of young children living in the village			0
it 's the only surgery			0
i think they should take the criticism and use it to make the surgery better			1
' people might receive that threatening letter and think they are being chucked out			0
' another patient , @entity25 , 34 , was left upset by her letter , which came after she described months of poor service at the surgery in an online comment			1
she said : ' i have had mistake after mistake			0
i did n't think what i put was bad			0
it 's our opinion - that 's what social media is for			0
' several more people say they have received the letter , signed by gp partner dr @entity95 , which argues that complaints should go through the proper channels			2
the letter says : ' the partners at the practice are aware of your comments and how you feel			2
we have zero tolerance for inappropriate patient behaviour which is either face to face , over the telephone or on social media networks and do not accept this from our patients			2
' the letter invites recipients to speak to the patient liaison manager and one of the gp partners , but adds ' in the absence of such a meeting , it is felt you might give consideration to finding an alternative practice to receive your general medical services '			1
response : the surgery 's management says that it has a ' zero tolerance ' on abuse and says patients should complain through them a spokesman for @entity132 surgery said he was unable to comment on individual cases but said that the letter was proportionate			2
