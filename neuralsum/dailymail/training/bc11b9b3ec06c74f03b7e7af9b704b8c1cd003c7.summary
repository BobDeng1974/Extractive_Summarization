orbiting up to 270 miles is a long way from home			0
among the many creature comforts missed by the astronauts , the most popular request is a good cup of coffee			0
but the wait will soon be over , as one @entity11 astronaut prepares to take an @entity13 machine with her to perk up the crew			1
an @entity11 astronaut is bringing an @entity13 machine ( pictured ) with her to the iss. it is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on @entity1 the @entity23 machine uses a normal @entity25 coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			1
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			2
' astronauts drink the coffee straight from the pouch using a straw			0
@entity41 captain @entity40 is set to be not only be the first @entity11 woman to go into space , but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic espresso in orbit			1
she will be blasted to the space research laboratory in november , together with the drinks machine			2
it will be the second long - term mission of the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) aboard the space station			0
coffee company @entity55 worked with engineering firm and space food specialists @entity59 , as well as the , @entity53 to build a coffee machine to bring @entity11 espresso to the @entity0 it is befittingly called @entity13 , and is the first coffee machine able to work in micro gravity on the @entity0 , where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on @entity1			1
the prototype machine is currently being tested			0
it uses a ‘ capsule system ’ to fill plastic pouches with espresso and other hot drinks such as tea			2
the machine can also be used to rehydrate food			1

the drinks will be made using this specially - designed machine			2
a typical model weighs 29lbs ( 13kg ) , but this model weighs around 44lbs ( 20kg ) in order to handle liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space environment , the plastic tubing inside the normal coffee machines has been replaced with a steel tubes designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar			1
the @entity23 machine uses a standard coffee capsule , which is posted in the top of the machine			1
water is aspirated and pressurised in a unique electrical system and is then heated			0
the granules mix with the hot water and the coffee is piped into a pouch , which is securely fastened to the machine using a ' rapid coupling / uncoupling system			0

the machine is much heavier than a normal model , which typically weighs 29lbs ( 13kg )			0
the space - bound machine weighs around 44lbs ( 20kg ) because there are backups of all the critical components , for safety reasons , and in accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the @entity53 hovering up to 270 miles ( 435 km ) above the @entity1 , the @entity0 ( pictured ) is a long way from home and astronauts have reported missing creature comforts such as coffee and beer ‘ @entity13 represents a technologically high - value project which , besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts ’ menu , will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid dynamics and conditions in microgravity , ’ its makers said			1
‘ @entity11 coffee is a beverage without borders and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into space for some time , ’ said @entity55 , vice president of @entity25			2
ten years ago the company produced artwork designed to look like its coffee was in space , and ‘ today we are in a position to overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso ... on board the @entity0 , ’ he continued			1
@entity165 , managing director of @entity59 added that the firm is also taking care of the @entity169 astronauts ’ training and nutrition			0
‘ food provides an important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good @entity11 espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed especially for each astronaut , helping him or her to feel closer to home			1

@entity11 astronaut @entity40 will take the machine to the @entity0 in november
it is designed to work in microgravity and serves drinks in pouches
the machine uses standard coffee capsules and can rehydrate food
*re-enforced* pipes can withstand higher pressures and weighs 44lbs ( 20kg )
