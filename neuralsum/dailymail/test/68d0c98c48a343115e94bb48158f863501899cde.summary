there will be a white - hot atmosphere at @entity2 on saturday afternoon when @entity3 come to town but @entity5 has got to keep his emotions in check			1
this is about what happens on the pitch , not the touchline			0
the @entity3 boss is a passionate man but he ca n’t afford to let things get personal			1
he did a good job at @entity15 — he ’s never afraid to talk about having the best @entity17 win percentage of any @entity15 boss — but was still not trusted with the job long - term			0
he was in charge of the youth set - up for years and the club are now reaping the rewards with a team full of academy players , but he is more than just a company man			1
@entity3 manager @entity5 returns to @entity2 to face @entity15 this weekend when he was finally given a shot at the top job his personality came flooding through			1
incredibly driven and extremely confident , he did not take long to make a mark but it was an uneasy relationship and did not last long			0
that was a shame , because he is talented and i like to see as many former players as possible in managerial roles			0
there is so much knowledge to harness			0
at @entity3 , he has set the emotional bar high but it ’s working			1
@entity3 were lacking confidence all season and it looked like they lacked the ambition to win games			1
@entity5 ’s intensity has sparked them back to life			1
he has revived @entity49 in the same way as he did for @entity51 last season			2
@entity5 clearly targets players he feels can make the biggest impact and sets to work			2
@entity5 lets his feelings be known as he celebrates a goal at @entity57 against @entity58 @entity5 launches his jacket to the ground in celebration after @entity3 pulled level against @entity58 @entity5 grimaces as the @entity3 mascot - wearing the famous @entity5 gilet - embraces him the big @entity65 has seven goals in five games and looks a top player again			1
he was not affecting games but now his team - mates find him early			0
there ’s nothing wrong with being direct and @entity49 is a beast when you get him on the ball			1
@entity5 is still searching for a balance in midfield but he has given @entity78 a chance and still has an eye on youth with talent such as @entity83 coming through			2
@entity85 ’s emotional style can be great for a player — his antics on the touchline prove how much it means to him — but it has its drawbacks			2
he is never afraid to tell his players what he thinks of them			0
that encourages some but footballers can be sensitive souls			0
the @entity3 squad wo n’t like being called ‘ icing - on - the - cake players ’ and i ’m sure a few at @entity15 will remember being told they ‘ lack character ’ and ‘ are too nice ’			1
@entity5 certainly knew how to get the best out of @entity15 striker @entity51 big @entity65 international @entity49 is another striker enjoying working under @entity5 when i was at @entity102 and @entity103 came back to the club as @entity106 boss , there was an extra determination to beat him			1
i expect @entity15 to be exactly the same with @entity5			2
there ’s no doubt he ’s talented but he has to be careful not to let his emotions get the better of him			0
@entity111 told me when they worked together at @entity15 , @entity5 needed a calming influence alongside him , as long as it was a peer he could respect			2
@entity111 was the perfect foil			0
do n’t be surprised if @entity5 appoints someone like @entity111 at @entity3			1
it will be interesting to see what kind of reception @entity85 gets on saturday			0
but with @entity3 staring at a relegation battle this is not about unfinished business or gilet throwing			0
this is about the result			0
that ’s why @entity5 has to keep his cool			1
@entity5 shouts at his players as they look to earn an important victory at home to @entity58 @entity5 shares a smile with @entity111 during their time at @entity2 together			0

@entity5 is a passionate man but he ca n’t afford to let things get personal
at new club @entity3 , he has set the emotional bar high but it ’s working
@entity49 has found a new lease of life at the @entity141 outfit
