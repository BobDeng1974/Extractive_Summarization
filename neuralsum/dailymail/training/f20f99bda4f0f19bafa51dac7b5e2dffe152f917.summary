' we ’re infidels , we ’re absolutely that and we were there who did not subscribe to the doctrine or belief system [ the enemy ] was trying to impose			0
' we do n’t subscribe to terrorism , shariah law and oppression			0
we are champions of freedom , and if that makes us infidels good for me and good for the rest of us			0
' defiant : army veteran @entity3 ( far right ) said in his lawsuit he and fellow troops ' embraced ' the word ' infidel ' after insurgents constantly used the term as an insult @entity3 said he applied for the plate on the secretary of state website late last year			1

' ' as a way to cope , we decided to take this word — meant to hurt and demean us — as our own , ' @entity3 said in a statement distributed by the @entity35			2
' it ’s a point of pride and patriotism that many of us identify with , just as we would identify with the word ‘ soldier			0
