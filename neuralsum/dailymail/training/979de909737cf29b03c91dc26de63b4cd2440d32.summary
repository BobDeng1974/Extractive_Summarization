standing on the bridge of the mighty @entity2 , it is the sheer scale of the largest warship in @entity5 history that hits you			1
this hi - tech batcave commands a view that runs for miles from @entity10 , @entity11 , beyond the seemingly endless flight deck of our newest aircraft carrier and taking in the @entity15 and a hazy @entity17 city centre to the east to the @entity20 refinery and the @entity21 in the west			1
and yet , given that this is @entity24 ’s biggest engineering project , one has to fight hard not to laugh out loud at the comical size of the ship ’s tiny steering wheel			1
it is the only small thing about the first of the two new @entity44 class carriers to come on stream			0
far below the bridge , a veritable army of workers in overalls and hard hats scurry purposefully around this slumbering giant like ants , moving scaffolding , planks , screws , nails , piping and cabling			0
in a project fraught with delay and political wrangling , billions of taxpayers ’ pounds , 80,000 tons of steel , 3.4million yards of cabling and 90,000 pipe spools have been used as proof that , for the time being at least , @entity24 can still do shipbuilding			1
small wonder : one has to fight hard not to laugh out loud at the comical size of the ship 's tiny steering wheel			2
the carrier will finally take to the water next month after her royal namesake travels north for her naming ceremony			1
by the end of the decade , she should be fully operational and equipped with 36 @entity81 fighter - bombers			2
but , just 16 days before the @entity82 arrives to break a bottle of champagne against her bulbous bow , a tour of the @entity10 yard reveals a clattering , yammering wall of noise as 1,400 on - site workers weld , fit and hammer around the clock to get the new flagship ready in time			1
from the very first glimpse of her , rising up from a high security dry dock at @entity10 like some monstrous @entity99 creation from a @entity101 blockbuster , everything about her feels vast			0
making waves : the carrier 's bulbous bow shape helps the ship to cut through the water from the keel to the masthead , she stands as tall as @entity110			1
a phalanx of painters are in the process of applying seven coats of battleship grey paint over an area the size of @entity118			0
the flight deck measures 306 yards long by 76 yards wide – three times the size of its predecessor @entity123 and as big as four full - size football pitches			2
this four - acre flatland is punctuated only by the ‘ ski - jump ’ take - off ramp and two 650 - ton towers , or ‘ islands ’ ( forward for the ship ’s command - and - control , aft for air - traffic control )			1
standing on the deck yesterday on a sunny june day , the heat was already quite unbearable			0
it made one wonder what serving on operations in the sweltering @entity138 might feel like			0
queen - size : size of the new queen elizabeth class aircraft carrier if it was on the @entity143 one deck down , the heat subsided slightly in the gigantic hangar space , which will be home to an assortment of aircraft , with @entity150 eventually parked up next to @entity152 helicopters , with capacity for @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
aircraft can transfer to the flight deck via a huge lifting platform within 60 seconds			0
missiles and bombs will be supplied directly to the flight deck from the reinforced armoury by 26 robotic ‘ moles ’			0
the ship is the first of the new breed of qe - class carriers and was originally intended to enter service in 2017 , with a sister vessel , the @entity171 , joining her by 2020			2
nearly finished : construction continues on the @entity2 aircraft carrier being built in @entity10 the price of the carriers has soared to £ 5.3billion – nearly £ 2billion over-budget – and next year ’s @entity177 will decide whether we keep both or sell the @entity171 to recoup some of the costs			1
six @entity24 yards , including @entity182 on the @entity183 , have fabricated parts of the vessel , with each piece slotted into place at @entity10			2
some staff have stayed with the build even after their sections were delivered			0
@entity191 , a foreman at @entity182 , said : ‘ i have been commuting to @entity10 from @entity192 for three years now and will be staying until the end			0
‘ it will be quite emotional when she finally goes out to sea			0
it ’s been a lot of my life and it makes me very proud to be @entity24			2

@entity2 is @entity24 's biggest engineering project
two 33 - ton propellers are twice the height of a double decker bus
the carrier will finally take to the water next month when the @entity82 visits
