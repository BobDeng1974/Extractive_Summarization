the controversy enveloping the @entity2 department 's health care division is actually a net positive for the country , says retired neurosurgeon and conservative commentator @entity5 , because it has shown @entity7 the pitfalls of a government run healthcare system			1
' i think what ’s happening with the veterans is a gift from @entity14 to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider , ' @entity5 told @entity23 on saturday after an anchor asked him if the @entity26 drama is a ' preview ' of what is going to happen with @entity29 when it is fully implemented			1
' and if we ca n’t get it right , with the relatively small number of veterans , ' @entity5 continued , ' how in the world with are you going to do it with the entire population ? you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out			1
' ' i think what ¿ s happening with the veterans is a gift from @entity14 to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider , ' dr. @entity5 told @entity23 on saturday after an anchor asked him if the @entity26 drama is a ' preview ' of what is going to happen with @entity29 when it is fully implemented dr. @entity5 was catapulted to prominence after his keynote at the @entity56 in 2013			1
during his speech , @entity5 , who is black , expressed criticism for a wide range of @entity61 administration policies , including the health care reform law , to president @entity61 's face			1
' here ’s my solution : when a person is born , give them a birth certificate , an electronic medical record , and a health savings account , to which money can be contributed pre-tax to the time you ’re born to the time you die , ' @entity5 proposed			1
' when you die , you can pass it on to your family members so that when you ’re 85 years old and you have six diseases , you ’re not trying to spend up everything			0
you ’re happy to send it on and there ’s nobody talking about death panels			0
' @entity5 's fiery profession of support for values consistent with conservatism immediately caught the attention of right - wing groups , and by the following day pundits and grassroots advocates were calling on @entity5 to run for president in 2016			1
' if the @entity94 grabbed me by the collar and made me do it , i would , ' @entity5 told @entity23 host @entity97 the day after the breakfast			2
@entity5 is now a contributor to @entity23 and conservative newspaper the @entity100 and has only grown more vocal about his opposition to @entity29			1
' you know @entity29 is really i think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery , ' he told the very conservative attendees of the @entity108 's @entity107 in october			1
' and it is in a way , it is slavery in a way , because it is making all of us subservient to the government , and it was never about health care			1
it was about control , ' he said			0
dr. @entity5 , pictured here at the @entity118 in 2013 , is a potential 2016 presidential candidate			1
@entity5 said this week he 's ' starting to feel ' a calling to run on friday , @entity5 laid into the @entity26 as ' a top heavy organization with a lot of bureaucracy that keeps things from happening			1
' ' we simply do n’t need that kind of bureaucracy in virtually anything that we ’re doing today , ' @entity5 told a @entity130 @entity129 radio host			1
' we ’re problem solvers - or at least we used to be very innovative people			0
that ’s being depressed by the kinds of policies that we ’ve put in place now			2
we need to unleash the potential of the @entity7 people			0
' @entity5 , who chagrins at being labeled as a follower of any political ideology , chastised @entity140 and @entity141 on saturday for playing politics with the health care of the nation 's veterans			1
' we need seriousness here rather than just political speak			0
‘ how can i look better ? how can my party look better ? ’ @entity5 said			2
' let 's stop , and think about the people			0
' ' you know , you guys are servants			0
you 're not rulers , ' he added			0
' so first of all get that out of your mind , and think about what can we do with the problems we have to solve in this nation , which are substantial , some of which threaten to actually destroy or our nation - our fiscal irresponsibility			0
we can deal with these things			0
' @entity5 said this week he 's ' starting to feel ' a calling to seek office because so people have asked him ' to do something			1
' ' i think i ’m starting to hear something , ' he told @entity174			0
' it ’s not something i want to do after a very arduous career in neurosurgery ; i was looking for some relaxation in my life , ' @entity5 told @entity130			2
' i do n’t know if it ’s so much me that they want as they want some common sense			0
preferably somebody would come along who offered all those things , who engendered a lot of excitement and then i could get behind them and push them , ' he said			0
' but if it does n’t happen than certainly , i would have to consider it , ' he added			0
@entity5 would be well - funded if he does decide to run			2
in the first three months of 2014 alone , the @entity196 @entity195 raised close to $ 2.4 million			0
by comparsion , the @entity198 political action committee raised significantly less money than @entity5 's fans did			2
the @entity196 @entity195 has already spent all of the money it raised , but its ability to elicit so much money in donations on @entity5 's behalf a year and a half out from a figurative presidential campaign is impressive			2
say the magic words , and dr. @entity5 could go from dark horse presidential candidate to serious competitior overnight .			2

@entity5 is a former neurosurgeon who is considering running for president in 2016
@entity5 was asked this weekend if the @entity2 health care mess is a ' preview ' of what 's to come with @entity29
' i think what ’s happening with the veterans is a gift from @entity14 to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider , ' @entity5 responded
