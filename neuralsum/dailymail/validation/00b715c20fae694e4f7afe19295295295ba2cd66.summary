the @entity0 has once again called upon the club 's owners to abandon plans to change the club name to @entity5			1
the @entity6 rejected owner @entity8 's attempt to rebrand last year but on monday an arbitration tribunal ruled that that decision had been put aside			1
that was due to the involvement of @entity14 chairman @entity13 on the sub-committee which made the initial decision , with the tribunal believing @entity13 based his decision only on what members of the @entity20 we die supporters group , now part of @entity0 , wanted - the club 's now 111 - year - old name to remain unchanged			1
the @entity0 has called upon club owner @entity8 to abandon his name change plans that means that while the club will remain as @entity5 until the end of the current campaign , @entity8 can now re-apply to change the name again ahead of the new season			1
but @entity0 has pleaded with the club 's hierarchy to completely abandon their lengthy campaign , believing the tribunal 's decision was based on a ' very minor technicality '			1
' @entity0 urges the owners to abandon the name change application once and for all , ' read a statement			2
' it is clear from the evidence set out in the arbitration document that a strong and compelling case for change does not exist			0
@entity5 supporters have publicly stated their opposition to the name change and do n't want the ' @entity20 ' dropped ' the @entity6 has published a 30 - page arbitration document that describes why the @entity6 's decision to reject the club 's proposed name change has been ' set aside ' on a very minor technicality , having rejected most of the arguments offered by the club			1
' @entity57 is disappointed with this finding - the @entity6 made a sound decision made in the interests of football in general , not just those of @entity20 supporters			2
' the statement continued : ' the arbitration document also reveals that the club agreed to present a business case for the change and then failed to do so			2
we believe this is because there is not and has never been any evidence that ' @entity5 ' would generate a financial benefit			0
' the report also stated that the heavily - weighted ballot of season ticket holders the club ran was ' poor ' , ' unimpressive ' and the outcome was ' unconvincing '			0
' fans hold ' @entity20 till we die ' scarves above their heads during a @entity83 game last season @entity8 , however , is regarding the decision of the panel as a major victory and does not believe he even has to submit a new application to change the name			1
' the tribunal states , in this case the @entity6 saying no to @entity5 , that the decision should be set aside , ' he told the @entity93 on wednesday			2
' that means nothing has happened			0
' the application has not been answered			0
the tribunal says our appeal was successful			0
that decision to set it aside was unanimous			0
' a @entity5 sign is displayed at the @entity102 , and is @entity8 gets his way it will be ' city ' no more the @entity106 businessman also reiterated that the club will remain for sale until he gets his name - change plans pushed through			1
' the club is up for sale as i 've said before , ' he added			0
' there is no change			0
if i can change the club 's name to @entity5 then i will stay and develop the club further and further			1
i have shown it would be a success			0
' if it is not @entity5 then the club will be sold			2
what is the problem with that ? i could have sold the club already , but i want it to go to a good home			0
' on the pitch , @entity5 are fighting a relegation battle while the boardroom battles centre around the club 's name			1
