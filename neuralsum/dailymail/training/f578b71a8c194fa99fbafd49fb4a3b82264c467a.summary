with two goals in five second - half minutes against @entity2 in midweek , @entity0 has taken over @entity4 ’s mantle as the most deadly @entity5 currently residing at @entity6			1
however , the fit - again defender has his sights set on emulating another well - known compatriot			2
as a youngster , @entity0 grew up in @entity11 in northern @entity5 watching @entity13 matches which featured his idol — a certain @entity14 — putting @entity15 to the sword			1
after moving to @entity6 in january 2012 , however , circumstances have dictated he ’s had to wait over three frustrating years for his first chance to face the @entity20 side			1
after making his first appearance in a @entity25 jersey since @entity26 on november 9 , the 28 - year - old — who came on at half - time on wednesday — insists he is more than ready for next weekend ’s @entity27 semi-final			1
it is , as he knows from his formative years watching on television , an occasion where heroes can emerge			1
@entity0 has had to wait over three years to get his first shot at an @entity13 ‘ when i was younger , i watched @entity35 league games on television , especially the @entity13 games because of @entity14 and @entity38 , ’ recalled @entity0			1
‘ so i ’ve seen them and , of course , it ’s a good time to be a hero			2
‘ i ’ve been here three years now and not played in one			1
but i always knew i wanted to be at @entity25 for a long time , so i knew i would play them at some point			1
i am ready for it ! ‘ i ’ve been to a couple of the games			2
i sat in the stands at @entity20 and at @entity6			2
i was injured for the home game and i was in the squad at @entity20 ( but did n’t make the bench )			2
‘ the occasion was still unlike anything i had experienced			2
we ’ve not had it for a while			2
’ @entity14 celebrates after scoring against @entity15 in a @entity60 tie in 2004 @entity0 insists everyone within the @entity25 dressing room is aware of the significance and importance of the upcoming @entity27 and @entity66 ties against historic foes @entity15 and @entity68 respectively			1
but he believes the uninitiated — like @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 — wo n’t truly understand the occasion until they walk into the searing white heat of @entity75 for the semi-final a week tomorrow			2
‘ we play for @entity25 and everyone here knows how important these games are , ’ said @entity0 , whose side faces @entity78 in @entity79 in a lunchtime @entity80 kick - off today			1
‘ i do n’t go out much			2
after training i go back to my house and spend time with my kids but still i know how important these games are for the fans			0
‘ but it ’s hard to tell someone about these kind of games if they have not experienced it yet			0
‘ i always remember hearing that the @entity98 nights at @entity6 were unbelievable			0
but then when you actually experience it , i remember being like “ woah ! ”			0
@entity0 wants to emulate his idol @entity14 by scoring against @entity25 's fierce rivals @entity15 ‘ i think you need to experience it for yourself			1
if you love football you should be watching an @entity13 match			1
‘ when we drew them ( @entity15 ) we were all talking about it			1
i ’m not going to lie			0
of course it is a big game			0
but it ’s tight in the league just now and that means we ca n’t just focus on the cup and the @entity116 matches like we did the last two years			1
‘ before we could put the league on the side a little bit			0
but now we need to be focusing on every game and that has been quite good for us , i think			0
‘ we play @entity78 today and as well as needing the three points it ’s a chance for players to play their way into the @entity15 match			1
’ @entity0 ’s two second - half goals were headers but he was left ruing ‘ blowing ’ his big chance to grab a hat - trick in the 4 - 0 rout of @entity2			1
he does not expect to be adding to his tally in @entity79 today or rivalling @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity4 at the end of the season			0
@entity25 take on @entity15 next weekend in a @entity27 semi-final showdown ‘ they were my first goals in years so i ’d be quite stupid to start boasting about it , ’ he smiled			1
‘ of course , it ’s not every day you score two goals			0
and one of them was probably the best goal i have ever scored with my head			0
but maybe not my best - ever goal , because i got some decent ones at @entity150			0
‘ but , let ’s be honest , i do n’t think i ’ll be up there at the end of the season			0
‘ i actually had a chance to get a perfect hat - trick			0
it was a once in a lifetime opportunity			0
but i blew it ! i have maybe scored a hat - trick when i was really young			0
i used to play up front when i was a boy but never in senior football			1
‘ is there a goal of the season competition developing between our full - backs ? absolutely , although i do n’t think @entity165 ( @entity166 ) is in the competition yet			0
but @entity169 ’ against @entity170 was really good , a screamer			0
‘ it ’s good playing in this @entity25 team because that ’s three games in a row now the full - backs have scored goals			1
i do n’t think we are going to score in every game			0
but it is always nice to feel like you have the opportunity to go forward			0

@entity0 has had to wait over three years to play an @entity13
@entity25 take on fierce rivals @entity15 next weekend in @entity27
