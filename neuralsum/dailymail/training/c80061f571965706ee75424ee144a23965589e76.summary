the pretty old @entity1 cloth town of @entity2 is linked by a canal to the @entity4 , from which for centuries @entity6 wool was shipped inland for weaving			1
on thursday , it will provide the setting for an @entity13 summit which could mark the beginning of a process whereby , within a few short years , @entity16 could feel obliged to quit @entity17			1
if @entity20 is anointed president of the @entity22 , many voters in this country will start eyeing the exit			1
the @entity25 and @entity24 in @entity2 , @entity1 , pictured in 1916 , was reduced to rubble during the @entity27 the @entity28 have been restored to their former glory in @entity2 , @entity1 , a hundred years after they were destroyed			1
in the same town this week , the @entity13 is planning to hand its top job to an arch - federalist yet a century ago , around this same @entity2 , millions of @entity16 soldiers fought to frustrate @entity35 dominance of @entity17 , and almost a quarter of a million died , including one of my own great - uncles			1
it is a place etched deep into the heritage of @entity16 , a name that commands pride — because there the @entity43 defied repeated @entity35 offensives — and also horror , because of the cost			1
one of my grandfathers and another of my great - uncles won military crosses there , and most families in @entity16 can claim similar associations			1
@entity54 was a poet , a post-war friend of @entity55			0
in 1930 , he wrote a piece entitled @entity57 , about @entity2 in 1917 , of which one verse ran : when every hollow ’s a belching mass of wrangling guns , guns bellowing to guns you can not tell a burst of ours from the @entity67 ’ suddenly through the cordite , i smelt the gas			2
@entity71 went the warning through the roar and screech the spitting splinters ploughed us like a squall half - blinded gunners wrestled with the breech			0
what would @entity54 and the legion of his long - ago comrades have thought , i wonder , to see @entity2 today , rebuilt from knee - high rubble into manicured prosperity , the scene of a summit of nations overwhelmingly dominated by mighty @entity35 ? they would surely welcome @entity90 ’s country as an impeccable democracy , which has forsworn militarism to become one of the greatest manufacturers on @entity95			1
but they would wonder at the extraordinary reversal of history , whereby ‘ wipers ’ threatens to go down in history as the place where the @entity16 commitment to the @entity102 — which began in 1914 — faces its nemesis			1
@entity16 for most of its past sought to influence @entity17 at long range , without direct engagement on foreign soil			2
for most of the @entity110 , we fought the @entity111 mainly with our fleets and our gold , and only reluctantly committed an @entity43 to the continent			0
the @entity13 may give its top job to to @entity20 , pictured after @entity117 secured his triumph over @entity120 on june 18 , 1815 , at @entity121 — barely an hour ’s drive from @entity2 — our soldiers went thankfully home			1
no @entity16 government wished to contemplate fighting again in @entity17			2
thus , a hundred years later , the @entity43 , which had meanwhile fought @entity126 and dervishes and @entity128 and @entity129 on far - flung fields , was bemused to find itself back in @entity1			1
a grenadier officer wrote after leading his men through @entity2 for the first time in october 1914 : ‘ it seems so odd to be fighting in this sort of country — we have always associated war with the tropics			2
’ but fight furiously he and 150,000 of his comrades did , through october and november , to defeat the last huge @entity35 offensive , designed to win the war by @entity143			2
yet the price of victory was so high that no one felt minded to celebrate			0
most of the @entity149 , the old sweats of the @entity148 , repose for ever in cemeteries around @entity2			2
during the four years that followed , an average of 5,000 @entity16 soldiers a month perished in the @entity57 , where they fought three more major battles that bear its name			2
in addition to the dead , a million @entity16 men were wounded there			0
one of the most familiar sights of my childhood was that of some of them , wearing medals but with empty sleeves or trouser legs , playing chirpily melancholy music in city streets			0
many of those who had bled , or seen loved ones perish in @entity27 , felt deeply bitter when it proved necessary for their successor generation to do it all over again , to fill thousands more cemeteries , to defeat @entity35 a second time between 1939 and 1945			1
after we had won all over again , it seemed that the only way forward for tired , broke , battered @entity16 was to throw in its lot with the continent			0
in pursuit of peace , we kept an @entity43 on the @entity186 for more than half a century , to play our part in deterring @entity128 aggression through the @entity189			0
in pursuit of prosperity , in 1973 we joined the @entity192 , a free trading association which , for a time , seemed to serve us well			0
but @entity17 ’s tragedy — and i use the word advisedly — is that its political elites have never been content with the notion of the @entity13 as a medium of mercantile exchange			0
they have pursued with dogged determination a vision of political and economic union which defies popular will , cultural identities , democratic principles and the merest common sense			0
i say all this without pleasure , because i have never voted for @entity212 and never will			0
if it is humanly possible , i want us to stay in @entity17 — but not at any price			0
if our partners , and especially the members of the @entity217 , are bent on advancing towards ever - closer union , then not only are the @entity16 people almost certain to reject such a course , but they seem entirely right to do so			2
the @entity13 leaders ’ apparent determination to choose as their president the @entity224 @entity20 , who is as notorious for fanatical federalism as for his unfitness to achieve much after liquid lunches , seems a sign no @entity16 citizen can fail to heed			1
we often hear how eager the @entity35 are to keep @entity16 in @entity17 , to offer concessions to our desire for a repatriation of powers			1
but @entity90 ’s support for @entity20 ’s appointment makes plain the emptiness of such expressions of goodwill			2
i have attended several @entity17 conferences , at which the obsessive commitment of the @entity35 political elite to pursue union , regardless of their own electorate ’s opinions , has been wretchedly apparent			0
a pitch by @entity246 , pictured talking with @entity20 , for a renegotiation of our @entity13 membership if he wins next year ¿ s general election ' seems likely to get nowhere meaningful ' @entity246 ’s pitch for a renegotiation of our @entity13 membership if he wins next year ’s general election seems likely to get nowhere @entity253 or later , the @entity217 will probably crash - land , with especially painful consequences for its southern @entity17 members , however many of their bills the @entity35 go on paying in order to enable them all to buy imported bmws			1
@entity111 ’s future looks politically bleak and economically sterile			0
even in the cause of we @entity16 being good @entity17 — of the kind i have wanted to be for most of my adult life — it seems impossible to stay aboard a vessel committed to a doomed voyage			0
i do not think our departure from @entity17 will bring sudden happiness to @entity16 , but thursday ’s meeting at @entity2 seems almost certain to start us on that path , through no fault of mr @entity246			1
what a place to choose , to make decisions that presage the undoing of so many of our hopes for @entity16 in @entity17			1
my ancestors , and probably yours , too , would look upon the triumph of @entity20 with disbelief that the @entity35 could prove themselves so stupid as to want this foolish man , and @entity16 so small a place as to be unable to stop him			1
on thursday , the buglers who play the @entity287 at the @entity288 in @entity2 may bid a symbolic farewell to more than the dead of a century ago			0
the saga of @entity16 ’s role in @entity17 , which began in blood a century ago , threatens to end in torrid farce .			0

the @entity13 is planning to make @entity20 president of the @entity22
appointment of ' arch - federalist ' *due* to take place in @entity2 in @entity1
thousands of @entity16 died *nearby* during @entity27 battling @entity35
