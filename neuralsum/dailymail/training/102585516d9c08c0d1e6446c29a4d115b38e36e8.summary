the @entity0 could be broken up on the basis of @entity3 voters rushing to back independence , 15 years after @entity5 set the country on the road to devolution			1
the former prime minister has been conspicuous by his absence from the referendum campaign trail , despite being born in @entity12			1
but senior @entity13 blame him for failing to predict the rise of nationalism , and say the battle to save the @entity17 will be won or lost in what used to be rock solid @entity3 areas			2
mr @entity5 supported devolution , which was overwhelmingly backed by @entity36 in a referendum			1
the @entity42 then opened in 1999 , to the obvious delight of mr @entity39 who said it was a major step on the road to total separation			2
in the 2011 elections to the @entity42 , the @entity25 secured a surprise overall majority , with mr @entity39 declaring he had a mandate for a referendum on independence which could not be ignored by @entity52			1
mr @entity5 has avoided campaigning for a no vote as he knows he remains a divisive character north of the border in the wake of the @entity58			1
leader : @entity39 rose to power in @entity36 when mr @entity5 was serving as prime minister close : a new @entity63 poll shows the no campaign just four points ahead of @entity31 debate : graffiti has appeared on the walls of buildings in @entity36 arguing for a @entity31 vote in his autobiography , the former @entity3 leader claimed he was to blame for the party 's humiliating defeat by the @entity25 in 2007 , and the @entity75 have repeatedly described him as ' toxic '			1
but many of those now battling to save the 307 - year - old @entity17 in the final hours of the campaign say mr @entity5 must shoulder the blame			2
former conservative prime minister sir @entity80 has blamed @entity3 for the growing threat of @entity36 independence – claiming the party had spent years attacking the conservatives and @entity52			1
sir @entity80 said @entity3 and the @entity25 ‘ have fed a divisive narrative that has bitten deep , ignoring the revolution in @entity36 living standards brought about , in large part , by conservative policies ’			1
he added in an article in @entity92 last week : ‘ it would be ironic indeed if @entity36 voted for separation , and @entity3 lost all its significant representation in the @entity96			2
if this comes to pass , no one should weep for them			0
’ creation : the @entity42 , pictured , was supported by @entity5 when it was found in 1999 celebration : mr @entity5 with @entity101 , the first @entity36 first minister , after the referendum on @entity36 devolution in september 1997 a new @entity105 opinion poll for the @entity63 shows that the race is still too close to call			1
the headline results show that 44.1 per cent of @entity36 plan to back independence , up from 42.4 per cent in a comparable poll from last week			2
support for a no vote remains virtually static at 47.7 per cent , with 8.3 per cent undecided			0
overall , this points to a final result of 52 per cent @entity114 and 48 per cent @entity31			0
but alarmingly for the no camp , the poll indicates a shift back to @entity31 among @entity3 voters , who may decide the outcome			1
while 91 per cent of those who voted @entity120 in the 2011 @entity42 elections are backing no , just 60 per cent of @entity3 voters plan to do the same			1
@entity3 ’s big beasts like @entity123 and @entity124 have been deployed to try to win back their supporters to the no cause			2
but mr @entity5 ’s only recent intervention has been during a speech in @entity129			0
he said : ' obviously i hope that @entity36 votes to stay part of the @entity0			0
' contrast : @entity123 and @entity124 are pictured on the campaign trail ahead of the referendum speaking at a security conference in the @entity129 capital of @entity137 at the weekend , he added : ' to rip up the alliance between our countries would not be sensible , politically , economically or even emotionally			1
' born in @entity12 , mr @entity5 went to school in @entity142 before returning to @entity36 to attend @entity12 's @entity143			1
his father was born in @entity145 but grew up in @entity146			0
in his final speech to a @entity36 @entity3 conference in @entity149 in 2006 , he famously said : ' i detest this narrow nationalism not because it engenders fear but because it squanders hope			0
' ex-chancellor @entity154 , leader of @entity155 , has previously called for his former boss to play his part in a ' call to arms ' to keep the @entity0 together			0
but mr @entity5 has been reluctant to speak out , in stark contrast with his successor , @entity123 , who has returned to frontline politics to fight for the @entity17			0
@entity162 insists there is little @entity164 can do to persuade more people to the no cause			0
’ there is a massive @entity3 effort on the ground , ’ said a source			0
’ we are leaving the field open to @entity3			0
almost all @entity13 are voting no. there is literally nothing more we can do			0
’ @entity3 have got to swamp the area			0

@entity5 was born in @entity12 but has not campaigned on referendum
he supported devolution as prime minister and set up @entity42
the @entity25 's election *victory* in 2011 paved the way for independence vote
but @entity5 is considered too toxic to be *invited* on the campaign trail
only 60 *%* of @entity3 voters say they plan to vote no in *tomorrow* 's poll
