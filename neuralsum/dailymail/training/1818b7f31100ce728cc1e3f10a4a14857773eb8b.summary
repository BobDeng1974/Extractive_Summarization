one might be forgiven for thinking these incredible pictures are photographs , but they are in fact the work of a @entity7 artist who paints street scenes that look like the real thing			0
@entity11 has only been painting for three years , but in that time he has managed to create these intricate pieces of artwork of life in his home town of @entity16 in the @entity17			1
and in print , or even in front of your eyes , it is difficult to spot the difference between the paintings and what might be a photograph			1
now his paintings are being snapped up by art collectors for four - figure sums - almost before the paint is dry on the canvas - after he was shortlisted for this year 's @entity43			1
the artist says he only turned his hand to painting after his dog , a cross-collie called tubs , fell ill in 2011 and he spent hours at home nursing him			2
he said : ' i was always good at art at school but when i left at 15 it was n't something i looked to pursue directly			0
instead , i became involved in making signs			0
his style of work is known as contemporary realism and originates from a line drawing of a photograph and then is painstakingly painted			2
this painting is of the @entity61 in @entity16 , where @entity11 chooses to recreate familiar images of his hometown @entity64 , another incredibly realistic painting of a @entity16 high street by @entity11 , which was shortlisted for the @entity43 this year ' i never yearned to be able to paint in the intervening years and i do n't think i 'd have been ready to do the art i 'm now doing 20 years ago			1
' the first painting that mr @entity11 tackled was of former cotton mill , @entity71 in @entity16 - a building with which he is very familiar with - choosing to specifically feature the fire escape			1
he said : ' i capture the scene i intend to paint by taking a photograph initially			0
but then it is down to me to adjust the scene as i see fit			0
' for example , the @entity80 entry is of @entity82 in @entity16 but people looking at it will realise the street is narrower than it would be in reality			2
' and in crossing the tracks , which is a view looking across @entity16 's railway station , the angles are altered			2
' the temporary bridge should be at more of a 90 - degree angle but i wanted to use it to lead the eye along and into the painting more , so i reduced the angle			2
' his paintings are now being snapped up by collectors willing to pay four - figure sums for the pieces			1
pictured : the things we leave behind acrylic painting there has to be more than this , has already sold to a private collector in @entity34 after he was shortlisted for a national award to create his pieces , mr @entity11 painstakingly creates a line drawing of the scene he will eventually paint			1
he takes up his brush and paints in every detail , including shadows , puddles and reflections - and each one takes about 250 hours			0
he said : ' a couple of things happened after i finished the first painting			0
i had it accepted for exhibition at @entity125 and also entered the @entity127 competition , where i was commended			0
' @entity128 , at @entity125 , was keen to put my first five paintings on display and within 10 months they had sold for prices ranging from £ 1,200 to £ 1,800 , which absolutely amazed me			0
' @entity11 , who is completely self - taught , only took up painting three years ago after his dog , tubs , fell ill in 2011 and he had time at home			1

@entity11 , 44 , has created these intricate and realistic paintings of his home town of @entity16 in the @entity17
the artwork looks more like a photograph and they are now being snapped up for four - figure sums by collectors
mr @entity11 , who was shortlisted for @entity43 2014 , has only been painting for three years and is self - taught
