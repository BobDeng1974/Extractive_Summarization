@entity8 is one of just 60 children in the @entity10 living with @entity11 , or @entity11 , an incurable condition that causes increasingly severe disability and premature death			1
but her mother , @entity15 , is determined to make her daughter 's short life as full as possible and give her some unforgettable experiences			1
' like a bomb went off ' : @entity20 was devastated to learn that her daughter @entity21 had a terminal illness , but has since pledged to show the three - year - old the @entity5 to make her life as full as possible most a-t sufferers are healthy for around two years , but their balance and co-ordination then begin to deteriorate rapidly			1
tragically , many will be forced to use a wheelchair by the age of 10 and will need full - time care			2
the condition also affects the immune system , leading to frequent chest and lung infections and a high risk of leukaemia and other cancers			1
with no current cure , children with @entity38 rarely live beyond their early 20s			2
@entity15 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , who also has a 12 - year - old son @entity43 , wants to raise awareness of @entity11 and find a search for a cure after @entity21 's diagnosis in may			1
hoping for a miracle : @entity21 has a genetic condition called @entity11 , which causes increasingly severe disability and premature death she said : ' @entity21 was about one - and - a - half when mother 's intuition told me something was n't right			1
she was clumsy and kept falling into things			2
' when i was finally told she had a-t i was devastated			2
i think i 'm still in denial			2
it 's like waiting for a time bomb to go off , waiting for the symptoms to start appearing			2
' i could wake up one day and she could have pneumonia and die - it 's like @entity65 roulette			2
' something will get her but i do n't know what it will be			2
' i 'm carrying on from day to day like everything is normal , because it is			0
i 'm just waiting for the day it changes			0
' every day i wake up and look at her and think it 's not happening because there are n't really any visual signs yet			0
' but i 'm a realist and very pragmatic about the things she will and wo n't be able to do as she gets older , unless a miracle happens			0
' ' @entity81 thing of all ' : @entity15 says her daughter loves her dolls and is ' really maternal ' , but the mother - of - two is heartbroken at the thought @entity21 wo n't be able to have children of her own she added : ' i want to be able to take her to @entity88 and do all the lovely family things with her and @entity43 whilst she can still enjoy them			1
' it 's my dream to take her to see the seven wonders of the world			0
' the ' new ' seven wonders of the world are the @entity95 , the @entity96 , the @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99 in @entity100 , @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 in @entity104 and @entity105 in @entity106			0
mum - of - two @entity15 believes that by raising money for the @entity109 and awareness for others , it is helping her to cope with @entity21 's diagnosis			1
she said : ' i 'm getting heavily into the charity side of things and i think that 's my way of coping			0
' i want to help the @entity109 raise enough money to research and find a cure for the condition within @entity21 's lifetime			1
' it helps give me hope for the future - the only bit of hope i have			1
' i feel like it 's my purpose in life to raise awareness of the condition , like i was put here specifically to be @entity21 's mum			1
' it 's going to be a rollercoaster but i 'm ready for it			0
' our lives are not going to be ruled by @entity21 's condition - i need to keep life as normal and enjoyable as possible for as long as possible for the sake of both my children			1
' people ask me how i cope and i tell them i just have to get on with it - i 'm a mum			0
' @entity21 is so beautiful and has so much character , she really is a special soul			0
' she loves her dollies and cooking and she 's really maternal but knowing that she will never be a mother , get married or have children is one of the hardest things of all			1
' the little life she does have needs to be as special as possible , but life does n't always allow for that			1
' if i could afford to i would spend life making sure @entity21 's life was as enjoyable and enriched as possible			1
' i now realise the importance of the saying ' live everyday like it 's your last '			0
' family friend @entity158 has now pledged to raise Â£ 100,000 for @entity21 by arranging an event called the @entity160			0
the event will see 20 men and women as far away as @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 come together to embark on a mega-triathalon in aid of the @entity109 next april			0
@entity38 is caused by a defect known as ' mutation ' on a particular gene , meaning that the gene can not carry out its function properly			0
due to this the gene can not properly produce a protein called @entity177 , which should be in every cell			0
when two people carrying a single copy of the mutated gene have a child together and pass the mutated gene on , there is a one in four chance that the child will have @entity38 to donate to @entity160 for @entity21 , visit http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/lolabloomer .			0

@entity8 , 3 , has a rare genetic condition that will eventually take her life
but her mother @entity15 is determined to give her many unforgettable experiences
