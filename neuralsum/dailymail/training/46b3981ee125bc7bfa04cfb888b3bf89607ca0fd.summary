rules on @entity4 crops should be overhauled to speed up the development of the technology , @entity1 ’s chief scientist said yesterday			1
sir @entity7 claimed that the regulations , which have so far kept commercial @entity4 cultivation out of @entity1 , are not fit for purpose and need urgent changes			1
his backing for the hugely controversial technology came as a report by his committee of scientific advisers risked accusations of arrogance by saying @entity4 opponents had a ‘ neurosis ’ which ‘ boggles the mind ’			1
rules on @entity4 crops should be overhauled to speed up the development of the technology , @entity1 ¿ s chief scientist sir @entity7 has said , as he claimed that the regulations ' are not fit for purpose and need urgent changes ' sir @entity7 insisted that @entity25 rules banning the commercial cultivation of @entity4 crops had to be changed to feed the world			1
critics immediately accused the chief scientific adviser of ‘ playing a dangerous game ’ with the nation ’s safety			1
there are concerns that tampering with genes in crops to create ‘ frankenstein foods ’ – strains which are more resistant to diseases , pests or produce higher yields – could unintentionally damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health			2
dr @entity44 , director of @entity45 @entity1 , said : ‘ government advisers are playing a dangerous game with farming and our food			1
tougher , not weaker , regulation is essential			0
’ and @entity52 , of @entity53 , said : ‘ just because we can do clever things with genetics it does n’t mean that we should , and it certainly does n’t mean we should cut corners when it comes to safety			0
’ one of the authors of yesterday ’s report by the @entity63 , which advises the government , argued that the debate had been skewed by an anti-gm ‘ neurosis ’ which has slowed progress			0
sir @entity7 insisted that @entity25 rules banning the commercial cultivation of @entity4 crops had to be changed to feed the world genetic scientist @entity71 , who recently developed a blight - resistant potato , said : ‘ how anyone could think this is a bad thing boggles the mind			1
we need to better explain that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the @entity4 method			2
’ professor @entity71 likened current regulation to early cars having to go slowly behind people waving a red flag			0
‘ the regulation of the technology is not proportionate			0
it is time to remove the red flags			0
’ the report , which was produced at the request of the prime minister , recommends sweeping reform to the @entity25 ’s regulatory system , with crops licensed in this country in the same way as medical drugs			1

‘ climate disruption and population growth are increasing the pressures on food supply			0
the challenge is to get more from existing land in a sustainable way , or people will go unfed			0
’ in a letter to @entity118 , he said : ‘ we should have confidence in the scientific evidence which concludes that , when properly controlled , @entity4 products are as safe as their conventional counterparts			2
‘ the longer the @entity25 continues to oppose @entity4 , while the rest of the world adopt it , the greater the risk that @entity25 agriculture will become uncompetitive , especially as more @entity4 crops are commercialised successfully elsewhere			1
’ all food containing @entity4 ingredients , such as flour or oils , have to be labelled , but meat , milk and eggs from animals fed on @entity4 products do not			2
