the @entity2 @entity1 official in charge of the agency 's sprawling health care system resigned abruptly on friday , just a day after telling a @entity7 committee that he knew in 2010 about a memo describing ' inappropriate scheduling practices ' now blamed for as many as 40 deaths at @entity12 medical centers			1
complaints about long wait lists and falsified patient appointment reports have dogged @entity12 hospitals and clinics nationwide			2
dr. @entity18 , a 40 - year veteran of the @entity12 system and its undersecretary for health , tendered his resignation even though he was already scheduled to retire later in the year			1
the @entity23 announced his successor on may 1 but said @entity18 would remain in his job until @entity26 , director of the @entity12 's @entity28 - based @entity27 , wins @entity7 confirmation			1

' on thursday , both @entity44 and @entity18 men testified in a @entity78 hearing			2
@entity44 said then that he was ' mad as hell ' about the growing scandal but would n't terminate any underlings until an inspector general report was completed			1
that report 's conclusions are expected in early june			0
@entity18 acknowledged to lawmakers that he had seen a 2010 memo titled ' @entity87 , ' which described failures in several of the @entity12 's 21 service regions			2
@entity44 , seated next to him , insisted that ' i was not , i am not ' aware of it			0
recent revelations blame shoddy management for the deaths of dozens of former soldiers , airmen , sailors and @entity98 , as administrators in @entity100 – and possibly elsewhere – maintained a secret off - the - books waiting list for veterans in need of critical care			1
official lists were kept short so the agency could appear to be doing its job despite some waits being more than a year long			0
in one case , a @entity100 official was awarded bonuses based on fraudulent statistics as veterans died waiting for medical care			1
' we have been working continuously to try and identify where those sites are and what we need to do to prevent that from happening			0
it 's absolutely inexcusable , ' @entity18 told lawmakers thursday			2

' we have more than allegations at this point , ' @entity143 said thursday			0
' we have evidence , solid evidence , of wrongdoing within the @entity12 system , and it is more than an isolated instance of wrongdoing – it ’s a pattern and practice			0
' @entity44 would say only that he would ' make that [ option ] available to the @entity12 inspector general ' if that ’s his request			1
' @entity1 secretary @entity44 's future is a delicate subject : he 's a decorated veteran , twice wounded in the @entity164 , a former army chief of staff , and a @entity166 - @entity2 who retired as a four - star general in addition to the @entity100 scandal , @entity12 offices have reportedly destroyed more than 1.5 million medical orders in recent years without confirming that patients received the treatment they were supposed to get			1
similar reporting has shown that backlogs of medical appointments in @entity177 and @entity12 facilities were wiped off the books to make appointment backlogs appear far shorter than they were			0

key to the @entity57 administration 's defense of its leading veteran advocate is the ongoing inspector general investigation			2
but members of @entity190 are still smelling blood and want @entity44 to resign next			0
@entity193 ’ affairs chairman @entity192 , a @entity194 @entity47 , said in a statement friday that ' @entity18 's " resignation " is the pinnacle of disingenuous political doublespeak			2
@entity18 was already scheduled to retire in 2014 and president @entity57 has already announced his intention to nominate @entity18 ’s replacement , so characterizing this as a " resignation " just does n’t pass the smell test			2
