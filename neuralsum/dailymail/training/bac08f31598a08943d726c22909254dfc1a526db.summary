christian schools in @entity1 are under investigation by the @entity3 for allegedly ' discriminating ' against non-religious teachers			1
the probe could ultimately force schools with a @entity9 ethos to stop giving preference to religious staff when recruiting , it is understood			1
the schools will be scrutinised to see if expressing a preference for religious teachers – and having the right to pay them more than non-believing colleagues – breaches equality laws			2
@entity19 rules state that a school must be able to prove a ' genuine occupational requirement ' in order to discriminate in favour of a religious candidate			0
the @entity3 is set to investigate christian schools in @entity1 to see if they breach equality laws when expressing a preference to religious staff many schools which advertise for staff list a religion as a ' desirable feature ' in those who apply			1
however , the @entity34 , whose complaints sparked the inquiry , says describing religious adherence as ' desirable ' falls short of the @entity19 standard			1
@entity40 , campaigns officer at the @entity34 , told the @entity41 : ' if religious practice is a ' desirable ' quality and not an essential one , then it can not be a genuine occupational requirement			2
it should either be essential or not there at all			0
' other faith schools including @entity50 and @entity51 schools will also be examined			1
the case also brings into question government guidance that gives voluntary - aided faith schools , which are part - funded by religious organisations , the freedom to apply ' religious criteria when recruiting or dismissing any member of their teaching staff '			1
the schools can give preference to religious candidates in ' recruitment , remuneration and promotion ' , @entity68 guidance states			2
the @entity34 has asked the commission to investigate whether the government guidance is at odds with the @entity19 directive			2
@entity73 , director of the @entity74 , told the @entity41 that faith schools should determine ' on an individual basis ' whether they required a religious candidate for a particular role			1
he said : ' they need to look at the full circumstances of each job			0
' @entity82 of the @entity83 said : ' church schools are hugely popular with parents			0
' they are oversubscribed and they dominate performance tables			0
the church ethos is why they have high standards and why they do such a good job of preparing children for life in 21st - century @entity1			0
a complaint by the @entity34 sparked the investigation by @entity97 ' it 's disappointing that humanists seem to be so intolerant of religious organisations seeking to remain religious			1
there 's a relentless agenda to secularise religious organisations			0
if they were to succeed , it would severely damage these church schools and undermine the great work that they do			0
' a spokesman for the @entity109 , which runs 133 primary schools and 20 secondaries , said its schools usually sought a ' @entity9 commitment ' only when filling senior leadership positions			0
he added : ' however , even then , in the majority of those cases , a school will be looking more for someone who will actively support the @entity9 traditions and ethos of the school , rather than a ' card - carrying ' member of the @entity125			0
' we have senior staff in our schools who are adherents of various faiths and many who have no personal faith			2
' a spokesman for the @entity134 said the government 's guidance allowing faith schools to apply religious criteria was in line with the ' genuine occupational requirement ' rule set out in the @entity19 directive			1
a spokesman for the @entity3 confirmed it is considering the complaint and had contacted the @entity1 authorities .			1
