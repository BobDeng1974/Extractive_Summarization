@entity10 's participation in the @entity11 had been in doubt after the @entity13 said she needed to remove the head scarf for her match			1
but @entity5 @entity18 ( @entity17 ) spokesman @entity16 announced yesterday that the @entity13 had relented its stance after negotiations between officials , clearing the way for @entity10 to fight on friday			1
the decision comes as the inclusion of female athletes for the first time ever in the @entity5 @entity18 team has prompted a heated reaction among hardliners in the oil - rich @entity46 state			1
some conservative islamists have denounced @entity29 and @entity10 as shameless ' whores ' , but many other @entity5 have praised them as trailblazers for the progress of women 's rights			1
the decision to allow @entity10 , 16 , to compete dressed in @entity36 - compliant clothing threatens now to intensify that quarrel			1
she had said she would refuse to compete in the +78 - kilogram judo category if she was banned from wearing a hijab			0
@entity5 newspapers reported that she had telephoned her father to say she would withdraw from the @entity6 if she was forced to compete uncovered			1
the president of the @entity13 @entity61 , said last week that @entity10 would have to fight without a hijab to comply with ' the principle and spirit of judo '			1
the @entity13 's regulations for the @entity6 state that no headgear can be worn , and the federation had said there could be a danger to fighters if a hijab is inadvertently used for an otherwise legal strangulation grip			1
but ms @entity16 said yesterday that , after negotiation between the @entity17 , the @entity18 and the @entity77 , an agreement had now been reached on an acceptable form of headscarf			1
' they agreed on a design and she will compete wearing this design , ' ms @entity16 said , adding that she did not know how this design looked			0
game on : @entity10 will compete in the +78kg judo competition while runner @entity29 will be at the start line for the 800m at the @entity89 @entity90 in the @entity91 : competing in the @entity6 is such a huge step for women in @entity5 , they are happy to abide by the strict caveats laid out by their country 's leaders @entity99 clerics in @entity5 oppose women 's sport , arguing that it is immodest and against their nature			1
that view was reflected in @entity105 postings , including one under a hashtag that would translate as ' @entity108 '			0
' one should not hesitate to describe their participation as shameful and a great sin , ' @entity109 , whose @entity105 profile listed him as a @entity5 from @entity112 , wrote in one of thousands of postings on the subject			0
' whores of the @entity6 ... they want to run so that they intentionally fall down and reveal [ their figures ] , ' said a tweeter using the name mloven2100 , another @entity5			2
in @entity5 when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law			2
they are banned from driving their own cars and they are not permitted to run their own businesses			0
women are also not allowed inside main government buildings			0
travel is very difficult for women in @entity137			0
regardless of their age , they are not allowed to travel abroad without official permission from their guardians , which has to be authorised by the government			0
two years ago lingerie shops were staffed by men which could prove awkward when women had to discuss underwear sizing with the men			0
but it 's a year of change and women are now allowed to work in malls as sales clerks in lingerie shops thanks to several campaigns both by officials such as the past labour minister @entity160 and activists such as @entity162			2
but supporters of the athletes hijacked the hashtag to post messages in their defence			0
' i 'm proud of @entity5 women 's participation in the @entity6 , ' wrote @entity171 , a member of a prominent @entity5 tribe whose profile listed him as from @entity175			1
a woman who identified herself as @entity177 , a @entity5 , tweeted : ' women walking behind the @entity5 delegation is historic			0
next we 'll be carrying the flag and walking side by side , equal			0
' competing in the @entity6 is such a huge step for women in @entity5 , they are happy to abide by the strict caveats laid out by their country 's leaders			1
these include dressing modestly , being accompanied by a male guardian at all times and never mixing with men during the @entity6 , prince @entity189 told the @entity195 newspaper			0
@entity5 sportswomen may only take part if they do so ' wearing suitable clothing that complies with sharia ' ( @entity36 law ) and ' the athlete 's guardian agrees and attends with her ' , he said			1
' there must also be no mixing with men during the @entity6 , ' he added			0
' the athlete and her guardian must pledge not to break these conditions , ' he said			0
it comes after months of talks - with @entity5 @entity18 chiefs at one point insisting no women would be allowed to take part			1
@entity18 president @entity214 described their entry , confirmed by the @entity217 ahead of the july 9 deadline , as ' very positive news '			0
he said : ' the @entity18 has been working very closely with the @entity217 and i am pleased to see that our continued dialogue has come to fruition			0
' the @entity18 has been striving to ensure a greater gender balance at the @entity6 , and todayâ € ™ s news can be seen as an encouraging evolution			2
' with @entity5 female athletes now joining their fellow female competitors from @entity228 and @entity229 , it means that by @entity11 every @entity230 will have sent women to the @entity6			1
' adherence : in @entity5 when in public women are required to wear a black abaya and head scarf by law @entity228 and @entity229 , two other countries that have never sent any female athletes to the @entity6 , are also including women on their teams for the @entity241			1
with the @entity5 now following suit , it means all national teams competing in the games will include female athletes for the first time in @entity18 history			1
about 10,500 athletes are expected to compete in @entity250 , representing more than 200 national @entity18 committees			2
good news : @entity18 president @entity214 described their entry as ' very positive news ' @entity5 has been under pressure from the @entity18 and human - rights groups to include women athletes			1
the @entity18 has been in negotiations with the @entity5 for months on securing the participation of women			2
they said the two @entity5 athletes were entered by the @entity217 by the official deadline of july 9			0
rights groups hailed the decision as a step forward for @entity5 women in their quest for basic rights in a country that severely restricts them in public life			2
' it 's an important precedent that will create space for women to get rights and it will be hard for @entity5 hardliners to roll back , ' said @entity279 of the @entity281 - based @entity280			2
in the @entity5 city of @entity112 , @entity283 , a housewife in her 20s , said : ' this is fantastic news and it 's about time			0
maybe now people in @entity5 can see that females are capable of taking the reins			0
the world already knows that women can do great things - maybe now @entity5 can know that too			2
' @entity292 , a 28 - year - old @entity5 man who works at an investment firm in @entity112 , said the athletes were likely to face ' heavy criticism ' in the country , but that the government should support them			1
@entity5 @entity298 has a reputation as a cautious reformer and supporter of women 's rights			2
last year he announced plans to allow women to vote in municipal council elections and join the consultative @entity307 council			0
the country 's official sports body , the @entity310 , only caters to male athletes and women do not take part in sports at state schools			1
so women athletes have to fund themselves and arrange their own training , mostly abroad			0
a @entity5 official told @entity319 earlier this month @entity5 women participating in the @entity6 would have to obey the dress code of @entity36 law			1
he did not elaborate , but other conservative @entity99 countries have interpreted this to mean a headscarf , long sleeves and long pants			0
@entity5 is one of three countries , alongside @entity229 and @entity228 , never to have sent female athletes to the @entity6 but the latter two confirmed earlier this year that their delegations would include women			1
@entity229 has entered @entity333 ( athletics ) , while @entity228 has entered @entity335 ( swimming ) , @entity337 ( athletics ) , @entity339 ( table tennis ) and @entity341 ( shooting ) , who will also be her country 's flagbearer at the opening ceremony			2
video : watch the women train and hear how excited they are to go to the @entity6 ...			0

@entity10 will compete in judo after an agreement is reached on with @entity13 on the kind of headscarf she can wear

@entity10 and teammate @entity29 - the first women to represent the kingdom at any @entity6 - were included after pressure from the @entity18
