by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:16 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 21:00 est , 14 september 2012 credit - research firm @entity2 has downgraded its rating on @entity5 government debt from @entity6 to @entity6 - as the @entity7 announced its plans to try to stimulate the economy			1
the @entity7 announced it would buy $ 40 billion of mortgage bonds a month to help the recovery , but it will likely hurt the economy more than help it , @entity2 said			1
the plan will weaken the value of the dollar and push up prices for oil and other commodities leaving less for customers to spend on others things , the credit rating agency said			0
kick - start : the @entity7 plans to pump $ 40bn into the @entity5 economy through quantitative easing at the same time , @entity2 , which lowered its rating on the @entity5 from @entity6 + in april , warned that the federal government 's borrowing costs are likely to slowly rise as the global economy recovers			1
it comes as @entity33 stock markets rose after the @entity7 attempted to initiate economic recovery through its quantitative easing			1
the @entity7 's decision to inject $ 40bn ( £ 25bn ) a month in the @entity5 economy saw @entity37 , @entity39 and @entity40 stocks rise 2 % in afternoon trading			1
and as @entity33 markets rose , financially - troubled @entity42 and @entity43 were given a stay of execution after being given more time to reach financial targets			1
the launch of a third round of quantitative easing – dubbed @entity51 – prompted the @entity52 to jump 95.63 points to 5915.55 on a bumper day for investors and pensioners - adding £ 24 billion to the value of @entity37 ’s leading companies			1
fears for the world economy remain , as @entity62 finance ministers met in @entity63 to discuss measures to end the current eurozone debt crisis			1
@entity42 may get more time to reach targets under its 130 billion euro rescue package but is unlikely to receive more money , with a decision needed by the end of october			2
struggle : @entity2 announced that it is downgrading its rating on @entity5 debt to @entity6 - from @entity6 , citing the @entity7 's plans to stimulate the economy @entity43 , under pressure to spell out whether it needs more financial support , told euro zone finance ministers on friday it will present a new set of structural economic reforms with firm deadlines by the end of the month			1
@entity42 prime minister @entity88 , leading a country in its fifth year of recession at a time of rising discontent at home , wants two more years to implement economic reforms tied to the bailout to soften their impact			0
@entity92 managing director @entity91 said lenders may now agree to some sort of extension			0
delaying tactics : @entity42 prime minister @entity88 wants two more years to implement economic reforms she said : ' there are various ways to adjust : time is one and that needs to be considered as an option			0
' @entity42 's second bailout envisages @entity107 returning to international markets by 2015 , but with two consecutive parliamentary elections in may and june after political parties struggled to form a coalition , the country has lost ground on its reform agenda			2
deepening recession has also made the debt targets less attainable			0
in @entity43 , @entity117 's borrowing costs have fallen sharply since the @entity118 said it was ready to buy its bonds , but the scale of debt repayments it faces before the year - end and a deepening recession mean most analysts and policymakers believe it only a matter of time before it requires help			1
but at the @entity63 meeting , there was no talk of a third bailout			2
@entity133 finance minister @entity132 said : ' there will probably be no more money ( for @entity42 )			0
' it was not immediately clear how ministers will reconcile the issue , but , having made strenuous efforts to shore up @entity43 and @entity140 , it would make no sense to tip @entity42 into default now and plunge the currency bloc back into chaos			1
@entity43 finance minister @entity145 , pictured with @entity146 in may , said today he would implement a new set of reforms in @entity43 to boost growth @entity107 , where @entity33 's debt crisis began nearly three years ago , has been boosted by a decision to give bailed - out @entity152 more time to meet its fiscal targets as economic recession saps @entity156 's ability to deliver			1
economy minister @entity145 told journalists after meeting his peers in @entity63 : ' we will adopt a new set of reforms to boost growth ... it will be in line with the recommendations of the @entity165			2
' although the extent of the shortfall will not be known until a report by lenders in october , @entity42 is unlikely to win back investor confidence quickly and meet its targets , which include a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of economic output in 2014			2
@entity175 officials said @entity107 is way behind on its debt - cutting programme , suggesting @entity42 will need funding support past 2014 until it can return to market			2
@entity43 's 2013 budget and a detailed audit of the capital needs of its banking sector are both due on sept. 28			0
for the first time in months , ministers met at a moment when market pressure for immediate action to solve the sovereign debt crisis is easing , rather than mounting			0
the @entity118 's announcement that it could buy unlimited amounts of @entity43 bonds , should it agree a programme with the euro zone bailout fund , brought @entity43 10 - year bond yields down from 7.64 percent on july 24 to 5.62 percent on thursday			0
@entity92 director @entity91 said lenders may now agree to some sort of time extension for financially - troubled @entity42 @entity140 yields have fallen to around 5 percent and the euro rose above $ 1.30 after the @entity7 announced a new programme of asset purchases to support the economy			1
that increases the temptation for @entity43 , and @entity175 paymaster @entity40 , to try to get by without an assistance programme that would be politically unpopular in both @entity117 and @entity207			0
each time market stress has eased in the nearly three - year crisis , @entity40 leaders have said they see no urgent need to act			0
' there is no more room for complacency than there was six months ago , but we are moving in the right direction , ' @entity212 cautioned			0
@entity43 is reluctant to ask for help because prime minister @entity220 fears a political backlash at home , but he may eventually have no choice given @entity117 's borrowing needs			0
a @entity40 official said privately that @entity207 did not want to see @entity43 pushed into an unnecessary rescue application at a time when its funding conditions were improving , adding a @entity43 bailout was not inevitable .			0
