by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 04:54 est , 2 april 2013 stealing the show : @entity2 turned heads in this tight royal blue suit @entity5 is a day of celebration and feasting			1
a day of fluffy chicks and rebirth			2
a day that @entity2 chose to hatch her new look upon an unsuspecting world			1
and crikey , what a vision of sizzling peacockery to flutter before our tired eyes ! is it a bird ? is it a plane ? is it a royal cry for help ? do not adjust your sets			2
pop on a pair of these anti-dazzle , mortification - proof fashion visors before you peek			2
for yes , that really is the @entity2 attending the traditional @entity5 service at @entity32 with other members of the @entity34			1
that really is our @entity36 strutting into @entity38 looking like the chief purser on a @entity41 late - night flight to @entity42			1
on this most holy of days , for reasons that have yet to become clear , @entity2 chose an electric blue suit , sculpted over her body and clinging tighter than the shrink - wrap on a pair of slightly flattened avocados			1
the skirt had an @entity51 - dare - you zip all the way up the back , matching the fruity bondage zips that tracked up each arm			2
@entity2 teamed this with a racy pair of cocktail stick heels and topped off her ay - caramba ! new image with the kind of towering , peacock feather hat that would have had @entity64 begging for mercy			1
yes , she looked fabulous , totally amazing — but was it really an appropriate outfit for church ? to be honest , her suit is the kind of thing you ’d expect to see on a flirty lieutenant serving cocktails on the bridge of the @entity75 — not on a member of the @entity34 wiggling into a holy service			1
so what does this lemming - like lurch in style direction mean for a countess previously noted for taking decades - long refuge in forgiving pastels and ill - fitting frocks , not to mention her penchant for fifty shades of beige ? first , ask yourself this			2
if the countess of @entity93 ’s @entity5 outfit could speak , what would it be saying ? it would be screaming : ‘ look at me ! ’ it would be shouting : ‘ move over , @entity97			1
’ it would be hollering : ‘ stuff you , @entity100 ! ’ it might even whisper : ‘ never mind my bum , does my royal standing look big in this ? ’ certainly , the arrival of perfectly groomed @entity97 and her attention - grabbing sister @entity100 on the scene caused a fluttering in the royal dovecotes			0
unless they wanted to disappear even further into the margins of irrelevance , the royal ladies have had to up their fashion game and project themselves better at public events			0
look at @entity114 and @entity115 , who now try very , very hard to win favour with their silly hats and shortie skirts			0
they fail to understand that they can not wheedle their way into public affection by looking fashionable : they have to do stuff			0
fashion : @entity2 in peach at @entity129 ’ wedding ( left ) and navy ( right ) for the @entity132 ’s @entity131 in the meantime , is it merely competition from the @entity97 that is behind the countess of @entity2 ’s transformation from frumpy @entity138 to royal fashionista ? perhaps , but the truth is that @entity2 has undergone an incredible style renaissance over the past few years			1
last month , this was recognised when the 48 - year - old countess was announced as the first ever patron of the @entity146 , a position she will hold for the next three years			2
the edgy @entity5 outfit shows she is taking her new credentials seriously — perhaps too seriously			1
yet anything is an improvement on the horrors that went before			0
in the past , style and @entity2 were two ships that never passed in the night			1
if they did , they crashed into each other with a loss of all hands on deck and some terrible damage to the beam end			0
fashion turkey : christmas 2003 court jester : may 2002 non-starter : @entity165 , 2001 yes , we were all guilty of terrible fashion crimes in the @entity168 and @entity169 , but @entity2 must shoulder - pad a disproportionate amount of blame			1
those boxy @entity173 - alike blazers , those sherbet pink shantung silk skirts , those shiny tights that look like pearlised sausage casings , jumpers with anchors on them			0
when she started dating @entity181 in 1993 — they married in 1999 , so their engagement lasted an eternity for royal circles — fresh horrors emerged			0
at @entity165 , you could always depend on @entity2 to wear the wrong colour in the wrong shape , with a hideola hat to top it off			1
on formal occasions , she was the classic @entity191 rose ; a bursting bud crammed into a strapless , too - tight dress ; a detonated tube of toothpaste with a matching clutch			0
it is not just that @entity2 is one of those women who just looks better and better the older she gets , it is also that she has found — finally — an age - appropriate , effortlessly elegant style that suits her			1
sexier shoes , nicer colours , clothes that fit better			0
caped crusader : february 2009 sweater - girl : 1994 a boyish - botch in 1994 @entity2 has found salvation in all of these things			1
it may have taken a long time , but she got there in the end			0
a personal trainer and regular pilates sessions have also helped this newly stylish royal to bloom			0
at @entity129 ’ wedding , @entity2 stole the show in peach chiffon			1
at the @entity220 service at @entity221 ’s last year , she was flawless in navy blue			2
at @entity224 , over @entity223 , she wore an oatmeal duster coat and statement hat with easy style			0
by the time she scrambles up the royal ranks and makes it to duchess , she is going to be just perfect			0
and that was her plan all along			0
in royal circles , @entity2 is known as @entity235			1
this is because the @entity132 absolutely adores her perfectly behaved , sugar - sprinkled daughter - in - law			0
while @entity238 has always been @entity239 ’s favourite child — a female echo of his blunderbuss ways — sweet @entity2 is the companionable and biddable daughter the @entity132 never had			1
unless you count that unfortunate business with the fake sheikh back in 2001 ( @entity2 was caught on tape disparaging @entity245 and making political comments ) , she has n’t put a foot wrong			2
one of the reasons we all love the @entity132 is that @entity250 is dutiful but understated			0
and until she climbed into her @entity252 cyber suit at the weekend , @entity2 was the same			1
so , just when she has been getting it so right , let ’s hope she does n’t start going horribly wrong , egged on by all her new fashion pals			0
being photographed so much puts huge pressure on the younger royals — but it never pays to try too hard			0
you ’ve proved you have a real sense of style , @entity2			2
now , just go out and enjoy it !			0

@entity5 was day when @entity2 chose to hatch a new look
she strutted into @entity38 in an electric blue suit sculpted over her figure
the countess looked fabulous but was it really appropriate for a church ?
