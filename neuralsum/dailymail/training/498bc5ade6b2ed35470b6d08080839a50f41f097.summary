owner @entity0 is planning a power - packed dual raid at @entity2 on @entity3 with @entity5 - trained duo @entity4 and @entity6			1
as expected , @entity6 runs in the @entity8 @entity7 but @entity0 has revealed the @entity9 is his ' preferred target ' for unbeaten @entity4 , winner of last season 's @entity12 at the @entity14 as well as being successful at @entity15 last month			1
that potentially sets up an absorbing clash with @entity20 - trained @entity19 winner @entity18 and , possibly , @entity21 if all goes well for him in saturday 's @entity23 at @entity14			2
@entity9 is the ' preferred target ' for unbeaten @entity4 @entity0 said : ' i have a lot of respect for @entity18 but the @entity9 seems a good race for us			1
that is my preferred target			1
' @entity32 at @entity33 will be another re-match between @entity34 and @entity35 and i am not keen to take those guys on too quickly			0
' the @entity7 will be a first try at three miles for @entity6 , the 2013 @entity39 winner			1
he won the @entity40 on his comeback last month and @entity0 revealed the @entity5 - team are keen to have him as fresh as possible for the @entity7 after learning from his defeat in last season 's @entity44 at @entity14			2
@entity4 owner @entity0 ( right ) with fellow owner @entity47 at @entity48 last month @entity0 said : ' i had a conversation with @entity50 ( @entity51 ) and @entity5 afterwards and they thought they had done too much work with him			2
' this season we have kept him fresher			0
he is certainly bred to stay and we have every hope he will win			0
he is in great form			0
' meanwhile , @entity58 , assistant to trainer @entity59 , says there is growing optimism that @entity62 could make the race after his long absence			0
@entity58 said : ' there is still work to do and it is an upward curve but if there are no more kinks along the way there is a good chance			0
