you could be forgiven for not recognising the face in @entity4 's latest underwear campaign			1
the stylish black and white photos show a torso that is suitably chiselled , immaculately groomed hair , a dash of designer stubble and , of course , the brightest - and tightest - white pants			2
@entity13 @entity12 , 31 , has undergone a startling transformation in recent years ; his once skinny frame replaced with a rippling physique that could put many a male model to shame			1
when images from the glamorous shoot were released , they quickly went viral			0
wow ! what happened to @entity12 ? the superstar dj , said to be worth £ 44million , is the star of a new underwear campaign by @entity4 ... but he was n't always to easy on the eye pre-muscles : the 31 - year - old scotsman from @entity28 , pictured here in 2007 and 2009 respectively , once favoured the skinny - boy look with longer locks and paler skin swoon : the @entity13 has all but given up alcohol and has a regular exercise routine that has honed his body ... he joins @entity37 and @entity38 as one of @entity4 's boys in briefs @entity12 , said to be the world 's richest dj with a personal wealth of around £ 44million , says his enviable six - pack is down to largely ditching alcohol - he has n't drunk for a year - and a dedication to working out			1
the pop star , from @entity28 in @entity48 , seems to be enjoying what has become known as the ' @entity51 effect ' , where men get more attractive as they advance in years			1
in the boy band 's heyday , the @entity56 star was famously the least attractive member , something he himself admitted to - and trailed in the wake of his more athletically - blessed peers when it came to fan mail			1
yet in the group 's renaissance , @entity51 has captured the hearts of a new generation of fans			1
following a strict diet , the songwriter has shed the pounds that once dogged him and managed to keep the weight off			1
a smart haircut , light beard and personal stylist have seen his popularity soar			0
after the weight loss , he said : ' i ’ve just not got the sort of body where i can pick and choose what i eat			2
i ’ve got to go for one thing and stick by it			0
so i ’ve tried not to have sugar and caffeine , etc , and it ’s boring , it ’s really boring			0
' but it works for me			0
the result is that i feel good			0
' better second time around : gone is the peroxide hair of @entity51 in the first incarnation of @entity56 ... replaced by a gentle quiff , light tan and more slimline figure not so @entity94 : on the set of @entity98 television show @entity96 , mr @entity94 sported bouncy hair and double denim but has grown older gracefully , and bagged a beautiful lady to boot			0
the actor is pictured earlier this year with new wife @entity103 not always @entity104 : @entity106 's flame - red hair , ( captured left at @entity107 in 2003 ) has softened with age and a career in the @entity110 has ensured his slight physique is a thing of the past bleached hair , two earrings and a shiny jacket : the fashion disasters of a young @entity117 , pictured left in 1997 and , right , spotted last month looking positively debonair in @entity118 not even the thinking woman 's crumpet ... @entity121 took a while to shine but a hit series , @entity124 , in the @entity125 transformed the way the opposite sex viewed him channelling @entity128 ? an early shot of actor @entity130 ( left ) feels a long way from 007			1
right , the actor in his more familiar guise at the press call for new @entity137 film @entity135 in december last year he 's not the only male celebrity to have improved with age however			1
@entity141 heartthrob @entity94 's legion of adoring fans will mostly agree that the @entity145 actor / director has matured like a fine wine , suiting a smattering of grey hair much more than the more bouffant look that he sported in the @entity151			2
other stars offering hope to mere mortals fearing their middle years include @entity121 , who became an unlikely desirable as the front man of @entity125 television hit @entity124			0
the latest incarnation of @entity137 , @entity130 , has definitely become more attractive as he 's clocked up more miles			1
photos of the actor in his 20s show badly - dyed blonde hair and none of the super-fit physique that 007 fans have lusted over			0
chart - topping makeover : fear of appearing on television on a saturday evening , on @entity169 show @entity170 , propelled the @entity172 lead singer , @entity171 , into re-thinking his look hirsute suits you , sir : @entity37 ( pictured left in 1999 ) has changed his looks many times but most will agree his brooding , bearded look since retiring from football is his best so much better blonde : @entity183 sporting darker hair and a fresher face back in 2002 and looking much more delicious last year at the @entity185 in 2014 � � the fashion designer @entity186 has n't been shy in showing off his gym - honed body in recent years but was n't always quite so muscular ; photos of the designer from his pre-work out stage reveal unkempt hair and an unremarkable physique			1
younger stars who , like @entity12 , seem to have grown into their bodies as they reach their thirties include @entity117			1
the former @entity199 's youthful looks , complete with an earring in both lobes , might not have attracted the attention of now - pregnant wife @entity203			2
and prince @entity106 might not have enjoyed so much female attention without his @entity110 training routine			0
photos of the prince as a teenager , dressed in @entity107 gowns , reveal a slim frame and a redder tint to his hair			0
other remarkable transformations from geek to god include @entity171 , frontman with band @entity172 , who spruced up via weight loss and a beard , to appear on @entity219 's @entity170			2
the star blamed the excesses of touring for his previously chubby appearance , saying : ' i used to drink loads and i was n't as happy as i am now			2
i used to just get stuck into junk food on tour			0
