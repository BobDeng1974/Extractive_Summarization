by @entity0 set back : @entity1 now has no hope of passing the legislation for a vote on @entity6 membership before the next @entity7 after 245 peers voted to halt it a bill to enshrine a @entity12 referendum in law was described as a ‘ dead parrot ’ last night after @entity15 and the @entity16 united to block it			1
nearly 250 peers voted to halt the @entity19 – backed by @entity1 – which would guarantee a nationwide in - out vote on @entity6 membership in 2017			1
peers passed two amendments to the legislation , effectively guaranteeing that it will run out of time in this parliamentary session			2
@entity28 mp @entity27 echoed a @entity30 sketch in pronouncing its demise			1
he said : ‘ as i understand it from the @entity34 , the @entity33 is now , in effect , a dead parrot			0
’ mr @entity1 has vowed to renegotiate @entity38 ’s relationship with @entity39 before holding a referendum in 2017			2
but he could not introduce government legislation because of @entity16 opposition			0
instead , @entity43 backed a @entity44 introduced by @entity46 mp @entity45 , which was passed in the @entity47 after @entity15 and the @entity16 abstained			1
labour leader @entity48 has refused to make his position on the @entity50 but @entity15 and @entity16 peers tabled 73 amendments to the @entity19 , many of them frivolous , to kill it off			1
@entity54 voted by 245 votes to 158 to amend the wording of the question that would be put to voters in the referendum			0
@entity60 : @entity27 compared the @entity1 - backed legislation for a vote on @entity6 membership in 2017 to the collapsed , unfixable car in @entity30 's renowned ' dead parrot ' sketch spoof : shopkeeper @entity68 and customer @entity69 discuss a @entity71 parrot , used as a euphemism for the death of @entity38 culture the change was backed by 67 @entity16 , 138 @entity15 , 30 crossbench and just three conservatives			1
@entity6 red tape is costing @entity38 jobs and has imposed ‘ unjustified ’ blockages on cheap energy from shale gas , @entity1 said yesterday			0
addressing the @entity84 in @entity85 , the prime minister complained that ‘ overwritten ’ employment directives were driving employers away from the @entity38			0
he also said that failure to back shale gas exploration in @entity12 would cause businesses and investors to ‘ head elsewhere ’			0
the opportunities it presented could be undermined if the @entity6 imposed unnecessary regulations			0
they also passed a second amendment that would require an impact assessment on the potential consequences of an @entity6 exit			0
the change means the @entity101 will have to go back to the @entity47 for further consideration			1
since private member ’s @entity19 can only be debated on fridays , there is now no prospect of the legislation going through before the next @entity7			1
lord @entity107 , conservative @entity108 , accused @entity15 and the @entity16 of ‘ yet another u-turn ’ on their position on an @entity6 referendum			2
‘ having accepted this @entity19 in the @entity113 , they are now trying to kill it in the @entity34 , ’ he said			0
a @entity43 source said the @entity115 would try to get another mp to reintroduce the legislation in the @entity47 in the next session of @entity118 .			2

nearly 250 peers voted to halt @entity19 for 2017 @entity6 membership referendum
*eurosceptic* @entity27 cited @entity30 sketch to mock *pm* - backed vote
means change will have to go back to @entity47 for further consideration
now no prospect of legislation passing before next @entity7
