by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 04:17 est , 12 november 2013 a sea fern has grown in a landlocked area for the first time after its unique marine habitat was created by the amount of salt spread on the roads			2
wildlife experts say the plant - which usually grows by the ocean - has been tricked into thinking the windswept grass verge is a coastal beach front			2
the withered plant , 40 miles from the nearest coastline , is thought to be surviving because of the high amounts of salt sprayed on the road over the last two cold winters			1
the sea fern was discovered growing alongside the @entity20 at @entity21 , north east of @entity23 , in @entity24 , by local volunteer recorder @entity25 ( pictured at site ) it was discovered growing alongside the @entity20 at @entity21 , north east of @entity23 , in @entity24 , by local volunteer recorder @entity25			1
the verge was given ' @entity32 ' status 16 years ago because of its unique flora			0
wildlife experts say the plant - which usual grows by the ocean - has been tricked into thinking the windswept grass verge is a coastal beach front @entity25 said : ' i was looking mainly at the flora of the banks , including young junipers , but just happened to notice the sea fern - grass right on the edge of the road , where the verge would be affected by salt spray			1
' it is one of those normally coastal plants that are spreading inland along the edge of roads treated with de-icing salt			0
' sea fern - grass , also known as @entity54 , grows in open , sunny brackish soils that are rich in nutrients			1
it resembles a miniature form of perennial ryegrass and has stems that are on average 15 cm long with spikelets that are between 4 - 8 mm long , sea fern - grass is rarely found inland but is common on the coasts of @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and southern @entity67			1
' i expect that it will be found by other main roads where there are other salt - tolerant plants , but walking along such roads is not very pleasant , which might be why mine is the first record , ' added @entity25			0
she excitedly sent a sample off for analysis , where stunned experts confirmed the find			0
@entity80 , data officer for @entity24 and @entity82 , said more volunteers were needed to study the spread of the plant			2
' each verge has a volunteer who checks on the condition of the verge and records the wildlife found there , ' she said			0
' we are always looking for more people to volunteer to record sightings so we hope that @entity25 's discovery will galvanise more people to come forward and help us record species			0
' who knows what new species we 'll find next ? qualifications in botany are n't required and full support will be given to anyone joining the volunteer scheme			0
' we do n't need people to be experts , just keen to learn			0

it can be spotted by its distinctive red stem among other vegetation and is easiest to find when it blossoms with its small white flowers			2
unlike most species of grass , sea fern - grass only lives for one year .			1

experts believe sea fern - grass was tricked into thinking it was on the coast
discovered 40 miles from the nearest coastline on the @entity20 in @entity24
the grass can be spotted by its distinctive red stem and its 4 - *8mm* spikelets
