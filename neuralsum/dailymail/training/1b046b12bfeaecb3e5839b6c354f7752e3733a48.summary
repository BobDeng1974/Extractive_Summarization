an inquiry into the trust this week reported a ‘ disaster ’ in the care of vulnerable and elderly patients at the hospital and said it revealed failings at every level of the @entity12			1
mr @entity1 said it was wrong that nobody had been ‘ brought to book ’ at @entity18 in the wake of the report			1
‘ i think it ’s absolutely outrageous that potentially more than a thousand people lost their lives because of poor care and not a single person has been brought to book , ’ he said			1
‘ this was a public inquiry that was designed to help us understand why the system did n’t pick up what went wrong but i think it is absolutely disgraceful with all those things happening , whether it is doctors , nurses or managers , nobody has been held to account			1
’ asked whether the information should be passed to the police , he added : ‘ well that evidence is in the public domain			2
and you know , it ’s there for the police - and it ’s there for the professional bodies , the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) and the @entity50 ) to look at and they should do that			2
’ mr @entity1 said that it was not for him to judge which individuals should be prosecuted			1
‘ as a politician , i am not in a position to say this nurse is guilty , this nurse is not , and all these things have to be decided at arm ’s length following due process , ’ he told the @entity54			2
‘ this is about people ’s careers and livelihood and there has to be fairness of course			2
’ scandal : an inquiry found up to 1,200 patients died on casualty wards at @entity74 between 2005 and 2009 due to an obsession with targets @entity77 , who led the inquiry into the @entity18 , said there were failings at every level of the @entity12 and that the culture among healthcare staff must change			1
he said : ‘ what we need to avoid is yet another wholesale reorganisation of abolishing organisations and creating new ones			2
sir @entity89 , the head of the @entity12 , has resisted calls to step down over the scandal at @entity92 ‘ this is about how people behave when they go to work and their ability to raise concerns and be honest about what ’s going on in their hospitals			2
’ the change would only happen when @entity12 managers , clinicians and staff started to address the failings ‘ rather than waiting to be told what to do from @entity107 , or by the top of the @entity12 , ’ he added			0
sir @entity89 , the head of the @entity12 , has resisted calls to step down over the scandal at @entity92			0
@entity111 , who headed an earlier investigation into the hospital in 2009 , said : ‘ if this were a private sector organisation that had failed to such an extent , we would be calling for the boss to take responsibility			0
‘ there is a big case to answer for the creation of that culture			0
’ patients ’ campaigner @entity123 , whose elderly mother @entity125 died at @entity92 , called for individuals in the @entity12 to be held accountable for the failings in care			1
she said : ‘ this is an opportunity to put down the gauntlet and say enough is enough			0
‘ from today you will be held accountable for your actions - it ’s no good saying in the future you will be held accountable			0
‘ we want accountability for the hundreds of deaths and the suffering our loved ones had to put up with			0
’ @entity12 medical director professor sir @entity140 has launched a review into five other trusts where there were 3,000 more deaths than expected between 2010 and 2012			0
patients ’ campaigner @entity123 , ( left ) whose elderly mother @entity125 ( right ) died at @entity92 , called for individuals in the @entity12 to be held accountable for the failings in care a whistleblower at scandal - hit @entity92 today urged others in similar situations to act as she did			1
@entity151 , a former casualty nurse at the hospital , said healthcare workers who saw poor care had a duty to speak out			1
asked on @entity156 whether she would have blown the whistle if she had known that nobody would be disciplined over what happened , she said : ' just because you think nothing 's going to happen does n't mean you do n't try , and that would be my message to other nurses out there right now , who may be in a very similar situation , that if they 're witnessing poor standards of care , they have a duty to speak out			1
' she said the report by @entity77 into the @entity18 had highlighted that there may be a legal obligation to report wrongdoing			0
' but i think it goes much further			0
the @entity179 report can only go so far , it 's up now to the individuals and organisations to take that forward to implement change			0
' ms @entity151 said that people should be held accountable for their actions			0
' i think individuals have to be accountable for their own behaviour , and from a nursing point of view , you have a duty of care for your patients , and if you are not delivering that , and particularly if you are doing harm , you need to be made accountable			1
' asked if there had been a culture of neglect at the hospital , she said : ' there was , and there was a culture of bullying as well , both towards staff and patients			1
' she said there were ' immense ' pressures on the nurses			0
' we were hugely understaffed , and had very poor equipment , inadequate equipment , and that obviously led to the nurses being under immense pressure , and there was pressure to always meet the four hour accident and emergency ward target			0
that had a knock on effect to patient care			2
