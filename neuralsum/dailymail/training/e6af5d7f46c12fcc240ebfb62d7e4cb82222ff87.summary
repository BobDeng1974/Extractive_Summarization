by @entity1 reporter published : 02:03 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 08:27 est , 10 january 2014 the polar vortex has been blamed for delaying flights and costing the @entity6 economy billions in lost business , but the arctic blast has given ice harvesters a head start			1
the annual collection of chunks of ice from a @entity15 lake was able to start nearly a month earlier than previous years thanks to the recent cold snap			1
crews armed with saws and picks collected the blocks on thursday for a @entity23 campsite , which uses the ice as a natural freezer			0
cool idea : the giant ice cubes float in @entity28 before being hooked out first cut : @entity30 uses a custom - built circular saw to cut into the frozen lake dig in : the saw cuts through the lake ice , which must be 12in thick for a harvest to take place last year the workers could n't begin sawing the 16in by 19in blocks , each weighing about 160lb , until february 6 , because of warm and wet conditions			1
the harvest , which has taken place for more than a century , ca n't begin until ice on @entity28 in @entity44 is 12in thick			0
at that point , a team of workers descend on the lake to collect up to 200 tons of ice that will be stored in specially insulated houses that will preserve them until summer			0
using a specially adapted circular saw , the lake is carved into chunks before the crew use ice picks to haul the blocks into trucks			2
the giant ice cubes are then driven to the campground , where they are stored in special cabins that prevent them from melting			1
campers at @entity65 will be able to use the blocks to help chill their ice boxes and keep supplies cool during their vacations later this year			2
ice fishing : the blocks , which weigh about 160lb , are loaded on to a truck tough work : @entity72 guides the blocks from the truck to the ice house summer preparations : @entity76 , left , gets ready to grab a block of ice as @entity79 stacks them at @entity65 campground			0
