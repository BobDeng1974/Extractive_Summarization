flowers , dress , caterer and a priest brave enough to jump out of a perfectly good plane ... that was the to - do list for daredevil newlyweds @entity6 and @entity8 before they took the most literal of leaps into married life			1
@entity11 was clearly in the air for the thrill - seeking duo as they exchanged vows on board a plane and then jumped out of it from 16,000ft with the best man , bridesmaid and the pastor close behind			2
@entity6 , 32 and @entity8 , 46 , from @entity22 , @entity23 , then sealed their union with a kiss in mid-air			1
@entity8 is an experienced skydiver and president of the local skydiving club with more than 1,000 jumps to his name , but @entity6 had to do a tandem jump with an instructor			1
both were in their element though , and the instructor attached to @entity6 's back came in handy when the pair combined in freefall for a smooch			1
time to leap : the couple and their wedding party prepare to jump from the plane sealed with a kiss : the instructor tandem jumping with @entity6 helps the pair have a smooch in freefall @entity6 said the wedding took over a year to plan and the stakes were higher than most weddings when it came to the weather			1
but she said the toughest part of the organisation was finding a pastor to perform the ceremony who was willing to take a leap of faith with them			0
' @entity8 has been at the @entity74 club for 20 years and is an active jumper , i have done many tandem skydive jumps so i came up with the idea of having our ceremony inside the aircraft , ' said @entity6 , who helps skydivers prepare to jump and edits their videos			1
' for us a skydive was the best way to close our marriage			0
the biggest challenge was to find a pastor brave enough to jump with us			2
back to earth : the happy couple arrive on the ground to cheers from their waiting guests exchanging rings : finding a priest willing to jump was the hardest part of their wedding preparations blushing bride : @entity6 jumped in her wedding dress with full hair and make , and high - top sneakers ' we felt super happy to jump from the plane as man and wife and to be able to freefall together with our bridesmaid , best man and the pastor was amazing			1
' it was very cold ( -18 degrees celcius ) at the exit altitude of 4,700 metres but beautiful			0
' while not worried about the jump , @entity6 admits there were some shaky moments during the in - air ceremony			2
' we were more worried about the pastor his hands were shaking throughout the ceremony , ' she said			0
no sign of nerves : @entity6 appears relaxed as she soars through the air after their airplane wedding ceremony leap of faith : the priest ( bottom ) did his first tandem skydive after marrying @entity6 and @entity8 ' at one point he was shaking so much he even dropped one of the rings , luckily we found it quickly			1
' we were lucky that the weather was good enough for us to jump otherwise the wedding would have took place at the airport and we 'd have done the jump the next day			0
@entity8 said his wedding day was ' perfect '			2
' i was just so happy to hear @entity6 say " yes " - it was a wonderful day thanks to all the nice people who helped make it possible , ' the groom says			2
@entity144 , who captured the couple 's skydive wedding on camera , said it was a magical day			0
grounded couple : @entity8 and @entity6 land within moments of each other as their life together begun formal proceedings : @entity8 suited up and @entity6 switched her high - tops for heels once on the ground he said : ' it was really something unique , i 've been skydiving for many years and never seen anything like this			1
' despite wearing her wedding dress and having just had her hair done the bride seemed to take the jump well , she was n't nervous at all			0
' the pastor was the most nervous , he 'd never skydived before so i think he was a little scared			0
' with so many people jumping all at the same time it could have been dangerous , there 's a chance people can collide in the air			0
' but luckily the instructors were very safe and knew exactly what they were doing			0
