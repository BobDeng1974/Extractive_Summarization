@entity4 , the son of @entity6 mayor @entity5 has been accepted into several top colleges including @entity9 universities @entity2 and @entity3 , sources close to @entity1 said			1
the mayor 's son , who is 17 and a senior at @entity13 will make his decision by the end of the month , leaving @entity5 in a situation familiar to millions across the country			1
despite his six figure salary as mayor and six figure rental income from the two properties he and his wife own in @entity23 , @entity5 is now expected to turn to financial aid to help pay for his son 's elite education			1
proud family : @entity4 ( left ) with his father , @entity6 mayor @entity5 , his mother @entity29 and sister , @entity31 outside their home in @entity34 , @entity23 ' there 's going to be a big challenge in figuring out financial aid and visits and all sorts of stuff , ' said mr. @entity5 to the @entity41 last week			1
but while @entity4 's choice of college is obviously a private matter , how his parents - as champions of the underprivileged - will fund it , is obviously of public interest			1
indeed , the almost prohibitive cost of college for some in the @entity53 is often pointed to as a failing of @entity56 politicians and their policies			2
however , with a salary of $ 225,000 and his daughter , @entity31 , already enrolled at @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity5 has a good case for financial aid			0
@entity9 : @entity4 has been accepted into @entity2 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) universities and will make his decision at the end of the month home for the moment : the @entity5 family moved into @entity1 on the @entity70 of @entity6 late last year @entity71 : $ 68,050 @entity72 : $ 66,800 @entity73 : $ 63,440 @entity2 : $ 63,250 @entity74 : $ 60,201 @entity3 : $ 59,428 @entity75 : $ 58,965 @entity76 : $ 47,286 indeed , her annual tuition , room and board fees come to $ 55,000 a year and if @entity4 was to attend @entity2 , that would come to in excess of $ 60,000			1
faced with more than $ 100,000 a year in tuition fees , the mayor may not find himself disqualified from seeking aid said @entity86 , the publisher of @entity87 , which works in financial aid			0
' when you have colleges that are charging 50 , 60 , $ 70,000 a year , everybody is going to struggle to pay for college , ' he said to the @entity41			0
however , @entity86 admitted in the case of the mayor he is talking about the 1 percent of top earners in the country			0
@entity97 and his wife @entity29 received $ 52,200 in rent from a @entity34 , @entity23 , home his mother lived in and the family home also in @entity34 they left last year rakes in $ 4,975 a month			2
combined , the two properties value is $ 2.8 million			0
however , regardless of how the @entity5 's pay for college , @entity4 appears to be a strong candidate			2
he is a champion debater and counts political philosophy his favorite subject according to the @entity41 .			0

@entity4 , 17 , to make his decision by the end of the month
his father has said that despite his six - figure salary the family will struggle to meet cost to send son to @entity9 *school*
