by @entity1 reporter published : 15:05 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 20:48 est , 21 november 2012 one of the world ’s richest men , @entity5 property magnate @entity4 , today lost his appeal against a court decision to award his ex-mistress two @entity9 properties he claimed were his			1
in july last year , high court judge mr @entity10 ruled in july last year that married mr @entity4 - who he described as ' one of the world ’s truly super rich ' - lied when he claimed that masseuse @entity15 was only his employee , and not his mistress			1
though mr @entity4 did not appeal that finding , he claimed that the judge wrongly focused on the nature of the relationship when he should have concentrated on legal documents he claimed showed he was intended to retain ownership of two homes on @entity24 , @entity9 , which he bought for £ 1.5 and £ 1.6 million in 2008			2
at the @entity25 : @entity4 , pictured left , today lost his appeal against a court decision to award his former mistress @entity15 , pictured right , two @entity9 properties he insisted belonged to him but lord justice @entity30 dismissed his appeal today , stating : ' the nature of the entire case , and ultimately the rival cases about the disputed properties , was coloured by mr @entity4 ’s untruthful and dishonest account of his relationship with ms @entity15			1
its true nature gave the explanation for the acquisition of these properties			0
' in the ruling under challenge , mr @entity10 rejected mr @entity4 ’s claim to ownership of the properties and found that one of the properties was intended as a gift to her , while the other was bought with money he gave her			1
mr @entity4 had argued at the @entity25 that ms @entity15 was only an employee and that she was intended to run the one of the houses as a hotel enterprise			1
he said the house formed part of his complex and secretive business model known as ' @entity60 ' , named after a @entity62 businessman from ms @entity15 ’s hometown but ms @entity15 claimed that she was his mistress and that they met after he responded to a newspaper advertisement she placed seeking a ' spouse '			2
she claimed he encouraged her to emulate him and @entity67 , who started with nothing and built a commercial empire			0
the rightful owner : the court found that one of the properties , the @entity74 , was given as a gift to ms @entity15 while the other was bought with money mr @entity4 had given her though mr justice @entity10 found that ms @entity15 was ' frequently an untruthful person ' , he said in his written ruling in july 2011 that on the issues of their relationship he was satisfied that she was telling the truth and mr @entity4 was not			1
he said : ' she was not a business functionary but a sexual companion			0
in this regard , mr @entity4 has not incorrectly recollected matters			2
he has been deliberately untruthful			0
' he added : ' mr @entity4 was a generally truthful person : but he has lied to me because , i think , he sees it necessary for his honour and his reputation to demonstrate that he can control people within his realm of management , and ms @entity15 resists his control			2
' he certainly does not care about the money , which is to him next to nothing			0
his case could not have been harder fought			0
' mr @entity4 ’s lawyers argued on appeal that their client ’s testimony about his relationship status with ms @entity15 should have had no bearing on the case in light of contemporaneous documents that showed the clear intention that he would be the true owner of the properties			1
in written submissions to the court they claimed that it was clear that mr @entity4 might have had reasons for lying about whether he had had an affair with ms @entity15 which had nothing to do with whether he was telling the truth about the property ownership agreement			1
however , dismissing the appeal , @entity118 said that the judge was not bound simply to construe the documents ' in isolation from the realities of the case ' , and that he was correct to have regard to the whole of the evidence			0
he added : ' for reasons that the judge explains at substantial length , he found that the relationship between mr @entity4 and ms @entity15 was not as mr @entity4 contended			1
' the relationship was one of companionship and was sexual in its nature			0
this was clearly a significant feature of the case to which the judge quite properly gave weight			0
' he said that mr @entity4 had lavished ' large sums , which to ordinary people would seem extraordinary ' on ms @entity15 , providing jewels , watches and furs to the value of some £ 123,000 on top of money and properties			1
he continued : ' the fact that mr @entity4 had lied so compendiously about this relationship and this type of expenditure , as the judge quite properly found on the evidence before him , was obviously highly relevant to the issues in the case			2
these matters put the property acquisitions in context			0
' i reject entirely the submission for mr @entity4 that these matters were of no relevance at all and that all one had to do was to construe , in a formalistic legal fashion , the language of the solicitors ’ documents and certain individual remarks taken from a series of confused and confusing telephone conversations			0
' the @entity25 ordered mr @entity4 to pay ms @entity15 ’s legal costs , and make a £ 50,000 payment up front .			2

property magnate @entity4 appealed against court ruling giving his mistress two @entity9 houses - claiming @entity15 was just an employee
but court found pair did have a relationship and one @entity9 house was given to her as a gift
ms @entity15 bought the other @entity9 home with money given to her by mr @entity4
