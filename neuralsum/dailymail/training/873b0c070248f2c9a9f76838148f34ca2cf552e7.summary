he said : ' it 's absolutely shocking			2
we found out by @entity7			2
everybody was in bed feeling @entity68 and now we are not feeling very christmassy at all			2
' i was really impressed with the way they addressed all the issues the first time around and the energy and resources that went into it so i 'm extremely surprised the towel 's been thrown in at this stage			1
' i feel appalling it is not the happy experience i really want it to be			2
i feel extremely sorry for everybody let down in the next nine days and also for the staff who worked on the front - line			1
i 'm hoping they will get their money back			0

it seemed a perfect opportunity			0
i really did feel ( organiser ) @entity110 and his team were the right people to do it			0
' in hindsight they absolutely were not experienced enough for this sort of event			0

' i have been looking on websites of everywhere i can think of but they are all booked up			0

the furore broke out after a barrage of complaints from parents on the first day over elves smoking , rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around last night the organisers said they had been ' left in the lurch ' and could not find a replacement financial back organisers have told ticket holders not to call the @entity9 , where the attraction was operating , as it has ' no affiliation ' to the @entity8 ' we are very sorry to have to break the news like this but we have explored all our options , and the situation leaves us with no alternative other than close the @entity8			1
' please do not contact @entity291 as they have no affiliation to the @entity8 and they will not be able to assist you in any way			1
