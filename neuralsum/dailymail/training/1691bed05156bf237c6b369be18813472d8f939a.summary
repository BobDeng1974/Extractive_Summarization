click here to see both strikers stats , goals and heat maps from @entity4 stop the clock , @entity5 has scored			1
but would @entity7 turn back time if he could ? it ’s certainly a question he could answer with a little more authority now than friday morning when , with a straight face , he claimed he was confident @entity5 would ultimately prove he was right to snub @entity11			1
of course , it came down to a straight choice between the two strikers in the summer of 2013 - an @entity16 playing in @entity17 and the big man who had just spent a good loan spell at the club			0
@entity7 went for @entity5 , backed him in his press conference last week and would have been oblivious to the @entity23 sniggering that accompanied @entity11 ’s first - half opener here			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity5 leaps in the air to celebrate his second goal in @entity29 's 3 - 1 victory over @entity30 @entity5 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) were both on the scoresheet but the @entity34 striker bagged a brace @entity29 ' @entity7 insists he was right to turn down a move for @entity11 in favour of the @entity39 striker click here to read @entity41 's full match report from @entity42 but @entity5 has always leant himself to a good narrative			1
perhaps it was poetic that he would respond in the manner he did , with two magnificent headers			0
there are no graces in those kind of goals and few mysteries			0
but surely there is beauty - and certainly great credit - in something so predictable being so hard to defend against ? @entity30 made it look impossible			1
his first goal , after 41 minutes , ended a stretch 797 minutes without a goal			0
another statistic showed he had not scored at @entity42 since march 2013			0
these numbers are always at the ready with @entity5 ; there ’s always a rod to beat him with			2
his second sent @entity29 third in the table			2
but what of the original question ? where would @entity29 be if @entity7 took a chance on the @entity16 , £ 3m less at £ 12m and so prolific at @entity71 ? perhaps @entity7 should have known better than to even enter the discussion on friday			1
@entity5 and @entity11 's general match statistics show the @entity34 striker 's greater potency in the air the @entity16 striker celebrates after scoring his seventh @entity79 goal of the season @entity11 's opening goal at @entity42 came from a @entity30 attack down the left wing - click here for more stats from @entity4 @entity30 team - mates congratulate @entity11 after his opening goal at @entity42 having already explained that it was a straight choice between signing @entity5 and @entity11 , he was asked if he believed the choice he made would ultimately be vindicated			1
‘ i think so , ’ he said			0
‘ hopefully , in the end , it will be an @entity5 that is not picking up injuries and starts getting back to what we know he can do			2
his first season in the @entity79 at @entity96 showed at that young age he was a massive goal - scoring threat against anyone			1
‘ he has done it before			0
because of the injuries he had that career has n’t blossomed as it should have done			0
if he gets a run without injuries , we are in for a player of his capabilities			0
’ @entity5 's heat map ( above ) showed he covered far more ground , especially in dangerous areas , than @entity11 ( below ) - click here for more stats from @entity4 @entity5 rises to plant a superb header beyond @entity114 to level the scores @entity5 's equaliser took some patient build - up play while his second ( below ) came directly from a corner - click here for more stats from @entity4 @entity5 's first goal came after right wing cross from @entity29 defender @entity123 ( 18 ) the @entity29 no 9 enjoys the relief of breaking his goal scoring duck this season sadly , it is rare these days for discussions surrounding @entity5 to move beyond talk of injuries and what might be			1
there are hopes and possibilities and fleeting moments - like his performance here and the brilliant comeback cameo against @entity140 on november 8 - when it is possible to wonder how much he will offer when he is fully fit			0
but so little of the dialogue concerns the here and now			0
and it is on those terms that a comparison to @entity11 is so hopelessly skewed in the @entity16 ’s favour , even when the immediacy of this result has faded			1
@entity7 could n’t possibly admit any regrets for fear of sabotaging himself , but one must wonder			2
the truth is that @entity11 has proven himself wonderfully effective			2
and where he really differs from @entity5 is that he is a player who has sustained a level of goal - scoring brilliance that @entity5 has not matched			1
he has 19 goals in the calendar year – more than anyone in the @entity79			2
he has also scored seven in his past nine @entity79 fixtures after 25 in all competitions in his debut campaign			2
@entity164 scored more goals , made more assists and created more chances than @entity11 @entity5 's second goal came from another towering header , this time from @entity171 's corner @entity5 's second goal came another header directly from a corner by @entity171 @entity5 is surrounded by team - mates after netting twice to send the @entity29 to third in the table whatever way you cut it , his goals have been a consistent factor in @entity30 ’s performances			1
not bad for a striker who cost an initial £ 12m , has rarely broken down injured and last month signed a new contract until 2018			0
more still , the contract extension is understood to have addressed the release clause that might have seen him leave for £ 19m in the summer , when @entity187 were most prominent among his admirers			0
and @entity5 ? he has now scored three goals in the time @entity11 has scored 33			1
on that scale , the winner is obvious			0
it is also fair to say @entity11 is more accomplished on the ground , even if it is hard to blame @entity5 for @entity29 's habit of going long when he is on the pitch			1
but , as always , there is hope that this young @entity200 talent will enjoy the kind of run of good health that has so far eluded him			0
with any luck , he can take the strides that @entity7 expects of him .			2

@entity29 defeated @entity30 3 - 1 in their @entity79 clash on *sunday*
@entity11 opened the scoring with his seventh league goal this season
@entity5 finally scored his first league goal to equalise in the first half
the former @entity96 striker then netted his second with another header
@entity7 passed up the chance to sign @entity11 in favour of @entity5
