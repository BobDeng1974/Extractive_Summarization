archaeologists have unearthed the remarkably well - preserved ruins of an ancient shopping centre in northern @entity3			1
the 2,700 - year - old portico was discovered in june on the site of the ancient city of @entity7 following an archaeological excavation			1
an expert told @entity10 that they had even managed to identify individual shops - with one having been confirmed as a bakery , another an olive oil shop and one is thought , but not yet confirmed , to be a chemist that once sold make - up and medicine			1
the remains of the 2,700 - year - old portico was discovered this summer on the site of the ancient city of @entity7 , following an archaeological excavation in northern @entity3 in ancient @entity3 , the portico - or ' stoa ' in @entity3 - was a long , open structure that often housed shops and delineated public squares from the city			1
@entity27 were common during the @entity29 period , from the 3rd to 1st century @entity30 , but earlier examples are extremely rare			0
this latest finding from @entity33 the oldest example to date from northern @entity3 and is totally unique			0
' we had no idea something so historically important would be lying here , ' @entity35 , professor at the @entity37 's @entity36 , who led the dig told @entity10			1
@entity35 , professor at the @entity37 's @entity36 , who led the dig , told @entity10 that this room was a shop that pressed and sold its own olive oil ' it is incredibly exciting and we believe there still so much more to find			1
' located on the edge of the @entity49 , the ancient city of @entity7 was the first @entity3 colony established in this area around the @entity52			1
at its peak , in the 5th century @entity30 , @entity53 was one of the richest cities in the region			0
since 1992 , professor @entity35 and dr @entity58 , an archaeologist with the @entity59 and @entity60 , have excavated the hill covering @entity62			0
it is thought that this room was a bakery because archaeologists found a grinding stone to produce flour ( top right of room ) as well as a small kiln to bake bread the portico could have resembled the @entity74 in @entity75 ( reconstruction that stands in @entity3 capital , pictured )			2
it was built between 159 @entity30 and 138 @entity30 and became the major commercial building or shopping centre in the @entity81 and was used for centuries acquisitions of land were made on behalf of the @entity3 government , but the excavators retain the rights over scientific research			1
the remains of the @entity90 are located on one of these sites , at the northern end of what was the city 's commercial district , 50 metres from the port area at the time			2
the @entity98 of @entity99 was built by @entity99 of @entity100 who reigned between 159 and138 @entity30 he built it as a gift to the @entity75 in appreciation of the time he spent in @entity75 studying under the philosopher @entity106			2
the building was an elaborate ' stoa ' or ' portico ' - a large two - storeyed double colonnade with rows of shops behind the colonnades			1
the building was made of local materials , marble for the facade and columns , and limestone for the walls			0
it is 116 metres - long and originally housed 42 shop			2
the @entity98 became the major commercial building or shopping centre in the @entity81 and was used for centuries , from its construction in around 150 b.c. until its destruction at the hands of the @entity129 in a.d. 267			0
archaelogical digs in june unearthed a roughly 40 metre - long portico			2
the open area once contained seven rooms , five of which have been excavated , each measuring 5 metres wide and 7.5 metres deep , with a 2.5 - metre high back wall			0
' each room was a shop and they sat @entity141 - much like how shops are arranged in modern malls , ' explained professor @entity35			1
the rooms exposed by the dig are only the west side of the portico , leaving archaeologists with another ' wing ' to explore once they have finished their current dig. the portico is unusual in that it was not architecturally uniform			2
since @entity53 was very prosperous , experts have long believed that the portico was commissioned and built by the city			1
if this were the case , an architect would have overseen the construction and there would be an architectural uniformity to the structure			0
there would have been no differences in the size of the stones used , and all the rooms would have been identical			0
however , the architectural remains indicate the exact opposite			0
the construction techniques and the stones used are different from one room to another , hinting that several masons were used for each room			0
' this indicates that the shop owners themselves were probably responsible for building the rooms , that " private enterprise " and not the city was the source of this stoa , ' professor @entity35 , who specialises of the @entity3 archaic period , between the 7th and 6th centuries @entity30 , told @entity10			1
' we have confirmed one of the shops as a bakery - we found a flour grinding stone as well as a kiln inside to bake			2
another was an olive oil shop as it still had the olive press required to produce the product			1
' archaeologists also unearthed this vessel called a ' krater ' which was often used to mix water and wine archaeologists found a ' very , very small ' stone in another shop that may have been used as a pestle and mortar			0
this , they believe , could indicate that the shop was a chemist that pulverised its own ingredients to made medicine and make - up for visiting customers			1
in the @entity212 , northern @entity3 was very prosperous			0
the valley of the @entity52 , whose mouth is located less than three km from @entity62 , was rich in gold and silver mines			0
with its ports and nearby mines , @entity53 was a strategic location for trade in precious metals			0
experts remain baffled by this finding however - they had no idea what it may have been used for , although the small holes indicate it once hung up on a wall but its prosperity declined rapidly from the mid- 5th century @entity30 , when the @entity75 founded the nearby city of @entity234			2
in 357 @entity30 , @entity235 conquered the whole region and deported the inhabitants from @entity62 to @entity234 , the new seat of the king of @entity240			0
deserted and untouched by further urban development , @entity53 has remained frozen in time , which is why its buildings are in such relatively pristeen condition			0
the portico itself has not yet been fully excavated , and according to the results of a three - metre deep geophysical survey , the structure appears to continue , and more discoveries thus await the archaeologists			2
' we hope to excavate what we hope is the east side of the portico next year and it could unearth many more shops and insights into daily life in the once prosperous city			1
i 'm very excited , ' professor @entity35 told @entity10 .			1

the ruins were discovered on the site of the ancient city of @entity7
expert told @entity10 that units are so well - preserved that individual shops can be identified - *including* outlet that made and sold own olive oil
*non-uniform* design indicates that each owner *designed* and built his shop
said nothing like this had ever been discovered and that they expect to find many more shops when they excavate the east side of the portico next year
