the first came when he and a group of friends decided to go for a swim in the sea during a trip to @entity34			0
mr @entity1 did not realise the water was only 3ft deep and dived off a high pier – straight on to a bed of sharp rocks			1
incredibly , he survived the impact , but shattered the fifth vertebrae in his spine which caused him to have a heart attack as his lungs filled with water			2
his life had to be saved four times within the next 30 minutes by first - aiders on the scene and paramedics who took him to hospital			2
he awoke from a five - week coma and spent months recovering			2
but his brushes with death were far from over			2
during his time in hospital he contracted life - threatening bouts of @entity18 and pneumonia			1
again he survived and , defying doctors ’ initial expectations that he would never walk or talk again , he was back on his feet within months			2
however , not long after his release from hospital , he was given the devastating news that he had testicular cancer			1

he said : ‘ there is no doubt i was saved by people who pulled me from the water and who knew exactly what to do			0
i went into cardiac arrest numerous times that morning			0
i owe so much to all who tended to me			0
’ he was moved to the @entity95 hospital in @entity96 where his family and hairdresser girlfriend @entity97 , 20 , had to make the decision to go ahead with a risky spinal operation while he was in a coma			1
‘ i woke up and i was completely paralysed			0
i could only see black - and - white shapes and could only communicate by blinking and sticking my tongue out			0
my family was told it was unlikely i would speak again and i probably would spend my life in a wheelchair controlled by my chin			0
’ just five months after the accident he took his first steps			0
however , during his time recovering at a care home , he was given the next batch of devastating news after doctors found a tumour			1
he said : ‘ the realisation it was possible that i would be paralysed for the rest of my life had been very real			0

@entity1 first escaped death in june 2011 when he dived into rocks
the trauma triggered *multiple* heart attacks , a coma and a broken neck

he then found a lump and doctors *diagnosed* him with testicular cancer
but has now fully recovered and describes himself as ' luckiest unlucky man in @entity24 '
