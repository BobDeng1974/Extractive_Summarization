@entity43 , @entity8 ’s energy spokesman , said : ‘ with warnings of more price rises this winter , it ’s clearer than ever that @entity3 needs to break the dominance of the energy giants and protect the public from being ripped off			1
’ the party plans to abolish @entity21 and create a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall			1
the party would also require the energy companies to pool the power they generate and to make it available to any retailer , to open up the market and make it more transparent			1

under fire : labour minister @entity43 says the figures show the coalition has not done enough to crack down on profiteering energy companies small businesses would only be able to be back - billed for one year , and not subjected to six years of crippling back - billing , which at the moment can run into tens of thousands of pounds			1
