a vandalised home covered with red spray paint and smashed windows sits vacant in an east side neighborhood of @entity4			0
the street used to be a busy hub of families , but its occupants have fled their homes leaving whole blocks empty and dark			0
the city 's budget problems have deepened to such an extent that it could run out of cash in a matter of weeks or months and ultimately be forced into what would be the largest - ever chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing in the @entity18			1
ghost town : a vacant and blighted home , covered with red spray paint , sits alone in an east side neighborhood once full of homes in @entity4 the story of @entity4 's decline is decades old - its tax revenue and population have shrunk and labor costs have remained out of unfeasible signs of decline are everywhere in @entity4 - crime is rising with the murder rate of one per 1,719 people last year , more than 11 times the rate in @entity35			1
the jobless rate is above 18 percent , more than twice rate for the country as a whole			1
at the @entity41 earlier this month , luxury was in the air			0
pricey new @entity43 and @entity44 glittered - including a @entity45 with a $ 132,000 price tag ; @entity18 cabinet secretaries and dignitaries rubbed shoulders ; and many of the well - heeled attendees ponied up for a $ 300 - a - ticket black - tie charity ball			1
cuts : spray paint on the front of a vacant and blighted home says the gas and water utilities have been turned off in the east side neighborhood running out : the city 's budget problems have deepened to such an extent that it could run out of cash in a matter of weeks or months but in a city that is slowly dying , the glitz did n't extend much beyond the @entity68 exhibition hall			1
@entity69 ( @entity70 ) and @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , which along with @entity73 ( @entity74 ) gave the @entity4 its identity , survived near - death experiences after filing for bankruptcy during the financial crisis			1
now , @entity4 itself is edging closer to a similar precipice , only unlike the automakers , its chances of getting a federal bailout are almost nonexistent			0
the story of @entity4 's decline is decades old : its tax revenue and population have shrunk and labor costs have remained out of sync			2
bankrupt : @entity4 could ultimately be forced into what would be the largest - ever chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing in the @entity18 frustrated by the lack of concrete progress , @entity94 governor @entity93 , a @entity95 , last month appointed a team to scour the city 's books			1
the audit could result in a state takeover of @entity4 's finances through the appointment of an emergency financial manager			2
such a manager , who would seize control of the city 's checkbook , could then propose federal bankruptcy court as the best option			1
@entity93 , who has called the situation ' a crisis in terms of financial affairs , ' said the team would deliver its report in february			0
investigation : frustrated by the lack of concrete progress , @entity94 governor @entity93 , a @entity95 , last month appointed a team to scour the city 's books ' @entity4 is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy after the @entity124 has failed to make the necessary cuts to deal with having a smaller population , ' said @entity127 , chairman of the @entity95 majority caucus in the @entity129			1
@entity127 , who has indicated he does not favor a bankruptcy , said he would like to see an emergency manager installed to fix the city 's problems			1
if that failed , there would be a case for finding a way to shrink the @entity4 municipal area , he argued			2
@entity4 's population is now just over 700,000 - down 30 percent since 1990 - but the city still has to provide services to an area encompassing more land than @entity144 , @entity145 and the borough of @entity147			2
while @entity150 mayor @entity149 and the @entity151 have moved to reduce spending and initiate some reforms to stave off a takeover , including layoffs and wage and benefit cuts , the progress may not be enough for @entity94 officials and lawmakers			0
spotlight : president @entity161 speaks about the economy at the @entity164 engine plant in december in the booming @entity166 era , @entity4 was @entity18 's fifth - largest city			1
today , it ranks 18th			0
in addition to a sharp population decline , it suffers from high unemployment related to a loss of businesses , a flood of home foreclosures and a cut in state funding			0
that has led to shriveling revenue , leaving the city unable to afford a workforce of more than 10,000 and the surging health and pension costs that go with them and with its retirees			2
issues : mayor @entity149 talks about the city 's crime problem during a press conference at the @entity192 building in @entity4 as a result , credit ratings on @entity4 's approximately $ 8.2 billion of outstanding debt have sunk deeper into junk territory			1
the city 's labor costs , including health care and pensions , are shrinking in absolute terms but rising as a share of the budget			1
they are slated to drop to $ 968 million , or nearly 49.5 percent of the operating budget , in the fiscal year ending june 30 versus $ 1.14 billion , or 45.5 percent , a year earlier			0
a bankruptcy would be messy			0
the interests of creditors would likely collide with those of labor unions wanting to protect workers ' benefits , said @entity214 , a @entity215 economist who has written papers on municipal bankruptcy and on the state 's emergency manager laws			1
' it is going to require the players - the @entity124 , the mayor , the state - to be on the same page			0
if you go into bankruptcy with a lot of conflict and dissent , it 's going to cost more , ' said @entity214			2
it could also be racially explosive			0
@entity4 has the largest percentage of black people of any @entity18 city , with 83 percent of the population identifying themselves as @entity236 , black or @entity237 , according to the 2010 @entity18 census			1
most of @entity94 's state government , including the governor 's office , is run by white @entity95			2
detroit council member @entity243 , who along with two other members of the city 's all - black @entity124 has been resisting reform measures , said she is still hopeful of a federal bailout or an injection of state money that she claims the city is owed			1
changing times : in the booming @entity166 era , @entity4 was @entity18 's fifth - largest city heyday : despite previous glory ears the city now suffers from high unemployment related to a loss of businesses , a flood of home foreclosures and a cut in state funding mayor @entity149 would not comment for this story			1
the automakers have little to say publicly about the crisis			0
most of their operations in @entity94 are now outside @entity4 , and getting any top executive to even discuss the possibility of a city bankruptcy was almost impossible at the auto show			2
' i do n't want to get into the politics , ' said @entity69 ceo @entity277 , while @entity71 ceo @entity278 said : ' i do n't see what the consequences would be for us			0
' one of the city 's biggest challenges is its complex set of labor agreements with a whopping 48 bargaining units that represent most of the city 's workforce			1
trip through time : the @entity73 factory at @entity291 in @entity94 thriving business : a gathering of workers in the yard of the @entity73 factories between the two wars control : station of the electric commands regulating the temperature of ovens at the @entity73 car factory in @entity4 @entity303 , a bankruptcy attorney at @entity94 - based @entity304 , said a chapter 9 bankruptcy could help the city throw out its collective bargaining agreements with unions			2
costs would have to be tackled since @entity4 can not just jack up taxes to reduce the cumulative budget deficit , which grew to $ 326.6 million in fiscal 2012 from $ 196.6 million in fiscal 2011			0
the state would likely resist tax increases , and they might only make matters worse anyway			0
' if taxes go up any further it would exacerbate the flight out of the city , ' @entity303 said			0
but for some of those who have seen @entity4 struggle for years , bankruptcy is starting to look like the least awful option - even though it will be painful			2
' i think ... off and on , that it would n't be a bad idea , ' said former @entity73 chief financial officer @entity327 , now the president of @entity4 's @entity328			0
' let 's clean this out once and for all			0

the city 's budget problems have deepened to such an extent that it could run out of cash in a matter of weeks
could be forced into what would be the largest - ever municipal bankruptcy filing in the @entity18
crime rate is rising and jobless rate twice figure for the country as a whole
