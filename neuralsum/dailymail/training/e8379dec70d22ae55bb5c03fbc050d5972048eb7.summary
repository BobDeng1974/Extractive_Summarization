archaeologists have uncovered cave art providing evidence that hunter - gatherer children may have attended a form of prehistoric pre-school			2
researchers have revealed that 13,000 years ago , prehistoric children created art in caves with the help of their parents			1
a conference on the @entity13 at @entity14 , starting today , will reveal the latest research into art made by children as young as three in one of the most famous prehistoric decorated caves in @entity20			1
archaelogists found evidence of thousands of lines - a simple form of art or decoration known as finger flutings - made by people running their hands down the soft surfaces of the walls and roofs of the many galleries and passages that make up the complex stunning drawings of mammoths , rhinoceros and horses have been found within the five - mile ' @entity41 ' cave system in @entity42			1
experts recently developed a method of identifying the age and gender of those behind the drawings , with one of the most prolific artists being a prehistoric girl aged five			1
some of the drawings by children were found high up on walls , meaning they could have been helped up there under the watchful eye of an adult			1

archaeologist @entity69 said : ' @entity70 made by children appear in every chamber throughout the caves even those that are a good 45 minutes ' walk from the entrance - so far , we have n't found anywhere that adults fluted without children			0
' some of the children 's flutings are high up on the walls and on the ceilings , so they must have been held up to make them or have been sitting on someone 's shoulders			1
archaeologist @entity69 said : ' we do n't know why people made them			0
we can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals , for training of some kind , or simply something to do on a rainy day ' some of the drawings by children were found high up on walls , meaning they could have been helped up there under the watchful eye of an adult			1
cave woman : archaeologist @entity69 ' we have found marks by children aged between three and seven - years - old - and we have been able to identify four individual children by matching up their marks			1
' the most prolific of the children who made flutings was aged around five - and we are almost certain the child in question was a girl			2
' interestingly , of the four children we know at least two are girls			0
' one cavern is so rich in flutings made by children that it suggests it was a special space for them , but whether for play or ritual is impossible to tell			0
' archaeologists first realised that children had produced some of the finger flutings back in 2006			0
@entity123 carried out earlier this year by @entity69 and @entity124 of @entity125 , @entity126 , shows just how young they were			0
though impossible to date accurately , the images found deep inside the @entity42 caves - a network created by river systems - are likely to be at least 13,000 years old			1
the flutings also raise questions over age identity - whether children were seen as we are now - and apparent gender equality			2
finger fluting also appears in caves in @entity20 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			0

' in addition to the simple meandering lines , there are flutings of animals and shapes that appear to be very crude outlines of faces , almost cartoon - like in appearance			0
