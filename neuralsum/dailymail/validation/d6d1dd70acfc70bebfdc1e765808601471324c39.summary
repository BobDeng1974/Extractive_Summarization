he was one of the @entity2 's most controversial fashion stars , a man whose flamboyant public image concealed a private life blighted by depression and battles with drink and drugs			1
now a retrospective of @entity11 's work is to go on display at @entity14 's @entity13 , with pieces taken from his ground - breaking 1992 @entity17 collection shown alongside his last			1
@entity20 , which opens next month but had a preview for @entity23 stars this evening , includes pieces from the unfinished 2010 collection as well as new pieces lent by @entity11 's friends , among them stylist @entity29			1
the son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher , the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in @entity56 , south @entity14 , where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters			0
after leaving school at 16 with a single @entity62 in art , the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at @entity65 tailors @entity66 , before a stint at theatrical costumiers , @entity69 and @entity70			0
both would have huge influence on his later career			0
@entity11 's big break came following a spell in @entity76 working for @entity77			1
on his return to @entity14 , he applied to @entity79 for work as a pattern cutter			0
impressed by his portfolio , @entity83 , the head of the master 's course , persuaded him to enrol as a student instead			0
his faith in @entity11 paid off			2
the designer 's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by @entity92			2
talented : @entity11 , pictured left during his s / @entity94 show and , right , backstage with a model , was one of the @entity2 's most talented designers striking : his pieces were adored by fashion press and fashion - buying public alike hard to walk in : his shoes were notoriously elaborate and hard to walk in , as several models discovered while on the catwalk finishing touches : a curator works on an exhibit ( left ) , while right , one of the structured gowns for which @entity11 became famous last pieces : these designs are taken from @entity11 's s / @entity111 collection which was inspired by sea creatures from there , @entity11 went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation , designing @entity118 's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous ' bumsters ' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans			1
the same year , he was appointed creative director at @entity123 , replacing fellow @entity125 @entity124 , and relocated to @entity126			0
but despite his success , @entity11 never forgot his @entity14 roots , often speaking of his love for the @entity2 capital			1
indeed , he once spoke of how inspiring he found the @entity13 itself , saying : ' the collections at the @entity13 never fail to intrigue and inspire me			2
the nation is privileged to have access to such a resource ... it 's the sort of place i 'd like to be shut in overnight			0
' the museum repaid the compliment , first by including the designer 's work in @entity143 : 50 years of @entity144 in 1997 , and then again in its fashion in motion series			1
but it is the new @entity20 retrospective that will be the largest retrospective of @entity11 's work hosted by the museum , with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show			1
enfant terrible : one of @entity11 's more shocking stunts involved spraying model @entity154 with paint during his s / @entity158 show striking : a @entity13 assistant poses next to a dress taken from @entity11 's @entity161 who lived in @entity163 / w 2008 collection magnificent : as with his shoes , the headgear shown on the catwalk by @entity11 was usually difficult to wear changing times : @entity11 's sea creature inspired s / @entity111 collection ( left ) and a dress from his a / @entity173 of @entity175 collection among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection , as well as some of his a / @entity182 designs - the last the designer would ever create			1
his final collection was never completed , with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in @entity126 a month after he died			2
but while @entity11 might be gone , his brand lives on and , in the capable hands of his former assistant @entity188 , continues to go from strength to strength			1
' @entity192 was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries , challenged and inspired , ' she explains			0
' he believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless			0
@entity20 is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time			0
' ' i am thrilled to announce that the @entity13 will bring this wonderful exhibition to @entity14 to celebrate the extraordinary creative talent of one of the most innovative designers of recent times , ' adds @entity13 director @entity209			2
' @entity11 was brought up in @entity14 , studied here and based his globally successful @entity11 fashion brand here â€“ by staging the exhibition at the @entity13 it feels like we are bringing his work home			1
' dramatic : @entity11 was famous for producing pieces that erred on the side of gothic such as these three dresses spectacular : @entity222 and bold blooms were also recurring motifs , as these striking gowns make plain setting the scene : @entity20 opens at the @entity13 next month , with tickets due to go on sale on the 14th march the stars turned out in force for the party the @entity13 held this evening to celebrate the arrival of the exhibition			1
supermodels including @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 all showed up at the event in dresses by the late designer			0
a-list names from the world of acting also showed up to view the designs , including @entity245 and @entity246 , while @entity118 and @entity247 put in an appearance too			0
princess @entity249 flew the flag for the @entity2 royals , turning heads as she arrived in a black tuxedo - style dress that was split to the thigh			1
@entity256 and @entity235 also attended the exhibition @entity118 and @entity247 were also invited to the event custom @entity259 ' 15 shop @entity247 at @entity261 visit site there 's no denying that @entity247 is now officially part of the fashion elite			2
her catwalk collections are met with as much respect as the long - established labels , as well as becoming a style icon herself			0
attending the opening night of the ' @entity11 : @entity20 ' exhibition , @entity247 demonstrated both of our points by looking stunning in a dress from her own brand			1
the strapless design gave it a chic look , but the bold cut - out features provided an edgy fashion - forward streak to the look			2
naturally , when you 're the head of a brand getting a custom made frock is not a problem , explaining why you can only spot a slightly shorter skirt version of this same cut - out design on the recent @entity292 / @entity259 catwalk			0
you might not be able to get our hands on this exact custom made dress , but not only can you click right to shop the current @entity299 range at @entity261 , but you can also get inspired by @entity247 's look with our edit of strapless dresses below			0
