by @entity0 published : 01:53 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 03:12 est , 22 january 2013 it has been revealed the @entity3 firm which makes the lithium ion batteries for the troubled @entity5 also has a contract to supply batteries to the @entity8			1
@entity9 , which has its headquarters in @entity11 is the focus of an investigation by authorities in @entity3 and the @entity15 into the cause of a fire on a @entity19 plane at @entity20 in @entity21 earlier this month and an emergency landing by an @entity24 jet last week			1
these issues caused the @entity26 to issue a rare emergency airworthiness directive , which led to the worldwide grounding of all 50 active @entity29 that @entity5 has delivered so far			0
photo taken from a @entity32 helicopter shows the headquarters building of @entity9 in @entity11 's @entity34 yesterday on the day investigators arrived for their second visit however , the lithium batteries that @entity9 supplies for the @entity8 are not the same as the one it makes for the @entity5 , @entity38 spokesperson @entity37 said to @entity41			1
@entity37 also said that @entity38 will not reconsider its contract with the @entity3 firm until after the @entity26 investigation is complete			1
this comes as the @entity3 transport ministry said that it will conduct a second probe into @entity9 and also add @entity47 , a @entity48 supplier to their investigation into the faults which have grounded the fleet			1
officials spent the day at @entity9 's offices on tuesday and said that a team is also being dispatched to the @entity48 to speak to the maker of a valve actuator for the 787			1
the lithium batteries that @entity9 supplies for the @entity8 are not the same as the one it makes for the @entity5 , @entity38 spokesperson @entity37 said to @entity41			1
a spokesman ( center ) for @entity9 meets the press outside the company 's headquarters in @entity11 's @entity34 yesterday because of the ongoing investigation , @entity5 said last week that it will deliver no more of their multi-billion dollar dreamliner aircraft until the lithium - ion batteries are deemed safe			1
@entity9 is fully cooperating with the authorities , @entity9 spokesman @entity68 said			2
' we â€™re checking parts and the manufacturing process to ensure work was carried out appropriately , ' said @entity74			0
a spokesman for @entity9 , which makes batteries for the 787 , said the company was fully cooperating with the investigation , and its engineers were working with the officials from the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) and @entity3 's @entity81 ( @entity82 ) at the company 's compound in @entity11 , where it makes airplane batteries			1
@entity82 official @entity87 told reporters the investigating team had been briefed by @entity9 and had toured the plant , looking at battery design , production and quality			0
the @entity3 investigation at the plant will continue on tuesday on a more detailed level , including tracking battery batch numbers and production dates , he said			2
authorities around the world last week grounded the new lightweight dreamliner , and @entity5 halted deliveries after a problem with a lithium - ion battery prompted an @entity24 787 into the emergency landing at @entity106 during a domestic flight			1
culprit : the @entity5 's lithium battery can self heat as a result of temperature and pressure changes , which may have caused this battery fire on a @entity5 at @entity20 , @entity21 on january 7 earlier this month , a similar battery caught fire in a @entity19 ' 787 parked at @entity20			1
@entity15 safety investigators on sunday ruled out excess voltage as the cause of the @entity21 battery fire on january 7 , and said they were expanding their probe to look at the battery 's charger and the jet 's auxiliary power unit			2
the battery is one part of the 787 's complex electrical system , built by @entity130 company @entity129 ' results have shown the battery was abnormal in both the @entity21 and @entity134 ( incidents )			0
they were the most damaged , ' @entity74 , a senior safety official at the @entity82 , told reporters ahead of the on - site visit to @entity9			0
' we will look into if the work that took place , from design to manufacturing , was appropriate			0
' shares in @entity9 , valued at close to $ 1.5 billion , rose 1 percent on monday , having dropped nearly 10 percent since the @entity21 fire			0
both @entity3 and the @entity15 have opened investigations into the plane after a series of incidents have raised safety concerns the burned insides of the @entity24 battery showed it received voltage in excess of its design limits			1
however , a battery that caught fire in a @entity19 @entity5 in @entity21 earlier this month was found not to have been overcharged			2
@entity15 government investigators said there could still be problems with wiring or other charging components			0
in @entity165 , @entity15 transportation secretary @entity164 said the 787 , which has a list price of $ 207 million , would not fly until regulators were " 1,000 percent sure " it was safe			2
@entity3 is the biggest market so far for the 787 , with @entity24 and @entity19 operating 24 of the 290 - seat wide - bodied planes			2
out of service : one of @entity172 six 787s sits on the tarmac at @entity174 in @entity175 touchdown : a @entity177 is seen coming in to land at the @entity178 in july last year			0
the aircraft has been plagued with safety issues since entering commercial service in 2011 @entity5 has orders for almost 850 of the planes , which have the most complex electrical systems of any planes on the market			0
it remains unclear if the investigations will cause other airlines -- and military aircraft builder -- to rethink their plans to use lithium - ion batteries , which are lighter and more powerful than conventional batteries			0
@entity193 plans to use similar batteries on its rival to the 787 , the @entity196 , which is due to make its maiden test flight in the middle of this year .			0

@entity3 firm @entity9 provides the lithium batteries for the troubled @entity5 aircraft
it also has a contract with @entity38 to supply cells to the @entity8
it is the focus of an investigation by @entity15 and @entity3 authorities into the cause of two fires *aboard* @entity3 787 @entity5 's earlier this month
