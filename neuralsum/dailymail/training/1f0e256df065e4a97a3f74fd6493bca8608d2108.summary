by @entity0 the @entity1 waded into yet another race row yesterday after @entity4 blacked - up for his latest comedy sketch show and poked fun at a @entity8 girl in a burka			1
the comedian and his comedy partner @entity11 were accused of being ‘ crass and tasteless ’ yesterday for apparently mocking ethnic minorities			1
their new show – @entity15 : the @entity16 - will be shown later this month as part of @entity19 ’s celebration of its 50th birthday			1
in one risqué sketch , @entity21 makes fun of black @entity25 singer @entity24 by covering his face in dark make - up			1
he is one of a series of real - life personalities , including @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity21 lampoons as part of a running gag about famous people called @entity15 or @entity37			1
in another bizarre scene likely to outrage some viewers , the comedians turn a young @entity8 girl covered in a burqa into the butt of their humour			1
for no apparent reason , she is introduced into a spoof of @entity58 crime drama the killing along - side a young boy dressed in a costume of animated penguin @entity62			0
the implication seems to be that her burqa makes the @entity8 girl look like a penguin			1
the pair are seen waddling through a tower block before the boy shoots a woman in the head at point blank range			0
coming just weeks after @entity76 presenter @entity75 was forced to apologise for apparently mumbling the n - word during an outtake , the sketches are likely to further inflame tensions over what the @entity1 puts on air			2
the story of the twos , which will be shown at 9pm on sunday may 25 , is expected to be watched by millions of families			0
comedy partners @entity11 , left , and @entity4 , right , have created their new show @entity15 : the story of @entity83 as part of @entity19 's 50th anniversary celebrations asked to justify his decision to include a young girl in a burqa at a preview screening this month , @entity21 , 52 , said he wanted to have a ‘ little muslim ’ in the show			1
he said : ‘ i thought we had to have a @entity8 person in it because they always have @entity8			0
all the @entity104 programmes , they always have a @entity8			0
why is there a @entity8 in them ? ’ @entity4 joked that his burqa - wearing character should have been called ‘ red herring ’ because that is the role that @entity8 characters play in the foreign thrillers			2
last night , media standards campaigner @entity112 , of the group @entity114 , said @entity21 risked stoking ethnic tensions with his comedy			2
she said : ‘ is @entity4 just going out of his way to be controversial by using a young girl dressed in a burqa meeting a young boy dressed in a @entity62 penguin costume for his sketch ? ‘ poking fun at young @entity8 , who look no more than children , is in very poor taste , especially when some young @entity8 women are complaining of being harassed and even attacked for wearing the burqa			1
‘ to then shoot a woman in the head is completely inappropriate			0
@entity4 is no longer funny and the @entity1 has lost the plot			0
’ @entity1 presenter @entity75 was recently embroiled in a race row after appearing to say the n - word during unaired footage it is not the first time @entity4 has been caught up in a race row because of his edgy comedy			1
in 2008 , he provoked fury in the @entity140 with a sketch in which he played a man who tries to get his ‘ pet northerner ’ to mate with his @entity145 housemaid			0
a senior @entity145 congresswoman demanded the @entity1 apologise over the ‘ revolting ’ sketch , which she said depicted @entity140 as ’ submissive sex objects ’			2
the country ’s ambassador to the @entity151 said it was ‘ gutter humour ’			0
the same year , @entity4 revealed he was forced to drop a planned character of a sex - crazed @entity8 hoodie because producers were afraid of provoking a barrage of complaints			2
he was also warned not to play another new character , paedophile catholic priest @entity159 , for the same reason			0
@entity4 said at the time : ‘ i was told , “ do n’t even go there ”			0
’ the latest controversy comes after @entity75 was embroiled in a racism row for apparently mumbling the word n * * * * * in unaired footage			0
and last week , the @entity1 sacked @entity168 dj @entity167 , 67 , for broadcasting a song con - taining the words : ‘ he ’s been tanning n * * * * * * out in @entity171 , now he ’s coming to do the same to you ’			2
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ @entity4 and @entity11 have a well - established brand of humour which is well known to @entity19 audiences			1
in history of the @entity83 a wide range of people , history and trends across @entity1 2 ’s 50 year history are parodied without any intention to offend			1
‘ in the ‘ @entity62 ’ sketch no group of people are being satirised , but the genre of @entity187 is very much lampooned			0
