fury : @entity1 went to lengths to praise the protesters ' ' peaceful ' behaviour despite such chants as , ' what do we want ? dead cops ! when do we want it ? now ! ' @entity12 's mayor , @entity1 , has been branded a ' total nicompoop ' after he used the word ' allegedly ' to describe a mob assault by protesters on two police lieutenants			1
@entity19 top brass are furious at @entity1 's implication that the beating may not have happened , claiming no such skepticism is ever shown when officers are accused of violence against civilians			1
he made the remarks after the two officers were set upon by protesters during a demonstration on @entity29 against recent police killings , including the ' chokehold ' death of @entity33 in july			1
he went to lengths to praise the protesters ' ' peaceful ' behaviour despite such chants as , ' what do we want ? dead cops ! when do we want it ? now ! ' he went on to dismiss the assault as ' an incident ... in which a small group of protesters allegedly assaulted some members of the @entity19 , ' the @entity43 reported			1
' when cops are the accused , the word ' alleged ' never enters into the discussion , ' @entity50 , president of the @entity19 @entity51 , told the paper			1
@entity56 of the @entity57 , called @entity1 a ' total nincompoop ' for his handling of the affair , adding : ' his actions are contributing to the injuries that are being received by the @entity19			1
' maybe he should be out there to take the broken nose for the lieutenant			0
ask him if he 'd be willing to stand out there and take the punches for the cops			2
' the incident began when the two officers arrested a @entity72 professor , @entity71 , 29 , as he tried to pour a rubbish bin onto other cops from a pedestrian overpass			1
they were punched and kicked in the heads , leaving them needing instant medical attention			1
ironically , the officers were from the department 's @entity80 and were only present at the protest to ensure that demonstrators ' civil rights were respected by police			1
it is the latest controversy in a long - running stand off between @entity12 and police following a spate of deaths in custody			2
thousands of demonstrators marched in @entity141 , @entity12 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 on saturday to protest against killings of unarmed black men by police officers			1
organizers said the marches were among the largest in a recent wave of protests against the deaths that have cast a global spotlight on race relations in the @entity155			2
the rallies were mainly peaceful , though police in @entity142 said they arrested 23 people who tried to block a highway			1
officers in @entity144 , @entity161 said they detained about 45 people for vandalism , failure to disperse , resisting arrest and other charges after thousands took to the streets			2
decisions by grand juries to return no indictments against the officers involved in the deaths of @entity174 in @entity175 and @entity33 in @entity12 have put police treatment of minorities back on the national agenda			2
' we 're going to keep the light on @entity181 ... on all of the victims			0
the only way you make roaches run is to keep the light on , ' said civil rights leader the rev. @entity187 , whose @entity188 organized the @entity141 rally			0
marchers , including many parents with children , chanted ' no justice , no peace , no racist police ' and ' hands up , do n't shoot			2
' protesters carried signs that said ' all men are created equal ' and ' @entity199 lives matter			0
' relatives of @entity33 and @entity202 , who were killed by @entity12 police , @entity174 and @entity204 , slain by a @entity206 neighborhood watchman in 2012 , all took part in the @entity141 rally then , last week , a grand jury in @entity136 sparked global outrage after it refused to indict @entity210 over the chokehold that killed the father - of - six			0
the confrontation began when @entity210 arrested him for illegally selling cigarettes on the street			0
in the ensuing tussle , the officer put @entity33 in the controversial headlock moments before @entity33 was heard saying : ' i ca n't breathe			0
' they turned out to be the last words he ever spoke			0
he passed out and later died in hospital			0
his final words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in @entity12 and other cities after @entity210 escaped indictment			0
a @entity1 spokesman refused to comment on why the mayor chose to include the word ' allegedly ' while describing the @entity29 attack			1
' last night , the mayor could not have been more clear that violence in protests will not be tolerated and that our police should be commended for the professionalism and service they have displayed throughout these marches , ' spokesman @entity237 said			0
the fallout could n't come at a worse time for @entity1 , whose relationship with the @entity19 has soured in recent months			1
it comes two days after the @entity123 told @entity1 to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty for his ' consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve			1
' the union posted a form on its website that members could download and sign , barring the mayor and city council speaker @entity265 from their service			0
it read : ' i , as a @entity12 police officer , request that mayor @entity1 and city council speaker @entity265 refrain from attending my funeral services in the event that i am killed in the line of duty , ' the waiver states			0
' due to mayor @entity1 and speaker @entity276 's consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve , i believe that their attendance at the funeral of a fallen @entity12 police officer is an insult to that officer 's memory and sacrifice			2
' in a joint statement , @entity1 and @entity276 described the snub as ' deeply disappointing ' .			0

he was discussing attack on 2 officers during protest on @entity29
they were beaten while arresting @entity72 professor hurling garbage at cops
they were punched and kicked in the heads leaving them in hospital
@entity122 praised ' peaceful ' protesters dismissing attack as ' an incident '
*footage* showed protesters chanting ' what do we want ? dead cops ! '
it happened on @entity29 during protest over recent police killings
@entity19 @entity51 say ' allegedly ' never used when cops accused of assaulting civilians
