@entity0 has ruled out the possibility of @entity2 featuring against @entity3 on wednesday despite knowing his side are in desperate need of the @entity7 ace			1
@entity2 and new @entity3 striker @entity8 have just helped @entity7 win the @entity9			2
‘ we do n’t want both of them to come back so quickly because it is impossible for them to play on wednesday ( against @entity3 ) , ' said @entity0			0
' after that we have 10 days without a game so they have time to come back			0
in fact , @entity21 have not won a @entity25 match without @entity2 since their 3 - 1 victory against @entity46 in march 2014			2
city have managed to claim important @entity48 wins against @entity49 and @entity50 without @entity2 , but their talisman seems to be an integral component when it comes to competing in the @entity25			0
@entity8 ( centre ) will also miss his new side 's @entity25 clash against @entity3 @entity25 leaders @entity27 have capitalised on @entity2 's absence by racing into a seven - point lead @entity21 managed to go on an 11 - match unbeaten run in the @entity25 before @entity2 jetted out to @entity62			1
the 31 - year - old missed just one of those 11 games as he was rested for the visit of @entity67 on december 28			0
@entity0 's side have drawn with @entity32 , @entity21 and @entity35 , lost to @entity33 and were knocked out of the @entity28 by @entity69 side @entity34 in january			0
the @entity25 champions were level on points with @entity27 after 20 games before @entity2 's departure , four games later and they are now seven points behind @entity77 's side			1
throwing the recently - crowned @entity9 champion @entity2 and his team - mate @entity8 straight back into the fold would be a major gamble , but it may just be a risk worth taking given @entity3 's reliance on the former @entity85 star .			1

@entity21 have lost ground on @entity27 in @entity2 's absence
city were level on points with the league leaders before his departure
the @entity25 champions are now seven points behind the @entity97
@entity0 has *refused* to play @entity2 or @entity8 against @entity3
