@entity1 defector @entity0 is on course to romp home as @entity5 's first member of parliament , a new poll suggested last night			1
a survey of more than 1,000 voters in the @entity10 constituency of @entity11 put support for mr @entity0 - who quit as its conservative mp last week to stand for @entity5 - on 56 percentage points , well ahead of the @entity15 on 24 points			1
@entity17 is on 16 points while the @entity19 are on a miserable two percentage points , according to the poll commissioned by former @entity1 deputy chairman @entity22			2
@entity0 ( right ) sent shock waves through @entity24 last week by announcing he was joining @entity5 lord @entity22 said : ' even allowing for some movement in vote shares as the campaign unfolds , the likely outcome is clear			1
' what happens to the seat at the general election seven months later is rather less settled			0
as things stand , the indication is that @entity0 could hold the seat , but perhaps with a reduced majority			1
' the @entity1 have decided to get the contest over with as quickly as possible - announcing yesterday that it will take place on october 9 , which is @entity38 's 48th birthday			1
mr @entity0 , speaking in detail about his decision to defect , said the final straw came when he attended the @entity43 in @entity44 , an annual meeting of senior @entity47 and @entity48 policymakers , where he heard senior @entity50 officials pouring scorn on mr @entity38 's plan to claw back powers from @entity54			1
' i was shocked , i thought the government was serious about change			0
and i sat in rooms listening to some very senior people , who unlike me are not democratically accountable , who clearly decide things , and who were just contemptuously dismissive , ' he told the @entity63 website			0
' they were smirkingly , eyeball - rollingly contemptuous of even the most modest treaty reforms			0
' after mr @entity0 's deal with party leader @entity68 ( left ) , a poll suggests he 'll win a by - election in @entity11 however , mr @entity0 's potential differences with senior figures in @entity5 emerged as he argued with one supporter who suggested the @entity73 was being exploited by immigrants			1
' remember the @entity75 , the [ multicultural ] opening ceremony , i do n't know about you but that made me feel so good about this country , ' he told the voter			0
' we were all together and we 've got to have that sense of we 're all together			0
' later , out of earshot of the @entity5 supporter , he told his interviewer : ' i dislike that nativism			2
' last night mr @entity38 told a meeting of the @entity89 of @entity1 backbenchers to focus on the ' big issues '			2
@entity93 mayor @entity92 ( left ) has brushed off suggestions he rejected a plea to stand in the by - election , which falls on the birthday of prime minister @entity38 ( right ) the prime minister said : ' @entity99 to @entity11 , do the job , fight for every vote			1
the future of our country lies in who can best run the economy			0
' the @entity15 are considering a fullscale open primary - in which anyone in the constituency could vote - to choose their candidate to take on mr @entity0			1
it would embarrass the defector , who has previously supported their use but has been imposed on the local @entity5 association			2
this triggered a furious response from @entity118 , its existing general election candidate			0
@entity93 mayor @entity92 brushed off suggestions that he rejected a request from @entity121 to fight the seat			0
he said he had already ' whacked in the cv ' for the west @entity93 constituency of @entity125 .			0

@entity0 caused shock in @entity24 by defecting to @entity5
poll in @entity11 , @entity10 suggests he will easily win coming by - election
win would make him first member of parliament for @entity68 's party
result would be *setback* for @entity38 and his policies on the @entity139
