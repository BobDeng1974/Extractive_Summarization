about 70 firefighters were called to the blaze in @entity15 , @entity5 , which broke out around 1.40am on wednesday			1
the fire started in a building near the squatters ' camp but investigators do n't think the group , aged in their late teens and early 20s , had anything to do with it starting			2
crews were stunned to find 18 people , thought to be from @entity110 and @entity154 , squatting in the containers at the site on @entity157			1
firefighters thought they had been called to a run - of - the - mill industrial fire but it quickly became a rescue operation when people began running out from the back of the bus parking businesss			1
the squatters were living in shocking conditions on mattresses in a shipping container , an old mini-bus and a caravan			2
four people were rescued and 14 evacuated by firefighters from the fire , which firefighters described as a ' severe threat to life ' @entity178 & rescue commissioner @entity179 said four people had to be rescued as they were too frightened to move			1
' there were 20 - metre flames , ' he told reporters on wednesday			0
' had the firefighters not realised they were there , they well could have lost their lives			2
' ' i 'm outraged that there would be something like this in the heart of @entity5 , ' he said			1
' it looks like someone has been taking advantage of these people , maybe they were squatters we do n't know yet			0
' the tourists have since been taken to alternative accommodation , a hotel in the cbd			0
the owner of the property , who claimed to live on site , spent the morning exploring the smouldering damage alongside detectives , and it 's understood he knew the backpackers were lodging in his building , as he confirmed the headcount of people for the firefighters			1
he refused to answer any questions from media about the unusual living arrangements as he got into a car with detectives on wednesday morning			0
a man who kept his bus parked on the property said he had no idea backpackers were living on site			1
' it 's a bit of a shock , ' said the man , who called himself @entity225			0
fire crews are seen mopping up after a fire ripped through a bus and caravan storage depot in an industrial area at @entity15 inspector @entity231 said the fire was extremely intense and fast - moving and posed a serious risk to life			1

' it was very intense			0
it was that intense vehicles were melting on the other side of the car park			0
