budding scientists and mathematicians may be better off heading to the @entity3 or @entity4 to study for a degree as the @entity6 lags behind in these subjects , new rankings reveal			2
@entity6 universities are facing increasingly stiff competition from other nations in science , technology , engineering and maths ( @entity16 ) disciplines			1
the 10 subjects with the fewest @entity6 universities in the top 200 - those 200 institutions that are considered the best places to study the discipline - were all science and maths based subjects			1
but those students planning on careers in areas such as geography , history , @entity28 and modern languages should look at studying at @entity30 or @entity31 , which are considered the best in the world for these disciplines			1
@entity3 leads the boards : @entity35 was ranked number one in 11 subjects and @entity38 in nine the latest annual @entity39 shows that globally , @entity30 is the @entity6 's best performing institution			1
it took first place in three subjects - @entity28 language and literature , modern languages and geography			1
this means it was rated number one more than any other university in the world except @entity35 and the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , both in the @entity3			2
@entity35 was ranked number one in 11 subjects and @entity38 in nine			1
@entity31 was ranked first globally in one subject - history			0
1 - @entity35 , @entity3 2 - @entity38 , @entity3 3 - @entity30 , @entity6 4 = - @entity55 , @entity3 4 = - @entity31 , @entity6 while the @entity6 is still performing strongly in the arts and humanities , the findings suggest , it is falling behind in maths and science			1
of the 10 subjects with the most @entity6 universities in the top 200 - those 200 institutions that are considered the best places to study the discipline - just two were @entity16 - related			2
these were psychology and environmental science			0
and the 10 disciplines that had the fewest @entity6 institutions in the top 200 were all science and maths based subjects			0
these were agriculture , chemical engineering , mathematics , electrical engineering , computer science , physics , materials science , pharmacy , chemistry and earth and marine science			0
the top universities for these subjects globally were all institutions in the @entity3			0
an analysis of the rankings also found that 19 of the top 50 universities for geography and 15 for @entity28 language and literature were in the @entity6 , but only three for civil engineering , less than @entity95 and @entity96			2
in total , @entity4 had 10 of the top 30 institutions in the areas of chemical , civil and electrical engineering and eight for mechanical engineering			0
@entity102 planning on careers in areas such as geography , history , @entity28 and modern languages should look at studying at @entity30 or @entity31 @entity39 head of research @entity109 said : ' the @entity6 remains second only to the @entity3 , but it now faces far stiffer competition in the @entity16 disciplines			1
' the leading @entity4 institutions can now be considered serious global players , particularly in the fields of science and technology			0
' the @entity39 rankings rated universities worldwide in 30 different subject disciplines , based on the opinions of academics and employers			0
the results also looked at the @entity6 's national picture and found that on this measure , @entity31 outperformed @entity30			0
only looking at @entity6 institutions , @entity31 was ranked first nationally in 14 subject areas , while @entity30 was top in 10			1
the @entity130 was first for sociology , economics and communication and media studies , @entity129 was top for linguistics , @entity136 for agriculture and the @entity138 was first for education .			0
