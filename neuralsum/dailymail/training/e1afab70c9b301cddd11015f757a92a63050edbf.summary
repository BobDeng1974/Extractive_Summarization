two convicted @entity1 extremists who were deported from @entity2 in 2012 have emerged as jihadis fighting for @entity4 in @entity5 - one as a senior commander , and the other as a suicide bomber			1
@entity9 , 30 , and @entity10 , 25 , were convicted of entering the @entity2 in possession of computers filled with radical material , including a chilling document explaining how to make bombs			1
the @entity18 nationals , who are both @entity20 converts from the city of @entity22 , were remanded at @entity24 high security prison awaiting trial and , upon being convicted , the @entity16 was able to send them back to @entity18 to serve their respective 16 and 12 month jail sentences			1
it has now emerged , however , that both men subsequently made their way to join the @entity30 in @entity5 - with @entity9 a senior commander based in the terror group 's stronghold @entity34 , and @entity10 a suicide bomber who @entity4 claimed had blown himself up in a sickening recent propaganda video			1
@entity37 : calling himself @entity39 speaks withauthority on behalf of the terror group 's leadership , and details @entity4 ' future strategies and chilling plans to expand into @entity45 @entity46 : @entity18 national @entity10 reportedly appeared in a sickening suicide bomb attack that @entity4 filmed and released online in a five - minute long propaganda video titled ' our state is victorious ' convicts : @entity9 , 30 , ( left ) and @entity10 , 25 , ( right ) were convicted of entering the @entity2 in possession of computers filled with radical material , including a document explaining how to make bomb details of @entity9 's rise within @entity4 emerged when maverick @entity18 journalist @entity59 recently spent 10 days with @entity4 in @entity34 - the oil rich city in north west @entity5 which was captured and occupied by the terrorists in june of this year			1
remarkable footage taken within the city shows how everyday life is continuing within the city , despite the militants enforcing a brutal interpretation of @entity70 law , deliberately destroying ancient buildings and monuments and forcing @entity73 to either convert , pay a tax , or face execution			0
although hundreds of thousands of persecuted locals have fled the area over the past few months , @entity59 has spent that time in deep online conversation with representatives of terror leader @entity80 , and was eventually granted permission to travel to @entity34			2
the journalist was provided with written assurances that he would come to no harm during his visit and fighters gave him a guided tour around the city - including visiting the @entity34 mosque where @entity90 famously gave a public sermon upon his self - declaration as a new caliph			2
while many of the jihadis tell of their experiences fighting for the @entity30 , one calling himself @entity39 speaks with greater authority on behalf of the terror group 's leadership , and details @entity4 ' future strategies and chilling plans to expand into @entity45			1
this man is @entity9 , the former radical convicted of bringing computers laden with terror material into @entity107 - including a copy of the official @entity110 magazine inspire which featured an eight - page article titled ' how to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom '			1
militant : wearing a bobble hat and spectacles , clean - shaven @entity10 could easily be mistaken for any bookish young westerner			2
that is until he points at a detonator on his vest and utters the chilling phrase : ' with a press of the button , everything blows up '			0
later in the @entity4 video he carries out a suicide attack blast : a recent @entity4 propaganda video shows @entity18 national @entity10 - who called himself by the @entity131 or @entity132 - blowing himself up in a suicide bomb attack past : the @entity134 , which monitors @entity18 jihadis , claims @entity9 changed his name to @entity137 while held at @entity24 awaiting trial speaking to @entity59 in a video report published by @entity140 , @entity9 vowed that @entity4 would soon bring their campaign of brutality and persecution to @entity45			1
' we will conquer @entity45 one day			2
it is not a question of if we will conquer @entity45 , just a matter of when that will happen			2
but it is certain , ' he said			0
' and the @entity45 need to know that when we come , it will not be in a nice way			0
it will be with our weapons			0
and those who do not convert to @entity1 or pay the @entity1 tax will be killed , ' he added			0
' our expansion will be perpetual ... for us , there is no such thing as borders			0
there are only front lines , ' @entity9 went on to say			0
when asked about @entity4 ' treatment of those practicing other religions , the militant said the terror group will ' kill them all ' , adding : ' 150 million , 200 million or 500 million , it does not matter to us '			1
his shocking views on @entity4 ' barbaric practice of taking female sex slaves was equally barbaric			0
' i would say that slavery is a great help to us and we will continue to have slavery and beheadings , it is part of our religion ... many slaves have converted to @entity1 and have then been freed			0
' on the subject of @entity4 ' filming their savage beheading of @entity182 journalists and aid workers , @entity9 said : ' people should really think about the case of @entity186 ... he did not get killed because we started the battle			2
he got killed because of the ignorance of his government that did not give him any help			0
' tour : the journalist was provided with written assurances that he would come to no harm during his visit and fighters gave him a guided tour around the city - including visiting the @entity34 mosque where terror leader @entity80 ( pictured ) famously gave a public sermon upon his self - declaration as a new caliph stronghold : although @entity206 airstrikes continue to bombard @entity4 targets , @entity59 thinks the militants are unlikely to be defeated in @entity34 ( pictured ) anytime soon @entity9 's shocking comments came just weeks after his partner in crime @entity10 reportedly appeared in a sickening suicide bomb attack that @entity4 filmed and released online in a five - minute long propaganda video titled ' our state is victorious '			1
wearing a knitted bobble hat and spectacles , clean - shaven @entity10 could easily be mistaken for any bookish young westerner until he points at a detonator on his suicide vest and utters the chilling phrase : ' with a press of the button , everything blows up			1
' the video then cuts to a scene showing an explosion and the vehicle in which @entity10 - who called himself by the @entity230 or @entity132 - had been travelling is seen as a fireball			0
the sickening attack came just two years after @entity10 converted to @entity1 in the same @entity18 city , @entity234 , as his friend @entity9			1
the pair quickly became embroiled in the more radical side of the religion and , after leaving prison following his @entity2 conviction , lived a radical mosque in the city			0
when the group was banned later in 2012 , many of its members reportedly went to @entity247 to support the @entity248			0
at some point over the next two years , both @entity9 and @entity10 instead travelled to @entity250 where they waged jihad on behalf of the @entity30			1
caliphate : a map purportedly showing the areas @entity4 plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online			0
as well as the @entity258 , @entity259 and large areas of @entity261 , it also reveals @entity4 ' ambition to extend into @entity45			2
@entity263 , which was @entity20 - ruled until the late 15th century , would form part of the caliphate , as would the @entity267 states and eastern @entity45 , up to and including @entity268 the oil rich city of @entity34 was captured and occupied by @entity30 terrorists in june of this year @entity59 's incredible journey to visit the @entity4 - held city of @entity34 was the result of months of negotiations via @entity276 with the terror group 's senior leadership			1
having previously written articles critical of @entity4 , @entity59 demanded written assurances that he would not come to harm and , astonishingly , the terror group kept their word			1
upon return the journalist told how @entity4 is a larger and more united force than is widely believed in the @entity286 , and said he was concerned @entity206 and @entity2 had underestimated the jihadis			1
@entity59 said that he stayed in a recruitment house where 50 new foreign fighters arrived every single day , and was introduced to militants who claimed their success is driven by their not fearing death , while their enemies - including the @entity5 army - do not have the stomach for the battle			2
in one heartbreaking encounter a young boy clad in @entity4 ' black uniform identifies himself as being just 13 - years - old			0
although his smiling face is one of innocence , the assault rifle in his hands points to a dramatically different future for this young jihadi - in - training			0
although @entity206 airstrikes continue to bombard @entity4 targets ahead on an expected @entity5 army spring offensive to force the terrorists out of their strongholds , @entity59 thinks the militants are unlikely to be defeated anytime soon			1
' i think the @entity30 is a lot more dangerous than @entity182 leaders realize ... they believe in what they are fighting for and are preparing the largest religious cleansing campaign the world has ever seen , ' he said .			0

@entity9 and @entity10 entered @entity2 with radical material in 2011
