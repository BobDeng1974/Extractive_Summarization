half of today ’s 20 - year - olds will never marry , striking research reveals			1
instead , couples are increasingly choosing to cohabit without ever deciding to commit			0
a report published today using the latest data from the @entity6 reveals a generational shift away from the institution of marriage , with youngsters far less likely ever to wed than their parents and grandparents			1
the research by the @entity14 shows that , for a variety of reasons , 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry			1
half of today 's 20 - year - olds will never marry , new data suggests			1
instead they will cohabit without ever deciding to fully commit the baby boomer generation – born between the end of the @entity23 and the early 1960s – has maintained a healthy level of marriage , with 87 per cent of men and 92 per cent of women having married at some stage			1
but subsequent generations are facing a sharp decline in marriage rates			1
half of 40 - year - olds today are already married , but they are not expected to reach the levels set by their parents			1
work and pensions secretary @entity38 said : ' one of the starkest findings of this report is that young people ’s aspiration to marry so outstrips achievement			1
' we should respond by asking what stops them from doing so - looking at how we can remove any barriers that currently stand in their way , and ensuring they have the opportunity to realise their aspirations			0
' this government has already funded marriage preparation and relationship education for over 6,000 couples , but there is undoubtedly more to do			0
' i firmly believe in the importance of strong families as the foundation of a healthy society , and that marriage has a powerful role to play in securing the relationship that lies at their heart			0
' we know that stable loving families offer children the best possible start in life , so it is right that this government has taken steps to ensure families have the help and support they need to flourish			0
' from action to reduce the couple penalty left by @entity83 to the provision of relationship education and the recognition of marriage in the tax system , it is clear that we are unashamedly pro-family			0
' 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry for a variety of reasons , data shows according to current trends , only 61 per cent of men and 68 per cent of women aged 40 today will ever marry			1
however , the greatest decline in marriage has taken place among those in their twenties			1
in 1970 , the peak year for marriage , 564,818 men and women aged 25 got married			1
in 2010 , just 56,598 did , a fall of 90 per cent			2
today , only 5 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women aged 25 are married , as compared to 60 per cent of men and 80 per cent of women 44 years ago			1
when current trends are applied to today ’s 20 - year olds , figures show that only 52 per cent of those men and 53 per cent of women are expected ever to marry , despite strong aspirations to do so			1
researchers blamed a number of factors , including early cohabitation , which makes people less likely ever to tie the knot , celebrity divorces , and decades of undermining of the institution of marriage by the state			2
@entity121 , research director for the @entity14 , said : ‘ what we ’re seeing is the devastating trickle - down effect of the trend away from marriage			0
‘ at the moment , we have high proportions of parents and grandparents who have got married at some stage and for the most part stayed together			2
' they provide role models for the next generation			2
they also show what can be gained from making a marriage work in terms of the stability it provides for a family			0
‘ however , fewer of today ’s 40 - year - olds will be in a position to demonstrate the positives of a stable household cemented by marriage			1
‘ their children ’s generation , currently in their twenties , will suffer twofold ; first from a higher level of family breakdown when they themselves are young , and secondly from the lack of familiarity with the benefits of marriage as they look to start their own families			1
’ mr @entity121 said that the argument for marriage is ‘ not a moral or religious one , but based on concrete facts ’			0
‘ cohabiting couples account for only 19 per cent of parents but 50 per cent of family breakdown			2
among parents who stay together until their children reach 15 , a tiny 7 per cent are cohabiting couples , ’ he said			2
in its 13 years in power labour was accused of undermining marriage , and the @entity168 is almost alone in @entity169 in failing to recognise traditional family structures in the tax system			0
in last week ’s @entity173 , the government confirmed its intention to restore a recognition of marriage in the tax system			0
married couples where one partner pays no income tax will be able to transfer £ 1,000 of their tax allowance between them , saving them £ 200 a year			2
the @entity14 was founded by sir @entity182 , a high court judge , moved by his personal experience in 40 years as a barrister and judge specialising in family law			2
@entity188 yesterday put the brakes on a feminist campaign to reform ‘ sexist ’ marriage certificates			0
officials working for the home secretary said that changing the documents , used by thousands of register offices and churches , would be ‘ complex and costly ’ and that no modernisation is imminent			0
it followed reports yesterday that @entity201 equalities minister @entity200 was preparing to push through a change to the certificates – which demand that the bride and groom record the names of their fathers but not their mothers			0
the campaign to add mothers ’ names has been gathering pace , helped by an online petition which has reached 35,000 signatures			0
green mp @entity216 and @entity218 mp @entity217 both backed a @entity220 motion which said : ‘ our law should not perpetuate the offensive and outdated message that marriage is a business transaction between fathers ... change is needed so that mothers are no longer erased from important historical records ’ .			0
