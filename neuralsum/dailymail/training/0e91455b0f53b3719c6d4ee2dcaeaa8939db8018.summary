the pub owner who beat @entity1 in a multi-million pound @entity4 battle has told how the celebrity chef ruined his life			1
@entity7 has spoken out for the first time after defeating the celebrity chef in a case which centred on @entity1 's claim that his estranged father - in - law @entity12 had effectively forged his signature to commit him to a 25 - year contract for a @entity16 gastropub			1
but mr justice @entity17 poured scorn on @entity1 's claim that he had been duped over the use of a signature making machine to sign the agreement , calling his evidence ' entirely implausible ' and leaving him facing a £ 10million rent bill			1
but in 2010 @entity1 sacked @entity12 , who was chief executive of his companies , claiming he had been secretly siphoning off money from the business and subsequently lodged action against @entity7			2
mr @entity7 said : ' it completely destroyed my life and my family 's life			2
everything was put on hold			0
' he made my life a nightmare with an entirely spurious claim in an attempt to wriggle out of a loss making business , whereas if he had just asked me i could have done what he does on the tv with @entity1 's @entity57			1
@entity7 , the owner of the pub , has now criticised the chef for bringing the lengthy court case ' i could very easily tell him why his business is losing £ 4million a year			1
' the court heard that @entity1 had lined up the property for his star chef @entity64 and before the agreement was signed he had met up with @entity7 to discuss the deal			1
the film director said that @entity1 had ruined his business and family life , not least because he had put a legal ' notice ' against the @entity33 and @entity34 property to alert potential buyers that there was a legal battle surrounding ownership of the property			1
he said : ' my family and i had arranged to sell up in the @entity77 as we were moving to @entity79 to pursue opportunities			0
' we needed to sell the property to provide working capital for my new projects in @entity79 but the notice @entity1 had placed on it meant we could n't do that			2
' the children were already booked into schools in @entity86			0
i could n't not go there so we had to go and launch a business without funds			0
' the court heard that @entity12 , who knew that @entity7 would sue him if @entity1 won in court , initially helped @entity7 prepare his case against before the pair subsequently fell out			1
since @entity1 parted ways with @entity12 , the pair have been at loggerheads in and out of court with the chef saying he felt like a ' performing monkey ' and his wife @entity26 accusing her father of a ' distressing fraud ' in the @entity4			1
the @entity4 had heard that @entity12 used a ' ghost writer ' machine to put @entity1 's signature on a series of contracts but the celebrity chef claimed he did not have his consent to do this			1
but @entity1 's secretary @entity111 revealed that , after @entity12 had been fired in 2010 , she had told @entity1 and @entity26 about her concerns about the use of the ghost writing machine			2
the judge noted that @entity1 had never mentioned this when he had subsequently taken legal action against @entity12 the following year despite the apparent significance of this			2
in his judgement mr justice @entity17 said : ' mr @entity1 knew , long before the entry into the agreement for lease and the lease of the premises , that the machine was routinely used to place his signature on legal documents			1
' the dispute was over the @entity33 & @entity34 , where @entity1 opened a restaurant near @entity35 in @entity16 the judge added : ' i do not accept his evidence to the contrary			1
i find that when mr @entity12 committed mr @entity1 to the guarantee in the lease of the premises , mr @entity12 was acting within the wide general authority conferred on him by mr @entity1 at all times until mr @entity12 's dismissal in october 2010			2
' mr @entity1 may now regret the transaction in relation to the premises			0
he may particularly regret his involvement as a guarantor			0
he may consider that mr @entity12 did a bad deal			0
@entity1 claimed his estranged father - in - law @entity12 had effectively forged his signature to commit him to a 25 - year contract at the gastropub ' however , on any finding , he is not able to say that mr @entity12 exceeded his authority in any respect			1
mr @entity1 - acting through his agent mr @entity12 - is bound by the guarantee in the lease of the premises			1
' mr @entity7 said of learning about the victory : ' my 50th birthday occurred during the middle of the trial			0
my wife had booked a special surprise family celebration for me in a secret location at @entity167			0
i had to miss it			0
we are planning something else now , and that also will be a surprise			0
' @entity1 is now facing estimated court costs alone of £ 1.6million and was also told this week that his legal team had been refused permission to appeal			2
the celebrity chef 's restaurant empire fell £ 6.4million into the red last june , driven by one - off costs of £ 9million , with £ 6.7million relating to the @entity33 & @entity34 lease and £ 2million in legal expenses			1
of @entity1 , mr @entity7 added : ' i think he was very badly advised , and i hope that both of our families can now put this behind us and get on with our lives			0
if he rings me up , i will tell him what he needs to do to run the restaurant at a profit			0
' my solicitor @entity189 's work cracked the case			0
on the face of it , @entity1 had an open and shut case of his signature being forged on an important legal document			1
' it was through @entity189 's relentless work in dragging out other documents of @entity1 that we were able to show that the signature on the personal guarantee was not a one - off			2
' mr @entity189 , of @entity204 , said : ' i think people in public positions like @entity1 should set a better example			0
what is so worrying is that @entity1 could have got away with it			0
