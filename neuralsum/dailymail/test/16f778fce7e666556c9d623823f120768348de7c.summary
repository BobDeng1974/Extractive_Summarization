one of the men described the experience as ' a bit nerve racking ' while another man can be heard saying : ' i do n't think this is such a brilliant f * * * * * g idea you know '			0
another shark is spotted breaching near the small boat before the crew decide it is too unsafe to have a boat of that size in the water , while such large predators are in the area			2
one man can be heard warnning that while sharks are ' not malicious ' , they do ' kill things for a living '			0
