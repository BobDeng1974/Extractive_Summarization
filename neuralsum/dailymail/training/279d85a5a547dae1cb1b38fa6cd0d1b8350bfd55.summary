taxi drivers will face language tests to ensure their @entity2 is up to scratch , after customers complained they could n't have a conversation with them			1
the so - called ' l - test ' could be rolled out in @entity6 after council officials found many drivers could not chat to their passengers about common taxi subjects , such as the weather			1
they found that customers ' attempts at routine chitchat - such as ' busy tonight mate ? ' - were often met with a puzzled silence from the other side of the glass			1
a language test is set to be rolled out across @entity6 to ensure taxi drivers have good enough @entity2 to have a conversation with passengers ( file picture ) it comes as taxi and minicab bosses in the @entity27 city revealed that they are often asked by customers to have ' a driver who speaks @entity2 '			1
until now , drivers have had little to do to convince licensing officers they have mastered @entity2 as a second tongue			1
the rules say they must show a ' basic understanding ' of written and spoken @entity2 , which could be demonstrated by reading a paragraph out of paperback or filling in a receipt for a trip			2
but under proposals set to be approved by councillors this week , drivers will have to sit a ' conversation test ' before being granted a licence			2
they will have to show they understand a series of common questions asked by a council worker			1
licensing manager @entity48 said : ' the current new driver process is that an applicant needs to read a paragraph from a book and complete a receipt for a perceived journey			0
' a new procedure is proposed which requires an applicant to answer normal conversational questions such as , " what do you think of the weather recently ? where did you take your last customer ? how do get from a to b ? " ' @entity64 leader @entity63 said he hoped other councils around the @entity66 , including @entity67 , would follow @entity6 's lead			1
@entity64 leader @entity63 said he hoped other councils around the @entity66 , including @entity67 , would follow @entity6 's lead ( file picture ) he said : ' travelling by taxi is expensive and one of the compensations is a good chat and a good laugh			1
' i myself have travelled in many cabs in @entity67 with reputable companies who have @entity83 drivers using sat - nav barely able to converse a word with me			2
' speaking the language is a high requirement for an integrated society			0
so i would say @entity6 is entirely within its rights to do this			2
' @entity91 , admin officer for the industry 's @entity92 , said licensing officers should be able to tell when someone has the required standard of @entity2			1
he said : ' being able to communicate with a passenger is important			0
' reading one paragraph out of a book does not sound that clever			0
but a lot of it is down to the licensing officers themselves			0
' they should be able to tell when someone ca n't speak good @entity2 and tell them to come back when they can			0
but council 's do not work like that - it is far too simple			0
' @entity113 , chairman of the @entity114 , said : ' it is in the interests of the public			0
' some drivers may know how to drive but when they have a customer in the car they ca n't have a conversation			0
' the public do often say , " we want a driver that can speak @entity2 "			2
so we do get requests like that			0

so - called ' l test ' could be rolled out in @entity6 to check driver 's language
they will have to understand common questions , including about weather
@entity137 found many drivers are not able to have chit - chat with passengers
many customers also request a ' driver who speaks @entity2 ' when ordering
