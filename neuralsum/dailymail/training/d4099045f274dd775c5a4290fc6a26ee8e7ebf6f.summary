those senior moments when you lose your glasses or forget someone ’s name could one day be just a distant memory			0
a drug already used to treat motor neurone disease could prevent common memory lapses which can affect healthy people in their forties			1
researchers found the drug riluzole prevented connections between brain cells from weakening in experiments on older rats			1
senior moment ? you 're not alone - but a drug could help prevent the brain 's breakdown ( posed by model ) this is thought to prevent the cognitive deterioration that can occur in old age			1
professor @entity26 , of the @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ‘ by examining the neurological changes that occurred after @entity32 treatment , we discovered one way in which the brain ’s ability to reorganise itself – its neuroplasticity – can be marshalled to protect it against some of the deterioration that can accompany old age , at least in rodents			1
’ @entity32 works by helping control a chemical called glutamate which helps neurons communicate			0
but too much glutamate causes damage at the point at which the cells connect – their synapses			0
the team started giving the drug to rats once they reached ten months old , the rodent equivalent of middle age , when their cognitive decline typically begins			2
after 17 weeks of treatment , the animals performed better in memory tests than the ones left untreated , and almost as well as young rats , the @entity55 reported			1
frustration : the drug could prevent cognitive deterioration which worsens in old age ( posed by model ) for instance , when placed in a maze they had already explored , the treated rats recognised an unfamiliar pathway as such and spent more time investigating it			2
when the researchers looked inside the brains of treated rats , they found changes to glutamate within the hippocampus , where memories are consolidated , suggesting communication between brain cells had improved			1
prof @entity80 , of @entity81 , @entity28 , said : ' we have found in many cases , ageing involves synaptic changes that decrease synaptic strength , the plasticity of synapses , or both			2
' the fact @entity32 increased the clustering of only the thin , most plastic spines , suggests its enhancement of memory results from both an increase in synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity , which might explain its therapeutic effectiveness			2
' in this case , the clusters involved thin spines which are rapidly adaptable			0
the treated animals had more clustering than the young animals and their untreated peers , who had the least			0
this discovery led the researchers to speculate that , in general , the aged @entity32 appears to enhance this mechanism			0
researcher @entity107 , an instructor in clinical investigation in prof @entity26 's lab , added : ' in our study , this phenomenon of clustering proved to be the core underlying mechanism that prevented age - related cognitive decline			0

researchers found drug @entity32 stopped brain connections weakening
this could in turn stop memory lapses which affect people from age *40*
theory tested in @entity28 on rats who did better in memory tests
