by @entity0 published : 19:25 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 19:25 est , 8 june 2013 tipped for the top : senior insiders believe the @entity3 is a strong contender to become the next bishop of @entity5 a controversial @entity7 dean could become @entity9 ’s first openly gay bishop			1
senior insiders believe the @entity3 , the dean of @entity11 , is a strong contender to become the next bishop of @entity5			1
if elected next month , the @entity13 - born cleric would be the @entity9 ’s first @entity7 bishop in a civil partnership , a development that would send shockwaves through the church worldwide			2
however , insiders said the mood in @entity9 was changing and many worshippers would accept a gay bishop as long as he was celibate , as dr @entity3 is			2
the dean , a respected theologian , is said to have been unfairly treated because of his sexuality			0
dr @entity3 , a prominent advocate for gay marriage , was at the centre of a storm over gay clergy in 2003 when he was forced to step down as bishop of @entity28 by the then archbishop of @entity30 after a backlash by conservatives , particularly in @entity33 and @entity34			0
the men were close friends , but colleagues of dr @entity3 , right , also accuse dr @entity37 of helping to block the dean from becoming bishop of @entity40 in 2010			2
dr @entity3 , who has been in a civil partnership with hospital chaplain the @entity43 for seven years , has even considered suing the @entity7 for discrimination and hired a leading employment lawyer			1
the @entity7 has now relaxed a ban on clergy in civil partnerships becoming bishops , but friends believe 60 - year - old dr @entity3 stands little chance of getting a post in @entity7 because he has been too outspoken			1
rift : dr @entity3 was forced to step down as bishop of @entity28 by the then archbishop of @entity30 , pictured , after a backlash by conservatives , particularly in @entity33 and @entity34 insiders believe that he has more chance in the @entity57 , which is headed by its own archbishop , @entity58			0
archbishop @entity58 , a leading liberal , has made it clear he would be happy to welcome a gay bishop			0
but although dr @entity3 was born in @entity61 , @entity62 , close to the @entity5 diocese , he has spent most of his career in the @entity7 in @entity7 , which may prove a disadvantage when members of clergy and lay electors meet in @entity69 to chose a candidate			1
he is expected to face stiff opposition from the clergy who feel they want a local candidate when bishop @entity74 steps down after ten years later this month			0
