a desolate urban ghost town , it is hard to believe that these streets belong to @entity3 , formerly a major hub of the north 's cotton and textile industry			1
with rows and rows of boarded up terraced housing , anyone unfamiliar with the area would be forgiven for mistaking the wasteland site as a scene of war or natural disaster			2
this is @entity18 , an area of @entity3 with a less than sparkling reputation , which would 've once housed a bustling community of factory workers and their families			2
but although the scene looks bleak now , these streets could soon be thronged with families again as a £ 10million project to revive the area that will eventually see 200 of these homes given a makeover has started			2
wasteland : a boy kicks a football around in a scene that looks like something out of television soap @entity36 , but these homes currently stand empty vacant : @entity40 in general has the highest proportion of vacant homes according to a recent survey , with just over seven per cent of @entity45 homes currently empty desolate : rows and rows of terraced housing in @entity3 , @entity40 , stands desolate after the government pulled the plug on a redevlopment scheme			1
but the area looks set to be given a new lease of life thanks to private investement bleak : a lone woman walks through the empty streets of @entity59 , @entity3			1
developers hope that these streets will soon be bustling with a project underway to create four - bedroomed homes fit for the 21st century family gone : dozens of children 's hand prints adorn a wall in @entity3			1
the @entity59 area was once home to hundreds of families but now stands empty isolated : around 25 per cent of homeowners were left isolated n the @entity59 area when the government pulled the plug on the @entity75 according to @entity77 deputy leader @entity76 , the @entity59 area was left in limbo when the coalition government came into power in 2010 and dropped the @entity75			1
by the time the project was dropped , plans were afoot to demolish and redevelop much of the area , with around 75 per cent of residents having already moved out			0
she said : ' the problem here is not a lack of housing , it 's that we have the wrong kind of housing			0
we found that there 's no call for ' two up , two down ' housing anymore			0
' we 're an old mill town and many of these homes were built before 1900 , they 're not energy efficient and it 's too cramped for a family living there			0
' when the government dropped the @entity108 scheme the area had around 25 per cent occupancy , we were unable to buy the remaining residents out and they were unable to sell because who would want to buy a house in an empty area			0
' but @entity114 is one of the lucky areas			0
depressing : a lone man walks down an alley separating two rows of terraces in @entity59 , @entity40			1
there is no longer a demand for ' two - up , two - down ' houses like these according to local councillor @entity76 glimmer of hope : private firm @entity127 has stepped in and offered @entity77 money to complete a £ 10million regeneration scheme of these streets deluge : rain pours down the walls of empty former council houses in the @entity40 town of @entity3 as it waits to be modernised by private developers uprooted : 75 per cent of residents had left the area before plans to flatten these @entity114 homes and regenerate the area ground to a halt , they are now completely empty a private company , @entity144 , stepped in and fresh £ 10million plans to give the area a new lease of life are being put into action this week			1
five ghost town streets are to be spruced up with traditional terraced homes knocked through to create four - bedroomed homes fit for 21st century families in time for the beginning of 2014			2
eventually 200 homes will be given a 21st century revival			2
ms @entity76 said : ' the homes will be below market rental price so we hope to mix up the community			0
we want to use this to really sell @entity3			0
' before the industrial revolution , @entity3 was thought of as a ' considerable village '			0
but but a number of cotton and textile mills were built in the town in the mid 18th century providing work for much of the town			0
the industrial revolution saw a huge boom in population in the area and the population increased by more than four times its size in 100 years between 1811 and 1911			0
deserted : the area looks more like the scene of a war or a natural disaster with the majority of windows and doors boarded up and the remainder broken good value : the new houses in @entity114 are to be rented for lower than market value and councillors hope it will ' mix up ' the population revival : eventually 200 homes are to be given a complete revamp in @entity3 while much of the country , particularly @entity192 and the south , struggles to solve the lack of housing for burgeoning populations with many @entity192 boroughs desperately taking to moving some council residents out of the city and further north due to a lack of space , @entity3 belongs to @entity40 - the county with the highest proportion of vacant houses , according to a recent survey			1
in @entity45 alone , the local authority which @entity3 is a part of , just over seven per cent of houses stand empty			1
but in neighbouring @entity210 , the situation is even worse with almost 7.5 per cent of homes left vacant - a staggering 3,000 properties			1
and the figures are n't much better in @entity214 and @entity215 with @entity216 either , according to figures from the @entity219 charity			0
despite the well - documentated housing crisis , there are said to be some 850,000 dwellings empty nationwide .			1

@entity40 has the highest proportion of vacant homes , neighbouring @entity215 has 3,000 empty dwellings

the @entity59 area of @entity3 is to undergo a revamp that will see 200 of these homes given a new lease of life
