sorry , sir : @entity1 ( pictured this week , left ) has apologised to a former teacher for ' showing - off ' when he was a 15 - year - old schoolboy in @entity17 ( right ) in his letter in the @entity24 to publicise the awards , which will be on @entity26 on sunday , mr @entity1 wrote : ‘ you were , without any pretension or pomposity , attempting to coax a group of hormonal lads to look beyond familiar horizons and venture further			1
' and all we could do was compete to think of clever - dick questions to embarrass you and indulge in pathetic showing - off at your expense			2
’ he added : ‘ you wanted us to enjoy some of the pleasure you had found in the very best that had been thought and written			2
but we were a cocksure crew of precociously assertive boys who recognised you were only a few years older – a rookie in the classroom – and therefore ripe for ragging			1
and because we misbehaved , we missed out			0
‘ but because you cared , you persevered			0
and for that you deserve my apology			0

' he was already known for his sharp wit , strongly held beliefs backed by apparently limitless general knowledge and keen debating skills , which resulted in the downfall of many opponents			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s often hard to know how much is genuinely being communicated in a classroom , so it was highly gratifying to learn that @entity1 not only remembers the content of my lessons but also appreciates the wider learning that i was aiming to encourage			0
