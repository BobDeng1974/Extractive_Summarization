scarred : @entity0 was shocked after her @entity2 tummy tuck left her midriff badly deformed and her looking like a man @entity6 could barely believe her luck when she was told she could have a tummy tuck on the @entity2			1
after losing nine stone in just a year , thanks to a gastric bypass ( also on the @entity2 ) , the 36 - year - old nanny from @entity10 , @entity11 , had been left with large amounts of unsightly loose skin around her abdomen			1
@entity0 , who was once 21st 8lb , hoped the procedure – called an apronectomy or mini tummy tuck – would restore her self - confidence			2
instead , the operation left her deformed , revolted and despairing every time she looked at her body			1
‘ i was so happy to finally lose weight but i was left with a lot of excess skin and it was making me miserable			1
so , at my yearly check - up , i asked my surgeon if anything could be done to correct it			2
he said he would refer me for a tummy tuck , which would get rid of the loose skin			1
i was really pleased when he said i could get the operation on the @entity2			1
‘ i was referred to the @entity36 in @entity37 and had an appointment with plastic surgeon @entity39			2
he spent five minutes talking to me about the operation and left the rest up to his registrar [ a junior doctor ]			1
‘ mr @entity39 did manage to tell me about possible risks of the surgery			2
he said that i would lose my belly button but it was only another scar and that i ’d already have a huge scar across my stomach anyway , ’ says @entity0 , who lives with fiance @entity43 , 44 , a painter and decorator			1
‘ i did n’t like the thought of not having a belly button			1
it ’s something that you have from birth and very much a part of you – not just another scar			2
‘ but when a surgeon tells you that it ’s a normal part of the operation , you put your trust in him			1
i went along with it because i did n’t know any better			2
‘ he also said that i may have flaps of skin at each hip , which he called “ excessive dog ears ”			1
i assumed that this too was normal and so i consented to the surgery			2
i had no idea it would turn out the way it did			2
’ nothing he said prepared @entity0 for the horrific results of the operation in february 2009			1
‘ when i came round , mr @entity39 told me that he ’d removed nearly 7lb of excess skin and was pleased with the result			1
‘ when i took the bandages off , i did n’t know what to expect			2
‘ i had never seen the results of a tummy tuck before , so if anything , i was pleased that so much skin had been removed			1
i had a horizontal scar from hip to hip that measured over 12 inches long and cut straight across the middle of my stomach			0
‘ i had , as predicted , no belly button and large flaps of skin that hung over my hips			1
i also had a thick pouch of skin that sagged from the centre of my stomach over my pubic bone so , to put it delicately , i looked like a man			1
’ yet mr @entity39 assured her that the state her body was left in was perfectly normal			0
‘ people even asked me if i was going through a sex change because you could see a bulge through my clothes			0
i started to refuse invitations to go out – i hated the thought that people could see what a bad shape i was			0
my boyfriend at the time never mentioned it			0
‘ he knew how upset i was and was aware that it was not something he should talk about			0
’ her former self : @entity0 on holiday with a friend before she lost the nine stone thanks to an @entity2 gastric bypass operation after two years of suffering in silence , @entity0 decided to investigate corrective surgery – specifically tackling the pouch of flesh above her groin			1
‘ mr @entity39 told me that he did n’t do that kind of operation			1
he said it would have to be done privately – and suggested the name of a surgeon , but after everything that had happened i decided i ’d find my own doctor			0
’ she settled on cosmetic surgeon @entity132 , who admits he was horrified by @entity0 ’s post-operative body			0
‘ in all the years i ’ve been practising i ’ve never seen an abdomen like hers , ’ he says			0
‘ the scar that should have been near her bikini line was high up above where her navel should be			0
the fact she had no belly button at all really shocked me			1
‘ of course there is always a risk with this kind of surgery that you can lose a portion of the navel , but it was not acceptable that she ’d been left in that state and i was really angry on her behalf			0
’ the corrective surgery by mr @entity132 would normally have cost £ 15,000 – an amount @entity0 says she could n’t afford			0
instead , mr @entity132 offered her the chance to appear in a television series that he was taking part in , which would mean she could have the surgery for free			1
‘ i was nervous but i did n’t feel like i had many other options , ’ she says			0
‘ i felt so upset that the @entity2 surgeon seemed unconcerned by the cosmetic results of the operation			1
i was shocked by what mr @entity132 had said but it was also something of a relief to have him confirm what i knew in my heart – that the way i looked was n’t normal at all			0
i was absolutely gutted that i had been led to believe it was all ok			0
’ @entity0 underwent the five - hour corrective operation in june this year			1
mr @entity132 says : ‘ the previous procedure seemed to be very badly planned			0
when you perform surgery , you ’re always taught that before you cut , you have to consider how you are going to close the wound			0
in @entity0 ’s case , it seemed that the surgeon had cut without thinking it through			0
’ @entity2 : the @entity36 in @entity177 , north @entity37 , where @entity0 's operation was carried out mr @entity39 is a consultant plastic surgeon and honorary senior lecturer at @entity180 , @entity37			1
his research interests are listed as hand surgery and prosthetic reconstruction			0
it is @entity2 policy not to allow individual surgeons to speak to the media about specific cases			0
however , the @entity189 gave a statement saying : ‘ we are sorry to learn that ms @entity6 was unhappy with the results of her operation although she has not made a formal complaint			1
‘ she was advised that it might not be possible to preserve her navel and it was also emphasised that following surgery , she might be unhappy with the cosmetic appearance of her abdomen			0
‘ ms @entity6 signed a consent form indicating that she understood this information and wished to proceed			1
following substantial weight loss , people may be left with excess folds of skin in the abdominal area , which can cause skin infections			1
‘ in order to alleviate these problems , @entity2 patients may be offered an apronectomy			2
in contrast , an abdominoplasty operation is a cosmetic surgery procedure where the aim of the operation is to improve the aesthetic appearance of the abdomen , and this includes preserving the navel			2
the @entity2 does not routinely offer this operation			2
’ @entity0 simply says : ‘ i did n’t have skin infections			2
i believed the operation would make me look better			2
would he have left his wife or daughter in that state ? ’ there has been a huge rise in post-obesity surgery in the past decade , linked to the increasing numbers of patients undergoing gastric banding and bypass – about 14,000 of these operations were carried out last year			0
as the number of operations rises , so does the number of complaints			0
‘ complaints are usually due to poor outcomes , ’ says @entity240 , an expert in medical negligence at @entity243 solicitors			0
‘ we have about 50 similar cases a year – split equally between the @entity2 and private sector – and usually the problem lies with a breakdown in communication with patient and surgeon			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 simply wants to get on with her life			0
‘ i wish that i ’d never had the tummy tuck in the first place			0

after losing nine stone , @entity6 was offered an operation to remove loose skin from her belly . the result was devastating
