click here for @entity2 's brilliant @entity1 from @entity3 v @entity4 one run has ended and another continued , but only @entity6 had cause to smile about this result			1
@entity9 was far more preoccupied with how this one got away , even if it did mean @entity3 have now gone five matches unbeaten in this excellent season of personal vindication			1
make no mistake , this game was there for the taking for a free - scoring team who suddenly got the jitters in front of goal			1
@entity24 was that more obvious than in the frenzied late stages of the second half			2
@entity4 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity28 8 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 7 , @entity54 5.5 ( @entity55 88 ) , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 6 ; @entity58 6 ( @entity59 90 ) , @entity60 6.5 , @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 6 ; @entity63 5 subs ( not used ) : given , @entity66 , @entity46 , @entity67 , @entity65			1
booked : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 referee : @entity69 attendance : 34,857 @entity44 , the @entity71 player of the month for october , was guilty of one woeful header , @entity35 of another			1
when @entity43 came on in stoppage time for his first appearance of the season , he caused mayhem in the air			1
what an asset he could be in this attack if his fitness holds up , but even his headers could find no way past @entity28			0
‘ the sad thing is that when our finishing was very good their goalkeeper was even better , ’ @entity9 said			0
‘ other times i was a little disappointed with the finishing , given how good it has been			0
we are a little frustrated and disappointed , but we could n’t do any more			0
we have to respect the point			2
’ a point flattered @entity4 and delighted @entity6 , their manager			1
six defeats in a row was their worst top - flight run since 1964			1
at least that streak has gone , even if the hard times show no obvious sign of ending			0
‘ it was a really great point , ’ @entity6 said			1
‘ @entity28 did what he is paid for			0
his save at the end was world class			2
he ’s a top guy , a top pro. ‘ we put our bodies on the line and it is a massive point for us			2
credit to the team , they took a lot of stick at times			0
’ indeed , it really has been a tough season for them , even if @entity6 insisted confidence is good			1
he also felt @entity4 ‘ looked a threat ’ but in truth they were largely blunt , as they have been for much of the season			1
a return of five goals from 11 games is dire			0
the harsh suspension picked up by @entity123 against @entity124 last week did n’t help , and the lack of accuracy early on by his replacement , @entity63 , made matters worse			0
to the striker ’s credit , he created the 12th - minute opening that should have put @entity4 in front			1
but having sped past @entity36 to go clear , his shot was hopelessly high			0
who knows how significant those moments could be in the course of a season ? @entity3 players observe a @entity142 silence prior to the match against @entity4 at @entity33 players , officials and fans observe a @entity148 silence prior to the match in a general view of the scene at the @entity33 @entity4 winger @entity152 ( left ) vies for the ball with @entity3 's defensive midfielder @entity154 @entity4 manager @entity6 watches on from the dugout at @entity33 as the two sides battle it out during the first half @entity4 forward @entity63 is beaten in the air by @entity3 central defender @entity36 ( right ) @entity43 was all smiles as he returned to the @entity3 bench for the first time this season alongside @entity40 ( left ) @entity44 of @entity3 holds off @entity164 ( right ) of @entity4 as he attempts to start an attack @entity3 boss @entity9 gestures on the touchline as his side remains deadlocked until half time @entity168 miles @entity3 112.7 70.0 @entity42 90 11.8 7.4 @entity37 90 10.8 6.7 @entity41 90 10.7 6.7 @entity4 116.4 72.4 @entity164 90 12.0 7.5 @entity62 90 10.9 6.8 @entity61 90 10.8 6.7 from there it was often an unrewarded @entity3 blitz			1
@entity36 almost atoned for his flat - footed defending with a header that @entity28 did well to save			2
and @entity44 then headed wide from an @entity37 cross			0
@entity41 , meanwhile , followed his @entity174 call - up with another impressive performance			2
set - pieces , runs from deep , long passes and fine crosses — at 30 he is having a fine late - career revival			2
he forced a save from @entity28 after 24 minutes and moments later retreated deep into his own half to thread a 50 - yard pass through a crowd and into @entity187 ’s path			1
he closed the half with a poor shot , but that was the only blot on a day when the quality of his deliveries was sublime			2
@entity9 said : ‘ i think people forget how exciting it is to see crossing and heading			0
’ and @entity4 ? @entity62 shot straight at @entity34 from a good position , but the sad truth is that their nearest miss came when @entity29 overhit a backpass and @entity34 ’s touch let the ball run close to the line			1
@entity4 looked tighter at the back in the initial stages of the second half but were battered in the final 15 minutes			1
somehow @entity28 was able to make the saves that kept them from conceding			0
@entity44 ’s 78th - minute miss was the worst			0
@entity46 ’s delivery was perfect but @entity44 ’s free header was n’t even on target			0
@entity44 missed a second header soon after and @entity35 ’s attempt went straight to @entity28			0
with that , @entity43 was sent on in stoppage time			2
he is often maligned but his gifts are obvious			0
twice he beat a swarm of markers to meet @entity41 crosses			0
@entity43 needs a run of games ; @entity4 will simply be pleased to have ended their run of defeats			1
@entity3 central defender @entity29 rises highest at the back to head away a long ball as @entity152 watches on @entity4 goalkeeper @entity28 ( right ) charges out in an attempt to save from @entity3 forward @entity229 @entity43 replaces team - mate @entity42 for @entity3 to make his first appearance of the season as boss @entity9 watches on			1
