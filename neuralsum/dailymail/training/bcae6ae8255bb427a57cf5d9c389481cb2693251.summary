anyone who has shelled out for an expensive phone lives in fear of dropping it			0
now the world 's ' most resilient screen protector ' has gone on sale , capable of surviving being hit by a hammer			2
during tests , the transparent screen , which is the same thickness as three pieces of paper , also remained undamaged when dropped while walking on tarmac , bricks and concrete , its manufacturer claims			1
called @entity16 , the protector is made from a custom - formulated polymer and can absorb five times the impact energy of @entity20 - the glass currently used on @entity23 and @entity24 screens , for example			1
during tests it was also able to withstand being dropped on bricks and tarmac even a 255g steel ball dropping from 48cm failed to scratch the screen and left the phone ' fully usable			1
' made by @entity41 - based @entity40 , the sheet can be fitted to the @entity23 , @entity42 and @entity43 and does not affect the touchscreen 's sensitivity			1
the screen comes with a self - adhesive silicone back and as the user wipes a cloth along the front of the film , it clings to the phone 's screen , but can be removed if necessary			1
its makers claim the @entity16 leaves ' no sticky residue or air bubbles ' and uses what 's called an oleophobic coating that makes it ' smudge proof ' ; meaning fingerprints do n't stick to it			1
an iphone 4 version of the scratch resistant screen will be available soon , with other models expected in the future			0
@entity16 was funded by a @entity70 campaign that ended in march this year and it is now on sale from @entity73 for Â£ 17.99			2
the makers explained on the campaign page : ' protecting mobile devices have been a big challenge			0
the @entity16 sheet , pictured , is the same thickness as three pieces of paper , around 0.029cm , and has a 95 per cent transparency rating			1
its makers @entity40 claim that it does n't affect the phone 's touchscreen the @entity16 also comes with an oleophobic coating making it resistant to smudges and fingerprints ' there are many great cases that already tackle some of the problems with outstanding solutions and we have seen some protection at insane levels , i.e. cases that enable smart devices to survive when a car runs over it			1
' however , there are very few products that attempt to protect the most vulnerable part of the phone - its screen			0
' therefore we were determined to design and engineer a screen protector that will be resistant to impacts			0
after a year of relentless research and development , the end product is @entity16			2
' the phone protector goes on sale as @entity112 , a provider of protection plans for gadgets , tested five smartphones , including @entity117 's new iphones , to see if they could withstand drops , dunks and other common hazards			2
its found that while the @entity43 and @entity42 scored similar on the ' @entity125 ' scale , the latest models are n't as durable as last year 's @entity23			0
the biggest loser , however , was @entity24 's @entity127 , which failed to work after being submerged in water and being dropped 5 feet off the ground , according to @entity130 - based @entity112			0
the phone that withstood @entity112 's torture test best was @entity134 's @entity133 new research by @entity112 reveals that the @entity42 & 5c were outshone by their predecessor , the @entity23 , and the @entity127 .			0

the transparent @entity16 protector is as thick as three sheets of paper
it can absorb up to five times the impact energy than current @entity20
the sheet was undamaged even after being dropped on bricks and tarmac
@entity16 does not affect a phone 's touchscreen sensitivity
