it was , claimed ok ! @entity1 , a ' dramatic delivery '			2
' it 's a girl for @entity5 ! ' screamed @entity6 , adding that the birth had been a ' last minute @entity8 '			1
accompanied by photos of prince @entity11 cradling a baby and crowds outside the @entity14 , the magazine promised details of ' family feuds ' and claimed @entity17 has already met his ' sister '			0
unfortunately for the titles , their excitable announcement of the birth of the @entity5 's second child has proved somewhat premature			0
by this point , @entity5 has totally mastered the art of looking put - together and ladylike ( as if she had any other choice ! )			2
there 's a reason why her outfits are endlessly replicated everywhere			0
of course , being royalty has something to do with it , but apart from that , @entity5 has majorly enviable style so its understandable why so many people want to get a piece of it to call their own			0
as every pregnant woman knows , it 's next to impossible to look chic and structured as your belly comes in , but @entity5 pulls it off with ease ! @entity31 of @entity32 's coat is amazingly still available over at @entity27 for close to one grand			0
but as we all know , once word gets out about where to buy this jacket , it 's sure to sell out super fast , so buy it while you still can ! if you do n't have the budget of a to - be - princess , one of our picks in the edit below should fit the bill ! @entity69 at @entity70 visit site which we want @entity73 at @entity74 visit site the @entity76 at @entity77 visit site @entity79 at @entity70 visit site asked to comment on the rumours and whether the @entity5 has indeed had her second baby , a spokesman for @entity82 said , simply : ' she has n't '			1
ridiculous though the latest round of @entity1 magazine covers are , this is not the first time @entity1 publications have run ludicrous stories about the @entity92			2
in 2012 , @entity93 claimed the @entity94 was dying and followed up with allegations of an ' evil plot ' mounted by the @entity97 to seize the throne			1
unsurprisingly , the @entity94 is still very much alive two years later and no such ' evil plot ' has been uncovered			1
the @entity97 is a frequent target of the tabloid , which regularly runs stories claiming she is trying to sabotage the @entity104 and @entity5 of @entity32 's relationship			2
dramatic delivery : ok ! @entity1 breaks the news of the royal birth with claims of a ' dramatic delivery ' panic : @entity6 says the @entity5 has had a girl and included lots of dramatic photos taken in 2013 @entity115 : the @entity97 is regularly a target for bizarre claims in @entity1 tabloids allegations : one paper ran a story that claimed @entity122 is a cross-dresser jealous of his mother 's clothes still alive : the queen , pictured at an investiture ceremony yesterday , was said to be dying in 2012 it has also run specious stories about prince @entity122 ' alleged penchant for cross-dressing and included claims attributed to ' sources ' that the @entity122 is jealous of his mother 's wardrobe			1
as a result , the tabloid alleged , the @entity5 had been ' picked to be the next @entity94 ' in place of @entity139			1
most of the paper 's more ridiculous claims remain unpublished in the @entity143 , with the @entity93 among the @entity1 tabloids to make their website inaccessible in @entity143 - a move designed to spare them the @entity143 's stricter libel laws , requirement for accuracy and from the ire of regulating bodies such as @entity152			1
the latest round of bizarre stories , which also include allegations that the royal family was kept out of the delivery room , are unlikely to @entity158 herself , who revealed that her due date is in ' mid to late april ' during an engagement on wednesday			0
she is also expected to join prince @entity11 next week for a round of engagements in south @entity164 , among them a visit to the @entity167 in @entity168			0
@entity169 , which was designed by architect @entity170 , is home to the @entity172 and was set up in memory of @entity174 , who was murdered by racist thugs in 1993 .			0

@entity1 magazines ok ! @entity1 and @entity6 made the claims this week
one claimed the @entity5 had ' a last minute @entity8 ' and a baby girl
@entity82 have *confirmed* that the reports are totally untrue
@entity1 tabloids have a history of publishing bizarre @entity188 stories
the @entity93 caused outrage in 2012 when it claimed the @entity94 was dying
it also alleged that @entity139 had mounted an ' evil plot ' to seize the throne
