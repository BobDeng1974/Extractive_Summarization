by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 is such a perennial winner that even his own coach mocked him when he missed out on gold at last month ’s @entity6 in @entity7			1
‘ he was saying “ how are you silver man ? ” , ’ recalled the greatest two - lap runner of all time			2
his coach , the @entity13 missionary brother @entity12 , was only teasing			2
anyone who appreciates @entity2 ’s greatness realises it is not diminished by defeat to @entity18 , the 20 - year - old @entity19 who was second behind @entity2 at @entity20 in what is widely accepted to have been the greatest 800 metres race in history			1
all smiles : @entity2 is one of the greatest middle - distance runners in history second best : @entity2 was beaten into second place at the @entity6 by @entity18 at @entity28 , @entity2 was not fully fit			1
before march he had not been able to run for 10 months because of a knee injury			1
but missing out on that @entity6 title has refocused the @entity31 ahead of saturday ’s @entity33 ’s @entity32 , where he will race over 600m for the first time			1
‘ the silver medal is what i settled for , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ it was the best i could do that night and i have to stay positive and learn from that			2
i know i was n’t at my best			0
if i say “ i have been out for almost a year and started training very late ” , it is always going to be very difficult to be at top form			0
‘ of course it ’s difficult for me ( not to win gold )			0
i have to build up gradually because when you stop , you can easily lose shape			0
i ’m not at my best , but i ’m trying to get there			0
’ lead : @entity2 was in front of @entity18 , but a late surge secured @entity6 gold for the @entity19 you can have this one : @entity2 and @entity18 share a joke after their 800 metres battle in @entity7 like all great sporting rivals , @entity2 and @entity18 are intent on using their battle to push the 800m world record lower than the 1min 40.91sec set by @entity2 in the @entity57 final two years ago			1
‘ i do n’t care who does it , ’ @entity18 says			0
‘ i just want us both to run fast			0
’ @entity2 added : ‘ we are looking forward to the coming years and seeing if we can bring down that world record together			1
it is a tough thing to go for , it needs a lot of preparation , proper training and perfect conditions			0
’ the world record over the rarely raced 600m is in more immediate threat tomorrow			1
it currently stands at 1min 12.21sec			0
‘ i ’m planning something around there , ’ said @entity2 , 25			2
it will not be long before he is a golden man again			0
the @entity33 ’s @entity32 and @entity74 grand prix final are at @entity75 tomorrow			2
