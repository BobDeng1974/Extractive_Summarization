by @entity1 reporter published : 12:17 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 13:36 est , 23 october 2013 two men are facing multiple criminal charges after a prank on a friend who was acting as a grand juror went terribly wrong			1
the incident started on oct. 16 when detectives from the @entity9 in central @entity10 were alerted to a threat made against a 41 - year - old man from @entity13 who was serving as the foreman for grand jury proceedings			1
the foreman told police that , while on break from the proceedings , he had found a troubling handwritten note on his truck that said he had been followed home			1
the note said : ' you better not find my dad guilty ! i followed you home last wednesday			0
i know where you live , a- - hole ! @entity29 sound familiar			0
' official evidence : this is the note found on the car of a grand jury foreman who was serving in @entity34 last week			1
the note was a prank left by two of the juror 's co-workers , but was taken seriously and lead to an extensive process of investigations the grand jury case was immediately halted as were put on the case to look into the threat			1
investigators traced the note - which was written on a guest check commonly used in restaurants - to the @entity51 restaurant in nearby @entity52 , according to the @entity53			0
upon showing a waitress the note left for the foreman , the waitress said she had found a similar note by the cash register when she came into work that day			2
she also said the note appeared to be in the same handwriting of another waitress that works at the restaurant			0
detectives then spoke with the waitress who wrote the note , who they reported was very cooperate			0
she said that two men had been in the restaurant the day before and had asked for some writing equipment			0
they said they planned to play a joke on a co-worker			0
one of the men wrote the note and then asked the waitress to re-write it so their friend would not recognize the handwriting			2
the waitress told police she agreed to do it but told the men it was a bad idea			2
they assured her they intended to tell their friend about the prank the following day at work			2
detectives then traced the credit card used to pay the bill at the establishment to a ' @entity92 '			0
traced : detectives tracked the threatening note back to this restaurant in @entity52 , @entity10			2
as it turned out the two men asked a waitress to write it for them so their friend would not recognize the handwriting they called the office of the foreman asking for a ' @entity92 ' but were told he was not in the office			2
a short time later police received a call from @entity106 , 33 , of @entity107 , who said the entire incident was a prank he and @entity112 , 35 , of @entity13 , were playing on a co-worker			1
@entity92 said he and @entity112 had taken photos of the note on the truck and planned to tell the foreman once he returned to work			1
detectives notified the foreman about what had happened and he was reportedly upset by what the pair had done			0
while police were content with the investigations , sheriff @entity125 said the implications of the prank - especially the interruption of a grand jury - were too serious to ignore			1
' this case was investigated by multiple detectives who were pulled from other priority cases they were working on , ' @entity132 told the @entity53			0
repercussions : the threat interrupted a grand jury trial happening here , at the @entity140 ' grand jury proceedings were interrupted as well because of the prank these men tried to pull on their friend			1
' hopefully the men find it as funny when they are involved with the judicial process as detectives will submit the investigation to the @entity149 and ask they review the case for criminal charges , including influencing a juror , @entity153 and @entity154 and @entity155			1
' @entity157 attorney @entity156 aid the case had affected way too many people and cost way too much money to be glossed over as a prank			0
' the trauma inflicted on the foreman , the risk of wrongful arrest for the innocent writer of the note , the great expense of the all - out investigation and , most importantly , the overall potential risk of tampering with the integrity of our judicial system requires my office 's action , ' mr @entity156 told the @entity179			1
the case against the two men is currently being reviewed .			0

@entity106 , 33 , and @entity112 , 35 , **decided** to leave terrorizing note on the car of a co-worker , who was acting as the foreman in a grand jury proceeding in @entity10
intended as a prank , the note made out the foreman 's life was in danger and was taken seriously by both the foreman and the police
court case was halted and police began searching for the note 's author
following a *lengthy* investigation , police have **decided** the prank was too serious to ignore and both men are now under review for a series of criminal charges
