by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 18:54 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 05:34 est , 18 october 2013 sir @entity1 who oversees the shadowy @entity2 , indicated the rules should be changed to make it more transparent the controversial court which can make life - or - death decisions and send people to jail in secret , came a step closer to being opened up to public and media scrutiny last night			1
addressing a conference in @entity13 , sir @entity1 , one of the country ’s most senior judges who oversees the shadowy @entity2 , indicated the rules should be changed to make it more transparent			1
the president of the @entity19 of the @entity19 said it should be treated in the same way as the family courts where media are allowed to attend proceedings			1
@entity1 was asked to consider what steps could be taken to increase the court ’s transparency by justice secretary @entity28 earlier this year			1
it was subject to an outcry following revelations by the @entity32 about @entity33 , who was jailed in secret after trying to remove her father from a care home			0
the judge said : ‘ my starting point is that , unless there is very good reason to the contrary , the [ @entity2 ] rules should start off in the same way [ as those governing the family courts ] , with the same starting point , and proceed in a similar fashion			2
' one very striking difference is that , in the family court , any accredited media representative has the right to attend all family proceedings			1
the starting point in the @entity2 is completely the other way round			0
' my feeling is that the starting point should be the same in both , so that there should be the same kind of presumptive right of media access to @entity2 proceedings , as there are in family proceedings , ' the @entity55 reported			2
controversial case : @entity33 was jailed in secret after trying to remove her father from a care home this month one of the country ’s most senior judges , @entity69 , president of the @entity70 , praised the @entity32 for exposing the secret jailing of mrs @entity33 by the court , which was set up in 2007 under @entity77 ’s @entity76			2
it gave the @entity80 draconian powers to intervene in the lives of those deemed unfit to look over their own affairs			0
the @entity32 highlighted miss @entity33 ’s shock when police arrived at her father @entity35 ’s care home to ‘ cart her off to jail ’			0
she had been sentenced in secret for disobeying court orders by trying to remove him from the home			0
the case forced lord chief justice , lord judge , to order that no one else should ever be jailed in private without the sentence and reasons for it being announced outside the closed courtroom			2
@entity1 is keen to further open up the family courts – which journalists can now attend but are more often than not prevented from reporting the details of a case			1
he said that while there were differences between the family court and the @entity2 , they should be part of a single system			0
more judgments should be published , so that the public could have confidence that justice was being done .			0
