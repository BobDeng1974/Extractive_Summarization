by @entity0 @entity2 's new president has snubbed the powerful incumbent prime minister @entity3 by nominating the deputy parliament speaker to form the new government			1
but the move raises fears of more infighting in the government as the country faces the threat of @entity14 militants in the north			1
a member of @entity3 's political bloc said ' we will not stay silent ' over the decision			1
@entity20 , @entity3 's son - in - law said : ' the nomination is illegal and a breach of the constitution			1
we will go to the federal court to object to the nomination			0
@entity3 's allies have declared the decision illegal @entity3 had indicated he would seek a third term as prime minister , rejecting calls by @entity14 , @entity34 , fellow @entity35 and regional power broker @entity36 to step aside for a less polarising figure who can unite @entity2 against a raging @entity14 insurgeny			1
in a televised address , @entity41 gave @entity43 30 days to form a new government and present it to parliament for approval , expressing his hope he would succeed			1
mr @entity26 , who pledged to form a government to ' protect the @entity2 people ' , was nominated for the post by the @entity51 , a coalition of @entity35 parties that mr @entity3 's @entity53 is part of , but has turned against him			1
mr @entity3 's @entity35 - dominated bloc won the most parliament seats in april elections and the prime minister sees himself as rightfully keeping the post			1
out in force : @entity2 chant pro-government slogans and display placards bearing a picture of embattled prime minister @entity3 during a demonstration in @entity65 taking to the streets : an @entity2 soldier stands guard amid tight security measures by @entity2 security forces during a pro-government demonstration to show support for embattled prime minister @entity3 in a midnight speech , mr @entity3 said he was filing a suit against the president for neglecting to name him prime minister by sunday 's deadline and all but demanded he be renominated			1
critics say mr @entity3 , a @entity35 , contributed to the crisis by monopolising power and pursuing a sectarian agenda that alienated the country 's @entity14 and @entity34 minorities			1
mr @entity26 's nomination came hours after mr @entity3 deployed his elite security forces in the streets of @entity65 , partially closed two main streets - popular spots for pro and anti-government rallies - as hundreds of his supporters took to the streets			1
precautions : @entity2 forces check people in @entity65 's commercial district of @entity97 as security measures are reinforced across the capital after @entity100 said he would take legal action against the new president ' we are with you , @entity3 , ' they shouted , waving posters of the incumbent premier , singing and dancing			1
@entity110 , a lawmaker from mr @entity3 's list , rejected the nomination of mr @entity26 arguing that this move ' runs against the constitution ' because mr @entity3 's party is the largest bloc and the @entity51 has no right to present any candidate			1
' this decision would lead the country to a big problem and the president bears full responsibility for this situation , ' he said			2
after @entity126 endorsed @entity128 's attempts to break three months of post-election political deadlock that have hamstrung @entity65 's response to the @entity131 , secretary of state @entity132 called on @entity3 not to resort to force or ' stir the waters ' when @entity2 were seeking a change of leader			1
in pointed remarks , he said : ' the government formation process is critical in terms of sustaining stability and calm in @entity2 and our hope is that mr @entity3 will not stir those waters			1
' there will be little international support of any kind whatsoever for anything that deviates from the legitimate constitution process that is in place and being worked on now			2
' as police and elite armed units , many equipped and trained by the @entity149 , locked down the capital 's streets , @entity132 added : ' there should be no use of force , no introduction of troops or militias in this moment of democracy for @entity2			0
' also monday , senior @entity149 officials said the @entity164 administration has begun directly providing weapons to the @entity34 peshmerga forces who have started to make gains against the @entity170 breakaway group			0
fleeing jihadists : @entity149 and @entity34 flags flutter in the wind while displaced @entity2 from the @entity175 community pour across the border from @entity177 into @entity2 after a week - long journey through blazing hot mountains president @entity164 warned @entity149 on saturday that the new campaign to bring security in @entity2 requires military and political changes and ' is going to be a long - term project			1
' @entity164 said @entity2 security forces need to revamp to effectively mount an offensive , which requires a government in @entity65 that the @entity2 military and people have confidence in			0
@entity164 said @entity2 needs a prime minister - an indication that suggests he 's written off the legitimacy of the incumbent , @entity3			1
critics say the @entity35 leader contributed to the crisis by monopolizing power and pursuing a sectarian agenda that alienated the country 's @entity14 and @entity34 minorities			0
just hours after @entity3 's speech , the @entity201 said sunday it ' fully supports ' the new @entity2 president			1
@entity201 spokeswoman @entity204 said in a statement the @entity149 supports the process to select a prime minister ' by building a national consensus and governing in an inclusive manner			0
' she said the @entity149 rejects any effort to use coercion or manipulation in the process of choosing a new @entity2 leader			0

in the @entity34 capital on sunday , the president of the semi-autonomous @entity257 , @entity258 , said @entity149 military support has been effective thus far , but , he added , peshmerga soldiers require more firepower to defeat the militants			1
' we are not asking our friends to send their sons to fight on our behalf , ' @entity258 told @entity268 in a brief interview			0
' what we are asking our friends is to provide us support and to co-operate with us in providing us with heavy weapons that we are able to fight this terrorist group			0

it was not clear how many @entity175 were missing			0
