by @entity0 published : 16:59 est , 23 november 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 23 november 2013 shamed @entity1 is said to have boasted that he ‘ often went for lunch ’ with senior @entity4 figures			1
the claim was made by a young male escort who says he met the @entity8 boss many times over the summer and was even invited by him to a party at the home of a @entity4 peer			1
@entity13 ’s alleged boast heaps more pressure on the party , which last week desperately tried to distance itself from its former ‘ favourite banker ’ as a slew of sleazy revelations followed our exclusive exposé of his drug abuse last week			2
general secretary @entity23 pictured with disgraced @entity1 who has claimed to have had lunch with senior @entity4 members the escort even said @entity1 had specifically identified @entity27 and @entity28 as the @entity4 figures he had lunched with – a claim that the party last night strongly denied			1
the new claim comes as @entity32 publishes photographs showing @entity13 and mr @entity28 at the same conference in 2010			1
both men were on the panel at the three - day @entity37			0
earlier this month , @entity1 told mps he helped to arrange a £ 50,000 donation by the @entity40 to the @entity42 ’s office			0
the former escort , who has found other work and does not want to be named , said : ‘ once [ @entity13 ] hit the cocaine , his mouth would go off and he would soon be boasting and dropping names of people who he said he knew and places he had been			0
‘ he told us he often went for lunch with @entity27 and @entity28 , and would speak about meeting important - sounding people in the @entity53 or for lunches in @entity55			1
’ in another astonishing claim , the escort said @entity1 , who was still chairman of the @entity58 when they met in april , admitted to being so hooked on class - a drugs that he had to snort cocaine to sit through lengthy bank board meetings at the @entity63 in @entity64			1
the political war of words over @entity1 intensified yesterday as the @entity67 reacted furiously to claims that they were conducting a ‘ smear campaign ’ over his links to the @entity4 leadership			1
@entity67 chairman @entity72 described @entity27 as ‘ pathetic ’ for claiming that the episode ‘ showed more about the character of the prime minister than about the character of @entity4 ’s relationship with the co-op ’ , and for accusing mr @entity78 of trying ‘ to make cheap political points rather than sorting it out ’			1
mr @entity72 said : ‘ this is a pathetic attempt to evade the serious issues			0
@entity4 have big questions to answer , and when they are asked , they simply try to avoid them by claiming they are smears			1
’ and he claimed mr @entity27 ’s remarks amounted to hypocrisy ‘ from the party that brought you the most disgraceful smear operation of modern times , fronted by @entity93 , and known about , encouraged and tolerated by @entity28 and @entity27 ’			1
‘ @entity94 was simply the latest in a long line of bullying @entity4 spin doctors , including @entity97 and @entity98 , ’ he added			1
‘ we suggest that they explain how the corruption at @entity102 happened , and how the @entity103 was allowed to become and remain an adviser , rather than dismiss legitimate questions as smears			1
’ the escort , who was only 19 during most of their relationship , said : ‘ as i got to know him , the scale of his dependency on drugs became clear			2
he could n’t get through the day without snorting some			0
‘ he told me bank board meetings were the worst and he would have a line at lunchtimes to keep him going through the afternoon session			1
’ the pair were introduced by another escort who had already begun having trysts with the @entity126 minister			0
the escort said : ‘ we first met at the @entity129 hotel in @entity64 , where he had a suite he used when he was in the city			0
‘ i wore a shirt and smart trousers , and he had on a polo shirt and chinos			0
he was very good company			0
he was well spoken and intelligent , and we were not short of conversation			0
a @entity4 spokesperson categorically denied that either @entity27 or @entity28 had lunch with the disgraced co-op bank chief ‘ we had a meal at the hotel and he told me that he was the chairman of the @entity58 but he was about to step down			1
he also said he was a @entity126 minister			0
‘ when i asked him what chairing a bank entailed , he was a bit short on detail and just said he was mostly a figurehead and not concerned with the actual running of it			2
‘ we were drinking white wine all evening and then went up to his suite			0
it was a very large room with a bed that he proudly told me could “ comfortably sleep three			0
” ’ he said they began to meet frequently , with @entity13 booking him for £ 400 - a - time ‘ overnight sessions ’ at his house in @entity156 , owned by the @entity157			0
it was at one of these gatherings that @entity1 apparently made the claim about his contact with mr @entity27 and mr @entity28			1
the political wing of the co-operative movement could be facing financial crisis of its own next year as the @entity167 ’s board reviews its £ 1million political fund			2
cutting the spending would deal a severe financial blow to the @entity171 , a sister group to the @entity4 , whose members include shadow chancellor @entity28 and 31 other @entity174			1
just two weeks ago the interim members meeting of the @entity40 – the parent company behind the funerals , supermarkets and banking businesses – voted in favour of a £ 1million fund for political donations in 2014			2
but with the group reeling from the @entity1 scandal , a strategic review is under way and a spokesman for the group confirmed political donations could be cut			0
‘ given there is a group - wide strategy review under way , it is safe to assume everything will be looked at			0
‘ in the case of political engagement , do we want to make donations to one political party ? , ’ said the spokesman			2
the way the money is dished out is left to the discretion of the @entity205 , but in previous years the vast bulk has gone to the @entity171			0
the political donations pot was also the source of the £ 50,000 given to @entity28 office by the co-op group last year			1
the @entity171 describes itself as @entity212 ’s ‘ fourth biggest political party ’ , although it only puts up candidates in partnership with the @entity4			1
its politicians , who also number @entity216 , @entity218 and @entity219 , style themselves as ‘ co-operative and @entity4 ’ mps			1
payouts to political groups will be doubly controversial in the coming year as the @entity40 battles to arrange a financial rescue for its struggling banking business , which could cost investors , including private individuals , thousands of pounds			0
‘ the comment about lunching with @entity27 and @entity28 was made at his house in @entity156			1
there was another escort there and another man who he had picked up for the night from the @entity234 [ gay dating mobile phone ] app. he loved an audience			2
‘ he seemed serious about his politics			0
at one of our meetings at the @entity129 hotel , i remarked that perhaps @entity4 had gone for the wrong brother for the leadership			1
he launched into a very forceful defence of @entity27 and promised me more than once that he would introduce me			1
he said i would change my mind if i met him			0
’ the escort said he was astonished by how unguarded @entity1 was about his drug use			0
‘ he was either very naive or he just thought different rules applied to him			0
most people use code when referring to drugs in text messages or on the phone , but he did n’t seem to care			0
‘ often i would go to bed and he would stay up			0
when i got up , the next day he would say that he had just been taking coke all night			0
the day after we went to see @entity260 at the @entity261 in @entity156 , he had three lines of coke and then went to take charge of a funeral			0
’ a spokesman for the co-op said he could not comment on claims that @entity1 had used drugs to get through board meetings			1
a @entity4 spokesman last night denied that @entity1 enjoyed lunch with either mr @entity27 or mr @entity28 : ‘ this is not true			1
@entity27 has met @entity1 on only three occasions			1
' they met in march this year and @entity1 also attended , along with other business people , two informal dinners at which @entity27 was a guest			2
@entity28 has been to a few events @entity1 was also at but he has never had a meeting or a phone conversation with him			2
‘ any attempt to suggest the behaviour of @entity1 calls into question the integrity of the @entity4 as a whole is an unjustified smear			2
the @entity4 leadership has been as shocked and appalled as anyone at the revelations regarding @entity13			2
' that is why we took immediate action to suspend him from @entity4 within hours of the revelations			2

shamed *reverend* said he ' often went for lunch ' with senior party members
*labour* leader @entity27 and shadow chancellor @entity28 mentioned in boasts
the @entity4 has categorically denied claims @entity103 ever had lunch with either man
