he was later charged with immoral and indecent acts with a child over the alleged sexual assaults , two of which reportedly occurred against two boys at @entity19 in 1962 and ' 85			1

former camp counselor : @entity9 ( pictured in his police mugshot ) , 94 , who is charged with multiple sex crimes against children , may have abused a staggering 100 youngsters , a new memo has suggested after he was charged , @entity9 's former employer , @entity30 36 , released hundreds of pages of his personnel records , some indicating school officials knew of his alleged crimes decades ago			1
but now , a handwritten page dated 1995 - a decade after @entity9 left his job at @entity37 's @entity38 - has been unearthed that suggests there may have been up to 100 victims			1
the memo , written during the tenure of then - superintendent @entity44 , includes the shocking phrase : ' could have 100 children abused ' , according to the @entity47			1
it also features references to the @entity51 state 's attorney and school lawyers , as well as phrases that apparently read : ' letting sleeping dogs lie may be more helpful ' and ' no proof '			0
although the page appears to describe the @entity59 's reaction to the allegations made against @entity9 , it remains unclear who wrote the memo , who it was written for , nor why it was written			2
' we are not in a position to comment on or interpret documents prepared by others almost 20 years ago , ' district attorney , @entity65 , told the newspaper			0
scene : @entity9 was arrested at his retirement community after allegedly abusing two boys and one girl			1
two of the assaults reportedly occurred at @entity19 ( pictured ) in @entity8 and 1985 but former school board member @entity77 , who was on the board when the memo was apparently penned , described the possibility of up to 100 child victims was upsetting			1
' it 's very unnerving to hear that , ' she said , explaining that she was not previously aware of the page 's existence			0
' and to think he spent so many years ( as a teacher )			0
' earlier this month , it was revealed that the state of @entity8 is seeking to have @entity9 sent from @entity91 to face the sexual assault charges against him			2
on december 4 , a @entity94 judge ruled the pensioner - who was arrested on september 23 - must undergo a competency evaluation before any extradition hearing can be held			1
' could have 100 children abused ' ' letting sleeping dogs lie may be more helpful ' ' no obligation to inform - not in employ currently ' ' statute of limitations anyway ' according to his attorney , @entity102 , @entity9 is gravely ill ; he apparently suffers from heart failure and uses an oxygen tank to breathe in home confinement at his hospice			1
' we need to determine whether or not he is able to recall whether he was present in the state of @entity8 at the time of the alleged crimes , ' mr @entity102 told @entity111			2
meanwhile , @entity115 sheriff 's detective @entity114 and county prosecutor @entity113 , citing state law , said they could not discuss the case or charges against @entity9			2
the charges stem from information investigators received in february about abuse at the @entity19 , according to an affidavit filed in @entity122			0
one former scout claimed he was molested aged 13 by @entity9 in a bunk - style cabin at the camp in 1962 , adding that he had initially brought the alleged assault up in the late 1960s			1
he thought he ' had communicated ' to an assistant @entity128 leader at the time who he knew about the accusations and had been ' hurt ' , the affidavit said			0
the man , now aged 65 , told investigators ' he never heard the @entity128 ... did anything about the accusation at that time , ' it added			0
but @entity138 spokesman , @entity137 , argued that the group was not aware of the allegations against @entity9 until earlier this year			2
hospice : according to @entity9 's attorney , @entity102 , the pensioner suffers from heart failure and uses an oxygen tank to breathe in home confinement at the @entity6 and @entity147 ( pictured ) ' while this individual was last involved in @entity150 in 1988 , when we received notice of alleged abuse this year we reported it to law enforcement officials in @entity8 and @entity155 and have assisted them in their investigation , ' mr @entity137 said			1
he added that the organization has developed and enhanced its efforts to protect its young members in the decades since the alleged incidents took place			2
last month , a woman also told investigators that she was kissed and fondled by @entity9 during an overnight camping trip at @entity23 when she was just 14 years old			0
and last february , another former scout who spent five weeks at @entity19 in 1985 told police he was molested on at least six occasions by @entity168 in the cabin he shared other boys			0
in october , the @entity30 school district released @entity9 's personnel records following a police investigation , saying : ' we believe it is our responsibility to be forthcoming with the community			1
' a spokesman added : ' we want potential victims to know how seriously this @entity179 takes these issues			0
' however , attorney @entity181 , who represents an alleged victim , questioned why the district seemingly did not do more to report claims against @entity9 to authorities - even after his retirement			1
' what 's shocking is , even when a person is gone and no longer a present danger to the organization , it 's very myopic thinking , because they could be harming other children somewhere else , ' mr @entity181 told the @entity47			0
@entity9 worked as a physical education teacher at @entity195 in @entity30 , @entity155 , a suburb north of @entity196 , from 1949 to 1985			2
he also worked at @entity19 in @entity197 , @entity8 , every summer until 2002 , according to a lawyer for the camp			2
earlier this year , the @entity201 board wrote in a letter to families and campers that the camp was under different owners at the time of the alleged abuse			0
the camp had operated in @entity197 from 1939 to 2000 , according to court documents			0
it was later sold and moved to @entity212			0
' we do n't have a lot of additional information , ' the letter read			0
' what we do know is that , as an organization dedicated to the development and care of children , we seek and support justice for any person or persons who may have been harmed and lived with this for decades			0
' it is unknown whether @entity9 has yet undergone the competency evaluation .			1
