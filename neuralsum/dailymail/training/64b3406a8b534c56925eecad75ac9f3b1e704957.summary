by @entity0 on monday , a resident of @entity2 in south - eastern @entity3 said she saw a column of armored vehicles approach the town and start shooting			1
' it all started at 8am this morning , tanks appeared , no fewer than seven of them , ' the woman , who gave her name only as @entity13 , told @entity14 by telephone			0
' right now i can hear rumbling , explosions ... the residents are hiding			0
' in @entity22 later that morning , @entity3 officials said the column was an incursion by @entity20 troops which it alleges are fighting alongside @entity27 separatists , a claim @entity20 quickly dismissed as disinformation			1
with the battlefield mostly too dangerous for reporters to safely move around , verifying who is doing what is usually impossible			0
on tuesday , in a continuation of the pattern , @entity22 said it had captured a group of @entity20 soldiers who had entered @entity3 on a ' special mission ' , while @entity54 said they were there by mistake			1
however , the armored column that appeared on monday in the far south - eastern corner of @entity3 , where it abuts the @entity20 border , was unusual because the spot was far removed from any territory held by the separatists			1
it was therefore difficult to see how the column could have appeared in @entity3 without having come across the @entity20 border , unless it made an amphibious landing from the nearby @entity66 which is improbable given the number of heavy vehicles witnesses said they saw			1
a @entity14 reporter was able to observe the situation in the area where the column was seen , first at the start of august and then most recently on sunday afternoon , a few hours before the first sightings of the column were reported			2
those observations , combined with interviews with rebel leaders , @entity3 soldiers , and other research , indicated two things			1
it is difficult to see how the column could have appeared in @entity3 without having come across the @entity20 border before the armored column appeared , the area had come under artillery fire it was not possible to establish whether the people driving the column and firing the artillery were @entity20 soldiers or separatist rebels first , that until late on sunday there were no rebel formations within about 30 km ( 20 miles ) of the area where the armored column first appeared , and had not been for weeks beforehand			1
and secondly , that before the armored column appeared , the area had come under artillery fire at times when the nearest rebel positions were beyond the range of most types of weapon that could have delivered the strike			2
it was not possible to establish whether the people driving the column and firing the artillery were @entity20 soldiers or separatist rebels			1
but there were strong indications that whoever it was doing those things operated out of @entity20 territory - something very unlikely to have happened without @entity54 's consent			1
@entity3 soldiers sit in a military camp near @entity118 , @entity3 a @entity3 soldier looks through his binoculars at a military camp near @entity118 , @entity3 fighting a civil war : @entity3 soldiers eat at a military camp near @entity118 , @entity3 the question of @entity20 involvement is at the core of @entity129 governments ' response to the @entity3 crisis , and could be crucial to how the conflict plays out			1
the @entity132 and @entity133 have already imposed sanctions on @entity20 in part based on allegations @entity54 is arming the rebels			1
the @entity129 has warned of more sanctions if @entity20 provides further help			1
a @entity3 national guard unit stationed on the outskirts of @entity2 , on the road towards the @entity145 - @entity144 border crossing , showed a @entity14 reporter a crater left by an exploding munition near their position			1
they said the artillery fire was coming from over the border inside @entity20 , about 10 km ( six miles ) to the east			1
' there were about 500 salvos from @entity157 ( multiple rocket system ) and mortars			0
there have been and are no rebels here whatsoever			0
they 're just firing straight from @entity20 , ' @entity162 , the commander of a @entity3 national guard unit , said on sunday , before the armored column appeared in the same area			1
@entity14 saw no direct evidence of this , and @entity20 officials have repeatedly denied that their military is in any way involved in the conflict in eastern @entity3 , between @entity27 separatist rebels and government forces			1
a spokesman for the @entity20 border guard service , when asked to comment , said : ' this is stupid			1
@entity20 does n't fire at anyone			1
' the @entity20 defense ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment			2
but with no rebel presence within range inside @entity3 , it was not clear what other source there could have been for the artillery fire			2
even if rebels has somehow snuck into the area and fired the artillery , it seemed impossible they could have done that without using @entity20 territory to move about , given the distance from the nearest rebel - held locations			2
a @entity3 soldier prepares a gun close to a military camp near @entity118 , @entity3 the crater seen by the @entity14 reporter on sunday , before the clashes with rebels , was in the corner of a field behind a defensive trench dug by the @entity3 national guard unit			2
a metal fragment that appeared to come from a munition was found in the hole			0
@entity14 showed the photographs of the crater to four @entity212 weapons experts who said the crater was either made by an artillery rocket , most probably a @entity157 , or by a shell from a self - propelled 122 mm gun			0
according to one of the experts , @entity219 , @entity212 and @entity222 armed forces analyst with @entity223 , a consultancy , the maximum range for the @entity226 , the @entity228 - designed self - propelled 122 mm gun in use in @entity231 states , is 15.3 km. that is extendable to 21.9 km when rocket - assisted projectiles are used , he said			0
@entity219 said the maximum range for the most commonly used @entity157 , designated as @entity235 , was 20.33 km. he said other variants have ranges of up to 40 km , but they are less widespread			0
the rebels ' self - proclaimed @entity239 ( @entity241 ) says its forces are pushing south from their main stronghold in the city @entity245 , but the settlements they said they had taken by monday which were closest to the @entity145 - @entity144 crossing were @entity248 , about 30 km ( 20 miles ) away as the crow flies , and @entity250 , about 60 km ( 40 miles ) away			0
that may have overstated the rebels ' reach : a @entity14 reporter who drove through @entity248 twice on sunday saw no sign of a rebel presence in or near the town			0
one of the experts who reviewed the photographs , @entity261 - based independent weapons researcher @entity260 , said he believed the crater was caused by a grad rocket			0
he said the shape of the crater suggested the munition was fired from the north - east , the direction of the border with @entity20			2
the @entity3 unit said most of the artillery struck in the area between their post and the border			2
@entity14 was unable to inspect the other craters left behind by the strikes because of the risk the artillery fire could start up again			0
members of the unit said @entity20 artillery had been landing on the @entity3 side overnight from thursday to friday , and again on friday night			1
on a previous visit to the area , on august 1			0
@entity3 border guards at the crossing point between @entity20 and @entity3 showed a @entity14 reporter broken windows and holes in the roof of their building			1
they said the damage was caused by mortar rounds fired from @entity20 territory			2
' there is n't a single insurgent around here for 50 km , ' said one of the border guards , @entity296			0
' a mortar can travel 6 ( km )			0
' asked by @entity14 on monday how the rebels could fire artillery so far from their positions , @entity298 , @entity241 deputy prime minister , said : ' in the conditions of modern warfare , 20 km is no kind of distance for artillery			0
' ' this is not a war of fronts , it 's a civil war			0
movements of troops can take place here practically instantaneously			2
all of us here are insurgents			0
you come home , you grab your weapons and you go and shoot			0
