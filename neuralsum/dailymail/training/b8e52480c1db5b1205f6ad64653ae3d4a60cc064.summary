a rape victim is carrying her dorm - room mattress with her everywhere she goes to protest the inaction by school administrators in bringing her attacker to justice			1
@entity7 senior @entity6 is carrying the mattress as part of her senior thesis art project , and will only stop once when her rapist is no longer enrolled in school			1
@entity6 points out that the project - which she is calling ' @entity14 ' or ' @entity15 ' - could last as little as one day , or continue until she graduates this spring			1
the mattress represents her specific rape , since she was attacked in her dorm room			0
the weight of carrying it around also visualizes how she continues to be haunted by the experience			0
@entity6 plans to spread information about the project via word of mouth , and says one of the rules is that she ca n't ask for help with carrying the mattress			1
however , anyone can ask to help her and she thinks this will be one way of spreading the project to her college community			0
last may , @entity6 reported the scarring experiencing to police , a year and a half after the incident happened			1
she says the incident was so damaging , she initially decided not to go to authorities because she was afraid and ashamed of what had happened			0
' when it first happened , i did n’t want to talk to anyone			0
i did n’t even tell my parents			0
... i did n’t even want to talk to my best friend , ' she said			0
the student newspaper has identified the student accused of the rape , but since no charges have been filed , @entity62 is not naming the man			1
weighed down : @entity6 will continues to carry the mattress until her rapist is no longer on campus			1
she says this might take only one day or last the rest of the year however , he is one of a handful of students who have been accused of sexually assaulting multiple classmates on campus , in lists graffitied on bathroom stalls and distributed in pamphlets			2
@entity6 recounted the incident to the student newspaper , saying it came as a surprise since she had consensual sex with the attacker twice before			1
scarred : @entity6 initially did n't come forward to police because she was scared and ashamed of the attack on august 27 , 2012 , the two were hanging out in her dorm room when things took a violent turn			2
according to the police report , @entity6 said her attacker suddenly hit her across the face then ' choked her , and pushed her knees onto her chest and leaned on her knees to keep them up			1
' he went on to grab her ' wrists and penetrated her anally '			0
@entity6 told her attacker to stop , but he continued raping her until he ' suddenly stopped without ejaculating '			2
while she did n't report the incident to police at first , she and two other victims of the same man reported him to school officials the following spring			2
administrators held a hearing on the matter but eventually found the student in question ' not responsible '			0
the experience of reporting the rape to police was just as terrible an experience for @entity6 as well			2
officers showed up to take her statement at her dorm room on may 14 , and she says they were dismissive and questioning of her account - especially the fact that she had slept with her attacker before and could n't recall minute details of the incident			0
she was then asked to go to the police station and fill out more paperwork , with one document describing the attack as ' domestic violence ' even though she was never in a relationship with her rapist			2
while she was speaking with the @entity129 , the officer who took her statement continued to talk with her friends at the station , saying he did n't buy her story			0
police have passed the case along to the @entity136 , and while @entity6 believes it may be too late to bring up charges against her attacker , she still hopes for justice .			1

@entity6 was raped nearly two years ago , when she was a *sophomore* at @entity7
she reported her rapist , a fellow student , to police and the *university* but so far charges have not been filed and he remains on campus
now a senior , @entity6 is performing an art project for her thesis in which she will carry around a mattress every day her attacker remains at school
