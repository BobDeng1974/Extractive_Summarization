by @entity1 reporter parents and teachers are rallying around a @entity5 high school wrestling coach put on leave after video emerged of him using wrestling moves to try to subdue a male student			1
@entity10 had been teaching his science class when it allegedly came to his attention that the unnamed student had drugs in his possession			1
a confrontation ensued and video shows what happened thereafter , but what seems like a case of a teacher going too far has some of @entity23 's colleagues cheering him on			1
' one supporter , who identified himself on @entity33 as former @entity38 administrator @entity37 , wrote that @entity23 did the right thing			2
' if you had a child in this class and another student was selling drug [ s ] in clear view , you would want any teacher to do what @entity10 did , ' @entity37 wrote			1
' he did in fact try to resolve this situation peacefully by asking the student to turn over the drugs to him			2
the student resisted and became aggressive … support this great teacher and wonderful person			0
he needs us at this time			0
' a former student also wrote in to support @entity23 , the @entity56 reported			1
' you should all know that i lost my father when i was quite young , ' the student wrote			0

he 's kept kids off the streets , gotten others into college , and shaped the lives of so many others throughout his long service to this community			0
when you continue to hear about this story , and hear people try to defend the student or attack coach black , i beg of you to speak out against their false accusations			2

' at the heart of the confrontation was the student 's alleged marijuana possession			1
' the little boy was selling drugs in class , ' student @entity94 told @entity98			1
' the wrestling coach told him to stop ... i guess he did n't listen and tables were thrown			0
' there were no punches thrown , no kicking , and no yelling during the altercation			0
however , @entity23 was suspended even before an investigation was conducted			1
@entity77 said that an automatic suspension before investigation was standard school policy and in no way meant that the outcome was predetermined			0
@entity77 also later apologized for her initial remarks about @entity23 , acknowledging to the that her statement showed ' pre-judgement ' in a letter sent out this weekend			0
' there is also concern about my failure to address the conduct of one or more students who were involved in the incident			0
in retrospect , i understand how my statement has created these concerns , ' @entity77 said , the @entity56 reported			0
these facts , paired with the student 's alleged illegal activities have some area students , teachers and parents flocking to @entity23 's side			1
