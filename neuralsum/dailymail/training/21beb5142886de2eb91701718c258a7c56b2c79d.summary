by @entity0 addictive : text messages took the world by storm in 1998 , but less than two decades later it is in decline as new forms of messaging have become more popular a revolutionary form of communication is in decline - just 20 years after it changed the way that people interact with each other			1
used by four billion people around the world , the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) took the world by storm after its birth in december 1992			1
but after two decades of fervently bashing keypads with our thumbs , media watchdog @entity19 has reported a decline in the volume of texts sent			1
the number of text messages sent in @entity28 peaked at 39.7billion at the end of last year , but is now down to 38.5billion , following two quarterly declines			1
the fall has been attributed to new forms of communication which have taken over from the basic @entity15 system			2
owners of modern smartphones now have a plethora of ways of communicating with each other - including @entity40 and instant messaging			1
the first ever text - sent in december 1992 - simply read ' @entity43 ' , after being sent by engineer @entity44 from his personal computer to @entity47 's @entity46			1
this humble beginning kicked off a cultural and social revolution in the developed world , and texts have been used to seal business deals and even convey marriage proposals			1
advanced : many mobile phones now use the internet and their owners have more choice in how to communicate with friends and contacts , including @entity40 and instant messaging the trend of texting exploded among children in 1998 with the introduction of the ' pay as you go ' system by four major phone companies			1
but it was only in 1999 that texting became a way of life when users could start sending text messages to people using different mobile networks to their own			0
texts soon completely transformed the way we write by introducing new abbreviations to the @entity81 language now known as ' text speak '			1
today is the 20th anniversary of the first ever text message			0
it was sent by 22 - year - old engineer @entity44 , pictured right , on december 3 , 1992 , whom was sitting at a computer terminal in @entity47 's @entity88 where his colleague were enjoying their @entity43 party			1
he had to type the text on a computer before sending it because mobile phones did not keyboards - these were not developed until 1997			2
his text to the company 's technical director @entity46 ' @entity100 mobile phone simply read ' @entity43 '			0
originally intended as a pager for contacting people on the road , the first text message spawned a revolution in communication			0
but it was not until 1999 that messages could be sent and received between different networks			0
although a first , the concept of text messages had been developed eight years earlier by the @entity113 corporation			0
since the mr @entity44 's pioneering text , sms - or short message service - has taken over the world			2
it has been used to organise revolutions during the @entity119 and to coordinate relief efforts and raise money for survivors of natural disasters such as the @entity124 and the @entity126 earthquakes			0
with 150 billion text messages sent last year in the @entity28 - almost triple the number sent in 2006 - texting became the most common form of communication			1
it is called short message service because in @entity81 a text can only have 140 characters			0
in other alphabets , such as @entity137 , texts can only have 70 characters			2
the average 12 to 15 - year - old send 193 texts a week and politicians have blamed the abbreviated language on the demise of literacy among the youth as punctuation , grammar and capitalisation are largely ignored in favour of brevity			1
text messages sent around the world now generates Â£ 73.5billion a year with the average @entity152 sending 50 texts a week			1
it gave rise to a number of new challenges for modern society , including bullying , the dangers of texting while driving and ' sexting ' - where sexually explicit photographs or messages are sent by mobile phone			1
as well as giving bullies an easy way to torment their victims out of school , the trend of sexting among teens has also caused concern			0
a 2008 survey by @entity173 to prevent teen and @entity175 found one in five teen girls surveyed admitted to electronically sending nude or semi-nude images of themselves			0
one - third of teen boys and one - quarter of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi-nude images			2
according to the survey , sexually suggestive messages sent by text , e-mail , and instant messaging were even more common than images			1
nearly 40 per cent of teens admitted to having sent or posted such messages , and half of teens have received them			0
more recently , a 2012 study by the @entity194 @entity193 found nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves on their mobile			0
@entity199 , @entity19 's director of research , told @entity200 : ' for the first time in the history of mobile phones , @entity15 volumes are showing signs of decline			0
' the availability of a wider range of communications tools , like instant messaging and social networking sites , means people might be sending fewer sms messages , but they are communicating electronically more than ever before			1
' while texting might be on decline in favour of alternative - and often cheaper - forms of electronic communication , experts warn that it is our personal relationships that are really at risk			1
ironically , a new study has found that while electronic communication has made it easier than ever for people to stay in touch , it has actually started to erode out ability to communicate with others			0
the communication revolution : the average @entity152 sends 50 texts a week while average teenagers send 193 texts a week here are just a selection of the most common words that have infiltrated not just the way we write but also the way we speak : @entity242 out loud @entity244 - to be honest @entity243 for @entity245 on the floor laughing @entity247 , sex , location @entity250 friends forever asap - as soon as possible @entity252 my a * * off @entity254 of missing out @entity255 - thanks @entity256 - you only live once srsly - seriously @entity258 - are you @entity259 ta for now @entity260 - at the moment fyi - for your information @entity261 - before pov - point of view @entity264 - away from keyboard @entity266 - later ttyl - talk to you later @entity263 and kisses and it revealed that texting has become as addictive as compulsive spending for many			1
study author dr @entity272 said : ' mobile phones are a part of our consumer culture			0
' they are not just a consumer tool , but are used as a status symbol			0
they 're also eroding our personal relationships			0
' previous studies have revealed young adults send on average 109.5 texts a day , or approximately 3,200 messages a month			2
they receive an additional 113 texts and check their phones 60 times in a typical day and students spend about seven hours a day interacting with information and communication technology			2
dr @entity272 added : ' at first glance , one might have the tendency to dismiss such aberrant mobile phone use as merely youthful nonsense - a passing fad			2
' but an emerging body of literature has given increasing credence to cell phone addiction and similar behavioural addictions			0
' new trends : but experts fear that the increased use of electronic communication is causing people to lose the ability to communicate with others in person			2

number of texts sent annually has fallen by one billion since last year
experts say new ways of communicating - such as @entity40 and instant messaging - are taking over
