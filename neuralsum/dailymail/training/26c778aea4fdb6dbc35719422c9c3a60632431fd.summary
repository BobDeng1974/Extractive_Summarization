by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 20:51 est , 24 november 2013 work on the @entity4 railway will begin in just four months , transport secretary @entity1 promised yesterday			2
a @entity5 paving the way for the £ 50billion link to be built is to be published today and the cabinet minister pledged to face down the scheme ’s critics			1
opponents will still have a chance to petition @entity13 and have their case heard by a committee of @entity16			1
despite this concession , mr @entity1 said work would be starting early next spring			0
prime minister @entity19 received a declaration of support for @entity4 from leaders and representatives of the @entity25 's ten largest cities outside of @entity26 a few days ago			1
supporters hope to see a new high - speed line running from @entity26 to @entity29 by 2026 preliminary contracts worth up to £ 60million can now be handed out , though further legal hurdles remain before the actual railway can go ahead			1
‘ @entity4 is the most ambitious and important infrastructure project in the @entity25 since we built the @entity37 30 years ago , and in 30 more it will be just as integral a part of the nation ’s prosperity , ’ mr @entity33 told the @entity34 on sunday			1
he added that people had previously opposed large projects such as the @entity37 and the @entity43 but public opinion had eventually changed in support			1
‘ we ca n’t let the opponents who have learned nothing from the past strangle our future growth			2
i will not let the naysayers drag this country down			0
’ mr @entity1 said @entity4 would create 22,000 jobs in the next five years and revitalise towns along its 351 - mile route			2
but opponents of the £ 50 billion @entity4 high - speed rail project are to demonstrate in @entity57 as an @entity58 begins its passage through @entity13			1
the protest today is being organised by the @entity4 group with demonstrators expected to come from as far away at @entity63 and @entity64			2
mr @entity1 will give evidence before the @entity66 on tuesday , as will chiefs at auditing firm @entity68 , which has claimed @entity4 would boost the economy by £ 15billion a year			2
however , transport economists told the committee they disagreed with the £ 15billion prediction , with one saying the key calculation behind the figure was ' essentially made up '			0
opposition to @entity4 has been vociferous and transport experts and economists have poured doubt on its forecasted economic benefit a ' paving ' bill - officially called the @entity81 ( preparation ) @entity5 - received royal assent last week and has kick - started the legislation that supporters hope will see a new high - speed line running through @entity88 heartlands in the @entity89 from @entity26 to @entity29 by 2026			1
a second phase , taking the line to north west and north east @entity92 , is due for completion in 2032/33			0
the cost of the project is now put at £ 42.6billion with a further £ 7.5billion for the trains			0
ahead of the @entity57 protest , @entity4 campaign manager @entity97 said : ' with the widespread criticism of @entity4 from independent bodies , it is quite depressing that @entity16 and @entity102 speaking for the project recently are so ill - informed and unwilling to listen to the exceptionally sound arguments which make it clear @entity4 should not go ahead			2
' on monday , people from up and down the @entity4 route will descend on to @entity13 , not to say they do n't want @entity4 to come near their homes , but to say that they have studied the plans and justifications for @entity4 and that it should be scrapped completely			1
' it is sad that people in affected communities know more about @entity4 than the majority of @entity114 know about what @entity4 means , and we hope to change that			0
' @entity118 , general secretary of train drivers ' union @entity119 , has welcomed publication of the @entity58			2
he said : ' we believe @entity25 needs not only a new high speed rail line but a high speed rail network			1
the @entity66 will be taking evidence from transport secretary @entity1 on tuesday ' we would , ideally , like to see @entity4 run the length of the @entity25 , being built from @entity127 and the south at the same time , meeting in the middle , linking @entity130 ( the @entity43 high - speed link ) and going via @entity132			1
' the number of passengers on our railways has doubled since 1995 while rail freight traffic has risen by 65 per cent over the same period			0
' the existing rail network is operating at near full capacity and neither new motorways nor domestic air travel are environmentally sustainable options to meet the mobility requirements of a @entity25 population expected to grow by 10 million by 2033			1
' last week a report by a business group in @entity146 in north @entity26 claimed @entity4 would mean big job and economic losses in an area which boasts some of @entity26 's top markets			0
this was refuted by @entity152 today @entity146 council said : ' as a council we are opposed to the specific @entity4 proposals because of the damage the scheme would do to our community in lost jobs , demolished or heavily impacted houses , threatened schools , shut down businesses			2
' there is simply no business case for the @entity130 / @entity4 link up , but it would cause substantial damage to the @entity169 area			0
' the merits of @entity4 have been debated amid more antagonism and vitriol than those with long associations with transport projects can remember			0
@entity180 , although appearing to be cooling towards the project amid concerns at its high cost , seem to be supporting it in @entity13 even though former @entity180 cabinet ministers @entity181 and @entity183 have expressed reservations			1
@entity152 spokesman @entity185 said : ' @entity4 is the country 's largest ever project			0
as such it warrants debate			0
however we must be clear that @entity152 will yield hugely significant benefits while addressing the cripplingly strained transport network			0
' those that oppose @entity4 are risking the very future of the country			0
' an @entity4 proposed train design			0
supporters say the scheme will revitalise the @entity25 transport system			1

' paving ' bill for *controversial* high - speed train will be published today
but protestors from all over the @entity25 plan to descend on @entity13 today to voice their concerns
supporters say scheme is vital for economy and future infrastructure comparing it the the @entity37 and the @entity43
