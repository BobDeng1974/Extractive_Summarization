by @entity0 a humble bungalow which a family bought for just £ 1,000 almost a century ago has been turned into a luxury holiday home worth £ 5million			1
dr @entity4 paid just £ 40,000 in today 's money for the home on @entity9 's @entity8 peninsula , an exposed spit in @entity11 which many people feared would be too unstable to live on			1
but the home soared in value as the tiny enclave 's popularity soared , becoming what is now the fourth most expensive property hotspot in the world			1
the way we were : this is the humble bungalow bought for just £ 1,000 in the 1920s on the prime @entity8 peninsula in @entity9			1
the site is now worth £ 5million luxury : the bungalow , bought by the current owner 's great - grandfather , was demolished and replaced with this luxury seven - bedroom house which is let out to holidaymakers for £ 4,000 a week			1
owner @entity32 said he will bring his 10 - month - old daughter to the house to have the same experiences he did as a child history : the peninsula and its modest huts around 100 years ago in a postcard			1
@entity32 's great - grandfather bought his bungalow for just £ 1,000 in the 1920s idyll : the approximate location of the house on the peninsula , whose millionaire residents include @entity51 manager @entity50 and @entity53 manager @entity52 desirable : houses began to be built on the spit in the late 1800s , but the current boom only took off in the 1960s			1
pictured : a plan of the area from 1896 the bolthole was passed down through four generations of the same family until it fell into a state of disrepair			0
in 2011 dr @entity4 ’s great - grandson , @entity32 , and his father @entity65 , made the drastic decision to demolish the 90 - year - old home and erect a new one in its place			1
they spent £ 580,000 creating a luxurious beachfront house that is now worth 5,000 times ( 500,000 per cent ) more than the original holiday home			1
the two - storey property , named @entity75 after the old bungalow , has seven bedrooms and five bathrooms			2
it is clad in larch wood , powered by solar panels and has a garden that backs onto the beach			0
interior designer mr @entity32 , 33 , from @entity84 , rents the house to holidaymakers from april to october each year for up to £ 4,100 a week			2
he said : ' for the last 90 years the bungalow has been in my family			0
it was originally purchased by my great grandfather , so that there was a place that everyone could go on holiday together			0
@entity96 : the luxury home is now available to rent for up to £ 4,000 a week - four times more than the amount the plot was originally bought for in the 1920s luxurious : @entity8 , a spit measuring less than half a square mile and jutting into @entity11 , has the fourth - highest land value in the world @entity106 : but many people were unwilling to move into homes on the peninsula in the early 1900s because they were concerned about the stability of the land ' it was a much loved place and i have good memories of spending every summer there as a child , and it was n’t for a long time that i had a holiday abroad			1
' it has been passed through my family and over the years it has had various additions and alterations and was rather like patch work			0
' there was no central heating in the bungalow which was difficult in the colder months and we wanted a house that could be used year round			0
“ we decided that instead of trying to fix the various problems that there were with the house , that we should take it to the ground and build it back up			0
' it was a very special place to me and when the bulldozers came in and the house came down i thought i would be a lot sadder , but it ’s all about the location and the views			0
' we wanted to create a contemporary house that was going to last for another 100 years			0
' i ’m really looking forward to taking my daughter , who is 10 months old , to the property for holidays so she can do the same things i did as a child			1
' houses were first built on @entity8 in the late 19th century , but it was not always such a popular place to live			2
luxurious : @entity8 as the area is today			0
last month an old bungalow which would be worth just £ 200,000 elsewhere went on the market for £ 2.25million @entity152 view : once a humble holiday bungalow , the sprawling seven - bedroom luxury house looks out over the @entity155 and a secluded beach £ 1,000 was a common sale price for houses there despite the average price of a five - bed family home being more than double that ( £ 2,074 ) in 1930			2
even a three - bed semi was more expensive at £ 1,192			2
only in a property boom in the 1960s did the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built - up , turning into a @entity167 filled with luxury beachfront mansions			1
@entity8 is home to @entity51 manager @entity50 , @entity53 manager @entity52 and computer magnate sir @entity170			2
last month a tatty 1950s three - bedroom @entity8 bungalow which would be worth just £ 200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye - watering £ 2.25million			2
and in march , an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £ 3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down			0
@entity184 , of @entity183 , said : ' if this property was to come onto the market we would look to market it at circa five million pounds			0
' a lot of the plots in @entity8 were purchased for less than 1,000 pounds in the early 1900s			0

@entity192 bought *cheaply* in 1920s on @entity9 's @entity8 , when it was feared *surface* was too unstable to live on
