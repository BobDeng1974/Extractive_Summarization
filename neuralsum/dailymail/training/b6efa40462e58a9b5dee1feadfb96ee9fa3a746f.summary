@entity0 are considering the option of resting @entity2 for their @entity4 group encounter with @entity5 in @entity6 next week			1
if they kick off their tournament campaign with a win against @entity11 on sunday , they could take the decision conscious that @entity14 ’s @entity13 has struggled to recover from an almost identical knee injury			1
sources in @entity0 already believe that @entity2 is unlikely to face the @entity17 in the opening game for @entity20 ’s team			2
recovering : but @entity2 may not feature against @entity5 next week in @entity6 nutted : @entity2 joins his @entity0 team - mates for a training session keepy ups : @entity24 controlling the ball at a practice session last hurrah : and the @entity28 winner from the last @entity4 , @entity29 , is also involved learning : @entity14 's @entity13 has struggled to recover from an almost identical injury but only if they failed to take three points this weekend would they feel it necessary to rush @entity2 back for what would then be a key clash against @entity38 ’s side			1
the fact is there is an acute awareness in the @entity43 camp of the crisis which has hit @entity14 after they brought back @entity13 , the @entity46 midfielder , too early			1
the 27 - year - old underwent knee surgery in early may to repair a meniscus – the same knee condition which saw @entity50 striker @entity2 break down in @entity0 training and require an operation			1
there were confident claims from @entity55 that @entity13 would be back for the @entity4			2
but a surprise 15 - minute appearance in a friendly against @entity59 in @entity60 on may 30 proved disastrous			0
@entity13 ’s knee swelled badly and now his hopes of appearing for the @entity63 here in @entity65 are in serious doubt			2
easing him in : @entity2 has been taking part in some light ball work at training this week @entity13 is as important to @entity14 – who face a tough group with @entity72 and the @entity73 - as @entity2 is to @entity0			1
@entity0 coach @entity74 said : ‘ we have no set deadlines with @entity2			0
i do n’t know if we ’ll have him for the first match , for the second , for the third			0
if it were up to me , @entity2 would play tomorrow			0
’ @entity2 has trained alone at @entity0 ’s @entity81 base this week			0
he has worked with the ball , taking soft shots and short passes with his right leg but as yet has not put his left leg under any real strain .			0
