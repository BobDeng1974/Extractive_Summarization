to test this , clinical strains of 2009 pandemic @entity46 were used as a prototype virus to demonstrate @entity32 's anti-infective activity in cell culture assays			0
dr @entity19 said : ' the glycerine and xanthan gum prevent the germs from entering a person 's system and the @entity42 kills the germs once they 're trapped there			2
