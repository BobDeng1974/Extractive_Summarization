' cold towel sir ? ' asked a petite @entity1 as i stepped onto the jetty of the @entity4 in the @entity5			1
it was the fourth cold towel in as many hours			2
reaching my overwater bungalow , i kicked off my shoes , changed into swimming shorts and perused the room			2
it was posh - rustic with ethnic wood carvings , semi-outdoor shower and a glorious terrace poised over the turquoise sea			1
i walked down my personal steps , under my personal rainforest shower , and swam in my personal @entity18			2
a small shark swaggered by , angelfish darted off and the ripples of white sand felt indulgent under foot			2
a little piece of paradise : the @entity4 does the idea of all - inclusive with a little dash of style back in my room , i grabbed a beer from the minibar			1
' i know , ' i thought , ' i 'll walk around the island			2
' twenty minutes later , i 'd explored the thatched main restaurant and circled the island			2
back in my room , i sought a new distraction in a can of @entity36 and some crisps			0
then i read pages on the @entity39 about @entity41 's all - inclusive package			1
no more wristbands , house plonk and sky - high mini-bar prices ; just fine cuisine , premium brand beers and spirits and wine from @entity50			1
after that , i padded barefoot to the @entity53 bar to put it to the test			0
at the cute beachside hangout , i polished off a draught @entity58 beer and more nibbles , then made a pen - on - the - palm gesture to the barman			1
he wobbled his head politely : ' there is nothing to sign , sir			0
' there was nothing to sign in the restaurants either , where i ceased being sniffy about ' all - inclusive ' on my second helping of sashimi			1
smells to swoon over wafted across the @entity75 restaurant from the grill hut			0
the buffet brimmed with sushi and salads , and mains such as @entity82 green chicken curry , @entity84 lamb , and reef fish with tarragon			0
to my surprise , the three novels i 'd packed went unread			0
instead i joined a yoga class , drank some @entity90 , had a massage looking down at fish swimming under the treatment hut , drank some more @entity94 and took a sunset cruise in a traditional dhoni			1
i had a try - dive too , right off the jetty , and explored the incredible house reef with just a few lazy flicks of my fins			1
i paddled a kayak , enjoyed a wine tasting , and went on a boat trip to the neighbouring island of @entity106 ( population 750 )			0
scarcely dull : @entity108 was worried that he would be bored in the @entity5 - but found plenty to do here , sparky local lad @entity110 showed me his 314 - year - old mosque and the banyan tree he climbed up to hide in as a child			1
lazy lunches and drawn - out dinners blurred into late - night cocktails			1
in the @entity118 , the sommelier suggested a glass of @entity120 2013 with my starter			0
' it 's citrus and apricot with some honeysuckle at the end , ' he said			0
i might have been at an elegant restaurant in @entity127			0
my new best friend , though , was @entity129 , from @entity132 's @entity131 foothills			0
he quickly came to know that i liked my @entity134 spicy , and introduced me to his award - winning concoction called @entity136			2
all too soon i was saying cheerio to @entity129 and the gang , before making the walk along the jetty for the seaplane to @entity141			0
of course , i made use of one final cold towel			0
