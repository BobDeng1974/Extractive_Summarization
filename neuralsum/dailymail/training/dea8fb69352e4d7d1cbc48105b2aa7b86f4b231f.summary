and it nearly did in this case - in spectacular fashion			2
pranksters in @entity3 came within inches of getting badly burnt after a massive firework blew up in their faces			1
but then ... boom ! a second blast goes off seconds after the first - but this one is much much bigger footage of the incident posted online on january 14 shows a young man placing the mammoth rocket in the @entity29 before a car passes			0
he lights it and dashes off to the side as his friends yell and also run for safety			0
the firework lets off a small flash and bang as the man filming slows his retreat , seemingly thinking the danger is over			0
a fraction of a second later the mega rocket explodes fully , sending sparks shooting out sideways and surrounding the man filming with a blaze of light and smoke			0
all of the men escaped unscathed and can be heard beginning to laugh and sing as the smoke clears			1
the enormous flash of flame spread through the street , inches away from the pranksters			2

pranksters in @entity3 came within inches of getting badly burnt
but they escaped unscathed when their prank went badly *wrong*
