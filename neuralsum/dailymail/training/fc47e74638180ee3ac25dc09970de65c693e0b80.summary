researchers have found an unusual glimpse of the beginning of @entity3 deep in a @entity5 volcano			1
known as hotspots , volcanic island chains such as @entity7 can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years			1
researchers now say they have found unique chemical signatures that show them what conditions were like			1
@entity15 crash over lava as it flows into the ocean near @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			1
researchers say that volcanoes such as this , and several in @entity7 , can contain ancient primordial signatures			1
volcanic island chains such as @entity7 can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years			1
hotspot volcanoes are not located at plate boundaries but rather represent the anomalous melting in the interior of the plates			2
such intraplate volcanoes form above a plume - fed hotspot where the @entity3 's mantle is melting			1
the plate moves over time — at approximately the rate human fingernails grow ( 3 inches a year ) — and eventually the volcano moves off the hotspot and becomes extinct			2
another volcano forms in its place over the hotspot and the process repeats itself until a string of volcanoes evolves			2
the @entity46 geochemist studying @entity5 volcanoes has found evidence of the planet 's early formation still trapped inside the @entity3			1
@entity51 , an associate professor in @entity46 's @entity53 , and colleagues utilized high - precision lead and helium isotope measurements to unravel the chemical composition and geometry of the deep mantle plume feeding @entity7 's volcanoes			2
their findings appear today in the journal @entity64			2
in most cases , volcanoes are located at the point where two tectonic plates meet , and are created when those plates collide or diverge			2
hotspot volcanoes , however , are not located at plate boundaries but rather represent the anomalous melting in the interior of the plates			2

' so you end up with this linear trend of age - progressive volcanoes , ' @entity51 said			0
' on the @entity92 , the youngest is in the east and as you go to the west , the volcanoes are older and more deeply eroded			0
@entity20 has two linear trends of volcanoes — most underwater — which are parallel to each other			0
there 's a southern trend and a northern trend			0
' because the volcanic composition of parallel @entity107 trends is fundamentally different , @entity51 and his team decided to look for evidence of this in other hotspots			0
in @entity7 , they found three volcanic trends exhibiting three different chemical configurations as well as a fourth group of a late - stage eruption on top of the third trend of volcanoes			0
these different groups exhibit distinct compositions			0
' our goal was to figure out how we could use this distribution of volcano compositions at the surface to reverse - engineer how these components are distributed inside this upwelling mantle plume at depth , ' @entity51 said			0
each of the four distinct geochemical compositions , or endmembers , that the scientists identified in @entity5 lavas contained low @entity135 ( he - 3 ) and @entity137 ( he - 4 ) ratios			0
the team said the surprising discovery was that they all exhibited evidence for mixing with a fifth , rare primordial component consisting of high levels of he - 3 and he - 4			1
@entity146 , @entity7 : volcanic island chains such as @entity7 can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years			1
' we have really strong evidence that the bulk of the plume is made of the high @entity135 , -4 component , ' @entity51 said			1
' that tells us that most of this plume is primordial material and there are other materials hosted inside of this plume with low @entity135 , -4 , and these are likely crustal materials sent into the mantle at ancient subduction zones			1
' the unique isotopic topology revealed by the researchers ' analysis showed that the four low - helium endmembers do not mix efficiently with one another			1
however , each of them mixes with the high he - 3 and he - 4 component			0
' this unique set of mixing relationships requires a specific geometry for the four geochemical flavors within the upwelling plume : they must be hosted within a matrix that is composed of the rare fifth component with high @entity135 , ' @entity51 explained			0
' this new constraint on plume structure has important implications for how deep mantle material is entrained in plumes , and it gives us the clearest picture yet for the chemical structure of an upwelling mantle plume			0
