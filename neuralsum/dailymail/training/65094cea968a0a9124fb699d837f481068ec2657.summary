she had probably hoped to be munching on turkey rather than posing as one			0
but @entity4 the terrier knows — as many of us do — that there are some festive traditions which simply have to be carried out			2
the turkey costume is just one of the guises in which the rescue dog has appeared on owner @entity14 ’s @entity13 cards			1
mr @entity14 , 52 , a commercial photographer , began the photoshoots with his previous dog , @entity17 , in 1990			1
this was @entity4 's first @entity13 card guise do n't snap at me : @entity23 looks the part but is n't tempted by a pud on the giant fake mouse trap @entity17 was dressed up in antlers and a red nose for a card that mr @entity14 sent to his clients			1
they enjoyed it , asked what next year ’s would be			0
and the tradition was born			0
photographer @entity14 , 52 , uses the photos for his @entity13 cards in subsequent years , @entity17 became a fairy on top of the christmas tree and a choirboy			1
sadly , @entity17 died in 2002 at the grand old age of 17			0
but mr @entity14 and his wife @entity49 , also 52 , adopted @entity4 , who has been the star of the cards since 2006			1
first she was a camel , then — with a little help from a pair of modified bunny ears and a tennis ball nose — a donkey			0
what mr @entity14 calls the ‘ dog roast ’ came next			2
‘ i made the oval platter from @entity65 , cut a hole in the middle and filled it with towelling so it was comfortable for @entity23 to lie on , then placed the turkey on top of her , ’ explained mr @entity14 , who spends around a fortnight planning and making each set , and takes all the photos in his studio in @entity63			1
‘ i thought this may be impossible but @entity23 is a true star			2
she is a very sweet and gentle dog , and is very happy to be dressed briefly for the photos			0
‘ we do n’t make her do anything she does n’t like			0
and she always gets a treat afterwards			0
’ since then , @entity4 has been a lamb perched on ‘ shepherd ’ mr @entity14 ’s shoulders , a penguin on an iceberg , and even posed as @entity84			1
mrs @entity85 helps set up the shots , and the couple ’s children — twins @entity89 and @entity91 , 21 , and @entity92 , 18 — have also featured on cards over the years			0
for her latest — and last — shoot , @entity4 , who is thought to be 15 , became a mouse sitting beside a giant mousetrap and gazing at the @entity13 pudding bait			1
mr @entity14 said : ‘ this will be her final performance before her retirement due to old age			2
she still responds very well to tasty food so we lifted her on to the set for just a few minutes			0
' what the @entity105 ? @entity14 gets raggle ready to depict @entity84 from a @entity106 convincing : the little dog makes a great miser			2
bark @entity109 ! her owner says she is a ' true star ' and likes being briefly dressed in the outfits while shepherds watched : her natural coat could double for a lamb 's any day ( left ) , and bob bob bobbing along as a robin red breast little @entity119 : big ears and a tennis ball nose and @entity23 is perfect for one of the most important parts in the @entity125 scene			1

@entity23 the rescue dog features on her owner @entity14 's @entity13 cards in various festive - themed guises
she has been a turkey roast , a nativity scene donkey , @entity84 , a red - breasted robin and a little lamb
her latest - and last - shoot sees her dressed as a mouse behind a giant mousetrap , gazing at @entity13 pudding
photographer mr @entity14 began the tradition with his dog @entity17 , but @entity4 has been star of the show since 2006
