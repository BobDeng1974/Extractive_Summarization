the @entity12 's open @entity11 rules , also known as net neutrality rules , required internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content without restrictions or varying charges			1
but the @entity20 struck down the regulation , which was passed in late 2010 and challenged in court by @entity23 a @entity6 appeals court has rejected federal rules that required internet providers to treat all web traffic equally current net neutrality rules require internet service providers to give consumers equal access to all lawful content - be it web sites of streaming video			1
there are now fears internet providers such as @entity23 or @entity37 would begin to charge content providers for faster access or slow down or even block access to particular sites			1
the largest providers on tuesday pledged that they would not restrict how customers use the web , but consumer advocacy groups are concerned that in the future providers may begin charging content companies such as @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 for faster internet speeds			1
two judges , with partial support from a third , said the @entity12 did have authority to regulate broadband access , but the agency failed to show that it had authority to impose the anti-discrimination rules on broadband providers			2
the ruling is a victory for @entity23 and other broadband providers , who saw the @entity12 rules as government overreach into how they operate their networks			0
the largest providers on tuesday pledged that they would not restrict how customers use the web , but consumer advocacy groups said they worried that providers may begin charging content companies such as @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49 for faster internet speeds			1
the @entity12 had classified broadband providers as information service providers as opposed to telecommunications service providers , like telephone companies , and that distinction created a legal hurdle for the @entity12 's authority over them			2
this was the second time the court struck down the @entity12 's net neutrality rules			1
the @entity12 now could appeal the ruling to the full appeals court or to the @entity6 @entity85 , something @entity12 chairman @entity81 said he is considering as he looked at " all available options " to ensure internet networks remained free and open			2
the regulators could also try to reclassify broadband providers so they fall in the same category as traditional phone companies , a step that would give the @entity12 more oversight power			0
public interest groups have urged the @entity12 to do so , but the move would face staunch opposition from @entity97 and broadband providers			0
' unless @entity100 acts , we should stay our hand and refrain from any further attempt to micromanage how broadband providers run their networks ' @entity97 @entity12 commissioner @entity104 said			0
@entity107 leaders in @entity100 on tuesday urged the @entity12 to take advantage of the oversight power the court did recognize over broadband and offered support in rewriting the rules			0
republicans urged the @entity12 to stay hands - off			0
one of @entity117 's data centers where internet traffic is routed @entity81 recently has also suggested he could use existing @entity12 power to go after particular internet service providers who violate the open @entity11 principles on a case - by - case basis			1
former @entity12 chairman @entity124 , who oversaw the adoption of the open internet order in late 2010 and is now at investment firm @entity127 , declined comment on tuesday			0
supporters of the @entity12 rules worry that now internet providers such as @entity23 or @entity37 would begin to charge content providers for faster access or slow down or even block access to particular sites			1
' that 's just not the way the @entity11 has worked until now , ' @entity136 , policy director at public interest group @entity137 , told @entity141			0
but opponents say the rules inhibit investments and are not necessary to ensure open access to @entity11 content			2
' today 's decision will not change consumers ' ability to access and use the internet as they do now , ' @entity147 , @entity23 's general counsel and executive vice president for public policy , said in a statement			2
@entity6 @entity12 chairman @entity81 testifies before the @entity156 panel on @entity157 in @entity158 december 12 , 2013 as part of the net neutrality hearings			2
' @entity23 has been and remains committed to the open @entity11 which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when , where , and how they want			1
' ' this will not change in light of the court 's decision , ' @entity147 said			0
in the case against the @entity12 , @entity23 had argued the open internet order violated the company 's right to free speech and stripped control of what its networks transmit and how			0
prominent internet providers @entity37 and @entity178 also issued reassurances of their commitment to open @entity11 principles on tuesday , as did the @entity184 coalition representing various internet service providers and @entity186 , the wireless industry association			1
but content providers remained uneasy			0
' @entity189 but verify , ' said @entity190 , president and ceo of the internet association that represents content providers including @entity47 , @entity117 , @entity48 and @entity194 ' with the @entity11 and our member companies growing and changing and startups constantly popping up , protections do need to be placed for consumers			1
' net neutrality supporters warned that the decision could indeed open the way for @entity203 like @entity23 to compromise web access			2
' the biggest broadband providers will race to turn the open and vibrant web into something that looks like cable tv , ' @entity205 , president of the advocacy group @entity137 , said			0
' they 'll establish fast lanes for the few giant companies that can afford to pay exorbitant tolls and reserve the slow lanes for everyone else			0
