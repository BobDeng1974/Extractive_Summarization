a little boy has undergone more than 50 operations to have his entire face painstakingly rebuilt			1
@entity3 , now seven , was born with @entity5 syndrome , a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull , face , hands and feet			1
he endured a series of major operations to correct the deformities – which included a procedure to crack open and reshape his skull and another to rebuild his features			1
he also had a titanium frame drilled into his head , which was left there for nine weeks			1
@entity3 , seven , was born with @entity5 syndrome , a rare genetic condition which causes malformations the surgeries carried risks including meningitis , brain damage , catastrophic bleeding leading to stroke and potentially death , but @entity3 pulled through and now his parents say he absolutely loves his new face			1
@entity3 ’s mother , @entity33 , 47 , said she knew immediately something was wrong with her son when he was born			1
‘ when i saw him i had an overwhelming sense of love			0
but he looked so ill and his skin appeared plastic and his head was misshapen , ’ she said			0
‘ i also noticed his fingers and toes were sewn together			0
’ it was then a doctor broke the news he suspected @entity3 had @entity5 syndrome , a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally			1
the condition is caused by a chromosomal defect			2
children with @entity5 have bulging eyes that are usually wide - set and tilted down at the sides			2
they may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems , suffer from a cleft palate , and may have webbed fingers and toes			0
after his birth , doctors feared @entity3 would not last the night			1
the next day @entity64 and mrs @entity33 , who live in @entity65 , were forced to have a heartbreaking conversation with doctors about turning off his life support machine			0
specialists feared @entity3 's nose was totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone , blocking his airway			1
@entity3 , pictured with his twin sister @entity72 , has undergone more than 50 operations to have his face rebuilt but miraculously , @entity3 held on , and in the morning he was transferred to a specialist children ’s hospital where he had thin , metal tubes called stents inserted into his nose to help him breathe			1
he remained in a critical condition , surrounded by tubes and machines			2
finally , when he was a month old , @entity64 and mrs @entity33 were able to take him home to join his twin sister @entity72 and older sister @entity83 , then five			0
but he often stopped breathing in the night , and at 10 weeks old mrs @entity33 heard him crying			2
apert syndrome is a genetic craniofacial abnormality that occurs in around one in 160,000 to 200,000 births			0
the condition is characterised by malformations of the skull , mid-face , hands and feet			1
the skull is prematurely fused and unable to grow normally			2
the mid-face - the area from the middle of the eye socket to the upper jaw - appears sunken			2
some children with the condition have fused fingers and toes			2
early surgery can relieve the pressure that builds up inside the fused skull as the brain grows			2
and operations can be carried out to re-model a child 's face			1
she noticed that his left eyelid had been pulled behind his eyeball , causing his eye to pop out			0
after rushing to a doctor , he ended up having his lid sewn shut for a week			0
children with @entity120 syndrome have very small eye orbits , meaning more of their eyeball is exposed			0
@entity3 's eye orbits were so shallow , especially the left , that his eye regularly popped out of its socket			1
doctors advised @entity3 have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer			1
just six weeks later , he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain , save his sight and reshape his whole head			1
known as a ‘ front orbital advancement ’ , surgeons opened his skull , detached it , remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw			1
they also inserted two pins – each three inches long – into his head			0
for six months , the pins were turned twice a day to create more room inside his head to relieve pressure on his brain			0
@entity3 now needs 24 - hour care , which has put a strain on family life			1
mrs @entity33 said : ‘ @entity146 and i had a strong relationship and we talked to each other about how we felt			0
‘ but @entity83 was still young and had to grow up fast			0
when @entity3 was four months old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain , save his sight and reshape his whole head his fingers were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp things properly			1
when he was 17 months old surgeons operated on him to separate @entity3 's fingers and toes down to the first knuckle ‘ and as for @entity72 , every time @entity3 was admitted to hospital , she ’d look around wondering where he was			1
‘ but she was thriving , passing all the usual milestones			0
‘ it was also clear she had a special bond with @entity3			1
sometimes they ’d snuggle up together			0
‘ when she learnt to sit up we propped @entity3 up with cushions and they ’d spend ages playing together			1
and when @entity72 became mobile she ’d fetch @entity3 his favourite toys			1
’ @entity3 ’s fingers were fused together – known as ‘ mitten hands ’ – and so he struggled to clasp things properly			1
but when he was 17 months old a surgeon at @entity178 agreed to operate on them			0
during a nine hour operation , involving bone and skin grafts , he separated @entity3 ’s fingers down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toes			1
in a second operation he finished the process , separating them fully			0
mrs @entity33 said : ‘ @entity3 had all four limbs in a cast for seven weeks but the results afterwards were amazing			1
‘ he grew in confidence overnight and a couple of weeks later learnt to sit up by himself			2
‘ @entity194 as a button he ’d would watch @entity72 intently and began to copy her			0
as a family we were astounded by his progress			0
so too were the doctors			0
’ but the outside world was less understanding , and mrs @entity33 said people would whisper whenever she took billy out in his pram			0
‘ walking down the street one day i heard one woman say to her friend : " @entity207 he looks awful "			0
earlier this year @entity3 had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine weeks ‘ i was so upset i went straight home			1
‘ another time when the twins were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see @entity216 when @entity83 noticed some children pointing at @entity3			1
‘ she told them not to do it because it was rude			0
afterwards i overheard their mother saying : " well she should n’t bring him out should she			0
" ‘ if only they knew what @entity3 was going through			1
’ but determined not to wrap their child in cotton wool , @entity64 and mrs @entity33 sent @entity3 to nursery and he went to exactly the same school as his twin sister @entity72			2
despite his difficulties he has turned into a typical little boy , obsessed with cars , reading books , and enjoying playing fancy dress with his sister			0
since his most recent surgery , @entity3 loves his new face , his mother @entity241 said ‘ he loved life and was determined to join in with everything , ’ mrs @entity33 says			1
in the summer of 2012 he underwent more major surgery			2
during a nine - hour operation surgeons took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium springs to allow for more growth			1
his condition also left him with a distorted face and his eyes were becoming more and more exposed due to shallow eye sockets and breathing was a struggle			2
so earlier this year he also underwent high risk mid-face surgery , where his face was literally taken apart , reshaped and put back together again to create more room			1
his head was cut from ear to ear and his face cut vertically , with the skin being pulled down , exposing all of the bones of his face and jaw			2
his forehead , eye orbits , nose and top jaw were taken apart , reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wires and bolts			1
the frame was left in place for nine weeks to encourage the bone to grow , as well as pull the existing facial bones forward			2
the bones were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screws on the frame , a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate			2
mrs @entity33 said : ‘ so far he ’s endured more than 50 general aesthetics and has been through so much			2
‘ but since his recent surgery he loves his news face			0
when he saw it for the first time without the frame i think he would have done cartwheels if he could			0
‘ it was a massive boost to his confidence			0
‘ and now , a few months on , he does n’t even associate himself as having @entity120 syndrome			0
‘ but what ’s incredible is the way he ’s taken everything in his stride			0
we ca n’t thank all the doctors and nurses enough who ’ve looked after him			0
