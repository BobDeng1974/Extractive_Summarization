scroll down for more @entity1 student @entity7 , 20 , will be regretting getting quite so carried away at a recent unlimited mimosa brunch after his embarrassing alcohol - fueled exploits have left him the talk of the internet the footage starts with @entity7 and his equally well - oiled friends causing a nuisance outside a dry cleaners on @entity36 in @entity21			1
a blonde girl attempts to help a man in a blue shirt stand up straight , while @entity7 takes issues with the man filming them			0
the man with the camera explains that his is unhappy about them loitering on his property and so @entity7 attempts to one up him by claiming that his father is in real estate and ' owns half of f * * king @entity21			1
' when asked his name , @entity7 responds ' @entity52 , ' adding later that ' i ’m a f * * king lawyer			2
' the footage starts with @entity7 and his equally well - oiled friends causing a nuance outside a dry cleaners on 28th street in @entity21 @entity7 apparently used the phony surname because his drunken friend - who by this point is on the pavement - is himself an @entity52 , a wealthy @entity62 real estate family who do n’t own half of @entity21 either			2
eventually the drunken students depart the scene , but not before @entity65 utters another classic lines : ' you think i do n't own the cops ? ' and ‘ do you want me to call [ @entity62 mayor ] @entity71 on you right now ? ’ since waking up with a hangover and realizing his embarrassing exploits are all other the internet , @entity7 has done his best to disappear by deleting his @entity76 and @entity77 accounts			1
unfortunately for @entity7 , he was n’t able to delete everything about him online and @entity79 has reported that surprise , surprise , @entity82 was n’t being totally honest with his idle boasts			0
his father is n’t a property magnate , but rather @entity85 is a garment industry executive , while his mother @entity86 is an event coordinator and member of the @entity89 zoning and planning board			2
eventually the drunken students depart the scene , but not before @entity65 utters another classic line : ' do you want me to call @entity71 on you right now ? ' perhaps deservedly @entity7 is receiving a lot of scathing criticism online for being ‘ over-privileged ’ and ‘ an insufferable rich - kid			1
’ but it appears this member of @entity1 ’s @entity101 is n’t all bad and his accomplishments include co-founding a charitable organization called @entity104 that helps low - income immigrant families in @entity107 , @entity20			0
if this latest incident was n’t embarrassing enough for @entity110 , it has also helped to shine a spotlight on his past as a former thespian			2
at age 13 , he played the @entity114 in a community center production of @entity116 , a @entity118 adaptation produced by his mother			0
the musical included ' unbelievable hip hop dance routines ' and a script that ' was recreated with a @entity124 twist , ' according to a @entity126 clip			0
perhaps deservedly @entity7 is receiving a lot of scathing criticism online for being ' over-privileged ' and ' an insufferable rich - kid '			0

@entity7 , 20 , is the talk of the internet after his drunken exploits on a @entity21 street were captured on video
the @entity1 student and his three friends were loitering after an alcohol - fueled brunch , when a man started filming them
@entity7 *'s* attempt to get the man to stop included boasting that ' my dad owns half of f * * king @entity21 '
the drunken student then claims he is a ' f * * king lawyer ' and gives a false name
eventually the students depart , but not before @entity65 utters another classic line : ‘ do you want me to call @entity71 on you right now ? ’
his father is n't a property magnate , but rather a garment industry executive
if this incident was n't embarrassing enough for @entity110 , it has also helped to shine a spotlight on his past as a *teenage* thespian in @entity116
