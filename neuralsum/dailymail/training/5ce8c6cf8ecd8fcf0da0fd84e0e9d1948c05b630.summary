but after tucking into one of the shellfish he felt a ' lump ' in his mouth			0
@entity5 bought two @entity15 oysters from his local fishmonger in @entity17 as a hangover cure the small round pearl is an unusual find because the pearls sold as gems usually come from pearl oysters , not @entity15 warehouse manager mr @entity5 , of @entity17 , @entity24 , thought he 'd lost a filling but spat out a round pearl			1

i thought a filling had fallen out			2
