the @entity1 official who accused @entity2 of doctoring his own online biography was exposed yesterday as a former @entity4 member			1
the @entity6 chairman had been accused this week of using an anonymous user id to delete embarrassing facts about his past and add unflattering details about his political rivals			2
but yesterday it emerged that the senior @entity1 administrator who investigated the allegations - following a tip - off from the left - wing @entity16 - was a former @entity18 - @entity4 member			1
@entity20 , 29 , who goes by the online name ' @entity22 me ladies , i 'm the @entity24 ' , is one of the @entity27 's top administrators for the website			1
he once described himself as ' @entity4 to the last '			2
mr @entity2 angrily denied the claims , insisting the story was ' untrue from start to finish '			1
mr @entity20 ' decision was also criticised by other @entity1 activists , who warned that the site should not be used to ' play politics ' and referred the case to an internal arbitration committee			1
one user wrote : ' i do n't know if ' @entity22 me ladies , i 'm the @entity24 ' did anything wrong but it 's just rather obscure , and doing this during the peak campaign time for the @entity27 2015 elections as some sort of assignment from a journalist seems odd			2
' mr @entity20 , from @entity56 , @entity57 , described himself on @entity58 as ' @entity4 ( to the last ) ' before deleting his profile yesterday			1
he joined other party members who signed a letter to @entity16 in january last year calling for @entity62 to have the @entity18 - @entity4 whip withdrawn over his refusal to apologise for making unwanted advances to female activists			2
the internet expert , who has served in the @entity68 , has been a @entity1 volunteer since 2004 and became an administrator for the website in 2007			2
he is also a paid employee of @entity71 , a charity which promotes the volunteer - written encyclopedia			0
furious denials : @entity2 yesterday continued to deny he was behind the @entity1 changes among his @entity76 friends is @entity1 co-founder @entity77 , who married @entity79 's former diary secretary @entity78 in 2012			1
he was once featured in a @entity81 profile that called him ' one of the @entity27 's top @entity83 ' and reported that he spent up to eight hours a day working on the site			1
responding to the criticism yesterday , mr @entity20 insisted he was not a @entity18 - @entity4 activist and said he would never let his political views interfere with his @entity1 work			1
he added : ' i have never considered myself ' active ' in any party , although i have been a lapsed member of the @entity4 on and off , for probably a year in total since 2010			2
' mr @entity20 toned down his conclusions about mr @entity2 ' possible connections to ' @entity33 ' , revisions to one of his @entity1 pages show			1
at first he claimed the @entity6 chairman ran the account either directly or indirectly , but later he changed this to suggest simply that the account was run by a user called ' @entity102 ' who was linked to mr @entity2 ' office by @entity16 in 2012			1
mr @entity20 admitted that @entity1 's top officials had ' chastised ' him for his handling of the case , although he refused to back down yesterday			1
he said : ' while a link has clearly been drawn between @entity102 and @entity33 , it is impossible to know who was sitting behind the keyboard of @entity33			2
' but given the nature of edits , i suspect that it was mr @entity2 or someone close to him			1
' the @entity4 used the claims to poke fun at the @entity6 chairman when the story broke on tuesday night , and senior figures in the party continued mocking him yesterday			2
@entity18 - @entity4 leader @entity121 said he believed the denials but then joked that the person behind the account could have been ' @entity125 ' , the pseudonym used by mr @entity2 to promote get - rich - quick schemes before he became an mp			1
a @entity18 - @entity4 spokesman said mr @entity20 had ' no connection to @entity131 '			1
' the first time we saw this story was in the @entity16 , and the first time we know about him was when we were asked about him this afternoon , ' he added			0
minister @entity136 , left , and @entity6 election supremo @entity137 , right , were among those mentioned in the @entity1 edits mr @entity2 yesterday continued to furiously deny he was behind the @entity1 changes , and @entity6 cabinet ministers rallied behind him			1
he said : ' it 's categorically untrue			0
it 's absolutely nothing to do with me			0
it looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies			0
' @entity149 came to his defence , insisting the @entity151 mp was doing a ' great job '			0
@entity71 @entity27 spokesman @entity153 said to the best of his knowledge mr @entity20 did not brief the @entity4 about his actions			1
' i would be incredibly surprised if he had done and would say it 's out of character , ' he told the @entity160			0
' i 've worked with @entity20 for three and a half years and his politics have never entered into anything in that time			0
' the @entity16 rejected criticism that its story did not made it plain that it had prompted the @entity1 inquiry into alleged links between ' @entity33 ' and mr @entity2			1
a spokeswoman for the paper said : ' the article clearly states that this was a @entity16 investigation which brought to light some potential breaches of @entity1 's own rules , which were then communicated to the site 's administrators			2
