the earliest example of @entity2 irrigation in @entity3 , dating back almost 2,000 years , has been discovered in @entity4 - and it may have been used to produce wine			1
a network of ditches and ridges was found on the site of a proposed new £ 1 billion development on farmland at the edge of the town , near the @entity14			1
researchers believe the channels were used as a vineyard , or to grow asparagus , and are being hailed as evidence of ' intense agriculture ' dating back to around 70ad			1
the network of ditches and ridges , pictured , were found on a development site in @entity4			1
researchers from the @entity24 believe the ditches were used to grow grapevines or asparagus and date back to @entity27 historians have long suspected the 370 - acre ( 150 hectare ) site could have been home to an ancient @entity2 settlement			1
archaeologists were invited to explore the site 18 months ago before work begins on the major new development of housing , shops and a new school			0
by march last year they had uncovered evidence the site was once home to a @entity42 settlement pre-dating the @entity43			2
a team from the @entity24 have now uncovered the irrigation system across the northern section			2
during the @entity48 , level plains were used for cultivation			0
to plough the soil , @entity2 farmers used a simple soil breaker called an ‘ ard ’ , pulled by oxen			2
fields were ploughed at various points at right angles to each other to create a flat and even surface			0
the @entity43 then built dams and reservoirs needed for irrigation			0
@entity63 collected in these dams and reservoirs and could then be distributed through channels easily and effectively , increasing the amount of crops that could be covered			0
this was vital in producing enough food for the large and growing @entity2 population			2
water for crops and farms , as well as for public baths , fountains , and homes , was brought into cities and towns via roman aqueducts , such as the @entity80 aqueduct , ( pictured above ) in @entity81 , @entity82			0
aqueducts were built on gradients , made of stone , brick or concrete			0
most were buried underground , and many featured distribution tanks to control the supply when needed			0
team leader @entity91 said it was evidence of an ‘ intense agricultural regime ’ dating as far back as @entity27			1
‘ our findings from excavating around the ridgeway have unearthed zebra - like stripes of @entity2 planting beds that are encircled on their higher northern side by more deep pit - wells , ’ continued @entity91			1
‘ the gully - defined planting beds were closely set and were probably grapevines or possibly asparagus			2
the @entity43 built dams , pit wells , pictured at the site in @entity4 , and reservoirs for irrigation			2
the find near the @entity14 is being hailed as evidence of ' intense agriculture ' and is thought to be the earliest example of @entity2 irrigation in @entity3 historians have long suspected the 370 - acre ( 150 hectare ) site could have been home to an ancient @entity2 settlement and archaeologists are continuing to dig at the planned development on @entity123 farmland between @entity124 and the @entity14 extraordinarily , after carefully peeling off the clays , we saw a series of ditches lining the wells and the horticultural beds			1
‘ clearly in dry spells , water could have been poured from the pit - wells into the ditches to reach the beds			0
‘ this is a tremendously significant find that reflects the area 's intense agricultural regime from the @entity2 period			1
it 's an unparalleled discovery and the earliest evidence of @entity2 irrigation in @entity3			1
‘ people do n't think about wells and irrigation being a significant invention but it was incredibly sophisticated			0
i mean how many hours do women in @entity148 have to go to collect their water ? ’			0

the network of ditches and ridges were found in @entity4
researchers believe they were used to grow grapevines or asparagus
the find is being hailed as evidence of ' intense agriculture ' in the region
team leader @entity91 *claimed* the system dates back to @entity27
if *confirmed* , the find is the earliest example of @entity2 irrigation in @entity3
