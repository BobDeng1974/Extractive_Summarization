by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 19:33 est , 26 october 2012 a homeowner has become the first person to win a payout from @entity4 for harassment and breach of contract after being mis - sold a tariff by a doorstep salesman			1
@entity10 , 59 , won his four - year legal battle against the energy giant after the cheap rate he signed up to failed to materialise			1
the 59 - year - old was instead put on a tariff that would potentially cost an extra £ 2,000 over the two - and - a - half year contract			2
@entity10 with some of the letters npower sent him			2
he has become the first person to win a payout from an energy company for harassment when he refused to pay the difference , @entity4 began chasing him for payment , hiring ten debt collection agencies to pursue him			1
mr @entity10 took his case to the small claims court , which awarded him £ 1,000 compensation for breach of contract and harassment			1
yesterday , the safety and environmental consultant said that the company ’s tactics had been ‘ truly frightening ’			1
‘ we were threatened that people may come to our house with a magistrate ’s warrant and forcibly enter our home to disconnect our gas and electricity , ’ he said			1
‘ this was a truly frightening prospect			0
my wife and children were scared to open the front door in case bailiffs came bursting in			0
we were so concerned we were going to be left in the dark without power or heating			0
’ mr @entity10 originally signed up to a price plan named @entity51 2011 when a doorstep salesman called at his house in @entity54 , @entity55 , in 2008			2
under the terms of the deal , he would pay just 7.5p per kilowatt of electricity and 2p per kilowatt of gas until 2011			1
strong - willed @entity10 triumphed over npower in a landmark legal wrangle , after a four - year battle over a door - to - door sales contract father - of - two @entity10 said : ' i do n’t normally give doorstep salesmen the time of day but i was very dissatisfied with my supplier as they always seemed to be holding several hundred pounds of my money in credit			1
' i told him that i would take the npower package provided i could pay my bills by online banking , rather than direct debit			0
' he agreed , we shook hands and i signed up			0
' however , he was later told this tariff had been withdrawn and that he had been placed on the standard rate , which was twice as expensive			0
@entity10 refused to pay the extra and instead only paid what he should have been under the terms of the @entity51 2011 plan			1
but by february 2009 he had received a letter from npower demanding he pay £ 332.93 or they would enter his house and cut off his gas and electricity supply			1
mr @entity10 contacted the @entity88 before launching civil proceedings			2
he claimed @entity4 had breached its contract and @entity92			1
@entity10 eventually accrued a ‘ debt ’ of £ 2,000 and the family received over 60 letters from npower and were repeatedly threatened with bailiffs			1
the father was informed that the @entity99 had been withdrawn and he had instead been placed on the company 's standard tariff in his witness statement submitted to @entity103 in july , @entity10 said he felt ' bullied and intimidated ' by npower			1
he said : ' at no time in my life have i ever been in debt to anyone or any organisation			0
' i have never used credit or hire purchase arrangements to acquire any goods or services ( apart from my mortgage )			0
' i most certainly have never been on the receiving end of debt collection activities			0
' i can confirm that it is a horrible , demeaning and stressful experience to go through - and it is particularly frustrating when you know you have done nothing wrong and are not actually in debt , simply standing up for a point of principle			0
' deputy district judge @entity124 ruled at @entity103 in july that the contract was binding and @entity4 should pay £ 1,000 compensation			1
a spokesman for @entity4 said it considered the court ’s decision over the issue of harassment ‘ to be in error ’			2
‘ we settled with the customer , taking into account the time it took to resolve his complaint , ’ he added			0
' all issues have been reported back to the business to review its procedures			0
' but @entity10 , who is the first person to successfully take npower to court , is still unhappy			2
he said : ' they state that they consider the court ’s decision to be in error			0
' well , if they did n’t like the court ’s judgement there ’s is a well - established mechanism in this country for appeal			0
' it ’s disgraceful that a large organisation like npower can just cock a snoot at a @entity161 and tell them that they ’re wrong			0
' he is now with @entity164 , and is ' over the moon ' with their services and his £ 143 monthly bill for their detached home			0
@entity4 was fined £ 1.8million by watchdog @entity171 for mis - selling doorstep policies in december 2008			2
after originally saying that they believed the court 's decision was erroneous , a spokesperson for @entity4 said in a statement : ' this was a genuine dispute over the tariff he originally signed up to npower with			1
' we 're pleased that the matter is now resolved and mr @entity10 has been compensated for the mis - selling of the tariff			1
' we always try to do the best by our customers and so we 're sorry if we have upset mr @entity10 as this certainly was not our intention			2
' a spokeswoman for industry regulator @entity171 said : ' we aware of mr @entity10 's dispute with npower and the @entity103 's judgment that , in that case , npower 's behaviour amounted to a breach of the @entity197			2
' under part 8 of the @entity199 , @entity171 has the power to take enforcement action in relation to failures to meet certain obligations , where there is harm to the collective interests of @entity209 consumers			0

energy company withdrew original offer and demanded he pay a significantly *higher* tariff
when @entity10 refused , they threatened to enter his home and cut off his gas and electricity supply
