by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:20 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 21 february 2013 falling out : @entity2 has hit back at @entity4 's accusations of ' misinformation ' he was accused by @entity4 of ' spreading false information ' about her , along with suffering ' memory lapses ' in his new tell - all memoir the soundtrack of my life			1
but @entity2 is standing by his comments and defended himself via a @entity13 post entitled : ' statement from @ @entity15 regarding @ @entity16 ' he wrote : ' i am truly very sorry that she has decided to take issue with what i know to be an accurate depiction of our time together , ' he writes			2
@entity4 wrote a long open letter accusing the @entity25 chief of spreading ' misinformation ' about her after the record executive claimed she broke into ' hysterical sobbing ' when he demanded that her hit ' since u been gone ' be included on her album , @entity33			1
@entity4 - whose stellar career was guided by @entity2 after she won @entity35 - lashed out , saying : ' i refuse to be bullied and i just have to clear up his memory lapses and misinformation for myself and for my fans			1
' it feels like a violation			1
growing up is awesome because you learn you do n't have to cower to anyone - even @entity2			2
' @entity2 refutes @entity4 's post , which includes accusations of ' memory lapses			1
' ' before the book was published , i had every fact checked with five independent individuals who were present on a daily basis throughout it all , ' he wrote			2
response : the music mogul took to his @entity13 page , maintaining his depiction in the soundtrack of my life ' the chapter as it is written was thoroughly verified by each and every one of them			2
i stand by the chapter as written in my book			2
at the same time i wish , and will always wish , @entity4 's talent and her career to soar to ever new heights			1
' @entity2 also paid tribute to the @entity35 winner 's talents in his post			0
' as anyone who has read the soundtrack of my life knows , i think @entity4 is a tremendous vocal talent and performer			1
' in the book , i provide an in - depth look at our years together during which we shared major multi-platinum success , as well as a few creative differences			0
' response : @entity4 wrote a strongly worded letter to her fans via @entity13 , accusing her former mentor of ' misinformation ' and ' bullying ' in the soundtrack of my life			1
the 80 - year - old music executive - who discovered @entity87 - tells how he fell out with @entity4 over her desire to help pen her own songs on her third album , my december			1
@entity2 recalled that he did n't believe the material contained a number one hit and told the singer 's manager he was ' out of his mind ' to believe otherwise			2
he also wrote about a meeting with @entity4 in in which he told her that my december was ' a pop album that still needs pop hits '			1
but in a lengthy statement posted on @entity100 , @entity4 wrote : ' so i just heard @entity2 is releasing a memoir and spreading false information about me and my music			1
' first , he says i burst into " hysterical sobbing " in his office when he demanded since you been gone be on my album			1
his stories and songs are mixed up			0
' overjoyed : @entity4 picked up her third grammy of her career at the music awards ceremony in @entity114 on february 10 glittering : @entity4 's career has gone from strength to strength since she won the first season of @entity35 she said they rowed after @entity4 insisted that she wanted more guitars added to the original demo track - and @entity2 did not , saying she eventually prevailed , adding : ' i could n't be more proud of the life of that song			1
i resent him dampening that song in any way			0
' but , yes , i did cry in his office once			0
i cried after i played him a song i had written about my life called " because of you			0
" controversy : @entity2 makes the claims in his new book @entity134 ' i cried because he hated it and told me verbatim that i was a " s * * * * y writer " who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon me			0
' he continued on about how the song did n't rhyme and how i should just shut up and sing			0
this was devastating coming from a man who i , as a young girl , considered a musical hero and was so honoured to work with			0
' but i continued to fight for the song and the label relented			0
and it became a worldwide hit			2
he did n't include that in the book			0
' @entity4 revealed that she was hurt by his accusations about her album my december and its lack of ' pop hits ' - and the claims that it did n't chart to well because she co-wrote it			1
she also accused @entity2 , currently the chief creative officer of @entity25 , of actively trying to ' sabotage ' the album			1
she said ' well , first let me say , i 've co-penned many of my " pop hits			0
" secondly , my december went platinum ( it sold 20,000 less than @entity164 which followed my december			0
) hardly a huge failure			0
' never again , the only single they released in the @entity168 from that record was a @entity171 hit			2
' i am very proud of that and i have my fans to thank			0
but , again , what 's most interesting about his story is what he leaves out : he does n't mention how he stood up in front of his company at a convention and belittled me and my music and completely sabotaged the entire project			0
engaged : @entity4 and her fiance , @entity184 , beam at the @entity185 earlier this month ' it never had a chance to reach it 's full potential			1
my december was an album i needed to make for myself for many reasons and the fact that i was so completely disregarded and disrespected was so disheartening , there really are n't words to explain …			2
' @entity4 , who is signed to @entity196 records , won her third @entity185 earlier this month for @entity197 for her fifth studio album , @entity199			1
and the star , who is engaged to music manager @entity184 , finished her message by writing : ' anyway , i love my job			2
i love my label and all of my professional relationships … now			0
and i am grateful for @entity2 for teaching me to know the difference			0
' cheers to another amazing year			0
