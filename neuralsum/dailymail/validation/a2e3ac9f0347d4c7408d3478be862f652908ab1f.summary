the @entity0 has confessed to what it 's calling an ' em - bear - assing ' mistake regarding one of its animals			1
park officials were planning to transfer @entity7 to @entity8 , @entity9 , when they discovered that the two - year - old @entity11 bear is a female , not a male as thought			1
according to keepers , the species ' genitalia are highly undeveloped before the age of two , making it very difficult to determine gender			1
the @entity0 was planning to transfer @entity7 to @entity8 , @entity9 , when they recently discovered that the @entity11 bear is a female , not a male as thought ( above pictured in july 2013 , left , and a year later , right ) apparently the @entity11 bear - native to @entity27 - is also particularly difficult to sex because there has been limited captive breeding across the @entity31 many have been incorrectly sexed as cubs at other facilities in the past , the @entity32 notes			1
@entity7 was the first @entity11 cub successfully born and raised at the park			2
she was given her first medical exam at four months old when her gender was determined			0
she had n't been handled too much since the check - up , as employees felt she was doing ' very well ' with her mother , @entity44			0
the animal had n’t been handled too much since her first check - up at four months old - when her sex was determined - as employees felt she was doing very well with her mother , @entity44 ( pictured together , above ) it was n’t until last week , when @entity7 underwent a routine examination and health evaluation that it was found ' he ' was actually a female bear			2
the zoo said @entity7 still might go to @entity8 , but now that they know she 's a ' she ' , it opens up other options for the bear 's participation in a breeding program			0
experts called the mistake ' great news for the management of this rare bear '			0
the concluded : ' all births are critically important for this species as they are so rare in zoos , and having another young female is beneficial to the entire breeding program and survival of the species			0

park officials were planning to transfer the animal to @entity9 when they discovered they had got the sex wrong
experts say it is an easy mistake to make as the @entity11 bear cubs ' genitalia are highly undeveloped before the age of two
