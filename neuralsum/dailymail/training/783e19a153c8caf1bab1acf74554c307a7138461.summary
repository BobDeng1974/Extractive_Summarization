@entity7 has terminated its relationship with @entity1 after founder @entity0 ( pictured ) used ' offensive remarks ' to introduce the brand 's fall 2015 menswear show in @entity6 this week ' when describing our brand 's latest collaboration , i spoke recklessly using terms that were both ignorant and offensive , ' he said in a statement sent to @entity30			1
' i apologize and am deeply regretful for my poor choice of words , which are in no way a reflection of my personal views			0
' @entity7 's president , @entity35 , told racked that after the company became aware of the ' offensive remarks ' made by mr @entity0 , he chose to ' immediately terminate ' @entity7 's involvement with the @entity1 brand , including the footwear collaboration we had planned for this fall			1
' simply stated , this kind of language and approach is in complete contrast with our values			0
@entity7 seeks to collaborate with designers and brands who are at the forefront of lifestyle trends ; equally important , they must also share our values			0
' we will not tolerate offensive language or racial slurs of any kind being associated with the @entity7 brand			1
' according to @entity1 , mr @entity0 did n't mean to offend			2
in an earlier statement sent to @entity58 , the brand stated that mr @entity0 was simply making a reference to two moments in recent popular culture			2
while holding up a sign that read , ' @entity13 # # @ $ in @entity6 , ' mr @entity0 explained that @entity1 's collaboration with @entity7 is ' a very strong ghetto signifier ' yesterday @entity7 chose to ' immediately terminate ' its involvement @entity1 , including the footwear collaboration it had planned for this fall ' one being the song @entity68 in @entity6 by @entity70 and @entity71 and the second being the @entity73 film @entity74 in @entity6			1
the connection was used to describe a look for the collection and was in no way intended to cause offense			0
' @entity80 printed mr @entity0 's original remarks , revealing that he called the collection ' last n * * * * s in @entity6 ' because ' it 's the sweet spot when the hood — the ' hood — meets @entity73 's movie @entity74 in @entity6			1
so that 's ' n * * * * s in @entity6 ' and @entity87 * * * * s in @entity6			2
' i mean , it 's nice to play with the strong signifiers			0
the @entity7 here is a very strong ghetto signifier			1
in the ghetto , it is all the @entity95 , all the big chain			0
not at the same time — never ; it 's bad taste			0
' so we designed @entity95 with @entity7			0
' later , @entity80 asked mr @entity0 to clarify what he meant			0
he explained via email : ' i made looks which are a cross-over of those two references : the @entity7 shoes and the sweat pants are iconic of hip - hop , and the camel hair color coat , worn with nothing under it , is iconic of that precise movie			0
' i am friends with @entity70 [ @entity114 , who recorded @entity13 * * as in @entity6 with @entity71 ] , and he and i presented a joint collection at the same place , one year ago , and that this thing is only a homage to our friendship			2
