by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has admitted that he was unhappy @entity3 refused to move over for him in sunday 's @entity4			1
@entity3 , on a different strategy to @entity2 , was told to let his only rival for the @entity7 through on two occasions ; an order he twice ignored			1
@entity3 , who finished third after starting from the pit lane following a fire in qualifying , claimed he was ' very shocked ' that @entity13 issued the order			1
but @entity2 believes his team - mate was wrong to defy the instruction			1
the @entity24 still leads the championship , but he saw his gap reduced to 11 points after @entity3 managed to finish one place higher than pole - sitter @entity2 despite starting from the pits			1
@entity2 held a 10 - second lead in the opening phase of sunday 's race before a safety car was deployed following @entity36 's crash in the wet conditions			2
i 'll drink to that : @entity3 finished third in sunday 's race despite starting from the pit lane @entity2 lost time behind the safety car , which saw @entity3 leapfrog him at the first round of pit - stops			1
the 29 - year - old has since questioned the timing of its deployment			0
' the safety car , the way it came out was just wrong i think from the race officials , ' added @entity2			2
' they sent it out at the wrong time and i got stuck behind it			0
' you are supposed to do this average speed , slow lap but i got stuck behind it			0
it was slow so all those guys got by me and that is not supposed to be the case , so that was the main problem			0
' blow : @entity2 was leading sunday 's @entity4 until the deployment of the safety car @entity2 then rued an issue with his brakes which saw him lose two places in the immediate aftermath of the first safety car period			0
he was also left disappointed that he failed to pass @entity3 on the final lap despite being presented with an opportunity to pass the @entity73 after he locked up heading into @entity74			2
' the thing i am most annoyed about is the last lap because i had a little opportunity – just so close but i did n't manage to do it – 30 centimetres missing or something , ' he added			0
' what he [ @entity3 ] did was ok , the way he defended , because the guy on the inside it is his corner so the guy on the outside needs to make it far enough in front that the other guy ca n't push him out and he managed to do that and that is what annoyed me most			0
