an endless , steep road spirals up ahead of me and in the heat of the @entity5 sun it seems insurmountable ... until a somewhat over-enthusiastic @entity6 sprints straight past me			1
yes , it seems the secret to his rock - hard abs and enviable tan is impossible runs up the mountains of the @entity14 , where he is doing anything but partying into the wee small hours			1
i have signed up to @entity17 , the retreat tucked into a beautiful sprawling farmhouse near the coastal town of @entity21			1
the before and after shots showed the difference the @entity5 camp made to @entity6 's figure it is famed as the bootcamp to the stars ( alumni include @entity31 contestants , model @entity32 and former @entity35 @entity34 )			1
and as if to prove a point , the indomitable made in @entity38 stalwart turns up unannounced on my first day			1
we 're a nervous bunch at 7am as we stand in our lycra waiting to meet @entity43 - a former personal training instructor in the @entity45			1
we had all arrived at different times the day before , dropped off at this picture - perfect villa @entity47 , where its fragrant gardens give way to a beautiful pool and an outdoor seating area makes the perfect spot for @entity54 lunch and dinner			1
@entity56 is located near the pretty @entity5 town of @entity21 , not far from the beach relaxation time is spent on loungers around the pool in the villa 's pretty gardens just down the road is the beach - where @entity43 hosts classes when he feels we need a change of scene - and all around are rolling hills criss - crossed by hiking routes which we explore in the afternoons			1
a bundle of energy with the essential booming voice that every instructor needs , @entity43 has us all weighed , measured and taking part in a basic series of exercises as an introductory fitness test before we have even had breakfast			1
when we do eventually sit down my serving of porridge looks decidedly small as he talks us through the week - 7am intensive workouts for 20 minutes , three - hour hikes , swimming pool - based activities , boxing classes , team games and endurance work - outs on the beach are just some of the highlights			1
@entity6 works out during a boxing circuit with former @entity45 personal training instructor @entity43 fellow made in @entity38 star @entity6 lost a stone by taking part in @entity93 in @entity5 and we 'll be doing all this while on a severely calorie - controlled diet			1
our amazing chef and nutritionist @entity97 will be serving up three meals a day and snacks , but it will all be sugar , gluten and dairy - free			1
my stomach rumbles in sympathy			1
as it turns out , the food is delicious			1
for the first 48 hours i feel hungry and have a slight headache - all part of the detox process apparently - but soon enough i start feeling fulfilled by the meals and we certainly have a great mix of foods , from hamburgers and ' chips ' ( sweet potato ) to fish , salad , stuffed peppers and frittata			2
@entity119 writer @entity118 poses with @entity6 in the sunny gardens at @entity56 there are 13 of us in my group and we create a whole spectrum of shapes and sizes			2
of the four men , @entity6 is at the fitter end of the scale , while others admit they work long hours and do n't have the chance to work out			2
among us females we have everything from a professional stunt woman looking to hone her shape , to a slim girl who just wants to get fitter and an overweight woman who is keen to kick - start her weight - loss			2
the rest of us could just do with losing a few pounds			2
thankfully , the variety means we 're not pitted against each other			2
@entity43 is quick to tell us we are only competing with ourselves			2
some of us excel during the running and endurance training , others are great when it comes to weights			1
i learn an entirely new workout vocabulary			2
it 's all about maintaining form ( basically , making sure you do the exercises properly and do n't do yourself a mischief )			2
we interchange @entity153 ( @entity153 - where you blast through exercises with 100 per cent , but it 's all over quite quickly ) with isometric training ( strength training focusing on one muscle or group of muscles )			1
despite the somewhat alien terminology , we 're all soon using the jargon and @entity43 takes care to explain exactly what each class is doing for our bodies and why it is perfectly balanced with the previous exercise circuit			2
do n't be fooled though , he 's not all friendly and cuddly - do n't let him catch you slacking off			2
when @entity43 decides the group needs a change of scene , he moves the workouts to the nearby beach porridge with figs , a healthy burger and sweet potato chips and a stuffed pepper keep us full of energy @entity180 muesli , a refreshing salad and a delicious @entity184 prawn curry are also on the menu in @entity5 thankfully , it 's not all high - octane			0
between classes we 're given time to recover , some people swim , others sunbathe and i drag my bruised and battered body into the shade for a nap			1
by day three i am pretty sure my body is about to give up on me altogether			0
walking up the 10 stairs to my bedroom ( there is a choice of sharing rooms or having one to yourself ) takes about five minutes			0
even rolling over in bed sends shooting pains through my muscles			0
but somehow in each class i manage to find myself working through the exercises			0
perhaps @entity43 terrifies my muscles into submission , but by the end of day three they suddenly start easing up again			0
this is helped in no small part by a massage booked with local therapists who come to the villa for bookings ( it is the best € 70 i have ever spent )			0
after a particularly strenuous walk , @entity6 cools down with an impromptu shower from a local spring throughout my personal ups and downs , @entity6 remains irritatingly energetic			1
he is the first to finish exercises , the fastest runner and the most likely to whip off his top in the heat ( well , it is a female - dominated group and he has ladies to impress - even the red and sweaty ones )			0
06:00 wake - up time ( this was a little later during my stay in @entity5 ) 07.00 short , intense 20 - minute workout 07:30 a healthy breakfast to kick start the day 08:30 first full class of the day 10:00 snack and a short break 10:30 circuit training or similar 12:00 lunch & much needed break 13:30 a long countryside hike 16:30 team games & exercises 17:30 stretching & similar exercises 19:30 a well - deserved gourmet dinner which is how i find myself being overtaken by the @entity38 resident while tackling a particularly steep hill			1
we are on one of our final hikes , a favourite activity of mine which allows us to ramble all over the countryside , taking in sea views from clifftops and clambering through forest paths , with the intense smell of pine trees all around			0
our final hike ends with a devastatingly steep road which @entity43 has the bright idea of making us run up			1
we take off full of enthusiasm , round a corner and see that it seemingly goes on forever			0
chest heaving , muscles straining and mentally making a note to kill our instructor , i haul myself up , only for @entity6 to come bounding past , giving a thumbs up to the camera ( @entity43 also loves nothing more than filming his victims - i mean participants - for a surprisingly touching montage to be shown at the end of the week )			1
at the top there are high fives all - round , shout - outs to those bringing up the rear and even a few sweaty hugs			0
for our final night , we 're allowed ' off - campus ' and into town for a dinner of our choice and even a sneaky glass of wine			0
but @entity97 and @entity43 have cleverly organised it so that our final weigh - in is the following morning , so we 're desperate not to over-indulge			0
@entity6 and instructor @entity43 demonstrate how an old mill discovered during a hike can be used for a workout small groups mean that everyone gets the attention they need and the chance to bond while taking part in the activities , such as the three - hour afternoon hikes despite the concentration of bootcamp on exercise and healthy lifestyles , we have n't been weighed in since our first day and there is little talk of ' diets ' and body comparisons			1
everyone just seems to get on with doing their best			0
prices at @entity5 start at £ 850 for a week - for bookings go to www.no1bootcamp.com or ring 0208 504 4183			0
the @entity5 camp reopens for 2015 on march 28 and is open through till the end of october			0
@entity93 also runs weight loss retreats in @entity318 ( open all year round ) and @entity319			0
so what 's the verdict ? @entity6 loses a reasonable seven pounds this time around ( he has previously lost a stone in one trip ) , our ' biggest loser ' sheds an amazing 11 pounds			0
quite a few hover around the seven pounds mark and i lose four , which is n't too bad			0
@entity97 reminds us that we will probably go on losing a couple of pounds the following week and i find that actually , it 's not the weight i 'm worried about so much anymore			0
my arms feel more defined , i feel lighter in myself and my body feels less sluggish thanks to the leaner diet			0
to me that is much more valuable than a few lost pounds .			0
