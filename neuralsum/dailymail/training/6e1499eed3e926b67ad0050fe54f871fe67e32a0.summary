five penalties from @entity1 saved @entity2 from a surprise home defeat at the @entity4 as they edged strugglers @entity5 15 - 7			1
for three - quarters of the match , @entity5 were easily the better side but they failed to take their chances and only had a solitary try from @entity10 , which was converted by @entity11			1
@entity10 and fellow wing , @entity13 , had caused the home defence huge problems but ill - discipline and careless errors cost @entity5 the match			1
five penalties from @entity1 saved @entity2 from a surprise home defeat by @entity5 at the @entity4 @entity2 fielded a much weakened line - up with @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 all absent through injury			1
@entity24 and @entity25 were also rested , while @entity26 started on the bench			0
fly - half @entity1 , and number eight @entity29 both made their first @entity31 starts			2
@entity5 made eight changes from last week 's defeat at the hands of @entity36			2
skipper @entity37 returned as did fellow forwards @entity39 and @entity40			0
@entity10 , @entity41 and @entity13 were recalled to take up places in the back division			2
@entity5 began with a thrilling movement , which almost resulted in the game 's first try			2
inside his own half , @entity13 fielded a clearance kick , before exploding past three defenders to set up a position in the opposition 22			0
the ball was recycled for @entity10 to bounce off @entity55 's attempted tackle before being forced into touch , inches short of the try line			2
@entity5 dominated but only had a solitary try from @entity10 , which was converted by @entity11 however @entity2 relieved the early pressure to take a ninth minute lead when @entity1 kicked a penalty			1
@entity61 breaks from @entity62 for @entity2 and @entity13 then followed but though neither resulted in tries , although they certainly contributed to a highly entertaining first 20 minutes			2
@entity5 continued to be the better side but @entity11 spurned their first chance for points when his penalty attempt went badly astray			1
the @entity5 then suffered two further blows in quick succession			2
first , lively full back @entity70 left the field with an injury to be replaced by @entity74 before lock @entity75 limped off with @entity76 coming on			0
@entity10 goes over in the first half , it was all the @entity5 had to show for their efforts the second quarter was nowhere as good as the first as it was frequently disrupted by treatment for injuries			1
however there was still some creative running with bursts from @entity87 and @entity41 testing the opposition defences			0
@entity2 had a chance to extend their lead by kicking an easy penalty but they opted for an attacking line - out			0
this proved to be the wrong call as hooker @entity96 's throw went straight to a @entity5 jumper			0
the visitors made them pay for that error by scoring the opening try in first - half stoppage time			0
from a line - out in the home 22 , the @entity5 pack drove forward and @entity10 was on hand to force his way over , with @entity107 converting for a deserved 7 - 3 lead at the interval			1
@entity1 's remarkable kicking game saved @entity2 from defeat and took them nine points clear of @entity5 @entity2 began the second half poorly so they made two replacements after nine minutes of the half with @entity116 and @entity117 being introduced into the front row			1
@entity119 soon followed onto the field as he replaced @entity121			0
against the run of play , @entity2 reduced the arrears to one point			0
@entity87 and @entity126 made strong runs to get the hosts into the @entity5 half and earn a penalty			0
@entity1 made no mistake with the kick			0
@entity134 's restart went straight into touch , which handed @entity2 the initiative , and when @entity5 were again penalised @entity1 put them 9 - 7 ahead on the hour - mark			1
care became the fourth @entity2 ' replacement just in time to see @entity1 kick his fourth penalty after @entity141 was penalised for not releasing			1
the home side then had their best period of the match and another @entity5 infringement saw @entity1 again on target to send the @entity5 home without even a bonus point			1
@entity2 forward mark @entity150 charges forward during the @entity31 match			0

@entity5 were *unlucky* not to beat @entity2 at the @entity4
@entity10 scored the only try , it was converted by @entity11
@entity1 kicked five penalties to save @entity2 from a shock home defeat
@entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were absent through injury
