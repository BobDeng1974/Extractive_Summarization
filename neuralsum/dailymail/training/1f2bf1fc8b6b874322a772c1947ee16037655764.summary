she also thought a fine - dining experience would give them an opportunity to learn etiquette , which could come in happy as they get older			2
' the passed hors d'oeuvres were very interesting because the children were wondering , could we take the whole tray or do we just take one off of the tray ? ' she said			2
new traditions : the family named the event the @entity97 of @entity98 and are planning to host another one next year , getting sponsors involved ' so this was an educational opportunity as well because now they all know how to eat a four - course meal and the etiquette involved in that			1
