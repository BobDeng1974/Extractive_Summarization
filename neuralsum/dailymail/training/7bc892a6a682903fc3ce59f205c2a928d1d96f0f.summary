by @entity0 jailed : @entity1 lied that he was a barrister and brain surgeon for almost 20 years and even won a client a court case a serial conman who made false claims of being a brain surgeon and a barrister for nearly 20 years has finally been jailed			1
he was exposed , ironically , after posing as a barrister and winning a court case against another fraudster			1
@entity1 , 42 , won almost £ 8,000 for his client at @entity17 's @entity16 in a lawsuit against known conman @entity19			1
but @entity1 ’s conduct in court was his downfall			1
despite losing , the opposing legal team became suspicious that @entity1 was n’t a real barrister when he used ‘ nonsensical legal propositions ’ and made the bizarre boast that he was actually a brain surgeon who merely ‘ dabbled in law ’			1
the police were called and an 11 - month investigation revealed that he ’d been spinning an astonishing web of lies over a number of years – and had conned his first victim , an ex-girlfriend , out of tens of thousands of pounds			1
they also found he ’d used false legal qualifications to study law and set up a solicitor ’s firm and made claims to his ex that he was a multimillionaire brain surgeon ‘ who lived near the @entity45 ’			1
@entity1 was actually penniless and a stay - at - home son who slept in the spare room of his parents ’ house			2
he met his first victim , a 45 - year - old divorcee , in 2004 , through a dating website			0
he convinced her to look at prestige homes for sale in the @entity55 area of @entity56 as well as two @entity58 cars - and she loaned him £ 40,000 from her £ 66,000 divorce settlement			0
during their four - year relationship the woman , a nurse , had a child before splitting up with him in 2009 after she became increasingly wary of his tall tales			0
@entity1 later tried to sue her for custody of their child , and her parents had to remortgage their home to pay the £ 25,000 legal costs			1
in a statement she said : ‘ @entity1 has totally destroyed my life , both financially and psychologically			2
i ended up off work sick with depression for 12 months			0
he has made a total fool out of me			0
in july 2012 he met his next victim , @entity76			0
@entity77 : @entity1 said that he was a millionaire brain surgeon with celebrity neighbours , but in fact lived in this semi-detached house with his parents he told her he was a barrister and said he would be able to help her over her legal battle with conman @entity19 , 53 , who she claimed took a £ 42,000 investment from her for a tv production venture and breached terms of a contract			1
little did ms @entity76 know that @entity1 had made up his credentials			2
police said @entity1 had used entirely false qualifications and fraudulent degree certificates to win places on a number of university degree courses between 1997 and 2012			1
they included @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity101 in @entity103 and @entity104			0
he eventually created a bogus law firm , @entity105 , using forged degree certificates			0
but that did n’t stop him taking the case and audaciously representing her in court			2
he was n’t convincing enough for the defendant ’s legal representation , though – and neither did he pull the wool over the eyes of the judge			0
the judge asked him to write down some information about his legal background , but @entity1 misspelt ‘ @entity118 ’			1
at @entity119 on tuesday , @entity1 , of @entity120 , near @entity121 , was jailed for four years and four months after he pleaded guilty to seven counts of deception and one count of carrying out a reserved legal activity			1
detective @entity126 from @entity127 said : ‘ @entity1 convinced both women they could trust him and rely on him			2
‘ he used the pretence that he was a barrister and brain surgeon to gain their trust even further , leading to him deceiving one of his victims out of thousands of pounds			0
‘ even upon his arrest for the original offence , his lying continued and he tried to convince the officer that the victims and witnesses were mistaken and he was in fact a student			0
‘ thankfully , we were able to see through his lies and he is now serving time behind bars			0
’ passing sentence judge @entity147 said @entity1 was a ‘ knowing and manipulative fraudster ’			2
@entity1 ’s lawyer @entity148 said : ‘ he lived in a fantasy world			2
the theme is very much of self - aggrandisement - and misguided optimism how things would turn out			0
