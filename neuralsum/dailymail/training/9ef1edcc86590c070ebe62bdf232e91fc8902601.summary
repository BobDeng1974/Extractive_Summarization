by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the private firm which tests benefits claimants to see if they are fit to work has quit its £ 500million contract after claiming its staff received death threats			1
days after ministers said @entity9 was ' committed ' to its contract , the @entity12 it company confirmed it was pulling out early			1
it follows mounting criticism about its treatment of sick and disabled people lose benefits , including cutting benefits unfairly and ordering a woman in a coma to attend jobs courses			2
protesters hold placards outside @entity9 's @entity25 headquarters in august 2012 the @entity26 insisted it had achieved a good deal , with @entity9 paying to get out of the contract			1
it had been due to carry out @entity30 until august 2015			0
ministers stressed that @entity9 will not receive any compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of the contract , and had made a " substantial " financial settlement to the @entity26			1
claimants undergo a @entity9 when applying for @entity38 , to see how their illness or disability affects their ability to work			1
the @entity26 said last summer it had identified ' significant quality failures ' in the written reports produced by @entity9 following assessments			1
an improvement plan was put in place , but the government said it was now looking for a new provider to replace @entity49			0
the @entity26 said to ensure a smooth transition , one national provider will be appointed early next year to take over the contract			2
in the longer term it is intended to move to multiple providers to increase competition			0
disability minister @entity56 insisted the government had secured a good deal , with @entity9 paying to exit the contract early @entity56 , minister for disabled people , said : ' the previous government appointed @entity9 as the sole provider for carrying out @entity30 and since then we have carried out several independent reviews and made significant improvements to the assessment			1
' today we are announcing that we are seeking a new provider to replace @entity49 , with the view to increasing the number of assessments and reducing waiting times			1
' i am pleased to confirm that @entity9 will not receive a single penny of compensation from the taxpayer for the early termination of their contract , quite the contrary , @entity9 has made a substantial financial settlement to the department			1
' @entity9 has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended for work or put through stressful medical interviews			1
one third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has become a lightning rod for left - wing critics of the government ’s welfare reforms			2
but it has warned of the impact of staff who have been threatened for their decisions			0
each month last year they recorded about 160 incidents of the public assaulting or abusing staff , the @entity104 reported			0
protests had erupted outside their offices this week , when staff received deaths threats in person and on @entity113 and @entity114			0

’ @entity126 's @entity125 said : ' people have been badly let down by @entity9 which is why @entity126 has repeatedly called on the government to sack them with immediate effect			2
' but changing the contract is n’t enough			0
it ’s time for the government to reform fundamentally @entity30 so that disabled people who can work are given support they need to find a job			0
' @entity136 , @entity138 's @entity137 , said : ' @entity9 were part of a wider system and process problem			2
' it 's departure might be welcomed by some but it leaves blind , partially sighted and other disabled people in a very uncertain situation			0
' @entity26 will face lots of questions but it also has an opportunity to re-examine the whole process			0
blind and partially sighted people need to know what further delays will now be experienced in seeking an assessment or accessing support to find work			0
people already face months of delays and @entity138 would urge @entity26 to work quickly to ensure people needing support are not left in limbo			0
