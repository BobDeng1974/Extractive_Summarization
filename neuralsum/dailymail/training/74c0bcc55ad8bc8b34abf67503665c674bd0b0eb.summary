his comments delighted @entity11 insiders , who dubbed the @entity7 president ‘ @entity12 ’			1
@entity1 jumped into @entity4 politics today by calling for a ' no ' vote in the independence referendum			1
he also called for @entity8 to stay in the @entity16 while mr @entity18 will openly welcome the president 's intervention in the @entity3 and @entity16 debates , there is likely to be concern in @entity11 that it will reinforce the impression that the political class are out of touch with ordinary @entity26 the pair held bilateral security talks on the fringes of the @entity31 meeting of world leaders in @entity33 today			1
but in a press conference afterwards , mr @entity1 upsetting @entity3 nationalists and @entity37 eurosceptics with his praise for the @entity4 and @entity16 the @entity39 said his renegotiation of @entity8 's relationship with @entity33 was designed to keep the country in the @entity16 mr @entity1 's - speaking at a joint press conference during the @entity44 at the @entity45 in @entity33 today - risked diplomatic anger over his insistence that @entity8 should stay in the @entity16 the @entity7 president also admitted that he was likely to meet @entity50 president @entity49 at tomorrow 's d - day ceremonies standing with @entity18 at a @entity31 press conference in @entity33 , president @entity1 made it clear that @entity54 would prefer to see @entity3 vote no in september , rather than face the uncertainty involved in the break - up of one of its closest allies			1
he said the @entity4 ’s future was ‘ up to the people of @entity8 ’ but added : ‘ from the outside , at least , it looks like things have worked pretty well			1
‘ and , you know , we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies that we will ever have remains a strong , robust , united and effective partner			0
but ultimately these are decisions that are going to be made by the folks there			0
’ mr @entity18 nodded but made no comment as mr @entity1 spoke			0
but a @entity11 source welcomed the @entity7 leader ’s remarks , adding : ‘ we certainly agree the @entity4 has been strong , robust , united and effective			1
’ president @entity1 and mr @entity18 held a bilateral meeting during the @entity44 at the @entity45 today			2
they were joined by @entity7 national security adviser @entity81 ( front left ) and the @entity4 's @entity83 ( front right ) mr @entity18 met @entity50 president @entity49 at @entity85 in @entity86 before they travelled to @entity88 ahead of the 70th anniversary @entity52 commemorations the prime minister 's meeting with mr @entity49 came after the @entity31 leaders met in @entity33 after refusing to attend a planned conference in @entity50 @entity50 's leader did not appear concerned that he had been rebuked by mr @entity18 and @entity7 president @entity1 for his annexation of @entity98 the intervention from the @entity7 president electrified the no campaign in @entity3			1
cross-party group @entity102 mocked up a famous poster of mr @entity1 with the word ‘ @entity104 ’ replaced by ‘ nope ’			0
shadow foreign secretary @entity105 said : ‘ as a global statesman , president @entity1 understands that interdependence is a defining feature of our modern world and that building bridges , not putting up new barriers , is the challenge of our generation			0
’ @entity3 conservative leader @entity115 described the president ’s intervention as the ‘ most internationally significant to date ’			0
‘ he clearly recognises the strong and effective partnership his country has with the @entity4 and our many shared achievements through the years , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity3 walks taller , shouts louder and stands stronger on the world stage because we are part of the @entity4			2
’ @entity125 , @entity126 leader , said the @entity7 president had made a ‘ significant contribution to our discussion about our future ’			1
mr @entity18 held private talks after a @entity31 session dedicated to the global economy and the @entity134 crisis in @entity33 today president @entity1 ’s words angered some nationalists , but @entity138 leader @entity137 , who has never met mr @entity1 , last night tried to play down their significance			1
recycling the @entity7 leader ’s election campaign slogan , mr @entity137 told @entity142 @entity3 : ‘ so , in summary , i suppose my message to president @entity1 is “ yes we can ” … an independent @entity3 will mean that @entity7 has two great friends and allies here rather than one			1
’ the strength of president @entity1 ’s comments took @entity11 by surprise as it is highly unusual for the @entity7 leader to intervene in the domestic affairs of a close ally			1
former labour foreign office minister @entity155 said : ‘ foreign , unsolicited advice is only going to anger @entity3			0
i ’m surprised that he has stepped in			0
’ @entity1 said yesterday he ‘ makes no apologies ’ for the controversial release of @entity7 sergeant @entity161 in a @entity163 prisoner swap			2
he said the soldier ’s health was deteriorating and added : ‘ we were deeply concerned about it			0
we saw an opportunity and we seized it			0
’ by @entity169 @entity3 could treat themselves to fish and chips every day for ten weeks or drink more than 600 cappuccinos a year if they vote ‘ no ’ to independence , @entity171 civil servants claimed yesterday			0
the items were among a string of incentives to stay in the @entity16 compiled after the @entity178 estimated @entity3 would be £ 1,400 - a - year better off as part of the @entity4			1
but nationalists branded the @entity182 ’s list a ‘ patronising gimmick ’			0
published with pictures of @entity187 characters on the @entity189 website , other suggestions included ‘ 280 hot dogs ’ at the @entity191 , a holiday abroad for two with ‘ cash left over for sun cream ’ and ‘ hugs to celebrate being in the @entity4 ’			2
senior @entity196 were privately dismayed by the gaffe , which is a far cry from @entity18 ’s emotional appeal to @entity3 earlier this year that they would lose ‘ something very powerful and precious ’ if they leave the @entity4 in the independence referendum on september 18			2
the new row over the tone of the no campaign comes amid criticism that the cross-party @entity102 group , headed by former chancellor @entity206 , has been too negative			0
attempts to highlight the downsides of ending the 300 - year @entity16 seem to have backfired			2
the @entity210 campaign , which was at 29 per cent in polls last autumn , has crept up to 40 per cent with just over three months to go before the referendum			0
@entity214 users slammed the list of items as ‘ absurd ’ and said ministers were treating @entity3 people ‘ like imbeciles ’			0
a spokesman for first minister @entity137 said : ‘ this is a new low from the @entity178 who should apologise to people across @entity3 for this patronising gimmick … they should also say sorry for being caught red - handed trying to cook the books on an independent @entity3 ’s finances			1
’ @entity178 spokesman @entity227 added : ‘ this is the kind of patronising attitude to @entity3 we have come to expect from the @entity231 … the real figures are that £ 300billion of @entity234 tax revenues have flowed from @entity3 to the @entity178 over the last 40 years … but all we get in return from @entity171 is bogus figures and silly nonsense			0

@entity7 president says the @entity4 has ' worked pretty well ' and should stay together
also called on @entity8 to stay in the @entity16 in 2017 referendum
says he is ' sure the people of @entity8 will make the right decision '
remarks will *infuriate* first minister @entity137 and @entity249 's @entity248
