members of some of the @entity3 ' most notorious street gangs have infiltrated shelters housing illegal immigrant minors from @entity6 and are recruiting them , say @entity8 sources			1
an estimated 57,000 minors from @entity6 have flooded across the border from @entity11 to the @entity3 in recent months , and gang leaders are reportedly filling their ranks from among them			1
transnational gangs such as the @entity15 , also known as @entity16 , and the 18th street gang are using established juvenile members from @entity6 to cross the border and recruit other children to the cartels , say sources			1
recruiting drive : there are reports that gangs are trying to recruit young immigrants from @entity28 facilities where they 're being held transnational : a young @entity31 member of the @entity33 street gang			2
there are reports that young members are enlisting other youngsters crossing the border according to @entity41 , @entity40 agents have witnessed gang members using a @entity44 phone bank at the facility at @entity46 , @entity47 , to ' recruit , enlist and pressure ' other minors into crossing the border			1
@entity51 , vice president of the @entity52 , a union which represents border agents , says agents have witnessed the recruiting process			1
the @entity8 and @entity55 said earlier this week that they have no knowledge or evidence that gangs are recruiting immigrant minors			1
' we know it â€™s happening because agents are telling us , ' @entity51 told @entity41			1
' @entity62 is trying to downplay it			0
' gang culture learned in the @entity3 : @entity65 , one of the leaders of the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) gang flood : more than 57,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the southwestern border since october , more than twice the total this time last year he said agents have overheard conversations in which recruits are given phone numbers to call after crossing the border in order to contact gang members			1
ironically , many immigrants flooding across the southern border of the @entity3 say they 're fleeing violent gangs in @entity6			2
experts , however , say those gangs are actually a byproduct of @entity3 policies in the 1990s that sent many immigrants back to @entity6 after they had been indoctrinated into gang culture in this country			2
the violence they took with them easily took hold and flourished in @entity96 , @entity97 and guatemala - countries with weak , dysfunctional governments			0
one study estimated some 350,000 @entity6 immigrants illegally came to @entity102 from 1980 to 1985 while trying to escape civil war and corruption in their home country			2
they arrived with few @entity107 skills , and many settled in poor neighborhoods with strong @entity11 gangs and black gangs			0
to survive and avoid bullying , some formed gangs such as @entity16 or joined others such as the 18th street gang			0
they committed serious crimes and were sent to prison , where they were further exposed to violent gang culture			0
detainees : many of the children arriving from @entity6 are fleeing gang violence in their homelands in the 1990s , the @entity3 increased deportations of immigrants facing criminal charges , particularly gang members			1
as many as 1,500 @entity96 , @entity131 and @entity97 youths were sent back each month to @entity6			0
they arrived with the notoriety of being a @entity134 gangster			0
' there 's this huge explosion in all three of these countries of the gangs and the number of gang members , partially because it 's the way of street kids getting status and reputation , and partially because it 's a way of surviving , ' said @entity144 , a @entity145 associate professor who has studied the issue			1
what is the relation between the gangs and the influx of immigrants at the @entity3 border ? many people fleeing @entity6 say they are running from violence perpetrated by the gangs			2
but the migration is also an effort to reunify families			0
at least 80 per cent of youths stopped at the border have one parent or a close relative already in the @entity3 , said @entity163 , former commissioner of the @entity164 and senior fellow for the @entity166 , a nonpartisan think tank in @entity168			0
family members already in the @entity3 have saved enough money to pay a smuggler to bring their children across the border so boys wo n't be forcibly recruited into gangs and daughters wo n't be subjected to sexual violence .			0
