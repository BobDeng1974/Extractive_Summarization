suspicious : @entity55 , played here by actor @entity147 @entity55 is a psychiatric disorder where a person is convinced their partner is being unfaithful - but with very little , if any , proof to confirm their fears			1
the name is derived from @entity154 ’s @entity55 , who killed his wife @entity156 after suspecting her infidelity			1
the condition presents itself as jealous and controlling behaviour and sometimes violence - but the two main characteristics are delusions and obsessions			0
in men the jealousy tends to focus around sexual infidelity , whereas in women it may centre around emotional betrayal			1
treatment includes antidepressant and antipsychotic medication and / or therapy			0

' the only thing that could put my mind at rest was banning him from watching any programmes that have women in them			2

‘ that ’s why i decided to order the lie detector online			1

‘ i put @entity6 through a lot but he ’s stood by me through it all so i know he ’s the man for me			2
i think lots of women out there must be suffering from the same condition and just not realise it			0
