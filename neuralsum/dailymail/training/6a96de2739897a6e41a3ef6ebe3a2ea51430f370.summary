last month , @entity1 - winning filmmaker @entity0 committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train at @entity7 's @entity6 station during rush hour			1
@entity0 's untimely death at the age of 36 came just a year after he won an @entity1 for his ground - breaking documentary ' @entity12 ' and initially bewildered many friends			1
but those close to @entity0 witnessed a dramatic change of attitude in recent months , as the @entity18 director dealt with his new - found celebrity and struggled to find another passion project			1
' i know he had been depressed for a short period and depression is something you can die from , ' his older brother @entity21 announced the following day			0
' but the question of why , no one can answer ; it will ache in my chest the rest of my life			0
' still , the sudden suicide shocked other friends , like @entity33 who called @entity0 the ' happiest person i knew '			1
' if i think of every person i 've met in my whole life , he was the least likely to take his life -- the least , ' @entity40 told the @entity41			0
descent into depression : @entity18 filmmaker @entity0 committed suicide last month , a year after he won the @entity1 for best documentary			1
pictured above receiving the award end of the line : @entity0 committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train at @entity7 's @entity6 subway station			1
above , one of the platforms at the station last days : @entity0 's friends told the @entity58 reporter how he had become increasingly isolated lonely in his last year of life while none of his friends or family know what plagued @entity65 for certain , they did notice changes in his personality following the crazy success of @entity12 , a documentary about a long - lost @entity71 musical icon found living in poverty in @entity73			1
@entity65 poured his heart into the documentary , working on it for five years			2
but after winning the @entity1 for the film , he did n't know what to do next			1
before his death , he had been living for months in @entity80 , writing for a new project on a @entity71 conservationist			1
but the big city had turned @entity65 into an insomniac and he confessed to at least one close friend that he felt lonely			2
early in may , he returned home to @entity18 where he met with @entity87 , and she offered him a new project to work on , which she thought would be a good transition from @entity12			1
he started work on may 5 , but the very next day wrote @entity87 saying he was n't interested in the project anymore			1
' i ca n't come in to do this , ' @entity0 told her			1
' i want to have a small challenge , not too big a challenge			0
' @entity0 would die exactly a week later			1
friends believe that it was his challenge finding a new project after such early success that might have caused him to sink into mental illness			1
' in [ my limited exposure to depression , it 's the darkness , it 's completely like there 's no hope , ' @entity65 's mentor per @entity110 said			2
' i was wondering if there was something that made him go up and down , but which he dealth with through his work , his movie - and suddently there was n't anything			2
there was a silent period			0
and so the darkness comes up			0
' up all night : recently , @entity0 had been living in @entity80 working on a new project , but had developed insomnia there were also certain eccentricities that may have been clues of a deeper , lingering mental illness			1
@entity65 had a strict work regimen , involving a lap around his apartment at the beginning and end of the work day			2
he would also write uninterrupted every day from 8am to noon			0
and if he slept in , he would turn the clocks back to 8am so he would n't be thrown off his routine			0
these habits extended outside of work as well			2
friends say he would eat the same breakfast every day just for the thrill of being able to change the meal after six months			2
and one time , he broke up with a girlfriend to end the relationship at exactly four years , four months and four days			0
' it always seemed totally reasonable when he said it , ' recalls @entity87			0
' he was very convincing			0
' in retrospect , @entity144 says these habits may have been a way to distract from deeper issues			0
' it was like he was creating ways to not be disappointed , ' she said , ' so he was n't disappointed , until now			0
and when it came , it struck him so hard because he was n't used to it			0
i think that this [ depression ] was a total shock for him and very unexpected			0
he did n't have the tools to handle this situation			0
it was like a psychosis , i think			0
