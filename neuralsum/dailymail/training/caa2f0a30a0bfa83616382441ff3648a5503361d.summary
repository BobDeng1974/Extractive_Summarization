@entity1 manager @entity0 has said qualifying for the @entity3 again would be a bigger achievement than running @entity5 close to the @entity7 title last season			1
and the @entity11 boss , whose side face city at @entity11 on sunday two places outside the top four , claims the pressure is on @entity15 and @entity16 in the race to get among @entity19 's elite			1
@entity0 is on a 10 - game unbeaten league run though thursday 's @entity23 exit against @entity24 was costly because it closed one possible route to the @entity3 and upset preparations with the players not returning to @entity28 until 4am on friday morning			1
@entity0 says finishing in the top four this season would eclipse last year 's achievements @entity1 were knocked out of @entity19 in midweek , but have had a busier schedule this season he believes the club 's early - season woes are behind them – they were 10th as recently as december - and says the players deserve credit for overcoming the loss of @entity37 , a long - term injury to @entity39 , the impending departure of @entity41 , the extra demands of @entity44 competition and the difficulty in assimilating eight new signings made over the summer			1
' if we arrive in the top four this year , with everything we have been though , it will be a greater achievement than last year			2
absolutely , ' said @entity0			2
' it was certainly an incredible achievement to go so close last year but we only had to play one game a week			2
making the top four this year would certainly be better			0
' our backs were against the wall , we were n't playing very well and when you do n't win games you get criticism			0
no one likes it but you have to accept it			0
there is no doubt this season we have leareda lot and by the end of it i will be a better manager			0
' one of @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity1 are set to miss out on @entity3 football next season , a hammer blow to any of those huge clubs			1
@entity0 claimed : ' i think there is probably a big pressure on @entity15 and @entity16 from where they 've been probably over the last 15 to 20 years			2
last season , with @entity37 in the team , @entity0 ' side finished second behind @entity5 ' @entity15 is a club that has been synonymous with that and probably through to at least the quarter - finals of the competition			1
@entity82 's record of getting them qualified has been outstanding			0
that is what you are up against			0
but i think it tells you the competition in this country			0
it 's quite exciting really that you are fighting until the end			0
' @entity1 's famous 3 - 2 win against @entity5 last april put them top of the @entity7 and seven poitns clear of @entity96 's side , though they did have two games in hand			1
but a home defeat against @entity100 and draw at @entity101 cost them and they eventually fell two points short			0
@entity0 insists he has been too busy to dwell on it this season but acknowledges it is something he could look back on in years to come			1
of more immediate importance is trying to get @entity1 back into the @entity3 after this season 's disappointment that saw them exit at the group stage			1
' that is the priority , ' says the manager			0
@entity1 's reputation worldwide is second only to @entity15 largely due to their success in the 1970s and 80s but with @entity100 and @entity5 growing their fan bases , owner @entity115 needs to keep the club among the elite to protect his brand			1
@entity0 talks to his team before the penalty exit against @entity24 on thursday night in @entity124 @entity1 take on champions @entity5 on sunday hoping to keep pace with @entity16 and @entity15 @entity15 had to pay over the odds for the likes of @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 to compensate for missing out on the @entity3			1
@entity1 have n't got similar cash to burn on transfer fees or wages – they only escaped @entity135 punishment last week because they successfully argued part of their spending was for an expansion of their stadium			2
' we are about developing and creating world - class talent			0
@entity1 is still talked about as a worldwide club , which is important , ' he said			2
@entity144 is likely to return to the team for the crucial @entity7 clash against @entity5 @entity147 , replaced by @entity0 on thursday , is in the squad to face his former side on sunday ' i think the top four looked a long way off from where we were but we always believed that once we could work together and have more working time together , we could challenge			1
again it is the elite competition , the @entity3 , it is where the best players and managers want to work and we put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity to do that			0
' @entity144 and @entity163 are expected to return from the side that lost on penalties to @entity24 though @entity41 is still out with a hamstring problem			0
there could be a place in the 18 - man squad for @entity147 who helped @entity5 win the league in 2012 .			2

@entity1 finished second last season after coming close to title
but having lost @entity37 last summer , @entity0 says top four would be even more *impressive*
