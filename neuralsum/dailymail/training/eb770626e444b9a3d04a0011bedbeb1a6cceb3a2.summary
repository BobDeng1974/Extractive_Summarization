by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 20:12 est , 12 december 2012 @entity2 voice : the cockerel was branded a potential ' noise nuisance ' by his local council after one neighbour complained when a new resident arrived in a picturesque village , it did n’t take him long to ruffle a few feathers			1
for rather than fitting in with the ways of country folk , the townie moaned about the noise – from @entity16 the rooster			1
he complained to the council , only to find villagers flocking together to support the much - loved cockerel			1
now the newcomer and his wife have moved out , much to the relief of residents in @entity26 , near @entity27 , @entity28			0
the unnamed couple were upset by the noise being made close to their detached £ 450,000 home at 5am every day and the husband made an official complaint about @entity16 to @entity27 and @entity35			1
council officials warned blacksmith @entity37 , who owns the rare exchequer leghorn cockerel , that they had a duty to investigate			1
they said checks would be made to see if the bird ’s crowing was excessive – and if it was , enforcement action could be taken under the @entity44			1
but the threat sparked a village revolt , starting with a petition that was launched at the local coffee morning			2
it was signed by 160 people – more than half the villagers			0
such was the ill - feeling towards the newcomer , villagers say , that he went into hiding			2
he and his wife have since sold their home and moved out of @entity26 , meaning the complaint is no longer valid			0
mr @entity37 , who has had @entity16 for more than two years , said yesterday that he was relieved the threat to his rooster had been lifted			0
close - knit : outraged villagers launched a petition at a local coffee morning to make sure that @entity16 was not removed ‘ i am glad it is all over			1
i was overwhelmed by , and very grateful for , the support for @entity16 , ’ he said			0
‘ hearing a cockerel crowing in a rural village is part and parcel of living in the country			1
' the villagers got quite upset about this one complaint and the threat that @entity16 would have to be removed			0
i think the guy went into hiding			2
' never underestimate the power of the coffee morning			0
‘ he has since sold his house and has moved out			0
i telephoned the council to tell them this and was told that there would be no further action against @entity86 ’ mr @entity37 , 49 , who lives with his wife @entity87 , a midwife , and their two children , buys two roosters each year for the table but has kept @entity16 because he is a rare breed and protects his hens			1
swift exit : the newcomer who complained is thought to have gone into hiding at his £ 430,000 house , pictured , before moving out of @entity26 with his wife ' ways of the country ' : owner @entity101 , left , said he was glad the stand - off was all over and things had gone back to normal in @entity26 , right ‘ @entity16 has gone from strength to strength and is now the proud father of 30 chickens and is a bit of a local hero , ’ he said proudly			1
@entity110 , chairman of the @entity111 , said : ‘ i was horrified when somebody objected to a cockerel crowing			2
as a society we do try to preserve the village feel of the place and having a cockerel crowing is a part of village life			2
‘ i did n’t know the guy who complained but some people felt incensed by the complaint			0
‘ his was a point of view that was n’t shared with the rest of the village			0
’ a spokesman for the council confirmed that the complaint has now been dropped .			0

@entity101 was warned the council would check if the noise was excessive
outraged neighbours started a petition to save the rare cockerel
the complainant went into hiding , before moving out completely
he was branded ' *misguided* ' and ' *unfamiliar* with the ways of the country '
