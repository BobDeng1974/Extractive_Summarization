@entity1 's poles are drifting and climate change is to blame , claim scientists			1
the planet 's rotation has always wobbled slightly , and over time this movement has caused the @entity7 to shift very slightly over time			1
but researchers now believe global warming could be drastically increasing this shift			0
since 2005 , the @entity7 has shifted by 1.2 metres in an easterly direction			1
by using @entity15 satellite data , researchers from @entity13 have discovered that 90 per of this shift has been caused by climate change , including the melting of the @entity20 ice sheet , pictured , as well as the melting of mountain glaciers the @entity24 wobble is a wobbling motion that happens as the @entity1 rotates on its axis			1
it works in a similar way to how a spinning top wobbles as it slows down			0
the effect was discovered by @entity32 astronomer @entity31 in 1891			0
he found that the poles can ' wander ' by approximately 20ft to 30ft over a period of 433 days before settling			0
the wobble causes the latitude position of the geographic poles to change over this 14 - month period and this means star charts have to be updated regularly to reflect new reference points for the geographic poles			0
in 2005 , the @entity7 began to move suddenly in an easterly direction			2
using @entity15 satellite data , @entity44 researchers found that climate change , and in particular melting ice sheets , was to blame			1
using the data , scientists also predicted that as as sea levels continued to rise , the shift would also carry on			0
lead researcher @entity52 said that ‘ ice melting and sea level change can explain 90 per cent of the shift ’ and that ‘ the driving force for the sudden change is climate change			1
’ since 1899 , the @entity7 has been moving south by an average of 10cm a year along a 70 - degree west longitudinal line			2
between 1982 and 2005 , the pole drifted 6cm a year in a south - easterly direction towards northern @entity63 in @entity64			2
in 2005 , this drift abruptly changed and the @entity7 began moving to the east , towards @entity20			1
since that time it has shifted position by around 1.2 metres			1
@entity52 and colleagues studied changes in the @entity1 ’s gravity during this time period using @entity15 ’s @entity72 ( @entity72 ) satellite images			2
they were able to work out exactly how @entity1 ’s mass had moved and changed during this time and found it was caused due to the melting of the ice sheets in @entity20 and the @entity80 , which has in turn caused sea levels to rise			2
@entity52 ’s team hope that the discovery will provide scientists with a new way to measure the extent of ice sheet melting by tracing the movements of the pole			1
@entity20 's ice sheet is said to be melting at a rate of 250 gigatonnes each year			1
@entity80 is losing 180 gigatonnes of ice every year , and melting mountain glaciers adds a further 194 gigatonnes			1
these shifts in the @entity1 ’s surface were found to ‘ correlate perfectly ’ with the changes in the position of the pole			0
to understand why this sudden change occurred , researchers studied changes in the @entity1 's gravity using @entity15 's @entity72 satellite images , pictured			2
they studied changes in the @entity1 's mass caused by melting ice sheets and found they ' correlated perfectly ' with the changes in the position of the pole according to previous research , this shift is also caused by changes in the @entity1 ’s mass that have been occurring since the last ice age , affected by what ’s called the @entity24 wobble			1
the @entity24 wobble is a wobbling motion that happens as the @entity1 rotates on its axis			0
it works in a similar way to how a spinning top wobbles as it slows down , and this causes the alignment of the @entity1 ’s poles to vary in position as the planet spins			0
the wobble was discovered by @entity32 astronomer @entity31 in 1891 and the poles can ' wander ' up to approximately 20ft to 30ft off course over a period of 433 days , before settling			0
the wobble causes the latitude position of the geographic poles to circle during this 14 - month period and this means star charts have to be updated regularly to reflect new reference points for the geographic poles			0
@entity52 presented the findings at the @entity135 in @entity136 .			0

since 1899 , the @entity7 has been drifting southwards by 10cm a year
in 2005 the pole suddenly began moving east towards @entity20
in that time , the pole 's position has shifted by approximately 1.2 metres
researchers used @entity15 satellites to discover 90 *%* of this shift has been caused by climate change
this includes the melting of the @entity20 ice sheet and mountain glaciers
scientists hope that discovery will provide scientists with a new way to measure the extent of ice sheet melting
