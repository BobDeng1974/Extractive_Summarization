by @entity0 published : 03:38 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 15:43 est , 5 august 2013 survivors of the @entity3 massacre are suing the @entity5 government for allowing a jihadist soldier to rise through the ranks unchecked because of ' political correctness '			1
@entity9 , 42 , is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder for after launching an attack at the @entity16 post in november 2009			1
and on the eve of his trial , which is due to get underway on tuesday , 148 victims and their relatives are launching a legal claim against the government for $ 750million ( Â£ 491 million ) for failing to prevent the killings from happening			1
@entity36 , the lawyer acting for the group , told the @entity38 that @entity9 w as awarded ' preferential treatment ' because of his ' ethnicity and his religion '			1
he said : ' the rules on the conduct of military officers were ignored			0
he was a terrible physician and had no business treating soldiers			2
' yet , because of where he came from , and how he prayed to his god , they promoted him and set him loose and ignored his open , very obvious jihadism			0
' mr @entity51 added that the group wanted the government to meet ' its responsibilities to those harmed by its negligence ' over @entity9			1
@entity9 , pictured left in his @entity16 uniform , was apparently allowed to rise through the ranks unchecked despite his ' obvious jihadism '			1
video footage , right , shows him shopping at a 7 - 11 store wearing a traditional white jubba robe and white kufi skull cap just outside @entity3 seven hours before he shot 13 people dead @entity9 does n't deny that he carried out the november 2009 rampage at @entity3 , one of the worst mass shootings in @entity5 history			1
the attack occurred in a building where hundreds of unarmed soldiers , some about to deploy to @entity73 , were waiting for vaccines and routine checkups			2
@entity9 walked inside with two handguns , climbed onto a desk and shouted ' @entity78 ! ' - an @entity80 phrase meaning ' @entity81 is great ! ' - then he fired , pausing only to reload			2
there are dozens of witnesses who saw it happen but military law prohibits him from entering a guilty plea because authorities are seeking the death penalty			1
if @entity9 is convicted and sentenced to death there are likely years , if not decades , of appeals ahead			1
he may never make it to the death chamber at all			2
ahead of his trial , the @entity16 psychiatrist spoke to the @entity5 media for the first time last week and said that the @entity5 government is at war with @entity101			1
thirteen people were killed and 32 injured in the november 2009 shooting at @entity3 military base in @entity105 in the past , @entity9 has only spoken via telephone with @entity107 , the transcript of which is evidence in his upcoming trial			1
' my complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that it would hate for the law of @entity115 to be the supreme law of the land , ' @entity9 said in the lengthy statement released to @entity118 on saturday			2
he then says in reference to a war on @entity101 , ' i participated in it			0
' ' i would like to begin by repenting to @entity115 and apologize to the @entity122 , the believers , and the innocent			0
... i ask for their forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression against @entity130 , their religion and their lands , ' he said in the statement			0
he has twice dismissed his lawyers and now plans to represent himself at trial			0
he 's suggested he wants to argue the killings were in ' defense of others ' - namely , members of the @entity138 fighting @entity5 in @entity73			0
the trial judge , col. @entity139 , has so far denied that strategy			0
thirteen officers from around the country who hold @entity9 's rank or higher will serve on the jury for a trial that will likely last one month and probably longer			1
they must be unanimous to convict @entity9 of murder and sentence him to death			2
three - quarters of the panel must vote for an attempted murder conviction			0
no active - duty @entity5 soldier has been executed since 1961			0
the last man executed in the military system was pvt. @entity155 , hanged in 1961 for raping an 11 - year - old girl			0
five men are on the military death row at @entity159 , @entity160 , but none are close to being executed .			0

muslim @entity9 's trial is due to start on august 6
@entity16 psychiatrist ' launched attack on *fellow* soldiers ' at @entity16 base
he faces death penalty if convicted of killing 13 and wounding 32 people
