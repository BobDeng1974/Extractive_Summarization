when filling in a form , most of us are happy to be either a mr , mrs or a @entity5 but for those planning a visit to @entity9 ’s , the choice is rather grander			1
officials at the cricket ground have introduced an astonishing 52 titles for those registering online for tickets – including @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			2
not to mention @entity18 , for the most important guest of all			0
@entity21 approved : @entity9 's cricket ground has a long list of titles among its fans , including @entity18 , seen here on first day of the second test between @entity30 and @entity31 in 2013 they say they want to make all members of society feel welcome – though the majority of the list comprises aristocratic and religious titles and military ranks			1
the registration form for the 200 - year - old ground offers an extensive list of salutations to make sure all fans can select the appropriate title for their tickets to this summer ’s @entity48 test matches			1
other titles on offer include : brigadier , @entity52 , captain , commander , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity9 , @entity59 , @entity60 , and wing commander			1
however , the list is by no means comprehensive , including earls and viscounts but not dukes			0
the military ranks also exclude admirals or generals			0
a spokesman for @entity9 ’s said yesterday : ‘ we have within our membership a complete cross-section of society , including the queen who is a patron			1
firm fan : the @entity18 watches the start of the second test of the ashes between @entity30 and @entity31 in 2013 from the @entity79 at @entity9 's others who find the long list of titles useful are former cricketer @entity83 , and former prime minister sir @entity85 , a well - known fan of the sport ‘ the membership committee took the decision that they wanted all members to be able to title themselves correctly			1
’ usually ticket applications for sports events and concerts allow buyers to choose from just three titles – mr , mrs or ms. but cricket fans entering the ballot to see the @entity30 internationals against @entity31 and also @entity102 matches against @entity103 are free to select any title they wish ... which is expected to encourage a few of the more mischievous members of the public to adopt titles that do n’t belong to them			2
on the rare occasions that royalty attend test matches – the @entity18 visited the @entity9 ’s match against @entity31 in 2013 – it is unlikely they would opt to sit among the masses			2
@entity18 , and other @entity117 , would be seated in the pavilion and would not , of course , be required to buy tickets			0
the ballot for the @entity102 with @entity31 , which starts on july 16 , and a test against @entity103 in may closed at one minute to midnight last night			0
the cricket ground , in @entity123 , uses the ballot system as a fair way of allocating tickets for matches which are often oversubscribed , because it gives all applicants an equal opportunity			0
lord ’s was established in 1814 and is widely regarded as the @entity132 .			0

the online ticket registration form at @entity9 's offers *unusual* choices
titles available at @entity132 include @entity18 , @entity56 and wing commander
