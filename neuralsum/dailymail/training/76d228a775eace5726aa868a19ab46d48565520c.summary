' miss @entity1 , 48 , who starred in @entity71 and @entity72 , previously lived across the border in @entity74 when she was dating actor @entity75			0

' we do n't see a lot of @entity1 and @entity2 but maybe once the place is up to scratch they will be spending more time there			2
' i hope they get planning permission - i ca n't see many people objecting to them restoring the place to its former glory			2
' @entity102 will give a decision on whether the work can go ahead on july 11 - the day after the @entity106 series between @entity107 and @entity108 gets under way			2
they grew up thousands of miles apart but both in decidedly bland home towns			0
@entity1 was raised in @entity113 , which is nicknamed ‘ @entity117 ’ or ‘ @entity118 ’ because of the number of large roundabouts			0
it was targeted by the @entity120 during the @entity121 , but in the late 1960s the town planners carried on where the @entity123 left off by developing it into an ‘ expanded town ’			0
that resulted in many historic buildings being replaced by a shopping centre , multi-storey car park , office blocks and estates			2
miss @entity1 is believed to have grown up in a four - bedroom detached property , pictured top , in @entity113			0
it was sold several years ago for £ 415,000			0
meanwhile , @entity2 grew up in a suburban bungalow 25 miles from @entity138 , @entity108 , similar to that pictured bottom			0
@entity140 is part of a sprawling region that is home to a mix of white - and blue - collar workers , artists , writers and actors			0
in its earlier days , after the @entity121 , it was known as the ‘ end of the train line ’ , making it popular for day trippers and families taking weekly holidays			0
but by the time @entity2 was born to parents @entity157 and @entity158 in september 1969 , @entity140 had become a rather bland suburb .			0
