by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 the deaths of nine @entity5 fly - in fly - out workers who took their own lives will be investigated by a senior mental health clinician			1
@entity9 commissioner @entity8 told a public hearing on wednesday that the apparent increase in @entity13 suicides over the past 12 months was tragically not surprising			2
suicide is the single biggest killer of people aged 15 to 44 years old , while the average age of a @entity13 worker is 38 , mr @entity8 said			1
mr @entity8 said the @entity13 lifestyle also exposed workers to damaging factors including social isolation , the inability to resolve financial and family troubles , shift work , substance abuse and high risk taking behaviour			1
' you visit any mine site , the emphasis on physical health is extreme , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' if they put that sort of effort into awareness and support for mental health we 'd be far better off			1
' mr @entity8 said there was no need for an inquiry into the causes of @entity13 suicides and the services provided to workers because that was already known			1
but a case study into the deaths of nine workers , and perhaps more , was needed to better understand how they could have been helped before they took their lives			2
@entity19 was father to @entity64 and said the fly - in , fly - out nature of his work made relationships very difficult a @entity13 employee who took his life last year had spoken out about the impact of the lifestyle on mental health just days before he died			1
@entity19 , 25 , died on july 25 last year in his room at the @entity76 mine site in the @entity77 in @entity5 after suffering depression			1
the father - of - one had spoken about the cost of the @entity13 lifestyle on his mental health and wellbeing just days earlier , urging those considering @entity13 to ' rethink ' their decision			1
mr @entity19 spoke about his experience in an interview for a government - funded project on miners released by his family on the anniversary of his death to raise awareness about the risks of isolation and depression faced by @entity13 workers			1
' people do struggle up there with depression and at the moment i 'm going through it , ' mr @entity19 said in the interview			2
mr @entity19 had a young son , @entity105 , but had separated from the child 's mother			2
six weeks before he died he separated from his fiancée			0
mr @entity19 suggested @entity13 made long - term relationships difficult , saying that he would tell his son to work @entity13 only ' if he was single '			1
he said that some workers ' drink every night ' to cope with the lifestyle and named isolation as a key problem for fifo - workers			1
' you 're in your room every night of the week			0
you just think about things			0
you think about your family and what they ’re doing now ... you miss your family , ' he said			0
' there are people out there what seem to be fine , and deep down they 're not			0
people have got to realise that everyone 's not ok			0
' mr @entity19 's parents , @entity131 and @entity132 said mining companies need to do more to look after their employees			2
' everything ’s not going ok for people onsite , there ’s a huge focus on safety , but there needs to be more focus on mental wellbeing , ' ms @entity132 told @entity143			2
while she said that she does not blame @entity13 for her son 's death , she said the lifestyle does present particular mental health challenges			1
' it 's long sections away from family , missing out on major family events			0
' @entity19 typically worked three or four weeks onsite followed by one week off			2
' that 's a long time away when you 've got a child , ' said ms @entity132			0
' you 're missing major developments			0
' we ’ve suffered hugely			0
our son was just a great normal everyday guy ... and bang he ’s dead			0
it ’s just too sad , ' she said			0
after @entity19 ( right ) took his life , his family , including his stepfather @entity162 ( centre ) have campaigned to raise awareness of themental health issues faced by fly - in , fly - out workers @entity168 , @entity169 , conducted a study of mental health among 900 @entity13 workers last year			1
he found that while @entity13 workers did not experience a higher rate of mental health issues compared to the rest of @entity5 citizens , they did experience specific hardships relating to mental health			1
' a key concern for us out of that study was often the attitude among the workforce that it was somehow soft to say that you 're having troubles , ' he told @entity143			0
' it was summed up in a phrase from one our interviews that " if you were having troubles in your life , you just had to suck it up princess "			2
that was a very unhelpful attitude , that can prevent people from seeking help			0
' the @entity198 are now raising awareness of the mental health problems facing @entity13 workers			1
ms @entity132 and @entity19 's sister @entity201 are working with zero2hero , a suicide prevention charity , and mr @entity162 recently visited @entity204 workers to speak about mental health issues			1
' [ @entity19 ] was just a normal larrikin young guy who loved life , ' said ms @entity132			2
' he was a water polo player , he had lots of friends			0
he was just a nice guy and he was a selfless person			0
' we ca n't change what ’s happened in our case , but maybe we can change what happens in someone else 's case			0
