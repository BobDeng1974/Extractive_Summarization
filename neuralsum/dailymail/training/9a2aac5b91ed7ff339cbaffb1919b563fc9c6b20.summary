by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 05:22 est , 15 february 2013 killed by drinking too much water : @entity2 went into a coma when his salt levels dropped dangerously low after he downed seven litres of water a man died from drinking too much water after his alcohol may have been ' spiked with ecstasy ' , an inquest heard			1
@entity2 , 29 , developed a sudden craving for water and drank around seven litres - the equivalent of 14 pints - within a few hours before he began to have fits and collapsed at home			1
the heating and ventilation engineer was rushed to hospital but the salt levels in his body had sunk so low he suffered brain damage , went into a coma and died seven months later			1
his mother @entity22 , 63 , said after the hearing : ' he would n't have taken ecstasy himself			0
it must have been slipped into his drink for him to want to have so much water			2
he would drink a glass of water like anybody else but at normal levels , not to that extent			2
' mr @entity2 had been out drinking with friends on the evening of @entity34 in 2010 and was admitted to hospital drunk and described as ' walking around going mad , pressing imaginary buttons '			1
when he sobered up he was discharged on december 27 and was taken home by his father @entity38 , 67 , and his elder brother @entity39 , 36			0
his brother told the @entity42 inquest : ' he was sat down on the settee			2
his pupils were absolutely massive and he was unsteady on his feet			0
he looked like he had taken something			0
' i have seen him drunk on occasions but that is the first time i have seen him looking like that			2
' the next day mr @entity2 started on his water binge			1
his brother continued : ' he was drinking it to the point where we noticed it was a bit abnormal			0
he was sat on the settee and started sweating , really sweating			0
i told him to take his coat off and he went upstairs			0
' he got to the sink and went to have another glass of water			0
i told him it was dangerous to drink so much water , he just laughed it off			0
' tragic : mr @entity2 was rushed to the @entity64 in @entity42 where he was given saline solution to try and boost his salt levels but he died seven months later his brother then had to stop @entity2 falling downstairs as he collapsed and began having fits			1
he was taken to @entity42 's @entity64 on december 28 and briefly made a recovery before he relapsed and died on august 4 , 2011			1
dr @entity69 , consultant in anaesthesia , said mr @entity2 suffered an acute drop in his blood sodium levels from a normal level of 142 on @entity34 to a critical 107 two days later			1
he said : ' you have to be given or take on a lot of water for that			0
it occurs in people who for whatever reason drink a lot of water very quickly			0
' the drop was equivalent to about six or seven litres of water			2
he said it could have been associated with taking ecstasy but added : ' what made him drink excess quantities of water i do n't know			0
' doctors tried to correct his low sodium level by giving him concentrated doses of saline solution to reduce a swelling on his brain as if left untreated he would have died then			1
dr @entity69 said a combination of the low sodium , the brain swelling and the seizures all contributed to his ' extreme ' form of brain injury			2
he said : ' all this stems from drinking too much water			2
' dr @entity107 , neuropathology consultant , said mr @entity2 suffered a rare brain condition called extrapontine myelinolysis , a brain cell dysfunction which destroys the layer covering the nerve cells in the brain stem			1
the widespread brain damage was related to the swelling and seizures associated with his low blood sodium levels caused by drinking too much water			1
@entity120 dr @entity119 gave the cause of death as a chest infection contributed to by a lack of oxygen to the brain and drug and alcohol abuse			0
@entity2 's father @entity38 , 67 , of @entity130 , @entity42 , said when he and @entity39 brought @entity131 home he spent the rest of the day watching television on the sofa			1
they only noticed him drinking copious amounts of water the next day and by 7pm he had collapsed			1
his friend could not tell the family why @entity2 had suddenly become so ill. @entity141 said : ' when he was in hospital he had lost his laughter and was no longer the comedian			1
it was a terrible shame to see him in that hospital bed			0
' assistant deputy coroner @entity147 said : ' it is probable that the cause of death has arisen from some deliberate human act which has gone wrong			0
' afterwards @entity152 of @entity153 , @entity42 said : ' i just want people to know that drinking too much water can be dangerous			1
i hope @entity2 's death was not in vain and that somebody else might be saved			2
' the coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure .			0
