the @entity0 has declared that it will not allow mobile phones - especially iphones and @entity5 's @entity4 - onto @entity0 bound planes from some airports in @entity8 , the @entity9 and @entity10 if the devices are not charged			1
the new measure , which is bound to cause chaotic scenes at airports around the globe , is part of the @entity0 @entity17 's effort to boost surveillance amid concerns that terrorists are plotting to blow up an airliner			1
as part of the increased scrutiny at certain airports , security agents may ask travelers to turn on their electronic devices at checkpoints and if they do not have power , the devices will not be allowed on planes , the @entity17 said			1
@entity0 officials are concerned that a cellphone , tablet , laptop or other electronic device could be used as a bomb by @entity56 - based @entity55 and the @entity57 , @entity55 's affiliate in @entity58			1
in 2009 a @entity56 - linked bomb - maker , @entity60 , built an underwear bomb used in the failed effort to bring down a @entity64 - bound airliner , and his devices were implicated in other plots			0
the @entity57 , @entity35 ’s affiliate involved in fighting with @entity58 rebels to overthrow president @entity69 , is also thought to be plotting an airliner attack , according to intelligence reports			0
the @entity17 did not disclose which airports would be conducting the additional screening , however it was reported last week that passengers at @entity76 airports traveling to the @entity0 are facing extra checks on phones			1
an official told the @entity80 that @entity82 's @entity81 was among the airports			0
@entity0 officials singled out smartphones including iphones made by @entity86 and @entity4 phones made by @entity5 for extra security checks on @entity0 - bound direct flights from @entity8 , the @entity9 and @entity10			1
special attention : the @entity17 in the @entity0 has announced that @entity92 and @entity4 phones will come under strict scrutiny @entity0 security officials said they fear bombmakers from the @entity56 - based @entity55 ( @entity55 ) have figured out how to turn the phones into explosive devices that can avoid detection			1
they also are concerned that hard - to - detect bombs could be built into shoes , said the officials , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue			2
a @entity0 official said that other electronic devices carried by passengers also are likely to receive more intense scrutiny and travellers may be asked to power up laptops , @entity110 , tablets and @entity112			2
a @entity17 statement said : ‘ as the travelling public knows , all electronic devices are screened by security officers			2
‘ during the security examination , officers may also ask that owners power up some devices , including cell phones			1
‘ powerless devices will not be permitted onboard the aircraft			0
the traveller may also undergo additional screening			1
’ airlines or airport operators that fail to strengthen security could face bans on flights entering the @entity0 , the officials said			1
the @entity0 @entity132 announced on wednesday plans to step up security checks , but they offered few details on how airlines and airports will implement them			2
strict : the @entity17 will not allow cellphones or other electronic devices on @entity0 - bound planes from now on @entity0 homeland security secretary @entity141 said at the time : ‘ we will work to ensure these necessary steps pose as few disruptions to travellers as possible			1
’ an official familiar with the matter said the @entity0 believes that while it is possible there may be some additional delays at security checkpoints , at most major airports passengers will not be seriously inconvenienced			1
the official said most passengers taking long - distance flights arrive well in advance of scheduled departures , leaving time for extra screening			2
but he said the @entity0 could not rule out disruptions in countries where airport infrastructure and security procedures are less sophisticated			2
in his weekly radio phone - in programme , deputy prime minister @entity163 warned last week that travellers may have to get used to the extra checks			0
‘ i do n’t think we should expect this to be a one - off temporary thing , ’ he said			0
‘ we have to make sure the checks are there to meet the nature of the new kinds of threats			0
’ ‘ whether it is for ever – i ca n’t make any predictions			0
but i do n’t want people to think that this is just a sort of a blip for a week			0
this is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks keep up with the nature of the threats			0
’ @entity0 - based airlines had little to say about the enhanced security			0
@entity189 spokesman @entity188 said the @entity132 had been in contact with @entity0 on the issue , but declined to comment further			0
on guard : western nations have stepped up security at airports after @entity0 officials said they were concerned that @entity55 operatives in @entity58 and @entity56 were developing bombs that could be smuggled onto planes @entity200 , a spokesman for @entity201 said : ' we work closely with federal officials on security matters , but we are not able to discuss the details of those efforts			1
' @entity0 security agencies fear bombmakers from @entity55 and the @entity57 , @entity55 's affiliate in @entity58 , are collaborating on plots to attack @entity0 - or @entity8 - bound planes with bombs concealed on foreign fighters carrying @entity215 passports , the officials said			1
@entity55 has a track record of plotting such attacks			0
its innovative bombmaker , @entity60 , built an underwear bomb used in a failed 2009 effort to bring down a @entity64 - bound airliner , and his devices were implicated in other plots			0
there was no immediate indication @entity0 intelligence had detected a specific plot or timeframe for any attack			0
