by @entity0 an @entity2 high school denied its graduating seniors their diplomas after they threw their caps in the air during their commencement ceremony after they were told not to			1
the day after the celebration , staff at @entity9 in @entity10 wrote on its website that class representatives would have to apologize for the ' disrespectful and insubordinate behavior ' if they wanted the students to receive their diplomas			1
superintendent dr. @entity16 wrote a blog post about the incident to the students at the school , which appropriately has the slogan ' @entity22 ' , referring to their athletic team			1
the blog said the students had been warned against throwing the caps because the age - old tradition was dangerous that could leave students ' with cuts and black eyes '			1
' " please do not throw the caps or there will be consequences			1
" the graduates heard this and made their choice to mar what should have been a joyous event			0
' perhaps it is the final lesson they will take away from high school : there are consequences for behaviors in life			1
if you are unwilling to face those consequences , perhaps you should rethink your actions			2
' the blog has since been removed and after the decision sparked outcry - with many students saying the school were being unfair or taking the celebration too seriously - the school reversed its decision			1
' regarding the distribution of diplomas ; we recognize that most of those who participated in the graduation ceremonies were well - behaved and followed instructions , ' an announcement said			2
dr. @entity16 said they needed to know there were consequences for their actions ' i am sorry that the ceremony was marred by a few students who chose not to follow those instructions			2
' consequently , we have re-thought our policy and will be sending out diplomas to all members of the class of 2014 today			0
' the students have previously expressed their disappointment after school staff refused to hand out diplomas			1
' i just think it â€™s really ridiculous , ' @entity93 told @entity95			0
' we worked so hard to get to this point			0
' ' it was kind of silly that they would request them not to , ' parent @entity97 added			0
' it was n't a way to disrespect anyone , it was just a way to do something together and celebrate the end of the year			0
' scene : a day after the decision was announced , staff reversed it and said students could have their diplomas comments on @entity16 's blog also called the decision ' the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard '			1
' maybe it is you , dr. @entity16 , that needs to grow up , ' the comment said			0
but other commenters agreed with the decision , with one saying : ' children need to learn from their actions			0
and at this point they are still children			0
' before the reversal , the students were told that they could collect their diplomas if class representatives apologized at a meeting on june 4			2
this is no longer necessary			0
