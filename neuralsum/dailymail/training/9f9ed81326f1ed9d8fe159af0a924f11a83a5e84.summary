things got ugly : the 30 - inch pipe burst beneath @entity12 , sending a geyser many feet into the air and shutting down the major thoroughfare and causing chaos on @entity20 campus sinkhole : the pipe left a 15 - foot crater in @entity12 in addition to about 10 million gallons of wasted water to clean up ' we â€™re currently in the drying process , ' he told @entity87			1
he said , despite the 8 - 10 inches of water that were there last night , the floor is ' showing little signs of buckling and expansion			1
' firefighters dispatched to the scene helped five people to safety on tuesday as water poured into the garage buildings , and no injuries were reported			2

the 93 - year - old riveted steel pipe , 30 inches in diameter , normally carries an estimated 75,000 gallons of water per minute from a reservoir to @entity10 's @entity138 neighborhood and appears to have broken at the junction of another water trunk line , the utility said			1
@entity22 general superintendent for water distribution @entity142 described the repair process to @entity87 as ' very complex			0
' water rushes down @entity20 campus stairs after a water main ruptured nearby and sent 10 million gallons of precious @entity149 fresh water across campus scary situation : @entity10 city fire search and rescue walking under falling water to a lower level parking lot to check for any victims @entity22 filled stairs to a parking structure adjacent to the main entry doors of @entity45 , home of @entity20 basketball big problem : millions of gallons of water flowed across the school 's athletic facilities , including the famed floor of @entity45 , the neighboring @entity55 and the @entity56 , and a pair of parking structures that took the brunt of the damage massive breach : a man poses for a photo on stairs to a parking structure outside @entity20 's @entity45 sporting arena as water flows down from a broken thirty inch water main that was gushing water onto @entity12 in @entity138 ' the location of the leak is creating issues for us as far as the location of the pipe , ' he told the @entity186 affiliate			1
' normally , a break of this size , we would just go in and cut out a section of pipe and replace it real quick			0
but this is located where two large - diameter pipes come together			0
' the rupture underscored the aging condition of much of the city 's infrastructure			0
