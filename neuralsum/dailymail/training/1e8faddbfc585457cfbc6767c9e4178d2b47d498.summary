by @entity0 published : 20:25 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 12:50 est , 11 march 2013 he has a reputation for lateness , but @entity4 excelled himself when he turned up four hours behind schedule for filming on @entity7 ’s @entity6 last week			1
sometimes there is an excuse for such shoddy behaviour			2
for example , he will plead he has had a migraine , as he did last month when he was five hours late			1
at other times he will say , infuriatingly but truthfully , he was soaking in the bath while everyone was waiting for him			2
the show got 2.7million viewers on its first outing - around half of what might be expected in its plum slot on this occasion , apparently , he did n’t even offer an excuse			1
as you might imagine , this habit infuriates his fellow judges and the army of producers and technicians who end up working until nearly midnight to accommodate his eccentric schedule			2
but @entity4 , once so insecure he needed a friend to help him walk past the bank of secretaries at the record company @entity45 , can suffer from curious black moods			1
his fear of failure is well known — some friends such as the retail billionaire sir @entity50 have confided that they almost nod off during his long introspective monologues about his career			0
and , right now , there are lots of reasons for the so - called @entity56 of popular culture to feel lacking in confidence			2
he has just seen the worst - ever ratings for the launch show of any tv programme that he has been behind — with the painfully derivative format of his latest primetime offering , @entity19			1
puffed out : @entity4 has been cruelly dubbed ' @entity65 ' in newspaper headlines after viewers noticed his face appeared puffy it got a dismal 2.7 million viewers on its first outing on @entity72 , and 2.4 million on wednesday night last week			1
that ’s about half what you might expect in a plum slot after @entity78			0
this was particularly galling for @entity4 , as he was heavily involved in the concept and execution of the show			1
he said before it went out that he was ‘ really nervous ’ , and conceded that success or failure in tv was ‘ all about ratings in the end ’			1
the past 12 months have seen a succession of failures			0
starting with an ‘ unauthorised ’ biography about him by respected author @entity93 — with whom he co-operated — it has been an unhappy year			0
his tv talent shows have started to look tired and lose audiences , his new ideas have n’t taken root , his judges keep on quitting , and he has fallen into a fractious relationship with the tv networks who are his paymasters			1
on a personal level , he has struggled to get a grip with his weight or his addiction to cigarettes and remains , at 53 , single and dependent on ex-girlfriends — some of them on his payroll — for company			0
one old friend told me : ‘ his success has been unparalleled , but in the end he is a victim of it , because it ’s fading away and he seems unable to do anything to stop it			0
’ there are worrying stories of @entity4 , long known for his hypochondriac reliance on vitamins and smoothie health drinks , developing serious anxieties over germs			1
apparently he throws away teaspoons if they have been used to eat yogurt for fear of bacteria , and has installed gel hand sanitiser units in his dressing room			0
it ’s all a little bit like the infamous @entity139 recluse @entity138			0
more seriously , some media analysts believe his annus horribilis may be the beginning of the end of what has been a promethean career			0
@entity146 , a former programmes boss at @entity148 , summed up @entity4 ’s success to me , saying that he ‘ was the right person in the right place at the right time			1
but that does n’t mean that he has a tin of fairy dust and can do it again ’			0
so what has gone wrong ? clash : hiring @entity158 as an x factor judge alongside @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 was the decision of @entity72 and against @entity4 's wishes the publication of the @entity167 book , @entity168 , seems to have been his first misstep			1
it featured some headline - grabbing revelations — such as his affair with x factor judge @entity173 and about him feeling manipulated by a flirtatious @entity175			2
yet @entity4 was deeply embarrassed by the revelations and by the schoolboy - ish comments attributed to him when he lusted after @entity178 and his nights of passion with @entity173			1
in its immediate wake , there were clashes over the hiring of @entity158 as a judge for @entity187 , which was the decision of @entity72 and against @entity4 ’s wishes			1
and his relationship with the network was soured further last may when @entity190 , who had been his right - hand woman since 2004 , left his company @entity191 to work for @entity72			2
in her new job , she devises and then puts on screen new entertainment formats for the network , meaning she is in direct competition with her old boss			0
he was so rattled he rang @entity72 executive @entity198 to remonstrate about them taking ms @entity190 from him			0
a few weeks after that call , @entity4 was bedridden with what seems to have been a near - breakdown			1
he took six weeks off work			0
blow : it is now said that @entity72 sees @entity206 as more important to the success of @entity7 's @entity6 @entity4 later confided to friends that the long - term pressure of running his empire on both sides of the @entity213 — the time difference is up to eight hours — had turned him into a ‘ weird vampire ’ , answering texts and messages through the night			1
within days of returning to work — launching @entity218 — he was smoking constantly and working 20 - hour days			2
nor has the @entity139 show been a success			2
despite installing @entity222 on the judging panel , it performed poorly , losing three million viewers compared with the previous year			2
and viewers noticed something had happened to @entity4 ’s face			1
his cheeks were puffy and he seemed to have acquired a double chin			0
he was called ‘ @entity65 ’ , and one publication asked : ‘ what ’s happened to @entity4 ’s face — and is it just for @entity234 ? ’ @entity4 did n’t find it funny			1
the problem , according to a source in @entity237 , was he had put on 15lb through comfort - eating , while continuing to have @entity241 injections and plumping face - fillers			2
he has been seen in the @entity244 health food store near his @entity237 home spending more than 45 minutes studying vitamins and supplements			0
each day he has three ‘ super ’ smoothies for breakfast ( in search of eternal youth )			0
the recipes have been devised by @entity255 scientists and ingredients include lingonberry , acerola berry and chokeberry			0
once a week , he has an intravenous drip that administers vitamin @entity261 , vitamin c , magnesium , and , in his words , ‘ something for your liver ’			0
last september , he also hired a personal trainer			0
but he detests training sessions and they have n’t had the desired result of helping him to shift the weight			0
an old friend told me : ‘ he is a real contradiction : he smokes and he ca n’t sleep , and he lives a completely workaholic bachelor lifestyle , which is very bad for him			0
but then he has every health fad going			0
he claims they balance each other out ! ’ the big question is : would he approach life in quite such an extreme manner if his television shows were all a roaring success ? the last series of @entity187 in the @entity7 was the least watched since 2007 and the final had the worst rating in seven years			1
it was beaten consistently by @entity288 on @entity289			0
@entity290 , a gameshow with @entity206 aired last september , was also a massive and expensive flop			0
@entity4 has also fallen out with some of his star hirings			1
@entity158 , @entity222 and record producer @entity294 mutter they do n’t want to continue , and @entity4 has said he does n’t want @entity161 to return as an x factor judge			1
falling out : there have been mutterings that star hiring @entity222 does not want to continue on the @entity139 version of x-factor			0
@entity4 is said to be keen on hiring @entity302 and @entity303 to replace her he is trying to assemble two ‘ dream team ’ judging panels for @entity187 on both sides of the @entity213			1
in @entity139 , he is keen to see @entity302 and @entity303 behind the judges ’ desk			2
in the @entity7 , the new series may be presided over by @entity158 , @entity310 , @entity162 and singer @entity311			1
in a further blow to @entity4 ’s ego , it is now said @entity72 sees @entity206 as more important to the success of the @entity7 show , and @entity4 could face a pay cut when they renegotiate the terms of his production deal			1
@entity146 , now a media analyst , says : ‘ what happened with @entity187 is that @entity4 had his moment			1
his personality , and his background in the music industry , and his work ethic and his instinct were all perfect			0
‘ but although @entity187 and @entity7 ’s @entity6 have been very successful shows , they are petering out , just like the talent shows that went before them			1
it is cyclical and you can not fight it			0
’ that wo n’t stop @entity4 trying			1
he has just announced a global talent show , to be screened on @entity336 , from the end of this month			2
he is also working on a family tv concept , an updated @entity339 , which he plans to pitch in the coming weeks to @entity72 and the @entity289			2
at some point , though , the man who is a tireless perfectionist and puts himself under such tremendous pressure , must be forced to realise it is impossible for anyone to remain the best at everything .			0
