' i tell you on behalf of all citizens of @entity13 ... we are tired of this drug trafficking , ' he said			2
@entity23 ' @entity3 , the head of @entity4 's @entity24 , remains jailed in @entity4 and @entity4 authorities have n't said if they might extradite him to @entity13 the case is regarded as one of the @entity1 government 's most important against @entity4 cartels			1

' i ask you for forgiveness and for you to have pity on me , ' he told the judge			0

' early at monday 's hearing , @entity17 repeatedly asked the question : ' who is this defendant ?
