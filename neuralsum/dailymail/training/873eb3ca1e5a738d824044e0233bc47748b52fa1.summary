due to its complex nature , scientists have only really been unravelling the mysteries of the brain over the last few decades			0
and now researchers have discovered that the brains of mice contain at least seven unknown types of cells , including a nerve cell			1
these findings are significant because they could shed light on diseases such as multiple sclerosis , explained the researchers			0
researchers have discovered a number of unknown types of brain cells , including a nerve cell , in the brains of mice			1
they used a process called single cell sequencing to produce a detailed map of brain cell types			1
the finding could shed more light on the human brain ( a stock image of human brain cells are shown ) using a process called single cell sequencing , scientists at the @entity30 in @entity31 produced a detailed map of brain cell types and the genes active within them			1
it is the first time the method has been used on such a large scale and on such a complex tissue			1
researchers studied more than 3,000 cells , one at a time , to identify a number of previously unknown types			1
‘ if you compare the brain to a fruit salad , you could say that previous methods were like running the fruit through a blender and seeing what colour juice you got from different parts of the brain , ’ said @entity45 , senior researcher at the @entity46 and @entity47			0
researchers studied more than 3,000 cells , one at a time , and managed to identify a number of previously unknown types			2
they then compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each cell , which enabled them to sort the cells into virtual piles			0
from this , the experts were able to identify 47 different kinds of cell scientists analysed 3,000 cells from the cerebral cortex in mice			1
they then compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each cell , which enabled them to sort the cells into virtual piles			0
from this , the experts were able to identify 47 different kinds of cell			2
these included specialised neurons , blood vessel cells and glial cells , which take care of waste products , protect against infection and supply nerve cells with nutrients			2
they also discovered unknown cell types , including a nerve cell in the outermost layer of the cortex			1
six different types of unknown oligodendrocyte , which are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells , were also identified			1
‘ but in recent years we 've developed much more sensitive methods of analysis that allow us to see which genes are active in individual cells			0
‘ this is like taking pieces of the fruit salad , examining them one by one and then sorting them into piles to see how many different kinds of fruit it contains , what they 're made up of and how they interrelate			0
’ the discovery that all living organisms are made of cells was discovered almost 200 years ago by @entity116 scientists			0
since then , researchers have learnt that the nature of a particular body tissue is determined by its cells , which are determined by what genes are active in their dna			2
however , little is still known about how this happens in detail , especially in the body ’s most complex organ - the brain			0
after the scientist analysed the 3,000 cells from the cerebral cortex in mice , they compared which of the 20,000 genes were active in each one , enabling them to sort the cells into virtual piles			0
they identified 47 different kinds of cell , including a large proportion of specialised neurons , as well as blood vessel cells and glial cells , which take care of waste products , protect against infection and supply nerve cells with nutrients			1
the researchers identified unknown cell types , including a nerve cell plus six different types of oligodendrocyte			1
these are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells			2
a stock image of cross sections of myelin sheaths surrounding axons of the central nervous system are shown then , they identified unknown cell types , including a nerve cell in the outermost layer of the cortex plus six different types of oligodendrocyte			1
these are cells that form the electrically insulating myelin sheath around the nerve cells			2
the study , published in the journal @entity175 , could shed more light on diseases that affect the myelin - or white matter - such as multiple sclerosis			0
the disease is caused by the destruction of the white matter that forms a sheath around the axons of the central nervous system			0
' @entity185 ' leaves scars or ' plaques ' that cause various symptoms , including declining visual clarity , difficulty moving and speech problems			0
co-leader of the study , @entity195 , said : ‘ we have created a much more detailed map of the cells of the brain that describes each cell type in detail and shows which genes are active in it			1
‘ this gives science a new tool for studying these cell types in disease models and helps us to understand better how brain cell respond to disease and injury			2
’ there are estimated to be 100 million cells in a mouse brain , and 65 billion in a human brain .			0

@entity31 researchers found seven unknown cells in the brains of mice
they used single cell sequencing to create a detailed map of the brain
this map included various cell types as well as the genes within them
it is the first time the method has been used on such a complex tissue
using the map , experts identified 47 different kinds of cell
this included six different types of unknown oligodendrocyte - cells that insulate nerve cells - as well as an unknown nerve cell
