presumably nobody at @entity1 explained to @entity2 how the @entity4 fixture list works			1
if they had , he surely would n't be complaining about the number of matches in december			0
@entity1 started a run of nine games in 36 days with the 3 - 0 win over @entity11 on saturday and the @entity12 has had a good old whinge about the packed schedule and the fact he ca n't spend @entity17 at home in the armchair in the corner			1
‘ i ’m not happy but i can not change it , ’ said @entity21 , whose team face @entity23 on tuesday			1
‘ i do n’t agree with it because i do n’t think that it is good for the players that they play another match within two days			2
in december , it shall be like that			0
a stern - faced @entity2 before @entity1 's victory over @entity11 on saturday the @entity12 has had a whinge about the packed schedule in december @entity1 face a busy @entity17 schedule which could well define their season ‘ we also have families			1
i also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and i can not see them this @entity17			0
' but i want to work in the @entity43 , i have to adapt and i shall adapt			0
but i do n’t think it is good for players , neither for the families			0
’ here 's the smallest violin in the world @entity49 , just for you			0
what @entity21 , who has now presided over a whopping 14 competitive fixtures in around four months , forgets is that it 's the same for everyone			0
@entity56 , for instance , have 11 matches in the next month , including @entity59 third - round weekend			1
it 's not like @entity1 's players will be overburdened in the new year , either , seeing as they failed to qualify for @entity62 and were dumped out of the @entity63 by @entity64			1
there have been a lot of injuries but the ludicrously lop - sided buying policy ( carried out by a mr a van @entity2 , no less ) has not helped			2
and let 's face it , when january rolls around @entity21 could get another £ 100million to chuck around on new players if anyone picks up a bad injury , despite senior figures at the club insisting there will be no spending in the upcoming transfer window			2
the festive fixture list is one of the things that makes @entity4 football great , so the @entity12 will just have to lump it as he continues to adapt to his not - so new surroundings			2
and he can console himself with the thought that by the time this 36 - day spell is over he will have earned £ 690,000 - plenty of money with which to buy presents for those neglected family members			0
@entity21 has also bemoaned the fact that he will not be able to spend @entity17 with his family			1

@entity1 started a run of nine matches in 36 days on saturday
@entity2 says playing so many matches is n't good for the players
@entity12 also complains that he ca n't spend @entity17 with his family
it 's the same for all his rivals - @entity56 have 11 matches in next month
