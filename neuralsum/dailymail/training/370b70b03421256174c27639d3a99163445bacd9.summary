by @entity0 last updated at 6:41 pm on 10th january 2012 @entity2 president @entity1 vowed to strike against ‘ terrorists ’ with an iron fist today and blamed a foreign conspiracy for trying to destabilise @entity2			1
as the mass uprising continued against his rule with security forces accused of shooting dead 10 people , the beleaguered mr @entity1 derided the @entity10 for its attempts to halt violence in the 10 - month - old revolt against his rule			1
the president 's 100 - minute speech , his first public address since june , contained vague promises of reform , but no sweeping concessions that might split an opposition now determined to end more than four decades of domination by the @entity23			1
@entity24 handed : @entity2 president @entity1 today refused to step down and vowed to meet any further unrest with an ' iron fist ' keeping an eye out : @entity2 across the country watched president @entity1 's address on television and mr @entity1 , 46 , gave no hint that he was willing to relinquish the power he inherited on his father 's death in 2000 promising : ‘ i am not someone who abandons responsibility			1
' i am in this position because of support from the people and if i leave it will be because of the desire of the people			2
‘ our priority now is to regain security which we basked in for decades , and this can only be achieved by hitting the terrorists with an iron hand … we will not be lenient with those who work with outsiders against the country			2
’ the hardline speech came as @entity55 , @entity2 ’s neighbour and one time friend , warned of civil war and @entity59 said it is making preparations for the fall of mr @entity1 and a flood of refugees into the captured @entity64			2
contrast : @entity1 's speech came the day after anti-government protesters carried the coffin of @entity69 , who they say was killed during clashes in @entity71 pro : meanwhile , there is some support for @entity1 , as this girl demonstrates carrying a placard with his picture and the @entity78 slogan ' we 're all with you ' in a scathing attack on the @entity10 , which has sent monitors to check @entity2 's compliance with an @entity85 peace plan after suspending it from the 22 - member body in november , he said : ‘ @entity10 has failed for six decades to take a position in the @entity85 interest ... we should not be surprised			1
’ he said @entity2 would not ' close the door ' to any @entity85 proposal that respected its sovereignty and unity			0
@entity2 death toll graphic @entity2 , mr @entity1 complained , was the target of a relentless foreign media campaign			2
blaming unrest on ‘ outside planning ’ , he said , ‘ the outside now regrettably includes @entity85			0
‘ we will declare victory soon , mr @entity1 said , raising fears the military crackdown was about to increase			0
‘ when i leave this post , it will be also based upon the people 's wishes , ’ he added			1
the address broadcast live from @entity110 was a clear message there would be no concessions and little was going to change despite international calls for sweeping reforms and mr @entity1 to stand down			1
the @entity116 said last month that more than 5,000 civilians have been killed since protests began last march with repeated reports of snipers cutting down men , women and children			0
@entity2 authorities say they are fighting armed groups – there is evidence that army deserters have joined the opposition and are targeting government forces – and that around 2,000 members of their own security forces have been killed so far			0
activists claimed @entity2 security forces shot dead at least 10 people in an eastern city of @entity137 yesterday despite the presence of the @entity85 observer mission in the area			2
mr @entity1 ’s approach to unrest , casting it as a foreign conspiracy and countering it with violent repression and hazy promises of reform , resembled that of other @entity85 leaders confronted by mass protests in the past year			1
despite the persistent upheaval in @entity2 , in which insurgent attacks have begun to eclipse civilian demonstrations , mr @entity1 's security forces seem to retain the upper hand			2
mr @entity1 acknowledged some ‘ wrong actions ’ by the authorities but despite the high casualty toll , he denied any policy to shoot demonstrators			0
‘ there is no cover for anyone			0
there are no orders for anyone to open fire on any citizen , ’ he stressed			0
opposition officials dismissed the contents of the speech			0
‘ @entity1 is completely removed from reality , as if he is talking about a country other than @entity2 , ’ said a @entity2 - based activist who identified himself by his nickname , @entity175 , because of fear of reprisals			1
‘ after 10 months of bloodshed , he comes out and talks of a foreign conspiracy			1
’ aftermath : a suicide bomber earlier this week killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens more in the @entity186 district in central @entity71 investigation : several riot shields were visible in a wrecked police bus behind this destroyed vehicle in the suicide blast earlier this week standing room only : hundreds of thousands of @entity2 have taken to the country 's streets to demand the end of the current regime , such as during this protest at the end of december huge : the protest at the end of december was believed to be the biggest ever series of protests against president @entity1 @entity202 , head of the opposition @entity203 , warned that mr @entity1 ’s emphasis on restoring order meant he is ‘ backing away from his own pledge to the @entity10 plan			1
’ he described mr @entity1 's speech as dangerous because he had ‘ insisted on using violence against our people , considered the revolution a terrorist conspiracy and thus undercut any @entity85 or @entity212 initiative to find a political solution to the crisis ’			1
reviewing progress since the 165 monitors began work on december 26 – two were injured in protests last week , the @entity10 said on sunday @entity2 had only partly kept an agreement to stop violence , withdraw troops from cities , free prisoners , provide media access and open a political dialogue			0
escalating : anger is growing as tens of thousands continue to protest against the regime of president @entity1 anger : clashes have broken out over the last 10 months between @entity2 security forces and unarmed protesters many of mr @entity1 's critics say the @entity85 monitoring mission has failed to halt the bloodshed and is only giving the authorities more time to crack down on protesters			1
the struggle in @entity2 , @entity245 's only @entity85 ally , has alarmed its neighbours : @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity55 , @entity59 and @entity249			0
@entity55 prime minister @entity250 , a former friend of @entity1 who has become one of his fiercest critics , warned yesterday : ‘ the situation in @entity2 is heading towards a religious , sectarian , racial war , and this needs to be prevented			0
’ meanwhile , @entity59 ’s military chief , lieutenant - general @entity256 , told a parliamentary committee yesterday : ‘ @entity1 can not continue to hold onto power … on the day that the regime falls , it is expected to result in a blow to the @entity262 sect			2
we are preparing to take in @entity262 refugees on the @entity64			0
' @entity59 should also prepare for the possibility that cornered authorities in @entity71 could ' as a lifesaver ... act against us ' , the general added .			0

@entity1 insisted he still had his people 's support
claimed foreign conspiracy and terrorists behind 10 - month - old uprising
criticised @entity10 which is currently monitoring country
