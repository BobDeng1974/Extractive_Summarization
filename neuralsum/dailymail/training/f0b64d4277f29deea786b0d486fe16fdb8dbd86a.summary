setting out a tough regime of checks on doctors ’ surgeries , @entity1 warned those that provide poor care could face big fines and even closure			1
professor field , who is chief inspector of primary care , said that lazy medics who do not stay open for long enough risk being punished			1
he said : ‘ i will not hesitate at all to order the closure of @entity22 practices that we find to be unsafe , or providing poor access , or which do not care for patients properly or treat them with dignity			2
’ while acknowledging the high standard of care provided by most gps , he said surgeries should provide care seven days a week and described opening hours as ‘ patchy ’			1
ahead of the introduction of a ratings system for gp surgeries , @entity16 said one in ten surgeries will need to make significant improvements			1
he told the @entity37 newspaper : ‘ while we ’ve got some of the best general practices in the world , it ’s let down by a small percentage of practices which are n’t providing appropriate access or quality of care			0
’ speaking about the need for longer opening hours , he added : ‘ access should be brilliant , but currently it ’s patchy			1
‘ a lot of patients are dissatisfied with current access and think it ’s inadequate			0
it seems to be a huge source of frustration			0
‘ we should move to seven - day services in general practice , where patients should be able to access a gp for advice at the weekend			2
’ professor field , who works as a gp in @entity62 , said that patients holding down nine - to - five jobs struggled to make appointments			2
pointing to the rising numbers of surgeries offering appointments later in the evenings and at weekends , he said such working practices should be commonplace			0

professor @entity1 listed out - of - hours care as one of his biggest concerns saying patients seem to be ' frustrated ' with the current opening hours of @entity22 's surgeries ' we need those in power and authority to understand that and not constantly berate gps and get the stick out			1
’ health secretary @entity108 echoed professor field ’s message , saying gp salaries could be slashed if they fail to look after the elderly			2
he was speaking as new gp contracts are being drawn up , suggesting that he has ‘ no problem paying gps well ’ if they give good care			0
‘ we need to change the model for reactive primary care to proactive primary care and that ’s rediscovering the idea of family doctoring , and the idea of a gp who keeps tabs on people whether or not they ’re ill , ’ he told the @entity117			0
‘ we need to be much more ambitious about how people access the system in ways that cost the system a lot less			0
‘ we ’re trapped in a mentality where the heart of primary care provision is a ten - minute gp appointment when actually if you look at what happens in the @entity140 , they find that if you allow people to ask questions by email it is cheaper and quicker			2
