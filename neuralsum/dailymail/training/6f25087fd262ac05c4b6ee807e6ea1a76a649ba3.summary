by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 15 september 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 16 september 2013 @entity2 's family have scrutinised the @entity3 for their creation of a @entity6 programme that undermines the claims of her husband , @entity8 the family of murdered honeymooner @entity2 have accused the @entity3 of playing ‘ judge and jury ’ in a documentary that casts doubt on the prosecution case against her husband			1
the 28 - year - old was kidnapped and shot dead in the back of a taxi while on honeymoon in @entity21 with millionaire @entity8 , in november 2010			1
@entity8 , 33 , is accused of paying two local men to kill his wife in a sham car - jacking			1
but a @entity6 programme , @entity26 : who killed @entity2 ? , claims to expose holes in the evidence of star prosecution witness @entity30			1
the @entity3 says it has obtained ‘ secret police files ’ that will ‘ expose fundamental mistakes both in the police investigation and the interpretation of forensic evidence ’			1
mrs @entity2 ’s uncle , @entity38 , said the corporation did not consult the family about the ‘ insensitive ’ documentary and claims broadcasters had added to their grief			1
he said producers failed to seek a right to reply from the family and even reused previous interviews with relatives			2
mr @entity38 has written to @entity3 director - general lord hall to claim the broadcaster had broken its guidelines to ‘ minimise possible distress ’ to grieving families			1
he said : ‘ broadcasters should not be doing a programme before the trial about whether someone is guilty or not guilty			2
‘ we have a court and a justice system in the world , which should be respected			2
‘ it is not their place to play judge and jury			1
this battle should be played out in the courts , not in the media			2
’ mr @entity38 said the programme was a shameless attempt to ‘ play on @entity2 ’s name for publicity and to get viewers ’			1
he asked how the @entity3 had obtained a confidential @entity21 police file , containing cctv tapes and mobile phone records , and questioned the motives of whoever leaked the documents			1
he said : ‘ i asked them where they got the information , and they said it was n’t stolen from the police and they did n’t pay for it			2
@entity92 footage taken from the couple 's honeymoon hotel in @entity21 shows the final hours of @entity2 who was murdered in 2010 ‘ so how did these police files get into their hands and whose interest did it serve ? they paid forensic experts to appear on the programme , but they do n’t have access to the full case files			1
and who is going to cross-examine the experts ? ’ last night it emerged that the programme had also obtained medical records that apparently suggested the couple were trying for a family			1
the evidence could contradict police claims that @entity8 was secretly gay and ordered his wife ’s murder so he could live a homosexual lifestyle			1
the programme claims : ‘ we can reveal medical records – from just days before the honeymoon – show the couple were actively trying for a baby ’ , but does not elaborate on what the records showed			1
mr @entity38 said : ‘ i do n’t think these claims are correct but it is not for the @entity3 to broadcast material like police files and medical records			1
' it is for the courts to examine			0
’ referring to the impending documentary , he said : ‘ this has been stressful for all of our family			1
my brother [ @entity2 ’s father ] is very sad			1
’ the @entity6 programme also says that mrs @entity2 could have been shot ‘ by accident ’			1
firearms experts say the bullet may have rebounded off her hand and through her chest by accident ‘ during a struggle ’			0
the programme also casts doubt on the claims of taxi driver @entity30 , 32 , who received a reduced sentence of 18 years in return for his testimony			2
prosecution witness @entity30 claimed that @entity8 called him on the morning of the murder , but mobile phone records show that no such call took place			0
@entity92 footage from the same night shows @entity8 making what looks like a gunslinger gesture to his wife @entity2 , hours before she was shot dead @entity8 is shown on @entity92 shortly after being told his wife has been found dead			1
he is seen again later on the phone and appears to be smiling a spokesman for @entity6 said : ‘ we understand that the programme maybe difficult viewing for @entity2 ’s family and have approached it sensitively , including contacting her uncle , as the representative of the family , in advance , to let him know that it would air			1
‘ we received replies from mr @entity38 which did not raise these objections			0
the police evidence we have obtained is neither manufactured nor stolen , nor did we pay for it			2
should the @entity38 family wish to issue a statement then we would reflect their position in the programme			2
’ @entity8 is fighting extradition to @entity21 to stand trial for the murder of his @entity189 - born wife			1
at a @entity192 court hearing in july , magistrates rejected his attempt to stay in the @entity194 for further mental health treatment , but he will challenge the decision in the @entity197			0
the documentary airs on @entity199 on thursday at 9pm			2
@entity2 sent text messages to her family before her wedding fearing she would never be happy once married to @entity8 bride - to - be @entity2 sent desperate text messages to her family before her wedding , saying : ‘ i ’m going to be unhappy for the rest of my life ’			1
mrs @entity2 sent a series of increasingly distressed messages to her cousin @entity210 , expressing deep reservations about her fiancé @entity212			2
in august 2010 , two months after she got engaged , she spoke of her loneliness while visiting his family , writing : ‘ miss you so much			2
do n’t want to be with these people			0
want to cry myself to death			0
