by @entity0 last updated at 9:51 am on 18th october 2011 mps were last night labelled ‘ skivers ’ as they announced plans to take an extra five - day holiday in november			1
the deal was offered after politicians complained about being recalled twice over the summer recess to discuss phone hacking and riots			0
in an attempt to placate them , @entity11 sir @entity10 has proposed they enjoy a five - day ‘ mini-break ’ next month			0
question time off : @entity1 have voted to give themselves an extra five - day mini-break in november to compensate for the days lost during the recall of @entity18 for the @entity19 not shirking : prime minister @entity20 , pictured today , said this parliament will sit more in its first two years than was the case under the last parliament but the idea has enraged union leaders , who have accused mps of going ‘ on the skive ’ at a time when families are working hard just to make ends meet			1
the row comes after @entity20 promised to cut @entity1 ’ holidays to show he understands public concern about their conduct			2
while most workers in the public and private sectors get four or five weeks off annually , this deal – thrashed out in behind - the - scenes talks with all parties – will bring the number of @entity44 recess days this year to 87 , excluding weekends			1
the holiday , which begins on november 15 , would replace the break usually given around that time ahead of the @entity48 , which has been postponed by the coalition until the spring			0
but the mini-break begins just six weeks after mps have returned from their three - week conference break – and is followed by a three - week @entity54 holiday only a month later			2
@entity55 , general secretary of the @entity56 , said : ‘ while working people are struggling round the clock to make ends meet , the same politicians who unleashed the austerity programme have been caught out on the skive			1
recalled : @entity1 were brought back to @entity18 during the recess because of the @entity65 riots it looks bad : @entity68 mp @entity67 , left , has criticised the decision saying it risks making his colleague look like ' part - timers ' while union boss @entity55 , right , said it shows mps are ' on the skive ' change of plan : the mini-break replaces the holiday traditionally held around the same time , ahead of the @entity48 , which has been postponed by the coalition until the spring in defence : sir @entity10 says mps often conduct constituency business while on holiday ‘ we will take no more of the “ we are all in this together ” rubbish from this crowd			1
’ a spokesman for sir @entity10 said @entity1 would be sitting for a greater number of days during this @entity18 than the last one and insisted the mini-break was shorter than those given in the past around the @entity48			2
next year ’s summer holiday will also be shorter than those in previous years , with mps returning to @entity95 in september ahead of party conferences			2
the spokesman added : ‘ the government is ensuring that the @entity99 sits more evenly throughout the year , rather than breaking up for an 82 - day summer recess as under the previous government			1
‘ as usual , mps continue to undertake important constituency and select committee work , even when the @entity99 is not sitting for the days in question			0
’ but @entity108 , of the @entity107 , said : ‘ it ’s utterly astounding that some members want a holiday barely six weeks after returning from their last recess			1
‘ this motion makes @entity18 look incredibly out of touch at a time when many ordinary families do n’t have the time or the money to enjoy a vacation themselves			0
’ meanwhile , commons speaker @entity121 revealed that a new security chief could be appointed to protect @entity18 following the foam pie attack on media mogul @entity124 in july			0
he said a review into the incident had found that there was ‘ inadequate ’ security in the committee room at the time			0
@entity130 at @entity131 , the official in charge of security at the @entity95 , last week announced that she intends to retire in january .			0

total holiday days for the year stands at 87 - excluding weekends
one mp says his colleagues risk becoming ' a bunch of part - timers '
@entity107 calls the decision ' utterly astounding '
union leader @entity55 leader says politicians are ' on the skive '
@entity20 *'s* spokesman says this parliament ' will sit more in its first two years than under the last government '
