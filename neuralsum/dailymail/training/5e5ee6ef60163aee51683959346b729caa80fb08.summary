talk about salt being rubbed into the wound			0
to all those head - in - the - hands @entity6 fans wondering where their defence has gone , these words from @entity4 sporting director @entity3 will cut deep			1
' we always look for players that can improve @entity4 's quality regardless of their provenance			2
@entity14 is an example of this			0
he was a great signing because he arrived here intact and for free			0
he 's got a great mentality and he will show what it means to be a winner			2
he has been a linchpin to a historical club like @entity6			2
' there are no linchpins at @entity26 any more - instead @entity27 has a cast list of injury - prone , untried , out - of - position players for the defensive roles			2
indeed , @entity31 called the @entity6 defence that finished the match against @entity34 ' the worst back four you 'll ever see '			1
@entity14 was deemed past his sell - by date at @entity26 but is now playing in @entity37 for @entity4 @entity27 's back - line has an unfamiliar look thanks to plenty of injuries and no back - up defenders here is how @entity6 finished their 1 - 0 derby defeat against @entity34 at the back ... @entity46 ( winger ) @entity48 ( midfielder ) @entity50 ( a kid ) @entity51 ( a prospect but a rookie ) thirty - something @entity14 is doing it in @entity37 even if he was deemed past his sell - by date at @entity6			1
all that dosh splashed on exciting , attacking players and only one ' senior ' summer buy on a defender - £ 16million @entity60 @entity59			1
and now he is crocked with a dislocated shoulder			1
@entity64 is trying to build a dynasty and , so far , the foundations are being laid on shifting sands			0
short - term , the @entity67 has a defensive crisis of epic proportions – january must feel light years away			0
sadly for him , he can not take a jemmy to the transfer window now			0
instead the @entity6 boss must plan for the next match against @entity76 on the back of a measly return of 13 points from 10 matches and 13 points adrift of leaders @entity83			2
the players who finished as defenders in the 1 - 0 derby defeat by @entity34 on sunday were : @entity46 , winger ; @entity48 , midfielder ; @entity50 , kid ; @entity51 , big - money , exciting prospect but still a rookie			1
@entity6 's spending included a summer buy on defender @entity59 who is now out with a dislocated shoulder @entity92 spent plenty on attacking players and only one ' senior ' summer buy on a defender - £ 16million @entity95 @entity59 is carried off on a stretcher during the @entity99 derby between @entity34 and @entity6 on sunday the @entity101 table @entity102 , red - carded against @entity34 , is suspended for the @entity76 game			1
@entity104 ( shin splints ) , @entity106 ( ankle ) , and @entity108 ( training ground mystery injury ) are also out			0
@entity64 must decide whether to go for experience , even if that means asking players like @entity48 and @entity46 to do unfamiliar jobs , or whether to look from the kindergarten ranks			1
add together the @entity101 games for @entity6 of @entity51 , @entity50 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 and they have notched 15 between them			1
@entity116 has already played six @entity101 matches this season , which puts him one ahead of @entity51 and three ahead of @entity50			1
the next name on the waiting list is central defender @entity117 , who came on as a substitute against @entity126 and who is regarded as a star of the future			2
@entity117 captains the under 21s and was part of the successful 2011 @entity133 - winning side			0
players who have since emerged from that team include @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
after that , it really is uncharted waters for @entity64			0
@entity142 , 22 , and left back @entity120 , 20 , both figured in the 4 - 0 @entity145 drubbing by @entity146 and have yet to make league debuts for @entity6			2
@entity50 ( left ) and @entity51 ( right ) were part of @entity6 's makeshift defence against @entity34 on sunday winger @entity46 ( right ) started the @entity99 derby at right back for @entity6 @entity151 ( second from right ) was temporarily centre half after injuries and @entity102 's sending off @entity6 midfielder @entity48 was forced to come on in defence against @entity34 on sunday click here for the full report @entity120 caught the eye on the pre-season tour of @entity161 , especially the performances against @entity163 and @entity164			1
he has had a second chance at @entity26 after being released by @entity166			0
reach even further down and there is 17 - year - old @entity119 , who was recruited from @entity168 last year and is regarded as one for the future			0
he was bought as a right back but often plays midfield			0
so it is headache time for @entity64			0
@entity46 over @entity175 ? @entity48 and @entity50 or @entity117 or both kids at the expense of @entity48 ? at least @entity51 is a shoo - in			1
meanwhile , roll on january ... @entity117 ( left ) captains @entity6 's under 21 side , while @entity116 has made some first - team progress @entity180 defensive crisis for @entity64			1

@entity46 ( winger ) , @entity48 ( midfielder ) , @entity50 ( a kid ) and @entity51 ( a prospect ) ended as @entity6 's *latest* back four
@entity31 called @entity6 defence that ended defeat by @entity34 ' the worst back four you 'll ever see '
@entity6 spent plenty on attacking players and only one ' senior ' defender
@entity59 cost £ 16million but is now out with a dislocated shoulder
