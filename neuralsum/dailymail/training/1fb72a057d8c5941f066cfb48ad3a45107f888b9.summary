these are the latest pictures of @entity1 , just one of dozens of @entity2 and other foreign fighters who have traveled to @entity5 to fight alongside @entity7 militias against the @entity8			1
the 28 - year - old food packaging worker from @entity10 , @entity11 , is a former @entity13 soldier who never served overseas			1
but he has been fighting with the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) since last september			1
after starting his adventure in @entity5 , the committed @entity17 is now in @entity19 , where he fights against the jihadis of @entity8 wearing a tactical vest scribbled with the words ' @entity23 is lord '			2
' i decided that if my government was n't going to do anything to help this country , especially @entity7 people who stood by us for 10 years and helped us out while we were in this country , then i was going to do something			2
' mr @entity1 and dozens of other @entity32 now fight with the @entity33 , spurred on by @entity7 social media campaigners and a sense of duty many feel after @entity19 , the target of a decade - long @entity2 - led military campaign , collapsed under an islamic state group offensive within days last summer			1
and while @entity2 and its coalition allies bomb the extremists from the air , @entity33 say they hope more westerners will join them on the ground to fight			1
not all fun and games : this picture from the @entity46 page shows @entity72 , who 's said to be a @entity74 fighter , lying in a clinic after he was injured during violent clashes against @entity61 terrorists in @entity31 more @entity2 volunteers : these two men are pictured on the @entity46 page and identified as @entity80 , left , and @entity81 , right , two more volunteers from the @entity2 who have come to fight with the @entity16 ' i 'm not going back until the fight is finished ' : an earlier picture of mr @entity1 taken from @entity46 foreigners joining other people 's wars is nothing new , from the @entity90 to the @entity91 of the @entity92			1
the @entity33 , however , turned to the @entity93 to find its warriors , creating a @entity46 page called @entity97 with the stated mission of sending ' terrorists to hell and save humanity			1
' the page also frequently features portraits of smiling , beautiful and heavily armed @entity7 female commanders and fighters			2
mr @entity1 and three other @entity2 and an @entity41 national who spoke to the @entity42 all said they arranged joining @entity7 forces through the @entity46 page , run by the @entity15 , or @entity16 , the main @entity5 @entity7 militia fighting in northern @entity5 and @entity19			1
they crossed from @entity111 into @entity5 , now in its fourth year of civil war , before later joining a @entity7 offensive sweeping into @entity19 to challenge the @entity8 group			2
they now are based in @entity31 , where stone homes painted green , pink and yellow have been damaged in fighting , surrounded by sandbags and piles of rubble			2
foreigners like mr @entity1 seem drawn to helping @entity33 , yazidis and other minority ethnic groups caught up in the battle and facing possible destruction at the hand of extremists willing to massacre hundreds in propaganda videos			1
' how many people were sold into slavery or killed just for being part of a different ethnic group or religion ? ' he said			0
' that 's something i am willing to die to defend			0
' however , the other @entity32 who talked to the @entity42 spoke on condition of anonymity , fearing the reaction of their families , who did n't know where they were , or possible legal troubles if they make it back home			0
they know how to party : fighters from the @entity16 and @entity149 militias dance in celebration after defeating @entity8 fighters in @entity152 , the town in northern @entity5 which has been a battleground for months so far , the @entity2 has n't banned @entity2 from fighting with militias against the @entity8 group , though it considers the @entity111 - based @entity7 @entity157 , commonly known as the @entity158 , a terrorist organization			2
the @entity158 has been fighting alongside the ypg in @entity31 and in the @entity5 town of @entity152			1
under @entity41 law , it is illegal to fight with any force outside of its national army			0
@entity41 also is one of the first countries to criminalise travel to @entity5 's @entity169 province , the de facto capital of the @entity8 group			0
the @entity2 @entity171 in @entity172 had no immediate comment to an @entity42 query about @entity2 fighting with the @entity33			1
devastated : @entity7 fighters walk in a street reduced to rubble during the five - month battle for @entity152 shattered : almost all parts of the town are in ruins following the fierce fighting that has taken place there mr @entity1 and other foreigners fighting with the @entity16 last month travelled from @entity5 into @entity31 , the area which saw thousands of @entity124 flee into the surrounding mountains last year during the @entity8 group 's offensive			1
it 's unclear how many foreigners total are fighting with the @entity16 and other @entity7 forces , though both foreigners and @entity33 say there are ' dozens			1
' there 's a clear comradery among foreign fighters in @entity31 , most traveling in pairs around the town			0
a number of @entity16 fighters , many of them as young as 17 , joke and tease their new foreign friends , speaking to them in the local @entity7 dialect			0
one fighter , 21 - year - old @entity206 from @entity5 , spends much of his time with the foreigners since he can speak @entity209			2
' we learn from them and they learn from us , ' said @entity213 , who @entity2 and @entity41 fighters have nicknamed ' @entity216 '			0
' they speak with us and they like to joke			0
they share with us many things			0
' the human cost of victory : a visitor walks at a cemetery for @entity7 ypg and @entity149 fighters killed during the battle for @entity152 , at the border town of @entity228 , in @entity111 's southeastern @entity230 province @entity232 fighters in @entity31 say there is a major drive to recruit as many foreigners as possible , especially those with military training as many of young @entity7 fighters have little or no experience			1
the young fighters often pick up weapons and ammunition from dead islamic state group militants			0
they also have no body armor			0
fighting remains dangerous for the @entity32 as well			2
two of the foreign fighters said they had just returned from visiting an @entity2 fighter badly wounded in battle			0
they said another foreign fighter , a @entity74 national , was severely wounded in battle in @entity5 last week			0
' you need to know what you 're getting in to , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' a lot of times you 're going out , you 're in a mud hut			0
... you have bullets and a blanket , and sometimes you just have bread , but you need to hold the line			0

@entity1 , 28 , has been fighting with the ypg since september
he is one of ' dozens ' of foreigners who have traveled to join the @entity33
they have been recruited through @entity46 and many are *veterans*
