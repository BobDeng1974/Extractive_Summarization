president @entity0 wants publicly funded community college available to all @entity2 , a sweeping proposal that would make higher education as accessible as a high school diploma to boost weak @entity2 wages and skills for the modern workforce			1
the initiative 's price tag has yet to be revealed , and it faces a @entity13 @entity12 averse to big new spending programs			2
but it will likely be a centerpiece of @entity0 's @entity17 in a week and a half			1
but the @entity19 tweeted on thursday that ' president @entity0 's plan could save a full - time student an average of $ 3,800/year in tuition			1
' if all 50 states were to participate – they would have to pick up the tab for one - quarter of the tuition cost – the idea could benefit up to 9 million students , the @entity19 officials said in a fact sheet friday morning			1
those figures could be costly , adding up to $ 34 billion per year , provided @entity12 green - lights the proposal			1
' put simply , what i 'd like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who is willing to work for it , ' @entity0 said in the video , which attracted 5.7 million viewers in less than 18 hours			0
he spoke seated on the front of his desk from his office aboard @entity60 , in the midst of a three - day tour to preview the agenda he 'll be outlining in his jan. 20 in the @entity17 address			1
' it 's something that we can accomplish , and it 's something that will train our work force so that we can compete with anybody in the world , ' @entity0 said			0
administration officials on a conference call with reporters thursday evening said the funding details would come out later with the president 's budget next month			1
students would qualify if they attend at least half - time , maintain a 2.5 gpa and make progress toward completing a degree or certificate program			1
participating schools would have to meet certain academic requirements			0
the idea got a chilly response from @entity19 speaker @entity87 's office			1
' with no details or information on the cost , this seems more like a talking point than a plan , ' said spokesman @entity94			0
in his @entity95 , @entity0 proposed universal preschool , which @entity12 did not take up because of cost			2
@entity0 policy adviser @entity98 pointed out that even without federal action , many states are taking up the idea and expanding preschool			0
and she pointed out that a @entity13 – @entity47 gov. @entity102 – last year signed into law a pioneering scholarship program that provides free community and technical college tuition for two years			0
it has drawn 58,000 applicants , almost 90 percent of the state 's high school seniors			0
@entity98 said @entity0 's proposal was inspired by the popular @entity47 plan and a similar program in @entity114			2
@entity47 @entity115 rep. @entity115 said her state 's plan , called @entity118 , is paid mostly with lottery funds , while the federal funding source for @entity0 's plan is unclear and states will have to pay something			2
' ultimately , any efforts to reboot @entity118 as a one - size - fits - all nationwide approach will be met with heavy skepticism from @entity12 , ' @entity115 said			2
president @entity0 spoke at @entity127 , on thursday in @entity128 about the recovering housing sector ; he will address his community college plan friday in @entity47 @entity47 @entity131 sen. @entity131 , a former education secretary who is set to take over the @entity133 committee that oversees education , did not immediately respond to a request for comment			1
