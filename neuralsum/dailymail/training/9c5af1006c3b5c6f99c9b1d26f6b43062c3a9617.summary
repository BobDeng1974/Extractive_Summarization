an @entity1 court has condemned the leader of the @entity3 and 682 of his supporters to death , a year after the @entity7 group was ousted from power in a military coup			1
@entity10 , the @entity3 's general guide , and his fellow defendants faced charges over an attack on a police station in @entity16 in 2013 in which a policeman was killed			1
if confirmed by @entity1 's @entity19 , it would make him the most senior @entity3 figure sentenced to death since one of the group 's leading ideologues , @entity22 , was sentenced and executed in 1966			1
the decision sparked hysteria outside the court as several women fainted upon hearing news of the verdicts , while others wailed : ' why ? this is unfair ! ' but after sentencing @entity10 and his followers , the judge then overturned the death penalties of another 492 @entity3 members , jailing them for life instead			1
his opinion , however , is not legally binding and can be ignored by the court they were among 529 men sentenced to death in march in one of a series of mass trials that have been widely condemned by human rights campaigners in and out of the country			1
the other 37 convicts from those proceedings were told they would remain on death row			2
in announcing the 683 death sentences for violence and the killing of policemen , judge @entity72 also said he was referring his ruling to the @entity19 , the nation 's top @entity74 official - a requirement under @entity1 law , but one that is considered a formality			2
it does , however , give a window of opportunity for a judge to reverse an initial sentence			2
both monday 's and the march trial are linked to deadly riots that erupted in @entity16 and elsewhere in @entity1 after security forces violently disbanded sit - ins held by @entity3 supporters in @entity89 last august			1
three policemen and a civilian were killed in those riots			0
hundreds were killed as part of a sweeping campaign against supporters of former president @entity96 , ousted by the military last july			1
the removal of @entity96 - a year after he was elected - came after millions demonstrated against his rule , demanding he step down for abuse of power			1
@entity1 's interim , military - backed government has branded the @entity3 a terrorist group , a claim it denies			1
some 16,000 people have been arrested since the military ousted @entity96 last july , including most of the group 's top leaders			1
large numbers of @entity112 protesters have also been rounded up and detained by police			0
fear : the biggest trials in @entity1 's modern history have reinforced fears among human rights groups that the military - backed government and anti-islamist judges are bent on crushing dissent anger : there were hundreds of supporters of the defendants outside court who reacted angrily at news of their family - members ' fate after monday 's ruling , which followed a single session in the case held last month , @entity130 , the executive director of @entity132 's @entity131 and @entity133 , said the defendants were not given the chance to properly defend themselves			1
the proceedings went on without the judge even verifying that the defendants were present , she said			0
' the fact that the death sentences can be appealed provides little solace to hundreds of families that will go to sleep tonight facing the very real prospect that their loves ones could be executed without having an opportunity to present a case in court , ' she said			2
' there is no more serious violation of the most basic right of due process and the right to a fair trial than that			0
' according to a judicial official who oversaw the investigation in the case , evidence presented in the trial consisted mostly of footage of the defendants showing them attacking and looting a police station in @entity89 and setting fire to several government buildings			0
the defendants faced nearly 14 charges , five of them punishable by death , said the official			2
' this is a public opinion case , there must be a swift , deterrent punishment , ' said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media			0
' yes , the verdict is very harsh , the number of people on trial is shocking , but it 's proportional to the crimes			0
' @entity10 was not at the hearing in @entity16 but in another court , in @entity89 , where he faces charges of murder and incitement to murder along with 16 other @entity3 leaders in a case connected to deadly protests outside the group 's headquarters last june			1
pain : a woman weeps after learning that her relative will be put to death on guard : @entity1 policemen stand guard outside the court			1
once the @entity19 reviews monday 's ruling , the same court will hold another session on june 21 to issue the final verdicts wives , sisters , mothers and children of the 683 men sentenced to death cried , shouted and collapsed into each other 's arms once the @entity19 reviews monday 's ruling , the same court will hold another session on june 21 to issue the final verdicts			2
as the ruling was announced , an outcry erupted outside the court among the families and relatives of the defendants			0
' my three sons are inside , ' said a woman who only gave her first name , @entity229 , as she screamed in grief			0
' i have no one but @entity232			0
' sitting on the pavement in front of the police cordon , 58 - year - old @entity236 , who also would not give her second name fearing for her relative on trial , broke into tears and screamed : ' this judge is a butcher			0
' the father of another defendant , @entity244 , said his son @entity245 was arrested in january , six months after the alleged violence he was charged with			0
' there is no evidence whatsoever , ' he said			0
' if my son is guilty , behead him but if he is innocent , there will be a civil war			0
' another woman who also only gave her first name , @entity255 , 48 , could not believe her brother and son were sentenced to death			2
' i swear , they do n't even pray , they do n't go to mosques , ' she said			0
' they are not @entity3			1

hundreds have been killed and thousands arrested lawyer @entity285 , said monday 's hearing lasted only eight minutes			0
security forces surrounded the court building and blocked roads , preventing families and media from attending the proceedings			0
' this is against the spirit of the law , ' @entity285 said			0
but in the capital , @entity89 , where many are strongly anti-brotherhood , several residents said they approved of the death sentences			2
' even if they sentence a million people to death , so what ? ' said @entity302 , a 43 - year - old newspaper seller in the eastern district of @entity304			2
' this is the best ruling in the history of the @entity1 judiciary			0
' today 's decisions are certain to raise tension in @entity1 , which has been gripped by turmoil since the army removed the @entity3 from power last year			1
