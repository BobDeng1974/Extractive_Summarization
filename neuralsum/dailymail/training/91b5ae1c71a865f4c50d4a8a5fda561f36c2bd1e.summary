by @entity0 @entity1 is reportedly set to axe 900 jobs within days after its flagging letters business potentially faces billions of dollars in losses			1
one of @entity6 's oldest companies , founded in 1809 , is forecast to go heavily into the red if it continues to offer its failing letter delivery service , @entity10 reports			1
its 32,000 staff are expected to be informed of the cuts as early as tuesday , with most positions to go in @entity15 and @entity16			1
' @entity1 has made it very clear that it is confronting dramatic change due to the impact of declining revenues in our letters service , ' an @entity1 spokeswoman told @entity36			1
' our managing director and ceo @entity19 has publicly stated that the losses in letters business have already overwhelmed the profits in parcels and without reform , the letters services will lose over $ 1 billion annually in a few years			1
' huge cuts : the most positions are expected to go in @entity15 and the @entity16 head office of @entity1 ( pictured ) posties could lose their jobs : private modelling indicates @entity1 will lose $ 7.1 billion through to 2022 - 23 if the business continues on its present the spokeswoman added : ' @entity1 is already responding and is a much leaner organisation than it was three years ago			1
' part of the modernisation of @entity1 involves shifting resources and investing in areas in response to customer needs , such as recent announcements around the extension of @entity64 services and parcel delivery to saturdays and extended weekend trading hours			2
' ' we will not be commenting further until the impact of these and other changes we need to make are communicated to our staff , who of course remain our top priority , ' she said			0
@entity21 papers says private modelling indicates @entity1 will lose $ 7.1 billion through to 2022 - 23 if the business continues on its present path			1
@entity19 was appointed @entity78 and ceo of @entity1 in february 2010			2
in may of that year , he announced a new strategy that was designed to bring the company into the future			0
it included a new organisation structure and a foray into digital businesses			0
however , last year things began to look worse for the company as it was announced external recruitment had been frozen			0
mr @entity19 has been fairly open with the government about the impending financial problems for the postal service , which reaches more than 10 million @entity6 addresses , operates 6,990 postal outlets , and serves more than a million customers in postal outlets every business day			2
the company 's three core areas are letters and associated services , retail merchandise and agency services , and parcels and logistics			2
falling behind : @entity1 's letters service lost $ 218 million in 2013 in @entity1 's annual report last year , released in october , mr @entity19 announced a steady 14 per cent rise in revenue to $ 5.8 billion			1
but the actual letters part of the business lost $ 218 million in 2013			1
while there may not be much money left in delivering letters these days , other parts of the postal service are booming			0
its unregulated packages business made $ 648 million			0
this was in part because the company has an advantage in the package business world over competitors like @entity125 - it can use the entire @entity1 network , including some 4400 retail outlets - with 2651 situated in rural areas - and the huge network of posties			0
communications minister @entity131 said earlier this year that there were no plans to sell @entity1			0
the news that the service could axe 900 jobs in the next few days , is in bitter contrast to mr @entity19 's current pay packet			2
despite working for a public utility , he was paid a whopping $ 4.8 million in 2013			1
his earnings were higher than the bosses of some of @entity6 's biggest companies , including @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
he received a pay increase of 66 per cent , while his workers received a meager 1.5 per cent pay rise in 2013			0

company is forecast to go heavily into the red by 2022 - 23
staff are expected to be informed of the cuts as early as tuesday
most jobs likely to go in @entity15 and @entity16
home delivery of standard - priced mail is expected to be another casualty
