@entity0 could be linked with @entity1 by road as part of an ambitious project to create the world 's longest superhighway spanning half the circumference of the globe			1
proposals have been put forward to build the mega route stretching about 12,400 miles from the western edge of @entity12 to the @entity13 where the country nudges @entity15			1
linking into existing road networks in @entity18 and @entity19 , for the first time it would allow travellers a proper highway to drive all way from the @entity0 to the @entity24			1
a trans - siberian rail link as well as oil and gas pipes would run alongside the highway , and plans have been mooted already for a rail tunnel connecting the far flung @entity12 region of @entity31 - where football tycoon @entity32 once served as governor - and @entity15			1
by jumping on the @entity35 you could get all the way from @entity37 to @entity15 by road under plans for a more than 12,000 mile superhighway linking @entity18 and western @entity12 to the @entity13 while roads exist across much of @entity12 some are of dismal quality , especially in the east of the country			1
among these is the notorious @entity47 built by @entity49 's political prisoners			0
this new scheme is seen as a way of turning @entity12 into a global transportation hub , a bridge between @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity1 , so revitalising the @entity12 economy and attracting new tourism			1
@entity56 , the @entity57 , recently put forward the uncosted plan dubbed the @entity59 ( @entity60 ) to president @entity61			1
' the project is very ambitious and expensive , but it will solve many problems in the development of the vast region , ' he said , according to @entity66			0
the current longest continuous road in the world is found in @entity69 , where @entity71 runs around the entire country and spans some 9,000 miles			1
in @entity12 the @entity74 network is more than 6,800 miles long , meaning the new road would become the biggest and longest ever built , with additional sections in the west and east			2
plans for the @entity59 have been presented to president @entity61 ( left ) by @entity56 , the @entity57 ( right )			1
it is as yet uncosted the notorious road of @entity81 , named because the skeletons of those who died during its construction were used in its foundations plans for the @entity60 were unveiled by the head of the @entity91 @entity90 - who has been hit by @entity94 sanctions over @entity95 - at a meeting of the @entity97			2
using tunnels or ferries from @entity101 the continent , and @entity12 to the @entity24 , a driver could use the highway to travel from @entity0 to the @entity24 for the first time			1
its development is viewed as a ' powerful and versatile ' corridor that would allow massive investment and the construction of pipelines for oil and gas , the laying of facilities for electricity and water supplies and the opportunity for new cities to be created			0
while roads exist across much of @entity12 some are of dismal quality , especially in the east			2
among these is the @entity47 , built by the political prisoners of @entity49 ( pictured ) the team behind the project say they estimate it will require trillions of dollars but insist its economic benefits would far outweigh any cost			0
what is unclear is how a cash - strapped @entity12 could afford it			2
giving a presentation on the scheme , @entity136 - a close friend of @entity61 - described it as ' an inter-state , inter-civilisation project '			0
he also said it would lead to @entity12 becoming the new world centre for the creation and development of high - tech industries because of its central position in the new global transport network			2
five years ago @entity61 travelled along some of the existing roads in the @entity148 as part of a tour to meet voters before the presidential elections			0
behind the wheel of a yellow @entity154 , he drove 2,000 kilometres across @entity155 in a stunt intended to boost his ratings and the @entity12 car industry			0
but it backfired when he discovered much of the route was in a bad state of repair and his car was photographed on the back of a tow truck			0
the @entity81 - better known as the @entity47 after the skeletons of those who died in its construction were used in its foundations - is the only main road through the remotest parts of the @entity148			0
connecting @entity174 with the town of @entity176 , much of the route is unmaintained and about 200km is completely abandoned and a challenge even for motorists in 4x4 vehicles			0
the rail network in @entity155 was recently extended with the construction of a new line to a station across the @entity185 from @entity12 's diamond capital of @entity187			2
potentially this line could be extended further east to @entity174 and the @entity188 .			0

@entity59 would span half globe 's circumference
would link western edge of @entity12 to the @entity13 and then @entity15
joining road networks in @entity18 and @entity19 , would link @entity0 to @entity24
@entity97 put forward plan to president @entity61
current longest road in the world is @entity69 highway 1 at 9,000 miles
