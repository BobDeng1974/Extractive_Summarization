@entity0 has vowed @entity1 will confront @entity2 with ' all guns blazing ' at @entity4 on saturday as they seek to atone for a losing start to the @entity6			1
the ambition of issuing a statement of intent against @entity10 ahead of next year 's @entity11 was dashed by a 24 - 21 defeat that saw @entity14 's men picked apart in a one - sided second half			1
@entity1 have not toppled the @entity2 in 11 meetings dating back to 2006 and a loss this weekend would represent their worst sequence of results for eight years			1
@entity0 the forwards on scrummaging technique during their training session at @entity23 ' we 've got to beat these big southern hemisphere teams at @entity4			2
@entity2 are the next to come to our stadium			2
we 've got to beat them , we know that , and we 'll go in all guns blazing to do that , ' @entity0 said			0
' we ca n't hide from the fact that we lost the last four games , albeit against the world champion			2
there 's been no hiding place since the @entity10 game - we had some very frank discussions			1
' @entity1 's @entity39 - born attacking skills coach @entity38 described the @entity2 as the ' big green machine ' and it is a view shared by @entity0 , who faced them three times as a player			1
@entity45 speaks to @entity0 at @entity4 during @entity1 training ' they 're a very abrasive outfit			1
they 'll always be up there as one of the best packs			0
physically and genetically they 're big men			0
they play a very powerful brand of rugby , ' @entity0 said			0
' their pack will always be there or thereabouts			0
they 're certainly one of the heaviest			0
you know when you 've played them because the players will be sore for a few days after the game			0
' they 're technically very well drilled and have a lot of experience			0
they like to use line - outs for drives and their scrum is a big focal point of their physicality			2
' you 'll see how they bind on to each other before they receive the ball , then they like to run through as a band of players			0
they like to impose themselves on the opposition as early as they can			0
' @entity14 and @entity0 talk tactics ahead of @entity1 's crucial clash with @entity2 head coach @entity87 is trying to make @entity2 a more expansive team and the tourists have had their own wounds to lick after following up an impressive victory over @entity10 with last weekend 's 29 - 15 defeat by @entity93 in @entity94			1
@entity0 , however , expects @entity1 to face the traditional route one approach in the second of their four tests this autumn			1
' potentially they could play in a different way to what we 'd expect , but in patches against @entity93 they reverted to type			0
they scored a try from a driving maul and their scrum was very strong , ' @entity0 said			0
' they have a good variety in the squad to back up any style of play , but i 'm expecting a power game against us			2
' @entity1 have been honest in appraising their shortcomings against @entity10 , highlighting their poor game management for their inability to triumph having led 14 - 11 at half - time			1
in a show of faith @entity120 has retained the players who under performed against the @entity10 , making just one injury - enforced change to the starting xv with @entity126 given his full debut on the right wing as a replacement for @entity130 , who has a thigh complaint			1
it will be a new - look side that takes to the field against @entity134 next saturday , before @entity14 reverts to his strongest line - up for the concluding international against @entity136			1
' it will be a huge challenge against @entity2 , but we need this challenge after last week , ' @entity0 said .			2

@entity1 face @entity2 in their next @entity6 match at @entity4
@entity14 's side lost 24 - 21 to @entity10 in their last outing
they have not toppled the @entity2 in 11 meetings dating back to 2006
