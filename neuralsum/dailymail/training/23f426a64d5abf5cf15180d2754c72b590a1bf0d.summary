by @entity0 a toddler is battling a rare condition that keeps erasing her personality and all the skills she has learnt			1
@entity5 , who is 22 months , has been diagnosed with @entity7 syndrome , a rare and serious form of epilepsy in infants			1
at her worst , she was having up to 200 seizures a day and was given just 11 months to live			1
@entity5 ( pictured with her mother , @entity12 ) has @entity7 syndrome which is a form of epilepsy			1
every time she has a seizure she forgets all of the skills she has learnt and her personality changes every time she has a relapse , she loses all of the skills she has learnt , including the ability to smile and giggle			1
she even likes different foods and toys			0
her mother , @entity12 , 36 , and father , @entity26 , 35 , even say that it is like having a newborn baby all over again			0
‘ after each episode , it feels like we have lost a daughter and gained a new one , ’ said mrs @entity5			1
‘ we bought her a really cute musical cot mobile with little pink bears , and it always used to calm her and make her smile			0
but then afterwards , she would cry as soon as we switched it on ! ’ but @entity5 ’s parents could not be prouder of her			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ @entity5 has been through a lot , but she keeps on smiling			2
she still ca n’t walk , talk or feed herself , but she keeps on getting better and we are hopeful that things will continue to improve			0
’ @entity5 ( pictured with her father , @entity26 ) has sight and hearing problems as a result of her seizures and has not yet learnt to walk , talk or feed herself when she was diagnosed , @entity5 's parents were told she was unlikely to live for much more than a year but she was then put on a new drug which has dramatically improved her health - she has not relapsed for a year because of her condition , @entity5 requires round - the - clock care and her seizures have also left her with hearing loss and visual impairment			1
she was diagnosed at just three - months - old after her mother noticed she was jerking in her highchair at their home in @entity59 , @entity60			0
after she was rushed by ambulance to the @entity63 department at @entity64 , an @entity66 scan confirmed she had @entity7 syndrome			1
mrs @entity5 and her road worker husband were devastated by the diagnosis , but quickly pulled themselves together for the sake of @entity5 and their other daughter , @entity72			1
@entity5 was diagnosed with @entity7 syndrome when she was three - months - old			1
her mother took her to hospital when she noticed her jerking in her high chair			0
an @entity66 ( pictured ) confirmed the diagnosis @entity5 was put on steroids which caused her to gain two stone in just eight weeks ( pictured )			2
she had to wear clothes made for a five - year - old and her mother was told her condition was the worst the doctor had ever seen mrs @entity5 said : ‘ at first , we cried			1
but we realised that we were parents to two children and had responsibilities , so instead we threw ourselves into researching the condition			0
‘ the doctors were explaining things in medical terms , and i did n’t understand what they were talking about			0
i wanted to know exactly what they were saying to me			0
’ for the next three months , mrs @entity5 stayed by @entity5 ’s side in hospital as she underwent a series of tests			2
her husband would pick @entity72 up from school after work and drive straight to the hospital so the sisters could bond			0
eventually , @entity5 was discharged from the hospital , but her health deteriorated after she suffered side effects of a steroid medication prescribed to prevent her seizures			1
@entity5 's sister @entity72 ( pictured with @entity5 ) , eight , says she is extremely proud of her ' special sister ' in just eight weeks , she gained two stone in weight and was forced to wear clothes for five - year - olds			1
during a hospital appointment , distraught mrs @entity5 was informed by a neurologist that @entity5 ’s @entity66 scan was the worst he had ever seen , and it was unlikely she would live past 14 months			1
he offered only one alternative - a medication called @entity118 that could help to save her life			2
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ i managed to hold it together until i got back to my car , and then i completely fell apart			2
i just did n’t know what to do			0
i thought we ’d lose her			0
‘ but i still had to pick @entity72 up from school , so i took a deep breath , put my makeup on and tried to stay strong			0
’ miraculously , the medication worked and @entity5 has been relapse - free since @entity129 last year			1
@entity5 could have another seizure at any time but , for now , her parents say they are just enjoying getting to know her as she is whilst aware a seizure could take @entity5 from them again , @entity133 and mrs @entity5 are enjoying getting to know their daughter			1
in fact , mrs @entity5 says @entity5 is a positive influence on the whole family , saying that she has taught them to be more ‘ humble ’ and appreciative of their health			2
office manager mrs @entity5 said : ‘ we have a really good life , and we are a very happy family			2
it ’s important for people to know that it is n’t the end of the world if their child is born with this condition , or any other disability			0
‘ @entity72 loves that @entity5 is different from all the other children			2
she is always saying how proud she is of her “ special sister ” , and how no - one else has a sister like @entity5			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' we have a really good life , and we are a very happy family			2
it 's important for people to know that it is n't the end of the world if their child is born with this condition , or any other disability ' ‘ at first i questioned if we would ever be able to cope , but this is our norm now - it does n’t feel strange to us any more			2
‘ @entity5 is such a funny little character , and i would n’t change her for the world			2
’ west syndrome , which affects just one in 4,000 children , is characterised by infantile spasms , which make the sufferer bow forwards or backwards			0
in 90 per cent of cases , the spasms start before the child is one and will usually continue as they get older			0
often @entity7 syndrome is mistaken for colic , as the spasms are initially irregular and the cries the child makes during or after the seizure are very similar			1
each episode typically lasts only one or two seconds , but the effects can be devastating , and many children will develop lifelong learning difficulties			0

dr @entity191 , @entity192 at @entity64 , said : ‘ @entity5 ’s loss of developmental skills is known as regression - in essence she is developing backwards			2
‘ it is absolutely essential that @entity7 syndrome is diagnosed and treated early , as the longer the syndrome is left untreated , the greater the risk that the child will develop severe developmental problems - including learning difficulties			1
‘ west syndrome is one of the most severe forms of epilepsy , and we will continue to monitor @entity5 as the pattern of seizures can change over time			1
‘ but @entity5 is responding to her medication , and is progressing well			0

typically , each episode lasts a few seconds and there is then a pause followed by a further spasm			0
many babies with the condition see their development slow or even reverse until the spasms are brought under control			0
many children with @entity7 syndrome go on to have other kinds of seizures later in childhood and a lot have learning difficulties			1
the prognosis depends on the underlying cause of the condition			0
