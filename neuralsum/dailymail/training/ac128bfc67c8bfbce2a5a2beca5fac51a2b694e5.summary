let me tell you two things you did n’t know about @entity3			1
firstly , i was the person who engineered his meeting with @entity6 at @entity7 three years ago			0
i was working in my office at home when my phone rang			0
it was @entity3 ’s agent			1
he had heard i knew the right people to fix up a meeting for his player and @entity6 , one of the greatest poets , lyricists and singers ever , and he politely asked if i could help out			0
reformed character : @entity3 appears to be at home with @entity22 after some difficulties management material ? @entity25 said he can see @entity3 becoming a boss when he retires two fingers up : this is what @entity3 would look like if he assumed a managerial role in the future @entity3 had been aggressive and abusive towards me on social media but i have standards and i do n’t hold grudges , so i was happy to oblige			1
so i made the necessary call and a few weeks later i smiled as i read in @entity37 about @entity3 ’s meeting with @entity6 at @entity7			1
secondly , he has been doing his coaching badges and a good friend of mine ( a journalist , not an ex-professional footballer ) , was on the same course as @entity3			1
some of the other former players on the same course wanted to ‘ get ’ the journalist			0
this may have meant injuring him on the pitch , or bullying him off it ; or merely playing some footballer - style pranks on him , possibly urinating in his shoes or setting fire to his clothes - the sort of high - brow jinks players get excited about			0
we will never know what might ’ve happened , however , because @entity3 took it upon himself to look after my pal , and they struck up a friendship			1
they 're up ! @entity22 clinched promotion to the @entity63 by beating @entity64 on saturday i wo n’t pretend i know @entity3 personally – we are from similar backgrounds but that ’s probably where the similarities end			1
to be honest i ’m not really interested in what he ’s like off the field , i talk and write about football and that ’s where i want to focus when talking about him			0
getting bogged down in some of the huge problems of his past is n’t a fair way to judge him as a professional footballer now			0
i do think it is time to re-evaluate @entity3 on the pitch though			1
two years ago he let @entity22 down badly when he was sent off for fighting at @entity80			1
but this season he has made up for that			0
his leadership has been brilliant and his tactical discipline has been seriously impressive			0
both of those qualities were evident on saturday at @entity86 as @entity22 beat @entity64 to win promotion back to the @entity63			1
a source close to @entity25 told me on saturday that he has ‘ grown to like @entity3 ’ as the season has gone on			1
in the post-match frenzy at @entity86 , @entity25 declared that @entity3 will make a great manager in the future			2
last year the midfielder was adamant he would n’t play in the @entity94 , but he ’s knuckled down and been one of the leaders for @entity22 this season			1
i was at the game at @entity86 with @entity99 , who worked with @entity3 at @entity80			2
@entity99 told me : ‘ @entity3 is reasonably likeable			2
i do n’t think he ’s been blessed with a great deal of talent and if you ’d told me back then when he was in @entity80 ’s reserves he would have a career in professional football at this level i would have said , “ not a chance in hell			0
” ' he ’s got where he ’s got in the professional game purely through doggedness and hard work and wanting to be out on the training pitch			0
i probably see a little bit of me in him in regards to that			0
’ that ’s high praise from @entity99 , who played in a @entity120 semi final and a @entity94 semi-final			0
at @entity122 is doing what he did at @entity124 : looking at home towards the top of the championship			0
off the field @entity3 is at times smart , at other times ridiculous and that ’s why i ’d rather judge him on his football , although in the past some of the things he has done away from the game have been impossible to ignore			2
fighter : @entity3 has looked at home at the top of the @entity94 throughout this season i suspect his appearance on @entity137 this week will see him try to win applause from the audience with carefully thought out words about @entity141 , criticism of politicians ( always a winner from the non-politicians on the qt panel ) and a blast at the @entity148 when he ’s asked about @entity150 ’s chances at the @entity120			2
throw in a few big words , present the family man image , mention that he ’s doing a degree and maybe a quote from @entity155 and he ’ll become the poster boy for reformed violent criminals , and that ’s not a bad thing			1
he ’s gone from being a thug , to being aggressive on social media , to seeking to expand his mind			2
he ’s heading in a positive direction			0
if he survives @entity167 on tv on thursday night , @entity3 ’s off - the - field reinvention will , in the eyes of the public , probably be complete			2
if he continues to be @entity22 ’s heartbeat in the @entity63 , his reinvention on the field will also be complete .			1

@entity3 was *integral* to @entity22 ' promotion
*ex-newcastle* bad boy has reformed his character
@entity3 is seeking *redemption* in the @entity63 with @entity22 next year
