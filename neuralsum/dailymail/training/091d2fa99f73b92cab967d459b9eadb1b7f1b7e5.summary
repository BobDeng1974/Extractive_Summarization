an @entity1 man left unable to speak or communicate properly following a head injury took doctors by surprise by ‘ waking up ’ and talking to his family normally after being given a common anti-anxiety drug			1
the 43 - year - old man , who doctors have named @entity9 , suffered a traumatic head injury during a car accident two years ago			1
he was left in a coma for 40 days , and then in a vegetative state – where he was awake but showing no signs of awareness – for four weeks			1
a 43 - year - old @entity1 man who was left unable to speak or communicate after a head injury amazed doctors by ' waking up ' when he was given the common anti-anxiety drug midazolam			1
tests revealed the drug had triggered changes in two networks of the brain responsible for responding to tasks and language one year on after the accident , @entity9 ’s condition had deteriorated			1
he could only think and move slowly , and was completely dependent on others for all daily tasks necessary for living			1
throughout the next year , his family noticed even more of a decline			2
he did n’t speak or communicate in any way , and did n’t answer simple requests like ‘ close your eyes ’			0
he would carry out what doctors called ‘ aimless repetitive behaviours ’ like clapping , but would n’t respond to other stimulus from doctors or his family			2
doctors tested a few different drugs , hoping to help him communicate again			2
after nothing seemed to work , they stopped giving medicine			0
he was diagnosed as being in a ‘ minimally conscious state ’ , meaning he was awake , but was unable to communicate and needed constant care			1
one day @entity9 was send for a routine ct scan - a test which uses x-rays and a computer to create detailed images the brain – his doctors decided to give him common anti-anxiety drug midazolam to sedate him			1
what happened next amazed doctors			0
instead of making the man drowsy for the procedure , the drug ‘ woke him up ’ and he started to chat to the anaesthetists and then his parents			1
@entity69 is in the family of drugs called ‘ benzodiazepines ’			0
it works in the brain to cause sleepiness , muscle relaxation , and short - term memory loss , and to reduce anxiety			0
@entity69 can cause severe breathing problems when used for sedation for conditions that do not require urgent medical attentions			0
it can stop the lungs working properly , which could result in brain damage or death if not treated properly			0
he spoke to his aunt on the phone , recognised the road to his home and even congratulated his brother when he was told he had graduated			0
his family asked him about his accident , but he could n’t remember anything and was unaware he ’d been unable to speak until now			0
two hours later the drugs wore off and @entity9 returned to his previous , minimally conscious state			1
a few weeks later doctors gave him the anti-anxiety drug again , and this time monitored his behaviour and also looked at @entity102 recordings of his brain - a scan which picks up brain impulses			1
once again @entity9 started to chat and interact , and could even carry out basic maths , before losing the ability to speak when the drugs wore off			0
doctors said @entity9 was ‘ able to understand verbal commands and to perform any type of response required , either behavioural or verbal , ’ after being given the drug			2
when they studied the @entity102 recordings of his brain impulses , they found the drug had triggered a change in the brainwave activity in two parts of the brain			2
the first was the part of the brain called the task - positive network , which helps us respond to tasks that require our attention			0
the second was the part of the brain responsible for speaking and understanding language			0
writing in the journal @entity133 and @entity134 , where the doctors documented @entity9 ’s case , they said this is the first described in medical literature where a patient has ‘ woken up ’ after being given the drug midazolam			1
@entity69 is from the family of drugs called benzodiazepines			0
doctors said its use in patients with minimal consciousness - who are unable to communicate - should be investigated			2
a midazolam molecule is pictured they said they suspected @entity9 may have catatonia – a symptom of medical conditions like schtitzophrenia and depression - which leaves a seemingly - awake person unresponsive to stimulus			2
this is because patients with catatonia are also responsive to benzodiazepines , the family of drugs which includes midazolam			2
however , they theorized that perhaps some patients in a ‘ minimally conscious state ’ also show symptoms of catatonia , leaving them unable to move			1
either way , they concluded that treatment with midazolam should be explored for such patients			0
they could be given a continuous infusion of the drug midazolam , which is commonly done in intensive care units for people undergoing long - lasting seizures , they said			1
however , it is not clear what @entity9 's long - term 's fate was .			0

a 43 - year - old @entity1 man was left needing daily care after a head injury
could only think and move slowly , and completely dependent on others
during a routine ct scan he was given drug midazolam as a sedative
*miraculously* , he ' woke up ' and started chatting to his family as normal
doctors found the drug had brought him out of his *barely* conscious state
