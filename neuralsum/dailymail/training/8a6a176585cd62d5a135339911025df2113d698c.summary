by @entity0 a brown dwarf star that appears to be the coldest of its kind - as frosty as @entity5 's @entity4 - has been spotted by an @entity7 astronomer			1
the discovery was made using @entity10 's @entity9 ( @entity9 ) and the @entity11			1
images from the space telescopes also pinpointed the object 's distance at 7.2 light years away , making it the fourth closest system to our sun. a star as cold as @entity5 's @entity4 has been discovered 7.2 light years away			1
the chilly brown dwarf , which would be the fourth closest system to our sun , was spotted by @entity10 's @entity9 telescope and the @entity24 ( artist 's impression of the star shown ) ' it is very exciting to discover a new neighbour of our solar system that is so close , ' said @entity31 , an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at @entity34 and a researcher in the @entity36 for @entity37			1
' in addition , its extreme temperature should tell us a lot about the atmospheres of planets , which often have similarly cold temperatures			0
' brown dwarfs start their lives like stars , as collapsing balls of gas , but they lack the mass to burn nuclear fuel and radiate starlight			0
the newly - found brown dwarf , named @entity54 , is thought to have a chilly temperature between -48 ° @entity56 ( -54 ° f to 9 ° f )			1
previous record holders for coldest brown dwarfs , also found by @entity9 and @entity59 , were about room temperature			1
although it is very close to our solar system , @entity54 is not an appealing destination for human space travel in the distant future			2
' any planets that might orbit it would be much too cold to support life as we know it , ' @entity31 said			0
' this object appeared to move really fast in the @entity9 data , ' said @entity31			0
' that told us it was something special			0
' the closer a body , the more it appears to move in images taken months apart			0
above you can see how the star was tracked over two periods by the @entity9 and @entity59 telescopes airplanes are a good example of this effect : a closer , low - flying plane will appear to fly overhead more rapidly than a high - flying one			1
@entity9 was able to spot the rare object because it surveyed the entire sky twice in infrared light , observing some areas up to three times			0
cool objects like brown dwarfs can be invisible when viewed by visible - light telescopes , but their thermal glow - even if feeble - stands out in infrared light			2
after noticing the fast motion of @entity54 in march , 2013 , @entity31 spent time analysing additional images taken with @entity59 and the @entity104 telescope on @entity105 in @entity106			2
@entity59 's infrared observations helped to determine the frosty temperature of the brown dwarf			1
@entity59 is designed to detect infrared radiation , which is primarily heat radiation			0
its highly sensitive instruments allow scientists to peer into cosmic regions that are hidden from optical telescopes , including dusty stellar nurseries , the centres of galaxies and newly forming planetary systems			0
the telescope 's infrared ' eyes ' also allows astronomers see cooler objects in space , like failed stars , extrasolar planets , giant molecular clouds and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets			0
@entity59 was launched on august 25 , 2003 and was designed to have a lifespan of at least two - and - a - half years			0
over the past decade @entity59 has taken over two million images of the @entity135 , which have now been stitched together to create the panorama			0
it has spent 172 days or 4,142 hours taking pictures of the ‘ disk ’ or plane of the @entity135 in infrared light			0
@entity54 is estimated to be three to 10 times the mass of @entity143			2
with such a low mass , it could be a gas giant similar to @entity143 that was ejected from its star system			2
but scientists estimate it is probably a brown dwarf rather than a planet since brown dwarfs are known to be fairly common			1
combined detections from @entity9 and @entity59 , taken from different positions around the sun , enabled the measurement of its distance through the parallax effect			1
this is the same principle that explains why your finger , when held out right in front of you , appears to jump from side to side when you alternate left - eye and right - eye views			0
@entity166 is the fourth closest stellar system to our sun , although it is not thought to either be habitable itself or able to host any habitable planets			1
however , its discovery suggests there could be more such ' hidden ' brown dwarfs lurking near us that are waiting to be discovered in march of 2013 , @entity31 's analysis of the images from @entity9 uncovered a pair of much warmer brown dwarfs at a distance of 6.5 light years , making that system the third closest to the @entity181 his search for rapidly moving bodies also demonstrated that the outer solar system probably does not contain a large , undiscovered planet , which has previously been referred to as ' @entity186 ' or ' @entity187			1
' ' it is remarkable that even after many decades of studying the sky , we still do not have a complete inventory of the sun 's nearest neighbors , ' said @entity194 , the project scientist for @entity59 at @entity10 's @entity195 ( @entity195 ) , which manages and operates @entity59			1
' this exciting new result demonstrates the power of exploring the universe using new tools , such as the infrared eyes of @entity9 and @entity59			2

an extremely cold star has been found in our cosmic neighbourhood
*dubbed* @entity54 , it is a so - called brown dwarf star
it could be as chilly as -48 ° c , making it one of the coldest stars ever found
the star was found using @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity59 space telescopes
if confirmed as a star , it would be the fourth closest system to our sun
however , some *theories* suggest it could also be a @entity143 - style planet
