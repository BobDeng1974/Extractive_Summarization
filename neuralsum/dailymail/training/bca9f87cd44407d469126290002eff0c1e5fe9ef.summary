the gulls set up camp in her back garden to protect a nest in the chimney - and ' flapped and pecked ' at ms @entity8 every time she went outside			1
ms @entity8 said she and 67 - year - old brother @entity23 were stuck inside her home in @entity25 , @entity26 , for four days			1
she said : ' it was terrifying , absolutely terrifying			0
i felt like a prisoner			0
' i could n’t get to my washing , i could n’t even leave the house from the back door because the gulls wood swoop at me , squawk , flap their wings and try to scare me away			1
' it was pandemonium - really frightening			0
the father bird would sit on the shed which is about three feet away from the house and flap its wings			2
' they also warn off predators with vomit , so when we tried to go outside , they would vomit on us			0
' ms @entity8 told how gulls first became attracted to her property around eight months ago when she started feeding some birds in her garden			1
from then on , one of the gulls became increasingly aggressive , pecking at her windows with such force that she thought the glass would break			2
the birds set up home on her roof and made a nest in her chimney			1
then at the end of last month , a fledgling fell from the roof into their garden - and since then the birds have not left its side			1
she and her brother @entity23 , who ran a convenience store before he retired , said they have been waiting with baited breath for the little chick to learn to fly so its parents would leave			2
' every time it flapped its wings we thought , " this is it , we ’re free " , ' ms @entity8 said			1
' but eventually after about four days it did fly off and its parents followed too			0
one of the birds which ms @entity8 , 69 , claims held her ' hostage '			1
she took this piicture through the window of her @entity25 , @entity26 the retired residential home worker could n't walk out of her house without the two birds - which had set up camp in her back garden to protect their chick - attacking her by flying at her ' they are like lizards , they are raptors and they have nasty scaly feet			1
i find them very threatening			0
' ms @entity8 , who retired to the seafront less than a year ago , is now calling for action from the @entity100			1
she said : ' i would like to see some sort of @entity102 help and advice for helping to keep them off your roof			2
' i would like the council to start taking this seriously because the centre of town is a mess - it is a real mess			0
' i do really think that something should be done to make sure this does n’t happen to other people			0
i like to see birds from a distance we have a wonderful bird variety in the garden			2

for four days ms @entity8 , who lives with her 67 - year - old brother @entity124 , was holed up inside her home in the picturesque seaside town he said : ' being harassed by the adult birds protecting their young can be difficult to deal with until the fledglings have left the area			1
' the main way to resolve the problem is to proof buildings to prevent the birds nesting in the first place			2
' @entity137 can present a variety of problems , including noise , mess caused by droppings , damage to property , birds swooping on animals and people , and flues becoming blocked by nesting materials			0
' the solution for individual property owners is to undertake bird - proofing measures to deter the gulls from roosting or nesting on their building			0
terror from above : ms @entity8 said : ' it was terrifying , absolutely terrifying			2
i felt like a prisoner ' ms @entity8 told how the torment began about eight months ago when she started feeding the birds in her garden - and now it 's worse than ever ' a range of proofing methods exist , including netting and bird spikes to deter birds from roosting			1
the responsibility for proofing a building rests with the property owner , and not the local authority			0
' problems arising from the aggressive behaviour of birds stealing food from people ’s hands are exacerbated by the feeding of birds by residents and visitors			0
' @entity183 , of the @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 , said : ' regarding gulls , people should not feed them			0
they do get very protective over their young and young birds should be left alone			1
' their parents will be watching them			0
injured birds can be taken to any vet who will deal with them with no charge to the finder			0
