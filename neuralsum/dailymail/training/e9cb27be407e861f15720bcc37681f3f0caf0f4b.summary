@entity0 blasted on his blog , @entity7 , that the controversial move at the @entity9 in @entity10 was ‘ unhygienic ’			1
‘ no jumpsuit , no singlet , just a nappy			0
and a disposable one at that , ’ @entity0 wrote			1
maybe @entity1 does n’t mind if bubba poos on her cowboy boots , but other people might object to the side spray			2
’ giving his opinion after @entity1 hit back at critics for her decision not to make her daughter a fashion subject , @entity0 said he was ‘ sick of selfish , blinkered mothers , using public areas as toilet stops for kids ’			1
he listed times that he has been shocked by some mothers ’ behaviour in recent weeks			0
‘ i ’ve seen a woman change her baby ’s nappy across the aisle in @entity44 on a plane and – at a ritzy restaurant in @entity51 ’s crown complex - a mother changed nappies at the table			2
sure , she moved to an unoccupied table but some other unsuspecting diner would be using that seat soon			0
@entity0 said he 's fed up of ' selfish , blinkered mothers , using public areas as toilet stops for kids ’ ‘ i support the campaign for mothers to breast - feed in public			1
it is a disgrace when people urge them to retire to the toilets			0
’ he concluded : ‘ i would n’t eat in a lavatory and do n’t expect a baby to			0
i also would n’t use bum wipes in public or take kids to a red carpet event clad only in their underpants			2
’ the former host of @entity71 spotted @entity0 ’s blog and responded on @entity73 by calling it : ‘ very hurtful , very inaccurate but thanks for the free shame			2
’ @entity0 told @entity77 that when he first saw the photos he thought ' she 's silly ' and that ' it 's really wrong and inappropriate			2
' he felt compelled to write the blog post afer his recent experiences with mothers changing their babies in public ' i think it 's happening more and more , this mummy power in recent times , the thing i was very keen to differentiate is that i 'm not getting involved in the breast feeding debate , i one thousand percent agree with it			1
' he said taking a baby to a premiere in just a nappy ' was very inappropriate ' and possibly a publicity stunt			2

he also questioned whether a parent ' worth their salt ' would be caught without a change of clothes			0
the radio personality said the criticism she received was completely unwarranted and the last thing she was trying to do by letting her youngest daughter @entity3 dress appropriately for the warm weather was to draw attention to herself			1
the media personality also attended the premiere with husband @entity129 ( left ) and two older daughters @entity131 , 12 , and @entity132 , 10 ' i 've been to a pile of premieres this year and am never the most interesting person there			1

' yesterday i attended the premiere of @entity9 with my husband and three daughters because the two older ones were excited to see the film and my husband loves @entity148			1

' the thing that makes me sad is my husband was so proud to see his wife and baby daughter getting their photo snapped on the red carpet , ' ms @entity1 said			1
' he thought @entity3 was so cute and calm in the face of all those flashing cameras			0
and then when we saw that article this morning it was so incredibly judgmental and hostile it actually made my hair stand up on end			0
' " baby wears nappy " is hardly news : it 's a breathtakingly sexist attack - and if i am the person who attracts that sort of confected scandal , that 's sad for me			2
but leave my baby daughter out of it , ' the media personality said			0

' there was only one fashion faux pas on the red carpet ... it was n’t a celebrity revealing a little too much			0

' mr @entity114 said that as a father of two children , and expecting another , he would have ensured that his kids would have worn at least a singlet and nappy cover			0
the @entity9 premiere , though a red carpet event at @entity257 on @entity258 , was a casual affair , attended by celebrities and their children , as well as ordinary families			1
