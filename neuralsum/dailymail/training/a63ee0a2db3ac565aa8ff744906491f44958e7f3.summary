by @entity0 if you 've ever doubted the reach of @entity5 's most popular character , astronomers have spotted @entity6 on another planet			0
photographer @entity8 was trying to capture storms on the planet when he spotted a familiar face			2
the three circular storms were perfectly arranged to form the outline of the much - loved character 's face			1
the fifth planet out from the @entity24 , @entity19 is two and a half times more massive than all the other planets in the solar system combined			1
it is made primarily of gases and is therefore known as a ' gas giant '			0
the fourth brightest object in the solar system , only the @entity24 , @entity32 and @entity33 are brighter			1
it is 120 time bigger than @entity35			0
experts say the planet is going through a particularly stormy phase			0
' we told you this was going to be a good season to observe @entity19 , and astrophotographers in the northern hemisphere have been making the most of this time of opposition where @entity19 has been riding high in the sky , ' said @entity48			2
according to the photographer @entity8 , @entity6 is actually ' two anticyclones ( high pressure regions ) that form the ears while a longer elongated cyclone ( low pressure ) forms the face			1
' @entity8 captured several views of the @entity6 storm the abundance of storms on @entity19 are a result of the planet ’s dense atmosphere of hydrogen and helium and large gravitational field , experts say			1
storms on this planet are likely the strongest in the @entity69			2
one , the @entity70 , is a huge storm on @entity19 , and has raged for at least 350 years			1
it is so large that three earths could fit inside it			0
