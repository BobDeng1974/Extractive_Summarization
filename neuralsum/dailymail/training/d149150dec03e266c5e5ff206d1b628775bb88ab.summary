everything was as expected at the @entity1 on monday – @entity2 defeated @entity3 and are already well placed to reach the quarter - finals of a competition that is almost designed to stop the smaller teams progressing			1
there was no surprise , no real sense of an upset about @entity2 ’s ability to chase down @entity3 304 for seven with 25 balls in hand in @entity14 , just a grim realisation that a side with a proud cricketing heritage are in big trouble			1
@entity3 , racked by in - fighting , have been an accident waiting to happen at this @entity1 and , in a strong and purposeful @entity2 , they came up against the perfect team to take advantage of their vulnerability in their opening game			1
@entity2 's batsman @entity26 ( right ) and team - mate @entity27 celebrate their win over @entity3 @entity2 celebrate as the beaten @entity3 side trudge off the field in @entity14 after their defeat @entity32 hit a crucial knock of 84 to set @entity2 up for the victory in their opening @entity36 game @entity39 fans celebrate their side 's stunning start to their @entity1 campaign after the win over the @entity3 the @entity39 fans made quite the spectacle in @entity45 as they looked forward to a successful tournament this is the third time @entity2 , crammed with experienced county cricketers , have defeated a ‘ big ’ team at a @entity1 and can now add the scalp of @entity3 to those of @entity52 in 2007 and , of course , @entity54 four years ago			1
there is a sense of grievance in @entity39 cricket about their lack of games against @entity65 nations , the decision of the @entity56 to reduce the next @entity1 to 10 teams and @entity54 ’s habit of poaching their players			1
well , this was the perfect way for them to show that they are deadly serious about their desire to not only play more one - day internationals but also to gain the full test status that they crave			0
and there were plenty of @entity39 who were claiming that @entity80 , the @entity81 now captaining @entity54 at this @entity1 , would struggle to get in their side now anyway			2
and that was no @entity39 joke			0
it looked as though @entity2 might have blown their chance when they allowed @entity3 to recover from the depths of 87 for five to reach a total that they should have been able to defend , however good the @entity92 pitch			1
yet it is fair to say that @entity2 ’s successful chase never really looked in doubt and would have been even more convincing had they not suffered a late stutter which saw them eventually lose six wickets in cantering home			1
at the centre of what will go down as another significant day for @entity2 were four players well known in @entity54 for their stature in the domestic game			2
firstly @entity104 , the @entity105 left - arm spinner , took three wickets before @entity107 , with 102 from 84 balls , and @entity109 , who hit four sixes in his 89 , rescued @entity3 from complete embarrassment			1
@entity112 was named man of the match after impressing with the bat against the @entity3 @entity2 batsman @entity27 celebrates their win over the @entity3 on monday @entity117 was one of @entity2 's success stories as he helped them chase down the @entity3 @entity112 fell just six runs short of his century but laid the foundations for @entity2 's triumph the @entity39 fans were in the mood to party as they watched their side win their @entity1 opener @entity3 ' @entity128 cries in anguish ( left ) as @entity26 is congratulated by @entity109 ( right ) then @entity112 , @entity32 and @entity130 , all prolific county performers , showed a calmness and authority with the bat that @entity3 and their rookie captain @entity128 had no answer to			1
@entity112 , the hard - hitting @entity138 opener , led the way with 92 despite being struck on the helmet by @entity141 before @entity142 ’s @entity117 took control of the middle of the innings and @entity146 ’s @entity130 supplied the finish			1
this was another triumph for @entity117 who , at 36 , is playing the best cricket of his career and could have achieved the ambition of playing test cricket that led to him defecting to @entity54 had he stayed with his adopted country			0
instead the man who once scored a century for @entity54 against @entity158 at the @entity159 and played for them in the 2007 @entity1 in the @entity160 has now set his sights on playing the ultimate game for his own nation			2
if he carries on like this you would not put it past him			0
conversely , these are grim times for @entity3			2
they still use the @entity172 ’s ‘ @entity171 the @entity3 ’ as their national anthem and never has that calypso anthem been more apt than in their current chaotic plight			2
they arrived here without two of their best players in @entity178 and @entity179 , banished for their leading roles in instigating strike action in @entity182 in october , and with poor @entity128 having to lead them at the age of just 23			0
they were a rabble in a warm - up game against @entity54 last week which led to their manager @entity186 , one of the many great @entity188 players let down by the current generation , saying they did not want to peak too early			0
on this evidence they are not going to peak at all and face an early exit from this elongated tournament if they do not buck their ideas up quickly			0
@entity104 took three wickets for @entity2 after the @entity3 were put into bat first @entity26 held his nerve to guide @entity2 through the final balls and to victory @entity107 hit a century for the @entity3 but he was not backed up by his team - mates a dejected @entity109 speaks to the media after his @entity3 slumped to defeat @entity202 of the @entity3 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity112 @entity2 fans dressed to impress as they watched their side chase down the @entity3 @entity206 knows what @entity3 team @entity54 will face in the @entity160 in april as their better players will prefer to cash in at the @entity209 at the same time , the perfect example of their modern day priorities			1
‘ it was a tough loss , ’ said @entity128 , a promising fast bowler whose development can only be stifled by having to captain the side			0
‘ we backed ourselves to defend 304 but we leaked too many boundaries and could n’t do it			0
’ a measure of @entity2 ’s ambition came in the matter of fact way they greeted victory			2
‘ it was great to get our first victory , ’ said @entity112 in expectation of gaining several more			2
‘ i owed the lads 90 after dropping @entity109 on nought			0
’ @entity228 , the @entity2 captain , was equally sanguine when he said : ‘ hopefully this sets us up for the next few games and we are in a great position now			0
our belief has been growing for a while now and we know what we ’re capable of			0
we did n’t just feel we could win this game but others too			0
’ it is in many ways a great shame that @entity80 and @entity239 , who @entity54 still want in their set - up despite his chastening @entity242 tour , do not play for their own country and @entity2 are desperate to stop the drain of talent			1
they are not impressed either that @entity54 ’s bi-annual fixture against @entity2 can only be fitted in this summer at @entity247 on may 8 , immediately after @entity54 ’s tour of the @entity160 , effectively ruling out their main players			1
yet if they can carry on like this – and the @entity56 give them a fairer crack of the whip – then all @entity39 cricketers really could be encouraged to stay at home .			0

@entity2 put the @entity3 into bat and they made 304 - 7 from 50 overs
@entity107 ( 102 ) and @entity109 ( 89 ) were their best performers
but @entity112 , @entity32 and @entity26 all impressed for @entity2
@entity26 and @entity27 saw them home with 25 balls to spare in @entity14
