by @entity0 a killer doctor is suing one of his victim ’s sons for heckling him as he was about to give a speech , forcing him to abandon the event and miss dinner			2
@entity8 , who was working as an overseas locum gp , gave victim @entity10 , 70 , ten times the recommended amount of diamorphine in 2008			1
mr @entity10 ’s sons @entity14 and @entity15 disrupted an event where @entity8 was speaking in @entity17 , calling him a ‘ charlatan ’ and ‘ killer ’			1
now disgraced @entity8 – who can still practise in @entity17 , where mention of his role in mr @entity10 ’s death is forbidden under strict ‘ data protection ’ laws – is demanding almost 3,400 euros , equivalent to £ 2,800 compensation			1
confronted : @entity8 is heckled by the two sons of one of his victims , @entity10 , in @entity17 in 2010			1
@entity29 , pictured right , is stopped by security as he disrupts the disgraced doctor 's speech the sum covers the cost of dinner , expenses and the fee for his speech , which was not paid			2
in 2010 , an inquest found that mr @entity10 , of @entity42 , @entity43 , had been unlawfully killed and an arrest warrant was issued for @entity8			1
but the doctor had returned to @entity17 and a deal was reached under which he was sentenced there – receiving a nine - month suspended jail term and fine for a lesser charge of causing death by medical negligence			0
he was banned from practising in the @entity52 after being struck off by the @entity53			0
however , @entity8 has been able to continue working in @entity17 because , although the country ’s equivalent of the @entity53 would like him to be banned , doctors are licensed by their local council			2
anger : @entity59 ( right ) and his brother @entity14 ( left ) disrupted a speech he was giving at a conference on plastic surgery in the @entity17 town of @entity65 in 2010 , calling him a ' charlatan and killer			2
' after @entity8 , 71 , was banned from practising in the @entity52 following the inquest , mr @entity10 ’s sons discovered their father ’s killer was giving a speech on plastic surgery in @entity65 , @entity75			1
@entity14 , now 54 and a @entity9 in the @entity76 , and scientist @entity15 , 49 , who lives in @entity17 , attended the event in june 2010 to confront him			1
during the incident , @entity8 replied : ‘ show me the doctor who has not made a mistake			0
’ now @entity59 ’s lawyers have received a letter from a court in @entity65 saying @entity8 is seeking 3,398 euros plus costs			0
mr @entity10 is liable because he lives in @entity17 , where he works for its equivalent of the @entity86			1
he said : ‘ @entity8 ’s move beggars belief but it is not a surprise because he has told so many lies			0
tragedy : @entity10 died after being given a massive overdose of painkillers by dr @entity8 ‘ he has no moral compass or integrity – what sort of person would commit an unlawful killing then try to extricate money from his victim ’s family ? ’ mr @entity10 said he had obtained paperwork showing @entity8 was only qualified to run a cosmetic surgery clinic before he came to the @entity52 – but was able to move to the @entity52 under @entity106 law because he had a @entity17 medical licence			1
‘ he pretended to have medical knowledge he did n’t have in order to work in the @entity52 to make money , ’ @entity15 said			0
‘ there is no evidence he trained or qualified to be a gp			0
’ @entity113 - born @entity8 , who is still allowed to practise as a plastic surgeon in @entity115 , an industrial town in @entity17 ’s @entity117 , has given mr @entity10 two weeks to answer his case , which could lead to a full court hearing			1
mr @entity10 said @entity8 had already made two unsuccessful attempts in the @entity17 courts to sue him and take out an injunction preventing his family from speaking out			1
but the third case has now been allowed to proceed			0
‘ i am defending it , of course , ’ he said			0
his brother @entity14 , who lives in @entity128 , @entity129 , said : ‘ @entity15 is only liable because he ’s living in @entity17			2
after all @entity8 has done to our family , this is the final insult			0
’ he added : ‘ in @entity17 , data protection rules prevent anyone making public any details about what @entity8 did to our father			2
in my opinion , @entity8 has no morals – he ’s a weasel			0
’ the inquest into their father ’s death heard that @entity8 was on his first shift in the @entity52 as a locum when he killed the pensioner , whom he injected with 100mg of diamorphine – ten times the recommended maximum dose			1
evidence at the hearing in @entity154 , @entity43 , suggested he had also inappropriately treated at least two other patients			0
@entity17 police documents later showed neither the university where @entity8 claimed to have studied nor the state examination office had a record of his ever having sat the state medical exam			2
horrified : @entity59 ( pictured with his girlfriend @entity161 ) said it is ' disgusting ' dr @entity8 is still allowed to practice after his he allegedly fed his father a massive overdose of pankillers			0

@entity8 gave @entity10 ten times recommended dose of diamorphine
his sons @entity14 and @entity15 interrupted @entity8 's speech at an event in @entity17
mention of @entity8 's role in mr @entity10 's death is forbidden in @entity17 by law
he is now suing mr @entity10 's two sons for £ 2,000 compensation
