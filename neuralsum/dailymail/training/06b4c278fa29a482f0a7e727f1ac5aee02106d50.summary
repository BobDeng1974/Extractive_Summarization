@entity19 - 8 a terrific performance from the @entity0 captain			1
triple team : @entity0 trio @entity19 , @entity16 and @entity26 challenge @entity24 @entity27 - 7 central defensive partnerships are very important and @entity29 played his part in this one			1

@entity96 - 6 looks a real athlete again and did his job simply and efficiently here			0

@entity24 - 5.5 he could be the long - term casualty of @entity102 ’s arrival if he does n’t raise his game			1

could have had a penalty in the first half			0
@entity107 - 7 a really promising debut from the record signing			1
