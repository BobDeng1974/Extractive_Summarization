@entity0 created the first live - action high drama on the @entity3 floor wednesday , staking out a no - compromise position on blocking @entity6 's sweeping immigration plan and reading aloud 22 examples of the president 's past claims that he lacked the authority to put it into action			1
@entity6 outlined the plan on nov. 20 , promising to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants by guaranteeing – without input from @entity15 – that they wo n't be deported during his time in office			1
angering @entity19 , the @entity3 speaker spoke during a floor debate to defend an amendment to the @entity23 's budget bill that would forbid the cabinet agency from spending any money to implement it			1
@entity0 openly mocked @entity6 for what he said was an effort to evade the @entity28 , throwing in his face his past claims that he was n't a ' king ' or an ' emperor			1
' the @entity28 explicitly gives @entity15 the power to control @entity35 's immigration policies			2
' he did n't just learn constitutional law			1
' ' enough is enough ! ' the move came less than 24 hours after @entity0 and other @entity55 leaders met with @entity6 in the @entity3 to air their differences over legislation that would likely make up the bulk of congressional business for in the coming months			1
on wednesday , @entity0 was in no mood to compromise			0
@entity6 's unilateral move , he said , is an ' executive overreach ... an affront to the rule of law and to the @entity28 itself			1
' ' what we are dealing with here is a president who has ignored the people , ignored the @entity28 , and even his own past statements , ' he said			1
' in fact , on at least 22 occasions he has said he does not have the authority to do what he did			0
' and then @entity0 read them			0
@entity6 , he recalled , told an @entity77 , @entity79 audience in may 2011 that immigrants ' - rights activists ' wish i could just bypass @entity15 and change the law myself			1
but that ’s not how a democracy works			0
' the president also insisted in an october 2010 interview with the spanish - language @entity88 that ' i am president ; i am not king			0
i ca n't do these things just by myself			0
… i ca n't just make the laws up by myself			0
' in an online q - and - a session held in september 2011 , @entity6 told viewers : ' we live in a democracy			2
you have to pass bills through the legislature , and then i can sign it			0
' he doubled down in a february 2013 @entity105 ' hangout ' video livestream , saying he was limited in his authority because ' i ’m the president of the @entity35 ; i 'm not the emperor of the @entity35			0
' @entity19 demanded a roll - call vote on the amendment following @entity0 's litany , after hammering republicans for being ' anti-immigrant ' and ' heartless			2
' the amendment passed by a vote of 237 to 190			2
another amendment aimed at ending the president 's ' @entity115 ' ( @entity115 ) program also passed , 218 - 209			1
@entity115 is a 2012 program that gives sanctuary to illegal immigrants who weer brought to the @entity35 > as children			2
the overall @entity23 funding bill also passed , by a 236 - 191 margin			1
@entity124 , a communications advisor to the speaker , told @entity127 that @entity6 has ' said over and over that he did not have the authority to do what he eventually did			2
so his unilateral action sets a very troubling precedent , and not just on immigration			0
that ’s what the speaker wanted to drive home			0
' but @entity137 democrat @entity136 insisted that the ' @entity138 ' in the @entity28 – which demands that the president ' shall take care that the @entity141 be faithfully executed ' – gives @entity6 the power to decide which illegal immigrants are deported and which are allowed to stay			1
she accused the @entity143 of ' play [ ing ] politics with the security and safety of @entity35			0
' @entity79 @entity19 rep. @entity149 went further , calling the @entity143 amendment ' a full - force assault on immigrants ' and described it as ' @entity23 being held hostage			1
' ' a full - force assault on immigrants ' : @entity79 @entity136 @entity149 slammed the @entity143 's plan , arguing that they were trying to hold the homeland security budget ' hostage showdown : @entity0 and @entity3 @entity143 aim to force @entity6 into a take - it - or - leave - it veto position on the @entity23 's budget for the rest of the year the tension will reach its climax in coming weeks when a @entity23 budget reaches @entity6 's desk			1
the @entity3 has a veto of any plan that hamstrings him on immigration , and most democrats will support him			1
that sets up the possibility of a @entity23 ' shutdown ' after its funding runs out on february 27			2
@entity19 claim a shutdown would jeopardize national security in the wake of the @entity182 massacre in @entity183 , an attack for which @entity185 in @entity186 claimed responsibility on wednesday			0
but if the last partial shutdown is any indication , critical agencies and services would n't be affected			0
the budget bill , including the amendment , still has to go through the @entity195 , where majority leader @entity196 has promised the new @entity19 minority that they will be permitted to propose their own amendments			0
any differences between the resulting @entity3 and @entity195 bills will have to be ironed out in a conference committee – a uniquely @entity35 device that puts leaders from both parties and both houses in the same room to resolve them .			0

house speaker mocks @entity6 for going outside the @entity28 after teaching constitutional law
president ' has ignored the people , ignored the @entity28 , and even his own past statements '
@entity143 aim to use @entity23 funding bill to kill @entity6 's plan to mainstream 5 million or more illegal immigrants

@entity143 budget amendment that would hamstring @entity6 passed 237 - 190
