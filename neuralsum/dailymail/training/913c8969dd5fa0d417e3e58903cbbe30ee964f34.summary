by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 7 june 2013 danger to the public : @entity3 was jailed for a minimum of eight years today for raping an 11 - year - old girl while he was on probation a dangerous teenage paedophile was jailed for a minimum of eight years today for raping an 11 - year - old girl while he was on probation			1
@entity3 , 18 , from @entity11 , north @entity12 , had just left his probation officer when he spotted the child going home from school on a bus before following her and dragging her into a park to subject her to a three - hour rape ordeal			1
mr @entity20 at the @entity21 told @entity3 that he had given careful consideration to whether he could impose a lesser sentence than life , for example a determinate sentence combined with an extended term			1
' however , in all the circumstances of this case , i do not believe that the public would be adequately protected from you if you were the subject of any sentence other than a life sentence , ' he said			0
the judge told @entity3 that the eight - year minimum was not the actual term he would serve , but the minimum before he could be considered for release by the @entity40			1
' @entity41 will only direct your release on licence if it is satisfied that you are no longer a danger to members of the public , ' he added			0
@entity3 had been given an 18 - month supervision order six months before for making indecent images of children			1
a year earlier , he had sexually assaulted and robbed a 12 - year - old schoolgirl on a housing estate			1
later , he was given a 10 - month detention and training order which he went on to breach			1
he was found guilty of rape following a trial at the @entity21 in april after he had denied raping the girl in @entity59 , @entity60 , north @entity12 , in november , last year			1
the child gave evidence against him on videolink during the trial			0
the judge told @entity3 : ' you got off the bus at the same stop as her and you then followed her			1
you dragged her into @entity59 and subjected her to a horrific ordeal for the next three hours			0
' not only did you rape her at least twice			2
you stuffed one of her gloves in her mouth			1
you threatened her and said that you had a knife although you did not in fact produce one			2
' you told her not to tell anyone about what had happened because you would stab her			2
even the risk of being seen by a member of the public did not deter you from carrying on with your vicious attack on your lonely and vulnerable victim			1
' at one point you even told her that the incident was being filmed and that you would send the video to her school where people would laugh at her			2
' the girl suffered injuries which meant she had to go to hospital where she had to be examined under anaesthetic and needed stitches			2
' perhaps even worse , you have left her with terrible emotional scars			0
one can only hope that , with the courage that she has already shown in giving evidence at this trial , and with the support of her family and friends , she can begin the process of recovery			0
' the judge said that until recently @entity3 had shown no remorse for the terrible offence he had committed			1
' since your conviction you now accept that you did commit this offence			0
' a psychiatric report stated that he had ' a small insight ' into his offence ' but this does provide a platform for you to work within a sexual offenders treatment programme '			0
the judge added : ' however , i approach the degree of your apparent remorse with some caution			2
i had the opportunity to observe you when you gave evidence at your trial			0
it is clear to me that you are well capable of lying and of manipulating others around you to suit your own interests			0
' @entity3 was ' an intelligent young man who had potential '			2
mr @entity20 but the judge added : ' it is also clear that you have an unhealthy interest in little girls			2
' he had told both a probation officer and a psychiatrist that he ' had been planning to rape a girl for about two months before the offence , although the offence itself was committed on impulse '			1
it was not disputed by @entity3 ’s counsel that he was dangerous , the judge added			1
@entity151 said in a statement that forensic samples found on @entity3 ’s trainers , white bag strap and underwear all directly linked him to the victim			1
his fingerprints were also found on the victim ’s oyster card holder			0
cell site analysis of his mobile phone also placed him in the vicinity of the park at the time of the attack			0
' an unhealthy interest in little girls ' : @entity169 shows @entity3 boarding the bus where he spotted his victim the paedophile , carrying a white bag , walks to a seat : he told authorities he had been planning to rape a youngster detective chief inspector @entity177 , who led the investigation , said : ' @entity3 posed a great danger to young girls and despite the great weight of evidence against him , refused to accept his guilt and forced the victim to give evidence in court			1
' this was a particularly brutal but unusual attack on an innocent 11 - year - old schoolgirl who will no doubt continue to suffer the emotional scars of what happened to her for a very long time			1
i would like to take this opportunity to praise the bravery of the victim and her family			0
' mr @entity177 also told reporters at the court : ' his offending escalation and lack of victim empathy is a clear indication of his dangerousness			2
' the risk he posed had been registered by the police and its partners			0
' the offence itself was committed on impulse ' : it was not disputed by @entity212 s counsel that he was dangerous evil intent : @entity3 walks towards the bus 's exit , following his victim to where he would rape her officers raised their concerns with a multi-agency public protection forum or @entity222 which planned imminently to apply for an order which would establish some control over the risk he posed , but unfortunately @entity3 committed this offence before this could happen			1
mr @entity177 said a case review was going on into what happened			0
' my organisation has done more than its statutory obligations , ' he said			0
a @entity233 spokeswoman said : ' our deepest sympathies are with the victim and their family following this horrific crime			0
' @entity239 ( @entity222 ) @entity240 into what happened in this case has been launched			0
it would be inappropriate to comment further until this is completed			0
