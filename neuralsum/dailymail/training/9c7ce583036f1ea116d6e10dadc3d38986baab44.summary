by @entity0 rugby league great and one of the @entity4 's star recruits , senator @entity5 , is on the back foot today amid claims he has been ripping off information from @entity10 to inform followers about his state of @entity13			1
the accusations of plagiarism stem from his personal website @entity18 , where details about the state 's primary industries appear to have been simply cut and pasted onto his page			1
local media reports suggests the new senator has been sidestepping questions about his party leader 's controversial comments about @entity29			1
as a senator , @entity5 , enjoys a base salary of more than $ 195,000 plus a raft of entitlements including travel			2
it 's been a tough initiation for one - time football great , heckled during his maiden speech , accused of going to ground by sections of the media and now this			2
it remains unclear as to who actually posted the content for the ' about @entity13 ' dropdown on his website			2
and the words used to describe the role of the @entity68 and a member 's role in it , strike a remarkably close resemblance to the details provided on the site of @entity42 's @entity5 , @entity75			1
what a week to forget for the @entity4			2
@entity47 ( right ) and senator @entity48 have been embroiled in the war of words of @entity42 's relationship with @entity29 and now @entity68 leader @entity5 is in hot water the following are the second and third paragraphs on senator @entity5 ' website : ' @entity13 is the largest state and the third most populated with a population of some 4,560,059 people			1
the capital and largest city in the state is @entity88 , @entity42 ’s third largest city			2
referred to as the ‘ @entity13 ’ , @entity13 is home to 10 of @entity42 ’s 30 largest cities and is the nation ’s third largest economy			1
the state was named in honour of @entity95 , who on 6 june 1859 signed @entity96 separating the colony from @entity98			0
the date 6 june is now celebrated state - wide as @entity100			2
queen @entity95 , who went on to become @entity102 ’s longest reigning monarch , chose an eponymous name for the colony over @entity105 , which had been suggested by the influential local presbyterian minister @entity106 in honour of navigator @entity108			0
@entity13 achieved statehood with the @entity110 on 1 january 1901			0
' @entity4 senators @entity48 ( left ) and @entity5 are making headlines for the wrong reasons before entering politics in 2013 with the @entity4 , @entity5 ( pictured playing for @entity98 against @entity13 ) enjoyed a stellar rugby league career , considered one of the code 's greatest players and the following are excerpts from @entity13 - @entity10 : ' @entity13 ( abbreviated as @entity13 ) is the second - largest and third-most populous state in @entity42			1
' @entity13 has a population of 4,560,059 , concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state 's @entity123			1
' the capital and largest city in the state is @entity88 , @entity42 's third largest city			1
' referred to as the ' @entity13 ' , @entity13 is home to 10 of @entity42 's 30 largest cities and is the nation 's third largest economy			1

@entity13 achieved statehood with the @entity110 on 1 january 1901			0
' apart from some re-ordering of sentences , there appears to be very little differentiation between the two pages			0
reading further , there are arguably too many similarities to be a coincidence			0
as the @entity10 site appears today the words on the @entity13 page of the @entity5 site @entity18 strikes a remarkable resemblance to those on @entity10 ( top ) with senator @entity5 now facing the first real test of his political career , questions are being asked whether the pressure will prove too much to bear , as was the case for his former football team - mate @entity164			1
@entity164 , another rugby league great who starred for the @entity168 side , is remembered for perhaps the country 's most short - lived of political careers			1
in september 2001 , just a few days after deciding he would run as an @entity171 in the @entity173 elections , he pulled out of the race while in his first political interview , saying quite simply : ' i 'm buggered , i 'm sorry			0
i have to resign '			0
@entity177 has sought comment from @entity179 about the allegations but is yet to receive a response .			0

he 's the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) leader in the @entity68
almost 500 words appear to have been lifted from the @entity10 site onto his own to describe his home state of @entity13
claims too that the *description* of the role of @entity68 and those **voted** into it , are *replicated* from the site of fellow senator , @entity171 @entity75
continues a week of *woe* for the @entity4 , the much - *publicised* *newcomers* to @entity200 politics , after @entity47 's *scathing* *criticism* of @entity29 and @entity48 's *assertions* on the same issue
@entity5 entered politics just last year to head @entity4 's @entity68 ticket and was **voted** in on less than 10 *%* primary *votes*
@entity5 won rugby league *premierships* with three different clubs - @entity168 , @entity88 and @entity210
