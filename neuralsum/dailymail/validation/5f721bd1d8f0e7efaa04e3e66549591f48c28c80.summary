they may have been good enough for legendary actor @entity1 and singing superstar @entity2 , but it seems their @entity5 names are now no longer cool			1
it may be unimaginable that you wo n’t be able to call friends ‘ @entity9 ’ and ‘ @entity2 ’ in the future , but according to latest research these once popular names are no longer being used for the next generation			2
according to @entity16 the name @entity15 reached peak popularity in 1952 in the @entity18 , coming in at number nine on the baby names popularity list where there were 38,000 registered @entity22			0
however , in 2013 , only 400 babies were thought good enough to be called @entity15			0
legendary actor @entity1 was the flag - bearer for his @entity5 name in the 1950s in another name shocker , @entity26 revealed that @entity2 , spelled in the same unique way as global superstar @entity2 , was also out			1
@entity2 made her unusually - spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at @entity31 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971			1
to make matters worse the conventional spelling of @entity34 , a top 10 name for three decades , only just gets in the @entity36			1
so no matter how you spell it the name seems a goner			0
@entity2 made her unusually - spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s other names compiled by baby naming website @entity45 that look on the way out are @entity48 as a boy 's name and @entity51 for a girl			1
the popularity of the 2013 @entity55 film inside @entity56 obviously has not rubbed off on cinema - goers			1
a common name in @entity59 , with the distinctive @entity59 double - l beginning , @entity48 appeared on the @entity18 list for six decades			0
bye bye baby : the girl 's name @entity51 is another one that has gone out of fashion but despite its rich @entity59 history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , @entity67 does n't cut it any more			2
while @entity51 , the feminisation of the ancient roman name @entity74 , ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then rose to new heights in 1970 thanks to the popularity of singer @entity79 , only to fall off the charts in 1975			0
@entity51 along with most other once - popular - ine and - een - ending girls ' names are now generally out of favour			2
the once popular @entity59 boy 's name @entity48 is also out when it comes to babies ' names			0

the likes of actor @entity1 made this @entity5 name cool in the 1950s
@entity2 made her condensed first name famous in the 1960s
but even the conventional spelling of ' @entity34 ' is no longer popular
not even @entity55 film inside @entity56 can save the @entity59 name
in fashion in the 1970s , @entity51 is no longer a *trendy* name for a girl
