when @entity0 transformed the musical landscape with her classic albums @entity2 and @entity4 , a wave of talented homegrown divas emerged in her wake , with @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 all becoming major stars			1
but her influence stretched beyond these shores , as @entity15 singer @entity14 acknowledges			1
the 31 - year - old from @entity17 , with a @entity19 figure and voice straight out of the @entity21 , is gaining a substantial following in this country , thanks to appearances on @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
forties chic : new fans for ' the shocking miss @entity14 ' last month , she sold out the @entity31 , and new dates have been added to her autumn tour			1
and a lot of the credit , she admits , should go to @entity0			1
‘ she was my big inspiration , ’ @entity14 says			1
‘ when she came along , there was n’t much jazz or swing in the charts			2
but @entity0 sexed up the whole genre			1
‘ i discovered her while studying jazz at the @entity43			0
i loved the old - school singers but also @entity45 , hip - hop and soul			0
’ @entity0 ’s lead has given @entity14 impressive staying power , too			1
her million - selling debut , @entity51 , this week returned to the @entity53 @entity52 , two years after its first chart run			2
talent : @entity14 bombed out in an audition for @entity15 tv talent show @entity57 and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was discovered singing backup but , as @entity14 explains , her recording career began by accident			1
a struggling session singer in the @entity15 capital , she bombed out in an audition for @entity15 tv talent show ‘ idol ’ and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was invited to sing on a demo tape by @entity73 songwriter @entity72 and two local producers			1
inspiration : late singer @entity0 the song she performed , back it up , was going to be offered to other artists , but her stunning vocals changed all that			1
it became her first single and launched a partnership with her team that is still intact			0
if @entity87 ’s music is built around @entity21 big - band flourishes and smouldering vocals , her image is also a quirky mix of old and new			0
her voluptuous curves are draped in chic vintage clothes on her new album sleeve ; sexy but strangely demure			0
‘ you can be sexy without throwing everything on the table , ’ she insists			0
‘ i would n’t have wanted to live in the @entity98 , though			0
as a woman , i would n’t have the same rights as now			0
i ’m a liberal @entity17 girl , so i would n’t have been happy , but it ’s nice to be nostalgic about the past			0
’ @entity14 ’s new album pushes her music beyond the @entity105 theme of her debut			2
with its dramatic string sections recorded at @entity109 , it harks back to the romance of @entity111 , with @entity112 also nodding to @entity113			0
a stylish sequel , it should further enhance the status of a singer who was once dubbed the ‘ @entity8 ’			2
‘ any comparison with @entity8 is a compliment , though i think my voice is different ’ @entity14 tells me			2
‘ i ’d love to have a beer with her one day			0
’ the @entity87 is out on may 6 on @entity123			0
@entity14 ’s @entity53 tour starts on september 6 at @entity125 ( gigsandtours.com )			1

@entity15 singer @entity14 credits her *success* to late @entity0
