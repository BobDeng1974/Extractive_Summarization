by @entity0 published : 11:05 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 02:39 est , 4 january 2013 @entity1 , a former @entity3 diplomat who sheltered @entity5 citizens in @entity6 during the @entity8 hostage crisis of 1979 , has died aged 88			1
the cool - headed mr @entity9 played a pivotal role in the so - called @entity3 caper when @entity13 operatives posed as members of an @entity16 film production company to rescue @entity5 citizens on the run following the @entity8 revolution			1
the audacious plan was celebrated in last year 's film @entity22 directed by @entity23 , however mr @entity9 did not feature as a character			1
passing : @entity1 , a former @entity3 diplomat who sheltered six @entity5 fugitives following the @entity8 revolution in 1979 had died aged 88 yet so important was his role in the real - life events that his omission from the movie led to accusations that the filmmakers had ' rewritten history '			1
after a mob stormed the @entity5 @entity38 building in @entity6 they took 52 @entity5 hostage in retaliation for @entity42 support for the recently deposed shah			1
however six @entity5 managed to evade capture			1
all six were taken in by @entity9 at his home in the suburbs north of @entity6			1
two then stayed at the home of @entity3 ambassador @entity49 while the other four remained with the @entity50			1
flashpoint : supporters of @entity53 on the streets of @entity6 celebrating following the @entity8 revolution 1979 @entity23 stars as @entity13 operative @entity56 in the 2012 film @entity22 , which told the story of the six @entity5 ' escape describing the tense situation that lasted for an agonising 72 days , mr @entity9 said : ' we were under surveillance			1
' we had tanks at one end of the street and a fellow that walked up and down			2
' @entity68 , one of the @entity5 described mr @entity9 as ' a lifesaver '			1
@entity9 's omission from the film led to accusations that the makers had ' rewritten history ' to avoid tipping off the @entity8 authorities to the @entity5 ' presence , the @entity50 would buy food from several different stores to disguise the amount that was being consumed			1
the six fugitives were eventually driven from @entity9 ’s home to the airport by an @entity8 employee in a @entity3 @entity38 van			1
they boarded a @entity86 flight and were flown to safety on a plane called ' @entity89 '			2
talking to the @entity91 , historian @entity90 described mr. @entity9 as exuding ' the sort of quiet but unyielding resolve that made him a natural leader in a crisis			2
' @entity9 was born in @entity96 and served as a tail gunner in during the @entity98			2
he broke both legs bailing out of a crippled @entity101 bomber over @entity102 , but somehow managed to crawled to a pub and order a drink			2
he recovered and was soon back flying missions over @entity106			2
@entity9 featured in the 1981 @entity3 film , ' escape from @entity8 , ' according to his wife , @entity109 , he was suffering from alzheimer ’s disease and died on dec 30 at a hospital in @entity112			1
the @entity8 hostage crisis was one of @entity5 ’s darkest hours , in november 1979 , @entity8 anti-american protesters had shocked the world by storming @entity6 ’s @entity5 embassy and taking 52 @entity5 hostage			1
they were to be held for the next 444 days			2
but a maverick @entity13 agent persuaded a desperate @entity5 government that the best way of spiriting six trapped diplomats out of the most dangerous place on @entity124 was to turn the golden rule of espionage operations — do n’t attract attention — on its head			1
the six — consular chief @entity129 , agricultural attaché @entity130 , and two young couples , @entity133 and @entity134 , and @entity135 and @entity136 — were split between the homes of the @entity3 deputy chief of mission , @entity1 , and ambassador @entity49			1
@entity8 's current president @entity140 is pictured holding the arm of a blindfolded @entity5 hostage at the @entity5 embassy in 1979 a month after the embassy take - over , @entity13 agent @entity56 , 38 , a veteran of the @entity144 hatched a bizarre plan in which he would reinvent himself as @entity147 , an @entity16 sci - fi film production manager leading a pre-production team into @entity8 on a location - scouting mission			1
@entity56 flew to @entity151 to enlist @entity152 , the make - up artist who had created mr @entity154 ’s ears in @entity155 and who won an @entity157 for the simian masks he made for 1968 ’s @entity159			2
@entity160 brought in a special effects colleague , @entity162			2
the trio took over offices recently vacated by makers of the thriller @entity167 and , in four days , set up their own company			1
mischievously calling it @entity171 , they designed business cards for the six trapped diplomats , and invented cvs of former film credits for each of them			1
@entity56 commissioned a film poster which appeared as a full - page advert in @entity180 trade papers @entity181 and the @entity182			1
they even threw a small launch party			2
soon , the studio was being inundated with scripts , including one from @entity187			0
@entity180 ’s finest were taken in — but would the @entity8 be so easily convinced ? on january 25 , 1980 , after the mission had received the personal approval of president @entity190 , @entity56 flew to @entity8			0
alert to the possibility officials might call to check the story , he left his colleagues manning the phones in @entity151			0
he arrived in @entity6 on an early morning flight , knowing the terminal would be quiet , and wasted little time meeting the @entity3 ambassador , @entity49 , who handed him the six passports his government had made for the @entity5			1
@entity56 , meanwhile , forged the necessary @entity8 visas , using the ambassador ’s scotch to moisten his ink pad			0
that evening , @entity56 met the six and outlined his plan , assigning them roles in the film crew			1
‘ being all fairly young , we did n’t really think about the danger we were in , ’ @entity130 , now 64 , tells me			0
‘ frankly , we were more worried what would happen to our @entity3 hosts if we were caught			1
’ did they think the plan totally ludicrous ? ‘ no , ’ says @entity130 , ‘ because @entity56 told us to be convincing in these situations , you have to like the idea of who you ’re going to be			0
you have to have some fun			0
and as @entity56 had wryly told us : " everyone wants to be from @entity180			0
” ’ over the next two days , @entity56 spent hour after hour drilling his charges , testing them endlessly on their cover stories and getting them used to their new identities			0
in the early hours of january 28 , they all piled into a van to drive to the airport , suitably disguised			0
most had attempted to look as ‘ movie industry ’ as possible , with oversized sunglasses , eccentric hairstyles and lapels so wide they almost did n’t need a plane			0
@entity129 , the conservative consular chief , had gone the whole hog , dressing in a blue silk shirt two sizes too small and unbuttoned to reveal a hairy chest and gold medallion			0
he completed the act with a blow - dried bouffant hairdo and a walk that @entity56 remembers as ‘ ridiculously mincing ’			0
at the airport , the six entered the terminal nervously with @entity56			0
as @entity248 wandered through the queues harassing other travellers , the group checked in smoothly with @entity86 and got through customs			0
@entity56 recalls the six were really embracing their roles by this point			0
‘ we were trying to look like we were having a good time			0
we wanted to be the @entity180 people who did n’t get it — who were out celebrating at the worst time in history			2
it was part of the cover story			0
’ suddenly , disaster loomed			0
@entity130 joined the non-smoking queue for immigration out of habit , while the others stood in the smoking queue			0
separated , he found himself being quizzed by an immigration officer who peered suspiciously at his passport photo and demanded to know if it was really him			0
apparently unconvinced , the officer went into a backroom with the passport			0
the group froze , but mercifully he returned bringing only a cup of tea			0
he shrugged at the passport and stamped it			0
they were almost home and dry			2
as the plane — coincidentally named @entity89 — left @entity8 airspace , bound for @entity285 , @entity56 gripped the bag he had thankfully never had to open : the one full of @entity22 posters , relevant @entity180 magazines and even the film storyboards that he might have needed to convince suspicious officials .			1

@entity1 played a pivotal role in the escape of six @entity5 fugitives
he sheltered four at his home and helped organise @entity3 passports
but he was not featured as a character in last year 's film @entity22
*critics* claim this omission amounted to the film makers ' rewriting history '
