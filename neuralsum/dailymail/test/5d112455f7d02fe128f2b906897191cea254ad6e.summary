this is the moment @entity1 talked himself out of a ticket after leaving his bright green @entity3 parked on yellow lines			1
despite his recent woes , he was seen laughing with a traffic warden in @entity7 , who had tried to put a ticket on his borrowed supercar			1
the warden recognized the former @entity13 host immediately and the pair chatted for a few minutes			1
and the conversation must have been a good one - as the warden then appeared to walk away without leaving a ticket on the eye - catching @entity3			2
he was inspecting the car as if he may have had an interest in buying it			0
after spending around 15 minutes looking at the car , he drove off in his @entity3 , which has @entity33 number plates			0
@entity1 , 55 , was sensationally sacked from @entity13 by the @entity34 last month after a ' fracas ' involving a producer during filming			1
this week @entity38 , 45 , joined @entity39 in confirming he will not return to @entity13 following @entity1 's sacking , insisting on friday he had no plan to ' quit my mates			1
' today , @entity38 told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be ' exciting ' but refused to speculate further on the future of @entity13			2
the former @entity13 presenter stopped for a chat with tennis coach @entity50 after the full - time whistle @entity1 did not seem to entertained by the match between the two @entity7 sides , which was a bore draw @entity1 ( left ) is seen with his @entity13 colleagues @entity39 ( centre ) and @entity38 ( right ) outside his west @entity7 flat this week , in their first public appearance since he was sacked he said : ' everybody knows what 's happened			1

the future , nobody knows yet do they ? ' and i can not and wo n't speculate further than that			0
so do n't know , let 's see			0
it 'll be exciting whatever			0
' @entity38 's resignation marked another blow for the popular show , which has been marred by uncertainty since @entity1 was axed			1
there is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by @entity78 , @entity79 or another @entity81 broadcaster			0
producer @entity82 had his lip split by @entity1 in the march 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries			2
