@entity1 's top strategist said that the campaign will take a ' hard look ' at how to approach future debates in the light of last night 's failure - and appealed to the media to challenge @entity8 on the issues which the president avoided in @entity11			1
all but stating that the @entity13 had won the debate , @entity12 conceded that the performance aspect was ' not the president 's strong suit in these events ' but insisted that ' i do n't see us adding huge amounts of additional prep time			1
' the remarks came after the @entity1 campaign was left reeling by mr @entity8 's knockout performance in the candidates ' first head - to - head clash , with polls suggesting that voters regarded the former governor of @entity31 as the debate winner by a margin of more than two to one			1
mr @entity12 , speaking on a campaign conference call , made an appeal to reporters to make the points that @entity1 himself had failed to make in the debate ' all of you who travel on the road with governor @entity8 know that he just few weeks ago stood up and said we did n't need any more teachers , ' he said			1
' last night he could n't be more enthusiastic about teachers and more teachers			0
' mr @entity8 had delivered ' a very vigorous performance but one that was devoid of honesty ' , mr @entity12 said			2
' and so today , as the day after , i think the question for you [ the media ] , for the @entity73 people is really one of character and whether or not a candidacy that 's so fundamentally rooted in hiding the truth and the facts from the @entity73 people and deception is the basis of trust on which you assign the presidency to a person			0
' so that is what we are going to focus on moving forward			0
we 're going to hold governor @entity8 accountable for the things that he said last night and we 're going to make him justify those claims - as i hope you will make him justify those claims			0
' because we need an an honest and a genuine and realistic plan to move forward and not a bunch of lines designed to get you through a debate			0
' the day after : @entity1 began his quest to resurrect his campaign in @entity11 with a speech to supporters after the disappointing debate the day after : @entity1 used the term ' economic patriotism ' again on thursday in remarks during a campaign event in @entity11 mr @entity12 said that mr @entity8 was ' completely untethered from the truth ' and ' knowingly and willfully tried to deceive senior citizens ' referring to post-debate polls , he added : ' people are willing to give governor @entity8 credit for his performance but that did n't necessarily translate into support for him for president			1
he may win the @entity116 for his performance last night but he ’s not going to win the presidency for his performance last night			0
' he signalled that there would be changes to mr @entity1 's approach to the second debate at @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124 on october 16th			2
' he made a choice last night to answer the questions that were asked and to talk to the @entity73 people about what we need to do to move forward and to not get into serial fact checking with governor @entity8 , which can be an exhausting never ending pursuit			0
' but obviously moving forward we 're going to take a hard look at this and we 're going to have to make some judgements as to where to draw the line in these debates and how to use our time			0
' in terms of changes ... it 's like a play - offs in sports , you evaluate after every contest and you make adjustments and i 'm sure that we will make adjustments			0
i think there will be some strategic judgements that will have to be made and we 'll make them			0
' admission : @entity12 confessed to mr @entity1 's weaknesses and asked the media to push mr @entity8 harder speaking in @entity11 the day after the debate , mr @entity1 took a more aggressive attitude , speaking loudly and assertively as he defended his record in front of a sympathetic crowd			1
' we succeed when the middle class gets bigger , ' he said			0
' we succeed not from the top down but from the middle out			0
' the president also spoke about his energy policy , boasting of the progress his administration has made on renewable energy and adding : ' @entity73 today is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades			0
' he also brought out the harsh words for mr @entity8 which he had largely avoided the night before , saying : ' governor @entity8 may dance around his positions , but if you want to be president , you owe the @entity73 people the truth			2
' mr @entity1 continued : ' governor @entity8 may dance around his positions , but if you want to be president , you owe the @entity73 people the truth			1
' the vocal audience provided a boost which the president was denied during the silent debate , notably when one fan shouted out : ' we believe in you ! ' clash : more than 58 million people tuned in to the @entity1 - @entity8 debate , far more than the total who watched @entity1 - @entity191 in 2008			1
contest : the debate was moderated by @entity194 , who drew criticism for his passive demeanour in the debate itself , however , it was mr @entity8 who was on the offensive , shining in what was arguably the most high - profile moment of his political career so far			2
the @entity13 challenger denounced mr @entity1 's performance over the past four years , and at one point compared the president 's behaviour to that of his sons when they were children			1
‘ look , i ’ve got five boys , ' he said			0
' i ’m used to people saying something that ’s not always true , but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping i ’ll believe it			0
’ from the outset of the debate , mr @entity8 chided mr @entity1 for promising to halve @entity73 ’s annual deficit but instead doubling it and even compared him to a little boy who ca n’t tell the truth			1
hitting mr @entity1 with a blizzard of statistics , mr @entity8 also hit back hard at what he saw as the president mischaracterising his plans : ‘ virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate			1
' mr @entity8 was at the top of his game from the outset , coming across as pithier and punchier than mr @entity1 , who seemed taken aback by being confronted so relentlessly and struggled to speak concisely			2
@entity233 : mr @entity1 hugs first lady @entity234 at the conclusion of the showdown @entity237 : mr @entity8 was joined by several family members , including his wife @entity239 , up on stage in @entity11 the challenger 's dominance came despite his having four minutes less talking time than the incumbent - mr @entity8 spoke for 38 minutes and 32 seconds , while mr @entity1 held the spotlight for 42 minutes and 50 seconds			1
a @entity246 poll of registered voters who watched the debate reflected mr @entity8 's perceived victory , as 67 per cent of respondents regarded him as the night 's winner compared to just 25 per cent for mr @entity1			1
additionally , 58 per cent thought that the @entity13 came across as a stronger leader than the @entity254 , while twice as many said the evening had made them more likely to vote for mr @entity8 as said they were swayed towards the president			1
conservative columnist @entity257 wrote in the @entity258 that ' president @entity1 flailed all around the debate stage ' , adding : ' it was like he had been called in front of the principal after goofing around for four years and blowing off all his homework			2
' he argued that the president looked out of his depth compared to the self - assurance of mr @entity8 , and said : ' who knew anyone on the planet could make @entity8 look easy , relaxed , smooth and human ? ' mr @entity257 concluded : ' not since @entity271 faced @entity272 has the @entity73 presidency been so embarrassingly represented in public			2
actually , that ’s an insult to @entity271			0
' @entity276 , a respected centrist who is a strong supporter of the president , criticised mr @entity1 's ' meandering , weak , professorial arguments ' on the @entity279			1
comedian @entity280 , who has donated $ 1million to a @entity45 super-pac , expressed frustration over mr @entity1 's lacklustre performance in a series of acid tweets throughout the debate			2
at one point , he said : ' @entity8 looks more confident and energetic - he 's about a minute away from holding @entity1 down and cutting his hair			1
