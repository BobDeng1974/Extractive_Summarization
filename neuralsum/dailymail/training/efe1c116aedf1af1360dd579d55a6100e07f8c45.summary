' ' for someone who had just won a majority of 140 seats this was a remarkable statement			0
when i queried it , she said : ' my party wo n't want me to lead them into the next election - and i do n't blame them			1
' ' a graphic example of her detachment from conventional political wisdom and her sense of future political developments			0
' she was forced to stand down as prime minister after her @entity48 refused to back her in a second round of leadership elections			1
@entity1 was replaced by @entity18 ( pictured with wife @entity51 ) in 1990 after her colleagues turned on her she said at the time that pressure from colleagues had forced her to conclude that party unity and the prospect of victory in the next general election would be better served if she stepped down			1
she later described her departure from @entity59 at the hands of the ' grey men ' as ` treachery with a smile on its face '			0
the prime minister had confidently celebrated the tenth anniversary of her premiership in may 1989 having earlier vowed to go ' on and on			1
' but that autumn , she faced the first challenge to her leadership from back - bench mp sir @entity71 acting as a stalking horse			2
he won 33 votes , while another 24 mps spoilt their ballot papers			2
she was the longest serving @entity17 prime minister of the 20th century but @entity1 feared her career may be over as early as 1983			1
her private secretary , @entity20 , composed a private memoir covering his time at @entity23 between december 1981 and june 1984			0
he has now allowed this to be published by the @entity24			0
in one entry , he writes : ' i recall my surprise when she said to me , just two or three days after the @entity11 victory of june 1983 , ' i have not long to go '			2

' mrs @entity1 served as prime minister from 1979 to 1990			1
the following year , with anger over the poll tax leading to riots and her party split over her refusal to allow the pound to be dragged into the @entity108 , her premiership was rocked when her deputy prime minister sir @entity109 quit and gave an electrifying resignation speech to the @entity111			1
it prompted her long term rival , @entity113 , to stand against her in the first genuine test of her leadership			0
she secured 204 votes in the first ballot on november 20 , compared with 152 for mr @entity113			0
but 16 abstentions meant it was four votes short of the necessary 15 per cent victory margin , and so a second ballet was required			0
mrs @entity1 , who had been so confident of winning that she was in @entity123 for a summit meeting , emerged from the @entity125 in @entity126 almost immediately to confirm that she 'd contest a second ballot , insisting : ` i fight on			1
' but as she returned to @entity131 it was clear that @entity11 @entity132 were deserting the prime minister			1

she quit , allowing @entity140 and @entity18 to join the contest			1
mr @entity18 was two votes short of the necessary 187 needed for an outright majority , but his opponents withdrew			2
the following day , november 28 , 1990 , mrs @entity1 left @entity59 for the last time as prime minister			1
standing with her husband @entity146 , she declared : ' we 're happy to leave the @entity17 in a very much better state than when we came here '			0
@entity150 then wept as she was driven to @entity151 to formally tender her resignation to the @entity153 .			0
