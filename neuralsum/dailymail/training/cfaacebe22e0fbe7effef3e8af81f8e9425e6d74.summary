sleeping badly in old age can result in brain changes associated with dementia , say scientists			2
a new study found those who spent less time in deep ‘ slow wave ’ sleep were significantly more likely to lose brain cells than those who slept the most deeply			1
the research also showed that lack of oxygen caused by the snoring condition sleep apnoea increased fourfold the risk of tiny areas of damage in the brain			1
a new study by the @entity18 found older people who spent less time in deep sleep were significantly more likely to lose brain cells than those who sleep deeply these abnormalities are linked with the development of conditions such as @entity25 ’s			1
experts say it is not yet clear if people sleep badly because they are in the early stages of dementia , or if it is the other way round and lack of rest exacerbates the disease process			2
the study , published in the online edition of the journal @entity38 , involved 167 @entity41 @entity40 men from @entity42 with an average age of 84 who had sleep tests conducted at their homes			1
after they died an average of six years later , post mortem examinations were conducted on their brains to look for changes such as loss of neurons and ‘ micro infarcts ’ - areas of dead tissue caused by oxygen starvation			0
these can be triggered by sleep apnoea when the airway becomes repeatedly blocked , often waking sufferers as they struggle for breath			0
the men who had the worst oxygen levels during sleep were four times more likely to have brain damage caused by micro infarcts			1
of the 37 men who spent the least time in slow wave sleep , 17 had brain cell loss compared with seven of the 38 who spent the most time in slow wave sleep			0
experts say it is not clear if people sleep badly because they are in the early stages of dementia , or if it is the other way round ( file picture of elderly woman with @entity25 's ) the results remained the same after taking account of factors such as smoking and bodyweight , and excluding those who died early in the follow - up period			0
however , the study found no association between poor sleep and the brain plaques and tangles that are a hallmark of alzheimer ’s disease			2
lead scientist dr @entity95 , from the @entity18 in @entity94 , @entity42 , said ‘ these findings suggest that low blood oxygen levels and reduced slow wave sleep may contribute to the processes that lead to cognitive decline and dementia			1
‘ more research is needed to determine how slow wave sleep may play a restorative role in brain function and whether preventing low blood oxygen levels may reduce the risk of dementia			1
’ a separate study earlier this week showed that brains of healthy people who were sleepy during the day contained higher levels of a toxic protein called beta - amyloid , which is linked to @entity25 ’s			0
some of those having scans were as young as 50 and none had memory problems			0
dr @entity117 , science communications manager at @entity119 , said of the latest study : ‘ while this suggests that conditions such as sleep apnoea could cause small amounts of damage to the brain , we can not conclude from these results that these sleep disturbances contribute to dementia risk			2
‘ a good night ’s sleep is important for proper brain function in the short term , but we need larger and longer studies in people before we can determine whether disruptions to particular stages of the sleep cycle could impact on memory and thinking skills in later life			0
‘ a healthy diet , plenty of exercise and quitting smoking can help to lower dementia risk and anybody concerned about their memory should speak to their gp			0

found those who do *n't* get enough sleep more likely to lose brain cells
study showed lack of oxygen caused by apnoea increased risk of damage
studied 167 @entity41 @entity40 men from @entity42 with an average age of 84
expert says findings suggest low blood oxygen levels and reduced sleep may contribute to processes that lead to cognitive decline and dementia
