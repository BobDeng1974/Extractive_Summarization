the mid-pitch argument was sparked when @entity0 confronted @entity3 about an overthrow after the last ball of the 23rd over on sunday during the one - day international at the @entity11			1
@entity0 , who has found himself at the centre of more than one sledging controversy this summer , supposedly mouthed - off at the @entity4 batsman over what he perceived to be poor sportsmanship for running off an overthrow that he believed came from a deflection			1
' @entity35 's belief that it was n't a deflection was supported by a replay , but @entity0 says he wo n't apologise despite making the wrong call			1
' i was in the wrong ... i should n't have engaged him , ' he said			0
' if people get on the wrong side of me , i 'm not going to back down			0
' we play hard aggressive cricket but we know what comes with it , sometimes you are going to get fined			0
' we 've just got to keep trying not to cross that line , because we 're all about playing cricket the right way			0
' there 's a so - called unwritten rule in cricket that batsmen do n't run overthrows if the ball deflects off their body or bat			2
while @entity3 hesitated at first , he followed through with the run			2
@entity0 immediately looked on in disbelief as he walked over from his fielding position			2
as he walked past @entity3 he said something and the @entity4 batsman 's response prompted @entity0 to double back			1
@entity0 was caught on camera repeatedly mouthing : ' what ? speak @entity5 '			2
umpires @entity70 and @entity71 were forced to intervene and @entity1 captain @entity72 had to move @entity0 away from the @entity4 batsman			1
@entity0 was fined 50 per cent of his match fee over the incident			1
it kicked off when @entity35 ran a single off an overthrow the @entity1 side believed came after @entity0 's return possibly deflected off @entity3 while @entity3 ( right ) hesitated at first , he followed through with the run and @entity0 ( left ) immediately looked on in disbelief as @entity0 walked past @entity3 he was caught on camera mouthing : ' what ? speak @entity5 ' the clash comes off the back of a four - match @entity86 between @entity88 and @entity35 that was filled with tension and bad blood			1
' i think @entity3 was fine with it , i did n't even bother to ask what really happened , ' @entity35 skipper @entity91 said of the heated confrontation			1
' it was between two grown men and i hope it was sorted out in the middle			0
' the two teams have faced racially - fuelled trouble in the past with @entity4 off spinner @entity103 being banned for three @entity104 back in 2008 for calling @entity88 's @entity105 a ' monkey '			2
@entity109 cricket great @entity107 weighed in on the stoush labelling @entity0 the most juvenile cricketer he has seen			2
@entity107 says he fears that the left - hander could be at the centre of a fight during the @entity115 if things boil over and is advocating a soccer - like yellow and red card system to deal with what he terms ' thuggish behaviour ' as fines do n't work			0
' @entity0 can play , but he is the most juvenile cricketer i have seen on a cricket field , ' @entity107 wrote on cricket website espncricinfo.com			2
' i do n't care how good he is : if he continues to show all those watching that he does n't care , he must be removed , either by @entity129 or definitely by the world governing body			0
' the more he gets away with it , the more others will follow his pitiful actions			0
already we see one or two of his teammates enjoying being close to his hideous energy			0
' umpires @entity70 and @entity71 were forced to intervene and @entity1 captain @entity72 had to move @entity0 away from the @entity4 batsman @entity0 has found himself at the centre of more than one sledging controversy this summer the umpires were forced to step in and separate @entity0 and @entity3 during the heated clash @entity3 , who was 58 at the time , went on to make 137			1
but @entity35 's @entity145 , who made 52 , looked delighted when he took the catch that dismissed @entity0 for 24 during the @entity1 innings			1
@entity88 's @entity148 ended up guiding his side to a four - wicket win over @entity35			1
@entity88 were cruising when they needed 50 runs off the final 10 overs with seven wickets in hand , but the tourists fought back boldly to reduce that equation to 14 runs off 11 balls			0
@entity148 responded with two boundaries , enhancing his status as @entity88 's closer as they passed their victory target of 268 with an over to spare			0
@entity165 scored 96 and his 101 - run partnership with @entity167 piloted @entity88 to a point where they needed 52 runs from 63 deliveries			0
@entity172 reined in his natural aggression , reaching 64 off 96 balls before walloping his first six of the night			0
@entity0 was later dismissed for 24 during the @entity1 innings by @entity35 's @entity145 @entity35 's @entity145 , who made 52 , looked delighted when he took the catch that dismissed @entity0 for 24 during the @entity1 innings @entity35 's total of 8 - 267 , built on the back of @entity3 's masterful 138 , was proven to be sub-par on a pristine batting pitch both he and @entity167 focused instead on swift running between the wickets and the easy ones and twos on offer			1
@entity167 fell for 47 in the 40th over and @entity172 trudged off the following over as @entity88 slumped from 2 - 216 to 6 - 248			0
@entity35 's total of 8 - 267 , built on the back of @entity3 's masterful 138 , was proven to be sub-par on a pristine batting pitch			1
@entity172 banked on patience instead of power batting , with the opener reluctant to take a risk following the dismissals of @entity0 ( 24 ) and @entity195 ( 41 )			2
but @entity199 , leading the pace attack in the absence of fellow left - armer @entity198 , was man of the match .			0
