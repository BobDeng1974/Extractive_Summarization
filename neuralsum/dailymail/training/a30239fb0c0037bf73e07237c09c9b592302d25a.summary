the wife of a man who flew from @entity2 to @entity3 to fight against @entity5 militants has pleaded for him to come home			1
@entity7 , 36 , travelled 3,500 miles to the war - torn country from his home in @entity11 in april this year			1
he originally told his wife , @entity12 , 44 , that he was going to help his father cross from northern @entity3 into @entity14 for medical help			1
the @entity17 shopkeeper promised her he would be back within a fortnight but instead stayed on to battle against @entity5 terrorists on the front line			2
@entity12 and @entity7 , pictured celebrating on @entity21 in 2009 , have not seen each other since he flew to @entity3 to fight against @entity5 @entity23 , six , is old enough to understand her father is at war and has told her mother and father that she wants him to come mr @entity7 later sent a message on the internet app @entity29 which said : ' i 'm with the @entity32 in northern @entity3			1
i 'm up in the mountains with them , helping to load their weapons			1
' terrified mrs @entity37 then spent five agonising months not knowing if her husband was dead or alive , before he finally made contact with her at the end of september			1
he promised he would be reunited with her and their six - year - old daughter , @entity23 , soon			1
but today mrs @entity37 said she had n't heard from her husband since that brief conversation and now spends every day worrying whether he will make it home			1
she said : ' he was going over to see his dad and was going to take him to get medical treatment			0
he said he would be there for two weeks			0
' back in april , the only brief message i had was that he was loading weapons and taking water up to the refugees in the hills			2
' after seeing the news i was terrified			2
i did n't know if he was dead or alive			0
' when i finally got in touch with him it was worse if anything because he was telling me that he was helping the @entity32 and that made me worry more			1
mr @entity7 , who was granted @entity2 citizenship in 2010 , told his wife and daughter , @entity23 ( left ) , that he was going to @entity3 to help his father cross the @entity14 border to receive medical help the @entity17 shopkeeper has only been in touch with her husband twice since he left to fight against @entity5 ' i spoke to him at the end of september on the internet and he said everything was going really bad and he planned on coming back as soon as he can			1
' i 've spent months hoping and praying my husband comes home			1
every day i 've tried to get in touch			2
i 'd ring his mobile but there was no answer			0
' the mobile signal over there is ludicrous and when they are bombing all the time it does n't help			0
' @entity7 told me it makes him cry with what is happening to innocent people			2
we just want him to come home safe to his family			2
' the couple met in @entity86 , @entity87 , nine years ago and got married in @entity88 in 2007			0
@entity12 , who can not work because of debilitating osteoarthritis , said @entity23 is old enough to realise her father is fighting in a deadly war			1
she added : ' it is getting very bad there , but @entity5 has not managed to enter @entity95			0
' there are thousands of refugees that have lost everything and he is trying to help			0
he is very kind - hearted			0
he told me he was taking water up the mountains to help the refugees			0
' before he went , @entity7 was always talking about people like @entity106 , saying they were giving the @entity17 community a bad name			0
he is fed - up with @entity17 getting a bad name , he thinks @entity110 are disgusting			0
' i 'm constantly worried about him but i have to put on a brave face for my little one			0
' she knows what 's going on and when we messaged him in september she said " can you come home , i do n't like all the shooting "			2
' he is very loyal to his country but we both love him and miss him very much			0
