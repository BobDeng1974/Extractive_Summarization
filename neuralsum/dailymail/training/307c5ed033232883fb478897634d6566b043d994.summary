by @entity0 in his first interview since 2011 , when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best - selling book @entity3 - author @entity4 has claimed that he did it because he was willing to ' kill himself ' to raise money for impoverished people			1
speaking to @entity9 's @entity8 for an interview that will air on tuesday , @entity4 , 56 , said that while he admitted to hearing the ' alarms ' over his 2006 work , he refused to acknowledge them in case they deflected from his goal of boosting his humanitarian projects			1
famously claiming that he had met @entity19 , although she had died three years previously , @entity4 begs for a second chance in the exclusive interview and claims that he has settled all the allegations he mis - spent money from his charity flying around the world in his own private jet			1
new beginning : @entity4 speaks with @entity9 's @entity27 and claims that he told falsehoods in his book because of his dramatic zeal to raise money for his humanitarian projects claiming in his interview with @entity8 that events did transpire in @entity3 as he wrote them - just not in the order he outlined them - @entity4 said that he ignored the warning signs in his own mind not to do this and promised not to repeat his mistakes			1
' it still just has puzzled me and why there was n't , at some point , in your mind , an alarm that went off and said , ' this just is n't right in some way , ' @entity8 asked in the interview			0
no more lies : @entity50 said that he is interested in the public granting him a second chance after the lies he told in his best selling memoir @entity3 ' there were alarms , @entity57 , ' @entity4 said			1
' i did n't listen to them			0
i was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects			1
' after its release in 2006 , @entity3 became a best seller and it , along with @entity4 's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years , resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the @entity68 - the charity he ran			1
@entity4 himself reaped financial benefits at the expense of the @entity68 , including the free promotion of @entity3 and his later book , @entity74			1
he also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies @entity68 bought to donate to libraries , schools , churches and military personnel , a 2012 report by the @entity76 said			0
after that investigation @entity4 was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $ 1million under a settlement agreement			1
@entity3 details how @entity4 resolved to build schools in @entity88 after he became lost and wandered into a poor @entity90 village , then follows him as he expands his school - building efforts there			1
the book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the @entity68 , which @entity4 founded in 1996 with a $ 1million donation from dr. @entity98 , a @entity99 physicist and mountaineer			1
charity : @entity4 with local businesswomen in @entity103 , in @entity90 - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people ther the books came under scrutiny in 2011 when reports by @entity110 and author @entity111 alleged that @entity4 fabricated parts of both and that he benefited financially from the charity			1
@entity4 is alleged to have made up stories about how he built the schools and one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held @entity19 's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000			2
@entity19 passed away in 1997 - the same week that princess @entity121 lost her life in car crash in @entity124			2
another claim , that he was kidnapped by @entity126 on a visit in july 1996 , was said to be untrue			0
also noted as questionable was mr @entity4 's account that he wandered lost into the village of @entity130 in @entity90 after trying to climb the world 's second - highest peak , @entity133 , then decided to build a school there			2
his previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into @entity130 , and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village			0
the 2006 book @entity3 , which sold millions of copies , was conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of his institute , founded by mr @entity4 in 1996 , and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations			1
@entity4 has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering , fraud , deceit , breach of contract and unjust enrichment			2
@entity153 , @entity90 : @entity4 from @entity154 , @entity155 the former executive director of the @entity68 , listens as newly arrived refugees from @entity158 tell their stories on break from making bricks however , in the aftermath of the @entity110 investigation @entity4 was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in @entity90 and @entity158 and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights , family vacations and luxury personal items			1
@entity4 's control of the @entity68 went largely unchallenged by its board of directors , which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him , the report prepared by the @entity155 attorney general 's office said			2
fabrications : @entity4 's 2006 book " @entity3 : one man 's @entity178 to promote peace ... one @entity182 " chronicled his failed attempt to climb @entity133 when an employee would question his practices , @entity4 either resisted or ignored the person			1
the result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for			0
itemized expenses listed as program - related were missing supporting receipts and documentation			0
employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to @entity68 credit cards			0
in 2012 , @entity4 was told he must reimburse the charity more than $ 1million under a settlement agreement - according to @entity155 's attorney general			1
the attorney general 's probe focused only on the charity 's finances and operations , and did not examine the books ' contents			0
the yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the @entity68 took in far more donations than it spent , and had $ 23million in reserves			0
the charity was judged to need better oversight so that too much control is not in one person 's hands , the audit found			0
‘ @entity222 's pursuits are noble and his achievements are important			0
however , serious internal problems in the management of @entity68 surfaced , ’ attorney general @entity219 said in the report			0
‘ despite the severity of their errors , @entity68 is worth saving			0
’ @entity4 was permanently removed as @entity68 's executive director in november , 2012			0
tragic : @entity231 ( right ) , who co-wrote the best - seller @entity3 with @entity4 ( left ) , about how @entity4 set up schools in @entity158 and @entity90 , has killed himself , aged 49 following the stresses and strains in the wake of the @entity110 piece , @entity4 had heart surgery			1
the investigation by @entity155 's attorney general also found that @entity68 spent $ 4.93million on advertising and promoting @entity4 's books , costs that the charity and the author had agreed to split but never did			2
@entity68 paid $ 2million in charter flights for @entity4 to keep his rigorous speaking engagement schedule before he started paying for his own travel in 2011			0
the investigation found that in many cases he was ‘ double - dipping , ’ where @entity68 paid for his travel to a speaking engagement and the host of the event also paid him a fee or honorarium for his travel , which @entity4 pocketed			2
scrutiny : the book follows the adventures of co-author @entity4 , pictured in @entity261 , northeastern @entity158 in 2009 , as he set up schools in @entity90 and @entity158 ' dishonest ' : but critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and @entity4 , left , later admitted some facts were wrong			1
@entity231 suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath @entity4 and his family also charged personal items to @entity68 in 2009 - 2010 amounting to $ 75,276 that included ‘ @entity271 clothing , @entity272 , luggage , luxurious accommodations and even vacations , ’ according to the report			2
the controversy became tragic in november of 2011 when co-author of @entity3 , @entity231 committed suicide			2
@entity231 suffered emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in the book			0
@entity4 , 52 , lives in @entity155 with his wife , a clinical psychologist , and their two young children			0
his biography describes him as ' a living hero to rural communities of @entity158 and @entity90 , where he has gained the trust of @entity293 leaders , military and militia commanders , government officials and tribal chiefs from his tireless effort to champion education , especially for girls			0

@entity4 has given his first interview since huge controversy over false claims in his best selling 2006 memoir @entity3
@entity4 asks for a second chance from the public - but denies he lied about events
claims that he simply changed the order in which they occurred in his life for dramatic effects
stated that his desire to raise money for charity was so strong that he was willing to put his life on the line
in the past @entity4 admitted there were ' *omissions* and *compressions* ' in book
