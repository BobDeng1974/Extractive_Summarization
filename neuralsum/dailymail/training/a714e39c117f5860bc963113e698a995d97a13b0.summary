by @entity0 published : 14:01 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 06:12 est , 13 january 2014 the pilots of @entity3 , a @entity5 search and rescue helicopter , could hear the screams of an expectant mother above their roaring engines as she gave birth in the back of their aircraft			1
the pair glanced at each other across their cockpit but did not dare look back into the helicopter ’s darkened cabin			1
there a team of airmen and a midwife were busy working by torchlight to deliver a baby boy			2
rescue 193 is the callsign given to the duty @entity5 that remains on 24 - hour standby at @entity26 in @entity27 ready to rescue people across south west @entity29			1
prepared : @entity30 on the ground at @entity26 , @entity27 , awaiting a call to attend an emergency drop : the squadron hovers above a boat during a training exercise on that particular october evening heavily pregnant @entity37 was being lifted to the @entity38 at @entity38 , near @entity39			1
@entity40 was born at 5lb 3oz around two miles south east of @entity39			2
his early arrival meant the helicopter landed with eight persons on board instead of the seven it took off with			1
despite the unusual drama , this was just one incident in a typically unpredictable shift for the crews of @entity50			1
the unit flies eight of the famous grey and red @entity55 helicopters based at @entity26 , where they stand guard over the rugged coastline and western approaches up to 200 miles out to sea			1
squadron boss commander @entity61 explains that his crews and helicopters are on constant standby to rush to the aid of those in distress			1
during the day they can scramble at 15 minutes ’ notice and at night within 45 minutes			1
' there are very few careers where on a daily basis you feel you have had such a positive effect , ’ he says			2
‘ there 's this incredible satisfaction for a job that has a quantifiable result			2
’ ready : petty officer @entity79 prepares to be winched from the @entity5 onto the deck of a passing vessel emergency response : observer lt commander @entity83 winches aboard the helicopter 's stretcher equipment : the team throw down a winch ready to bring the stretcher up from the boat 's deck the crucial role the squadron plays – whether rescuing sailors from stricken fishing vessels , searching for missing walkers or ferrying emergency cases to hospital – means that every year they conduct 300 or more rescues , frequently in extremely challenging weather			1
@entity61 says : ‘ aviation is very tightly controlled by regulation to keep everyone safe			2
but when everyone else is putting the aircraft into the hanger , we will be launching in conditions that are extremely testing			1
’ before sending his helicopter crews on leave this @entity114 , @entity112 reminded them of the role they had played in assisting hundreds of people , many of whom would be dead without the @entity118 ’s intervention			1
‘ i told the crews to think , as they sat down to eat their turkey dinners , that there would be 300 people going to be sat around with their families after rescues we had made , ’ @entity112 says			1
despite the festivities , the 60th year of the @entity118 ’s search and rescue service did not end quietly			2
helicopter crews were called into action more than two - dozen times as the foul weather lashed @entity132 almost non-stop during the festive season			1
history : for nearly half a century , the @entity50 , known as the @entity135 has saved thousands of people in life or death situations on the edge : two of the troops lean out of the door of the aircraft while they are stationed above the stranded boat view : the crew catches a glimpse of view cliffs as the @entity5 passes alongside the rugged @entity27 coast line during the holiday period flyers from @entity26 and @entity151 in @entity152 , @entity153 , saved or helped more than 20 fishermen , stranded walkers and medical cases			1
invited to witness the work of @entity158 for myself , the @entity118 offered to fly me on a search and rescue training mission			0
after a thorough briefing about the aims of the mission we ’re about to experience , it ’s off to the equipment room to be kitted out for flight over the sea			0
once encased in rubber immersion suit , leather gloves and boots and cumbersome helmet i ’m ready to go			0
soon we ’re walking across the concrete parking ramp to the waiting @entity5			0
our helicopter , number @entity176 , is the oldest @entity5 still in @entity132 military use			1
it is blasting out hot and smelly exhaust gases , vibrating under the power of its two @entity183 turbine engines , each producing more than 1,400 horse power			1
once aboard , the aircraft is cramped , noisy and the rear cabin where the observer and aircrewman work is dark , the only natural light coming from a giant side door which is latched open during winch operations			1
members of the crew talking continuously over the intercom between themselves and over the radio to air traffic controllers make it hard to follow out what ’s going on sometimes			0
inside the cockpit : the @entity5 is 1950s technology and @entity176 is the oldest in 771 fleet pilot : @entity204 , who is is on an exchange posting from the @entity206 , takes the controls during the practice operation as this is a live training mission , we are soon lifting off from @entity26 and heading out to see			1
soon we ’re hovering near a co-operative merchant ship which has agreed to allow a stretcher and crewman to be winched down onto its deck			0
petty officer @entity79 is lowered from the open door , the stretcher soon following behind him to demonstrate how casualties are rescued from ships at sea			0
@entity79 is no stranger to danger			0
he was the crewman on duty last november when a 21 metre @entity223 fishing boat , the @entity224 , started sinking and he had to pluck five sailors to safety			0
on this flight he is assisted by @entity228 , also a trained paramedic , who is there to assess @entity79 ’s performance			0
the aircraft commander is veteran observer lieutenant commander @entity83 , who will leave the @entity118 after more than 30 years when the @entity30 retire			1
he 's retraining to be a primary school teacher but describes his time on the @entity118 ’s search and rescue force as ‘ the best job i have ever done ’			0
once @entity79 is safely back aboard , the @entity5 flies to a nearby quarry where the crew show us how they can land the helicopter in tight spaces			1
treatment : @entity244 @entity228 and @entity79 practise medical techniques on a mannequin assistance : one of the crew members try their hand from the observer position as the winch prepares to pull the stretcher up next it ’s my turn to experience being dropped out on the winch line , which is no thicker than a pencil and can extend to 245 feet			0
@entity259 signals me to come forward to the door from my seat inside the helicopter			1
i ’m sitting with my legs dangling over the edge as we hover about 100 feet over the cliffs near the @entity267			0
the view down is not for those suffering from vertigo			0
@entity259 slips the winch over my shoulders and under my armpits and then i ’m pushed out of the door			0
the sensations are overwhelming as i swing just metres below the moving rotor blade , waves crashing below my feet			0
the winch whirrs and i ’m lowered down on the grass where @entity79 clips himself to the harness and the two of us are rapidly lifted back to the helicopter			1
the sight of the @entity5 ’s belly as we ’re raised from the cliffs is exactly what injured sailors would see as the @entity118 arrives to help them			0
back onboard : two of the crew members are winched up onto the helicopter , pictured left is petty officer @entity79 view from below : a crew member holds on to the winch as he leans out of the helicopter it ’s a relief to be safely back inside the warm aircraft			1
i can only imagine how comforting it must be to be helped aboard in a real emergency by these real - life heroes			1
if the glamorous end of naval aviation is reserved for the aircrews , the engineers fulfil a vital role			0
without them , none of the @entity30 would ever get airborne and the pilots would be stuck on the ground			2
@entity50 ’s engineering officer lt cdr @entity313 , who has 130 engineers and technicians working for him , explains that the @entity30 are 1950s technology but have been constantly upgraded			0
@entity313 , who joined the @entity118 having been sponsored through university , says : ‘ it now takes longer and longer to maintain			0
it takes 30 man hours to achieve one flying hour			2
aircraft need servicing after every flight and lots of maintenance			2
' all of the airframes are older than me			0
most have more than 10,000 hours of flying time – more than a year aloft			0
the whole @entity5 fleet here has 1.54m flying hours and still have 64,000 hours to go until retirement			0
' waiting : the squadron are perched mid-flight as they make their way to a vessel during the training exercise on time : lieutenant commander @entity338 checks his watch as he briefs the crew on board @entity30 have been flying since 1969 and @entity313 reckons that every day they are asked to do things that are more demanding than a @entity344 car			2
‘ it is the equivalent of three or four @entity344 races every day , ’ he says			2
like the ageing @entity30 , @entity118 search and rescue is coming to the end of its life			0
by 2017 a @entity353 - owned company , @entity352 , will take up the mantle having won a £ 1.6bn outsourcing contract designed to modernise the operation and introduce a fleet of new aircraft			1
although the decision has attracted some public controversy , there is no sign of bitterness among the crews on 771 @entity50			2
commander @entity61 admits that any reduction in the military ’s role is ‘ not something you would necessarily welcome ’			0
but he explains that some of his men and women will transfer to the new venture , while others like @entity83 will leave the @entity118			0
regardless of what the crews on 771 do next , they will move on with a lasting memories of the 10 - tonnes sea king			1
‘ there is a lot of affection for the @entity5 because for a lot of us it is the aircraft we learned to fly and fight in , ’ @entity112 says			2
‘ this is where i cut my teeth			0
’ forward planning : petty officer @entity79 ( left ) and veteran sea king observer lt commander @entity83 breif the crew ahead of the training mission in flight : observer lt commander @entity83 , the commander of @entity176			0

the pilots of @entity3 can be scrambled in 15 minutes during the day and are on 24 - hour standby
unit flies eight @entity55 helicopters based at @entity26 , @entity27 , guarding the rugged coastline
aircraft uses two @entity183 turbine engines , each producing more than 1,400 horse power
helicopter crews were called into action more than two - dozen times during the stormy weather over the festive period
