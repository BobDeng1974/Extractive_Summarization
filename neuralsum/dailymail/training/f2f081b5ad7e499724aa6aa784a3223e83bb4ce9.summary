while the restaurant 's sign stands as an example of the hateful sentiment that the event evoked in some @entity4 , many others have sent messages of solidarity by offering to accompany @entity12 on public transport with the hashtag # @entity178 , in an attempt dispel fears of @entity182 attacks .			1
