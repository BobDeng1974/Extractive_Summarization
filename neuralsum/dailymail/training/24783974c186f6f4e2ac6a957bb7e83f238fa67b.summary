rising global temperatures , rather than human hunters , were the main reason woolly mammoths became extinct , scientists claim			0
thousands of years before modern humans left @entity7 , they say , climate change drove mammoths to the brink of extinction			2
warmer weather caused their numbers to plummet as their grassy habitat was destroyed			0
the woolly mammoth was driven to extinction by warmer weather , according to new research			2
genetic analyses reveals the iconic beast of the @entity19 was strongly affected by past changes in climate @entity23 and @entity24 scientists carried out genetic analysis on scores of remains discovered across northern @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
they found that global warming 120,000 years ago caused the mammoth population to fall from several million to just tens of thousands , living in small pockets around the world			1
the following @entity19 allowed their numbers to recover , however , and in @entity28 a distinct sub-group evolved from the survivors , flourishing for millennia before dying out around 30,000 years ago			2
then , 10,000 years ago , the onset of the latest warm period – which is still going on – spelled doom for the remaining populations of the giant mammal , which was unable to adapt			1
‘ we found that a previous warm period some 120,000 years ago caused populations to decline and become fragmented , in line with what we would expect for cold - adapted species such as the woolly mammoth , ’ said lead author @entity42 , from the @entity43			1
the study , published in the journal @entity51 , involved dna sequencing of a large number of mammoth remains found across northern @entity56 and @entity30 the research , published in the @entity51 , challenges long - held views that mammoths were resilient and thrived in the warmer climate			1
in fact , scientists said , they were at risk whenever temperatures rose – and it is very likely that climate change was the main reason they died out , with hunting by humans a less important factor			0
by looking at differences in dna samples and tracing migration patterns , scientists were able to establish that the mammoth population plummeted , then recovered , before the species became extinct			0
the findings suggest mammoths were isolated to small areas of good habitat in a warm spell 120,000 years ago , before numbers bounced back during the following @entity19			1
but the latest warm period finally signalled the end for the mammoth			1
researchers said that as the @entity87 heated up again , mammoths were once more confined to smaller and smaller areas suitable for them to graze			0
‘ this process culminated with a severe decline in population size that started when temperatures began to increase at the end of the last @entity19 , ’ said dr @entity89 , a researcher from @entity90			0
‘ this suggests that spells of warm climate made the mammoth more susceptible to extinction , ’ said dr @entity96 from the @entity43			1
the study showed mammoth populations became highly dynamic during the second half of the last @entity19 where some expanded and others - such as the @entity28 variety - disappeared to understand why the species as a whole became extinct , scientists said they would have to examine the last outposts where mammoths survived , such as remote @entity112 in @entity113 and @entity114 off the coast of @entity116			0
the study concluded : ‘ it thus seems likely that environmental changes played a significant role in shaping the woolly mammoth ’s demographic history , with warm periods restricting the amount of available habitat and cold periods leading to population expansions , both owing to increases in the amount of steppe – tundra and through sea level - driven exposure of the @entity133			2
’ woolly mammoths could roam @entity87 again , according to one eminent scientist who believes frozen dna from newly discovered frozen mammoths could be the key to the species ' resurrection			0
stem cell scientist sir @entity143 who is best known for cloning the world 's first mammal , @entity141 the sheep , thinks modern techniques could be used to create a replica of the prehistoric animal			0
the source of viable mammoth cells could come from a number of frozen bodies discovered in the @entity116 permafrost in recent years			0
here you can see frozen tissue and blood the giant beasts lived in the late @entity159 period , tens of thousands of years ago			2
their numbers were thought to have fallen across @entity30 and on mainland @entity56 around 10,000 years ago , probably as a result of hunting by our ancestors as well as a changing climate .			1

tests were done on remains found in northern @entity56 and @entity30
they revealed population declines during a warm period 120,00 years ago
suggests a warm climate made mammoth more susceptible to extinction
