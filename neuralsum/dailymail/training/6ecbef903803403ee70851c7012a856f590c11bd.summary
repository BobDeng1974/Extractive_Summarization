by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 12:02 est , 20 august 2013 obese people never feel full after eating due to a ' misfiring ' hormone , a study says			1
pancreatic cells ( pictured ) secrete glucagon and other hormones obese people never feel full after eating due to a ' misfiring ' hormone , according to a new study			1
researchers found glucagon , a hormone involved in regulating appetite , loses its ability to help obese people feel full after a meal , but it continues to suppress hunger pangs in people with type 1 diabetes			1
the primary role of glucagon , which is secreted by the pancreas , is to signal the body to release stored glucose when blood sugar falls too low			2
but growing evidence suggests the hormone may also play a role in controlling food intake and feelings of fullness , or satiation , through signalling the body to reduce levels of other appetite hormones such as ghrelin			1
the study 's lead author , dr @entity36 of @entity38 in @entity39 , said : ' once a person becomes obese , glucagon no longer induces feelings of fullness			1
' further research is needed to determine why glucagon no longer suppresses appetite effectively in this population , even though they are otherwise healthy			2
' the study , published in the @entity47 , investigated glucagon levels and appetite among 11 obese people , 13 of whom had type 1 diabetes and 13 lean people who received injections of either glucagon or a placebo			1
the researchers then measured their appetites using a satiety scale as well as levels of the appetite hormone ghrelin			2
feelings of fullness did not differ between obese study participants who received glucagon injections and those who were given the placebo			2
growing evidence suggests glucagon may also play a role in controlling food intake and feelings of fullness , or satiation , through signalling the body to reduce levels of other appetite hormones such as ghrelin in comparison , participants who were lean or had type 1 diabetes reported feeling significantly more full after receiving glucagon			1
the response to the hormone was detectable in this population , even 24 hours after it was administered			0
dr @entity36 said : ' the findings could influence efforts to develop new treatments for obesity and diabetes			1
' although therapeutic agents that influence glucagon and other hormones currently are considered a promising avenue for research , this study suggests a treatment involving glucagon may be ineffective in controlling meal size in people who are obese			1
' @entity99 is a hormone that is produced by cells in a part of the pancreas known as the islets of @entity105			0
the hormone plays an active role in allowing the body to regulate the utilisation of glucose and fats			0
@entity99 is released in response to low blood glucose levels and when the body needs additional glucose , such as after vigorous exercise			0
when glucagon is released it stimulates the liver to break down glycogen to be released into the blood as glucose , activates gluconeogenesis , ( the conversion of amino acids into glucose ) and breaks down stored fat into fatty acids for use as fuel by cells			0
@entity99 serves to keep blood glucose levels high enough for the body to function well			0
when blood glucose levels are low , glucagon is released and signals the liver to release glucose into the blood			0
the hormone is secreted in response to meals varies and the amount varies depending on the food eaten			0
in response to a carbohydrate - heavy meal , glucagon levels in the blood fall to stop blood glucose levels soaring			0
however , is a person eats a meal rich in protein , glucagon levels in the blood increase			0
in people with diabetes , the presence of glucagon can push blood glucose levels too high because wither not enough insulin is present or in the case of type 2 diabetes , the body is not very good at responding to insulin .			2

research by @entity38 could influence efforts to develop new treatments for obesity and diabetes
