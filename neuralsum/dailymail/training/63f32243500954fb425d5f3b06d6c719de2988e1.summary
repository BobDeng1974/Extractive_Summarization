her distraught father , broke down as he told the court : ' the doctor said to her ‘ did you meet someone on holiday ? are you missing him ? ' she found it very distressing he was suggesting she was lovesick for a boy			1

but he denied telling her family her illness was ' all in her head			1
' dr @entity1 said : ' there was never any discussion about tb or sign of @entity46			1
it did not match her symptoms			2
i fully accept @entity46 did not cross my mind			1
' ' every time she [ @entity4 ] came to see me she walked into the surgery unaided and she never looked unwell			2
i would not have recorded her condition as ‘ normal ’ if she had not seemed so			0

the long - serving doctor , who heads the @entity125 practice , also attempted to offer his condolences to @entity4 's family , prompting them to walk out of the courtroom			0
another gp at the @entity125 surgery , dr @entity130 , told the coroner he believed @entity4 did not have active tb when he assessed her on four dates in september and october 2010			0

' i do n't think she had active tb at the time , ' the doctor said			0
' none of the symptoms were suggesting that she had tb			0

@entity4 ’s weight plummeted and at one point she was so ill she could only tolerate baby food			0
after doctors at @entity198 and @entity199 hospitals did not detect @entity46 , @entity4 was admitted to @entity200 where she stayed for five days			1
