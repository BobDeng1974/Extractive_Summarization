click here for @entity2 's @entity1 unless @entity4 is someone who engages in lengthy conversations with himself , it really should not take long to now determine the future of @entity7			1
@entity4 is the chief executive of both @entity8 and @entity9 after all , and here again was further evidence of why he simply needs to send an email to his own inbox stating that @entity7 is staying put			1
he can dress it up however he wants			0
express a bit of regret even			0
but he needs to be firm and he needs to be decisive			0
@entity17 certainly wants the 36 - year - old midfielder to stick around , and no wonder when he continues to produce important goals with such frequency			0
@entity7 scores the opener to put @entity8 1 - 0 up against struggling @entity24 club @entity23 @entity7 put @entity8 1 - 0 up to match @entity26 's all - time record in the @entity24 of 175 goals @entity7 runs away in celebration after giving @entity8 the lead at the @entity30 on saturday @entity7 yet again came up good for @entity8 as he gave them the lead in the 40th minute city players celebrate going 1 - 0 up against @entity23 thanks to @entity7 's goal in the 40th minute at the @entity30 @entity23 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity34 6.5 , @entity35 5.5 , @entity36 5.5 , @entity37 6 , @entity38 6.5 , @entity39 6 , @entity40 5.5 , @entity41 6.5 , @entity42 5.5 ( @entity43 , 79 ) , @entity44 6.5 ( @entity45 5.5 , 64 ) , @entity46 6 ( @entity47 5.5 , 73 ) subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 manager : @entity54 6.5 bookings : none goals : none @entity8 : @entity58 6 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 6.5 ( @entity61 , 77 ) , @entity62 6 , @entity63 6 , @entity64 6.5 , @entity7 6.5 ( @entity65 6.5 , 60 ) , @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 7 , @entity68 6 , @entity69 5.5 ( @entity70 5.5 , 74 ) subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 manager : @entity17 7 bookings : @entity66 , @entity58 goals : @entity7 ( 40 ) referee : @entity79 ( @entity80 ) 6.5 attendance : 31,643 how the @entity24 table now looks how @entity7 scored his opener ... click here for more from our @entity1 @entity7 is a phenomenon , and not just because that is now six goals in his short time at the @entity89			1
more staggering is the fact that a midfielder now stands shoulder - to - shoulder with the finest striker we have seen in the @entity24 , @entity7 ’s 175 goals putting him level with @entity26 and fourth only to @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
here at the @entity30 he proved himself every inch the predator he has long been , timing his arrival perfectly to meet @entity66 ’s pass with a delightful close - range 40th minute finish			1
tired after their efforts in @entity106 in midweek and weakened by the loss of @entity109 to injury during the pre-match warm - up , @entity8 were struggling to attack a spirited @entity23 side with any real conviction			1
but @entity66 showed great skill and composure with a dribble into the box before delivering the ball to perfection to an unmarked @entity7			1
@entity54 would been annoyed with his defenders			0
hell he might even have cursed			0
but it was an intelligent piece of attacking football from two terrific players			0
@entity23 fans unveiled a banner showing their support for manager @entity54 on saturday following his controversies @entity23 manager @entity54 sits in the stand as per where he feels he gets a better tactical point of view for matches @entity58 ( left ) looks to save an early shot from @entity23 's @entity46 ( right ) while defender @entity62 tries to stop him @entity46 of @entity23 looks to test @entity8 early on with a shot while @entity62 ( right ) pressures him city goalkeeper @entity58 was being tested early on by the club sitting bottom of the @entity24 on saturday @entity8 goalkeeper @entity58 pictured early on during the @entity24 match on saturday against @entity23 @entity141 knows how they respond over in @entity9			1
presumably with a bit of a groan together with the realisation that they might have to be patient if they ever want to see @entity7 marshalling their midfield			1
about as patient as @entity23 supporters might have to be before they see their team win again			0
not since that remarkable 5 - 3 defeat of @entity155 back in september has it happened , defeat here extending a miserable run to just two points from a possible 33			0
a run that increases the pressure on a beleaguered @entity54			0
they actually played well in spells , starting so impressively – @entity39 was excellent - the statisticians began to wonder if @entity165 might be about to beat the @entity167 champions for the first time since 1972 ; when @entity170 ’s hat - trick conquered @entity172 ’s @entity171			0
but such romanticism again gave way to realism , and with yet another reminder of the size of the task facing this club to remain in the top flight			2
this was a good day to play @entity8			1
they might have been strengthened by the return of @entity60 , @entity68 and @entity67 but @entity109 ’s injury in the warm - up forced @entity17 to employ a relative novice in attack and the loss of @entity60 to injury before the end presented further problems			1
it was certainly a difficult day for 18 - year - old @entity69 , making his first @entity24 start as a replacement for @entity109			1
the setback for @entity8 certainly seemed to give @entity23 some much needed confidence , because they started brightly here			2
@entity46 proved a handful for @entity155 when they were beaten here earlier this season and his pace left @entity8 ’s back four looking stretched at times too			2
@entity62 , impressive here , did particularly well to deny the rapidly advancing @entity23 forward with a perfectly executed block			0
@entity23 can be too cavalier			0
it probably explains why only @entity203 had conceded more goals than them in the top flight this season coming into this game			0
but their early ambition was admirable , with @entity60 forced to be at his physical , combative best to deal with @entity44 at one stage			2
@entity68 was back fit for @entity8 , though they remain without striker @entity209 who suffered knee ligament damage @entity23 lost 5 - 3 at home against @entity8 on saturday , having beaten their @entity155 rivals by the same scoreline previously @entity37 of @entity23 and @entity59 of @entity8 battle for the ball during the @entity24 match on saturday @entity7 acknowledges manager @entity17 as he goes off in the second half after giving them the lead at the @entity30 @entity41 went dangerously close with a free - kick , which was all the more worrying for @entity17 when his forwards were struggling to impose themselves anything like as effectively			1
it was @entity23 displaying the energy and determination			0
@entity23 who could sense weakness in their opponents			0
fatigue in the wake of their midweek efforts in @entity106 was clearly a factor , and perhaps explained why two players not involved in that stunning @entity234 triumph finally mustered a response for the visitors			2
a neat ball from @entity68 was met with a decent shot from @entity67			0
sadly for @entity8 it was superseded by the save from @entity34 , in goal for the injured @entity242			1
there was nothing @entity34 could do , however , about @entity7 ’s 40th minute goal ; a goal that owed much to the fine attacking play of @entity66 but still demanded a calm , clever finish			2
@entity60 down injured in what could be a serious blow to @entity8 @entity60 applauds fans are he walks off injured during the @entity24 match on saturday @entity60 was forced off with an injury during the second half against @entity23 after the break and @entity23 remained determined , even if the sight of @entity54 barking instructions from his position in the stand to his staff down on the bench suggested he was less than happy			1
probably with a lack of composure in that all - important final third			0
@entity17 , meanwhile , began to make changes			0
shortly before the hour @entity7 walked off to a chorus of ‘ super @entity268 ’ from the visiting fans – they seem to have adopted the song as well as the player – but the loss of @entity60 to what looked like a hamstring problem would have been more worrying for @entity8 ’s manager			1
it provided further inspiration for @entity23 , @entity8 now without their captain ; their defensive rock			2
at one stage @entity58 was booked for timewasting , such was the level of concern in trying to hold onto their single goal lead			2
a lead secured by the evergreen , irrepressible @entity7			1
@entity58 celebrates after securing the win against @entity23 , having been booked for time - wasting earlier in the game @entity66 applauds the travelling fans after @entity8 claimed a good win to remain within three points of leaders @entity292 here 's how @entity67 fared at the @entity30			1

@entity7 gave @entity8 the lead after 40 minutes at the @entity30
it was @entity7 's 175th of his @entity24 *career* to put the former @entity292 star level with @entity26
@entity8 were without injured striker @entity209 who has suffered knee ligament damage
the visitors lost @entity60 *due* to injury after 74 minutes
