author ] published : 16:12 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 16:12 est , 29 march 2013 @entity1 plays @entity2 when it comes to wooing women , the doctor might do well to take a leaf out of @entity8 's book			1
while the lovestruck @entity9 struggles to develop a deeper relationship with his new travelling companion @entity2 in the new series that starts this week after locking lips with her in the @entity15 , @entity8 won over the actress who plays her with a simple blend of kindness and enthusiasm			1
or , as the actress who plays @entity2 , @entity1 , puts it , ' he totally blew me away			1
i 'd worked on all these carefully prepared ideas and accents for my audition , but everything just went out of the window when @entity8 started to talk and move around in the rehearsal room			1
he was like a hurricane , full of fantastic ideas and spontaneity			0
he started playing different characters i could bounce off and made me feel as if he were auditioning himself , he got so into it			0
' i remember thinking how fantastic it would be if i actually got the part , how great it would be working with @entity38 and that 's exactly what 's happened			2
@entity8 's the perfect leading man and sets such a lovely tone on set , making the atmosphere wonderful			1
there 's really not much more you could ask for in your co-star			2
' in typical @entity50 fashion , @entity1 's introduction to the series has been anything but straightforward			2
she made her debut in an episode last september , playing a character called @entity2 who was trapped inside a dalek			1
then she reappeared in last year 's @entity15 special as @entity2 , a @entity58 barmaid who met an unfortunate end			1
her ' third entrance ' , as she calls it , sees her playing @entity2 in the present day , now a governess in a @entity63 suburb to two children who 've lost their mother			1
' she meets the doctor when he turns up on her doorstep dressed as a monk , so that 's her first impression and i had to treat it as a completely clean slate			2
but this is the @entity2 , or at least the essence of her , that you 'll see from now on , ' says @entity1 , ' for the rest of the current series and into the next one too			1
and after that ? who knows ... ' @entity8 and @entity1 - @entity79 look set to hike up the on - screen chemistry in the new series of dr who the big question , of course , is how far their fledgling romance that began with that @entity15 kiss will go			1
@entity1 's not about to spoil it for the fans ( although she does refer to the @entity91 as ' a kissing booth ' in this week 's episode ) , but reveals @entity8 was keen to stoke up some chemistry between them			1
once she 'd landed the part , he suggested she watch some classic @entity98 and @entity99 movies such as @entity100 and without love that made much of the sexual frisson between the two actors			2
' he thought they 'd be useful in understanding the rhythm and pace of a relationship between a male and female lead , and they were			0
he also suggested i watch some @entity112 films - which i 'd never seen before - because the main character 's always accompanied by various women on his adventures			2
' @entity98 and @entity99 famously had an off - screen affair , but that wo n't be happening with @entity1 and @entity38 the lantern - jawed actor may have recently revealed he 's single again after his on / off romance with model @entity121 ended and he has n't been slow in paying @entity1 compliments , describing her as ' hot ' and ' stunning - looking on screen '			2
@entity50 with @entity1 as @entity2 and @entity8 as the doctor in the @entity15 special but @entity1 's been in a relationship with @entity130 star @entity129 for the past couple of years , and when the cameras are n't rolling she and @entity8 seem more like conspiratorial friends than anything else , a couple of mates enjoying being involved in one of tv 's most popular shows			1
they take particular delight in welcoming guest stars to @entity141 , the studios in @entity143 where the show is filmed			0
@entity8 's introduced @entity1 to a game called @entity146 , where he greets a guest on their first day on set with what might be deemed an over-familiar display of affection - a hand on the arm , shoulder , perhaps even bottom , just to gauge their reaction			1
this kept @entity8 and @entity159 , the doctor 's former assistant @entity159 , amused for hours			1
some people though , reveals @entity1 , are exempt			0
' there were no liberties taken with @entity164 when she turned up for an episode later in the series , @entity8 and i just watched her from afar , fascinated by the dynamic between her and her daughter @entity169 , who also plays her daughter on the show			2
' @entity1 says filming dr who is always enjoyable , ' even when it 's soggy ' rubbing shoulders with dames was the last thing on her mind when @entity179 - born @entity1 , now 26 , began her career as @entity182 's @entity181 , a part she landed at the age of 19 and continued in for almost five years			2
after a stint on @entity192 drama @entity190 , the role of cheeky @entity187 maid @entity186 in @entity188 brought her to a wider audience			0
but it 's @entity50 , with its loyal fans ( ' although i can honestly say i have n't received a single love letter or marriage proposal since i joined , ' says @entity1 ) and the almost iconic status his assistants assume , that will cement her in the nation 's consciousness			0
after a pretty gruelling schedule she 's now putting the finishing touches to the current series before taking a well - earned rest this summer while @entity8 travels to @entity209 to film his role in the @entity212 movie how to catch a monster			1
then it 'll be back to work for the star - studded 50th anniversary special , which is rumoured to have lots of old doctors on board and due to be shown in november			0
' it 's been tough at times , ' admits @entity1			0
' the third episode in this current run , called @entity224 , is set on board a @entity227 submarine and marks the return of the classic @entity50 monsters the @entity229			0
before every take in that episode they 'd come and spray us with water , so we were soaking wet for two weeks			0
' but @entity50 is always hugely enjoyable , even when it 's soggy			0
there 's a scene in tonight 's first episode where the doctor comes revving out of the @entity91 on a motorcycle and he and @entity2 travel across @entity63			1
i 'm sitting there with my hands around @entity8 's middle , riding across @entity246 on a motorbike with the @entity248 in the background and thinking , " this is fun , this is really good fun			1
" ' @entity1 with @entity250 in @entity182 in 2006 the most difficult thing about the job , she says , is trying to keep the vow of secrecy that 's a prerequisite for anyone involved with the show - something @entity1 got an early taste of when she first went for the part and was forced to throw friends and family off the scent by telling them she was auditioning for a tv comedy in @entity143			0
' i 've had to learn to say a lot - because there 's so much interest in @entity50 - without giving anything away			0
it 's the nature of the programme			0
it 's based on surprises and reveals , so the last thing you want to do is give away anything that might spoil it for the viewers			0
' all i can say is that the doctor sees @entity2 as a work in progress and a subject of both endless fascination - and frustration too , ' she says			2
' there 's nothing the doctor hates more than an unsolved mystery and @entity2 is exactly that			1
he wo n't stop until he finds out the truth about her			0
and that could take a while			0
' @entity50 , tonight , 6.15pm , @entity192 .			0
