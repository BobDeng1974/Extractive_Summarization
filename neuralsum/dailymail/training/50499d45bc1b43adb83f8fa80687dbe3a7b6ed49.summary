by @entity1 reporter almost 25 years ago , @entity2 's arrived in the @entity3 and delighted @entity4 with their first taste of @entity7 fast - food culture - but now the company is the subject of a lawsuit that that could ban it from selling some of its signature products			1
the company is being taken to court by the @entity4 consumer protection agency for selling foods that contain more fats and carbohydrates than are allowed by national regulations			1
the lawsuit can not come at a more difficult time as relations between the @entity7 and @entity4 worsen as a result of the @entity25 crisis			2
although there 's no demonstrable connection between the @entity2 's suit and the tensions , the consumer protection agency , @entity51 , has a history of actions that appear to dovetail @entity4 's political agenda			1
as tensions between @entity4 and @entity60 escalated before their 2008 war , @entity4 banned the import of @entity60 wine and mineral water — two of its major export products — for failing to meet sanitary norms			1
last year , as tensions heated up over @entity25 's desire to sign a trade pact with the @entity70 , @entity4 banned imports of chocolates made by the company of @entity74 , a tycoon who supported the @entity70 deal and is now @entity25 's president			1
@entity77 said on its website that it brought the case after inspections of two of the company 's restaurants in @entity84			0
according to the statement , some food was found with microbial contamination and several items had caloric values two to three times higher than allowed by national regulations			0
fast food : @entity2 's said in a statement it had not received any complaint from the agency and had no information about the lawsuit			2
it said its food was produced according to methods approved by @entity4 authorities products that were mentioned for incorrect nutritional information were cheeseburgers , @entity106 — the local equivalent of the @entity108 — fish sandwiches and several milkshake varieties			1
the suits asks that sale of @entity2 's products that do not meet the regulations be declared illegal , but it was not clear what penalty the company could face			0
the two restaurants in @entity84 were to be fined 70,000 rubles ( $ 2,100 )			0
@entity2 's prompted the ire of @entity4 nationalists earlier this year after it closed its outlets in @entity49			0
the animosity is a far cry from the fascination that @entity31 had for @entity2 's when it opened its first outlet in the @entity3 in 1990 ; customers waited in hours - long lines to experience the efficient service and reliable availability of items — rare novelties in the @entity3 era			0
after the collapse of the @entity3 in 1991 , other @entity7 and @entity134 chains staked out their own territory			0
@entity4 malls now have food courts virtually identical to @entity7 's , except that @entity139 , @entity140 and other familiar names are written in @entity142 .			2

it could ban the production and sale of ice cream , milkshakes , cheeseburgers , @entity155 and *chicken* sandwiches
food imports often fall victim to *geopolitical* tensions in @entity4
in the past cheese , wines and other regional *delicacies* from its *post-soviet* *neighbors* have been banned when political relations *soured*
