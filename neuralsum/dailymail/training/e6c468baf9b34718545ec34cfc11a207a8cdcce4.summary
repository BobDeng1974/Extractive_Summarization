a spooky snail with a transparent shell has been discovered within @entity3 's deepest cave			1
the tiny creature has been declared a news species and lives in one of the 20 deepest cave systems in the world ; @entity10 – @entity11 in @entity3			1
the newly discovered species - @entity12 - belongs to a genus of minute air - breathing land snails that can not see to find their way around and are considered to be true eutroglobionts that only live in dark , underground caves			1
a spooky snail with a transparent shell has been discovered within @entity3 's deepest cave			2
it can not see and is thought to only live in dark , underground caves the fragile snail has a beautifully shaped dome - like translucent shell			0
scientists from @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30 in @entity3 , found just one living specimen during the expedition , the findings of which were published in the journal @entity34			2
the animal was found at the remarkable depth of 980 metres , in an unnamed chamber full of rocks and sand with a small stream running through it			0
the newly discovered species - @entity12 - belongs to a genus of minute air - breathing land snails			1
here you can see its incredible transparent shell and body all known species from the cave - dwelling genus @entity47 possess a limited ability to move			0
their preference of a muddy habitat and the fact that they are usually located near the drainage system of the cave , in a close proximity to running water , suggests these animals are not immobile			0
scientists think that dispersal is achieved by snails travelling via water or hitching a ride on larger mammals			0
this is a 3 - d model of the @entity10 - @entity11 cave system in @entity3 that shows where snail shells were collected as well as where the living creature was found the @entity10 – @entity11 is the deepest cave system in @entity3 and is known for its extraordinary vertical shape , long pits and great depth of minus 1,392 metres			1
from an ecological point of view this cave system is extremely interesting for having three microclimatic layers : an icy part that forms its entrance with a temperature of about 1 ° c , a middle part with temperatures up to 2 ° c and bottom part with a temperature of 4 ° @entity81 these unusual living conditions make the cave extremely interesting for scientists from a biodiversity point of view .			0

scientists from @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30 in @entity3 discovered the rare transparent *mollusc*
the species @entity12 belongs to a genus of minute air - breathing land snails that are solely found in dark , underground caves
it was discovered in one of the 20 deepest cave systems in the world ; @entity10 – @entity11 in @entity3
