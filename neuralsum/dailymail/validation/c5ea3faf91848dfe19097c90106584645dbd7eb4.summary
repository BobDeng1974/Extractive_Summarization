emails @entity0 turned over to a @entity3 committee investigating the 2012 attack on a @entity6 compound in @entity7 , @entity8 , show her aides sometimes used their personal email accounts to communicate with her through her own private account			1
@entity12 said during a march 10 press conference that ' the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses			1
' that , she claimed then , ' meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the @entity22 ' for archiving , where they would turn up in searches conducted in response to @entity28 requests			2
but the @entity29 reported on monday that some of the approximately 300 @entity12 emails examined by a congressional committee suggest otherwise			0
former secretary of state @entity0 could be waving goodbye to her presidential ambitions if ' email-gate ' gets deeper			0
she spoke at an event hosted by the @entity36 on monday lost to history ? former @entity22 deputy chief of staff for @entity38 ( right ) was one of her closest aides , and emailed @entity12 in a conversation where both women used personal accounts the address : @entity38 had an email address on the former secretary of state 's private server , judging from records maintained by @entity49 the emails from @entity12 , a presumptive @entity51 presidential candidate , do not prove the former secretary of state ordered a ' stand down , ' stopping @entity6 forces from responding to the @entity7 attack or participated in a related cover - up , the newspaper reported , citing four senior government officials			1
but they do raise new questions about how much of @entity12 's correspondence has been lost to history			2
federal record retention laws are designed to prevent the kind of archive side - stepping @entity12 is accused of carrying on for the four years she led the @entity22			2
@entity66 subpoenaed email records last week from ' close to a dozen ' people who worked for @entity0 at @entity69			0
the @entity29 report is the latest revelation in the saga over @entity12 and her use of a personal email address to conduct government business , as well as a private computer server to store that correspondence			2
@entity79 : @entity12 has been dogged by allegations that she purposely hid incriminating emails from the @entity22 – and from public records requesters – by keeping all her emails on a private server @entity12 spokesman @entity86 told the @entity29 that @entity12 's aides primarily used their work email to correspond with her about government matters , adding that ' only the tiniest fraction of the more than 1 million emails they sent or received involved their personal accounts			1
' according to the @entity29 , she occasionally exchanged emails with at least four aides via personal accounts while she was at the @entity22 , including her foreign policy adviser , @entity99 ; chief of staff , @entity101 ; senior adviser , @entity103 ; and her personal aide , @entity105			2
@entity38 used an email address on @entity12 's private server in addition to her official ' dot - gov ' address			1
@entity101 reportedly did the same			0
@entity12 has confirmed that she exclusively used her private account , calling it a matter of ' convenience			0
' in one email exchange cited by the @entity29 , she asked an aide to assess the performance of a top state official before @entity66			0
' did we survive the day ? ' she wrote			0
' survive , yes , ' the adviser responded			0
@entity120 ? it 's not clear what @entity12 's inner circle said to her about her turn before the @entity6 @entity126 – the infamous ' what difference does it make ? ' moment – because the former secretary 's emails were outside the @entity22 's archive system in separate exchanges weeks later , @entity99 wrote @entity12 to reassure her that she would n't be held to account in the same way as then - @entity136 ambassador @entity135 , who falsely claimed on national television that the death and destruction in @entity7 was the consequence of a protest that spiraled out of control			1
' she did make clear our view that this started spontaneously then evolved , ' he wrote to @entity12 at one point , seeming to reinforce the idea that the @entity150 administration planned to stick with that assessment			0
. later , when the @entity3 began referring to @entity7 as a ' terror attack , ' @entity99 told @entity12 that in her own publiccomments she had steered clear of the nettles that had snared @entity155			1
' you never said ‘ spontaneous ’ or characterized their motivations , ' he wrote , according to the @entity29			0
details on conversations like these are sketchy : the @entity29 was n't permitted to look at the emails , but relied on descriptions from four different sources			0
could it be ? housing secretary @entity165 ( right ) has been talked about as a potential presidential candidate and would catch momentum if @entity0 's email scandal derailed her campaign hopes probe : @entity171 @entity170 rep. @entity170 chairs a special congressional committee looking into the @entity7 attacks , and has subpoenaed emails from ' close to a dozen ' current and past @entity12 aides @entity101 ( left ) was @entity12 's chief of staff at the @entity22 and reportedly used an off - the - books email address to trade messages with the then - secretary of state , potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators because i 'm happy ? @entity12 is her party 's presumed presidential front - runner , having come in second to @entity150 in 2008 a spokesman for the @entity187 - controlled @entity186 on @entity7 declined to comment , according to the newspaper			1
@entity12 has said she gave copies of all work - related emails to the @entity22 , but @entity187 , who see her as their top target in the run - up to the 2016 election , continued to press for more records			1
last week @entity187 asked the @entity22 to hand over numerous documents related to @entity12 's use of private email while she was secretary of state and have called on her to hand over her email server to a third party			1
@entity170 , the @entity171 @entity170 who chairs the @entity202 investigating @entity7 , has said he does not think @entity12 has given the committee all emails related to the attack and last week extended the deadline for her to turn them over .			2

@entity12 claimed march 10 that ' the vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses '
at least some conversations , though , went through aides ' personal addresses
that means they happened entirely outside the scope of *automatic* archiving at the @entity22
@entity187 in @entity66 are probing @entity12 's involvement in an alleged cover - up following the 2012 terror attack in @entity7 , @entity8
