with limited time still in power , president @entity0 is staking his final two years on climate change , pushing the issue to the front of his agenda as he seeks to leave an imprint on the world that will endure after he 's gone			1
it 's a strategy rooted not only in @entity0 's long - stated concern about global warming , but also in political reality			2
two weeks ago , @entity0 watched his prospects for realizing his goals on education , wages and immigration all but evaporate as voters handed his party a stinging rebuke in the midterms , putting @entity21 in full control of @entity23 for the remainder of his presidency			1
in @entity38 , traditionally a @entity36 adversary on environmental issues , @entity0 set an ambitious new target for cutting future @entity36 emissions as part of a landmark deal in which @entity38 will also rein in pollution			1
in @entity31 , he pledged $ 3 billion to help poorer nations address changing temperatures while prodding @entity31 's prime minister to stop questioning the science of climate change			0
' we 're showing there 's no excuse for other nations not to come together , ' @entity0 said in @entity53 , where he also pressed the issue with leaders of the world 's 20 largest economies			1
the emphasis on climate is n't all by choice			0
although @entity0 has long sought to rally action against climate change , @entity62 aides say the issue has become even more attractive after the election because it 's one where @entity0 has considerable leverage to act without @entity23			1
foreign policy is largely the domain of presidents , and at home , @entity0 has aggressively used his regulatory power to curb greenhouse gas emissions over fierce objections from @entity21 and the energy industry			2
' president @entity0 has made no secret that his climate crusade will proceed irrespective of what the @entity36 people want or what other global leaders caution , ' said @entity84 of the @entity85 , which represents the coal industry			1
@entity88 said @entity31 , whose prime minister rose to power promising to gut a hated carbon tax , is a " prime example " of lessons that some have learned but @entity0 has ignored			2
in @entity38 , traditionally a @entity36 adversary on environmental issues , @entity0 set an ambitious new target for cutting future @entity36 emissions as part of a landmark deal in which @entity38 will also rein in pollution she warned the deal with @entity103 , which allows @entity38 's emissions to keep increasing until 2030 , will stall @entity36 's economy while @entity38 's continues to grow ' thanks to affordable , reliable power			1
' climate change advocates said the deal with @entity38 is paving the way for a successful global climate treaty that nations are aiming to finalize next year , because it ups the pressure on reluctant , developing nations like @entity116			2
they argue a successful treaty is the world 's best chance to avert the worst effects of global warming			0
facing dim prospects for @entity126 ratification for a new treaty , the administration is considering strategies where the agreement could be labeled a voluntary expansion of a 1992 climate treaty , relying on joint political pressure to ensure countries comply with certain parts			0
yet on the domestic front , it 's unclear how much more @entity0 can do alone			2
@entity0 said his administration shaped its new goal to cut emissions at least 26 percent by 2025 based on existing legal authorities , rather than relying on future action from @entity23			1
but @entity0 has already picked the low - hanging fruit : pollution limits on @entity36 power plants and emissions standards for cars and trucks , to name the big ones			1
still , @entity62 aides said @entity0 has enlisted his cabinet secretaries to hunt for further steps he can take before the clock runs out on his presidency in early 2017			1
they pointed to increasing renewable fuels as one example			0
and on monday , the @entity62 launched a website — toolkit.climate.gov — to give state and local officials access to federal resources to combat the impact of global warming			0
@entity0 has aggressively used his regulatory power to curb greenhouse gas emissions over fierce objections from @entity21 and the energy industry as @entity0 competed for a second term in the @entity62 in 2012 , he told his top aides he considered climate change to be a key piece of unfinished business , said @entity171 , his deputy campaign manager			1
if he won re-election , he told them , he would take on climate head - on			0
' he sees climate policy as good economic and health policy , but also a moral obligation to future generations — including his own daughters , ' @entity171 said			0
yet even some of @entity0 's existing steps could well be repealed by ascendant @entity21 in @entity23 , who also have plans to stop the president from going any further			1
@entity21 are finding common cause with many @entity185 in trying to force @entity0 to approve @entity186 , a proposed pipeline that would carry tar sands oil from @entity188 to the @entity189			0
and with the @entity21 set to take over the @entity126 in january , @entity21 are already pursuing a concerted effort to gut his @entity192 's rules on power plants , although @entity0 counselor @entity194 predicted they wo n't succeed			2
" the president will complete action			0
it 's a top priority of his , ' @entity194 said monday			0
' and i do n't believe they can stop us from doing that			0
