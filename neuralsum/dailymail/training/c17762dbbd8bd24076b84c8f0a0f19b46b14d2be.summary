the right reverend @entity11 , @entity12 , released a statement on behalf of the @entity5 yesterday , saying it would be ‘ unjust ’ to exclude them if they were ‘ living in accordance with the teaching of the @entity5 on human sexuality ’			0
facing challenging times : the incoming archbishop of canterbury @entity21 may find the announcement on gay bishops - which has divided the church for years - the first test of his tenure however the decision was attacked from all sides , with conservative @entity30 determined to resist it while those campaigning for the church to recognise gay rights were unconvinced it would work			1
the issue has split the established @entity5 since 2003 when gay cleric @entity34 was made @entity35 , but forced to step down after protests			1
now in a chaste civil partnership and serving as @entity38 , he would be allowed to apply for another post			0

move may be first challenge of the next archbishop of @entity42 *'s* tenure
