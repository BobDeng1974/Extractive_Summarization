it comes as @entity11 fears that extremists are planning an attack on an officer similar to that of fusilier @entity15 , killed last year by two fanatics as he walked near his @entity18 barracks			1
now seniors at @entity20 have warned officers to keep a low profile outside of work , issuing advice on what to wear when travelling to work and urging them to keep social media clean of all personal information			1
police officers have been advised not to wear their uniforms on the way to and from work amid concerns that @entity7 extremists are plotting to target them on the streets			1
@entity35 ( left ) and @entity36 ( right ) were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of @entity15 it comes after police raised their internal threat level last month from ' moderate ' to ' substantial ' last month a source told the mirror : ' a raised threat level means officers have to be extra vigilant in everything they do			2
' it means not travelling to work in full uniform and standing out unnecessarily out of work			2
' officers are also being warned about putting sensitive information about their personal lives on social networking sites such as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
' fusilier @entity15 was killed in @entity18 after crossing the road near his barracks military commanders issued similar advice following the murder of drummer @entity15 in @entity18 in may last year			1
they later rescinded the advice that ' uniforms should be concealed while in a public place , particularly when travelling alone or from home to unit			0
' drummer @entity15 was not wearing his uniform when he was attacked , but a @entity68 hooded jumper			0
the @entity43 reports that @entity70 has picked up talk of targeting a @entity73 police officer , and now @entity11 are looking at intelligence that social media profiles of police officers are being monitored by jihadists			1
in october a gang was arrested accused of scouting @entity81 ’s @entity80 police station and @entity84 @entity83 barracks in a ‘ hostile reconnaissance ’ mission using @entity86			0
they were said to have kept @entity56 images of two @entity20 police officers and two community support officers			2
the group is also charged with amassing jihadist material , including videos of beheadings			0
security expert @entity96 told the paper : ' it makes perfect sense that terrorists would be using social media to scout for targets			2
' the risk is that officers and @entity104 giving away precise details of their movements and routines may leave them open to being abducted by fanatics			0
' on saturday it was revealed that internet service providers did not raise the alarm about extreme messages posted by one of the killers of fusilier @entity15 in the six months before his death			1
the companies - who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services - failed to inform authorities about material posted by @entity35 before the attack he carried out with @entity36			0
it meant @entity11 missed internet messages that could have alerted them to the threat posed by the murderers			0
a long - awaited report by @entity132 ’s intelligence watchdog is expected to say @entity35 was posting extremist material on social media sites in the months leading up to the attack			1
the messages would have been sufficiently serious to justify the security services – who had had @entity35 on their radar for eight years – putting him under more detailed surveillance			0
but officers found out about them only after the sickening murder of the 25 - year - old soldier outside @entity145 in may last year			0
the report is expected to conclude that officials could not have prevented the attack on the day .			0
