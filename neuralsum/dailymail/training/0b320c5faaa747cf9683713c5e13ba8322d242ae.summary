the @entity0 is the greatest sporting stage and shop window of all and the footballing feast in @entity5 has served up more than its fair share of magical moments			1
@entity9 clubs will be baying to bag some of the wares on offer , and here are five players @entity14 want to see in @entity15			0
@entity16 – @entity17 – @entity18 – 21 – value : £ 8.5million the @entity17 striker excelled against @entity21 , demonstrating composure and quality in scoring two goals			1
the first goal , beautifully curled past @entity26 , was only usurped by the brilliance of @entity28			0
only 21 years old , @entity18 ’s pacy forward has already represented his country on 40 occasions			0
wonder strike : @entity16 hit two in the loss to @entity21 and can look foward to a showdown with @entity36 in the round of 16 @entity38 – @entity39 – @entity40 – 25 – value : £ 7m three goals in three group games for the @entity44 who began his career as a raiding right - back before being transformed into a prolific forward			1
@entity38 , who scored 18 goals in 23 games for @entity40 in @entity51 last season , also struck with a fine header in the friendly against @entity15 and may be an affordable target for mid-ranking @entity9 sides			1
attention getter : @entity38 has three goals to his name at this @entity0 @entity61 – @entity51 – out of contract - 28 – value : free perhaps the best in individual performances during this @entity0 , the @entity64 produced the save of the tournament as he hurled himself to his right to claw away @entity71 ’s goalbound header in the 0 - 0 draw with @entity5			1
anybody that can keep out @entity5 ’s golden boy for 90 minutes must be worth a look			2
a wanted man : @entity61 is a free agent after his contract with @entity79 expired @entity80 – @entity81 – @entity82 - 27 – value : £ 9m described by the @entity86 press as the ‘ @entity87 ’ , the authoritative @entity82 midfielder has patrolled the @entity88 with his intelligent positioning and sharp anticipation			1
@entity92 in his passing , @entity80 has emerged as one of @entity81 ’s most important players			0
boasting @entity95 and international experience , he would be a shrewd move for one of @entity15 ’s leading sides			2
influential : @entity80 ( right ) , who plays for @entity82 , is one of the bedrocks of @entity81 's success @entity102 – @entity103 - 24 – value : £ 13m the shaggy - haired full back has been relentless up and down @entity102 ’s left flank for @entity107 , displaying defensive acumen in shackling @entity109 in the 2 - 0 victory over @entity81			2
his attacking forays have been the most eye - catching , though , and his remarkable delivery for @entity114 ’s jaw - dropping header against @entity115 created one of this tournament ’s defining moments			0
following in familiar footsteps : @entity102 is son of @entity122 , former @entity103 captain and now one of @entity107 's assistants			0

the @entity0 is the biggest shop window of all and many have shone in @entity5
players such as @entity39 's @entity38 and @entity16 of @entity17 have impressed
and has there been a better individual performance than @entity51 keeper @entity61 's display against @entity5 ?
the ' @entity87 ' is *plying* his trade in @entity139 **...** would he be a shrewd move for a big *gun* ?
@entity102 has also impressed in @entity102 's defence **...** but is he worth his price tag ?
