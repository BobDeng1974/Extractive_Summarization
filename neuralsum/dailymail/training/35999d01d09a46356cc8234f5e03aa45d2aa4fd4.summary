by @entity1 reporter published : 00:40 est , 7 december 2013 updated : 02:18 est , 7 december 2013 after spending decades puzzling over the origin of @entity4 , scientists have suggested that pocket gophers may be the mystery architects of the 8 - foot - tall , 30 - foot - wife dirt pyramids			2
mima mounds - massive , grass - covered round or oval earth pimples - were first discovered in 1841 in western @entity11 in a 630 - acre prairie			1
in the 19th century , explorers came up with a theory that the mounds dating back thousands of years are ancient @entity17 burial sites - but no human remains were ever found inside the loosely packed structures			0
nature 's pyramids : geologists in @entity23 have proposed theory suggesting that pocket gophers are responsible for building these 8 - foot - tall , 30 - foot - wide hills known as @entity4 busy builders : a new computer model shows how over 500 - 700 years , generations of pocket gophers - so named because of their large cheek pouches - could construct a @entity33 mound by adding handfuls of soil and pebbles struggling to explain the existence of millions of @entity4 peppering open fields in @entity11 , @entity41 and @entity42 , experts and amateur geology enthusiasts have come up with a plethora of possible origin stories ranging from natural disasters like earthquakes and floods to aliens			1
however , a recent study spearheaded by geologist @entity50 , of @entity51 in @entity23 , has created a computer model showing how generations of pocket gophers measuring up to 12 inches in length and weighing only a few hundreds grams could plausibly construct a @entity33 mound over 500 - 700 years - one handful of soil and pebbles at a time			1
according to the scientist , the wee burrowing critters are intensely territorial , which could explain why every subsequent generation of gophers would return to the same @entity33 mound , helping to building it up over the course of centuries			0
@entity69 pimples : countless grass - covered @entity4 pepper open fields in @entity11 , @entity41 and @entity42 ‘ what 's really cool about this is scaled by body size , these are the largest structures built by any mammal not including humans , ’ @entity50 told @entity72 's @entity71			1
‘ in terms of effort , it would be like a single person building the pyramids			0
’ @entity50 's computer model , which appeared in the october issue of the journal @entity87 , depicts the interplay between virtual gophers and the unique soil conditions at @entity4 locations			0
what separates pocket gophers - so named because of their large cheek pouches - from other critters in the @entity97 family is that the small furry animals push soil upward rather than downhill while working on their tunnels			1
moving on up : unlike other gophers , the pocket gophers push soil upward instead of hurling it downhill as the theory goes , pocket gophers start pushing soil up , slowly forming a mound , and their descendants are innately drawn to the high spot to continue the work			2
it is important to note that no one has ever seen a @entity33 mound under construction , suggesting that either the building process has stopped , or it is extremely slow			0
@entity115 , a soil scientist at the @entity116 who has studied the state 's @entity4 , said that while @entity50 's model does not provide a definitive proof that pocket gophers are indeed behind the @entity4 , it shows that it is a possibility .			0

mima mounds are grass - covered round or oval hills first discovered in 1841 in western @entity11
pocket gophers , so named because of their cheek pouches , measure up to 12 inches in length and weigh several hundred grams
