a @entity1 - inspired experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in @entity7			1
the hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion , forgetfulness and agitation			1
the idea is borrowed from the 2004 @entity18 film @entity19 , in which @entity21 's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day			1
a suitor , played by @entity18 , uses videos to remind her of him			1
@entity30 @entity29 , director of social services at @entity33 in @entity34 , said the film was ' fluff ' , but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents			1
the film @entity19 starring @entity18 and @entity21 has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in @entity34 , @entity7 ' we 're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day , ' without using drugs , she said			1
' what better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning ? ' as in the film , each day a new video is shown to residents			1
relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning , use memory - triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day			1
people suffering alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning			0
the programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia , those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying			2
ms @entity29 said : ' do we know for sure that they know , this is my daughter , this is my son ? no. ' but they recognise them as somebody they care about and love			0
' the @entity33 is planning to evaluate the programme next month , with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory - care ' neighbourhoods '			1
ms @entity29 said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is ' very positive '			2
@entity89 , a geriatric psychiatrist at @entity90 said the pilot is ' both innovative and thoughtful '			0
' you 've got a group of people with dementia who do n't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there , ' he said			0
' consequently they 're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family			0
' resident @entity106 , 94 , is one of several dementia sufferers at @entity109 , who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation her daughter @entity116 , pictured in the striped top , records messages including stories of happy memories and family get - togethers , signing off with the family goodbye , ' kiss , kiss , i love you ' among the residents taking part in the study is 94 - year - old dementia sufferer , @entity106			1
she wakes up each day to a video from her daughter @entity116 , who sings : ' good morning , merry sunshine , how did you wake so soon ? ' to her mother			2
the five - minute video includes stories of happy memories and get - togethers , and often inspires a bright smile from ms @entity106 , before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye : ' kiss , kiss , i love you			2
' ms @entity116 , said : ' some of her agitation comes from , " who the heck are these people ? why am i here ? "			2
' although ms @entity116 , who lives a few hours away in @entity148 , visits her mother three days a week , she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps			0
' i am there with my mum , loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there 's not a lot i can do for her			0
' other videos include a woman reminding her mother , in @entity157 , to eat and take her medications before telling her : ' i love you , mum			0
' and in another , a man encourages his mother , telling her : ' you used to tell me that attitude is everything			0
you said that it 's best to start off on the sunny side of the street			0

residents at @entity109 in @entity7 are woken by video recordings from loved ones to help ease their confusion and agitation
idea was inspired by the 2004 film @entity19 starring @entity18
