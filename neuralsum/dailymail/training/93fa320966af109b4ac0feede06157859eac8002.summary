the man who runs the @entity1 has launched a bizarre investigation to try to clear a notorious murderer			0
@entity4 has spent thousands of pounds – made from tourists at the museum – on preparing an appeal for the man who murdered dr @entity9 and her daughter @entity10 and left her other little girl , @entity11 , for dead			1
drug addict @entity12 attacked @entity9 , 45 , and @entity10 , six , in a quiet @entity14 country lane in 1996			1
@entity12 , now 53 , was convicted after a fellow prisoner said he had confessed to him			1
battle : @entity4 , left , claims the conviction of killer @entity12 , right , would horrify @entity18 but mr @entity4 believes the real killer is @entity20 , 45 – the man who murdered @entity23 schoolgirl @entity21			1
he has set up a so - called ‘ justice department ’ in the ‘ spirit ’ of @entity18 , aimed at overturning miscarriages of justice , and is preparing evidence for the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , which refers cases for appeal			1
the armchair detective , who runs the museum at @entity18 ’s fictional address of @entity35 in @entity36 , said : ‘ the trial and conviction of @entity12 would have caused the author of the @entity18 stories to choke on his pipe			1
victims : @entity9 and @entity43 were found dead on a country lane in @entity14 in 1996 ‘ we are in touch with @entity12 and he is delighted that someone is taking an interest in his case			1
but this is not about exonerating people			0
this is about catching the perpetrator			0
‘ this is what @entity18 did in the books			0
he was a forerunner of forensics to solve a case – and that ’s how to solve the @entity12 case , using forensics and not listening to the gossip			2
you have got to look at the dna rather than gossip of prisoners			0
there is no dna from @entity12 on the big long lace , used to strangle @entity10			1
‘ the dna does n’t lie and it rules out @entity12			2
we need the case to be looked at again			0
’ for @entity9 ’s surviving daughter , @entity11 , now 23 , who has gone on to rebuild her life , it raises the upsetting prospect of having the whole case dragged through the courts once again			2
two juries , one at a retrial in 2001 , found @entity12 guilty of the murders and in 2010 the @entity28 rejected @entity12 ’s efforts to have his case reheard once more			1
last year the museum spent £ 10,000 on a legal challenge to try to get @entity84 to disclose dna evidence which mr @entity4 believes will open up the case			1
but a judge refused the request , saying it was nothing more than a ‘ fishing expedition ’ that would not come ‘ within a mile ’ of casting doubt on @entity12 ’s guilt			2
he added that @entity11 and her father @entity94 deserved ‘ finality ’			0
other forensic investigations funded by the museum have already borne fruit			0
@entity99 who was jailed in 2005 for murdering a @entity101 student has had his conviction been sent back to the @entity103			0
mr @entity4 gathered the funds earned from his museum in @entity35 dedicated to the character mr @entity4 is no stranger to controversy			1
he was sued by his 86 - year - old mother @entity108 last year over control of nearly £ 2 million of ticket and gift shop receipts from the museum			0
mrs @entity113 helped set up the museum in 1999			2
she took the claim to the @entity116 after family members raised concerns about missing funds			0
but last night mr @entity4 told @entity120 he had settled the case with his mother and that they were now on good terms .			0

@entity4 spent thousands on appeal for drug addict @entity12
killer jailed after @entity9 , 45 , and @entity10 , six , found dead in @entity14 in 1996
museum owner believes @entity20 , @entity21 *'s* killer , was behind attack
has set up own ' justice department ' in ' spirit ' of fictional detective
