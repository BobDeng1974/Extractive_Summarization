the first video of the $ 300million @entity2 hypersonic spacecraft has been released following its ill - fated second test flight			1
the 13,000mph unmanned aircraft of the future took off for a crucial test flight from a @entity8 rocket pad earlier this month			0
it travelled to the edge of space and was due to glide back down to @entity12 at roughly four miles per second but all contact was lost and the craft was thought to have crashed			1
first footage : the @entity2 ( circled ) can be seen in the video streaking across the sky at @entity18 shortly before it crashed into the sea @entity2 - 2 : the aircraft can travel at 20 times the speed of sound - or 13,000mph			1
it is part of research effort by @entity24 to one day make long - duration hypersonic flight a reality this still from a video released by @entity24 shows the difference in speed between the @entity2 , soaring through the centre , a @entity27 ( right ) and an f - 18 fighter jet ( left ) now video footage of its penultimate moments has been released by the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) and while it does n't show the craft 's ' controlled descent ' into the @entity39 , it does give some ideas of its incredible speed			1
the soundless footage shows the @entity2 streaking across the sky at @entity18 on august 11			1
the video was made by a crew member aboard the @entity46 , the first monitoring vessel able to visually track the @entity2 's initial entry into the atmosphere			2
@entity24 director @entity50 says the video , ' gives us a visceral feel for what it means to fly at @entity18			2
' on the ground : this photo from @entity57 shows a @entity59 rocket standing beside @entity60 - 8 in @entity8 , which the hypersonic glider was due to launch from @entity62 : the mission might lead to new records , super weapons and eventually global travel at colossal speeds			0
the aircraft is unmanned , rocket - launched and manoeuvrable name : @entity2 mission : to provide the @entity71 with its first in a new generation of sub-orbital weaons			1
top speed : 13,000mph or @entity76			0
a @entity77 can typically reach @entity78 2.3 , or 1,520mph length : 12ft long weight : 900kg materials : made of experimental material that can withstand up to 3,500f ( @entity83 ) it will experience upon re-entry			0
cost : $ 308million ( Â£ 189million ) , so far payload : potentially anything up to 12,000lbs , including a nuclear bomb			0
range : anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes as a companion piece to the video , @entity24 also released a simulated speed comparison between the @entity2 , a @entity27 and an f - 18 fighter jet , which show the @entity2 making mincemeat of its competitors among the clouds			1
the @entity2 is currently being developed by @entity24 and the @entity98 as part of research into a new generation of weapons with the potential to strike rogue states anywhere on @entity12 in under 60 minutes			2
however , it is hoped the craft could one day make long - haul hypersonic flight a reality as at up to 20 times the speed of sound it would slash the flying time from @entity111 to @entity112 to just an hour			2
the @entity2 reaches such a high speed partly because of its own weight descending through @entity12 's atmosphere , but also because of the experimental engines on board which are designed to run at extreme velocities			2
the test - flight featured in the @entity24 video was the team 's second attempt at making science fiction a reality			0
the first test had to be aborted last year after its onboard systems detected a fault			0
an artist 's impression of the rocket which carried the @entity2 to the edge of space the second attempted flight lifted off from @entity57 on board an @entity136 rocket , which took the @entity2 - 2 to the edge of the atmosphere			1
after it separated from the rocket , it was supposed to glide over the @entity39 at up to 20 times the speed of sound			0
the take - off went well but contact was lost with the craft at the glide phase .			0

@entity2 can be seen traveling at @entity18 - 13,000mph
$ 300million craft crashed into the sea on its first *outing*
