by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 18:59 est , 9 november 2012 the body of an unidentified @entity3 fighter allegedly murdered by five @entity4 in @entity5 may never be found , it emerged last night			1
a team of forensic scientists and military police – protected by 120 soldiers – has flown to @entity10 to investigate the hugely sensitive murder claims			1
but the remains have still to be discovered and , even if they are , they may never be positively identified because nobody knows who he was			2
heat of battle : fighting in @entity10 has pushed the @entity4 to the limit details of the extraordinary search in the warzone have emerged days after the five troops won a court battle to protect their anonymity during their forthcoming trial because of ‘ an immediate and real risk ’ to their lives from terrorists			1
the @entity4 first appeared in court last month			1
they are accused of murdering a captured @entity5 national on or about september 15 last year , and were charged after the discovery of video footage on one of the men ’s computers , allegedly showing them discussing what to do with a gravely injured captive			1
it is the prosecution case that the man – whose name does not appear on any charge sheet – was subsequently murdered			2
the case has prompted an enormous public backlash with a @entity45 campaign attracting over 100,000 supporters and protest marches across @entity48 demanding the charges be dropped			1
none of the accused can be identified after judge advocate general @entity52 this week extended an anonymity order			0
one protester , former @entity55 @entity54 , 34 – a veteran of two tours in @entity5 – said the charges against the five were unjust			1
he said : ‘ they were doing their job in incredibly difficult circumstances			0
most of our politicians have not been out to @entity5 and can never imagine what it is like to be at war			2
’ hugely sensitive : a team of forensic scientists and military police has been dispatched to @entity10 ( pictured ) to investigate the hugely murder claims unusually , the charges were brought even though a body has not been found			1
in a region littered with booby - trap bombs and still infested with insurgents , it is the investigators ’ task to search for it			0
tribal elders have had to be asked for permission for the search to go ahead and , potentially , a body being exhumed			0
there is also the question of how the remains might be positively identified			0
although thousands of @entity5 males have been biometrically recorded to allow quick identification by troops , the biometric information may not have survived decomposition			1
in addition , it has now emerged that the five @entity4 had for several days been fighting the @entity3 in a desperate life - or - death struggle , described by one comrade as ‘ a daily survival lottery ’			1
the case has focused attention too on the rules of engagement and how @entity48 applies the law to its servicemen and women operating under the pressures of the battlefield			1
the @entity4 were part of a @entity104 in and around @entity105 , a rural area of @entity10 that was once the @entity3 ’s heartland – an area stained with the blood of dozens of @entity48 servicemen			1
' survival lottery ' : more than 20 troops had died in @entity10 - seven of them @entity4 - in the six months leading up to the alleged killing ( file photo ) in an area known as @entity115 , their remote checkpoint base had come under fierce attack at least eight times and patrols from it were regularly ambushed			1
in the six months leading up to the alleged killing last september , more than 20 troops had died in the province , seven of them @entity4			1
the small band of commandos – between 20 and 30 men – felt isolated in their mud - walled checkpoint , and are said to have stockpiled captured @entity3 guns and ammunition in case their own ran out			2
morale across the @entity4 was dealt a further blow with the death of a popular comrade , @entity134 , 23 , on august 5 last year when a ten - man patrol was attacked by a force of around 80 @entity3 in the @entity138 region			1
after four hours the patrol managed to pull back to their base with the help of air support and mortar fire			0
as is routine after a patrol , @entity134 had taken off his helmet ahead of an operational debrief			0
it was then that the @entity3 attacked again			2
@entity134 , a father - to - be , was fatally wounded in the head by a grenade			0
in the following days and weeks there were more attacks in @entity10 ; one base came under sustained fire for ten successive days			2
in mid-september the fanatics mounted another attack on an isolated base , leaving more than 20 @entity4 pinned down			0
it is the aftermath of this attack that is the focus of the investigations			0
an @entity161 helicopter was called in and was able to end the @entity3 assault			0
once the fighting subsided , a gunman was found with severe wounds and allegedly close to death			0
the video footage allegedly shows @entity4 discussing what to do with him			2
several are said to have held a vote			0
their options were to treat his wounds and ensure his evacuation to @entity178 or take him to their @entity179 for treatment			0
last october the @entity4 returned home to a heroes ’ welcome and , officials say , it is likely that whatever happened would have remained secret , had it not been for the arrest of one of the men by civilian police investigating a completely unrelated matter			2
as part of that inquiry they seized his laptop , found the footage from the compound , and alerted the military			0
investigators have questioned officers and fellow @entity4 while @entity5 interpreters are being traced			1
the five @entity4 – known only as @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 – face a @entity206 and their initial appearance was behind closed doors in @entity209 on the edge of @entity211 in @entity212			0
