a @entity1 jury reached a mixed verdict friday in the second round of patent infringement litigation between tech giants @entity6 and @entity9 , awarding @entity6 a fraction of the amount asked of the jury while awarding an even smaller amount to @entity9 's counterclaim			1
the eight - person jury returned a verdict finding that @entity9 had infringed on two @entity6 software patents , awarding the company a total of $ 119.6 million			1
the jury also found in favor of @entity9 in their counterclaim , awarding them $ 158,400 for the infringement of one patent			1
the $ 119.6 million is barely more than five per cent of the $ 2.2 billion in damages @entity6 asked of the court			1
it is also much less than the $ 930 million @entity6 was awarded in 2012 in the same court , the @entity28 for the @entity29 , in @entity30			1
a jury returned a verdict in the @entity6 v. @entity9 patent infringement case friday , awarding @entity6 $ 119.6 million for their damages boxes of documents shown outside of the federal courthouse in @entity30 , @entity1 , on april 28 , 2014			1
the jury heard four weeks of trial before deliberating on a verdict in this litigation , @entity6 accused @entity9 of ' slavishly ' lifting numerous technologies from the @entity43 for use in @entity9 's product line			2
the jury was asked to decide on five patents , deciding that all @entity9 phones infringed on @entity6 's ' quick links ' patent , while only some of @entity9 's phones infringed on @entity6 's ' slide - to - lock ' patent			1
@entity56 district judge @entity55 had previously ruled on a motion for summary judgment that some of @entity9 's phones infringed on @entity6 's ' auto - correct ' patent			1
two other patents , including background syncing and unified search , were not found to be infringed upon by @entity9			2
in addition , the jury found that @entity6 infringed one of @entity9 's patents			1
the four man , four woman jury deliberated for three days following a four week trial			0
at trial @entity6 characterized @entity9 as thieves , with @entity6 attorney @entity72 telling the court that @entity9 's ' illegal strategy has been wildly successful			2
' @entity9 's counsel disputed this claim , arguing that @entity6 was simply trying to attack another nemesis , @entity78 , by preventing the the sale of products like the @entity81 , which use @entity78 's @entity83 operating system			2
according to @entity9 , the lawsuit was part of @entity6 's ' holy war ' against @entity78 , declared by the late @entity87 in response his belief that @entity83 ripped off @entity6 's @entity90			2
' they want to attack @entity78 and @entity83 by attacking the most successful @entity83 maker , ' said attorney @entity92 in @entity9 's closing arguments			0
speculation has arisen that the court 's verdict proved to be favorable to both @entity9 and @entity78			0
not only did @entity6 again fail to obtain a court injunction preventing @entity9 from selling their allegedly infringing phones in the @entity56 , but the two patents in which @entity78 had agreed to indemnify @entity9 ( the background syncing and unified search ) were not found to be infringing by the jury			1
some experts claim that the jury 's verdict was favorable to not only @entity9 , but @entity78 as well			0
@entity6 maintains that they are glad to prevail in the jury 's verdict the $ 119.6 million awarded by the jury will likely not be the final total			1
in a review after the verdict was returned , @entity6 lawyers noticed an error with the way the jury made one calculation , forgetting to assess damages for one @entity9 product that was found to infringe an @entity6 patent			1
@entity6 attorneys @entity72 ( pictured left ) and @entity119 ( pictured right ) walk in to a federal courthouse in @entity30 , @entity1 , on april 28 , 2014			0
@entity6 prevailed on three claims of patent infringement against @entity9			1
the jury will return on monday at 9am to assess this oversight			0
the additional amount the jury will add to the verdict will not change the general result of the case for @entity6			2
despite the jury 's award being significantly less than what they asked for , attorneys for @entity6 maintained satisfaction regarding winning in some capacity			2
' we are grateful to the jury and the court for their service , ' a representative for @entity6 told re / code			0
' todayâ € ™ s ruling reinforces what courts around the world have already found : that @entity9 willfully stole our ideas and copied our products			0
we are fighting to defend the hard work that goes into beloved products like the @entity43 , which our employees devote their lives to designing and delivering for our customers			0
' both sides will likely file post-trial motions in the coming weeks , and may appeal the result depending on how the court rules			0
@entity9 is still appealing the 2012 ruling in which they were ordered to pay @entity6 $ 930 million			1
this litigation is the latest in an ongoing legal war the tech giants have been locked in , spanning worldwide			0
this verdict comes when the two have begun to experience stalling in what was unprecedented growth			0
both companies have been losing market share			0
two years ago , @entity6 and @entity9 accounted for more than 55 per cent of world - wide smartphones shipments , according to research firm @entity170			2
in the first quarter of 2104 , that number has fallen to 47 per cent			0
according to the study , smaller @entity175 rivals upstarts such as @entity176 and @entity177 have been making gains , with a @entity177 takeover of @entity181 pending in several countries .			0

$ 119.6 million award less than ten per cent of $ 2.2 billion sought by @entity6
patents infringed upon : ' quick - link ' , ' slide - to - lock ' and ' auto - correct '
