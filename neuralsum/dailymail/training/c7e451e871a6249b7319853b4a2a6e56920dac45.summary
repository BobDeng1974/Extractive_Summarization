the fuel price war is driving the cost of petrol back towards 99p a litre , experts said yesterday as the @entity6 supermarkets announced another price cut			1
@entity10 once again led the charge by slashing a further 2p off the price of unleaded and 1p off the price of diesel across its @entity17 forecourts , with @entity18 , @entity8 ’s and @entity9 swiftly following suit			0
the cuts mean @entity10 customers will pay no more than 110.7p a litre for petrol , with the company 's diesel costing 117.7p a litre			0
on september 28 , @entity10 ’s petrol price was as high as 126.7p a litre , with diesel at 129.7p a litre			2
slashed : supermarket giant @entity10 has sparked a new round of price cuts at the pumps by slashing another 2p off the price of its petrol with the price of crude oil plummeting – it has fallen to below $ 60 a barrel this week – the @entity37 said it was ‘ optimistic ’ that petrol could dip below £ 1 a litre in the new year			1
this would take prices at the pumps to their lowest level since the end of may 2009 when the average price was 99.9p			2
fuel price - trackers @entity49 said that on tuesday , before the latest price drops , unleaded was selling at an average @entity17 price of 116.32p per litre – compared with a high of 141.48p in april 2012			0
motorists have already seen £ 1 knocked off the average price of a fill - up after prices plummeted by more than 2p over the weekend			1
the @entity37 predicted that within the next fortnight , average @entity17 petrol prices would fall to below 110p a litre and diesel to under 116p			1
@entity37 fuel spokesman @entity64 said : ‘ we have every reason to think petrol at under £ 1 early in 2015 is a very real prospect			1
‘ the cost of visiting family and friends this @entity70 will be the cheapest it ’s been for nearly five years , but the prospect of petrol going below £ 1 a litre in the new year is incredible , particularly when prices at the beginning of 2014 seemed to be heading ever upwards			1
’ the @entity37 said motorists have become so used to high petrol prices that many had forgotten that they had ever been less than £ 1 a litre			1
the @entity37 said in a report that it was ‘ optimistic ’ that petrol prices could fall below £ 1 a litre because the price of @entity89 crude has fallen below the $ 60 - a - barrel mark for the first time since early july 2009			1
going down : the price of @entity89 crude has fallen below the $ 60 ( £ 38 ) - a-barrel mark for the first time since early july 2009			2
pictured above is a pump jack at sunrise near @entity95 , @entity96 it is predicted to ‘ keep on dropping ’ after the @entity103 - dominated oil cartel @entity102 – the @entity102 – indicated that it will not cut production ‘ even if oil hits $ 40 a barrel ’			0
the @entity37 added : ‘ in july 2009 the average price of unleaded was 103.09p a litre and diesel 104.22p , due to the slightly stronger pound which affects pump prices as fuel is traded in dollars			1
' the pound is currently a little weaker than it was then at $ 1.57			0
there is a very good chance forecourt prices will continue to fall as the price of a barrel of crude goes lower			2
’ @entity10 ’s petrol trading director , @entity117 , said : ‘ we ’re giving drivers an early @entity70 present as fuel prices continue to fall			2
it is our 11th price cut since september			0
’ @entity18 ’ petrol director , @entity122 , said : ‘ recent wholesale price drops have allowed us to pass savings on to the customer			0
’ diesel is 15.91p cheaper – 122.33p a litre now compared to 138.24p in january			0
on monday , the average supermarket price of fuel was 114.26p for petrol and 120.18p for diesel			0
he said : ' current forecasts are for average petrol prices to fall to below 110p a litre in the next fortnight and diesel to drop to under 116p			1
' at these average prices across the country the cheapest retailers will almost certainly be selling petrol for around 105p a litre , or even lower			0

@entity37 predicts petrol prices will fall to below £ 1.10 within next fortnight
*group* believes ' petrol at under £ 1 early in 2015 is a very real prospect '
petrol was last averaging under £ 1 a litre in may 2009 at price of 99.9p
