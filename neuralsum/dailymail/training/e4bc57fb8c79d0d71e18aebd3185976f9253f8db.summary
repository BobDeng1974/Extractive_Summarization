she said : ' i can feed my family on £ 30 a week			1
they even get extras and treats , but they 're not rubbish and not processed			2
' i have had no choice , and this was through no fault of my own			0
' i go to supermarkets like @entity8 and @entity9			1
they reduce some of the good quality food at certain times of the day			1
' just because i 'm on benefits , why should i be feeding my children processed sugar ? ' ms @entity10 receives £ 221 a week in tax credit , employment support allowance and child benefits but insists it 's easy to live off and she still manages to cook fresh , healthy meals every day			1
over the last few months she has managed to buy a selection of ten @entity9 sandwiches for £ 1 , a selection of organic @entity8 vegetables for less than £ 1 , lamb steaks reduced to 5p from @entity64 and an entire grocery shop from @entity66 - that at full price would have cost £ 80 - for £ 12			1
she said she uses the bulk of her budget to buy quality meat , before padding out meals with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables			1
' the food is marked down because it 's going out of date in a day or so , but because i cook everything fresh every day it makes no difference , ' she said			0

' i have given my children the opportunity to know that just because we do n't have money , it does n't mean we ca n't eat good , proper food			1

she said : ' people on benefits who can work need to go out to work			1
life would be better for them			0
they need to get off their bums and go out and earn a living			0
' people should go out to work and if they have children then they should go out to work once their children reach a certain age			1
' i was used to a nice house , where my children did n't really go short of anything			2
i had the choice of whatever , and could provide for them			0
' we went from that to having to survive on benefits which was a nightmare			2
' i have never claimed anything before so i did n't know anything about it or what i was entitled to			0
' she described the treatment she received while trying to sign on for benefits as ' abysmal ' , and said she puts it down to the amount of people claiming			1
she said at one point , social services went to her home and checked her fridge , freezer and cupboards for food before she was given a £ 30 emergency payment so she could feed her children			1
' it was absolutely appalling , ' she said			0
' they even asked my daughter what she was having for dinner to try and catch me out			0

i was n't treated with any kind of sympathy			0
' no - one got back to me			2

instead of receiving £ 2,000 a month , she now receives £ 221 a week ' the whole system is flawed and people take advantage , but then someone likes me comes along and gets treated abysmally , but it was through no fault of my own			1

' all my dresses are amazing			0
' her other secrets to saving money are buying in bulk and bartering with shops for a reduction in prices			2
she added : ' i barter all the time			0
there was this table which was solid oak and meant to be £ 500 but i got it for £ 100			2
it 's knowing the shops to go to			2
my bed was £ 1,000 and i paid £ 400 for it			0
' it works a lot of the time and you 've got nothing to lose			0
they can either say yes or no and they want the sale			0
i 'll also go to @entity273 and buy things in bulk like washing powder and washing up liquid			0
it works out a lot cheaper			0
' the things i buy just are n't as extravagant			0
' she also empties the coins from her purse into a jar at the end of the day and uses them to top up petrol , at supermarket self - service machines and to put towards days out for her family to places that charge minimal entry , like historic buildings			2

depending on her health , ms @entity10 , who is also mother to @entity296 , 19 , and @entity297 , 15 , hopes to return to work as soon as possible			1
