by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 21 november 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 21 november 2013 teenage boys and girls at a secondary school are sharing the same toilets - to the outrage of parents			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , merged two blocks last month in a bid to cut bullying in ' intimidating ' single - sex toilets			1
but parents said the move could have the opposite effect - and teenagers with ' raging hormones ' may shift their amorous liasons away from the bike sheds and onto school property			1
anger : these unisex toilets were installed for pupils in @entity7 , @entity8			1
one parent said it would encourage ' raging hormones and teenage angst ' while another criticised the lack of mirrors mother - of - two @entity31 , 39 , said : ' if the kids are dating there will be no more " round the back of the bike sheds " - it will be the toilets they escape to			2
' at a time of raging hormones and teenage angst they need their own personal and separate space			2
' i think this is a very bad idea			0
' headteacher @entity46 is believed to have made the controversial decision with the backing of school governors			2
he said : ' we want to provide excellent facilities for our students and this design is intended to reduce both bullying and vandalism , as traditional toilet areas can be intimidating and unpleasant areas for students to go into			1
' there are also other toilets in the school which have remained single - sex - only			1
headteacher @entity46 defended the move saying other toilets were ' intimidating and unpleasant ' unisex school toilets are far from flash - in - the - pan - they were introduced six years ago			1
the now - defunct company which ran @entity68 's @entity70 programme said the mixed - sex facilities could stop bullying			1
guidelines signed off by @entity68 's @entity74 also said urinals should be scrapped , glass - panelled walls installed between sinks and background noise increased to ensure ' aural privacy '			1
hand - washing areas would also be moved to semi-open corridors near the cubicles , where staff could see them			1
and each school was recommended to have an extra self - contained lavatory with its own sink , where pupils could have more privacy			2
the parents ' group @entity90 opposed the facilities previously , too , saying : ' it â€™s very important that young people are not allowed to be pressured by the opposite sex and can retain their modesty			1
' however , they are believed to have been installed in hundreds of schools which were built or revamped under @entity70 , which was axed in 2010			2
they have become so widespread that national building firms have a ' stock design ' for unisex toilets			0
but the mixed toilet , which has two boys ' and two girls ' cubicles with a shared wash basin and hand dryer , has annoyed parents in other ways			1
it has no mirrors , supposedly to stop it becoming a social hub			0
one parent , who did not want to be named , said : ' girls , especially teenagers , care about their appearance , even more so when they are at a school with boys , so to remove the mirrors is ridiculous			0
' they should be allowed to keep their appearance up , even if it is a simple thing such as making sure they look presentable			0
' even for the boys , they might want to re-arrange their tie if it has gone a bit wonky			0
' she added : ' i have a daughter who goes to the school and she deserves privacy when she goes to the bathroom			0
teenage girls go through changes , everyone knows that , it can be a delicate and embarrassing moment in their lives			0
' it is just a gross breach of privacy			0
' former headteacher @entity141 , 62 , is the chairman of the volunteer parents ' group the @entity142 and worked as a teacher for 35 years			1
he said he was ' extremely sceptical ' , adding : ' it may actually increase bullying because it is an area that teachers will rarely go - it could drive bullying underground , behind closed doors , in a way			2
' there 's no reason why it will possibly reduce any form of bullying			0
' toilets are , and should be , private for both sexes			0
mixing them could cause a disaster and children would probably want to have separate toilets			0
' pupils are under enough pressure as it is in school			0
' i do believe it will be worse for the girls - and i would n't be surprised if most of the students do n't want to go to the toilet while they are in school			2
the changes took place last month at @entity7 in @entity8 , which has more than 1,500 pupils he added : ' it seems to be an exceptional decision , i have n't heard many like this before			1
it does n't seem logical at all			0
' the school , graded good by @entity179 this year , has more than 1,500 pupils and was made a specialist science college in 2002			0
@entity181 mr @entity46 said : ' the new area is being used regularly and safely , and the only adverse comment that has come from the students is regarding the absence of mirrors ; a deliberate decision to avoid toilet areas becoming areas for social gathering			2

four cubicles installed at mixed - sex @entity7 in @entity8
headteacher *claims* they will combat ' intimidating ' toilet atmosphere
