@entity0 and @entity1 will fight it out for the season 's first piece of silverware in the @entity7 final at @entity8 on saturday			1
here , @entity10 columnist @entity9 takes a look at the key battles that will decide which part of @entity14 brings home the trophy ... @entity0 will line up against @entity14 rivals @entity16 in the @entity7 final at @entity8 on sunday @entity19 v @entity17 hazard is surely the player @entity16 are most scared of — he ’s @entity0 ’s match - winner			1
the @entity22 has scored in both games against @entity16 this season but a third would be the most important			2
@entity17 is a tremendous athlete who can match him for pace and power			0
but the runs @entity19 makes in behind the full back are brilliant and @entity17 can sometimes be bamboozled by movement like that			1
he will need to have the game of his life			0
@entity17 will be tasked with stopping @entity19 who has scored in both games against @entity16 this term @entity39 v @entity37 the @entity0 striker has been trying to make it out that he ’s being picked on and i ca n’t stop laughing			1
he ’s an absolute beast and can handle himself			0
he is a match - winner , @entity0 ’s battering ram and focal point and @entity37 will be up against it			1
@entity37 is only 21 but he ’s quick and strong			0
like all young players he has had a few iffy moments and this cup final will be another level up for him			0
but he ’s talented and with a few early touches to calm the nerves , he can compete			0
@entity16 defender @entity37 is up against it with the @entity55 's joint top scorer @entity39 @entity58 v @entity56 @entity56 was rested in the @entity59 on thursday and that shows you how highly rated he is by @entity62			1
the middle of the park is where the game is won and lost and @entity56 must and can get after @entity58			2
he ca n’t let @entity67 dictate the game , he must hurry him up all the time , make him uncomfortable			0
some players kick a ball and others pass it			0
he ’ll be nervous — i remember cramping up in my first @entity8 final — but he is key to @entity1 winning			2
@entity56 must find a way to stop @entity58 from dictating the game from midfield @entity79 or @entity80 v @entity81 @entity82 has a big decision : the experience of @entity80 or @entity79 , his new go - to man against @entity16 ’ biggest weapon			1
@entity80 should have been sent off in the 5 - 3 defeat by @entity16 for kicking out at @entity81 so i would not be surprised to see @entity79 start			1
his pace and power could see him get the nod			0
i ’ll be at @entity8 with @entity92 and i ca n’t wait to see @entity81 in this game			2
he ’ll be so excited , dying to show everyone what he can do			0
if he performs and @entity1 win , he ’ll cement his place as an icon at @entity16 for years to come			2
@entity1 's goalscoring expectations will rest on the young shoulders of @entity81 ( centre ) @entity82 has a selection dilemma in deciding between @entity79 and @entity80 in defence			1

@entity0 face @entity1 in the @entity7 final on sunday
@entity17 must stop @entity19 running at @entity16
@entity37 has his work *cut* out handling top scorer @entity39
@entity56 ca *n't* allow @entity58 to dictate play from midfield
either @entity80 of @entity79 will be tasked with containing @entity81
