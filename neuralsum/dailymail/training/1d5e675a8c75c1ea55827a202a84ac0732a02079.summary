by @entity0 @entity1 had @entity2 to launch his platinum - selling career , and now a new teen @entity5 heartthrob is using a fresh online tactic to dominate the charts			1
this sunday , @entity9 's @entity8 took the no. 1 spot on @entity11 with his debut album , capitalizing on the success of his massive following on @entity15 , where the 15 - year - old old has spent years cultivating a base with of 2.9 million followers with short clips of his falsetto			1
the @entity21 reports it only took 37 minutes for the @entity22 to top the charts , as his 1.47 million @entity25 followers tweeted # shawntonumber1			1
' i posted a six - second clip of me singing ' @entity41 ' by @entity1 in august and it was an overnight sort of explosion , ' he told @entity43			2
' when i woke up and i had 10,000 likes on that video , i was like , ‘ what is going on ? ’ social media is taking off			0
it ’s an entire new world out there			0
' like any teen idol or online sensation , he 's drawing his share of think pieces and criticism			2
at the @entity56 , @entity55 called @entity8 an ' emotional do - gooder ' with a debut single that is ' depressing and dull			1
' ' taken together , these videos reveal him as the teenager he is , a not - quite - formed talent who thinks vibrato makes him sound serious and falsetto makes him sound irresistible , ' @entity55 writes			0
' but earnestness is just about the worst thing you can carry with you into a pop music career — earnest attitude is one thing , earnest presentation and production something else entirely			0
that misunderstanding hovers over “ the @entity22 ” ( @entity75 ) , mr. @entity8 ’s first release on a major label , and his highest - profile attempt at putting his tender voice to work on originals , not covers			2
' another @entity5 teen pop idol , @entity1 , got his start with clips on @entity2 but whether any of that actually matters is debatable , as @entity86 writer @entity85 argues in a post titled ' @entity88 is number 1 on @entity89 to @entity90			0
' ' @entity91 , the @entity56 nor @entity92 note that @entity8 's audience is mainly young women , ' @entity85 writes			1
' a group that keeps on proving itself a force to be reckoned with , whether it 's @entity98 movie tickets , the @entity100 juggernaut , or the fact that the album from @entity103 debuted at number 2 on the billboard charts			1
do n't underestimate the power of a passionate pack of teenage girls			0

only took 37 minutes for his debut ep to top the online music store 's sales charts
