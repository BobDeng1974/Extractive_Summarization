by @entity0 published : 06:32 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 11:18 est , 3 january 2013 wealthy : businessman @entity2 says he is not bothered by the loss of his £ 100,000 @entity4 a lottery winner who spent part of his winnings on a £ 100,000 @entity4 saw his prized possession written off when he tried to drive through a flooded road			1
@entity2 bought the luxury car after landing a £ 5million jackpot in 2008 , and it was his ' pride and joy ' until it was destroyed yesterday morning			1
but the wealthy businessman insisted he was not overly upset by the loss - and revealed he had already bought a brand - new @entity16 to replace it			1
the 65 - year - old management consultant , from @entity18 , was on his way to a meeting when he became stuck in flood water in @entity22 , @entity23			2
he was driving along a country lane on the outskirts of town when the black @entity27 was swamped by three feet of water from a stream which had burst its banks			0
an aa rescue truck soon arrived at the scene , but could not remove the car as @entity34 can only be towed from the front and mr @entity2 's car was accessible only from the back			1
soon the flood waters rose so high that the @entity40 truck could not reach the car at all , and mr @entity2 , a grandfather and father of four , was forced to abandon it altogether			1
mr @entity2 won £ 5million on the lottery in 2008 , but decided not to go public with his winnings			1
and speaking today from his modest home in @entity47 , a hamlet just outside @entity18 , he revealed he had been quick to replace his expensive car			2
' i do n't know what all the fuss is about , it 's just a flooded @entity4 , ' he said			1
' i 've gone out and got a new car			0
' @entity2 was on his way to see me for a business meeting when he got stuck , ' mr @entity65 said			1
' he rang me and said , " i ca n't see you today because i 've wrecked my car in the bloody floods			0
" ' he 's driven down that road , even when it was flooded , hundreds of times before			0
he obviously misjudged how deep it was and when he pressed the accelerator the wheels just span and the car started to float off			0
' apparently water was gushing through the bottom of the car but he managed to open the door and wade to safety			0
' @entity87 : mr @entity2 apparently knew the road well and was over-confident about his chances of getting through rescue : another man was seen retrieving the keys to the @entity4 after the driver had abandoned it confusion : mr @entity2 might have been misled by the fact that he owns another car which has a snorkel mr @entity65 added that mr @entity2 had carried on working after his lottery win , as he has three ex-wives to support - and claimed that despite his wealth , the businessman was devastated to see his £ 100,000 car damaged beyond repair			1
' he is gutted , he loved that car , ' mr @entity65 said			0
' it was his pride and joy , and writing off a £ 100,000 car is not going to put you in the best of moods			2
' i 've known him 30 years but he 's not the friendliest of people - even after his big win			0
' @entity2 also has a 1940 @entity63 with a snorkel , which he probably thought he was driving when he went through the floods			2
' warning : mr @entity2 will be wishing he had heeded the nearby sign pointing out the wet conditions wildlife : the floods may be bad news for motorists , but they have been a boon for aquatic birds neighbours yesterday described @entity2 as a ' flash harry ' who would quickly recover from the loss of his car			1
one said : ' @entity131 is one of the nicest people you will ever meet			0
a bit of a wheeler dealer but a smashing bloke			0
' he has always worked hard and then he got very lucky with his big lottery win			0
' he 's always been a bit of a flash @entity141 and i do n't think losing his @entity4 in the floods would have ruffled his feathers too much when he got over the initial shock			2

@entity2 , 65 , shunned publicity after £ 5million jackpot win in 2008
spent part of winnings on luxury @entity4 which has now been written off
replaced car with a brand new @entity16 immediately after *accident*
