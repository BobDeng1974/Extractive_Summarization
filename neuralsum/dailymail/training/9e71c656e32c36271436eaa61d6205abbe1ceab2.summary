forget trying to catch waves , this brave paddle boarder appeared to be hitching a ride on the back of a whale			2
@entity5 was floating just off shore near @entity7 , in @entity8 , when the colossal creature emerged from the water just a few feet behind him			2
totally unaware of the massive mammal , mr @entity5 continued to circle the bay in a leisurely fashion before the whale surfaced alongside him			1
mr @entity21 , who was on holiday with his wife @entity22 from @entity33 , even tracked down mr @entity5 who had been completely unaware of the giant mammal , which had its calf in tow			1
the 65 - year - old said : ' at first glance it looked as if the boarder was surfing on the whale			0
' mr @entity21 said he had noticed mr @entity5 paddling around the bay , where he and his wife had earlier seen whales breaching in the water , as he ate his breakfast			1
he said : ' i then saw a whale swim past the boarder , who did not seem fazed at all , a cool dude obviously , and he then paddled back to shore			2
mr @entity21 tracked down mr @entity5 who said there was two humpback whales in the water with him mr @entity5 was said to have been ' amazed ' at the images , completely unaware how it looked from the shore ' i tracked down the paddle boarder after he arrived back on shore			1
he said the whale got very close but even he was amazed at the picture			0
' he says there were two humpback whales , probably a mother and juvenile			0
however , only one breached near him			0
' it was an amazing spectacle to witness			0

@entity5 was completely unaware of the whale as he paddled about
then the whale breached the water just feet away from him
from some 1200ft away it appeared mr @entity5 was riding the creature
a *scotsman* on holiday captured the strange encounter from his deck
