plans to make one of @entity3 's runways more than four miles long in a move campaigners say will cut night - time noise over @entity6 have gone on show to the public			1
the so - called ' @entity10 ' plans will see the northern runway at the west @entity6 terminal doubled in size and divided into two - with a 650 - metre ' safety zone ' in the middle - allowing planes to use either end at the same time			1
the proposal - which would see the @entity18 diverted into a tunnel beneath the super-sized landing strip - is an alternative to plans to build entirely new runways either at @entity3 or @entity25 airports			1
organisers of the third option - which say it could be finished by 2023 - have shown off their plans in an advert taken out in national newspapers over the past week			0
those behind the campaign say it would cut the noise of flights over @entity6 by shifting early morning flights to the new section of tarmac , meaning planes land and take off two and half miles further away from the capital			0
they claim the scheme would bring in the economic benefits of further airport expansion at a lower cost , requiring less land and with reduced disruption			0
former concorde pilot @entity64 , the leader of the @entity10 concept , said : ' our proposal would cost billions of pounds less than @entity3 's plan to build a third runway and the latest @entity71 report said it expects our expansion plan to boost the @entity74 economy by up to £ 214bn and to create as many as 163,000 new jobs nationwide – double the benefits offered by expanding @entity25			2
' as well as the huge runway , the scheme also includes plans for better rail access to the site			2
campaigners behind the plan say early morning flights could be shifted two miles west , meaning planes fly 800ft higher , thus reducing noise for west @entity6 residents living underneath the flight - path noise maps show how extended runways would mean the sound of planes would be less disruptive in built - up areas to the east of the airport the plans were unveiled to the public after the government 's airports ' tsar ' sir @entity95 , whose commission is evaluating the three schemes , warned all of them would cost more than they claim			1
his commission calculated that an entirely new runway to the north - west of @entity3 would cost around £ 18.6billion as opposed to @entity3 's estimate of £ 14.8billion			2
a new runway at @entity25 , estimated by @entity25 to cost £ 7.4billion , would cost an estimated £ 9.3billion			0
the third shortlisted option - an extension of the existing northern runway at @entity3 - would cost £ 13.5billion - higher than the £ 10.1billion estimated by @entity10			0
@entity113 will deliver his final report on which scheme should go ahead in summer 2015			0
organisers say early - morning flights will be told to land on the western end of the new runway , cutting noise to nearby homes in west @entity6 as well as plans for extending the runway , the ' @entity10 ' campaign wants to connect the airport to @entity128 rail link planned for the @entity74 the plan is being put forward by a consortium including former @entity131 pilot @entity64 , who says it would be cheaper than other plans			1

three competing schemes to boost airport capacity in @entity74 being looked at by a @entity137
two involve entirely new runways being built at @entity25 or @entity3 ; third involves extending @entity3 runway
plans for third scheme go on show to public ; with artists ' impressions showing the huge runway going over @entity18
campaigners say the scheme will reduce night - time noise over west @entity6 and be cheaper than other plans
