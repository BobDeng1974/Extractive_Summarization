by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 03:54 est , 25 may 2012 bank customers should be charged a monthly fee on current accounts even if they are in credit , according to a finance industry watchdog			1
charges of £ 15 a month could be applied , allowing a fixed number of cash machine withdrawals , direct debits , standing orders and cheques			1
any transactions beyond these caps would attract extra charges			0
the idea comes from @entity16 , executive director of the @entity17 and the chief executive - elect of the government 's @entity19 , set up to police the banks			1
free banking : @entity16 described it as a ' myth , ' as it distorts the supply of banking services he said up - front fees should form part of a radical shake - up of the current system in which the ' myth ' of free banking is perpetuated			1
he suggested that the fees would replace a regime of back - door charges which banks use to make money from ordinary customers			2
the fact that banks pay little or no interest on credit balances in current accounts amounts to a stealth charge decision makers : @entity16 , right , is pushing for an end to free banking in @entity47			1
chancellor @entity48 , left , faces a tough decision over whether he approves of the suggested charges separately , customers are stung with high interest rates and penalty charges on credit cards , loans and mortgages			2
mr @entity16 suggested one benefit of the fees would be that banks would be less inclined to rip off customers through the mis - selling of products and services such as payment protection insurance			2
@entity64 £ 8 @entity65 £ 12.95 ( £ 6 for 6 months ) @entity66 £ 6.50 @entity67 50 £ 10 @entity68 1,2,3 £ 2 @entity69 £ 9.95 @entity70 £ 10 * monthly charges in a speech to the @entity74 , he said it would be difficult for banks to introduce monthly charges ' without appearing to collude '			0
consequently , he said , the government or its agencies may need to take action			0
' it may require intervention in the public interest , not least because it is a way to encourage greater competition , ' he said			0
but @entity85 spokesman @entity84 mp said : ' it 's vital that @entity48 's new regulator is on the side of ordinary savers , who trust the banks with their money and allow the banks to use their deposits to make a profit to cover the costs of their accounts			0
' official customer body @entity98 said : ' what must n't happen is that consumers end up with the worst of both worlds – paying for accounts but still enduring unfair charges , opaque products , mis - selling and poor customer service			0
' which ? executive director @entity107 said : ' it 's a complete myth that banking is free now – consumers pay more than £ 9billion a year in fees and lost interest on their accounts			1
' the idea that if banks charged more , they would stop trying to mis - sell other financial products is completely unfounded			0

@entity17 chief *recommends* £ 15 per month fees for current accounts
cash machine charges and fees for direct debits and cheques also suggested
*critics* claim we already pay for banking through fines and lost interest
