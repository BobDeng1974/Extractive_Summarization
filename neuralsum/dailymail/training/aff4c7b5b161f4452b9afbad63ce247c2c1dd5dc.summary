by @entity0 shoppers at the budget retailer @entity2 may not be getting the bargains they expect			0
an investigation has revealed that the store ’s products are often labelled with apparently misleading prices			1
its success has been driven by the promise of designer items ‘ always up to 60 % less ’			1
but despite its motto of ‘ big labels , small prices ’ , price tags on some of the store ’s products are often inflated to make it appear as if they were originally sold for a higher price			1
false promise ? @entity22 department store @entity2 boasts of big labels at low prices at its 260 @entity26 branches the retailer ’s shelves also feature a number of products that appear to be by designer labels but are actually made by companies owned by @entity2			1
they are sold at supposedly reduced prices			1
the litany of seemingly misleading practices also includes allegations that some fashion brands make items to appear exclusively on the rails of the chain			1
the @entity22 department store is one of @entity26 ’s most prominent high street fashion outlets , with 260 branches across the country and growth of 11 per cent last year			1
even prince @entity48 has been a customer			0
in june , he was pictured leaving @entity2 ’s store in @entity50 , @entity51 , with a bag of bargains			2
royal approval : in june , prince @entity48 was pictured leaving @entity2 's store in @entity50 , @entity51 , with a bag of bargains the thousands of products in each store are normally advertised with a recommended retail price alongside the discounted one offered			1
but an investigation by @entity63 ’s dispatches has discovered a number of ways the retailer manipulates this labelling to make products more appealing to customers			2
in a possible breach of advertising rules , several examples were found of the retailer offering products with vastly exaggerated original selling prices			1
a coat by the luxury fashion brand @entity79 , for example , was advertised with an @entity80 of £ 2,225 , but the designer claimed the piece sold for £ 800			2
a former designer at the fashion giant @entity84 also revealed how the brand would produce items at a fraction of the cost for the retailer			1
@entity84 has since changed ownership , and the current brand owners say they have never made products for @entity2			2
@entity94 , of the @entity95 , said : ‘ if you want to rely on @entity80 when showing some price discount , you need to be confident that @entity80 really existed			0
‘ in other words , that your competitors are using that @entity80 and if they ’re not you should n’t be referring to that @entity80			0
because it is clearly misleading to refer to an @entity80 that nobody else is using			2
’ @entity2 said the @entity102 on products were established after conferring with suppliers			0
stores ‘ only cite an rrp which has been provided			0
independently by the third - party seller ’ , a spokesman added			0
the chain said a small fraction of its products were own label and that it was ‘ policy not to put @entity80 on own - brand products ’			0
any instances of original prices appearing were ‘ a product of human error ’			0
the spokesman said : ‘ we work closely with @entity95 to help us to do the right thing for our shoppers			0
no one is being misled			0
’ the own - label brands that appear in @entity2 stores include @entity126 and @entity127 of @entity128			0
