the video also shows him and his 15 supporters entering the @entity77 in @entity79 vehicles and then later unfurling a banner outside the mosque that said ' resistance '			0
it ends without any confrontation but uses an image of murdered soldier @entity86 , along with the message : ' the day @entity86 was murdered , thousands of patriots were born			0

' there is no place for vigilante patrols , @entity131 , @entity7 or any other faith , on the streets of @entity110			1
' a spokesman for the @entity44 called @entity13 ' neo-nazis '			1
' @entity13 ’s patrol does not represent @entity131 , just as @entity138 ’s patrols did not represent @entity7			1
