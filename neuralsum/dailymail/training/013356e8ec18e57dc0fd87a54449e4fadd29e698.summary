by @entity0 the cameraman who filmed @entity3 ’s final moments has spoken for the first time about the @entity3 ’s shocking death			1
@entity6 was in the water with @entity3 when he was killed by a stingray eight years ago and told how the sting ray stabbed his mate ‘ hundreds of times ’ , including one blow that punctured his heart			1
mr @entity6 , whom @entity3 described as his ‘ right - hand man , ’ said they were cruising in an inflatable boat off the coast of far north @entity18 looking for something to film for a documentary when they spotted the giant stingray			1
tragic end : @entity3 's cameraman and ' right - hand man ' @entity6 has shared what happened in the @entity3 's final moments they filmed the stingray , which measured eight feet across , for some time before they decided to get one last shot of @entity3 swimming up behind the animal			1
‘ all of a sudden it propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail , hundreds of strikes in a few seconds , ’ mr @entity6 told @entity34 ’s @entity33 programme			1
he said the stingray probably thought @entity3 ’s shadow was a tiger shark and acted to defend itself			2
mr @entity6 did not realise that anything was wrong with his friend at first , as he was filming the stingray swim away			1
‘ it was n’t until i panned the camera back [ and saw ] that @entity3 was standing in a huge pool of blood that i realised something had gone wrong			1
’ he managed to get the injured @entity3 back onto the boat , where he saw the extent of his injuries			0
he said the stingray had a ‘ jagged barb ’ which ‘ went through his chest like hot butter			0
’ ‘ he had a about a two - inch injury over his heart with blood - fluid coming out of it , ’ said mr @entity6			2
‘ he was in extraordinary pain			0
[ the stingrays ] have got venom on their barb , so i ’m sure it was excruciatingly painful			0
' hundreds of strikes ' : cameraman @entity6 demonstrated the stingray 's fatal blows the @entity73 pose for a family portrait before his death			1
from left : @entity77 , @entity3 , @entity78 and @entity79 ‘ even if we ’d been able to get him into an emergency ward at that moment , we probably would n’t have been able to save him because the damage to his heart was massive			2
' mr @entity6 , who has not spoken about the tragic death of his friend before , held back tears as he described mr @entity3 ’s last moments			1
‘ as we ’re motoring back , i ’m screaming at one of the other crew in the boat to put their hand over the wound and we ’re saying to him things like , “ think of your kids , @entity95 on , hang on , hang on			0
” ‘ he just sort of calmly looked up at me and said , “ i ’m dying			0
” and that was the last thing he said			0
’ mr @entity6 could not believe what had happened to his seemingly invincible best mate			2
‘ we thought he was going to live forever , ’ he said			0
‘ we hoped for a miracle , so i literally did cpr on him for over an hour before we got him to … the medics			0
’ but the @entity3 was pronounced dead by medics at the scene			0
mr @entity3 had a rule that his crew were to keep filming no matter who was injured and so the stingray ’s attack , the cpr on @entity3 and his death were all caught on camera			1
mr @entity6 insists he does not know where the footage is and believes it should never be aired out of respect for his family			0
‘ i do n't know what 's happened to it and i hope it would never see the light of day , ’ he said animal lovers : @entity127 has expressed the desire to continue her father 's work and announced last week that she will partnering with @entity131 the @entity3 tackled many dangerous animals during his life			2
he is pictured here during filming in @entity135 @entity3 's widow and children were in @entity138 last week , pictured , where @entity77 announced her controversial involvement with @entity131 as a youth ambassador			2
