by @entity0 they never found his body in the cloying , blood - drenched mud of the @entity4			1
but nearly a century after a young soldier died fighting for king and country , he is about to see service again			0
private @entity9 , who lied about his age to join the @entity11 at just 15 , is to be immortalised on a @entity13 stamp bearing his image			1
private @entity16 ' @entity15 is to be commemorated on a stamp marking the centenary of the @entity19 his photograph will form part of a five - year commemoration of the @entity19 , honouring the millions of ordinary people who gave their lives for freedom or answered the patriotic call			1
the stamp – first class , of course – is one of a series being issued ahead of the centenary of the outbreak of war this summer			1
it uses a portrait of the private in uniform , donated decades ago by his proud mother to the @entity41 so he would not be forgotten			1
the picture was taken a few days before he was killed and originally bore her poignant , handwritten note beneath : ‘ @entity45 … one of the very best			1
’ had she not labelled it so , few would surely remember the name of a young man whose sacrifice echoed that made by so many in ‘ the war to end all wars ’			0
@entity53 was only 15 when he signed up , convincing recruiting officers he was 18			0
he lived with his family in @entity56 , @entity57 , and joined the @entity58 in september 1914			0
by the time the 9th battalion was mobilised in @entity61 the following spring , the keen young infantryman would have found himself in the company of countless ‘ boy soldiers ’ who signed up as teenagers			2
over the top : around 1million soldiers were killed or wounded during the battle , 350,000 of them from the @entity69 @entity45 , along with thousands of other soldiers that day , was cut down while advancing on @entity72 lines they landed in @entity74 on may 31 and instantly found themselves thrust into battle			1
after three months they would also fight in the @entity78 , among the biggest confrontations of the campaign , in which 16,000 died and 25,000 were wounded among @entity69 troops alone			1
the regiment fought heroically in the @entity4 , a landscape stripped bare by artillery , tanks and ferocious fighting			1
perhaps unsurprisingly for a @entity88 named @entity9 , the private still managed a smile			2
in the last photograph of him , sent home to his mother , he is beaming with pride			2
shortly after she received it , in july 1916 , @entity95 was killed in a charge against @entity72 lines at @entity99			2
like scores of others , his body was swallowed by the mud and never traced			0
@entity104 never got over the loss of her beloved son but was determined he should be remembered			0
in 1920 she answered an appeal for photographs of the fallen and it eventually became part of an exhibition in honour of the dead			0
‘ i should like to feel i can tell my friends that he is there with all his comrades , ’ she wrote at the time			0
‘ he was only a boy but , @entity118 love him , he well did his duty			0
’ now his image will appear next to the @entity122 ’s head in a series that will also include stamps to commemorate war artists , and the role of women and civilians , among others			2
the stamps will be issued each year to 2018 , starting in july .			0
