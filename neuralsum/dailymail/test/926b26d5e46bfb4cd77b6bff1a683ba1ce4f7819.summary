the prime minister claimed he had been ' overcome by something ' , adding : ' it was just one of those things			0
' he said he had gone ' off script ' with the remark adding : ' i suppose it 's just the campaign			0
by the time you have made as many speeches as i have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth			0

he said : ' i had what @entity112 would describe as a brain fade – i do n't know what happened to me			0
i think i was overcome by something			0
but these things sometimes happen when you 're on the stump			0
' @entity123 said the gaffe exposed the prime minister as a ' phoney '			1

' i do n't go very often - in fact i have n't been for years and years - but i do try to keep up			0

' mr @entity0 's late uncle sir @entity97 was @entity6 's chairman from 1975 to 1982			1
reminded of his comment in 2001 in the @entity153 that he was n't actually a football fan , mr @entity0 said : ' i mean , i 'm not a regular attender , i used to play football as a kid , my son plays football , and i try and sort of keep up with what 's happening in the @entity161 and see how @entity6 are doing			1
' but when they get snug in the middle of the table i tend to sort of , i tend to back off a bit			0
when we get close to the bottom i get nervous , but i do n't know what happened			0
' mr @entity0 was asked to show his support for @entity6 by naming the year of the club 's famous @entity58 final victory in 1982			1
