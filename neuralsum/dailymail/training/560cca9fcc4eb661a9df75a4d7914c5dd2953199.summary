@entity2 has declared his intention to run for a fifth term as @entity1 president ' i 'd rather see more anger ( towards @entity1 ) than cynicism , ' @entity23 said			1
' if we 're going to change organisations like @entity1 , we 're going to have to put pressure on the stakeholders , put pressure on the sponsors , put pressure on the federations to demand change			2
' @entity1 was the most difficult assignment ( of my career ) and probably the most unsatisfactory			0
' i , at this point , do n't believe @entity1 will ever have enough credibility unless there is a change in leadership			1
' @entity1 has no plans at present to publish a report by former united states attorney @entity45 into the bidding process for the 2018 and @entity48 tournaments			0

governance expert @entity52 has called for a change in leadership at @entity1 ' i would like to see @entity1 release the report with appropriate protection for people 's privacy , ' @entity23 added			2
