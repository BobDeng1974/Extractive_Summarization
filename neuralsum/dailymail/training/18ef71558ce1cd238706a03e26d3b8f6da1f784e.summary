a virus gene that could be poisonous to humans has been missed when @entity3 food crops have been assessed for safety			1
@entity3 crops such as corn and soya , which are being grown around the world for both human and farm animal consumption , include the gene			1
a new study by the @entity15 's official food watchdog , the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , has revealed that the international approval process for @entity3 crops failed to identify the gene			1
a new study conducted by the @entity15 has shown that standard tests for @entity3 foods may be missing a potentially poisonous gene for humans as a result , watchdogs have not investigated its impact on human health and the plants themselves when assessing whether they were safe			1
the findings are particularly powerful because the work was carried out by independent experts , rather than @entity3 critics			1
it was led by @entity34 , who was employed by @entity12 , and @entity35 , of the @entity36 at the @entity37 in @entity38			0
they discovered that 54 of the 86 @entity3 plants approved for commercial growing and food in the @entity43 , including corn and soya , contain the viral gene , which is known as ' @entity47 '			1
in this country , these crops are typically fed to farm animals producing meat , milk and eggs			1
significantly , the @entity12 researchers concluded that the presence of segments of @entity47 ' might result in unintended phenotypic changes '			0
such changes include the creation of proteins that are toxic to humans			0
they could also trigger changes in the plants themselves , making them more vulnerable to pests			0
critics say the revelations make clear that the @entity3 approvals process , which has been in place for 20 years , is fatally flawed			1
they argue the only correct response is to recall all of the crops and food products involved			1
director of the campaigning group , @entity75 , @entity76 , said the discovery of the gene , ' totally undermines claims that @entity3 technology is safe , precise and predictable '			1
he said : ' this is a clear warning the @entity3 is not sufficiently understood to be considered safe			1
' authorisation for these crops must be suspended immediately , and they should be withdrawn from sale , until a full and extended review of their safety has been carried out			0
' typically , @entity3 crops are modified in the laboratory to give them resistance to being sprayed with powerful weed killers such as @entity94 's round - up			1
this means that , in theory , fields can be doused with the chemical , so wiping out the weeds and allowing the food plants to thrive			2
it was previously assumed that virus genes are not present in plants once they are grown in the field and reach consumers , however it is now clear that this is not the case the modification process involves inserting genes into the plants using a technique that allows them to piggyback on viruses that are commonly found in the soil and plants			2
it has been assumed that virus genes are not present in the plant once it is grown in the field and reaches consumers , however it is now clear that this is not the case			0
a review of the @entity12 research in @entity126 said the presence of the viral gene appears to have been missed by biotech companies , universities and government regulators			2
' this situation represents a complete and catastrophic system failure , ' it said			0
' there are clear indications that this viral gene might not be safe for human consumption			0
it also may disturb the normal functioning of crops , including their natural pest resistance			0
' a reasonable concern is that the protein produced by @entity144 might be a human toxin			2
this is a question that can only be answered by future experiments			0
' biotech supporters argue that there is no evidence from countries such as the @entity43 that eating @entity3 food causes any harm			1
however , the reality is that no health monitoring has taken place to establish this			0
the findings will embarrass the government and the food and farming secretary , @entity161 , who has embarked on a @entity164 propaganda exercise designed to win over sceptical consumers			0
mr @entity161 recently rejected public concerns as ' humbug ' and ' complete nonsense '			0
policy director at the @entity170 , @entity171 said : ' for years , @entity3 companies have made a deliberate and chilling effort to stop independent scientists from looking at their products			2
' this is what happens when there is a complete absence of independent scrutiny of their @entity3 crops			2
' biotech firms are represented by the @entity183 ( @entity183 )			0
its chairman , dr @entity184 , said the @entity12 study was one small part of a strict and complex scrutiny process			0
he said : ' over the past 25 years , the @entity189 has funded more than 130 research projects involving 500 independent research groups which have found no higher risks to the environment or food chain from @entity3 crops than from conventional plants and organisms			1
' furthermore , nearly three trillion meals containing @entity3 ingredients have been eaten without a single substantiated case of ill - health			2
the combination of these two facts can give consumers a huge amount of confidence in the safety of @entity3 crops			2
' @entity3 critics and @entity12 are at odds over the implications of the research paper , which was written by the deputy chairman of the organisation ’s advisory panel on the issue and a former senior member of staff			0
@entity12 insists that the research highlighting the presence of @entity144 does not represent a new discovery of a viral gene and does not indicate a safety concern about @entity3 crops already approved			1
it said the viral gene ‘ can not infect animals or humans and therefore presents no threat to human or animal health ’			0
this is challenged by @entity3 critics who say there is no research evidence to justify this statement .			1

@entity15 watchdog reveals approval for @entity3 foods fails to identify poisonous gene
54 of the 86 @entity3 plants approved contain the *dangerous* gene
@entity144 found in food for farm animals producing meat , milk and eggs
biotech supporters argue there is no evidence that @entity3 foods are harmful
