he is one of the gaal - acticos now , a constellation of stars @entity5 ’s manager must align to bring the glory days back to @entity7			1
but there have been times in the past eight months when @entity10 feared he might never play at the highest level again			1
when @entity10 , 28 , ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a @entity16 game in january , it soon became clear that the he would miss the @entity17			1
it has not been an easy road to recovery			0
however , a week that began with him flying to @entity40 on a private jet to tie up a deadline - day move to @entity43 ’s @entity5 ended with @entity10 making his international comeback against the @entity45 in @entity46 on friday			1
it was only for the last 13 minutes of a 1 - 0 defeat but this is @entity10 after all			2
the man they call @entity10			2
while his team - mates — @entity53 ’s new £ 71m signing @entity54 apart — warranted only passing interest from the waiting media , @entity10 emerged from the dressing room at the @entity58 to an explosion of flashbulbs			2
@entity10 : @entity10 came on for the final thirteen minutes of his country 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity27 on friday evening comeback : @entity10 admitted he was nervous playing for his country again following his eight month lay - off plenty to smile about : @entity10 says he is feeling spectacular and hopes to show he is still at the top level ‘ i ’m so happy to be back and to have this opportunity life has granted me after the injury , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m excited about being able to join @entity5			2
i hope to score a lot of goals for them — that is something i have done everywhere i have played			0
‘ because of the injury i felt so nervous before this game , almost like it was my first time with the national team			0
i expect it will be the same before i play my first game for @entity5			2
all smiles : @entity10 joined @entity5 from @entity26 ‘ physically i feel spectacular			1
i have been able to play without any kind of trouble whatever			0
throughout my rehab people have given me so much support and sent me so many kind messages			0
i want to thank them by giving them as much happiness as possible			0
as time passes and i get into game shape , i believe i will show i ’m still at the top level			1
’ @entity10 ’s injury made for a rigorous medical at @entity5 ’s @entity93 training centre on monday night before his move was confirmed some considerable time after the transfer deadline had passed			1
now he is determined to justify the massive expense they have gone to by bringing him to @entity100 football ; more than £ 20million for one season if you factor in his £ 280,000 - a - week ages on top of the £ 5m loan fee from @entity26			1
the transfer fee will be about £ 51.3m next summer should @entity108 want to keep @entity10 at @entity5 alongside @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
the former @entity114 and @entity115 star knows what he is getting into			0
he understands his new club ’s fall from grace and the fact that they have spent £ 150m this summer trying to put it right			0
‘ it is a dream come true to play for such a great and famous club , ’ he said			0
‘ to bring the good times back is what we all want and i will work extra hard to do that			0
@entity5 are an historic club , one of the three best clubs in the world			2
they ’ve made me feel very important in this new project and i ’m very pleased and happy to have joined them			0
‘ there has been too much speculation about other clubs but that ’s in the past now and i ’ve chosen to join @entity5			0
going there was always in my best interests			0
’ dream come true : @entity10 chats with @entity5 's assistant manager shortly after joining the @entity141 the striker was pictured celebrating with his agent @entity143 and other advisors with a glass of wine in a city centre @entity148 restaurant in the early hours of the morning before joining his @entity21 team - mates in @entity46 , where he also applied for a visa at the @entity153 consulate on thursday			1
with everything that had gone on , coach @entity154 chose to name @entity10 on the bench after he had been out through an hour - long training session at the team hotel on friday			1
it was probably a wise decision considering @entity21 and @entity27 wasted no time re-opening the hostilities that blighted their @entity22 meeting			1
with @entity10 hoping to make his @entity5 debut at home to @entity164 a week today , @entity108 will be grateful he was kept out of the firing line for 77 minutes before replacing @entity54			2
new arrival : @entity10 will be hoping to make his @entity5 debut against @entity164 a week on sunday @entity168 : @entity5 manager @entity43 will be pleased @entity10 was used sparingly by @entity21 the build - up of excitement that started when he took his place on the bench before kick - off reached a crescendo when the no 9 went up on the board			1
a couple of final warm - up exercises in front of the dugout and @entity10 was back			2
it all went a bit flat after that			0
@entity184 claimed @entity27 ’s winner six minutes later and @entity10 ’s only notable contribution was to head a close - range chance over the bar			1
united fans will expect more for their money when @entity10 lands in @entity100 today			0
@entity10 is desperate to deliver .			0
