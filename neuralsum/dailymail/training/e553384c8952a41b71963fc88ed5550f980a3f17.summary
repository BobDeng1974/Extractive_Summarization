by @entity0 published : 08:57 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 30 august 2013 these stunning photographs , selected for the @entity3 ’s latest exhibition , highlight the incredible beauty of scientific research			1
the sensational images come from various disciplines of science and highlight how important photography is for academics			1
the photographs form a dazzling display of the world ’s best scientific photography going on show to the public			1
stunning photographs from the prestigious @entity3 's latest exhibition prove that science and beauty can co-exist			1
this image is a polarised light micrograph of a sample of ocean jasper by @entity24			2
this volcanic ' ocean jasper ' is found only in @entity26 and is highly prized among collectors			0
here a thin section of rock just 30 micrometres thick has been polished and polarised light shone through it			0
a second polarising filter reveals these amazing colours the @entity3 ’s @entity35 exhibition showcases works from 54 scientists from around the world			1
photography skills play a crucial role in medicine , forensic science , engineering , archaeology , oceanography , natural history and many more areas			1
the exhibition celebrates the use of photography in science and shows that academia and beauty can collide			1
among the highlights is a fascinating close - up of a doliolid , a microscopic marine animal photographed by @entity59 marine expert dr @entity58			1
@entity61 and @entity62 penguins on an ice floe near @entity64 in the @entity65 by @entity66			0
the photographer observed them pushing each other off the floe and swimming in the water as if playing a game of tag extreme close - up view of the head of a @entity76 by @entity77			1
many species build their nests on human habitation , while not normally aggressive paper wasps will defend their nests vigorously			1
this image is part of a series investigating our often - overlooked housemates another star of the show is a jellyfish imaged using x-rays in a @entity93 scanner by @entity94 of the @entity96 ’s @entity95			2
other subjects include a human lymphocyte cell , the head of a weevil , a mouse embryo and blood cells inside a blood vessel			1
dr @entity104 , director general of the @entity3 , said : ' the society was founded in 1853 to promote the art and science of photography and we ’ve have been doing just that ever since			1
‘ we held the first @entity35 exhibition in 2011 and it went down extremely well			1
' @entity112 found on front porch doormat by @entity77			0
there are over 40,000 species of true weevils in the family @entity119 , beetle - like creatures typified by a long snout and clubbed antennae scanning electron micrograph of nanoswimmers on the beach by @entity125 , @entity126			0
these are microscopic objects being investigated for use as drug carriers in medicine			0
each tiny coil is just 25 micrometres long , 5 micrometres wide and 300 nanometres thick extreme close - up view of the head of a cuckoo wasp by @entity77			2
common names also include jewel wasp , gold wasp or emerald wasp , reflecting their brilliantly coloured , metal - like bodies a human lymphocyte cell by @entity141			1
these natural killer lymphocyte cells are a part of the immune system and play a major role in defending the host from both tumors and virally - infected cells ‘ the 2013 show builds on that success and takes it to a new level , ' added dr @entity104			1
‘ photography and specialised imaging techniques continue to play an essential role for scientists			2
‘ these images have been used to support scientific research or medical diagnosis , to illustrate learned papers and presentations , to show the places in which science is undertaken , or simply to represent the beauty that exists in the natural world and in worlds that are normally invisible to the wider public			0
‘ some of these images look something out of science fiction but they come from the everyday world we live in			0
‘ the exhibition is a real visual feast			2
’ the left image shows the collision of two water droplets beneath a bursting soap bubble by @entity181 , @entity182			0
the image was captured using a @entity185 slr camera and a xenon flash unit with an exposure time of 9 microseconds			0
the right image unique fishbone pattern is created by two colliding steams of liquids by @entity192			0
the pattern is currently the focus of scientists studying the strange world of fluid dynamics coloured scanning electron micrograph of a @entity199 holding a gear from a icromechanical device by @entity202			0
the gear is about 0.1mm wide light micrograph of the adult doliolid doliolum nationalis by dr @entity58 , @entity205			0
this 1.5 mm long , adult doliolid possesses bands of muscle around its barrel - shaped body that help it swim and feed as it drifts among the plankton at the sea surface the application of photography to science is almost as old as photography itself			2
as early as 1872 , @entity218 , a @entity219 - born photographer , used photography to study and analyse motion in horses			1
since then , by using invisible radiation , new techniques and methods of photography have arisen			2
this has happened , for example , through sophisticated scientific instruments such as fibre optics , endoscopes , microscopes , telescopes , stereo microscopes and ophthalmoscopes			0
coloured scanning electron micrograph showing red and white blood cells inside a small blood vessel by @entity239 , @entity240			1
the sample was prepared by freeze fracturing , rapidly freezing the sample with liquid nitrogen such that tissues are instantly preserved			0
if the sample is broken , the inner structures are revealed			0
in this frame , a tiny vein , or venule , has been opened to show the blood cells inside human cortical neurons with interconnecting dendrites , 4,200x by @entity141			1
cortical neurons make up the brain 's cortex which in part makes up the cerebral cortex , responsible for memory , attention , perceptual awareness , thought , language , and consciousness 3d reconstruction of a glass model of a jellyfish , imaged using x-rays in a @entity93 scanner by @entity94 , @entity96			2
the artificial colours used here are based on the density of the glass			0
this incredible model was sculpted in glass in the mid- 19th century by @entity274 and @entity275			0
the techniques used by this father and son team are not fully understood , it is hoped that this study will help reveal some of their secrets ‘ gone are the days when we were restricted to 1000 @entity288 emulsion sensitivity , ’ said dr @entity283 , exhibition co-ordinator			2
‘ today , dslr cameras with full frame sensors have the ability to process images that reduce noise in low light conditions			0
we have ccd sensors , sensitive to much higher @entity288 sensitivities which can yield usable images			0
‘ we used to say that , “ if you can see it , it can be photographed ” and now we say , “ even if you can not see it , we most likely can photograph it ”			0
’ the @entity35 exhibition launches at the @entity304 in @entity305 , @entity306 , tomorrow			1
it will then go on a tour of the @entity219 from october 1 before heading to @entity309			1
a porcelain crab feeding inside the safety of its host @entity313 coral branches by @entity315 from @entity316			2
it is lit by the bright green fluorescence of the coral			0
these are normally very shy creatures and are difficult to photograph light micrograph of a mouse embryo , approximately 10.5 days post-fertilisation by @entity322			1
the specimen was stained with a fluorescent marker that highlights the presence of precursor cells to nerve tissue then chemically treated to make it optically transparent			1
it was scanned using @entity332 to produce a series of optical ëslicesí that were combined to generate a virtual 3d model of the embryo triple exposure image showing a seed falling from a @entity340 tree by @entity341 , @entity342			2
this image was created in three exposures ; the first with flash to show the leaves and seeds , the next a half - second exposure showing the spiralling fall and the last a flash exposure to freeze the seed at the bottom of its descent			0

photography is part of the @entity35 exhibition which launches in @entity306 tomorrow
highlights include a human lymphocyte cell , the head of a weevil , a mouse embryo and cells inside a blood vessel
the exhibition , by the @entity3 , will go on a @entity219 from october 1 before heading to @entity309
