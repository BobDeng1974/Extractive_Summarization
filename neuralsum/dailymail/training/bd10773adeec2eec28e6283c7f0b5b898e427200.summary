@entity1 @entity0 considered this morning lifting the ban on congressional earmarks that allow federal lawmakers to direct certain contracts , projects and ' pork ' spending to their home districts			1
as it currently stands , no earmarks of any kind can be tacked onto legislation that originates in the @entity1 or the @entity13 , with both chambers having banned the targeted appropriations several years ago in the name of fiscal responsibility			2
@entity19 rep. @entity18 wanted the @entity1 to make an exception to the moratorium for the next @entity22 for ' state , locality ( including county and city governments ) , or a public utility or other public entity			1
' but @entity1 speaker @entity31 was able to talk his caucus out of it , a source familiar with the proceedings told @entity33			1
congressman @entity18 , right , lead a behind the scenes effort at today 's @entity35 rules meeting to get the ban on congressional earmarks lifted so that members can again bring home the bacon by directing federal spending to their home districts but @entity1 speaker @entity31 , right , talked his caucus out of it @entity31 spoke in opposition to @entity18 amendment during the meeting , the source said , and it was successfully defeated			1
@entity22 banned earmarks , in part , to curb abuse by lawmakers who would hold government projects hostage in order to force their colleagues to vote their way their way on certain pieces of legislation			2
the process also led to wasteful spending , including on the infamous @entity61 in @entity62			0
the way @entity18 and other lawmakers who want the ban lifted see it , however , federal funds are either going to be appropriated by the legislative branch or the @entity70 administration , so @entity22 may as well take back the reigns			1
' i do not believe most people trust how president @entity70 spends our tax dollars , ' @entity18 told @entity33 in an email today			0
' this proposal would allow the conservative , @entity0 - controlled @entity1 to reassert its @entity79 authority over the @entity80 and the spending decisions it is currently making			2
' @entity1 @entity0 discussed the measure in a closed - door rules meeting and made the decision via secret ballot			1
given that @entity35 controls a majority of seats in the lower chamber , any action by @entity0 this morning would have led to an official lifting of the ban on certain types of earmarks in the @entity1 , and potentially in the @entity13 , where senior @entity94 have been trying revive the measure since last summer			1
like @entity18 , senate majority leader @entity96 believes the earmark ban has reallocated at spending power meant for the legislature to the executive branch and he would like to see it given back to lawmakers			0
' i have never backed down from my support of congressionally directed spending , ' @entity96 told the @entity106 in june			0
' that 's our constitutional obligation and duty			0
i do not believe that the @entity1 should make all these decisions			2
i am proud of all the earmarks i have gotten for the state of @entity113			0
they 'll come back - it 's only a question of time because that 's our constitutional obligation			0
' at the time @entity96 claimed that ' a very senior member of the @entity1 @entity0 caucus ' also wanted to see the restriction rolled back but he did not say who			1
@entity31 's efforts to save the ban today signal that it was not him , however .			0
