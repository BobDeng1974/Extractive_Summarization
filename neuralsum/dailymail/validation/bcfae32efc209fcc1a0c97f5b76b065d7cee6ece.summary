some say that certain people ca n’t see the forest for the trees			0
but a skier in @entity6 , @entity4 proved that you ca n’t always see the trees for the ski slope either after one appeared to come out of nowhere and wipe him out on a mountain			1
videoed skiing towards a slight lip in the piste , the skier gets a remarkable amount of air as he propels himself into a forward flip			0
but as quickly as the footage begins looking impressive , it begins looking painful as he ploughs straight into a tree upon landing			0
the failed stunt is repeated twice more in slow motion , which shows in greater detail the moment the man spots the tree and braces for impact			1
crashing into it , the tree ’s branches sway violently and its entire dusting of snow disappears into the atmosphere			2
the skier approaches a slight gradient in the slope before he jumps up into the air to attempt a foward flip a close up shot of the man in the tree shows how tangled within it he is as one of his skis looks genuinely stuck			1
he looks relatively okay however considering the force in which he collides with it			0
the clip concludes with a doctor at the hospital utilising a rather ingenious app that translates his @entity4 into @entity49			0
hurtling through the air the skier gains a surprising amount of height and initially appears to be pulling off an impressive flip he asks the man : ‘ are you dizzy ? ’ to which he replies with a nod , circling his face with his hand as if to indicate where he is feeling pain			1
the doctor , now sitting in front of what seem to be x-rays of the man ’s skull , then appears to say : ‘ three days ’			2
perhaps suggesting the amount of time the man should refrain from skiing for			0
the man realises his mistake while hurtling through the air and braces himself for the impact of the crash while not an obvious place to ski , @entity4 has some 600 ski resorts and some impressive sites including @entity79 , known for its international clientele			1
@entity4 slopes are not as steep as some of the better known places to ski , but they are generally much cheaper to enjoy			2
and because of the lack of tourism to the skiing areas , they are sometimes occupied by only a handful of people			0
watch out for that ... the man crashes into the tree and becomes tangled within it as its branches sway violently			1

@entity98 attempts impressive front flip and hurtles through the air
before spotting a tree , bracing himself for impact and crashing into it
close - ups show the man tangled in its branches but he appears okay
the video was captured on a ski slope in @entity6 , @entity4
