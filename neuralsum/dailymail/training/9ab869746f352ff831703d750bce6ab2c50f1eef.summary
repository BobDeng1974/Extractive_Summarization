in the end , @entity1 ’s joke about the @entity2 turned out to be an insult to the @entity2			1
the plan was to keep @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 quiet for just long enough to give @entity9 a chance to progress into the last 16 of the @entity11			1
the reality is that this team can not keep a clean sheet when it really matters			0
matchday six , at @entity15 , was win or bust			0
the lights are out on @entity9 ’s @entity11 dream and it will take a special person to solve the problems in this defence			1
that ’s their longest run in the competition since november 2008			2
@entity42 scored here at @entity15 because you always knew that they were going to score			0
@entity9 conceded in all six group games : ‘ we just were n’t good enough , ’ admitted @entity46			1
in the aftermath , their gutsy second half performance is worth recording , but the brutal truth is that this team was pretty much done when @entity6 scored a beaut in the 25th minute			0
@entity46 admitted it was time to go back to basic when they conceded three at @entity55 on november 23			2
after this it is very much back to the beginning			2
if this is what £ 64million gets you these days then let ’s hope @entity9 have kept the receipt			1
they are damaged , possibly beyond repair			0
where is the guidance ? who is marking who ? who is the leader in that back line ? no - one can really say for sure			1
@entity59 was once again shaky between the sticks , but clings on under pressure @entity62 desperately clears his lines under pressure from @entity81 @entity46 looks glum on the sidelines as @entity9 fall at the first @entity11 hurdle @entity85 trudges off at half - time with @entity9 a goal down and staring down the barrel @entity9 are out because in six group games - home and away against @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity42 - there is n’t a single player in their defence taking responsibility for marking and positioning when they are in or out of possession			1
‘ we have to be better , it ’s simple , ’ added @entity46			2
amazingly , when they were forced to play three at the back after the dismissal of substitute @entity32 , there was a smidgen of improvement			2
the confidence has been drained from this @entity9 team and it has come to the stage where their credibility as top class players is being tested to the limit			1
@entity15 is no place to hide			0
they have witnessed some of the great defenders over the years , from @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 to @entity120 , walk through the @entity15			0
the current group , including substitute @entity122 , do not belong in that category			0
using the surprise absence of @entity125 , a @entity11 finalist with @entity126 in 2006 , as a reason for @entity9 ’s exit is stretching the imagination a little bit too far			1
@entity117 salutes the @entity131 after @entity9 reach the 1978 @entity11 final @entity116 tackles @entity133 of @entity134 during 1983 's @entity135 final win the warning signs were there when @entity9 conceded 51 times on the way to finishing second in the @entity143 last season			1
part of the answer was to spend £ 24m on @entity30 and the poor fella has been an unmitigated disaster since his move from @entity149			2
to think @entity151 manager @entity150 once paid £ 20m for @entity152 a few weeks after @entity153 won the @entity11 in 2004			0
for that they got the finished article			0
@entity30 was booked , inevitably , in the second half when he shoved @entity8 in the back just as the @entity26 winger was combing through @entity9 ’s midfield			1
his first half performance was just as baffling and heaven knows what he was thinking in the opening minute when he demanded the ball from his keeper on the edge of the area			0
he ’s not good enough for that			0
over the next four days this @entity9 defence will need to address some fairly serious issues before they head on to their next fixture at @entity172 against the @entity173			1
as for the rest , it ’s just pub talk .			0

when they needed *composure* , @entity9 's defence set a nervy tone
where is the guidance ? who is marking who ? who is the leader in that back line ?
if that ’s what £ 64million gets you these days then let ’s hope that @entity9 kept the receipt
there is *n't* a single player in that @entity9 defence taking responsibility for marking and positioning
