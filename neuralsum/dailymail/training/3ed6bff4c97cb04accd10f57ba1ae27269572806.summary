police have found a sizable piece of one of the engines from a plane that crashed into the @entity5 , more than 11 years after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks			1
the piece of landing gear was found wedged between two buildings just blocks from @entity10 - in between the buildings at 51 @entity12 and 50 @entity13 in downtown @entity14			1
the location is particularly noteworthy because 51 @entity12 is the site of the @entity16 that stirred up controversy and months of protests two years ago when the site developers wanted to turn it into a mosque			0
in a press conference that took place across the street about 30 minutes later , @entity34 told reporters that wednesday surveyors were working in the narrow space when they came across an unidentified mechanical part			1
police received a report about the discovery , but officers who responded were not sure what the large piece of metal was resting in a very confined space littered with debris			0
@entity34 then showed reporters a hand - drawn diagram of the scene made on a small piece of paper			1
a short time later , the @entity62 , the @entity63 and the @entity64 were notified			0
pilots who were consulted ruled that the large piece of steel measuring 5 feet by 4 feet by 17 inches at one time was part of a plane ’s landing gear			1
mystery : commissioner @entity34 ( pictured ) told reporters a rope was wrapped around the gear and that aspect of the find would be investigated some answers : officials held a press conference in front of the buildings ( pictured ) where the gear was found @entity34 said that mechanical part was wedged in narrow space measuring about 18 inches , and according to @entity34 , a rope could be seen intertwined with the steel			1
police officers cordoned off the section of @entity12 surrounding the site of the discovery located inside a former @entity93 department store , which was controversially turned into an @entity16 center and mosque just blocks away from the @entity10			1
@entity97 deputy commissioner @entity96 told @entity99 radio friday afternoon , ' no , it has not been known that its been there , ' @entity101 said , denying that the building owners were aware that their back alley contained a piece of evidence from the 2001 terrorist attack			1
' it was just only recently observed because it 's wedged between a very narrow space between the rears of two buildings that almost touch			0
' @entity34 said that the investigation will look at the possibility that the part had been somehow lowered down into the narrow space			0
the gear has a serial number visible next to the word ‘ @entity116			0
’ it is unclear which of the two planes the new - found part belonged to , as both were @entity116 aircrafts			2
@entity34 said that on monday , the medical examiner will investigate to determine if there are any human remains at the site , and it will then be determined how to move the plane remnants			1
intact : the gear found mere blocks from @entity10 , bears a clear @entity131 mark ‘ it ’s a manifestation of a horrific terrorist act , ’ @entity34 said , adding that this latest discovery may bring up difficult memories for the families of the victims			1
@entity138 , 63 , a construction worker with @entity139 , has been working on the yet - to - be completed @entity140 just a few blocks away			0
on friday , he was sitting on a bench in his red work helmet just steps away from the mosque building , next door to the @entity147 bar , when he says police officers converged on the area			0
‘ it ’s an amazing situation , ’ @entity138 said of the discovery made nearly 12 years after the 9/11 attacks			0
the 63 - year - ld construction worker , who lives in @entity155 , came to @entity10 a week after the tragedy and joined the massive cleanup effort hauling away debris			2
speaking to @entity159 , @entity138 said he is not surprised by the find			0
5 - feet : the chunk found wednesday was 5 - feet long and police say they 've secured the area , pictured , ' like a crime scene ' the inspectors were the ones to call police and since that call , the @entity97 has secured the scene as if it were a crime scene in order to document it and catalog evidence			1
' we 're going to treat this as a crime scene for the next week at least , ' @entity101 said			1
' the medical examiner is an important part of the investigation to first see if there 's any contamination of the soil that makes it any health safety on the soil below it on the ground			0
and then they will then make a determination , the office of the medical examiner , as to whether to sift for any possible human remains that might be associated with this find , ' @entity101 said			2
today 's discovery of the sizable portion of a plane fuselage is not the first time that evidence from the tragic day were found on the streets of lower @entity14			1
in previous years , large pieces from @entity198 ’s jet engines were found blocks away from where the planes crashed into the @entity5 on september 11 , 2001			2
those pieces , along with a 31 - foot section of the broadcast antenna from the @entity5 's @entity204 were shown as part of an @entity62 evidence exhibit that ran at @entity208 's @entity207 through 2012			2
a 10,000 pound elevator motor was also taken from the ruins and has become part of another exhibit at the @entity213 at @entity10			0
small artifacts , like countless cell phones and even tinier human remains continue to be uncovered			2
about 60 truckloads of debris that could contain tiny fragments of bone or tissue were unearthed by construction crews that have been working on the new @entity5 in recent years			0
debris : large chunks of engine from @entity198 ( left ) were found blocks from @entity10 and a 31 - foot piece of the @entity204 's broadcast antennae ( right ) were displayed at @entity208 's @entity207 until 2012 around 9,000 pieces of human remains too degraded for dna matching have so far been found			1
more than 1.6 million tons of materials were moved from @entity10 to the fresh kills landfill on @entity234 , and family members of some victims later sued saying the debris could contain human remains			1
the lawsuit was dismissed by the @entity241 @entity240 in 2008			0
new sifting efforts this month , the first since 2010 , have so far uncovered at least 6 potential human remains from debris transported to a park atop the @entity234 landfill			2
some 2,750 people died at the @entity5 in the 2001 attacks , but only 1,634 people have been identified			0
some degree of closure came for dozens of families as 34 new positive identifications of victims have been found since 2006 .			0

police say the 5 - foot piece of landing gear from one of the planes was found wednesday lodged in a tiny alley just blocks from @entity10
area is being treated like a crime scene and commissioner @entity265 told reporters the gear had a rope wrapped around it and may could have been lowered into the 18 - inch *gap*
@entity271 will determine whether or not they search for human remains in the alley between the two lower @entity14 buildings
