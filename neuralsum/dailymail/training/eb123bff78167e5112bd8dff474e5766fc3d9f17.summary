dinosaurs living around 100 million years ago may have experienced acid trips after eating grass infected by a fungus similar to the species used to create lsd			1
palaeobiologists have discovered the earliest specimen of grass ever found trapped inside a piece of amber dug from a mine in the mountains of northern @entity12			1
when they examined the grass , however , they found the tips were infected with a fungus that is thought to be similar to @entity15 , a group of fungi that grow on rye and wheat			1
the tip of this grass spiklet , encased in amber 100 million years ago , is covered by a fungus similar to ergot compounds produced by ergot fungi , or @entity15 , can be hallucinogenic and were used by scientists to synthesis the powerful drug lsd that became popular in the 1960s			1
researchers who identified the fungus say that giant herbivorous dinosaurs living at the time would probably have eaten large amounts of this fungus			1
opium , magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years			0
an anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood - altering substances since the @entity42			2
professor @entity43 has compiled evidence from around the world that @entity47 people were taking drugs derived from cacti in @entity50 and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around @entity52			0
researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in @entity57 on @entity58 in the southern @entity59 , which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant			1
it is still chewed through out much of @entity63 as a mild stimulant			0
charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the bronze age @entity68 culture that appeared in @entity70 around @entity71			2
dr @entity72 , palaeobiologist at @entity73 who helped conduct the research , said : ' there 's no doubt in my mind that it would have been eaten by sauropod dinosaurs , although we ca n't know what exact effect it had on them			2
' there is a good possibility that some of the chemical compounds found in the fossil were hallucinogenic			1
' it seems like ergot has been involved with animals and humans almost forever , and now we know that this fungus dates back to the earliest evolution of grasses			1
' this is an important discovery that helps us understand the timeline of grass development , which now forms the basis of the human food supply in such crops as corn , rice or wheat			0
' but it also shows that this parasitic fungus may have been around almost as long as the grasses themselves , as both a toxin and natural hallucinogen			0
' according to the analysis , which is published in the journal @entity116 , the fossilised grass grew between 97 - 110 million years ago			0
at this time - the middle of the @entity118 period - the land was dominated by large dinosaurs and conifers			0
however , it is around this time that the earliest flowering plants , grasses and small mammals were beginning to evolve			0
trapped inside the amber - which is formed from fossilised tree resin - is the spikelet from the tip of one of these early grasses			2
ergot now infects crops like rye ( seen on the left ) but scientists found a similar fungus on the fossil of a grass that grew 100 million years ago ( right ) , suggesting the hallucinogenic fungi evolved with the early grasses the ergot fungi @entity142 , pictured above , produces compounds that have been used to make a range of medicines but was also used by scientists to synthesis the powerful hallucinogenic drug @entity147 dr @entity72 and his colleagues from the @entity151 and @entity152 found growing on the spikelet was also a now extinct fungus			1
named @entity157 parasiticus , it is similar tothe @entity15 fungus that infects grass crops like rye and wheat around the world			1
claviceps contain compounds called ergotamine , which can be converted into lysergic acid , which can be hallucinogenic			0
some species of ergot also contain large amounts of lysergic acid itself			0
scientists used ergotamine and lysergic acid to synthesis lysergic acid diethylamide , or @entity147			1
the researchers speculate that @entity177 and its relation @entity178 may actually have been helpful to grasses by helping them to repel herbivores			0
the fungus is extremely bitter and can cause delirium , convulsions and severe pain			2
@entity147 , pictured as a powder above , is a powerful psychedelic drug that was first sythesised from lysergic acid obtained from the ergot fungus but the hallucinogen was declared illegal in the @entity190 in 1966 and the @entity191 in 1971 in cattle is causes a disease called @entity194 staggers while in the middle ages it is known to have killed thousands of people who ate infected rye bread			1
more than 1,000 compounds have been extracted or derived from the fungus , with many of them becoming valuable drugs			2
@entity204 , for example , is a vasodilator and has been used in the past to control bleeding after childbirth and induce abortions			0
writing in the journal the researchers said : ' few fungi have had a greater historical impact on society than ergot			2
' a flesh - eating plant that grew in @entity216 about 40 million years ago is thought to be one of the earliest examples of predatory plants to be found			2
the fossil was discovered perfectly preserved in amber , showing its leaves that are strewn with multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs			1
the new species was dug out of a mine near @entity227 on the @entity228 and is believed to be related to the ' flypaper trap ' plant @entity230 , found in the southwestern @entity231			1
@entity230 catches small prey - largely insects - with its leaves that are covered in an extremely sticky glue produced by the glands or tentacles			0
like @entity230 , the @entity216 plant 's leaves show evidence of different sized tentacles with which it would have captured prey and smothered it in slime before releasing digestive enzymes			0
the tentacles , as well as the glands on the leaf surface , absorb the nutrients from the prey .			0

palaeobiologists say the fossil is the earliest specimen of grass ever found
the grass was discovered encased in amber dug from a mine in @entity12
scientists found the grass tip was infected by a fungus similar to ergot
ergot produces compounds that can induce delirium and hallucinations
scientists in the 20th century used these compounds to synthesise @entity147
researchers say herbivorous dinosaurs are likely to have eaten the fungus
however it is not known if the dinosaurs would have suffered *hallicinations*
