when @entity2 's 18 - month - old daughter @entity1 refused to wear pink frilly knickers , instead insisting upon @entity5 pants , she put it down to her being a bit of a tomboy , simply less girly than her three sisters			1
but as @entity1 grew older and continued squirming in dresses , playing only with cars and actually insisting she was a boy - even cutting her blonde hair short at the age of five - @entity2 , 48 , a hairdresser from @entity15 , @entity16 , wondered if this was more than just a phase			1
and when , at the age of nine , @entity1 said , ' you 're not taking me seriously ! i do n't want to be a girl anymore ! ' , @entity2 knew something had to change			1
but when her son , who changed his name to @entity27 by deed poll at the age of 11 , stood up to them and defended his mother , even they could see the family were all completely serious			1
@entity27 is now one of @entity46 's youngest people with gender dysphoria , a condition whereby you feel have been physically assigned the wrong gender at birth			1
' i knew when i was pregnant with @entity27 that something was different , ' @entity2 told @entity54 and @entity55 on @entity57 's @entity56 today			1
' i 've been pregnant with three other girls and this one was completely new			0
i was so horribly sick all the way through			0
i was just certain i was having a boy			0
' but having never heard the word ' transgender ' , @entity2 was at a loss as to how to act , and simply lived day by day , letting @entity27 be their guide			1
social services once visited the family 's home following complaints that @entity2 was ' forcing ' her child to be a boy since she already had three other girls			1
and having lived as a boy since the age of five , @entity27 , now 12 , is about to begin taking hormone blockers to prevent himself developing as a woman			1
when he is 16 he will begin taking testosterone , and when he is 18 he will have gender reassignment surgery			0
' i 've just always felt like a boy , ' said @entity27			2
it was normal until year six , but then when i got my name changed they would n't call me @entity27 for about three months , and then when they started calling me @entity27 they still would n't call me " she " , they carried on calling me " he "			2
' @entity27 and his mother @entity2 talking about his life with @entity54 and @entity55 on @entity57 's @entity56 speaking about supporting her son , @entity2 said : ' just as it is with all my kids , they are who they are and i do believe in encouraging that			1
there was no big decision to make , it was just the way it flowed , until we actually decided to change his name			0
' the school were n't very happy about it and tried to look for legal reasons why they could n't call him " he "			0
eventually , by law , they had to			0
but that was a very difficult time for us			0
' especially where we come from there was a lot of ignorance surrounding it because no one had heard of it - not the doctor , not the schools , not even social services			1
though they were really , rreally good , and went away and found out what they needed to			0
' @entity27 , who grimaces at the thought of taking hormones but laughs when people tell him it 's ' just a phase ' , confesses he would not be able to live if he were made to do so as a girl , saying : ' i would probably kill myself			2
' a young @entity27 , who decided at the age of five that he was a boy , not the girl he was born @entity27 , who wants to be a gender specialist when he grows up , now feels strongly about sharing his story , saying : ' i think people need to learn to understand it , so they can accept it if it happens again			1
and it is happening more ' happily , in 2001 , he was referred to the @entity137 , and then to @entity138 in @entity139 , the only one of its kind for under - 18s , who referred him to @entity144 to get the hormone blockers			0
for the first time , the family felt as though their story had been heard and understood , and @entity27 says it felt ' amazing ' to finally be able to start living his life			2
for @entity2 , it was relief , and ' confirmation that i was n't doing anything wrong '			2
she said : ' there was always this doubt			0
if all these people were saying " why are you doing this ? " , i 'd question : am i doing something to make him this way ? ' @entity27 , who wants to be a gender specialist when he grows up , now feels strongly about sharing his story , saying : ' i think people need to learn to understand it , so they can accept it if it happens again			2
and it is happening more			0
