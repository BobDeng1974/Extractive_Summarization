@entity0 will make signing a creative midfielder his top priority this summer			1
@entity3 has spent more than £ 150million on seven new players since he took charge of @entity6 just over seven months ago , but he is still not happy with the squad at his disposal			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 accounted for over two thirds of @entity6 's spending spree last year , but @entity3 thinks he still lacks a dynamic midfielder to dictate play			1
@entity0 wants to sign a creative midfielder and has made it his main priority this summer @entity3 signed attacking midfielder @entity9 from @entity19 for £ 60million last august @entity3 also bought @entity20 midfielder @entity10 ( centre ) for £ 14million from @entity22 @entity11 ( left ) was bought for £ 29million from @entity23 but has found first team games limited the lack of such a figure in the current @entity6 squad has led the @entity28 to deploy @entity29 in midfield			1
while @entity29 is happy in midfield , according to @entity3 , there is a feeling that the @entity35 captain is being placed there as a stop - gap until a more suitable candidate becomes available			1
when asked whether he was playing @entity29 there because he felt no - one else was capable of fulfilling that midfield role , @entity3 said : ' of course that 's the case			1
i 'm looking for balance and i need it in midfield			0
' the last games i played with @entity49 and @entity9 in the midfield positions			1
then you need a certain balance for those kind of creative players			0
' so when you have these creative players and you think that ( @entity56 ) @entity56 and @entity57 are also creative , then you have four creative players			0
then you have to look for balance in your team			0
' when it was put to him that signing a creative midfielder should be top of his agenda this summer , @entity3 agreed ' yes , of course , ' the 63 - year - old said			1
@entity67 's @entity66 fits the bill perfectly			0
@entity66 ( right ) of @entity67 is one midfielder who fits @entity3 's specifictation @entity70 ( left ) of @entity71 could also interest @entity3 and he also used to play for @entity6 the midfielder was a regular in @entity3 's @entity20 team until he suffered a knee injury that ruled him out of the @entity75			1
in an uncharacteristic move , @entity3 last year declared his interest in signing the 25 - year - old once his injury problems were over			2
@entity66 recently suffered another setback which will keep him out until the end of the season , but a summer move is not out of the question			0
@entity70 , property of @entity87 rivals @entity71 , keeps being linked with his former club			0
@entity29 looks like he will have to spend some time in midfield from now until the end of the season			0
there has been no hint of objection to that move from the 29 - year - old himself , according to @entity3			2
otherwise he should come to me and say he 's not happy and he never does , ' said @entity3 , who takes his team to @entity97 in the @entity98 on monday			2
' he 's always friendly to me			0
he wants to perform what i want so that 's what i see			0
' @entity3 admits the @entity6 skipper may still be yearning for a move back to his preferred role , though			1
@entity3 said that @entity6 captain @entity29 ( left ) has not been complaining about his midfield role @entity97 's @entity106 will face @entity6 in the @entity98 and says the players look unhappy under @entity3 ' of course when the whole world is writing he has to be in the striker 's position , he will be thinking ' maybe , hey '			1
he 's human , ' the @entity28 added			0
veteran @entity97 striker @entity106 stirred up the tension between the two teams this week by claiming @entity6 's players did not look happy under @entity3			1
' they 're not exciting as they used to be but the club has had big change , ' the former @entity115 forward said			0
@entity106 ' comments were put to @entity3 at a press conference on friday			2
but after spending a big chunk of the press conference talking about @entity127 's ' long - ball @entity6 ' jibe and @entity122 ' criticism of his former club , the @entity28 was in no mood to get involved in a war of words with @entity106			2
' i ca n't react to everybody 's opinion , ' he said			0
@entity134 ( centre ) will miss @entity6 's @entity98 clash with @entity97 on monday due to a calf injury @entity6 striker @entity57 ( right ) could also miss out with an unspecified injury ' there 's such an amount of opinions from fans , and i do n't think he is a fan			2
' @entity6 will be without @entity134 for monday 's tie at @entity144 as he has suffered a setback in his recovery from a calf injury , but @entity10 should return following his head injury			1
@entity3 will make a late call on @entity57 , who is suffering with an unspecified injury .			0
