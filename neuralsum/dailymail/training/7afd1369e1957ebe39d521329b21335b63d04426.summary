failings in the design and planning of centres are deterring older people from venturing in			0
campaigners said they are being made to feel ‘ left behind by society ’			0
researchers asked a group of older people with differing levels of mobility to recount their experiences of a visit to @entity26			1
the participants , who were mainly in their late 60s and 70s , were asked to pinpoint aspects that made their experience in shops , streets and markets and on public transport both easier and more difficult			1
for many , the basic difficulty of getting around the city over-rode any positive aspects they reported			2
several complained that a lack of public lavatories was a major obstacle to their enjoyment of the city			1
others , including some suffering from conditions such as asthma , complained that there had been little consideration of the need for benches and seats to enable them to take short breaks as they walked around			0
they described the seats that were available as ‘ uninviting ’ and were arranged in a way that tended to be isolating			0
the findings were presented in a research paper by a team of design , transport experts and engineers at @entity62			1
the authors highlighted how simple problems such as a shortage of seating in streets or a lack of post boxes are deterring many older people from venturing into city centres			1
they urged councils and retailers to work together to make simple changes to avoid excluding the fastest - growing section of @entity5 ’s population from the heart of major towns and cities			2
dr @entity80 , the lead author of the report , said : ‘ for older people there are simple things like toilets and seating which seem to be completely forgotten			2
study : researchers asked a group of older people with differing levels of mobility to recount their experiences of a visit to @entity26 ‘ the participants noticed that even in new shopping centres with excellent modern disabled access , the lavatories were often situated on the third or fourth floor			1
we seem to get the whole thing wrong			0
it appears that the provision of ramps and lifts is enough and that we have ticked the box			0
‘ subtly what this is saying is “ do n’t use this as a public facility , we will make it difficult for you to use the toilets in the built environment ”			1
’ @entity112 , who carries out similar surveys for @entity114 , said : ‘ this is increasing [ older people ’s ] sense of being left behind by society , which regards them as “ past it ”			0
‘ that sense of being a second - class citizen is something that a lot of older people feel quite bitter about			0
‘ if that impacts on their ability to enjoy life and get out and socialise and get about independently , then we are eroding their quality of life in a serious way			0
