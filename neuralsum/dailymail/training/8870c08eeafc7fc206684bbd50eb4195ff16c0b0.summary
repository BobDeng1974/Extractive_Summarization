' is ' @entity54 ' paid by multi national [ sic ] food corporations to have their tick put onto their products or do they do it for voluntarily ? ' how can this organisation publicly attack a way of life that is helping families reclaim their health in the most natural way possible ? ' @entity0 ( left ) has taken to his @entity40 page in recent weeks to rant about his opinions on a range of topics a storm erupted on social media when mr @entity0 posted this picture of a ham and pineapple pizza with the tick on it the television presenter and author got into disagreement with the @entity76 of @entity43 ( @entity77 ) over the merits of the @entity11 diet last week and now the row has escalated to include the @entity2 tick			1

she explained the @entity6 is ' designed to help guide consumers ' towards making healthier choices while they are shopping			1
' the reality is that millions of @entity43 shop in supermarkets everyday and @entity6 recognises that when it comes to food , many people choose packaged foods , so the @entity6 is designed to help guide consumers towards a healthier product while they ’re standing in the supermarket isle			1

' to be eligible to carry the @entity6 , packaged foods must meet strict nutrition standards , including a combination of lower saturated fat , trans fat , salt and kilojoules , and higher fibre , calcium , wholegrain , fruits and vegetables , than other products of the same type			1
