by @entity1 reporter published : 08:47 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 09:18 est , 2 january 2013 ordeal : @entity3 , 67 , was shot in the wrist by a stray bullet as she celebrated @entity6 a grandmother has been hit by a falling bullet while watching @entity6 fireworks from a balcony of a @entity12 yacht club			1
@entity3 , 67 , was watching the display after an evening of dinner and dancing with her husband and friends at @entity17 when she felt a searing pain in her wrist shortly after midnight			1
a bullet had entered her right wrist and travelled up her arm before exiting halfway up her forearm			1
police believe it came from a rifle that someone fired in the air to celebrate @entity28			2
' she looked down and saw the entry hole and the bleeding and said , " i 've been shot ! " ' her husband @entity31 , 73 , told the @entity33			1
her friends struggled to comprehend exactly what she had said			2
' it 's not something you 're going to hear people say all the time , ' mr @entity31 added			2
' it 's just excruciating , ' his wife told @entity43 of the experience			2
' it 's almost like fire going into my arm and my wrist			1
i 've never felt anything so painful and so scary			0
' one of their friends , a retired physician , helped her get seated and apply pressure to the wound while others called 911			0
she was taken to @entity57 , where doctors removed a large - caliber bullet from her wrist , and she was released three hours later			1
scene : the @entity63 were on a balcony at @entity66 yacht club when she was struck by the bullet yet she said she is still reeling from the terrifying experience			1
' i was extremely lucky that the bullet , which fell from the sky as downtown @entity66 's celebration took place , did not cause a more serious injury or even my death , ' mrs @entity3 said in a statement			1
' this has been one of the most horrifying experiences of my life			0
' an investigation into the shooting is ongoing , police said			0
while police do not know where the bullet came from , they could match it to the gun if evidence leads them to the weapon , police said			1
fears : @entity3 , pictured second right with her husband @entity91 , right , said she was lucky she was n't killed safe : mrs @entity3 , pictured with her grandchildren , called the pain from the wound ' excruciating ' hit : @entity96 , 12 more people are injured or killed each year by falling bullets than many would believe			1
from 1985 to 1992 , 118 victims of gunshot wounds in the @entity103 area alone were thought to have been struck by them			0
these included people hit by bullets while going about their everyday business			0
the chance of being killed by a falling bullet is much higher than a typical shooting - because those unlucky enough to be hit by falling shells are more likely to be struck on the head			1
doctors say a spent bullet falls back to @entity114 with a speed of between 90 and 180 metres per second			1
a bullet travelling at less than 60 metres per second can cause a fatal skull injury			1
last year , @entity96 ( pictured ) was shot in the head while celebrating @entity6 outside his @entity12 home , but survived			1
it came weeks after @entity121 , a teenage @entity122 girl , died in a ' freak accident ' in @entity124 after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile away			0
authorities have noted more injuries caused by gunshots into the air in recent years			0
' people think of it as harmless , because they 're point up in the air , ' @entity66 police spokesman @entity132 said			0
' but it 's been shown time and time again ; this is just one of those things that can have very , very , negative results			0
' it 's obviously in the public mind now about this type of issue			0
but we still run into the situation where , unfortunately , some members of the public are not getting the message			0
' the shooting comes a year after 12 - year - old @entity96 was hit in the head by a bullet while watching @entity28 's fireworks outside his family 's home in @entity157 , @entity12			1
the boy 's mother saw him fall to the ground , bleeding from his eyes and nose			0
he was rushed to hospital and staff found a bullet had entered the top of his head and had become lodged in his cheek			2
@entity96 survived the ordeal and his family has since formed the nonprofit group @entity171 to raise awareness of the dangers of celebratory gunfire			0
it came after a 15 - year - old @entity122 girl , @entity121 , was shot dead while riding her horse and cart back from a @entity179 after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile away			2
at first it was thought she died as a result of falling from her buggy after her brother found her in a pool of blood			0
but when she got to the hospital they found a bullet lodged in her head			2
@entity196 sheriff @entity195 told @entity197 the man said he was preparing to clean his muzzle - loaded rifle after deer hunting and fired it into the air .			0
