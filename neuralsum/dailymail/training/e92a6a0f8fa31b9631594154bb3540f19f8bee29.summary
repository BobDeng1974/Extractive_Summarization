by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 17:28 est , 21 december 2012 one is a byword for luxury , not to mention the favoured hotel of celebrities and royalty , dominating one of the most expensive areas of @entity8			2
the other is a low - budget wedding and conference venue in an unassuming @entity13 market town			1
but now @entity14 in @entity15 has become embroiled in a @entity17 legal battle with its famous @entity19 namesake			1
not so salubrious : @entity14 , in @entity15 , @entity13 , has held its name for over 80 years historic : the @entity8 was opened by @entity22 in 1906			1
the building is neoclassical in the @entity26 manner , built during the @entity27 to resemble a stylish @entity29 block of flats , over arcades that consciously evoked the @entity32 lawyers acting on behalf of the @entity8 hotel have written to @entity35 , owner of the @entity36 , warning him that if he does not change the name of his small business he will be taken to court for trademark infringement			1
yesterday mr @entity35 accused the @entity8 hotel , which had a turnover of £ 32.3million last year , of ‘ using a sledgehammer to crack a nut ’ , and said it would ruin him to fight it in court			1
mr @entity35 said @entity46 , which has stood for more than 80 years , poses little competition to the capital ’s – especially as afternoon tea at the @entity8 venue costs guests more than he charges per person for an entire wedding meal			1
the 43 - year - old said : ‘ when i opened the letter i thought it was a joke			0
i could not believe my eyes			0
‘ what kind of competition do they think we might pose to @entity14 in @entity8 ? tough times : mr @entity35 said his is a small family business , ' trading in difficult times and running a conference centre in a rural community in @entity13 ' inside the @entity68 : mr @entity35 , who even owns the rights to the website www.theritz.co.uk , now fears his wedding and conference venue will suffer as a result and accused the hotel of using ' a sledgehammer to crack a nut ' quite a difference : owner mr @entity35 claims that @entity68 's @entity14 poses little competition to the capital 's - especially as afternoon tea at the @entity8 venue costs more per head than an entire wedding at his five - star fancy : the 106 - year - old @entity8 , on @entity8 's @entity19 , claims @entity15 entrepreneur @entity35 stole its trademark ‘ we operate in completely different markets			1
they serve the rich and famous , we serve a largely local clientele who just want good food and facilities at a good price			0
‘ but even if we took this to court and won , the costs would kill us			0
’ in a letter to the wedding venue , lawyers argued that @entity14 name was synonymous with excellence in hotel and restaurant services , and gave mr @entity35 a deadline of 4pm on december 19 to agree to a name change			1
this has since been extended , although a deadline has yet to be set			0
@entity8 law firm @entity108 , representing @entity14 owners @entity110 , said : ‘ our clients are concerned to discover that you are using the domain name in connection with a business which appears to be trading as “ @entity14 ” and offering banqueting and conference services			1
‘ as you are no doubt aware , @entity118 was opened by @entity22 in 1906 , and since then its owners have built up a very substantial reputation and goodwill throughout the world			2
as with any valuable property , our clients can not allow their trademarks to be used without consent			2
’ fighting talk : lawyers for the @entity8 in @entity8 said its owners ' have built up a very substantial reputation and good will throughout the world in @entity133 and the @entity14 name in connection with hotel ' the letter adds that @entity138 takes any infringement of its valuable intellectual property rights ‘ extremely seriously ’			1
mr @entity35 said his ritz was founded in the @entity142 as a cinema , then became a ballroom before falling into disrepair			0
it was always called @entity14			0
he added : ‘ we are a small family business trading in difficult times and running a conference centre in @entity13			1
we do not even have rooms for guests to stay in and people can not just wander in off the street for a drink or a meal			0
our venue is simply hired out for events			0
’ mr @entity35 bought the building , which had been derelict for five years two years ago and spent £ 800,000 refurbishing it			2
it caters for 250 to 600 guests and costs £ 3,000 to hire for 12 hours			0
he opened it as a wedding and conference venue in november last year			0
that , and his use of the domain name www.theritzuk.co.uk , seems to have triggered @entity138 ’s interest in his business			0
@entity172 , managing director of @entity14 in @entity8 , said it was simply defending ‘ its reputation in order to maintain the quality of the brand ’ .			2

the @entity22 conference centre is in rural @entity15 , @entity13
it has borne the name ' @entity14 ' in the small town for over 80 years
cost per head for entire wedding there is *cheaper* than @entity14 afternoon tea
afternoon tea at @entity8 ' costs more per head than wedding ' in centre
@entity8 : ' **[** we **]** can not allow **[** our **]** trademarks to be used without consent '
owner @entity35 slams @entity8 for using ' sledgehammer to crack a nut '
