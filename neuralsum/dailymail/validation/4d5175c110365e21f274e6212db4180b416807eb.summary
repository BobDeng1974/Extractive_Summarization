a @entity1 backpacker who wrote a romantic note to locate a handsome stranger after spotting him on a @entity5 beach has finally met her @entity6 for the first time			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , left a handmade poster for the man , who she saw in @entity12 on friday and described as ' shirtless , wearing black shorts with stars tattooed on his torso and running with a curly , bouncy and blonde dog '			1
in her note , entitled ' is this you ? ' , she invited the mystery stranger to meet her on the same beach on tuesday			1
but the message soon became a source of huge online interest with the identity of both the author and its intended target generating unexpected publicity			2
then on tuesday at 2pm , in front of a gathering crowd waiting to see the two finally introduce themselves , @entity30 came forward to meet the note 's author , @entity8 , an artist , on the picturesque foreshore			1
@entity8 , who is originally from the west coast of @entity38 , studied at @entity39 before backpacking in @entity5 where she will stay for another two months			1
she said that she had not been expecting the hype surrounding her handwritten note			0
' ' @entity61 somewhere and have a drink away from everyone , ' he told her , as the crowd watching their date clapped and cheered			2
mr @entity30 came forward on sunday morning to reveal himself as the mystery man , and told @entity69 that he planned on heading down to the picturesque spot to ask his brunette admirer on a date for the evening			1
the @entity73 , who works at a local burger joint , said that he first heard of the poster when his housemate came home at 3am on saturday night and woke him up			0
' he was carrying on and telling me about a poster that two @entity82 girls had told him about that described me , ' he said			2
' he knew it was me because i 'm the only guy in @entity12 who has star tattoos , @entity89 - @entity88 hair and a labradoodle			1
' mr @entity30 said he and his housemate drove down to the shore in the dark to try and find the note , and that even when he saw it for himself , he had a hard time believing it was real			1
@entity8 was greeted at the picturesque meeting spot with great fanfare after their story had generated huge publicity the @entity9 artist was greeted as she stepped off her ferry to a sign that said ' here 's to a happy ending '			1
' of course i 'm going down			0
but just going up to her and asking to chat is a bit out of the question with all the attention , so i 'm just going to have to skip a step and ask if she wants to have dinner tonight , ' mr @entity30 told @entity69			1
' i finish work at 2pm and i 'll see if she wants to have dinner or a drink at maybe seven			2
' i 'm not sure if the poor girl knows what she 's gotten herself into			0
it 's just gotten so big , i 've gotten messages from friends overseas saying that they 've read the story			0
' the poster in question was tied to a pole down at the shorefront and was also posted on @entity124 on saturday			0
' i was sitting on the grass on friday watching the sea ... you were playing with your dog			0
you ran past me and smiled , ' it said			0
' would you like to go for a drink / coffee / walk ? ? ? i 'm in @entity132 just now , my ferry arrives back in @entity12 on tuesday 3rd			1
' i 'm in town for 1 night only ... but let 's see how things go ... on the off - chance you are single , remember who i am and would like to meet for a drink / coffee / walk			2
mr @entity30 has revealed himself as the mystery man who captured the heart of the mystery woman he said he was looking forward to tuesday and meeting his mystery girl ' i 'll be sitting on the grass , watching the sea from 1 - 1.30pm onwards on tuesday ... maybe you 'll run past again ? ! ? ' mr @entity30 said his mother had called him because she had been told of the sign and thought it was such a coincidence that the man described in the sign had star tattoos as well			1
' when i told her that it was me , she started freaking out and telling everyone in the office , ' he said			0
' she 's all for me going down			0
she told me that she did n't raise me to not show up , so that 's what i 'm going to do			0
' it 's a bit overwhelming , i 've never had something like this happen before			0
in high school if you passed a note the teacher would just take it off you			0
' mr @entity30 said while he did not know who the woman was , he remembered smiling at a particular woman that day on the beach			2
' it 's all a bit exciting , it 's going to be a big day , ' he said			0
the signs were posted on @entity124 page and has sparked an online debate ' @entity12 is a pretty small town and from the amount of people who have told me they 're going to come down and watch what happens it sounds like everyone i know will be there			1
' @entity8 may have had some inkling of the stir the note has caused , pleading with the public to not have the sign removed from the premises			2
' in the spirit of happy endings , give this sign a chance to be seen by the right eyes , ' she penned			0
' it may even bring a dozen or so people back on tuesday , intrigued ... who is this girl with the long brown hair and the boy with the star tattoos and the dog and will they meet for a drink ? ' i will , on my return to @entity12 on tuesday , remove it myself ... whatever the ending may be			1
thank you ! ' mr @entity30 promised he would keep the fascinated followers of the real - life fairytale up to date with the outcome of their evening .			2
