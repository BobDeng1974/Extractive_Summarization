it was previously rumored that founding member @entity8 was being interviewed for a possible board position on another company but they initially said that such a position ' would not impact ' his work with @entity2 's company , called @entity15			1
now it has been reported that @entity8 is leaving the day - to - day operations of the company , just as a handful of staffers and the teenage son of @entity23 head @entity22 all departed before him			0
moving on : @entity8 ( left ) is now leaving the company he founded with @entity2 ( right ) @entity25 reported that @entity8 , who was founded @entity15 along with @entity2 and @entity27 consultant @entity26 , is leaving and though his new job has not been confirmed , initial speculation connects him to @entity30			1
the video aggregation company is said to be losing cash quickly and it is supposedly being kept alive through early november so that it 's closure does n't hurt @entity2 's chances at winning the @entity36 race			1
the latest news about the floundering company comes weeks after it was revealed that the 15 - year - old son of @entity23 president @entity22 had a position on the company 's advisory board and had stock options in the company			0
the teenager resigned just hours later , and it now is clear that he is not the first person to leave the company			0
running for office : after a slew of highly - publicized departures , there is speculation that the company is only staying afloat to keep it open while @entity2 runs for @entity36 it was known that the small company had a round of layoffs in the spring , but now the @entity60 reported that eight people left in april			1
' when the company moved its focus from original production to curation , the production team was impacted			0
several were given the option of changed , curation - focused roles with the company ; they declined , ' a spokeswoman told @entity72			0
@entity2 did his best on last week to calm the fires without actually revealing any more details after a debate last week			1
her idea : @entity26 is said to be the one who approached @entity22 's son @entity79 ( seen with his father at left in 2009 ) to be a member of the advisory board of @entity2 's start - up @entity15			1
he has since resigned connected : @entity26 , seen here talking with @entity2 and trailed by @entity86 , is well known in @entity27 ' this company is in its infancy			2
of course it has changed its business model			0
it ’s going through changes , ' he said of the internal overhaul at @entity15			2
' i ’m a part of an ownership group and we ’ve concluded not to discuss that			0
' the other parts of the ownership group are mr @entity8 and @entity26 , who admitted to being the one to suggest @entity22 join the board because the teenager is apparently known for his insight into popular trends among teens			0
ms @entity26 then had a conversation with both @entity22 and @entity108 and they agreed to have the now - 15 - year - old sign on to @entity15 's advisory board and receive a ' de minimus ' amount of stock options in return			2
an unidentified source told @entity116 that @entity2 himself was ' not involved at all ' with the decision , and ms @entity26 herself admitted at an early stage that the politician would not be a part of the day - to - day operations of the start up			1
promoting the brand : if @entity2 wins , he will have to resign from the board of @entity15 and stop promoting it from his well - followed @entity129 feed the @entity130 reported that even in the nascent phase , it was clear among the founders that @entity2 would be a more public role			1
when the launched the company , ms @entity26 reportedly said to @entity2 : ' you know what ? you should do it , found the company			1
obviously you do n’t have to be involved — you ’ve got a full - time job			0
’ unlike many of the other boldface names connected to @entity15 , like @entity148 and @entity150 's @entity149 , it does not seem as if the elder @entity22 actually has any financial stake in the company			2
very little has previously been revealed about the start - up , which was officially created in may 2012			0
@entity2 reportedly came up with the idea for the company , whose mission is to effectively become a different iteration of @entity158 where the work of up - and - coming students is highlighted , while meeting with ms @entity26 and mr @entity8			2
he said it was easy to raise the $ 1.75million worth of seed money for the venture ' because of the power of the idea '			0
he said nothing of his rising power on the national political stage			0
for @entity2 's part , he may not be able to be involved in the company much longer			2
if he wins the @entity36 race in november , he will be forced to withdraw from @entity15 's board .			1

@entity2 helped found a video aggregation start up site called @entity15
@entity2 is now running for the empty @entity36 spot and *insiders* say it is staying open so that it does n't hurt his *election* chances
