@entity0 apologised to his fans after blowing his chance of securing pole position for the @entity5 @entity4 after inexplicably aborting his final run in saturday 's dramatic qualifying session			1
@entity0 appeared set to secure his second pole in as many years in front of his home crowd with track conditions seemingly worsening in the rain - hit session			1
but as his title rival @entity13 snatched pole in the final moments , @entity0 chose to bail out of his last lap , confident he had done enough to start sunday 's race from the front of the pack			1
he later admitted : ' i made a mistake today , a bad call that decided my qualifying			2
i 'm so sorry to all the amazing fans			0
i 'll push all the way for them tomorrow			0
' @entity13 will be joined on the front row by reigning world champion @entity43 with @entity44 , yet to secure a podium in 14 previous attempts at @entity34 , third on the grid			1
the @entity48 of @entity49 was fourth fastest with @entity51 's @entity50 next up and ahead of @entity0			1
it is the third qualifying blunder from @entity53 in as many races			2
he started behind @entity13 in @entity55 after making an error on his final lap in @entity58			1
he then spun during the dying moments of qualifying last time out in @entity60			2
top three ( from left ) : @entity44 , @entity13 and @entity43 will head the field for sunday 's race fitting : @entity44 celebrates claiming a place in the top three as he wore a helmet in tribute to his late father after starting ninth at the @entity69 he fought back through the field to finish second , and he will need a similar virtuoso drive to restrict the damage caused by his qualifying howler here			1
' i do n't have anything to say at the moment , ' a dumbfounded @entity0 said afterwards			1
his boss @entity78 added : ' he felt the lap was worse and bailed out which is unfortunate			0
there was lot of time to be found in sector three			0
' even if @entity0 recovers to finish second on sunday - in what is expected to be a dry race - and @entity13 wins , it will see the @entity87 extend his lead in the championship to 36 points at the midway stage of the season			1
there was also big shock in the first phase of this most surprising of qualifying sessions with the @entity98 pair of @entity99 and @entity100 , and the @entity102 duo of @entity103 and @entity104 , eliminated from qualifying in @entity105			2
plenty to ponder : @entity99 was left to think after he was eliminated in the first session final standings : @entity13 topped the charts after @entity110 on saturday @entity99 took to the circuit on slick tyres , but as more rain fell in the final minutes of the 18 - minute opening session , it appeared to catch the @entity116 out as he was sent sideways in his @entity98			1
it means he will start only 19th for tomorrow 's race with team - mate @entity100 one place worse off			1
' i think it happens sometimes in this weather , ' @entity99 said afterwards			0
' thirty seconds later you put on the right tyre and you are a hero			0
we are here with two ferraris and two @entity102 ' so we did something wrong compared to other teams but we would n't do anything differently			0
' at the moment it is unpredictable			0
we will start at the back with some overtakes to do , so we have nothing to lose			2
' @entity102 ' failure to progress through to the second stage of qualifying caps a miserable weekend for the @entity5 outfit			2
all over : @entity138 was forced to retire from the first practice session after an engine failure in her @entity102 dramatic : @entity102 teammate @entity104 crashed out in a rather more spectacular way during practice getting carried away : @entity104 's car is removed from the track but @entity102 managed to repair it quickly @entity138 , the first female racer at a grand prix weekend in 22 years , lasted just four laps in practice on friday while @entity104 then suffered a huge shunt during the same session			0
it is in stark contrast to their performance last time out in @entity60 where they secured a front - row lockout with @entity104 having claimed his first pole in six years			1
@entity160 ultimately finished third ; the team 's only podium finish of the season to date			2
the @entity165 pair of @entity166 and @entity167 both shined in the inclement conditions			0
indeed the impressive young @entity169 topped the timesheets temporarily in @entity171			0
as for @entity167 , it was a personal best for him in qualifying , finishing behind team - mate @entity166 in 13th			1
he will however , start five places back down the grid after serving a grid penalty for a gearbox change			0
@entity178 saw both their drivers @entity179 , in @entity105 , and @entity181 in the ensuing session end up in the barriers following spins			0
the team are so far pointless this season in what has been a torrid campaign for the @entity190 outfit .			0

@entity192 aborts final qualifying run believing he had done enough to secure pole
@entity0 's @entity196 team - mate @entity13 snatches lead in final minutes
@entity44 to start sunday 's race from third
reigning world champion @entity43 will start second
