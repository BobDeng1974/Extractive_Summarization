the world ’s biggest cave chamber has been founded in @entity2 , reports @entity3			2
the huge @entity5 cavern , which measures 380.7 million cubic feet ( 10.78 million cubic metres ) in volume , was recently declared the world 's largest			1
laser - mapping was used by an expedition to work out it ’s size , exceeding the previous record holder of @entity12 in @entity13 by 10 per cent			1

some of the largest caves in the world are found here in the @entity39 and @entity40			0
it was first documented by a @entity2 - @entity43 geology team in 1989			2
but it was not until last year that a @entity18 team working with the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity2 revealed its true size			1
‘ to me , this is like discovering that @entity52 [ the @entity54 peak ] is larger than @entity55 , ’ @entity49 , an expedition co-leader who studied the @entity2 cave , told @entity3			2
the cave would comfortably fit a @entity60 747 - if you could get one in there - and is located about 325ft ( 100 metres ) underground			1
and it also contains stalagmites as tall as 148ft ( 45 metres ) , which are among the world ’s biggest			0
the ‘ supercave ’ is located in the @entity33 near @entity34 , @entity2 although it was found in 1989 its size was n't determined until a @entity18 team working with the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity2 measured it last year the cave two massive domed chambers connected by a 2,795 - foot ( 852 metres ) passage - with some suggesting it might actually classify as two chambers			1
these formed thanks to the cave being located under a sea for 600 million years , accumulating miles - thick layers of sediments such as limestone in the process			0
when it rains a stream runs through the chamber , which deepens it			0
it has two massive domed chambers connected by a 2,795 - foot ( 852 metres ) passage - with some suggesting it might actually classify as two chambers			0
the caves have not been fully explored , however , with the @entity87 laser - mapping technique being used to work out what most of it looks like			2
some portions of the cave are still unknown , however - marked by the black regions in the map of the cavern			0
the cave would comfortably fit a @entity60 747 - if you could get one in there - and is located about 325 feet ( 100 metres ) underground the photographer ’s lights illuminate the green - hued @entity102 river in the @entity103			1
the @entity5 volume measurement exceeds @entity12 in @entity13 , the past title - holder , by about 10 percent			0
but the @entity13 cavern is still the world ’s largest by surface area , with some 1.66 million square feet			0

laser - mapping has revealed a cave in @entity2 is the world 's biggest
according to @entity3 it is 380.7 million cubic feet big
that *dwarfs* the previous record holder in @entity13 by 10 per cent
the ‘ supercave ’ is located in the @entity33 near @entity34 , @entity2
although it was found in 1989 its size was n't determined until a @entity18 team working with the @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity2 measured it
the cave would comfortably fit a @entity60 747 - if you could get one in there - and is located about 325 feet underground
