by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 18:12 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 03:24 est , 31 august 2012 @entity2 's former ambassador to @entity3 yesterday spoke of his ‘ heartbreak ’ at the sight of wounded soldiers taking part in the @entity9 ’ opening ceremony			1
sir @entity10 accused the government of ‘ betraying ’ those who served in @entity3 , because its plan to pull out troops in 2014 would hand large parts of the country to the @entity17			1
he said it was painful to watch the soldiers bear their horrific injuries so bravely			1
hero : @entity23 @entity22 , who lost both legs in @entity3 , carries the torch into the @entity26 eight wounded servicemen and women are in @entity2 ’s @entity9 team , and several others were involved in the torch relay			2
sir @entity10 , who was @entity2 ’s ambassador in @entity33 until june 2010 , said that he had been particularly moved by the high - profile involvement of captain @entity35 and @entity23 @entity22 , who both lost both legs in separate bomb blasts in @entity3			1
he said on @entity40 ’s today programme : ‘ what breaks my heart is when i saw captain @entity35 running down @entity43 carrying the @entity45 flame last night and @entity23 @entity22 going into the @entity26 also carrying the torch			0
‘ we are betraying them because we – the diplomats , the politicians , the civil servants – have failed to accompany a perfectly sensible military tactical campaign with a serious political strategy			0
’ sir @entity10 said politicians on both sides of the @entity53 had failed to use the results of the military effort to develop a lasting peace process in @entity3			1
heartbreaking : sir @entity10 said it was painful to watch wounded soldiers taking part in the spectacular show he said there was a real danger that the fragile gains made in the country would quickly evaporate when @entity2 and @entity66 troops leave in 2014			1
he added : ‘ what we are doing , essentially , is cultivating an allotment in a jungle , and the question is what happens when the gardeners leave ? ’ sir @entity10 said that @entity74 had been ‘ virtually eliminated ’ in @entity3 but that politicians had failed to invest the will and resources needed to ‘ finish the job ’			1
he said @entity2 troops had done a superb job , but added : ‘ we ’re in danger of betraying their legacy , betraying their courage , unless the politicians , the diplomats , do their job , which is to broker a serious solution inside @entity3 and involving all the countries of the region			2
’ @entity92 and @entity93 have both committed to withdrawing all combat troops from @entity3 by 2014			0
critics , including some in the military , accuse the two leaders of acting for domestic political purposes and warn that premature withdrawal from @entity3 will hand control over large parts of the country to the @entity17			0
' betrayed ' : discus thrower @entity103 lost both legs when his armoured vehicle hit an improvised device while on patrol in @entity3 in 2007 athlete : volleyball player @entity110 sustained serious back and leg injuries in a blast in @entity3 in 2008 sir @entity10 called on the @entity66 to broker talks with all the main parties in @entity3 , including the @entity17 , along with talks involving the country ’s neighbours , particularly @entity119			1
but he conceded this was unlikely ahead of november ’s @entity66 elections as there were ‘ no votes in being portrayed talking to the @entity17 ’			0
ministers insist that by 2014 the @entity3 security forces will be fully trained and capable of dealing with the @entity17 by themselves			0
but colonel @entity126 , a former commander of @entity2 forces in @entity3 , also yesterday accused politicians of failing to match the commitment of the troops			2
he said that soldiers did not talk of ‘ betrayal ’ , but added : ‘ i think there have been some very serious shortcomings politically			0
’ colonel @entity126 said the @entity136 had failed to prevent the @entity3 government sliding into the ‘ depths of corruption ’			2
and he said it was extraordinary that @entity119 had been allowed to supply ‘ such strong levels of support to the @entity17 ’			0
pledge : @entity93 ( left ) and @entity92 ( right ) have committed to withdrawing all combat troops from @entity3 by 2014			0
