a teenage girl was beheaded by a relative in northern @entity2 after she turned down his marriage proposals , according to reports			1
the victim , named as @entity7 , was decapitated with a knife in the @entity10 district of @entity11 on tuesday , local police said			1
she is believed to be around 15 - years - old			0
a police spokesman said two men , named as @entity14 and @entity15 , had been arrested following the teenage girl 's murder			1
the two men are understood to be close relatives of the victim that live in the same village			1
local police sources have said the men behind the attack wanted to marry the girl , but their advances had been turned down by victim 's father			1
violence : the teenage girl is understood to have been beheaded after she refused a relative 's repeated marriage proposals ( file photo ) @entity7 is understood to have been attacked as she returned to her home in @entity36 village after going out to collect water from a nearby well			1
her father told a local news agency he had not wanted his daughter to get married because she was too young			0
@entity2 's @entity42 regime - notorious for its oppression of women in the country - was ousted in 2001 , but extreme violence against women is still rife			1
in 2009 the elimination of @entity51 law was introduced in @entity2 , criminalising child marriage , forced marriage , ' giving away ' a girl or woman to settle a dispute , among other acts of violence against the female population of the ultra-conservative @entity60 nation			1
but the @entity61 has said there is a ' long way to go ' before the rights of @entity2 women are fully protected			1
comprehensive official statistics on the number of incidents of violence against women in the country are difficult to establish , with the majority of cases going unreported			0
however in the year to march 2011 , @entity2 's @entity73 registered over 2,000 acts of violence against women			1
the @entity77 - led @entity76 and @entity78 has given high priority to re-establishing women 's rights that were eradicated under the @entity42 as part of its efforts to create a security strategy for @entity2			1
but with the deadline for international troops to pull out of the country - scheduled for the end of 2014 - looming , activists have warned that the outlook for the female population remains bleak			0
@entity92 has said women 's rights are increasingly at risk in the run up to the scheduled draw - down of @entity77 forces , with early and forced marriage , impunity for violence against women and lack of access of justice among the long list of challenges they still face			2
' beheaded ' : the teenage girl is understood to have been attacked as she returned to her home in the @entity107 after fetching water from a nearby well while @entity2 women have won back some basic rights since the @entity42 was toppled 11 years ago , so - called honour killings remain relatively commonplace in the war - torn @entity60 nation			1
the summer of 2012 saw a spate of so - called honour killings in @entity2			2
in july a father shot his two teenage daughters dead in the @entity117 of @entity118 when they returned home four days after running away with a man			0
earlier that same month shocking video footage emerged of a 22 - year - old @entity2 woman being gunned down with an @entity122 in front of a crowd of baying villagers in @entity126			2
thought to have been married to a member of a hardline @entity42 militant group , the woman , known only as @entity129 , was executed after being accused of having an affair with a @entity42 commander			0
her murder followed a horrific case in @entity135 in which a man beheaded his ex-wife and two of their children			0
@entity142 's former spouse barged into her home and decapitated her in front of their eight - year - old son and nine - year - old daughter			0
he then killed the children because they had seen , police said			0
this year the country 's @entity73 recorded 16 incidents of honour killings in march and april alone , the first two months of the @entity2 new year			2
during the month of july a spate of brutal killings in the country - which left four women and two children dead - attracted international attention			0
the @entity73 warned last month that @entity2 has seen a sharp rise in cases of both honour killings and rape , adding that many incidents of murder and sexual assault go unreported to authorities			2
the ever - present threat of violence at the hands of men in a patriarchal society has also led to an increase in cases of @entity2 women taking their own lives			1
dozens of women commit suicide in the country each year , often to escape failed or abusive marriages			0
divorce is still taboo in @entity2 , and women who flee their marriages , if caught , face stringent prison sentences			2
a family court established in @entity2 's capital , @entity188 , in 2003 offered a semblance of hope for women in the country that are trapped in forced marriages or subject to domestic violence - but it still adheres to @entity2 's version of @entity60 sharia law			1
traditional @entity2 culture places no onus on a man who wants to leave his spouse to go through legal proceedings - he can divorce his wife without any approval of the justice system			2
in the court in @entity188 , a woman must plead her case before judges and lawyers , and she must have five male witnesses willing to attend in support			0
a recent case saw a 17 - year - old girl forced to accept a marriage proposal from a man she despised successfully argued for her engagement to be scrapped by the court , according to the @entity217			1
tragically for @entity219 , who dreamed of becoming a doctor , the decision did not mark a return to the life of relative freedom she enjoyed before her engagement			0
before taking her battle to the court , the desperate teenager had thrown herself from the roof of her @entity188 home			0
@entity219 broke her back in the fall , but survived			0
her fiance insisted that their planned marriage must still go ahead , leading the now disabled teenager to take her battle to the family court			2
following the case , the 17 - year - old is back in her childhood home			0
her family did not allow her to return to school , and the injuries she sustained in her failed suicide bid mean relatives fear she will be unlikely to marry in the future			0
while she managed , against the odds , to free herself from a fate she dreaded , the future for this defiant @entity2 girl still looks bleak			1
challenges : @entity2 women have won back some basic human rights since the fall of the @entity42 , but there is still a ' long way to go ' , activists say ( file photo )			2

two men have been arrested following the death of the teenage girl in @entity11 *province* , northern @entity2
victim , named as ' @entity7 ' , was beheaded by her cousin after she and her family turned down his marriage proposal , a police spokesman said
