for more than 400 years , the bodies of sailors who perished on the @entity2 were preserved in silt in the @entity4			1
experts are using a combination of dna analysis and pioneering laser technology to learn more about what life would have been like on @entity12 ’s flagship			1
and now bones taken from the sea bed have revealed that rickets may have been prevalent throughout the crew			1
the tibia bones of sailors ( pictured ) who sailed on @entity12 ’s @entity2 ship were analysed at the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
the deformations in the abnormal bones were suspected to be due to a metabolic bone disease such as rickets , caused by poor diets of the time the @entity2 was @entity12 ’s flagship before it sank in battle on the 19th july 1545 , resulting in the death of more than 400 men			1
the bones of sailors , as well as a dog called @entity34 , and artefacts from the wreckage , were raised from the @entity4 in october 1982			1
in particular , two sets of tibia bones were found that appeared anatomically healthy , but were abnormal in shape			1
the deformations in these bones , obtained from the @entity43 , were suspected to be due to a metabolic bone disease			1
experts from the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) used a process called @entity48 spectroscopy to analyse the chemical composition of the bones ( pictured )			1
@entity48 is a non-destructive laser technology that uses the beams of laser light to see changes in chemical composition across the bones the @entity2 ( illustrated ) was @entity12 ’s flagship before it sank in battle on the 19th july 1545 , resulting in the death of more than 400 men			1
it is the first time @entity48 spectroscopy has been used to study bone diseases in historical populations experts from the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) used a process called @entity48 spectroscopy to analyse the chemical composition of these bones			1
@entity48 is a non-destructive laser technology that uses the beams of light to see changes in chemical composition across samples			1
the team then compared these historical bones to ‘ normal ’ bones donated by the @entity75 at the @entity76			2
it is the first time @entity48 spectroscopy has been used to study bone diseases in historical populations , and the work has been published in the @entity81			2
the results of the @entity48 study confirmed that the abnormally shaped bones did have chemical abnormalities			1
the bones of sailors , as well as a dog called @entity34 , and artefacts from the wreckage , were raised from the @entity4 ( marked ) in october 1982 the 16th - century warship @entity2 ( illustrated sinking in 1545 ) underwent a meticulous programme of conservation after being lifted from the seabed in october 1982			1
for decades after the hull of @entity12 's flagship was raised , it was sprayed with millions of litres of water and wax chemicals to preserve it the 16th - century warship @entity2 underwent a meticulous programme of conservation after being lifted from the seabed more than 30 years ago			1
for decades after the hull of @entity12 's flagship was raised in october 1982 , it was constantly sprayed with millions of litres of water and wax chemicals to preserve it			0
at first , the hull was sprayed with recycled , fresh water at a temperature of less than 5 ° @entity109 ) to stop the wood drying out and to inhibit bacterial activity			0
the hull had been preserved under the sea as it had been embedded in mud preventing bacteria and tides from eroding it			0
in 1985 , the ship was turned upright and titanium props were installed to support the internal structure and work was undertaken to remove as much sediment as possible			0
in 1985 , the ship ( pictured ) was turned upright and titanium props were installed to support the internal structure and work was undertaken to remove as much sediment as possible			0
once drying is complete in 2017 , the internal walls surrounding the hull will be removed and visitors will see an unobstructed view the @entity130 ( pictured ) has worked closely with the team behind the @entity134 warship @entity132 which has used a similar highly - sophisticated drying process from 1994 , active conservation commenced with the spraying of @entity138 ( @entity138 ) , a water - soluble polymer which can penetrate deep into the wood and support the cell walls			0
and last year , on april 29 , the @entity142 were turned off and the hull began its final air - drying phase to remove 100 tonnes of water during the next four to five years			0
visitors to the @entity130 in @entity148 's @entity147 will be able to view the hull through windows into the airtight chamber as it undergoes this final stage of conservation			0

once drying is complete in 2017 , the internal walls surrounding the hull will be removed and visitors will be able to see a completely unobstructed view of the hull			0
@entity158 , head of conservation at the @entity43 , said : ' the conservation of @entity12 's warship @entity2 has been one of the largest and most complex programmes of this type ever undertaken			1
' it really will be a unique chance for visitors to see our dedicated team preserve such a treasured artefact as they can see through windows into the ' hotbox ' containing the @entity2 when the new museum opens			1
' rickets in adults is known as osteomalacia or soft bones , and the most common cause is a lack of vitamin d and calcium			2
this causes bones to deform , and legs to bow ( pictured )			2
in rare cases , children can be born with a genetic form of rickets last year , a team of experts used the skull of one of the sailors ( left ) to reconstruct the face of one of @entity12 ’s archers ( right ) who died on the ship			1
they believe he was an archer because his skeleton shows evidence of repetitive stress injuries from pulling a longbow			2
they also believe that he was of high rank and it is believed these abnormalities were caused by rickets , brought on by the poor diet of the average person during the 1500s			2

it can also develop if another condition affects how vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body			0
@entity48 is a non-destructive laser technology that uses beams of laser light to see changes in chemical composition across the bones			1
it scatters light over a sample to track changes in colour			2
as the light hits the sample during the scattering process , it loses part of its energy to the material , which causes some of the atoms to vibrate			0
by studying the vibration of the atoms , experts can discover the chemical composition and other useful information about the material			2
the raman effect is weak , and only one part in 10 million of the scattered light has a shifted colour			0
this is too weak to see with the naked eye , so it is analysed using a spectrometer			2
the process is named after @entity263 physicist @entity48			0
he was awarded the 1930 physics @entity264 for the discovery			0
dr. @entity267 , @entity268 at @entity269 and @entity21 said : ‘ this is the first time that this laser technology has been used to study bone disease in archaeological human bone			1
‘ we have identified chemical changes in the bones , without damaging them			0
‘ there is strong evidence to suggest that many of the sailors had suffered from childhood rickets and we hope to apply the @entity48 technique to the study of modern day rickets			1
’ @entity287 , curator of human remains at the @entity43 added : ‘ the @entity43 has the responsibility for the remains of over 179 individuals who perished with the ship			0
‘ the human remains have potential to make a contribution to the public through research , education , display and interpretation			0
‘ their use to confirm the presence and prevalence of metabolic bone disease in the 16th century is one of these contributions			1
’ the @entity48 study , led by professor @entity308 , was funded as part of a £ 1.7 million grant from the @entity311			0
earlier this year , analysis of dog bones found on the ship revealed that the animal - dubbed @entity34 - was a male , possibly a @entity34 and had a dark brown coat			0
last year , a team of experts from @entity318 used the skull of one of the sailors to reconstruct the face of one of @entity12 ’s archers who died on the ship			1
they believe he was an archer because his skeleton shows evidence of repetitive stress injuries from pulling a longbow			0
they also claim that he was of high rank because he was found with an ivory armguard , a silver ring and a bag containing a pewter plate			0
he was more than six feet tall and was in his 20s or 30s .			0

the tibia bones belonged to sailors who died on the @entity2 in 1545
experts analysed the bones using @entity345 laser technology
lasers are used to track abnormalities and find evidence of bone disease
they were analysed at the @entity21 ( @entity353 )
the @entity2 sank in battle on the 19th july 1545 , resulting in 400 deaths
