by @entity0 published : 23:20 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 02:03 est , 13 november 2013 under fire : columnist @entity2 faces calls that he should be fired over a recent column , but he has stood by his point saying it is being taken out of context a conservative @entity9 columnist is under fire and has been branded ' a racist ' after saying that the sight of @entity15 's newly - elected @entity14 mayor and his @entity17 wife would not sit well with much of the populace			1
writer @entity2 has since argued that he was in fact trying to accuse certain members of the @entity21 of holding out - of - date views			1
' people with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor - elect of @entity15 — a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children			1
( should i mention that @entity31 ’s wife , @entity30 , used to be a lesbian ? ) , ' he wrote in the column			1
' this family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts — but not all — of @entity37			0
to cultural conservatives , this does n’t look like their country at all			0
' many media outlets reacted with outrage , with some like @entity43 , the @entity44 and @entity45 calling for the 72 - year - old to be fired			0
@entity48 's political writer @entity47 wrote a piece titled ' stop this man before he writes something again , ' while @entity52 titled her @entity54 post ' so this is the one that is finally going to get @entity2 fired from @entity9 , right ? right ? ' the @entity58 's @entity57 went further : ' it ’s @entity2 who feels disgusted when he sees interracial couples , and he ’s hoisting that view on social conservatives as if they ’re not his own			1
' @entity45 reporter @entity63 wrote that @entity64 , the billionaire owner of @entity65 who recently purchased the @entity9 , should consider whether or not it makes business sense for ' the daily paper in a majority - black city ' to be ' regularly publishing racist op - ed columns '			2
a look at the data proves that there is little support for @entity2 's theory , as a recent @entity77 poll reported that 87 per cent of @entity37 approve of interracial marriages			0
unnerving ? @entity2 argues that a portion of the @entity21 will have to fight off a physical reaction from the sight of the @entity31 family , seen here hugging after @entity31 was elected as the next mayor of @entity15 even fellow columnists at his own paper , like @entity86 , took to their blogs to contextualize - and criticize - the points made by their colleague			1
' given the context of the column , i think that @entity2 is using " conventional views " to mean " culturally conservative views			2
" but insofar as " conventional " means " based on or in accordance with what is generally done or believed , " acceptance of interracial marriage is overwhelmingly conventional , ' @entity86 wrote			0
' and note that the current president of the @entity37 is the biracial child of a white woman married to a black man			0
@entity37 has come a long way			0
' @entity2 spoke out repeatedly on tuesday in an effort to explain his opinion - but not to retract his original statement			2
' the column is about @entity21 extremism and i was not expressing my views , i was expressing the views of what i think some people in the @entity21 held , ' @entity2 later told @entity43			1
' i do n't think everybody in the @entity21 is like that , because i know there are blacks in the @entity21			0
so they 're not all racist , unless i 'm going to start doing mind reading about why those black people are there			0
' he went on to say that ' not a single one of my editors -- and believe me , they 're super sensitive to this sort of stuff ' had a problem with the column			0
full court press : all of the members of the @entity31 family were heavily featured in campaign ads ( seen together on election day after @entity132 flew in as a surprise from college in @entity135 ) modern family : seen here in an undated family photo , the @entity137 have been the subject of racial criticism before but the voters of @entity15 support @entity145 's progressive platform and voted for him en masse this was not even @entity2 's first brush with controversial racial issues this month , as he wrote a hot - button piece about the movie @entity151			1
he also wrote a column this summer from the point of view of @entity155 , defending the neighborhood watchman 's initial suspicion of a young black teenager			0
while @entity2 may be arguing that a portion of the right - wing @entity21 has a problem with the look of the @entity31 family , the same can certainly not be said about @entity15 like himself ( as @entity2 writes for @entity162 but lives in @entity15 )			1
@entity31 , the city 's former public advocate , was elected to take over after mayor @entity164 leaves office			2
@entity166 beat his @entity168 competitor in a landslide , winning 73 per cent of the vote compared to @entity171 's 24 per cent			2
first couple : @entity31 and his wife @entity173 are liberal democrats , and he will be the first @entity175 to lead the country 's biggest city in over two decades his family played a major part in his campaign , with both of his children - daughter @entity132 with her trademark rosebud headband and son @entity185 with his distinctive afro - starring in their own commercials			1
his poet wife @entity173 , who has previously written an article about her time as a lesbian before meeting @entity31 , is politically active and expected to play a major role in the administration			1
this is not the first time that racism has come up in relation to the @entity31 campaign , as mayor @entity164 made a disputed claim in an interview during the months leading up to the election , saying that the candidate was effectively using his family to earn votes in minority communities			2
@entity166 denied the claim , saying that he is simply proud of their close family and they were helping in the campaign because they are all actively involved in one another 's lives .			0

columnist @entity2 wrote that many would have to fight a physical reaction when seeing the mixed - race political family
@entity31 is married to @entity173 , who is @entity17 and was previously a lesbian
@entity166 was elected to be the next mayor of @entity15 in a landslide
@entity2 has defended his column , saying that he is not racist but he was expressing the opinions of some members of the @entity21
