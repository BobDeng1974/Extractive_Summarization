attorney general @entity0 has called for a full investigation into the @entity3 's heavy scrutiny on @entity5 groups			1
the probe , he said , will focus on whether the @entity3 conducted any illegal activity throughout the course of the targeting scandal			1
he called the @entity3 ' actions ' outrageous and unacceptable			1
' speaking to the press for the first time since the scandal broke , @entity0 said : ' the @entity14 is coordinating with the @entity15 to see if any laws were broken in connection with those matters			0
probe : attorney general @entity0 has demanded a full investigation into the @entity3 's scrutiny of conservative groups applying for tax exempt status ' we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations			1
' @entity0 's remarks came a day after it was revealed that acting irs commissioner @entity29 repeatedly failed to tell @entity30 that @entity5 groups were being inappropriately targeted , even after he had been briefed on the matter			1
the @entity3 said on monday that @entity29 was first informed on may , 3 , 2012 , that applications for tax - exempt status by @entity5 groups were inappropriately singled out for extra , sometimes burdensome scrutiny			1
at least twice after the briefing , @entity29 wrote letters to members of @entity30 to explain the process of reviewing applications for tax - exempt status without revealing that the @entity5 had been targeted			2
on july 25 , 2012 , @entity29 testified before the @entity42 oversight subcommittee but again was not forthcoming on the issue - despite being asked about it			0
at the hearing , rep @entity45 , a @entity47 from @entity48 , told @entity29 that some politically active tax - exempt groups in his district had complained about being harassed			2
@entity45 did not explicitly ask if @entity5 groups were being targeted			1
but he did ask how applications were handled			0
@entity29 responded , ' we did group those organizations together to ensure consistency , to ensure quality			0
we continue to work those cases , ' according to a transcript on the committee 's website			0
tea party protesters : dozens of individual organizations have complained that the @entity3 treated them differently from liberal or politically neutral groups he added , ' it is my hope that some of the noise that we heard earlier this year has abated as we continue to work through these cases			1
' earlier , @entity47 rep @entity74 of @entity75 had raised concerns with the @entity3 about complaints that @entity5 groups were being harassed			1
@entity74 specifically mentioned @entity5 groups in his inquiry			2
but in a june 15 , 2012 , letter to @entity74 , @entity29 gave a generic response			0
he said that when the @entity3 saw an increase in applications from groups that were involved in political activity , the agency ' took steps to coordinate the handling of the case to ensure consistency			1
' informed : acting irs commissioner @entity29 was told by staff in may 2012 , that some groups ' applications for tax - exempt status were improperly selected for extra scrutiny he added that agents worked with tax law experts " to develop approaches and materials that could be helpful to the agents working the cases			1
' @entity29 did not mention that in 2011 , those materials included a list of words to watch for , such as ' @entity5 ' and ' patriot			0
' he also did n't disclose that in january 2012 , the criteria for additional screening was updated to include references to the @entity108 or the @entity109			0
' they repeatedly failed to disclose and be truthful about what they were doing , ' said rep. @entity113 , @entity114 , chairman of the @entity42			0
@entity116 's committee is holding a hearing on the issue friday and @entity29 is scheduled to testify			0
' we are going to need to find out how much he knew , ' @entity113 said of @entity29			0
the @entity120 announced monday that it will join a growing list of congressional committees investigating the matter			0
the @entity3 apologized friday for what it acknowledged was ' inappropriate ' targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election to see whether they were violating their tax - exempt status			1
in some cases , the @entity3 acknowledged , agents inappropriately asked for lists of donors			1
the agency blamed low - level employees in a @entity136 office , saying no high - level officials were aware			2
when members of @entity30 repeatedly raised concerns with the @entity3 about complaints that @entity5 groups were being harassed last year , a deputy @entity3 commissioner took the lead in assuring lawmakers that the additional scrutiny was a legitimate part of the screening process			1
that deputy commissioner was @entity29 , who is now the acting head of the agency			0
clampdown : @entity151 was faced with questions about the performance of his administration 's @entity3 on monday			2
he said allowing the targeting groups for their political views was ' outrageous ' @entity116 and other members of the @entity42 sent at least four inquiries to the @entity3 , starting in june 2011			1
@entity161 sen. @entity160 , the top @entity47 on the @entity120 , sent three inquiries			0
and rep. @entity163 , @entity164 , chairman of the @entity165 , sent at least one			0
none of the responses they received from the @entity3 acknowledged that conservative groups had ever been targeted , including a response to @entity160 dated sept. 11 , 2012 - four months after @entity29 had been briefed			1
in several letters to members of @entity30 , @entity29 went into painstaking detail about how applications for tax - exempt status were screened			0
but he never mentioned that conservative groups were being targeted , even though people working under him knew as early as june 2011 that @entity5 groups were being targeted , according to an upcoming report by the agency 's inspector general			1
' it is almost inconceivable to imagine that top officials at the @entity3 knew conservative groups were being targeted but chose to willfully mislead the committee 's investigation into this practice , ' @entity113 said			1
' this revelation goes against the very principles of free speech and liberty upon which this country was founded , and the blatant disregard for which the agency has treated @entity30 and the @entity193 taxpayer raises serious concerns about leadership at the @entity3			2
' the @entity3 issued a statement monday saying that @entity29 had been briefed on may 3 , 2012 ' that some specific applications were improperly identified by name and sent to the [ exempt organizations ] centralized processing unit for further review			2
' under scrutiny : hundreds of small protests , like this one involving the @entity204 , have cropped up in 2013 in opposition to the president 's immigration reform package that was the unit in @entity136 that handled the @entity5 applications			2
@entity29 became acting commissioner in november , after commissioner @entity211 completed his five - year term			0
@entity211 had been appointed by president @entity213			0
on june 29 , 2011 , @entity214 , who heads the @entity3 division that oversees tax - exempt organizations , learned at a meeting that groups were being targeted , according to a draft of the report by the treasury inspector general for tax administration			1
at the meeting , @entity214 was told that groups with ' @entity5 , ' ' @entity225 ' or ' @entity226 ' in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny , the report says			2
@entity214 instructed agents to change the criteria for flagging groups ' immediately			0
' however , when @entity214 responded to inquiries from the @entity165 , she did n't mention the fact that @entity5 groups had ever been targeted			2
influence : @entity5 groups were instrumental in the tide - turning elections of 2010 , when their fervor swept new conservatives to governors ' mansions , statehouses and @entity30 her responses included 45 - page letters in may 2012 to republicans @entity163 , of @entity245 , who chairs the committee , and rep @entity247 , of @entity249 , who chairs a subcommittee			0
@entity214 also met twice with staff from the @entity42 oversight subcommittee to discuss the issue , in march and in may 2012 , according to a timeline constructed by committee staff			0
she did n't mention at either meeting that conservative groups had been targeted , according to the timeline			1
' knowing what we know now , the @entity3 was at best being far from forth coming , or at worst , being deliberately dishonest with @entity30 , ' @entity160 said monday			2
on monday , president @entity151 said he first learned about the issue from news reports on friday			0
@entity263 spokesman @entity262 said the @entity263 counsel 's office was alerted the week of april 22 that the inspector general was finishing a report concerning the @entity3 office in @entity136			1
but , he said , the counsel 's office did not get the report and the president did not learn the focus until friday			0
' if , in fact , @entity3 personnel engaged in the kind of practices that had been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups , then that 's outrageous and there 's no place for it , ' @entity151 said monday at a press conference			1
" and they have to be held fully accountable , because the @entity3 as an independent agency requires absolute integrity , and people have to have confidence that they 're applying it in a non-partisan way , applying the laws in a non-partisan way .			2
