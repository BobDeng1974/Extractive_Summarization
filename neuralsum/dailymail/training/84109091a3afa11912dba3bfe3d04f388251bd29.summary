by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 15 august 2012 @entity2 : 02:03 est , 16 august 2012 @entity3 looks set to trigger demands for an instant end to @entity7 aid handouts after it revealed plans for a £ 50million mission to @entity10			1
prime minister @entity11 made the space journey announcement in a speech marking the 65th anniversary of his country ’s independence from @entity7 rule			2
@entity7 taxpayers are committed to an eight - year , £ 1.6billion package of aid to @entity3 which is due to run until 2015			1
giant leap : @entity3 's maiden lunar mission @entity22 , or @entity23 in ancient @entity24 , is seen successfully took off at the @entity25 in @entity26 , about 63 miles north of @entity27 , in 2008 however , there is growing pressure to end it earlier because of austerity measures in place here			1
mr @entity11 ’s announcement will only fuel the calls			0
he said the unmanned spacecraft would enter orbit around the planet and collect scientific information			0
it is likely to be launched in november 2013 with a rocket developed by the @entity40			0
‘ this spaceship to @entity10 will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology , ’ mr @entity11 said			0
scientists say the spacecraft is expected to take nearly 11 months to get close to @entity10			0
last week , @entity50 ’s new robot rover named @entity51 landed in a huge crater on @entity10 and has begun a host of scientific studies of the planet			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity11 heralded the plan as ' a huge step for us in the area of science and technology ' @entity3 is ramping up its ambitious space programme with confirmation of plans to send a probe to @entity10 the @entity65 earlier this year said it would finally end aid payments to @entity3 , but not until the end of the current programme in three years			1
the average annual spend on @entity3 is about £ 280million a year , even though the now - booming @entity71 giant has had its own space programme for years			1
despite the @entity7 cash , @entity3 rejected a @entity7 - built @entity75 fighter jet as preferred candidate for a £ 13billion defence deal and chose a @entity79 option instead			1
@entity3 ’s former finance minister , @entity80 , has said he did not even want @entity7 ’s aid and that it was just ‘ peanuts ’ in the booming country ’s development expenditure			1
unlike other @entity88 departments , the @entity86 ’s budget is rising by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015			0
and a @entity90 is to be introduced in this @entity91 to enshrine in law the commitment that 0.7 per cent of @entity7 ’s national income will be spent on aid			0
however , polls have shown that 71 per cent of @entity7 disagree with the plan , and that two - thirds of the country believe @entity7 spends too much on international development			2
international development secretary @entity102 , accepting earlier this year that the aid to @entity3 should end , said the @entity3 economy was booming and its own efforts to end poverty were proving more effective			1
‘ i completely understand why people question the aid programme to @entity3 and we questioned it ourselves , ’ he said			1
@entity3 has had an active space programme since the 1960s			1
since the mid- 1970s , it has launched scores of satellites for itself and for nearly two dozen other countries			0
@entity3 sent a spacecraft into orbit around the moon in 2008			2
in all , there have been about 40 missions to @entity10 with just about half of them being successful – with attempts made by the @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity79 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
critics of @entity11 ’s @entity126 say instead of the @entity10 mission , the government should concentrate on providing the basic needs of people such as electricity and safe drinking water			2
two weeks ago , the electricity grids that serve more than 600million @entity3 collapsed for hours in the world ’s largest blackout .			2

the cost of the mission has been *estimated* at *$* 70 - *90million*
yet @entity3 still struggles to tackle poverty and child *malnutrition*
