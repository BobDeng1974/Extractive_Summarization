by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is big on eye contact			1
as he answers each question he locks an intense gaze on you with the focus of a man who knows what it takes to win the @entity11			1
deschamps did that , of course , as @entity14 captain in 1998 and now he is the man in charge of @entity14 , looking to become only the third man after @entity18 ’s @entity17 and @entity20 ’s @entity19 to win the tournament as a player and manager			1
opponents : @entity12 ' side face @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 in @entity30 greatest achievement : @entity2 ( right ) lifts the @entity11 in 1998 with @entity14 on home soil not that he thinks he has any chance of achieving that with a team who were dumped out in the group stage in 2010 and qualified for @entity20 only by the skin of their teeth			1
‘ i ’m going to @entity20 with lots of ambition but i ’m a realist , too , ’ says the 45 - year - old , whose side have been drawn with @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity27 in @entity30 ‘ there are countries that are much better than us on paper			1
we ca n’t hide from the truth			2
the only match that @entity14 won in the group stage of a @entity11 in the last 12 years was against @entity53 in 2006			1
‘ i ca n’t talk about winning the @entity11 , there are teams who are far ahead of us , including a team who won the last @entity11 and the last two @entity59 ( @entity60 )			1
there are six or seven			2
to win it for us would be viewed as a miracle			1
’ after a few minutes in his company it is clear why the former @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 midfielder is so keen on eye contact			2
delighted : @entity71 looked in a good mood ahead of the training session rivals ? @entity76 goalkeeper @entity75 ( right ) arrives with @entity78 striker @entity77 @entity2 revels in human interaction , something he feels has become lost among current players and something he blames for their reputation as spoilt , difficult and badly behaved			1
@entity85 , not selected for the @entity11 because of his attitude , will surely take note			1
‘ managing players is harder these days because of the arrival of new technology , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ they are all using it in their spare time so they become more isolated and selfish			1
they share less , they talk less			2
they have apps , their phones and the internet but they are less used to talking to people			2
‘ nowadays you never see players playing cards			1
we used to sit around playing cards together all the time			2
but i ca n’t fight that , i have to adapt and change			2
‘ so i have to find new ways of getting people to interact because it is still healthy to know whether the guy sitting next to you at dinner has a wife or kids or whatever			2
’ out of reach ? @entity2 admits @entity14 need a miracle to win the @entity11 focused : @entity121 ( right ) with @entity122 in training with the @entity125 squad on sunday what @entity2 feels all his players have in common is vast amounts of money and meddling entourages			1
and it is the latter which concerns him most			0
‘ yes , they have a lot of money but who gives it to them ? it is not their fault			0
where the problem comes is if a player is given lots of money before they have achieved anything in the game			0
because money gives them power			0
‘ what has also changed is that there are so many people around players these days : the agent , the mother , the father , the brother , the sister , the uncle , an adviser			1
‘ you get 20 or so people who are living off the player , their lifestyle is supported by him			0
and they do n’t always give him good advice			0
they need to keep him happy because they need money so they will tell him he is the best and the most beautiful even when he is not			0
‘ that makes a coach ’s job hard			0
it makes the coach look like an idiot for saying the opposite			0
it makes relationships a lot harder			0
’ idol : @entity68 midfielder @entity171 has a picture taken with a fan in @entity174 @entity14 , of course , are no strangers to difficult relationships			1
their last @entity11 campaign was blighted by a players ’ strike after coach @entity181 sent home @entity182			1
there was also talk of unrest throughout their recent qualifying campaign , which ended with a nail - biting 3 - 2 aggregate play - off win over @entity189			1
the same accusations were not levelled at the now immortalised class of ’ 98 , though @entity2 thinks that winning is the only real difference between then and now			1
‘ we were seen as a really good team because we won , ’ he adds			0
‘ we were a bunch of competitive guys all together going after the same prize			0
we were individuals with a common goal			0
‘ you have to find those kind of players because the danger is you end up with people who are going after individual goals rather than collective ones			1
‘ these guys are privileged to be playing for @entity14 at a @entity11			1
’ in search of that balance , @entity2 has blooded plenty of young players over the past two years with mixed success			1
there have been defeats by @entity60 , @entity18 , @entity213 and @entity20 but there was also a recent victory over @entity216 and a return to form for @entity220 striker @entity219 , who had previously been dropped by the manager			1
however , the form and morale of some of his key @entity226 players is not so good			1
captain and goalkeeper @entity75 has endured a frustrating year at stuttering @entity76 , @entity121 ’s future is up in the air , @entity77 ’s form at @entity78 has disintegrated since he was caught with an underwear model in his hotel room ahead of a game , and @entity236 duo @entity235 and @entity237 are caught up in the increasingly bitter atmosphere at @entity239			2
it is a problem of which @entity2 is fully aware			1
back then : @entity2 said in his day the players would constantly play cards , but now with new technologies they are isolated and selfish ‘ for the sake of their confidence , it would be a lot better if they did n’t have problems at their clubs but unfortunately that is what has happened			1
and they might be pleased to get away from that in some ways			0
the only thing is that normally if the club have a good season , the player has a good season			0
i will have three weeks with them after the end of the season to make sure they are ok			0
’ another hot topic of debate in @entity14 is the international form of @entity270			1
while he has dazzled for @entity272 , he has not for his country			0
@entity274 would no doubt sympathise			0
‘ @entity270 is very experienced — he was there in 2006 and then in the tougher times , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ he is a leader for us			0
he is one of the best players in the world but he is a very nice guy , very smiley			2
and on the pitch he can make a big difference			0
him playing as well for us as he does for @entity272 is not just down to him , it is down to the rest of the team			0
‘ we have to help him , too — not just make him feel like he always has to be the one to win the game and make the difference			2
aiming high : @entity14 are outside favourites for the @entity11 ‘ you ca n’t just try to make him another zidane			1
it is like looking for another @entity293			0
following on from a great generation of players is hard			2
i had that after @entity293 retired			0
we missed the 1990 and 1994 @entity297			0
’ what about @entity2 making a difference , using his victory from 1998 to inspire his team to great things ? ‘ they are such good memories			1
winning the @entity11 is the most wonderful thing a footballer can ask for			1
that experience of course helps me but i never talk about it to my players now			2
‘ i have to adapt and deal with the players and the moment			2
it is part of my past , a wonderful thing but not something that has anything to do with my players now			2
i ca n’t be the same as @entity318 ( @entity14 ’s @entity11 - winning coach )			1
he is different to me and my players are different to our team back then			2
‘ every manager i ’ve had is a reference point for me — good or bad			2
there are some that have had more influence than others but i have my personality , too			0
and you have to adapt			0
the same thing does n’t work in two places			0
@entity332 had the biggest influence on me but i like my team to be more attacking			0
better days : @entity2 ( background ) trains with @entity338 at the @entity339 ‘ i want us to have the ball			1
that wo n’t always be possible — if we are playing @entity60 for example — but that is what i am looking for			0
’ @entity2 has been busy watching endless videos of @entity28 , @entity27 and @entity29 — he and @entity347 are the only members of the 1998 squad who are in management — and he is in no doubt about who the favourites are			1
‘ the @entity354 are the favourites for our group			0
they have been better than us in the past two years			0
that ’s why my goal has to just be beating @entity29 on june 15			1
@entity29 might not seem scary to most people but we have to take them seriously			1
‘ i wo n’t pretend that we could n’t have had a harder draw but i remember that we had a very good draw , too , in 2010 — and that did n’t end well			0
we can not underestimate these teams			0
they are not there by accident			0
three @entity367 : @entity2 says @entity368 are more likely to win the @entity11 than @entity14 ‘ the same teams are the favourites to win it : @entity60 , @entity20 , @entity332 , @entity370 , @entity18 , @entity216			1
’ and what about @entity368 ? ‘ after that come @entity368 and @entity373 ! i ’ve met @entity375 plenty of times and they are a strong team still			0
but what is certainly a problem for the national team is the @entity226			0
the best players are foreign so there are n’t many @entity383 players			2
‘ but the top players are playing for top clubs so they are used to high demands , to the necessity of winning every match			2
it is the same for my team			0
’ that ’s why you feel his eyes remain firmly on the prize .			0

@entity2 leads @entity14 to the @entity11 this *summer* as manager , and was a winner as captain in 1998
@entity2 says new technologies mean players are isolated and selfish
@entity125 says of @entity14 *'s* @entity11 chances : ' to win it for us would be viewed as a miracle '
