ever since they were discovered in 1873 , scientists have been trying to find out the origin of the millions of potato - sized metal balls that carpet the world 's oceans			1
known as manganese nodules , these lumps contain valuable metals that scientists someday hope to harvest from the sea floor			1
now @entity11 scientists could be closer to solving the mystery of their origin after stumbling on the largest patch of manganese nodules ever found in the @entity16			1

a remote camera later revealed that the seafloor was littered with these metal rocks ranging in size from golf balls to bowling balls			0
with growth rates of between one to five millimetres in a million years , some of the nodules could be 10 million years old , the researchers said			0
' i was surprised , because this is generally not the place you think of for manganese nodules , ' said @entity42 , chief scientist for the expedition at the @entity44 told @entity45			2

pictured is a stock image of a manganese nodule these metal balls consist of the manganese , iron and other coveted metals such as copper , cobalt or zinc manganese nodules have been found in every ocean , but are most common in the @entity60			1

these particular nodules were found in waters roughly 16,400ft and 18,000ft ( 5,000 and 5,500 metres ) deep			0
one theory as to how they came to be is that they were formed by chemical reactions in seawater that were boosted by microbes			1
another suggests the nodules to form from precipitation of metals from seawater , especially from volcanic thermal vents			1
they consist of the manganese and contain iron and other coveted metals such as copper , cobalt or zinc			0
manganese nodules are scientifically of great interest since they can be used as climate and environmental archives			2

since the 1970s , they have been considered a possible source of raw materials			0
but due to the large water depths and the associated technical complexity and potential environmental damages , no commercial exploitation is currently in sight			0
at the same time , manganese nodules are scientifically of great interest since they can be used as climate and environmental archives			2
manganese nodules grow like a pearl shell around a nucleus and as a result record information on the prevailing environmental conditions			2
since the nodules grow very slowly , they provide a record of the world 's early climate history			0
scientists are now hoping to analyse the nodules in greater detail to understand exactly how they formed			0
they say greater analysis could also unlock the secrets to our planet 's changing climate			1

one theory as to how they came to be is that they were formed by chemical reactions in seawater boosted by microbes the @entity141 , a @entity11 research ship , was a couple of hundred miles east of @entity23 when a net designed to capture a variety of marine life instead caught ancient balls of manganese ore			1

known as manganese nodules , the large lumps contain valuable metal
scientists have been attempting to explain their origin since the 1870s
researchers have now found largest patch of manganese in the @entity16
one theory is they formed from chemical reactions and *bacteria* in water
another suggests nodules were created by metals from volcanic vents
analysis could also unlock the secrets to our planet 's changing climate
