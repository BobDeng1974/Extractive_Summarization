by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:51 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 13 march 2013 embattled @entity4 boss sir @entity3 was accused of ‘ sticking two fingers up to patients ’ yesterday as ministers expressed private astonishment at his appointment of a controversial new deputy			1
both @entity11 and @entity12 criticised the elevation of @entity14 , the former head of the @entity4 in the @entity15 , despite claims that she gagged a whistleblower who was raising concerns about high patient death rates			1
she is understood to dispute the allegations against her but is facing a @entity22 investigation into her conduct			0
appointment : sir @entity3 ( left ) has been criticised by mps for his elevation of @entity14 ( right ) who faces a @entity22 inquiry into her conduct sir @entity3 , who is already facing intense pressure to resign over his role in the @entity32 scandal , in which as many as 1,200 patients died , shocked @entity34 by announcing that @entity14 was to be promoted to be his number two			1
her appointment is temporary while someone is found to fill the role permanently			0
the move comes amid signs that support for the head of the @entity42 is draining away			0
ministers calling for him to be sacked blame a powerful trio – cabinet secretary sir @entity46 , cabinet office minister @entity47 and health secretary @entity48 – for advising the prime minister to keep him on to see through health service reforms			0
government sources said ministers had no right to block the appointment of @entity14 , since the board is independent of government , but were neither consulted or given any notice			1
one minister said of sir @entity3 : ‘ this guy is not exactly racking up points in his favour			1
’ @entity11 mp @entity63 said : ‘ this appears to be a bizarre appointment which sticks two fingers up to @entity4 patients , but is business as usual for the people who are bringing the @entity4 into disrepute			2
’ @entity71 , another @entity63 mp , said the appointment gave the impression of a ‘ tight - knit , mafia - like group centring around @entity3 ’			2
hearing : last week sir @entity3 told @entity12 that gagging orders were ' completely and utterly unacceptable ' @entity77 mp @entity76 said : ‘ someone who seems to have presided over a culture of bullying should not be appointed to this role when the @entity4 needs desperately to move in a new direction			1
’ @entity83 , a @entity11 member of the @entity85 health select committee , said : ‘ there seems to be a managerial class that is dominating the health service , moving from post to post without ever properly answering for their actions elsewhere			2
’ @entity14 is said to have helped authorise a payment of £ 500,000 to silence the chief executive of a hospital trust where 670 patients are feared to have died needlessly			2
she is also being investigated by the @entity22 for allegedly quashing a report into high death rates at the trust , @entity99 , in 2009			1
criticisms : @entity77 mp @entity76 is among the politicians who have criticised the appointment @entity103 , the whistleblower allegedly gagged by @entity14 , was chief executive of @entity104 until 2010 when he was sacked after warning @entity14 that targets were being put ahead of patients			1
he was later given a £ 500,000 payoff on the condition he keep quiet about shocking standards at the hospital			0
last month he broke his silence to claim that @entity14 , then head of the @entity112 supervising the hospital , had ordered him to prioritise targets			2
last week sir @entity3 told @entity12 that gagging orders were ‘ completely and utterly unacceptable			1
’ six days later he promoted @entity14 to be his deputy			1
when asked by mps on the health select committee last tuesday whether he was aware of gagging orders being used in the @entity4 , he said : ‘ i am absolutely against them , and , wherever i see them , i try and stop them			0
’ later he was asked specifically about mr @entity103 ’s gagging order			0
he replied : ‘ it is completely and utterly unacceptable			0
’ health ministers privately concede they do not expect sir @entity3 to cling to his job in the long - term – but fear him being replaced by another proponent of @entity77 ’s ‘ command and control ’ approach to the @entity4			1
no one at the @entity132 was available for comment			0
appearing before a committee of senior mps last night , @entity134 was challenged over the failure to hold anyone accountable for the @entity140 scandal			0
@entity11 mp @entity141 said there appeared to be an ‘ unspoken conspiracy ... that somehow the ministers are not responsible because the officials or people down the line were responsible , but we ca n’t hold the officials accountable because of the doctrine of ministerial accountability			2
’ the prime minister said the independent report into the scandal had cautioned against creating ‘ scapegoats ’ and had suggested that the main responsibility lay with the local hospital management and board			0
‘ the tragedy is that they were n’t held properly accountable at the time , ’ the prime minister added .			0
