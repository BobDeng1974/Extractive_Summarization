their faces covered in elaborate black patterns and , in some cases , totally dark with ink , these smiling villagers are some of @entity6 's last surviving tattooed women			1
a custom that , according to legend , began when an ancient king tried to make slaves of the women , the inkings were first intended to repel incomers and then became a symbol of beauty			0
but with younger people increasingly reluctant to be inked for fear of ridicule and for fear of the heavy fines imposed by the ruling military junta , @entity6 's tattooing tradition is on borrowed time and could disappear within a generation			1
sign of beauty : the women of the @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 tribes say facial tattoos are a sign of beauty customs : the tradition exists alongside other customs such as playing the flute through the nose			1
a @entity42 woman is pictured			0
isolated : the tribes live far from the @entity6 capital @entity45 in a mountainous area that was cut off until two years ago fines : the military junta has done its best to eradicate the tattoo tradition and levies a hefty fine of half a cow on anyone who gets one meaning : each of the facial tattoos is replete with symbols , although the most frequently seen design is the spider 's web ( pictured ) variation : these women , both from the @entity30 tribe , have less prominent tattoos than those from the @entity32 and @entity31 peoples attractive : this lady told @entity67 that her spider 's web tattoo caught men like the real thing catches flies as a result , few women now have the markings , with the majority of those who do living hidden away in the mountainous @entity30 , @entity78 and @entity78 regions - all of which were closed off to visitors until two years ago			1
now an estimated 700 tourists travel to the area each year , although few are inclined to attempt the precipitous climb up to the mountain eyries of the @entity31 , @entity30 and @entity32 tribes			1
those who do will be rewarded with a warm welcome - and a glimpse into one of @entity90 's oldest , and most threatened , cultures			0
most of the tattooed women boast spider 's web designs which , as one villager quipped to @entity67 , ' attract the men like a spider 's web catches insects '			0
others bear full - face tattoos , with every part of their face covered in ink - again , a symbol of beauty			2
so popular did the look become , one elderly lady , @entity107 from the remote @entity109 village , revealed that women who chose not to have it ' looked ugly to all the men '			0
must - have : the tattoos are thought to be an ancient custom that arose in response to a slave - hungry king			0
it was supposed to make girls ugly mandatory : in the centuries that followed , the tattoos became a sign of beauty and were insisted upon by parents generation gap : although @entity129 has facial tattoos , her granddaughter @entity128 ( left ) has refused to have them for fear of ridicule all black : @entity107 , who says her tattoos took three days to complete , says an all - black face was once thought to be the most attractive youngest : 67 - year - old miss @entity138 is one of the youngest women to have the tattoos in @entity141			1
she was tattooed by her grandmother delicate : women of the @entity30 tribe have smaller and more delicate tattoos that only cover part of the face painful : the facial tattoos are made using thorns ( pictured ) and ink made from a mixture of pig fat , cow bile , plants and soot toothless : many of the women regularly chew betel nuts which results in tooth loss and brown stains on the rest the tattoos , which are created using thorn needles and an ink made from a mixture of cow bile , soot , plants and pig fat , are also a sign of bravery - particularly those etched on the neck , which are the most painful of all			1
in the past , women who tried to avoid being tattooed found themselves thrown into the family pig pen where , says @entity107 , they stayed until they changed their minds and submitted to the procedure			0
now , however , the tables have been turned on the tribesmen , with the brutal military junta that dominated the country until 2011 declaring the tattoos illegal and imposing harsh fines on anyone to break the rules			1
although the country is currently undergoing a political renewal under current president , @entity190 , the fines remain in place - and as a result , fewer and fewer women are getting the tattoos			2
other tribal customs , such as changing a woman 's name when she becomes a mother , remain intact , as does a continuing belief in the power of the village shaman and his totems			0
high on @entity203 in a @entity30 village called @entity205 , the skulls of pigs and buffaloes sacrificed during shamanic ceremonies adorn each house , while outside , the family totems are arranged in a wooden palisade			2
@entity213 lives : all three tribes live in remote mountain villages and , as a result , are still adept at handicrafts and believe in shamans few visitors : the @entity203 area in which they live was closed to outsiders until two years ago			1
now 700 tourists arrive each year @entity224 : to the tribespeople , all foreigners are ' @entity224 ' - a legacy from the @entity229 's time as the colonial power in @entity6 pale : they also believe that white skin is the result of boiling the individual concerned in water smoke break : nearly all the women smoke pipes , although their frequent smoke breaks do n't seem to affect their ability to move around relaxed : most of the women smoke tobacco in their clay pipes , from which they are rarely parted no problem : the women 's daily routine , which involves heavy lifting and mountainous paths , is seemingly unaffected by their smoking hard work : for the @entity30 , @entity256 and @entity31 ( @entity30 pictured ) women , life revolves around collecting water and gathering food most homes have a small post topped with an egg beside their front doors , which according to local lore , is a way to bring the family good luck and happiness , while also repelling evil spirits			1
other @entity30 traditions include a ban on men eating meat in his wife 's family 's home in case it brings bad luck and an emphasis on having sons who will , should a family member be murdered , be expected to avenge their death in person			2
that many of the @entity30 , @entity285 and @entity31 traditions , including , rather charmingly , a penchant for playing the flute using the nose , exist intact only because of the villages ' remoteness			2
although many villagers have left in search of work in @entity45 , the capital of @entity6 , and in countries such as @entity295 , those who remain live much as they always have - without electricity and with sightings of foreigners few and far between			0
with so few visitors , any @entity301 to appear in the village is immediately deemed to be @entity224 - a hangover from the colonial times			2
amusingly , many of locals remain convinced that white skin is the result that person being boiled			1
but , as with their tattoos , the future looks uncertain for the @entity30 and other @entity6 tribes , whose traditions are beginning to be eroded by incomers - not least in the @entity317 teachers who teach the children different traditions and a different language			1
in @entity326 village only six tattooed women , all of whom are now in their 80s , remain			0
they truly are the last of their kind			0
@entity329 : the people still believe in totems such as pig skulls ( left behind boy ) and eggs , which are thought to bring good luck and happiness family : @entity339 totems represent different stages in a family 's life			0
each is paid for with a buffalo so the more there are , the richer the family extra money : most of the tribes are self - sufficient but make extra money through weaving and basket making housework : women do all the cooking and housework			0
the tribes say it brings bad luck if men cook @entity358 : the tribes live deep in the mountains in small villages that cling precariously to the steep slopes spectacular : many live on @entity203 ( pictured ) , which is too steep for most visitors to navigate			2

the @entity256 , @entity31 and @entity30 tribes of remote north - *western* @entity6 consider tattoos a sign of beauty
women bear elaborate inked patterns that cover their whole face , with many also having them on their neck
tattoo culture is under threat after being banned by @entity6 's military junta and *punished* with huge fines
many tribal villages are high on @entity203 and were completely cut off by the regime until two years ago
any foreigner is deemed ' @entity224 ' by the tribes who think white skin is the result of boiling the person concerned
