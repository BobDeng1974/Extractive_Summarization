speaking to @entity22 , mr @entity11 has revealed how the madness continued throughout the duration of the two - day trip - not all of it positive though			1
@entity11 ( right ) booked a trip to @entity2 with friend @entity12 ( left ) after a night in @entity9 ' going out there was the roughest part in all honesty , as we were both suffering from hangovers , but once we got to @entity2 , we threw ourselves into it , ' said the 33 - year - old company director			1
' it was a crazy decision to make , booking flights out there after a session on the beers , but i do n't regret it at all , it was a brilliant trip and a truly crazy experience			0
' we knew some lads out there , and there 's a big community from the @entity47 , so it was great to catch up with people			0
' we were out all the time , going for meals and having drinks in bars and pubs , we did n't get the chance to travel around much			0
' mr @entity11 , who paid £ 550 for a return flight and £ 60 for a two - night stay in @entity57 , revealed that he decided to upgrade his luggage after only heading out with a @entity60 bag ' full of boxers and t - shirts '			1
the pair of friends from @entity9 met up with @entity65 ( right ) in the @entity67 pub in @entity68 mr @entity11 ( left ) had his trainers stolen ; mr @entity12 ( right ) grabs some much needed rest before the flight home ' when i got there i bought a bag and some trainers from @entity76 , ' he added			1
however , on checking out of one hotel after their first night 's stay , mr @entity11 fell on some hard luck			1
' we were checking out , and there was a bit of confusion			0
one guy started to get involved in the conversation , we had no idea who he was			0
@entity11 , 33 , ( far left ) and friend @entity12 , 33 , ( second left ) pictured with friends they met in @entity2 the pair flew from @entity92 to @entity57 , @entity2 with a stopover in @entity94 ' the next minute i looked down and my trainers had gone - he must have had his eye on them and that 's why he came over			1
' determined not to let the theft ruin his holiday , mr @entity11 continued the party - matching up shorts with a pair of black shoes			1
' we got to @entity68 , and decided we had to get a motorbike as the taxi was n't going anywhere and it was really busy , ' he added			0
' but there was no way i was getting on one barefoot , so i reached into my bag and pulled out my brogues and off we went			0
' @entity12 and @entity11 chill out with an old friend over some beers in @entity68 , while right , a bleary - eyed @entity116 makes his way into a taxi the friends relax in the airport lounge on the way back from @entity2 after their epic two - day trip the pair had arranged through @entity126 to meet an old friend , @entity65 , who was in @entity2 at the time			1

' it was great to catch up with people we knew , and it was just a brilliant trip , ' added mr @entity11			1
' it was definitely worth doing for the sheer craic of it			0
' it 's been somewhat of a comedown for mr @entity11 since he returned to the @entity47 on monday , and he has found himself behind with his work			2
' going away has meant i 've let some people down in work terms , and that 's never easy , ' he added			0
' i 'm finding myself a bit behind now , but i would n't swap our experience for anything			0
' his friend , however , might have some more pressing explaining to do , as mr @entity11 explained			2
' @entity12 's got a girlfriend , and it was a real battle just to get hold of his passport to head out to @entity2			2
' but it 's only two days we were out there , not two weeks , so i 'm hoping he should be ok			0
