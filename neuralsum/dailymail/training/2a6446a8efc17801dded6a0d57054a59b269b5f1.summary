@entity19 is battling to contain a series of scandals which have hit @entity1 over the past week @entity1 mep @entity22 played down the revelations - claiming they were ' hand grenades rolling down the corridor ' in recorded comments passed to the @entity29 , mr @entity27 said the party needed to become more disciplined , he said : ‘ one of the things that @entity1 has lacked as a party — and looking at it the way i ’ve been able to from the outside — discipline is one of the things that ’s really been missing			1
‘ half my job is spent not finding good candidates to stand , it is weeding out the lunatics , the people who should n’t be there			1
’ mr @entity6 had even resorted to ‘ doing tests to make sure people were vaguely sane and that they could string their words together more or less ’ , @entity1 's @entity47 mep @entity46 said			1
mr @entity27 ’s role vetting party candidates was thrown into the spotlight last week over his failure to spot a series of glaring errors on the cv of leading @entity1 candidate @entity58			1

mrs @entity58 told the @entity92 ’s @entity91 : ‘ i did n’t sleep with @entity66 , end of			2
’ but he insisted : ‘ for the record , yes she did			2
’ the scandal came after a series of tape - recorded phone calls were leaked to @entity98 , showing party candidate @entity75 , chosen to fight @entity1 target seat of @entity100 in @entity101 making a series of offensive remarks			1
in the tape he mocks ‘ f * * * ing disgusting old pooftahs ’ who belong to a @entity109 group , calling them ‘ @entity111 ’ – bacon , lettuce and tomato			1
he also jokes about ‘ shooting peasants ’ and refers to a woman with a @entity118 name as a ‘ @entity119			2
’ but mr @entity19 last night refused to sack mr @entity75			1
a well - placed @entity1 official said : ‘ @entity75 wants to make a full apology and is hoping it all blows over			1
’ @entity1 mep @entity123 today defended mr @entity75 - claiming he had been drugs at the time			1
he said : “ this was a phone call sometime ago while he was on sedatives by his own account , not really speaking , thinking rationally			0
he was on prescription sedatives after suffering an injury			0
' but he said : ' using derogatory terminology , this slang , is not right at this level of politics and you should n’t do it			0
' ' clearly what he said there is unacceptable			0
he ’s apologised unreservedly , there are big mitigating circumstances , it ’s from some time ago , and we ’re willing now to judge him on his performance going forward from this			2

@entity1 activists are urged to rate each on a scale from 0 for ‘ not close at all ’ to 10 for ‘ very close			0

mrs @entity190 , who won a campaign against the @entity193 in her @entity195 constituency in east @entity196 , said : ‘ this openly brings race into politics			0
it ’s shameful , it ’s shocking and it ’s offensive			0
' it lifts the lid on the unacceptable face of @entity1			0
’ the survey comes after a series of claims of racism involving @entity1 , although @entity19 has insisted ‘ stupid or offensive ’ comments by a handful of candidates ‘ never have and never will ’ represent the views of his party			1
