by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 14:29 est , 10 december 2012 a mother whose daughter was strangled to death by her wealthy ex-boyfriend has revealed how she tormented the killer with handwritten cards in a bid to get him to speak about what he had done			1
@entity9 found her daughter , 32 - year - old @entity10 , in a pool of blood in her luxury @entity13 , @entity14 apartment after she was murdered in the early hours of @entity15 , 2009			1
more than two years later , @entity10 's ex-boyfriend , @entity16 , was found guilty of strangling her and beating her beloved pet dog to death after he was unable to deal with their break up			1
speaking with @entity20 , which recounted the often troubled investigation in a special episode , mrs @entity9 revealed how she tormented @entity23 for the months leading up to his trial			1
' ' i wanted him to know i was thinking about him and that he needed to think about me , ' she said			0
another card read : ' @entity39 the same ' , while an email sent from her daughter 's account read : ' how long were you planning this murder ? ' ' remember how you ended her life ' another card read , with a photo enclosed , with the words : ' @entity15			2
' in the 2011 trial of @entity9 , in which he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison , defense attorneys attacked her for what they branded ' harassment ' - but she stood by her actions			1
heartbroken : her mother , @entity59 , sent @entity23 a series of cards ' harassing ' him after the murder unrelenting : she sent cards on special occasions ' so he knew i was thinking about him ' , she said demanding : other messages were more direct , such as this email sent from @entity10 's account ' what does a mother do when she 's seen her daughter laying in a pool of blood ? ' she said			1
she sent the letters as investigators and prosecutors began building their case against @entity16 , 43 , who had dated @entity10 for two - and - a - half years before she broke up with him in october 2008			1
following the break up , @entity23 , a well - educated man from one of the area 's ' best ' families , sent her letters describing his heartbreak and how he was unable to sleep			1
' i need you to know that i am deeply saddened , hurt and disappointed at the sudden termination of our relationship , ' he wrote on a card , dated october 1 , 2008 , shown at the trial			2
' i just lie in bed crying over this tremendous loss and loneliness i now feel ... i wish you would reconsider ... you are the person i want to spend the rest of my life with and raise a family with ! ' killed : two weeks after her death , her beloved dog @entity102 ( pictured ) was found killed and dumped in a field just before @entity107 , @entity16 asked @entity10 to his house to talk about the break up			1
mrs @entity9 explained : ' she told me that it had been a really hard meeting			0
he was going on and on and crying and she was worried and she said , " finally , i just had to leave , mother "			2
' but the two shared the same circle of friends and went to the same @entity114 , although @entity16 left before midnight and claimed he was heading home			1
his early departure came after he had been left upset by a game of word association , where two of @entity10 's friends teased him after he was given the word ' marriage ' , they said at the trial			2
@entity10 left after midnight and returned to her condo complex			0
scene : she was found by her mother face down on the bathroom floor , pictured , in a pool of blood but after she failed to pick up her family 's dozens of calls on @entity15 , they went to her apartment and found her lifeless body face down in the bathroom , with a towel over her head			1
arrest : her ex-boyfriend , @entity16 , denied the murder but phone records placed him at the scene ' i opened the door and i yelled for @entity10 and there was no sound back and no dogs , ' her father @entity143 said			1
' she was lying on the bathroom floor in a big pool of blood			0
and i felt her leg and it was cold			0
' her mother added : ' i kneeled on the floor next to her and pushed the towel off of her head and looked at her beautiful green eyes			2
i have no idea how long i was there			2
it was ' til the police made me get up and leave			0
' yet authorities initially believed she had slipped in the bathroom and ruled it accidental - until the autopsy found the cause of death was ligature strangulation			1
her apartment showed no signs of a robbery but a rolled up carpet , scattered belongings and smeared blood also raised alarm bells			0
' when i heard , i just knew it had been deeply personal just because of the way the killing was perpetrated , ' @entity10 's friend , @entity176 , told @entity20			0
police turned to her heartbroken ex-boyfriend , who denied he had anything to do with the death and said he had immediately gone home to bed after the party			0
but grainy surveillance footage outside her condo complex filmed a white truck - like that belonging to @entity23 - waiting outside the building in the early hours of january 1			1
footage also caught a person walking into her building after she arrived home			0
in court : @entity16 , 43 , was found guilty of the murder in 2011 and sentenced to 40 years in prison cell phone records also showed that , when he received calls that night , signal bounced off towers near her home , rather than his own , and placed him at the scene for more than an hour - and - a - half			1
records taken later that morning placed him two miles from her apartment , where @entity10 's murdered @entity210 dog , @entity102 , was found two weeks after her death			1
two of @entity10 's friends also claimed they had gone to @entity16 's home after the party to drop off a beer cooler he had left behind , but did not see his car in his driveway			1
and dna on the towel also matched @entity23 's - yet his attorneys argued that he had been at the apartment as recently as 10 days before her death , so his dna would be on her belongings			2
it was not the only troublesome piece of evidence in the case			0
investigators lost her fingernail clippings and the underwear she was wearing when she was killed			0
loved : @entity27 ' family remembered her as a loving sister and daughter committed to her pets breakdown : @entity23 had written her begging letters after she broke up with him after more than two years they also misplaced clearer surveillance footage and instead had to rely on the grainier images , which did not even make the gender of the figure clear			1
' there were points in the case that we were despairing , that we were depressed , ' prosecutor @entity241 said			0
' we knew he did it ... my biggest fear was that justice might not be done here			0
' but at trial , @entity16 was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 40 years in prison			1
' i guess what was a little bit of amazing was i could feel all my daughter 's good memories come back to me without @entity16 in all of that , ' mrs @entity9 said			2
' i felt like i had her back			0
' @entity16 is appealing his conviction			2
he will be eligible for parole in 20 years			0
and for now , all her family can do is mourn the loss of the caring animal lover , sister and daughter			0
' she was just always full of life and love , ' @entity10 's brother , @entity266 , said			0
' the ultimate @entity270 girl			0
' see below for video			0
