millions of people were cramming themselves aboard trains on @entity3 's huge rail network yesterday , desperate to make it home in time for the @entity6 holiday			1
with most boats and trains full to overflowing , there were serious safety fears			2
these were realised in at least one spot where a man was killed after falling under a train			0
horrified onlookers , including several children , crowded around the victim 's remains , which were scattered in at least two places along the tracks near @entity21 in @entity22 , the capital			2
with nearly @entity58 comprising 90 per cent of @entity3 's 160million people and a population density higher than the tiny island of @entity62 , the scale of the exodus is beyond biblical			0
@entity6 , @entity63 's ' @entity6 ' , commemorates 's @entity45 's willingness to kill his own son in submission to @entity47 's command			1
it begins tonight and lasts for four days			0
this year the preparations for the holiday have been thrown into controversy after officials warned millions of cows set for slaughter have been fattened up with banned steroids			1
industry officials told the @entity77 news agency at least ten million cows and goats are expected to be slaughtered during the festival			0
but experts fear many have been fattened with cancer - causing steroids in a bid to cash in on the surging demand for meat			1
' in our estimate some 20 per cent of the cattle to be sold during @entity6 are being fattened with banned steroids such as dexamethasone , ' said @entity93 , a professor of animal science at the @entity95			1
cows fattened with such steroids can help farmers earn an extra $ 400 - $ 1,000 per animal but can cause serious health problems for consumers , he said			1
' as a result , the use of steroids and other harmful drugs has become rampant all over the country , ' he told @entity77			0
everyone 's on the move : with nearly @entity58 comprising 90 per cent of @entity3 's 160million people and a population density higher than the tiny island of @entity62 , the scale of the exodus is beyond biblical anywhere there 's space : men and youths clamber aboard this train , or hang on to the doorts helping hands : people help a man to escape the sweltering carriage and climb up to the fresh air on the roof @entity127 , joint secretary at the livestock ministry , said only a small number of farmers were using the steroids , with the vast majority using a government - prescribed natural cow fattening formula			1
but he said authorities have deployed 20 medical teams in @entity22 's cattle markets to try to detect sick animals and more teams were being sent to major markets across the country			0
' we are also asking the authorities to deploy magistrates to act against the use of steroids to fatten cows			0
these magistrates will set up mobile courts to hand out sentences against the perpetrators , ' he told @entity77			0
on monday the mass - circulation @entity154 ran an investigative report that said almost every farm in the country 's northwest , the main cattle region , was using the banned steroids			2
' if someone consumes the meat of the cattle fattened with such steroids , it may cause cancer and kidney failure , ' @entity162 , a professor of @entity95 , told the paper			2
acting on a petition , the @entity171 on monday asked the government to investigate the racket and prepare guidelines for its control			0
they 're off : the lush vegetation of the fertile @entity180 whips past these passengers on the train roof not quite a refreshments trolley : but it 's still possible to get a snack on the roof of the @entity6 express @entity6 is the second of @entity63 's two @entity6 holidays , after @entity188 , and marks the end of the annual @entity191 pilgrimage to @entity192			1
like @entity188 , the holiday involves special religious observances , charitable donations , social and family get - togethers , gift giving and traditional @entity199 feasting			0
but , reflecting its scriptural basis , there is also the added element of sacrifice , with many families offering up a sheep , goat or even a cow - with one third of the meat given to the poor and the needy .			1

@entity6 is @entity63 's ' @entity6 '
it commemorates @entity45 's willingness to sacrifice his son to @entity47
many families will sacrifice a sheep , goat or cow as part of their *celebration*
but there are fears much livestock has been *illegally* fattened with steroids
