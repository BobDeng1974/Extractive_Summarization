arrest : @entity0 was found dead at home two days after being accused of drink - driving by police a ‘ perfect son ’ killed himself two days after being arrested for drink - driving because he believed he had ‘ ruined his future ’			1
@entity8 , described as an ‘ exemplary student ’ , was found in his family ’s farmhouse alongside a shotgun and a police charge sheet			1
@entity8 , 17 , was caught drink - driving on his way home from a party just four weeks after passing his driving test			1
he was kept in the cells overnight at @entity21 police station in @entity22 without his parents ’ knowledge			1
two days later he used his father ’s shotgun to kill himself at the £ 850,000 family farm in @entity28 , @entity29			1
the charge sheet and a letter were at his feet when his father found him			1
following his death , his parents @entity34 and @entity36 successfully lobbied the government to change the law so that 17 - year - olds are treated as children in custody			1
an inquest into @entity8 ’s death heard the model pupil – who had recently gained one a and four bs in his as - levels – was working on his university application and travel plans and had shown no signs of depression or anxiety			1
but the note found next to his body said he feared being a ‘ constant disappointment ’ and felt his arrest had ‘ ruined his future ’			1
the jury at @entity61 heard that @entity8 was kept in a police cell overnight after being arrested in august 2012			2
the youngster was driving his new @entity65 home from a party with his friends when he was stopped by police and breathalysed			2
he was over the legal limit and was taken to a police station , where he was detained for more than seven hours overnight			2
his parents were unaware he had been arrested			2
mr @entity8 , 53 , who runs a building supplies company with his wife , said : ‘ he was 17 and had been treated as an adult and i said straight away that was wrong			0
there was an anomaly in the system			0
’ cctv showing @entity8 arriving at the police station and undergoing further searches and tests was shown to the jury			2
as the footage was played , mrs @entity36 , 49 , left the courtroom			2
mr @entity8 said of @entity8 ’s letter : ‘ what he means by that is he can see himself being a disappointment in the future			0
he had never been a disappointment – he was a very high achiever , he did everything that was asked of him			1
father : @entity95 told an inquest that @entity0 was a ' perfect son ' who had never disappointed the family ‘ he was a perfect son and loved by everyone			1
he thought he ’d ruined his future and he would n’t be able to reach the standards he wanted to reach			0
’ @entity8 ’s family did not know of his drink - driving arrest until after his death because he was treated as an adult in custody without the need for a parent or guardian			1
his parents have successfully campaigned for a change in the law to see anyone aged 17 or under treated as a child in custody			0
the previous age limit was 16			0
in a statement , the @entity115 said @entity8 had made a ‘ bad decision ’ to drive after the party			0
they added : ‘ we were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed			0
campaign : @entity0 's parents @entity34 and @entity36 outside the @entity123 after winning a change in the law ‘ the fact that a 17 - year - old is treated as an adult while in custody is an anomaly of @entity132 law			1
once they are charged , they are then treated as children			0
this simply does not make sense			0
for someone of any age , being held and charged in a police station is a traumatic experience			0
‘ few 17 - year - olds could make a rational judgement about contacting family or legal advice in that situation without support			0
perhaps most importantly of all , they are fearful of disappointing and letting down their families			0
we believe if the law had been different , @entity0 would still be alive			2
