@entity0 have been given a boost after @entity3 's governing body tweaked the rules to allow @entity5 , the team 's new partner , to develop their engine this season in line with rival manufacturers			1
the @entity13 company , who have replaced @entity15 at @entity0 , are returning to @entity3 as the sport 's fourth engine supplier			1
@entity15 , @entity18 and @entity19 are allowed to introduce limited upgrades during the season but @entity5 , as a new entrant , had been told to present their engine for approval on february 28 with no further development permitted			1
@entity0 have reunited with @entity5 for the 2015 @entity3 season @entity5 met @entity28 officials last monday to present their view that the situation was unfair			1
a document issued to teams on friday by @entity3 race director @entity33 did not name @entity5 but clarified the situation with an amendment in their favour			2
' as each of the four 2015 manufacturers will have an homologated power unit at the start of the season , we believe it would be fair to ensure that each of them enjoys equal opportunities for upgrades during the season , ' it said			2
' we will therefore allow the new manufacturer to use the same number of tokens that the other three manufacturers have available to them , taken as an average of the three			0
@entity56 drives the new car in testing in @entity59 at the end of last season ' for example , if the three 2014 manufacturers have eight , seven and five unused tokens respectively at the start of the season , then the new manufacturer will be allowed to use six during the season , ' the current manufacturers are allowed to improve their engine using a complicated system of ' tokens ' within set limits			0
tne tokens are assigned to parts of the engine and divided into three categories , meaning that some parts require more than others and manufacturers must choose which areas to improve			0
there are 66 tokens and the existing manufacturers can use 32 during the course of 2015 , with the number reduced over time so that by 2018 there will be only 15 tokens available			0
@entity5 , who partnered @entity0 from 1988 to 1992 when they won four constructors ' titles , quit @entity3 as a constructor at the end of 2008			1
@entity0 have not won a race since 2012 and finished fifth last year			0
double world champion @entity93 has now joined from @entity19 to partner @entity95 's @entity94			0
the season starts in @entity97 on march 15 , with champions @entity15 again expected to set the pace after a dominant @entity100			2
