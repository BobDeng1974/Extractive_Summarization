talk about ripping the heart out of a home — or , in this case , a socking great country mansion in @entity4			1
@entity5 , the ten - bedroom bolt - hole that the @entity7 and @entity8 are renovating , until recently boasted one of those stunning , hand - crafted kitchens that is the stuff of over-excitable dreams			1
no luxury was spared : there was an £ 11,000 @entity15 , an £ 8,000 fridge and inset @entity17 sinks			1
the floor space outstripped that of most entire homes , the work - tops were gleaming hardwood , even the draining board cost £ 275			1
in short , it was the kind of room most families would die for			0
barely a week after we learned that she is having a second kitchen installed in her @entity31 apartment , we hear that most of the £ 50,000 kitchen at @entity33 is to go , in favour of the young royals ’ ‘ own taste ’			1
it is , of course , profligate madness — and as far as harmful reputations go , ‘ @entity42 ’ could well be outstripped by ‘ @entity41 ’			0
not surprisingly , the widespread reaction on @entity44 yesterday was one of disbelief and fury			0
‘ to discard a new , serviceable kitchen is an utter waste and is not likely to endear them to a hard - pressed public , ’ wrote a reader from @entity49			1
‘ what they ’ve forgotten — or are insensitive to — is that millions of their “ subjects ” still struggle to survive in @entity56 , ’ said another			0
@entity59 , from @entity60 , though , spoke for me : ‘ please , may i have the old kitchen ? ’ and perhaps most pertinent of all , from @entity65 in @entity66 : ‘ @entity63 would consider that extremely wasteful			2
’ barely a week after we learned that @entity41 is having a second kitchen installed in her @entity31 apartment , we hear that most of the £ 50,000 kitchen at @entity33 is to go , in favour of the young royals ' ' own taste ' quite so			1
but the @entity63 is an octogenarian who holds dear the austere values of her time			0
@entity41 is both young and rich , and the truth is that we really should not be surprised that she loves to splash the cash			0
there is another reason : few people in the public eye are as ‘ on trend ’ as is @entity41 , and few trends have established themselves as rapidly as that which has made today ’s kitchen the most fashionable of contemporary status symbols			2
outstripping cars , pools , tennis courts and all the rest of the visibly extravagant paraphernalia available , the kitchen now is paramount			2
nothing demonstrates the stylish qualities of one ’s ‘ own taste ’ quite as definitively as the area of the house where dirty pots and pans are made clean again			0
nobody worth their @entity104 sea salt buys a new home and lives with — ugh — the ‘ taste ’ of the previous owner			2
inevitably , no sooner has the removal van left than the old units , fridge and manky hobs are quickly torn out and a skip arrives to carry them off			0
sometimes , the daftness beggars belief			0
and in the case of @entity41 and @entity121 , their decision to replace a gorgeous £ 50,000 kitchen comes at a time when eyebrows have already been raised at the cost to the taxpayer of refurbishing their apartment of 20 - plus rooms at @entity31 which has quadrupled from its estimate to £ 4 million			1
in the case of @entity41 and @entity121 , their decision to replace a gorgeous £ 50,000 kitchen comes at a time when eyebrows have already been raised at the cost to the taxpayer of refurbishing their apartment of 20 - plus rooms at @entity31 which has quadrupled from its estimate to £ 4 ¿ million even though the couple paid for most of the fixtures and fittings — as well they should , since @entity121 is a millionaire courtesy of his mother @entity145 ’s inheritance — the bill for their son @entity147 ’s nursery has been picked up by taxpayers			1
the fripperies that , once , @entity41 seemed to eschew also seem to be mounting			0
a nice little trip to the five - star @entity153 in the @entity155 ? a £ 6,500 - a - night rest - break , laid on for them during their three - week tour of the @entity159 ? that ’ll do nicely , they have apparently decided			1
none , by themselves , appear too shocking			0
but added up ? it ’s not a good look			0
then , of course , there ’s that second kitchen at her @entity31 apartment			1
@entity5 , the ten - bedroom bolt - hole that the @entity7 and @entity8 are renovating , until recently boasted the stunning , hand - crafted kitchen this trend for swanky kitchens , like so many others , is based on a strange inverted snobbery			1
among the wealthy classes , the kitchen used to be the domain of servants ; rarely , if ever , would the mistress of the house descend the stairs and absolutely never the master			2
yet now , even high up the social scale , people relish the chance to settle over a spag bol at the kitchen table			2
famously , the so - called @entity191 set — ruled by @entity192 and @entity193 , @entity195 ’s @entity194 and former newspaper editor @entity196 — regularly shared ‘ kitchen suppers ’			1
our kitchen obsession would be understandable if it were accompanied by an increase in people cooking good , wholesome meals from fresh , quality ingredients and making themselves and their families healthier in the process			2
while the @entity56 have an insatiable appetite for watching celebrity chefs offering countless recipes on tv , they then usually get out a frozen ready - meal			0
for her part , the usually down - to - earth @entity8 of @entity212 should concentrate on cooking up a strategy to avoid being seen as @entity41 .			0
