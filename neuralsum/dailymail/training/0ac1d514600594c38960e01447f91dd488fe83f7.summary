by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 : 13:12 est , 31 december 2013 @entity3 : 14:10 est , 31 december 2013 one of @entity1 ’s most publicized celebrations of the legalization of the sale of recreational marijuana has been cancelled , just hours before the @entity8 brings an end to the state of @entity12 's prohibition of the drug			1
the @entity1 took the extraordinary step of hand - delivering a letter threatening to rescind the liquor license of the downtown venue at which the party , dubbed @entity19 , was due to be staged			1
the letter also threatened legal action against all sponsors and participants in the all - day party , planned by cannabis tourism company 420tours			1
cancelled : party organizer @entity26 had planned to hold a celebration of the new rules on marijuana the move serves as a warning shot for any who view the @entity8 and the new law as heralding a free - for - all for public cannabis consumption			1
in a statement to @entity37 , 420tours founder and party organizer @entity26 said : ‘ it is unfortunate that the @entity1 has chosen to take such a hardline stance against the idea of adults assembling to legally celebrate the unprecedented milestone represented by @entity45			2
’ @entity19 had been intended as the major organized celebration of the historic legal change			2
organizers had hoped to stage the party at the city ’s @entity50 but at 4pm on friday afternoon @entity52 of @entity53 and @entity54 delivered a letter to club owners			2
the letter stated : ‘ we … dissuade you from hosting the event ; however , if you go forward , we will exercise any and all options available to the @entity1 to halt the event and hold the business owners responsible for violations of law			2
‘ we are also ready to hold individual attendees responsible for violations of @entity1 ordinances prohibiting public consumption of marijuana			0
’ on monday afternoon , after much argument and negotiation , mr @entity26 and the club owners admitted defeat			0
barred : an all - day party , due to be held at @entity77 dance bar , has been shut down new era : @entity12 marijuana growing facilities and dispensaries have been preparing for the new rules , with the introduction of marijuana - infused drinks munchies : edible marijuana products are also being introduced in the state it is the clearest sign yet that the @entity1 , under statewide and even worldwide scrutiny , is determined that the licensed sale of marijuana on january 1 should not be confused with a free - for - all in public consumption of the drug			1
but it is a bitter blow for mr @entity26 , who said it is too late to find another venue for the highly publicized event			0
he said : ' it is disingenuous for the city to tell the world that @entity12 is open for business when such major questions remain regarding what happens after " seed to sale " when the whole point of amendment 64 is to responsibly consume cannabis without fear or retaliation			1
' in reality , though the sale of cannabis in licensed premises is legal , public consumption is not and mr @entity26 is one of many pushing for the nascent legislation to go further and permit public consumption , as well as sale , albeit under controlled circumstances			1
but , with @entity12 under intense public scrutiny , it is perhaps unsurprising that those tasked with enforcing the new law on january 1 should be concerned with just that and remain intolerant of any attempts to stretch it beyond the liberties so newly granted			1
know the law : @entity130 , executive director of the @entity131 , points at some of the laws that will accompany the legalization of recreational marijuana on january 1 @entity45 is the first legislation to set up a framework to regulate and tax sales of recreational marijuana			1
it not only decriminalizes it but establishes a legal market for the drug , licensing cultivation , processing and retail			0
it is illegal to give or sell marijuana to a minor			0
you must be over 21 to purchase the drug			0
those from instate can buy up to 1 oz in any form			2
anyone form out of state can buy half that quantity and must consume it before crossing state lines			0
retailers must be licensed and currently all such licenses have been issued to growers and retailers already providing medical marijuana which has been legally available in @entity12 for a decade			1
recreational marijuana will be taxed at 15 per cent excise and 10 per cent sales tax – higher than that sold to holders of a medical certificate , or ‘ red card			0
’ it is illegal to drive high			0
an initial legal limit of five nanograms of @entity171 per ml of blood was set but it has been suggested that this could be waived for drivers testing above this cutoff who show competence to drive			0
it is illegal to consume marijuana in public .			0
