he 's already spent £ 125,000 on his quest for the perfect face and body but despite having had liposuction , multiple nose jobs and a set of pec implants , @entity8 , 30 , is still not satisfied			1
now the @entity10 flight attendant has revealed that he is to have rhinoplasty for the fourth time - but will have to travel to the @entity12 to have the operation after being unable to find a surgeon closer to home			1
@entity8 , who describes his nose as ' totally botched ' , will travel to @entity17 for the surgery which will be performed by a doctor from @entity21 capital , @entity22			1
' it 's totally botched			2
' but , after failing to find a doctor in his usual surgery destinations @entity32 , @entity37 and @entity38 , he was pleased and surprised to find an alternative in @entity21			1
' i have found this amazing doctor based in @entity21 , ' he says excitedly			1
' apparently @entity21 is the country where people do the most nose jobs			1
' he guaranteed that he could give me my dream nose and said he can perform the surgery in @entity17 which is much better because , as you know , i do most of my shopping in @entity17			1
' @entity8 is no stranger to surgery and has already had 24 cosmetic operations at a total cost of £ 125,000			1
along with regular @entity52 injections , he has spent £ 30,000 on three nose jobs , £ 20,000 on a surgical six pack and £ 3,000 on having his calves reshaped			1
botched : @entity8 says his nose is ' botched ' after the three operations he has already had failed to deliver extensive : @entity8 , a flight attendant , has spent the last decade remodelling his body not happy : @entity8 , pictured before his transformation , says he felt unattractive and was left miserable he has also spent £ 8,000 on having self - designed pec implants put in place and another £ 9,000 on two rounds of liposuction			1
just before @entity64 , he splashed out another £ 5,000 on a hair transplant designed to fix his receding hairline			2
the latter , however , does n't really count according to @entity8 , who says looking like he does requires ' continuous maintenance '			1
' there was always going to be a need for continuous maintenance once i started on this journey , ' he explains			2
' there 's always going to be things that you need to get topped up and done			2
' work : @entity8 has become something of a champion for surgery and appears on @entity81 's @entity80 painful process : @entity8 says having so much surgery is all part of his journey and part of who he is expensive habit : on top of surgery costs , @entity8 spends £ 200 a month on lotions , gadgets and pills @entity95 ' quest for the perfect face and body began 10 years ago when he moved to @entity32 and felt himself to be unattractive in comparison with the people he met			1
' i was surrounded by beautiful and trendy people but i felt like i was n't welcome in their circles , ' he explains			2
' i am completely aware that i am far from perfection			0
i 'm not deluded and i know i 'm not the most good - looking guy			2
i 'm just aiming to be the best that i can possibly be			0
' luckily for @entity8 , a massive inheritance from his grandfather provided the funds to set about achieving his aim , beginning with a nose job			1
since then , the 30 - year - old has completely remodelled his body , although he admits that his bulging biceps and sculpted six - pack could have been created by exercising			1
' basically i do n't like going to the gym , ' he explains			0
' i just do n't like it			0
my time is valuable and i need it to catch up on my sleeping and do other things			0
' i do my muscle toning in my spare time when i 'm here in my bedroom lounging or watching a film			0
' @entity8 , who spends £ 200 a month on pills , gadgets and lotions , also owns a tooth whitening machine and happily admits that everything about him is artificial			1
' i 'm artificially made , ' he says cheerfully			0
' if you look at my chest it ’s all made of silicone			0
' not all of his procedures have gone to plan however , most notably a recent bid to have his biceps boosted , that left him in agony after he developed an infection			0
' i was lucky to be alive , ' he says			0
' i regretted [ that operation ] badly			2
i was crying all day			0
it was traumatic ... it was really was very bad			0
' nevertheless , with another operation planned , the experience does n't seem to have put him off cosmetic surgery			2
' i do n't think that i will really regret anything in the future , ' he says			0
' i really believe that everything i 've done to myself was an investment			0
' it is exhausting , it is expensive , it is time consuming but it is who i am and it is a long journey			0
once you start , stopping is very difficult			0
