why ca n't @entity0 and science exist concurrently ? and why should n't we remain relgious while embracing the ways technology is altering our life pattern ? these are some of the fundamentals behind the @entity7 , a new - age religion that has been developed to allow people to continue following their traditional denomination while endorsing the advancement of science and technology			1
according to a time magazine feature , @entity14 ’s followers are dedicated to studying and raising awareness about what they call ' personal cyberconciousness ' or the creation of mindfiles			1
however skeptics have been quick to call it ' the rapture of the nerds '			1
the @entity27 family that created and run the @entity7 keep a robot named @entity30 - named after mother and wife @entity27 - to see how precisely a robot in 2014 can function using the mindfiles system @entity14 subscribers believe that by ritualistically recording your thoughts and feelings , you can ultimately assemble a digital copy of yourself that would be available for future use			1
it starts with writing down or recording a video of a thought , memory or feeling and uploading it to a website , with more than 32,000 people so far creating free mindfile accounts			2
the mindfiles are stored on servers located in the two @entity14 headquarters in @entity53 and @entity54 , and by using @entity14 ’s services you accept their promise that they will protect those files for the long - term future , making it possible for some not - yet - invented software to organize those files and upload them into an artificial body 500 years from now			1
' a lot of people have problems digesting the idea , ' says @entity69 , a pastor at @entity70 and son of the creators , @entity73 and @entity14			0
' instead of saying '' mindfiling '' , i say ‘ ' digital scrapbooking ''			0
' @entity14 comes from the @entity78 word for ' @entity79 ' and is organized around four core tenets — life is purposeful , death is optional , @entity0 is technological and love is essential			1
a new religion has set out to store memories for centuries and deliver its believers into a world where our souls can outlive their human carriers			2
it is considered a ' transreligion ' , meaning followers do not have to give up being @entity94 , @entity95 or @entity96 , for example , to join			2
' @entity98 said science without religion is lame			2
religion without science is blind , ' @entity14 told @entity103			2
' @entity73 and i were inspired to find a way for people to believe in @entity0 consistent with science and technology so people would have faith in the future			1
' while @entity14 is not short of skeptics , religious pundits say the ideology is befitting of today 's world			1
more and more @entity116 are admitting to no longer being ' reglious ' , however maintaining they are ' spiritual '			0
additionally , companies like @entity118 and @entity119 are investing millions of dollars into technology that could potentially alter the end of life			1
@entity69 , a pastor at @entity14 and son of @entity73 and @entity14 , was working as the manager of a pizza restaurant until 2011 and is now running for @entity126 @entity127 , who helps run @entity14 , said its easy to write it off as a cult , but insists it is just a religion finding its start			0
' most people say , ' ‘ oh , it looks like a cult '' , ’ @entity127 says			0
' my older sister did			0
when she first looked at it , she told me , '' do n’t work for that organization			0
it looks like a cult and you ’ll be blacklisted in the legal community ''			0
' ' but any religion starts with just a few members			0
' and i guess organized religion is cultish			0
' some people call it the rapture of the nerds			1

the @entity7 is a new - age religion *designed* to allow @entity0 and technology *co-exist*
skeptics have called it ' the rapture of the nerds '
followers believe they can record a ' mindfile ' of themselves that will allow their soul to live on in the future , such as through a robot
religious pundits say the concept sits well next to @entity169 companies like @entity118 and @entity119 investing millions in technology that potentially alter life and death
