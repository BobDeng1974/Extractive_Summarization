@entity0 claims a change in medication has sharpened her memory by @entity5 last updated at 12:34 pm on 24th june 2011 @entity0 ’s own mother attempted to blow up prosecution evidence against her daughter today as she claimed that she was the one who looked up facts about chloroform on the family ’s home computer			1
in a stunning twist to the state ’s accusation that @entity18 researched the dangerous compound three months before using it to overpower her two - year - old daughter @entity0 , mrs @entity13 revealed that she had herself pulled up internet pages about chloroform in march 2008 , seeking health information relating to her pets			1
in testimony that prosecutors later challenged aggressively , mrs @entity13 said that her web searches – previously aired in court as part of the state ’s evidence that @entity18 planned her daughter ’s june 2008 murder – resulted from her initially looking up chlorophyll , the substance that gives plants their colour			2
@entity0 testified at daughter @entity18 's trial that she searched on the home computer for information about physical injuries and chloroform ' i was concerned about my smallest yorkie – we have two @entity45 puppies			1
the smallest one was having some issues where she was extremely tired all the time			2
both of the dogs would eat the bamboo leaves out the back so i started looking up sources from the back yard that could cause her to be more sleepy , and i started with ‘ chlorophyll ’ and that prompted me to look up ‘ chloroform ’ ' mrs @entity13 testified in court			2
@entity58 wears a necklace with a photo of her granddaughter caylee on it ' looking at chlorophyll , there ’s some bacteria associated with chloroform			2
it comes from different species of plants that have red and brown colour , and that prompted me to look up chloroform because some species naturally produce chloroform			2
' mrs @entity13 also told the court in @entity73 , @entity74 , that she had typed in search terms such as ‘ hydrogen peroxide ’ and ‘ alcohol ’ while seeking to find out more about a health scare over hand sanitizers and their possible dangers to children that had been brought to her attention by a colleague in march 2008			2
she had also inputted other search terms relating to bodily injuries because ' a good friend of mine was in a car accident and had multiple chest and head injuries , ' she said			2
in another revelation , mrs @entity13 said that a stain found in the boot of @entity18 ’s white @entity96 car – which the state has attempted to attribute to @entity0 ’s dead body having been stored in the vehicle before being dumped in a swamp – may have been present when she first bought the vehicle			1
mrs @entity13 ’s sudden claims rattled prosecutors who have for 26 days held the upper hand in the trial as @entity18 ’s defence team has faltered and made several damaging legal blunders			1
state attorney @entity108 appeared visibly angry and cynical as she tore into mrs @entity13 ’s evidence , clawing back some ground			0
she pointed out that mrs @entity13 ’s employment records showed her as having been at work at the times and dates that the home computer searches were made – which mrs @entity13 explained by saying that she went home early some days even though her records indicated otherwise - and asked her why she had only just brought up her claims three years on			1
@entity0 is standing trial in @entity74 for a first - degree murder charge , accused by prosecutors of killing her two - year - old daughter @entity0 in 2008 ' i did tell law enforcement			1
in fact , i told you during my deposition in 2009 that i made those searches , ' mrs @entity13 replied			0
' you told me that you searched ‘ chlorophyll ’ and you spelt chlorophyll for me , ' mrs @entity108 shot back , adding : ' did you type into the search bar of @entity132 ‘ how to make chloroform ’ ? ' – a reference to @entity136 evidence that someone typed in those specific words in march 2008			0
' i do n’t recall typing in ‘ how to make chloroform ’ , ' mrs @entity13 ceded , also accepting that she had not been responsible for other searches found by @entity136 computer analysts on the family ’s home computer , such as ‘ self defence , ’ ‘ how to make household weapons , ’ ‘ shovel ’ and ‘ neck breaking			0
’ if convicted of daughter @entity0 's murder , @entity18 could face the death penalty the @entity151 's home computer had been used to search for terms such as ' neck breaking ' , ' death ' and ' head injuries ' as well as ' chloroform ' , the prosecution told the jury two weeks ago ' i did n’t search for ‘ neck breaking ’ but i do recall that there was a pop - up that was showing a @entity161 ( video ) that was showing a skateboarder that was going on rails … i recall it saying ‘ a neck - breaking feat ’ ' mrs @entity13 said			1
the timing of the revelations – which scored significant points for the defence despite some of the later doubts raised by prosecutors - came at an ironic time in the trial of @entity0 , who potentially faces the death penalty if convicted of first - degree murder			1
she has pleaded not guilty , claiming that little @entity0 drowned accidentally in the family swimming pool			1
yesterday , a lawyer for @entity18 ’s parents told @entity181 that the couple believe their daughter is guilty			0
asked : ' do your clients @entity186 and @entity0 think that she is not guilty ' , the couple ’s lawyer @entity184 replied : ' they do n’t think that … they do not believe she is innocent			1
' @entity186 and @entity0 in the courtroom during the murder trial of their daughter @entity0 on tuesday he later backtracked , insisting that he was misunderstood			1
' i ’ve never said they thought she was guilty			0
i only said they have no idea what happened , ' mr @entity184 said			0
' they have no idea what the facts are			0
that ’s why they ’re sitting in the courtroom every single day			0
they hope they can get some semblance of truth			0
based on his story it sounds like i was saying my clients think she is guilty of murder			0
and any inference to that is wrong			0
' mr @entity184 added during a brief press conference outside court tonight : ' they ( the @entity223 ) do n't know whether or not she 's guilty of the crimes that have been alleged			0
... she 's still not guilty until the jury comes back and makes a determination of what happened			0
my clients want to know what happened			0
' addressing mrs @entity13 's sudden revelations about her computer searches three years on , mr @entity184 echoed his client 's statement in court that she was not the one who had looked up the phrases ' how to make chloroform ' or ' neck breaking ' on the home computer			0
but the matters she had recalled , such as her inter-connected searches on chlorophyll and chloroform , stemmed from the fact that her memory had improved since 2008 when @entity0 was found dead			1
' normally as time goes on our memory gets a little bit more cloudy , but she was taking medication because of the various issues and the stress she was suffering , ' he said			1
' her medication has since been changed by her doctor and it has clarified her memory from three years ago			1
