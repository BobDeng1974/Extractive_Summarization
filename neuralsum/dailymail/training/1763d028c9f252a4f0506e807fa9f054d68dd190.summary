the order never came after a terrorist wanted over the 1998 attack on the @entity20 in @entity21 was seized in the @entity23 capital @entity24			0
attack : a protester shouts outside the burning @entity3 consulate in @entity7 where four @entity3 were killed in september 2012 wanted : the @entity28 has released the images of three men caught on security cameras at the compound before the attack that it wants to question publicity surrounding the october 5 capture of @entity36 , a suspect in the 1998 terror attack , put the imminent @entity39 mission in jeopardy , according to some officials			1
it was feared that a second @entity3 raid in @entity23 could destabilize the country 's already fragile government			1
raid : terror suspect @entity36 was caught in an october 5 raid in @entity24 @entity11 is believed to be behind the armed assault on the @entity3 embassy that killed ambassador @entity50 and three other @entity3			1
president @entity51 said it was a ' priority ' to bring the @entity7 suspects ' to justice '			0
@entity11 is under federal indictment and the @entity28 is still investigating the attack			0
the agency has published photographs of people seen at the compound on the night of the raid , who it wants to question			0
