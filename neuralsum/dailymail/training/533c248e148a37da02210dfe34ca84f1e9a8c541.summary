as controversial weapons in the war on terror , they are regularly heard in the skies over countries such as @entity6 and @entity7			1
but drones are also a feature of the daily lives of a tiny community far removed from the world ’s most notorious troublespots			1
for the noise of the unmanned aircraft fills the air over @entity17 , a once - bustling fishing port nestling beneath cliffs in @entity19			1
@entity21 spy : a watchkeeper surveillance drone is put through its paces above @entity17 the seaside town is the unlikely home to what is billed as @entity28 ’s ‘ drone centre of excellence ’			1
the local airport , a former second world war raf station which is now privately owned , is the only place in the @entity28 where military and civilian unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity33 ) can be tested			0
it is surrounded by 500 square miles of restricted airspace , meaning the pilotless drones – used to carry out surveillance and deliver missile attacks without the need to put servicemen ’s lives in danger – can be flown without the risk of colliding with other aircraft			1
however , the decision to turn @entity46 into the @entity47 and spend £ 21million of taxpayers ’ money on a neighbouring technology park has shattered the peace of @entity52 in more ways than one			2
some critics have ethical concerns about using drones as remote battlefield weapons , saying that , particularly when used by @entity60 forces , they have been responsible for civilian deaths			2
unlikely droning test site : @entity52 in @entity19 was a quiet seaside village before the drones started flying overhead in @entity64 others say money has been wasted on a project which has yet to deliver the jobs that were promised			1
the @entity69 said @entity17 would create 1,000 jobs but the half - deserted site employs fewer than 40 people , while up to 12 more work at the airport			1
protesters also complain about noise , privacy and safety – two test drones have crashed			2
the state - of - the - art @entity80 , which cost £ 889million , is being put through its paces by the @entity83			0
fifty - four of the drones , which resemble giant grey cigars with wings , are destined for surveillance work in @entity6			2
the craft send images back to a control centre using cameras so sensitive they are capable of reading a playing card from 1,000ft			0
commanders say they allow @entity96 operations to be spotted , saving the lives of frontline troops			0
the @entity99 says @entity100 will not be armed , unlike the reaper drones operated by the @entity102 above @entity103 , but it is capable of pinpointing enemy targets for missile strikes			2
watchkeepers take off and land at @entity17 up to 25 times a day			1
the drones described by locals as ‘ flying lawnmowers ’ are audible even after they disappear from view			1
@entity114 , an opera singer who lives near the end of the runway , said : ‘ the noise of the drones is highly disturbing , sinister			1
it makes me think of those poor people who hear the whirring and they do n’t know if it ’s the last sound they hear before being blown to bits			0
’ war on terror : unmanned drones have become a controversial feature of modern warfare , commonly used in countries such as @entity6 and @entity128 for surveillance and missile attacks @entity131 , 68 , a retired stockbroker , said : ‘ they wanted a @entity135 - style hub for the @entity33 industry			1
they got a white elephant			0
it has been a scandalous waste of money			0
it would have been better if they ’d given 40 people half a million each to start a local business			0
’ @entity144 , @entity144 mp for @entity145 , said : ‘ there was always concern about the ethical dimension , the potential intrusion of surveillance , safety and the noise nuisance			0
but the community gave people the benefit of the doubt			0
‘ many promises were made and these have been in the pipeline for a very long time			0
despite a lot of public money being spent , there is not much evidence of economic development on the ground			0

controversial drones testing has been *ruining* the peace of a quiet seaside town in @entity19
locals find the drones ' sinister ' and ' highly disturbing '
@entity17 *residents* refer to them as the ' flying lawnmowers '
