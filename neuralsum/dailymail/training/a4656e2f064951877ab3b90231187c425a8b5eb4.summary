by @entity0 shameless : @entity2 was convicted in 2012 of murdering @entity2 @entity2 's shameless killer has bragged from behind bars that a public inquiry into the case will clear his name			1
@entity2 , 38 , is attempting to use an official review into undercover policing ordered by the home secretary following revelations that police spied on the family of @entity2 , to claim that he has been ' fitted up ' by corrupt detectives			1
in a series of bizarre rambling messages left on @entity21 , the murderer currently serving life for the stabbing of the black teenager , mused that the development could be ' life changing ' for him			1
the development comes as the detective suspected of acting corruptly during the initial botched murder inquiry emerged from his holiday hideaway yesterday for the first time since a damning report by barrister @entity30 , @entity31 , suggested that he helped shield @entity2 's killers			2
@entity30 's review contained shocking allegations of police corruption , cover - up and evidence that an undercover police officer spied on the grieving parents of the 18 - year - old aspiring architect , who was knifed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an racist attack in @entity45 , @entity46 , on april 22 , 1993			1
the report did not challenge any of the forensic evidence which led to the conviction of @entity2 's killers			2
although it raised the prospect that undercover police operations may have led to wrongful convictions in other cases			0
but less than 24 hours after its publication , @entity2 instructed his sister @entity57 to post this message : ' a message from @entity2			2
' @entity61 everyone , finally the met police look like they are being held responsible for the monumental wrong doing they have orchestrated in this case over the last 21 years			2
stabbed to death : @entity2 was killed by a gang of white youths at a south - east @entity46 bus stop in 1993 ' the " evidence " i am sitting in prison for was corrupted and i now hope someone will be held accountable for this			1
' the failings in this investigation fall in all directions , not all in my favour , whenever the surface of this case is scratched more revelations are revealed that bring the whole establishment into question			0
' no wonder they fitted us up to take the edge , or focus , off of this travesty they have done to many family 's ( sic )			0
just how deep does it go ? ? ' in the mean time i am incarcerated for a terrible crime i played no part in , and my children grow up without their @entity96			0
' i look forward to this inquiry with life changing interest , and thank all you people for your relentless support , defeat is only bitter if swallowed ! ' all my love @entity104 ' jailed : @entity2 was also convicted of murdering @entity2 yesterday it emerged that @entity2 , who was convicted in 2012 of @entity2 's murder , along with @entity2 , 37 , has been posting regular messages on @entity21 despite strict rules banning prisoners from going online			1
he manages to get his misspelt missives out through his sister @entity57 who posts them on the justice for @entity2 page , which has 858 members			1
in another rant the same day , he wrote : ' a lot of people out there ie. the police , media , government and any other secret service involved in this case need to be brought to book , heads need to roll			2
' stop the cover up			0
' @entity2 's shameless bid to use the public inquiry to his own end is a bitter blow to @entity2 's mother , @entity132 who took great comfort in the fact that @entity2 had finally admitted his guilt when he dropped an appeal against his conviction exactly a year ago			2
then @entity139 said : ' it took me and my family almost 20 years to get justice for my son @entity2 when @entity2 and @entity2 were convicted of the murder in january 2012			1
' in those years i had put my grieving on hold and had to struggle against police racism			0
it would have been a great comfort to me and my family if @entity2 or his accomplices had admitted what they had done			2
' now that @entity2 has dropped his appeal i can only assume it is because he has finally admitted he murdered @entity2			0
' intervention : in 1997 the @entity156 used its front page to name @entity2 , @entity2 and three others of killing @entity2 but far from accepting guilt , @entity2 's family and friends are now attempting to use the @entity30 review to mobilise a demonstration to get the killer out of jail			1
his mother @entity166 wrote : ' @entity167 ...			0
' the @entity30 review published earlier this month looked at whether the hunt for @entity2 's killers was damaged by corruption			1
the @entity31 said there was a high level of suspicion that detective sergeant @entity174 , who worked on the original murder inquiry , was corrupt and had links to @entity2 ' gangster father @entity177			1
the former detective , who has run a restaurant in the @entity181 holiday island of @entity182 for 15 years since taking early retirement from the @entity184 , has been in hiding since the review			0
but yesterday he emerged from his home sporting a deep tan as he indulged in some @entity188 has announced a probe into whether mr @entity174 was in the pay of drug smuggler @entity191			0
he could be questioned on suspicion of misconduct in a public office or perverting the cause of justice - both of which carry heavy jail terms			0
but the @entity199 - born 68 - year - old , who was nicknamed @entity201 for ' @entity202 ' during his time on the @entity184 , has denied any wrongdoing , telling fellow expats : ' they 'll never lay a finger on me			0
i 've done nothing wrong			0
' they 've got nothing to do me for			0
