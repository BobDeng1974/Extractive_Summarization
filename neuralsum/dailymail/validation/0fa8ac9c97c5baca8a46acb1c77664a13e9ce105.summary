@entity0 has agreed to make an emotional return to @entity2 after answering the call to salvage their promotion campaign			1
the @entity7 legend will take over as manager until the end of the season in a bid to steer the @entity13 club back to the top flight via the @entity16 play - offs			1
caretaker boss @entity17 , who handed in his notice in january , is not expected to play any role in the new first - team coaching set - up			1
@entity0 is a former manager of @entity21 and played for @entity2 for seven years that could open the way for @entity0 to bring in @entity24 , his assistant during a successful stint in charge at @entity21			1
@entity17 admitted after tuesday ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity28 that there was now a danger of @entity2 missing out on the play - offs altogether if they did n’t find form			1
they have won just one of their last seven matches , dropping to third place in the table behind @entity39			0
that dismal sequence convinced @entity41 and the new @entity13 board that they had to act , with @entity0 approached to see if he would be willing to agree a short - term contract			1
an extended deal contingent upon winning promotion could also be a possibility following a day of discussions			0
no official confirmation on @entity0 ’s appointment was forthcoming from @entity2 on wednesday night but that is expected to follow on thursday			1
@entity0 achieved back - back top - flight finishes during his time at @entity54 it is also understood the players were told to report back to @entity57 early on friday morning – after a day off – in preparation for meeting their new boss			1
@entity0 , who won six league titles in seven years as a @entity2 midfielder , has been out of work since resigning at @entity54 last november after a slump in form			1
however , his overall record in @entity66 was hugely impressive , including back - to - back second - place finishes and a @entity69 final			2
the 50 - year - old is also currently a member of @entity73 ’s @entity72 backroom staff but admitted last month it may be an ‘ impossibility ’ to combine that role with managing a club of @entity2 ’ size			2
@entity41 flew back to @entity78 via @entity79 on wednesday , admitting in an interview en route that ‘ the playing side is in need of a huge injection of energy ’			0
he also added that the new regime would do ‘ whatever it takes to give the club the best chance of promotion this season ’			0
@entity0 is the man they have turned to for that purpose , with saturday ’s home game against @entity95 set to open his tenure			2
@entity73 has also used @entity0 as part of his coaching set - up with the @entity72 national team @entity41 seized control of @entity2 after a landslide victory at the club 's most recent @entity102 speaking last week , @entity2 midfielder and @entity106 player @entity104 welcomed the prospect of a @entity0 appointment			1
‘ for me personally , it would be great , ’ said @entity104			0
‘ not just for me , but for the club as well			0
‘ he ’s a legend here and he knows about the club and the expectations			0
there would be no trouble with him there			0
' with his character , it ’ s something he would relish			0
it would n’t worry him at all			0
i ’m sure he ’d get a positive reaction straight away just with his demeanour and the way he is			0
if he ’s lucky enough to get it i ’m sure he ’ll do a great job			0
’ meanwhile , @entity128 has agreed to step down from his position as football board chairman and will make an ‘ amicable ’ exit from @entity2			1
the @entity13 club announced on tuesday that @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 had been suspended from their duties ‘ pending investigation ’			2
