we 've divided the @entity1 into teams from the north and south of @entity5 - with @entity7 side @entity6 included in the south			1
@entity9 had the choice to pick any players from the south teams , in any formation , with no limit on the number of players from each club			0
here 's how we split the clubs : @entity19 @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity6 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 @entity30 @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 @entity30			1
it is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of @entity5			0
but without dipping into the political allegiances , property prices and weather , we 're sticking to the ultimate debating point – football			0
this week we are starting a new @entity19 debate - who would you pick and who would win ? in the @entity55 , each season they stage an all - star match that pits the best from the @entity58 against the cream of the @entity60			2
and would n't it be fascinating if the @entity1 adopted a similar event ? kicking off today , @entity9 selects his @entity64 - plus seven subs			1
a full explanation of the criteria is below			0
tomorrow , @entity68 will reveal his @entity69 then on wednesday , we 'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at @entity73			1
and , as always , we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team ... @entity22 are top of the @entity1 , and they provide the back - bone of our south xi to face the north goalkeeper : @entity81 ( @entity22 ) not much to say – either him or @entity82 as goalkeeper of the season , so he ’s a natural for the southern no 1 slot			1
right back : @entity87 ( @entity26 ) you can wrestle this one back and forth with @entity88 who has been superb			1
but i want a little more pace from my full backs and also am looking to the future by giving @entity87 the nod			0
centre back : @entity95 ( @entity26 ) everyone thought @entity96 was the mainstay of the @entity26 defence – but quietly getting on with his job and holding together the best back four in the country has been @entity95			1
@entity81 has proven himself to be a genuine @entity1 star in his first season in @entity5 @entity87 ( left ) has earned himself an @entity5 spot , and keeps @entity88 out of our side despite losing his centre back partner last summer , @entity95 has marshalled the best defence in the league centre back : @entity108 ( captain ) ( @entity22 ) would be ridiculous not to pick him – the best defender in the @entity1 at present			1
left back : @entity111 ( @entity22 ) @entity112			2
best left back in the @entity1			2
defensive midfield : @entity115 ( @entity22 ) for months he has been the pivotal player for @entity22 in providing balance – in the mould of @entity119 and there is no higher praise			2
defensive midfield : @entity126 ( @entity26 ) the steadying influence in @entity26 ’s rise , all the more remarkable given his disaffection at the start of the season			2
@entity108 - still the best defender in the @entity1 - will captain our south @entity64 , as he does @entity22 @entity126 has bounced back from his uncertain summer to be a mainstay for @entity26 @entity115 , @entity133 and @entity108 have been at the heart of @entity22 's table - topping form this season right wing : @entity137 ( @entity20 ) better on the left but nevertheless we need to find room for him in this team			1
the @entity144 axis would terrify any team			0
attacking midfield : @entity147 ( @entity20 ) appears to be at the absolute peak of his career			2
previously you wondered if he had the authority and character to dominate games - now , in his favoured central role , he is showing that			0
left wing : @entity133 ( @entity22 ) potential player of the year			1
impish , quick and delightfully skilful			0
a pleasure to watch – and a much more mature player now after two years in the @entity1			2
@entity137 has been superb since signing for @entity20 , and is on the right wing for this side @entity133 's goals have helped take @entity22 top of the league , and he is a player of the season contender @entity147 has shown his best form since returning to a central role , and will operate behind the striker striker : @entity170 ( @entity27 ) the easiest pick of all			1
the south is blessed with the best strikers , so much so that maybe we ’ll go 4 - 4 - 2 later in the game to get @entity177 or @entity178 on			1
but there ’s no doubt as to who is in best form at present			0
subs @entity184 ( @entity25 ) @entity185 is probably the next best goalkeeper in the south ; but we need a keeper who is sharp and playing regularly and @entity184 has been superb			0
@entity170 has emerged this season as one of the @entity1 's leading strikers , and is a must - pick @entity88 is unlucky to miss out on a starting spot , but stays on the bench for our south xi @entity88 ( @entity22 ) very hard to leave him out			1
he has been a monster this season , rarely dipping below a 7/10 performance			0
@entity199 ( @entity20 ) i ’m a little worried that pace may be an issue for my centre halves – if it is we have @entity199 to cover			0
excellent defender as well , despite @entity20 ’s frequent debacles			0
@entity207 ( @entity21 ) no doubt he will be outraged at being in a southern team – but we had to draw the line somewhere			0
just a really good , solid midfielder now			0
@entity212 ( @entity23 ) has come on enormously this season and the @entity215 break does n't appear to have affected him at all – causes problems to every team he plays against			0
@entity178 ( @entity20 ) unfashionably good			2
his strike rate has been superb and his physicality and ability to hold the ball up is now perhaps the best in the @entity1 , alongside ... ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity81 , @entity87 , @entity95 , @entity108 , @entity111 ; @entity115 , @entity126 ; @entity137 , @entity147 , @entity133 ; @entity170			1
subs : @entity184 , @entity88 , @entity199 , @entity207 , @entity212 , @entity177 , @entity178 @entity177 ( @entity22 ) the season has ebbed and flowed at times but through it all he has remained the striker you want to have on your side			1
edged out by @entity170 at present but he ’ll play a part in this game			2
@entity231 mentions to @entity232 ( @entity6 ) and @entity233 ( @entity25 ) who have both been excellent and who will be on the stand - by list			0
@entity207 - though not particularly southern - has done enough this season to earn a spot on the bench @entity23 winger @entity212 has caused problems for every defender he has faced this season @entity178 , underrated but efficient , celebrates yet another @entity1 goal for @entity20			1

no place for @entity177 or @entity178 as @entity170 leads the line
@entity26 and @entity22 - the @entity1 's *meanest* defences - make up the entire back seven of our @entity248
@entity133 and @entity137 will play with @entity147 behind @entity170
we 'll test who is better with help from @entity73
