two children swapped at birth in a @entity4 hospital blunder can not be returned to their natural parents because they are too attached to their ‘ adopted ' mothers , a report has found			1
the biological mothers of the four - year - old children learnt last year that their babies had been swapped at the @entity10 in @entity11 in 2010			1
it only became clear an error had been made when one of the mothers , from @entity15 in @entity4 , attempted to claim maintenance payments from the man she thought was her child ’s father			0
two children swapped at birth in a @entity4 hospital blunder can not be returned to their natural parents because they are too attached to their ‘ adopted ' mothers , a report has found ( file picture ) but according to sowetanlive.co.za , paternity tests then revealed that he was not the father – and she was not the mother			1
a legal expert has now recommended that the boy and girl should stay with the parents who have raised them since they were born , the website says			1
a report , drawn up by the @entity37 's @entity39 director @entity38 , has now been handed to a court for consideration			0
if accepted it would see the mothers cutting legal ties with their biological children – although they would have contact with them			1
but they would then be treated as adoptive parents of the children they have been raising , sowetanlive.co.za reports			1
@entity50 said the swap is likely to have happened after the midwife overseeing the births mixed up the files or the name tags of the babies on a ‘ very busy ’ day			1
she said that it was the first case she had heard of in @entity4 where babies of different genders had been swapped adding that the families have a damages claim			2
one of the mothers had wanted her biological child back when she first found out about the blunder , but later acknowledged that it may not be in the youngster ’s best interests , the report said			2
the other woman was left needing hospital treatment for shock at learning the daughter she had been raising was not hers			0
@entity50 wrote that the second woman ’s former boyfriend had been left ‘ devastated ’ by the news			0
‘ he said that the shock of the news … had left him devastated			0
he compared it to the loss of all his limbs , ’ she wrote			0
she added : ‘ the parents have suffered enormously and continue to be under considerable stress			2
the children are not yet aware of the problem , but the latest assessments indicate they are picking up on their mothers ’ anxieties			2
‘ although financial assistance will not solve all the problems , it will ease their current difficulties			0
’ psychologists and medical experts are helping the families , who have ‘ very strong ’ bonds with the children they have been caring for from birth			1
the parents are to be offered the opportunity to respond to the recommendations and those involved are due to agree on a court date to consider @entity50 ’s findings .			0
