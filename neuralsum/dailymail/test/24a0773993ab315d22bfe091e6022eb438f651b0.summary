it is the radio format that has delivered the latest chart hits , news and talk shows in stereo to homes around the world for decades			2
but now the characteristic hiss of interference that accompanies most @entity10 broadcasts is set to fall silent			2
@entity11 has announced that it will be the the first country in the world to switch off its fm radio signal			1
twiddling the knobs of a radio will no longer be necessary as analogue services switch off in favour of digital the @entity11 government said it will turn off its fm transmitters on january 11 2017			1
now with the ever expanding number of digital radio services and growing numbers of people choosing to listen to internet radio , it seems likely other countries will follow @entity11 's example			1
the @entity29 had planned to switch off its own @entity10 service by 2018 but the plans were later shelved following objections from commercial radio stations			1
it is now not expected to happen until sometime after 2020 when digital listeners are expected to outstrip those using analogue stations			2
streaming has topped cd sales in revenue for the first time in the @entity43 as music listeners flock to on - demand services and internet radio , industry figures showed			1
data for 2014 showed a major shift to streaming as opposed to physical sales and permanent downloads , with rapid growth both for on - demand services such as @entity54 and @entity55 and internet radio providers such as @entity57			1
streaming revenue totaled $ 1.87 billion , edging out the $ 1.85 billion earned by cd sales , according to data of the @entity61			0
streaming helped stabilize the bottom line for the long - troubled industry , with overall revenue from recorded music going up two percent to $ 4.86 billion to mark the fourth year of growth			0
listening figures currently show that digital radios account for 37.9 % of all listening hours in the @entity29			0
in the @entity43 , around 85 % of @entity43 adults still listen to am / @entity10 stations			0
@entity11 , however , has just five national @entity10 broadcasting outlets while there are 22 national digital radio stations			1
the @entity11 government said there was space for a further 20 digital radio stations and @entity78 , @entity11 's public service broadcaster , will be the first to switch off its fm service			1
the @entity11 @entity81 estimates that the switch to digital radio could save £ 17 million a year ( nok 200 million )			1
@entity84 , the country 's minister of culture , said : ' radio digitisation will open the door to a far greater range of radio channels , benefiting listeners across the country			0
' listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio content , and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality			0
' @entity96 will also greatly improve the emergency preparedness system , facilitate increased competition and offer new opportunities for innovation and development			0
digital radios , like above , might look retro but can give listeners access to more stations than ever before growing numbers of car stereos now come with digital radio as standard , leading to a drop in @entity10 listeners ' more than half the population already has access to local radio on @entity113 , and there is considerable potential for further local channels			1
' the switch off of @entity10 services could create other problems - leaving millions of households with legacy electronics unable to pick up a signal			2
@entity10 , which was first invented in 1933 , transmits information by modulating the frequency of the carrier wave			0
this produces a high quality analogue signal that travels over short distances but can be prone to interference			0
@entity10 became the popular way to transmit stereo broadcasts and it also became hugely popular with pirate radio stations			2
digital radio by comparison uses digital modulation - compressing the audio signal into a specific bandwidth spectrum			0
this allows more radio stations to be crammed into the bandwidth space and can produce clearer reception .			0

@entity11 will be the first country in the world to stop radio broadcasts on fm
it says it will save £ 17 million a year by the switch to a *purely* digital service
the *decision* was driven by rise in popularity of digital and internet radio
other countries are expected to follow as numbers of @entity10 listener drop
