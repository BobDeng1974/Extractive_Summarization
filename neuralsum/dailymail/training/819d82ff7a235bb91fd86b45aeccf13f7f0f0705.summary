by @entity0 published : 23:39 est , 4 august 2012 updated : 23:39 est , 4 august 2012 winning an olympic gold medal is surely one of the happiest moments in any athlete 's career			1
but when members of @entity8 return home from their triumphs in @entity11 , they could face an unwelcome surprise - a large tax bill on the value of their winnings			0
now members of @entity17 from both sides of the aisle have launched a bid to exempt the nation 's medallists from having to hand over some of the spoils of their success to the government			0
champion : but @entity28 could have to pay $ 9,000 for each gold medal as well as the precious metals which @entity33 medals are composed with , each victor receives a cash prize for his or her performance			1
gold medallists are awarded $ 25,000 by the @entity38 , while silver winners receive $ 15,000 and bronze $ 10,000			2
this means that athletes could be liable for up to $ 9,000 in income tax for each gold medal they win			1
they could also theoretically pay $ 200 for the value of the metal in the medal itself - though it is unlikely that the @entity48 would make that demand			2
liable : 16 - year - old gymnastics prodigy @entity50 could also face taxes several congressmen have now launched attempts to prevent @entity33 athletes paying any tax at all on their @entity33 - related earnings			2
one of the first proposed bills came from @entity59 senator @entity58 , a @entity60 rising star , who argued : ' our tax code is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success , and the tax imposed on @entity33 medal winners is a classic example of this madness			1
' athletes representing our nation overseas in the @entity33 should n't have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home			2
' mr @entity58 's measure would exempt ' the value of any prize or award won by the taxpayer in athletic competition in the @entity33 ' from income tax calculations			1
law change : @entity60 congressmen @entity58 , left , and @entity83 , right , are among the legislators seeking to exempt @entity85 from income tax on friday @entity83 , the @entity60 chairman of the @entity87 , announced that he too would back efforts to allow the athletes to keep their earnings			1
' these athletes deserve every bit of our support and appreciation for representing the @entity98 on the world stage , ' the @entity92 congressman said			0
' allowing our olympians to receive and enjoy their medals and awards without having to worry about whether they can pay the taxes on their accomplishment is just one small way we can show that support			0
' other members of the @entity87 seeking to eliminate tax on @entity33 earnings include republicans @entity111 and @entity112 , and @entity114 @entity113			1
no thanks : beach volleyball star @entity116 says the gesture is unnecessary many @entity8 champions will doubtless be grateful for @entity17 ' attempts to give them a financial helping hand			0
but one athlete , beach volleyball star @entity116 , has rejected the offer , saying he thinks well - off sportsmen should have to pay their fare share			0
' for me , i make enough that i would say i should get taxed , ' said mr @entity116 , a gold medallist in 2008			0
' i 'm not going to say i would n't take it , but i 'm just looking at it from a realistic perspective			0

gold medal winners could have to pay $ 9,000 tax
