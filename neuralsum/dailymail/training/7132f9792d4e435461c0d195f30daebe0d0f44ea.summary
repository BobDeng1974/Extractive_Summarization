@entity0 is not worried about @entity3 's @entity2 preparations despite a heavy 3 - 0 defeat to @entity5 in the @entity7 curtain raiser			1
the @entity2 champions looked second - best at @entity9 with less than a week to go until they open the defence of their title against @entity12			1
but their @entity14 coach is still confident he can get his side up to scratch by the time they visit @entity19 - and he also believes he could have a deal for @entity21 wrapped up by then to boost @entity3 's threadbare defence			1
' we played with a lack of pace that ’s not usual in our team			0
i do n’t know what happened			0
' in the second half we improved - we had the chances but @entity5 scored with their only shot in the half			2
we have to talk about it and try to arrange it			0
' but @entity0 is not bothered by the pace problems of his side - or anything else , seemingly , as he looks to make @entity3 only the third club to successfully defend the @entity2 title			1
get it sorted : the deal for @entity21 is now just down to some missing papers , @entity0 says @entity55 seen in @entity3 ' i ’m not so worried about the pace			1
we had important players missing today			0
i ’m sure we ’ll be ready to start the @entity2 on sunday			1
' in the @entity2 you have five or six teams who can win			2
in this moment we must demonstrate why we won the title this year			0
we have a lot of chances because we have a strong squad			0
' when asked about whether a deal for @entity21 would get over the line the @entity3 boss said : ' i hope			2
' i think some papers are missing but we continue having an interest in the player and the player wants to come so we ’ll see what will happen during the week			0
' painful sight : @entity3 's players , led by @entity77 , could only watch on as @entity5 lifted the @entity7			2

@entity3 looked poor in 3 - 0 defeat to @entity5 at @entity9
but @entity0 says the champions will be ready in time for @entity2
they face @entity12 at @entity19 in their *season* opener on sunday
@entity14 coach is hoping to get @entity89 defender deal over the line soon
he says ' some papers are missing ' but the *transfer* seems to be *imminent*
