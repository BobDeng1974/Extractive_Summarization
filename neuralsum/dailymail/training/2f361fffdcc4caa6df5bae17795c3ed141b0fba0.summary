by @entity0 tanning lotions and fake tans are considered a safer alternative to sitting out in the sun for hours - but how exactly do they work ? according to chemistry teacher @entity9 , the reaction they create with our skin is the same reaction that occurs when browning meat in a hot pan			1
mr @entity9 has created an infographic to explain how chemicals in the lotion react to skin cells , and why this causes the skin to turn brown			2
an infographic ( pictured ) created by chemistry teacher @entity9 shows that tanning lotions contain dihydroxyacetone , commonly abbreviated to @entity21 , and erythrulose			1
tanning lotions contain up to 15 % @entity21 , but many sit within the three to five per cent range			0
the higher the percentage , the darker the tan ‘ we ’re all well versed in the dangers of spending too much time in the sun , ' said mr @entity9 on his blog @entity31			2
tanning lotions take around two to four hours to take effect , and will continue for up to 72 hours @entity21 reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce chemicals called melanoidins			1
this is known as a @entity40 reaction , which is also the name given to the reaction that causes meat to brown when cooked			1
these melanoidins absorb certain wavelengths of light , and this results in them appearing brown on the skin			1
this reaction takes around two to four hours to take effect , and will continued for up to 72 hours			0
as the dead skin cells are shed , these colour fades and this cycles takes around 10 days			2
‘ however , if you ’re unlucky enough not to have the time for a couple of weeks on the beach , you might be tempted to resort to tanning lotions to achieve a tanned look			0
’ ‘ these can induce the appearance of a tan , through the action of the chemicals they contain			0
’ mr @entity9 continued that the main chemicals used in tanning lotions are dihydroxyacetone , commonly abbreviated to @entity21 , and erythrulose			2
@entity21 can be used on its own , and while erythrulose produces a more gradual effect , and is often used with @entity21 , it is rarely used on its own			0
tanning lotions contain up to 15 per cent @entity21 , but many sit within the three to five per cent range			0
the higher the percentage , the darker the tan			0
@entity21 reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce chemicals called melanoidins			1
this is known as a @entity40 reaction , and is also the name given to the reaction that causes meat to brown when cooked			1
these melanoidins absorb certain wavelengths of light , and this results in them appearing brown on the skin			1
@entity9 continued that studies have previously found the amount of uv - induced free radicals - oxygen molecules said to have a hand in everything from ageing to diabetes and cancer - produced 24 hours after lotion was applied is 180 per cent higher than untreated skin			0
@entity21 reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce chemicals called melanoidins			1
this is known as a @entity40 reaction , which is also the name given to the reaction that causes meat to brown when cooked			1
these melanoidins absorb certain wavelengths of light , and this results in them appearing brown on the skin put more simply , this means the skin is more sensitive to @entity115 rays a day after application and should be protected			2
other studies have found that @entity21 from tanning lotions is absorbed by living skin tissue – as much as 11 per cent , but it ’s unclear if this has any effect on the body			2
elsewhere , normal tanning is created by melanin produced in the skin			0
when people use fake tan , they may believe they have developed natural protection from the sun ’s rays , added mr @entity9 , meaning that many do n’t use extra protection , and put themselves at risk			0
he continued that tanning lotions have an @entity137 rating of three , on average .			0

@entity9 has explained the reaction on his @entity31 blog
the chemistry teacher explained lotions contain dihydroxyacetone ( @entity21 )
@entity21 reacts with amino acids in dead skin cells to produce melanoidins
these absorb certain wavelengths of light that make the skin look brown
this is known as a @entity40 reaction , which is also the name given to the reaction that causes meat to brown when cooked
