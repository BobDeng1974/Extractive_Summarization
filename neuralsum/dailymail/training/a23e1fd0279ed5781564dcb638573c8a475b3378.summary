there is just one job requirement on @entity3 ’s cv and the striker duly delivered it , marking his first start for @entity7 with his first goal			1
a bog - standard header , presented to him a yard or so out , provided the @entity13 club with the platform to ease into the fifth round of the @entity16			2
homegrown @entity21 , he of the straw - coloured hair and @entity20 disposition capitalised on a rare @entity24 mistake to double the lead near the end			1

@entity84 @entity24 were given the respect they deserved with @entity77 selecting a strong side , including @entity3 and @entity87 defender @entity37			1
@entity7 also trialled a new formation , going for the suddenly back - in - fashion three central defenders against @entity24 ’s four - four - two			1
yet it was the lower league side who started the brighter as striker @entity65 twice found himself in what could be described as shooting positions			0
unfortunately for the forward both efforts were blocked and , as a consequence , @entity7 woke up			2
the breakthrough came from @entity43 ’s corner , which was headed into the turf by @entity99 , bounced up and there was master predator @entity3 from close range			2

two seasons ago he was wearing a @entity75 shirt as he scored against @entity116 and @entity117 in the same competition			2
whether the wanderer has found his spiritual home at the @entity121 is too soon to say but he is guaranteed lots of chances from @entity7 ’s open style of play			2
a few were created against @entity24 , who were playing their sixth @entity16 tie thanks to a replay with @entity130 after fielding an ineligible player and a bona fide replay for drawing with @entity133			0
throw @entity134 into the mix and @entity137 ’s team had earned the right for a day in the limelight			0
six thousand fans made the short trip for a @entity143 derby and a rare @entity16 meeting between the two sides			0
this was the third time they have met in this competition			0
historical note : in 1948 @entity7 won by this scoreline and in 1907 the first match was 1 - 1 with @entity7 winning the replay 4 - 0			2
more usual these days is a fixture for the @entity156			0
@entity24 wanted to make the most of their first fourth round tie since the famous run of 1997 when they went all the way to the semi-finals			0
in the end , though , they could not make the most of their rare chances			0
@entity58 and @entity60 might look back with a tinge of regret after snatching at shots			0
@entity24 fans enjoyed the trip to play @entity13 side @entity7 , despite going down 2 - 0 the supporters of the @entity84 side were in fine voice throughout the game @entity40 ( left ) battles with @entity56 ( right ) of @entity24 to win a header @entity24 manager @entity137 shouts instructions to his players in the match against @entity7 @entity24 goalkeeper @entity53 , on the other hand , played commendably well making saves from @entity3 and @entity38			1
the game looked to be settled at one goal when @entity21 robbed @entity63 and steered the ball past @entity53			1
@entity63 had been the scoring hero in the previous round but that ’s the problem with @entity16 dreams			0
they tend not to last that long .			0

@entity3 fired @entity7 into the lead with a 20th minute header
the @entity75 loanee was denied a second with only @entity53 to beat
will @entity21 added to the goal from @entity3 on 82 to secure the win
