@entity1 head coach @entity0 is unsure whether a planned boycott by @entity4 fans will prove a help or hindrance to his side this weekend			1
this season , like so many in recent years , has been a frustrating one at @entity8 and that has led some fans to take action when @entity1 arrive on sunday			1
a number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner @entity16 , which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 ( right ) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to @entity4 @entity4 fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at @entity8 it will certainly make it an interesting test for @entity0 's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own			1
' you never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive , ' the @entity1 boss said			1
' maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season			2
' or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and do n't show their face			2
' you never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team			2
for that it is difficult to guess what will happen on sunday			2
' on paper , this looks a good opportunity for @entity1 to make amends for the goalless draw at @entity50 and home defeat to @entity52			1
@entity53 scored the winner for @entity52 to leave @entity1 ' season in danger of fizzling out the fact @entity0 's predecessor @entity58 oversaw the latter 's victory made it all the more frustrating , yet the @entity1 boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to @entity8			1
