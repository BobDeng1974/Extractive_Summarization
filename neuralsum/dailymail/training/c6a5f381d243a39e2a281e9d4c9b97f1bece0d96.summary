troubled : the @entity19 pictured in @entity20 , @entity21 on february 18 - days before it was inspected among the many complaints from @entity10 inspectors was that there was not enough chlorine in swimming pools and there were no ' sneeze shields ' in front of salad bars			1

a @entity19 spokesman told @entity41 that the company was taking aggressive action over the failings and had requested a re-inspection as soon as possible			0
fascination failed its inspection in the same month that another @entity19 boat , the @entity49 , became stranded in the @entity50 for five days without working toilets , power or air conditioning			1
@entity54 : the pool area on the @entity19 had not enough chlorination , the @entity10 found during a recent @entity58 public health inspection held in february , @entity19 received a score of 84 out of 100 points , with 86 meeting @entity62 standards			1
