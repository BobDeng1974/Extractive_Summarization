when @entity1 lets his hair down after a hard day conquering the pop world , he likes to have a few beers with old mates at his newly restored @entity8 farmhouse			1
but woe betide any friend who places his bottle down on a table , for the 23 - year - old singer - songwriter will be sure to place a coaster quickly underneath to prevent it marking the surface			2
‘ i love cleaning , that ’s my thing			2
i really like making the house perfect , ’ says @entity1 , who claims he ’s so house - proud that he frets if more than five people visit at once			1
rock ’ n ’ roll ? more like @entity35			2
the spotlight swung once more on to the refreshingly unstarry but acutely business - savvy @entity1 this week as it emerged that he was 2014 ’s biggest - selling pop artist with his second album , @entity38 ( pronounced multiply )			1
in @entity41 alone , it sold 1.7 million copies and , around the world , it has been played 430 million times on the online music provider @entity46			1
he has been hailed as @entity41 ’s biggest cultural export since @entity49 ’s @entity48 and in some ways he is just as reassuringly cosy as the costume drama			1
here is a regular nice guy whose scruffy image , understated manner and proud housekeeping skills could n’t be further from the showbusiness cliches			2
his songs are simple , almost uniquely combining folk and rap			2
he fills stadiums and yet performs unaccompanied with his acoustic guitar			0
thatcherite background ? @entity1 grew up in a middle - class family in @entity8 we do n’t yet know his political views — he ’s far too self - effacing to foist those on us			1
but at the risk of ruining his credibility , it has to be said that , in many ways , @entity1 is the perfect @entity72 pop star			1
the product of a supportive , middle - class @entity75 family , he has pulled himself up through talent and sheer bloody - minded hard work			1
you could hardly accuse @entity1 of riding the usual image - obsessed route to pop stardom			1
he ’s sweet - looking rather than handsome — he boasts an unruly mop of ginger hair , an unconvincing beard and a student wardrobe			2
on stage without his guitar , he looks like a fan who ’s just jumped up there			2
but this ordinariness , say music industry insiders , is the secret to his success			2
young fans can relate to @entity1 in a way they can not to other , far more glamorous , stars			1
similarly , his songs touch on everyday themes such as the torment of young lovers who must part when they go to different universities			0
it ’s not surprising he writes about ordinary , middle - class life , as that is exactly where @entity1 comes from			1
he grew up in the @entity8 market town of @entity108			0
his father is an art historian and his mother a jewellery maker			0
both ardent music lovers , they introduced him to classic sixties and @entity116 artists			0
the young @entity1 says he was inspired to take up the guitar after seeing @entity118 in concert			1
unfocused at school , he was 14 when he released his first recording			0
at 17 , he persuaded his parents to let him leave school and move to @entity28 to follow his passion			0
his father , @entity125 , supportively cut out newspaper interviews with singer - songwriters , highlighting quotes he thought would help his son fulfil his dream			0
‘ i did n’t have a @entity133 was it , ’ @entity1 said in an interview just before @entity132			1
‘ my dad said : “ if you really want to do it , do n’t have a fall - back plan			0
because you eventually will do it if there ’s no other option			2
” ’ sound advice , but life certainly was n’t easy in those early years			0
in his first year in @entity28 in 2008 , his rent was covered by a £ 400 - a - month grant while he took a music course			0
when the money ran out , he would doss down on sofas and even spent a couple of nights under an arch outside @entity150			0
he would play wherever and whenever he could , busking around the @entity151 and accepting payment for gigs in pubs in the form of food and beer			0
the following year , 2009 , he played an astonishing 312 gigs			0
why ? because he discovered that @entity159 , a similar @entity41 song - writer who suddenly shot to fame a few years ago , succeeded after performing 200 concerts a year — and he wanted to do half as many again			1
but by 2010 , he had got into a rut			0
he decided to fly to @entity163 , even though he had just one contact — the organiser of a poetry - reading night — in the city			0
an early performance was seen by the actor and musician @entity170 who won an @entity171 for his role as singer @entity173 in the film @entity175			0
the pair struck up an unlikely friendship and the actor let the @entity8 lad record in his studio and stay in his @entity181 home			0
even better , @entity170 featured @entity1 ’s songs on his satellite radio music show , @entity184			1
pride of @entity41 : @entity1 , seen performing on the 2014 @entity186 , has been hailed as @entity41 ’s biggest cultural export since @entity49 ’s @entity48 this was noticed by an internet entrepreneur who plugged @entity1 on an online music channel that was popular with fans of the hip hop variant known as ‘ grime ’			1
suddenly , @entity1 was not only attracting fans on both sides of the @entity196 , but he was also managing to become popular with both white and black audiences			1
he still did n’t have a record deal , however , and was putting out new recordings at his own expense			0
by the time , in 2011 , he released no 5 @entity201 , a set of songs recorded with various ‘ grime ’ stars , the internet buzz about @entity1 was so great that it went to no. 2 in the @entity208 chart , selling 7,000 copies in the first week			1
@entity1 explained in the @entity210 — a newspaper whose business focus seems to be right up his street — that he had refused to sign to a label in the early years , willing to gamble he could make it initially on his own and so , by waiting , demand megabucks			1
his patience worked handsomely as he managed to hold out until the lead single from his debut album , a deceptively upbeat ballad called @entity220 about a crack - addicted prostitute , had become a huge chart hit in 2011			0
in the meantime he moved back to @entity28 , and when more than 1,000 fans went to see a free gig in @entity226 , @entity1 performed four shows to make sure everyone who wanted to could see him			1
after he eventually signed to the music giant @entity230 , @entity1 ’s will to win only redoubled			1
the buzz at @entity196 was about how former @entity233 officer @entity232 was the hardest - working performer in the industry			0
@entity1 got hold of @entity232 ’s schedule and told his team that they would do double what @entity232 did			1
‘ and that ’s exactly what i did , ’ he told the @entity210 ‘ because he was the hardest - working guy , i wanted to work as hard as him			1
’ twice as hard in fact			2
as the sales and awards piled up , he toured @entity246 in 2013 with @entity247 pop idol @entity23 who is now a close friend , as is @entity249 star @entity248 in whose @entity250 stayed last year writing music			1
the career - obsessed @entity1 makes no bones about wanting to do more than just put out songs			2
‘ i put all my time and effort into making my music successful , ’ he says			0
he was so determined to have the @entity132 no. 1 album that he went into the offices of music chain @entity259 and played for company bosses so they would give his cds a better position in their stores			0
it ’s impressive that he has any time for romance			2
although he been with girlfriend @entity269 for about a year , his romantic life used to be somewhat more colourful			0
he famously wrote a song about a woman who cheated on him			0
the ex in question is believed to have been singer @entity274 and the man she left him for to have been @entity277 star @entity276			2
he met @entity269 when she was the tour manager of a band who provided his support act			0
she now works for @entity281 but has also , @entity1 admits , put in some valuable work smartening up her boyfriend ’s on - stage appearance			1
still , why is he so gobsmackingly popular ? critics have always been lukewarm about him , citing bland tunes and cliched lyrics			0
but what do they matter when teenagers the world over regard @entity1 as ‘ one of them ’ ? and middle - aged mums and dads are also fans			2
what ’s more , they are impressed by his relentless drive — and his apparently natural image combining the sweetly shambolic ‘ boy next door ’ and the hard - nosed entrepreneur who pulled himself up by his bootstraps .			1

@entity1 is the perfect @entity72 pop star , ' writes @entity303
he has been hailed @entity41 ’s biggest cultural export since @entity48
his success is down to hard work , rather than image and managers
