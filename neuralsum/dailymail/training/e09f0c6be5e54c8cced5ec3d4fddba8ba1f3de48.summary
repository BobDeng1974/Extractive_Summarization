by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 1 may 2012 updated : 09:40 est , 5 may 2012 a young mother was killed by a party drug while marking the death hours earlier of a friend who had taken the same substance			1
@entity6 , 28 , collapsed in front of friends she had invited to her house after the death of @entity11 , 24			1
both are believed to have taken @entity13 , which comes in liquid form and is mixed with soft drinks			1
tragic pair : @entity11 , left , died after apparently taking @entity13 - just hours before his friend @entity6 , right , died after allegedly using the same party drug fresh agony : miss @entity6 's home in @entity21 , where she died during a memorial party for mr @entity11 at 9pm on the day of his death saturday ’s deaths are the latest linked to the @entity26 drug that can be purchased legally as an alloy - wheel cleaner			1
known to clubbers as ‘ coma in a bottle ’ , @entity13 achieved notoriety three years ago when it claimed the life of medical student @entity33 , whose mother now campaigns to raise awareness of its dangers			1
@entity13 is usually diluted with water or juice and is virtually tasteless , but produces a high not dissimilar to ecstasy			1
it can damage the kidneys , liver and the stomach lining and can lead to psychosis			1
once in the body , chemical reactions turn @entity13 into now notorious drug @entity47 , which was banned in 2003 because it was being used as a date rape drug			1
although legal for use in the chemical industry - in cleaning products , solvents and paints - it has been banned for recreational use since 2009 and is a @entity26 drug			1
deaths that have been linked with @entity13 include that of @entity58 , 24 , who drowned in her bath in october 2007			1
@entity61 medical student @entity33 died in april after taking @entity13 and drinking alcohol			1
a 25 - year - old man died hours after taking @entity13 on its own while out clubbing in 2008			1
but because traces of @entity13 remain in the body for only up to 12 hours after consumption , the true number of fatalities is unknown			1
family and friends yesterday spoke of their shock at losing @entity72 , an accountant with a ten - year - old son			2
mr @entity11 , an @entity74 engineer and former @entity76 holiday rep , is thought to have collapsed on friday night at a party in @entity78			1
his body was discovered on saturday afternoon			0
a few hours later miss @entity6 invited grieving friends to her flat in the @entity21 area of the city , where she was found dead that evening			1
two male guests were taken to hospital with overdoses but have since been discharged			0
police are treating both deaths as unexplained while toxicology tests are carried out			0
miss @entity6 ’s father , @entity90 , 69 , said : ‘ was it that their drink was spiked ? from what i ’ve read , this @entity13 has no taste and no smell			1
it could easily have been slipped into a drink			2
they could have been oblivious to it			0
’ mr @entity72 , who has custody of his grandson @entity100 , heard from his daughter on saturday when she called to tell him of mr @entity11 ’s death			2
‘ she was sobbing her heart out and was in bits over his death , ’ he added			0
‘ there was no mention of drugs			0
the last thing she said was that she would phone us later on			0
the whole family is in shock			0
‘ i want to know how many other people will have to die before something is done about @entity13			2
it ’s a lethal drug			2
’ miss @entity6 ’s cousin , @entity118 , said : ‘ @entity6 was always sensible , a nice girl who worked hard			2
she liked to party and drink with her friends			2
‘ she went to festivals and had fun but i really did n’t think she would dabble in something like this , especially after her friend died			0
‘ i just feel for her son and her parents			0
my dad went round to see them and @entity6 ’s mum collapsed in his arms			2
@entity90 had a heart attack when he was told			0
it ’s just such a shock			0
’ rave drug : both @entity72 , left , and mr @entity11 , right , had apparently used the legal high often used for making alloy wheels kind - hearted : miss @entity6 was described by her heartbroken parents @entity90 and @entity142 as a ' golden girl who would help anybody ' dark day : three people were taken to hospital after the wake held for @entity74 worker mr @entity11 @entity149 , whose @entity150 campaigns for drugs education in schools , said : ‘ it is unforgiveable that two people have died taking the same stuff in the same day			1
‘ young people think it is just a party drug but withdrawals when you take @entity13 are worse than heroin			1
‘ it is a horrendous drug			0
if they knew what it did , no one in their right mind would take it			0
‘ the problem is people do n’t care enough			0
my daughter was an athlete and a medical student – the least likely person to have taken it			0
but she died three years ago and there is still no national campaign			0
the government has been given enough information			0
’ neighbours yesterday described the drug - fuelled wake that cost @entity72 her life			2
@entity178 said : ‘ they were having a wake to honour their friend who died and , quite stupidly , they did this by taking the same drug which killed him			1
’ another , 24 - year - old @entity186 , said : ‘ i heard they put it in a @entity190 bottle and several of them ended up being taken to hospital			0
’ shocking episode : mr @entity11 died at his city centre flat and @entity72 at her home later the same night @entity197 , a 43 - year - old former paramedic , paid tribute to mr @entity11 , saying : ‘ @entity11 was loved by so many , he really was one of a million			1
he was the most genuine and lovely guy			0
’ @entity199 , a detective inspector for @entity200 , said : ‘ we believe that the controlled substance @entity13 or @entity13 , the base solvent to a number of alloy wheel cleaners , super glue removers and paint strippers , may have been used as a drug at the gathering at the address in @entity21			1
’ post-mortem examinations into the deaths of the deaths have proved inconclusive			0
@entity13 , which has a similar effect to ecstasy , was banned in december 2009 following a spate of deaths			2
users take it in tiny quantities , measuring it in a syringe before mixing it with juice .			0

@entity11 died at his flat after allegedly taking the drug the night before
mother - of - one @entity6 died during memorial party for him at her flat later the same day
@entity13 is a @entity26 drug used in cleaning products , solvents and paints
it can damage the kidneys , liver and stomach lining and lead to psychosis
