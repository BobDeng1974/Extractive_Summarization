a tiny home in south west @entity1 that measures just eight and a half feet wide has gone on the market for £ 300,000			2
sandwiched between two normal - sized houses , the property in @entity4 still manages to contain a fully equipped kitchen and two beds , though one of them is snuggled up on a mezzanine level above the fridge , and the other is tucked into the sitting room			1
despite its small size , it backs on to a huge garden that has almost five times as much space as the property itself			2
the house has 322sq ft of living space , compared to the lawn which measures 1,562sq ft. tiny terrace : this skinny property in @entity4 , south west @entity1 , measures just eight and a half foot wide with 322sq ft of space huge : by contrast the lawn at the back of the house measures 1,562sq ft , making it nearly five times larger than the interior narrow : the living room opens out on to this narrow walkway , but through the gate at the end of the path is the property 's huge garden kitted out : it may not look like it from the outside , but the house has a fully furnished kitchen along with two beds , though on is tucked away on a mezzanine above the fridge , and the other is in the living room cosy : the home was originally built as a granny flat and was attached to one of the neighbouring properties , but has since been turned into a home of its own the garden also contains a shed which measures 17.7ft by 6.5ft , making it significantly wider than the main building			1
the skinny property was originally built as a ' granny flat ' for the house next door , but is now being sold as one unit			1
set back from the main road , it comes with its own driveway and off - street parking			0
the previous owner had tried to get permission several years ago to knock down the main home , turn it into a driveway and have the garden turned into a house , but the local authority rejected the application			1
although it 's only been on the market for a week , @entity78 , who is handling the sale for estate agent @entity80 has been overwhelmed by interest			0
@entity78 said : ' it 's a fantastic property but quite an unusual one to show people round			0
it 's a bit of a marmite house - people either love it or hate it - but i think it will be sold very quickly			0
' though i do n't think it 's one for two people unless you 're very close ! i 've never seen anything like it - especially because the garden is so large			0
' we 're certainly enjoying having it on our books			0
' home sweet home : the estate agents have described it as a ' marmite ' property , saying viewers either love it or hate it , but in spite of that say they have had plenty of interest bedroom : the second bed ( left ) is located towards the back of the property in the reception , come living , come sleeping space nestled in : one of the bedrooms sits on a mezzanine level above the kitchen with the single bed tucked away in this corner single : the house may have two bedrooms , but the estate agents say the house is best suited to one person , unless the couple are very close tucked away : this floor plan shows how the miniature property is put together , running in a single line from the kitchen at the front , through to the bathroom and studio bedroom , then out into the huge garden at the back			1
