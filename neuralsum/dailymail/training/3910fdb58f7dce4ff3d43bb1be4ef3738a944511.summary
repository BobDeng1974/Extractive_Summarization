@entity1 ’s political career came to a humiliating end last night when he lost his bid to be elected as a @entity4			1
voters in @entity6 rejected the former deputy prime minister , @entity9 ’s most high - profile candidate , and elected a little - known @entity10 instead			1
lord @entity1 was the most significant casualty on a day of political bloodbaths for the three major parties , which saw voter turnout at record lows			1
the nationwide turnout of just over 14 per cent was the worst on record in a nationwide poll , as ballot boxes in some polling stations were left empty when not one single voter showed up			2
in a further blow for the establishment parties , the @entity21 @entity31 recorded some of its best results ever , seizing votes from the @entity10 and pushing the @entity22 into fourth place in several seats			2
former deputy prime minister @entity1 failed in his bid to return to elected office , beaten by @entity10 @entity41 as counting continued , @entity1 was seen emerging from a nearby bar lord @entity1 led after the first round of votes in @entity6 , but when second preferences were taken into account the 74 - year - old was overtaken by councillor and @entity10 candidate @entity41			1
after his defeat by more than 2,000 votes – on a turnout of just 19 per cent he polled 39,933 to mr @entity41 ’s 42,164 – lord @entity1 said he did not think he would stand for election again			1
in a characteristically long , rambling losing speech , he criticised the creation of the post he had hoped to fill , and complained about the cost of the poll			2
he said : ‘ i said at the beginning , this is a @entity10 marginal seat			2
it ’s not a safe @entity9 seat			1
it ’s not even a @entity9 seat			1
it would have been nice but it was n’t so			2
’ addressing public disinterest in the elections , he went on : ' they did n't turn out in the numbers that anyone would want			2
' we have got a low turnout and i do n't think that 's an easy thing to live with			2
' lord @entity1 struggled to hide his disappointment as @entity41 addressed the hall at @entity79 lord @entity1 stood for the election despite having vocally criticised the creation of the new police chief posts			1
he is now expected to return to the @entity83			0
it is his first personal experience of electoral defeat since he stood for @entity87 in 1970			0
if he had won , he would have taken home an estimated £ 155,000 from taxpayers in salary and pension payouts			0
the peer gave an indication of his electoral chances when he told waiting reporters to ' b * * * * * off ' earlier on friday after they asked if he was feeling confident			1
@entity10 mp for @entity98 , @entity99 , said : ‘ the result in @entity6 shows that the local voters went for quality rather than quantity			0
‘ the last thing people want is a failed minister running their local police			1
they were offered a household name and they would rather have someone who is quietly competent			0
‘ the days when politics is dominated by so - called big beasts from @entity112 is coming to an end			1
’ @entity10 winner @entity41 paid tribute to @entity1 in his acceptance speech local businessman mr @entity41 , 49 , who runs a successful building services firm , has pledged to cut police red tape and sell off the expensive premises used by the @entity120 and use the money for a community crime fighting fund			1
the result was the silver lining on an otherwise dismal day for the @entity10 who saw the public react with a mixture of apathy and outright contempt for their flagship law and order policy			0
tens of thousands of voters spoiled their ballot papers in an apparent rejection of the new elected police chief roles			0
at one polling station in @entity139 , @entity140 , not a single vote was cast and ballot boxes were returned empty			0
the elections watchdog , the @entity142 , announced a review of the poll , saying turnout was ‘ a concern for everyone who cares about democracy ’			0
critics said low turnout meant the new police bosses – who will be paid up to £ 100,000 a year – would struggle to claim a mandate			2
lord @entity1 was ahead in the first round of counting , but when second preferences were distributed he lost by some 2,000 votes lord @entity1 is expected to return to the @entity83 , where he sits as a @entity9 peer @entity22 president @entity157 said it would be ‘ extremely difficult ’ for @entity159 to claim a mandate and warned their legitimacy would be ‘ compromised ’			1
@entity10 backbencher @entity162 , the mp for @entity163 , wrote on @entity164 : ‘ i suspect we will live to regret creating these @entity166			0
i regret voting for the @entity167			0
’ aside from @entity1 ’s defeat , a number of @entity9 ‘ retreads ’ and mps who featured in the expenses debacle were elected to @entity4 roles			1
@entity175 , who was forced to repay almost £ 20,000 in expenses blaming ‘ clerical errors ’ , was elected in @entity140			0
@entity178 , who stood down as an mp after complaining about a ban on employing her partner in the @entity181 , won the @entity183 poll			0
@entity184 , the former solicitor general , who put through a £ 286 expenses claim for festive decorations , won @entity187			0
the vote threw up a number of surprise results , including the @entity10 losing @entity191 to an independent , the former @entity120 chairman , but winning @entity193 - @entity192 , expected to be a @entity9 win			1
a @entity9 spokesman pointed to its win in @entity198 despite the seat being 24th on its target list			1
a former judge won in @entity203 and seven former police officers were elected			0
elected commissioners will set the priorities for policing in their force areas			0
they will have some control over budgets and , significantly , will hold the power to hire and fire the chief constable .			0

*conservative* @entity41 beat his @entity9 rival by 42,164 to 39,933
74 - year - old earlier told reporters to ' b * * * * * off ' when they asked if he was feeling confident
