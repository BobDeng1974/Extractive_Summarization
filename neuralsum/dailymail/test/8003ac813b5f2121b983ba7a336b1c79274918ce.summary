@entity2 founder @entity1 ' widow @entity0 has told of her admiration for @entity6 @entity5 front - runner @entity4			1
ms @entity7 , 51 , called former first lady @entity4 a ' revolutionary ' woman , and added that it 's not just because she 's a woman - but ' the type of woman she is '			1
speaking to @entity13 , ms @entity7 said : ' @entity4 is not familiar			1
not radical , but revolutionary : the distinction is crucial			2
she is one of @entity17 ’s greatest modern creations			1
@entity7 , pictured , widow of @entity2 's @entity1 , has strongly backed @entity4 for president @entity7 said that @entity4 , right , has ' judgment and wisdom ' based on her public service ' her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities			1
indeed , those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks : judgment , and even wisdom			0
' it matters , of course , that @entity4 is a woman			1
but what matters more is what kind of woman she is			0
' mrs @entity4 announced her intention to seek the @entity6 nomination on sunday - and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet ' ordinary ' voters in @entity41			1
but she was blasted for her ' staged ' visit on tuesday morning to a coffee shop in @entity44 , @entity41			1
@entity45 , one of the men pictured sitting at the table with mrs @entity4 , claimed the whole event was orchestrated ' from beginning to end '			1
staged : @entity49 sat to talk with three young iowans at a coffee shop on tuesday – all of whom were driven to the event by her @entity41 campaign 's political director not so ordinary : @entity45 is a @entity6 insider who chauffeured vice president @entity57 around @entity58 , @entity41 in october during a pre-election campaign trip @entity45 told @entity60 that campaign staffer @entity61 called and asked him and two other young people to meet him tuesday morning at a restaurant in @entity58 , a nearby city			1
@entity61 then drove them to the coffee house to meet @entity49 after vetting them for about a half - hour			2
the three got the lion 's share of mrs. @entity4 's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a ' roundtable ' – the first of many in her brief @entity41 campaign swing			1
bird himself is a frequent participant in @entity78 events			0
he interned with president @entity81 's 2012 presidential re-election campaign , and was tapped to chauffeur vice president @entity57 in october 2014 when he visited @entity58			2
' what happened is , we were just asked to be there by @entity85 , ' @entity45 said wednesday in a phone interview			0
' we were asked to come to a meeting with @entity85 , the three of us , at the @entity88			0
' the other two , he confirmed , were @entity91 president @entity90 and @entity92 of the @entity94 employee @entity93			0
' it was supposed to be a strategy meeting , ' @entity45 recalled , ' to get our thoughts about issues			0
but then all of a sudden he says , " hey , we have secretary @entity49 coming in , would you like to go meet her ? " ' ' and then we got in a car – @entity85 's car – and we went up to the coffee house , and we sat at a table and then @entity4 just came up and talked with us			1
' @entity45 said ' we all were called			0
' ' i mean , @entity85 asked us all to do – to go to a meeting with him			0
and we did n't really know what it was about			0
i mean , he did			0
' it 's unclear how many @entity112 featured in photographs with @entity49 that rocketed around the country on tuesday were planted			2
' the mayor of @entity116 was there , and his wife was there , ' @entity45 said , recalling the scene at the coffee shop			0
@entity61 was executive director of the @entity78 until a month ago			0
@entity49 's team tapped him last week to be its political director in @entity41			1
he did not respond to a request for comment			0
bird is a government and community relations coordinator at @entity128 in @entity58 , @entity41 , according to his @entity130 profile			1
a coworker at @entity132 said wednesday that @entity45 is ' basically a lobbyist in training			0
that 's what he wants to do			2
' @entity45 disagreed , saying his role was ' more public relations			0
' he 's also an outspoken progressive whose @entity140 wall shows he ordered a ' @entity142 ' bumper sticker 22 months ago			2
' is it 2016 yet ? ' he wrote in may 2013			0
@entity49 's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous , handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate , posing with @entity149 at a gas station and venturing into an @entity152 restaurant for lunch			2
when no one recognized the former first lady – she was wearing sunglasses – the campaign leaked information to the @entity159 so its reporters could get security - camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters			1
scripting supposedly off - the - cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt @entity49 especially hard since her gonzo road - trip journey to @entity17 's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold , calculating and politically venomous			1
and planting party insiders in place of typical @entity112 wo n't go over well in the @entity41 , where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full - contact sport			1
@entity174 : setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics , but @entity112 take presidential contests seriously and could punish @entity49 for the deception the fixer : @entity45 said @entity182 ( left , pictured with vp @entity57 ) , who was executive director of the @entity78 until he left last month to help @entity49 's statewide political effort , recruited him and others to attend the ' spontaneous ' coffee meeting @entity49 's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as ' everyday ' @entity17 who were actually partisans with political connections			1
one was even a former campaign manager for @entity194 , the @entity196 @entity195 who mounted a failed bid for @entity196 governor last year			0
in @entity116 on tuesday , @entity199 and other outlets referred to @entity45 as a ' student ' at @entity202 , not as a hospital government - affairs staffer with @entity6 street - cred			1
he does study at @entity205 – part - time			2
but @entity45 's ties to the party are deep enough that his @entity140 wall includes a photo of him standing in front of @entity57 's limousine in @entity58			2
' i was driving the vice president when he was in town in october , ' @entity45 noted in a @entity140 comment			0
@entity57 was not there on official government business , but for a campaign stop in support of @entity195 @entity220			0
' the vice president will attend a grassroots event for @entity220 for @entity41 with representative @entity222 , ' according to @entity5 press guidance for his october 27 , 2014 schedule .			2
