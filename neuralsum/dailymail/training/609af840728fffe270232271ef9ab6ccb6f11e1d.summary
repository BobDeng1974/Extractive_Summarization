' threatening ' : he shouted and swore at @entity27 in front of children from @entity108 in @entity20 ' he got out and walked up to the @entity27 and squared up to him			1
i thought it was going to come to fisticuffs and he was going to punch him			0

he would n't let him speak and was shouting over him			0
' he told him he earned £ 80,000 a year so he can afford the ticket and he was moving to @entity174 for two or three months , so it did n't matter if he got any points			2

we wish to make clear that a previous version of this article contained *inaccuracies* . we incorrectly *reported* that the incident took place in *november* 2012 rather than july 2012 and it did not take place during ***“*** road *safety* week ***”*** . mr @entity2 *disputes* the claim he lives in a luxury £ 300k flat and . mr @entity2 has asked us to **clarify** that he is not a *telecoms* boss . he has asked us to **clarify** that he did *n’t* say to the @entity25 that ***“*** it was a f * * * ing joke *…* ***”*** but does accept that he said ***“*** you *’re* @entity27 and not even proper pigs ***”*** . mr @entity2 has also pointed out that the children had gone inside by the time the regular constable had arrived and therefore the children were not upset by his aggressive outburst .
mr @entity2 was convicted of a section 5 public order **offence** section 5 ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) or the 1986 public order act fine £ *800* , and £ 200 for a @entity229 speeding **offence** , and cleared of two counts of *criminal* damage .
