@entity0 has defended his £ 23.6million investment in @entity2 and insisted @entity3 have not paid over the odds for the @entity6 midfielder			1
@entity2 officially started his @entity3 career this week here in @entity9 and has made an immediate impression on the training pitches at @entity12 with his slick use of the ball and willingness to embrace hard work			1
yet , for all that , the size of @entity2 ’s fee has been scrutinised , not least because @entity37 only paid £ 1m more to take @entity39 winner @entity38 from @entity40 ; @entity0 , however , believes @entity2 will prove he has value , maintaining @entity3 were not held to ransom in negotiations			1
‘ for @entity51 players across the board there is always that premium and the value is always pushed up , ’ said @entity0 , whose side played the first game of their @entity47 tour against @entity48 in the early hours of this morning			1
‘ we paid what we thought he was worth and would not go higher			2
‘ listen , i spoke to enough people about him and have seen enough of him , and know enough people who had seen him and played with him to know he would be a great signing for us			2
i have no qualms about it			2
he is a great boy			0
bright future : @entity0 ( left ) describes £ 20million signing @entity17 ( right ) as an ' exciting talent ' at @entity3 ‘ the types of players we bring in will have the profile of what we want , so the transition should be smooth			1
of course , it will be strange for them at times coming into a new team , but you see it with @entity2 straight away he presses for the ball when he does not have it and he has beautiful balance			1
‘ he can score goals and create goals			0
he is a wonderful footballer			0
i have been impressed by his mentality and character			1
was he our main signing ? they are all big signings as they will all make a big contribution			1
i need them to do that with being in the @entity88 this year			0
’ so far @entity2 has been one of five new signings but there will be more to come , with @entity92 ’s £ 8.5m switch from @entity93 expected to be made official on thursday and confidence mounting that they will also land @entity24 ’s £ 20m defender @entity97			1
debut : @entity2 ( centre ) will get his first taste of @entity3 action during their pre-season @entity47 tour video new @entity3 signing eyes @entity103 trophy once @entity0 completes his overhaul , he will have paid out more than £ 100m and that , inevitably , means @entity3 ’s performances will be put under the microscope , just as @entity109 were dissected 12 months ago after investing a similar amount following the sale of @entity112			1
such a major outlay invites pressure yet that does not unsettle @entity0			1
he argues his spending has been responsible and explains there is a plan to what @entity3 have done ; some fans on @entity121 have clamoured for him to sign a ‘ big ’ name but he is n’t a manager who will spend for the sake of it			0
‘ i have always said at every club i ’ve been at , the club ’s money is my money , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’m there to serve the club and run it the best i can on the field and work with the owners off it			2
they know i push for the best players to come in and they gain the trust with how we work			0
support : @entity0 signs autographs for adoring fans at @entity142 in @entity9 ‘ there is money available but we know spending money does not guarantee success			1
last january everyone was crying out that we needed more signings			2
ok , we might have done one or two but it was not a major factor in us not winning ( the title )			0
‘ the players we ’ve brought in were players we wanted anyway			0
it was well documented our squad last year was too thin so we needed to bring in players to get that level and depth up			0
our signings are strategic signings			2
they are not just names			0
they all fit into the purpose of the team ‘ if that means we do not spend all the money or the net spend is the same , then so be it			0
it is not just about the player , but the right type of person			0
i want players that are committed to the cause to make @entity3 the best they can be			0
’ prepare : @entity3 train at @entity142 ahead of their friendly with @entity48 on wednesday evening			0

@entity0 says he is delighted at the efforts of new signings @entity17 and @entity2
@entity0 is impressed at how quickly both have settled at the club
@entity17 cost £ 20million from @entity20 , while @entity2 was bought for £ 23.6million from @entity24
