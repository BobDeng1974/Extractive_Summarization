by @entity0 air pollution in @entity4 and other @entity6 countries is causing storms in @entity8 to become stronger and changing weather patterns across the @entity10 , a new @entity2 study has claimed			1
researchers found that pollutants are strengthening storms above the @entity14 , which feeds into weather systems in other parts of the world			1
the effect was most pronounced during the winter , the team said			1
the key to the changes in weather is the @entity14 storm track			1
this represents a critical driver in the general global circulation by transporting heat and moisture around the world , the team said			0
the transfer of heat and moisture appears to be increased over the storm track downstream , meaning that the @entity14 storm track is intensified because of the @entity6 air pollution outflow			1
lead author @entity41 , from the @entity42 at the @entity43 , said : ' there appears to be little doubt that these particles from @entity6 affect storms sweeping across the @entity14 and subsequently the weather patterns in @entity8 and the rest of the world			1
' the effects are quite dramatic			0
' the pollution results in thicker and taller clouds and heavier precipitation			0
' @entity14 winter storms are now 10 percent stronger than they were 30 years ago , the team said			1
the study is published in the @entity58			0
in the first study of its kind , scientists compared air pollution rates from 1850 to 2000 and found that anthropogenic ( man - made ) particles from @entity6 impact the @entity14 storm track that can influence weather over much of the world			1
the team used detailed pollution emission data compiled by the @entity72 and looked at two scenarios : one for a rate in 1850 – the pre-industrial era – and from 2000 , termed present - day			0
by comparing the results from an advanced global climate model , the team found that anthropogenic aerosols conclusively impact cloud formations and mid-latitude cyclones associated with the @entity14 storm track			2
' the climate model is quite clear on this point , ' said @entity41			0
' the aerosols formed by human activities from fast - growing @entity6 economies do impact storm formation and global air circulation downstream			0
researchers found that pollutants are strengthening storms above the @entity14 , which feeds into weather systems in other parts of the world , leading to heavier rainfall across @entity8 ' they tend to make storms deeper and stronger and more intense , and these storms also have more precipitation in them			1
' we believe this is the first time that a study has provided such a global perspective			0
' in addition , @entity104 says large amounts of aerosols and their long - term transport from @entity6 across the @entity14 can clearly be seen by satellite images			2
the @entity14 storm track represents a critical driver in the general global circulation by transporting heat and moisture , the team notes			2
the transfer of heat and moisture appears to be increased over the storm track downstream , meaning that the @entity14 storm track is intensified because of the @entity6 air pollution outflow			2
' our results support previous findings that show that particles in the air over @entity6 tend to affect global weather patterns , ' @entity104 adds			0
' it shows they can affect the @entity129 ’s weather significantly			0

pollutants are strengthening storms above the @entity14
these feed into weather systems in other parts of the world
effect was most pronounced during the winter
