@entity1 anchor @entity0 revealed on @entity2 today she has breast cancer and will undergo a double mastectomy on thursday			1
in september , the 40 - year - old mother - of - two was asked by the producer of the show if she would take a mammogram live on air to raise awareness for breast cancer for their ' @entity12 ' day			1
she reluctantly agreed - and it was a decision that saved her life			2
on october 1 , in front of millions of people , @entity0 took her mammogram , breathing a sigh of relief when it was over			2
she remembered @entity21 - herself a breast cancer survivor - telling her : ' if you get the mammogram and it saves just one life then it 's all worth it			2
a mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast which is used to check for cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease			1
it allows the doctor to have a closer look for changes in breast tissue that can not be felt during a breast exam			2
it can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer in women aged 40 to 70			1
mammograms have been controversial and some women have been reluctant to go through with the screening			1
potential harm includes false - negative results , false - positive results , over-diagnosis , over-treatment , and radiation exposure			2
during a mammogram , your breasts are placed between an x-ray plate and a plastic plate which are then attached to the x-ray machine before the breasts are flattened			2
this spreads the breast tissue out to obtain a clearer picture			2
pressure will be felt on the breast for a few seconds and there might be some discomfort but this will only last a few seconds			0
the whole procedure from start to finish lasts for 20 minutes			0
a few weeks later , she was asked to come back to the doctors and was so unconcerned , she did n't even bring anyone with her			1
' i thought i was going back in for a few follow - up images , only to find out in a matter of hours that i had breast cancer , ' @entity0 wrote on her @entity1 blog			1
' i was alone that afternoon , never thinking to bring anyone with me , never thinking that day would be life - altering			0
' my husband was on a business trip and my parents live across the country , but that night everyone flew into @entity119 and we started gearing up for a fight			1
' she spoke on @entity2 this morning about the experience and how it has affected her and her family			0
' @entity21 and @entity1 saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram			1
' when i was asked , i want to say i was happy to do my part but honestly i was a little reluctant at first			1
i 'd been asked to do it on air to demystify it for women who might be nervous			1
' i 'm 40 and i had been putting it off for a number of years - between flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school , ballet and gymnastics			0
like so many women i just kept pushing it off			1
' telling my children was the toughest part and yesterday i had to tell my grandmother - who is not in the best of health			0
' i have to be strong now for other people because i am about to break their hearts			0
' by her side : @entity0 's husband @entity54 was there at the @entity1 studios to support his wife as she made the heartbreaking announcement alone : @entity0 said she did not even bring her husband @entity157 to the second appointment with the doctor because she thought it was nothing family : @entity0 said she is being strong for her children because she realizes telling them she has cancer will break their hearts driving force : @entity0 , 40 , chose the most aggressive form of treatment - a double mastectomy - because she has young children and much to live for , saying she did n't want the chance of a second bout hanging over her she wrote on her blog : ' on thursday , november 14 , i will go into surgery where my doctors will perform a bilateral mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery			1
' only then will i know more about what that fight will fully entail , but i am mentally and physically as prepared as anyone can be in this situation			0
' and while everyone who gets cancer is clearly unlucky , i got lucky by catching it early , and there are so many people to thank for making sure i did			0
' every producer , every person who urged me to do this , changed my trajectory			1
the doctors told me bluntly : " that mammogram just saved your life "			0
' @entity0 married her second husband - melrose place actor @entity54 - in 2010 after meeting him at a book party			0
she has two daughters to her first husband @entity197 , who she divorced in 2009			0
before she moved to @entity1 , @entity0 was the @entity198 weekend host			1
she left @entity199 in may 2012			0
@entity21 returned to @entity2 in february this year , left , still sporting a bald head from chemotherapy and right , back to her usual self at the @entity204 last week together again : @entity21 introduced the show and grinned alongside her fellow @entity2 hosts in february @entity21 recently returned to @entity2 after her own battle with breast cancer			1
she was first diagnosed in 2007 after discovering a lump during a self - examination			0
she also made the brave decision to announce her illness on air			1
what followed was a partial mastectomy , chemotherapy and radiation until she finally got the all clear			2
then in 2012 , she was diagnosed with mds or myelodysplastic syndrome , which is a disease of the blood and bone marrow which was once known as pre-leukemia			0
be the @entity224 , a nonprofit organization run by the @entity225 , experienced a 1,800 per cent spike in donors the day @entity21 went public with her illness			0
she took a leave from @entity2 to get a bone marrow transplant in october 2012 but her recovery was documented on the morning show before she returned to @entity2 on february 20 of this year			0

the @entity1 anchor was asked by the producer if she would undergo a mastectomy live on air
wanted to demystify it for women who might be nervous about getting one
when she was called back she did not think there was any reason for concern
treating it aggressively by having double mastectomy
will not know how serious it is until after the operation
