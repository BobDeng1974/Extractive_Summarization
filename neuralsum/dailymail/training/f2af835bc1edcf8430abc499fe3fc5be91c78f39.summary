the scoreline at @entity1 flattered @entity2 as @entity4 's side eventually prevailed 3 - 1 against @entity6 strugglers @entity5			1
defender @entity7 scored a brace to show @entity2 's misfiring strikers how its done			1
despite winning @entity2 we booed by their own supporters as the @entity1 fans appear increasingly frustrated by the football lacking ambition , invention and dominance under @entity4			1
@entity19 's @entity18 gives you the lowdown on how the players performed at @entity1			1
@entity2 ( 4 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 2 ) @entity23 - 6.5 powerless to prevent @entity25 header			1
reaction save to keep @entity2 ahead at 2 - 1			1
@entity2 defender @entity28 had to leave the field and be replaced early on with injury @entity28 - 5 outmuscled by @entity31 early on in what could have been a costly error and came off injured before five minutes had elapsed			1
@entity34 - 6 @entity36 ’s best player on a night the bar was set about half an inch off the floor			2
an island of calm in a red sea of madness			0
@entity2 defender @entity34 puts in a robust tackle on @entity5 's @entity25 @entity45 - 5 an uncomfortable night for the @entity46			1
all over the shop and misguided header to give away a corner under no pressure summed it up			0
@entity52 - 6 full of energy going forward and stung @entity55 's gloves from distance to win the corner that led to the opener			2
struggled to deal with @entity58 at times			0
@entity59 - 6 like the kid in the playground who stays back while all his mates try and grab the glory before retiring with a nasty - looking cut			2
@entity67 @entity66 holds off a challenge from @entity69 at @entity1 on wednesday evening @entity66 - 6.5 guilty of giving possession away but laid @entity7 ’s second on a plate with an accurate cross and a menace with his pace on the break			1
trickery too much for @entity79 to win penalty			2
@entity81 - 6 @entity2 fans had called for him to be moved forwards from his role on the right of the diamond but when @entity59 came off he went backwards to holding midfielder			2
rightly carded for foul on the excellent @entity25			0
@entity81 , deployed again in midfield , challenges for the ball with @entity5 's @entity92 at @entity1 @entity93 - 6 @entity94 for long periods and seemed to try and take on one man too many			1
@entity97 shot easily held by @entity55 but little joy for the tricky @entity99			0
@entity100 - 6 could not combine effectively with @entity101 in a one - paced top two before smashing home his penalty			1
the 90 minutes will be welcome but can do much better than this			0
@entity101 - 5.5 did well to nod back for @entity7 to score but otherwise poor			1
ball bounced off him more than once and left home support frustrated			0
booked for what appeared to be a nasty elbow and hooked shortly after			0
@entity110 striker @entity101 ( centre ) was once again ineffective for @entity4 's side subs @entity7 ( @entity28 5 ) - 6 headed @entity2 in front 22 seconds after replacing @entity28 and repeated the trick to save @entity116 ’s side from a half - time booing			1
nowhere near @entity25 and defensively poor			0
only a six because of the goals			0
@entity119 ( @entity120 39 ) - 5.5 involved in a terrible mx - up with @entity7 and failed to offer the muscle @entity2 desperately needed in the middle of the park			1
will be grateful to be noticed , regardless			0
@entity125 ( @entity101 74 ) - 6 on long enough to pick up a yellow			2
a coincidence @entity2 improved after his arrival ? hit side - netting late on			1
@entity2 defender @entity7 scored a brace on wednesday but did n't defend too confidently @entity5 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity55 - 6 perhaps could have caught @entity52 ’s shot which led to the corner from which malling scored his first but could do little about the second			1
@entity136 - 6.5 ex-city man surged down the right before teeing up @entity25 to equalise with a pinpoint cross and was a threat coming forward with superb delivery			2
@entity5 defender @entity136 battles for possession with @entity2 centre back @entity34 @entity144 - 6 coped well with the threat of @entity146 and @entity101 and will wonder how he ended up on the losing side			1
@entity149 - 6 the @entity151 man , born down the road in @entity153 , did well alongside @entity144 but failed to get the result he would have craved			2
@entity58 - 6.5 wasted a chance to level when he dallied too long on a one - on - one with @entity156			0
booked for a trip on a breaking @entity158 but had little option and blasted a great chance to level wide late on before being subbed			0
@entity92 - 6.5 strong presence in the heart of midfield and was everything @entity2 lacked as @entity5 bossed the first half for long periods			1
@entity5 forward @entity69 was a constant menace for @entity2 to deal with at @entity1 @entity69 - 6 another @entity5 nuisance , his cross had @entity7 and @entity119 at sixes and sevens as @entity5 pressed for an equaliser at the start of the second half			1
@entity31 - 6 almost a dream return when he outmuscled @entity28 earlier on but nodded a corner wide in front of the @entity179 by @entity7 for the first			2
@entity79 - 6 booked for a needless challenge on @entity119 but a strong physical presence in a midfield battle the visitors often dominated			0
outwitted by @entity158 for penalty			0
@entity186 - 6 @entity188 ’s looping pass wide at the end of a sweeping move			2
combined well with @entity25 but tired in the second half before being replaced by @entity192			0
@entity193 striker @entity25 scored for @entity5 and caused a host of problems for @entity2 @entity25 - 7.5 ghosted in to head @entity5 level			1
caused plenty of problems early on and set @entity186 only for his strike partner to blaze over			0
looks the real deal , really does			0
subs @entity203 ( @entity58 86 ) - 5 the game was gone by the time he entered the fray			0
@entity192 ( @entity186 90 +1 ) - 5 three - minute cameo not long enough to make an impact .			0

@entity4 's side prevailed 3 - 1 at @entity1 against @entity5
@entity7 scored a brace and @entity100 hit a late penalty
@entity2 move back up to *3rd* in the @entity6
