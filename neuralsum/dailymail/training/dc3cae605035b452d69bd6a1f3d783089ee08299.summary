@entity0 was fortunate not to be substituted at half - time as @entity2 , fearing a second away defeat in four days , made two changes to his lacklustre side			1
and it is just as well he kept faith with the striker he suspects is still feeling the effects of surgery on a broken kneecap , for within three minutes of the restart he had pounced to claim a point			0
‘ that ’s why you leave players like @entity0 on , because he ’s a goalscorer , ’ said @entity2 , whose side have lost just once in nine games and that at @entity17 on saturday			1
‘ @entity0 is @entity0 , he will always sniff a chance out , he ’s done that in every game he has ever played for us			1
’ the @entity104 frontman was making his first start since november 1 , absent or reduced to cameo roles from the bench in the meantime amid concerns over his fitness			2
and on the evidence of his first - half display — in which he lashed one chance horribly over the bar — @entity0 was , as suspected , far from his sharpest			1
that , though , could be said of every one of his @entity22 team - mates as they entered the break trailing to @entity24 ’s 34th - minute blast			1
@entity2 said : ‘ it was hard to watch that first half			0
they close the game down and make it hard for you			2
‘ i was pleased to see our fans stayed for the second half , because the last 20 minutes of the first half was tough			0
i was n’t angry at half - time , i just felt we lost our verve to get on the ball			1
once we did that the pitch and the game opened up			1
i brought some technical players on and we took risks and got our reward for it			0
’ the equaliser arrived when @entity72 centred from the right and @entity0 stole in to hook home his fifth goal of the season			2
but on a night when temperatures dipped below freezing , it was £ 12million substitute @entity82 who injected the energy and invention his side had previously lacked			0
‘ the big difference was @entity82 , who gave us technical ability , ’ said @entity2			0
‘ you might not expect that of an eight - stone @entity154 on a cold night at @entity23 , but he was excellent			1
‘ that ’s good news because we ’ve been waiting for him to come alive			0
he ’s been a slow - burner			2
he took the game by the scruff of the neck			2
he has to be a @entity162 type for us , get on the ball and run the game			0
’ in the end , a point proved fair for both sides and saw @entity23 move out of the relegation zone			1
@entity169 forward @entity83 ( left ) holds off @entity23 's @entity170 @entity22 's @entity77 takes a spectacular tumble after contesting for the ball with @entity23 's @entity60 @entity77 ( left ) goes toe to toe with @entity23 defender @entity56 in the early stages at @entity40 they took a deserved lead when @entity24 fired past former school friend @entity36 in the @entity22 goal			1
@entity53 loaded a ball forward from deep inside his own half , @entity60 jumped to nod back to the feet of @entity24 and he arrowed through bodies and beyond a motionless @entity36 from 20 yards			1
it could have been two before the break had @entity48 , darting into the area , not lashed wide in added - time			1
@entity23 manager @entity71 said : ‘ in the first half we were excellent and we had a real big chance before half - time to go in at 2 - 0			1
‘ we expected a reaction from them and we gave them that chance			0
it was a poor goal to concede			0
afterwards we had pockets of good play but so did they , they ’re a good side			0
‘ for all of their injuries they did quite well to bring @entity201 , @entity82 and @entity80 on			0
i wish we had those options			0
’ he added : ‘ we have to turn those “ so nearly ” games into three points and it ’s important we just concentrate on performances rather than the league table			0
’ @entity22 may well have made it seven wins in eight late on with @entity82 particularly impressive			2
the sight of their marquee summer signing finally starting to come good at the onset of winter will cheer @entity2 before saturday ’s visit of league leaders @entity218 to @entity219			0
but a fit and firing @entity0 is the man he knows can make the difference heading into the festive frenzy			2
@entity22 's @entity225 defender @entity72 ( left ) and @entity23 's @entity226 get into a tangle on the deck @entity22 manager @entity2 ( left ) shakes hands with @entity23 boss @entity71 before the match @entity231 is carried out of the pitch in a stretcher after his suffered an injury in the second half @entity22 's @entity76 ( left ) feels the full force of @entity238 's tackle @entity169 keeper @entity36 punts the ball downfield at @entity40 as the visitors go in search of winner			1

@entity24 fires @entity23 in front in the 34th minute
@entity0 equalises for @entity22 just after the break
@entity249 's strike prevents back - to - back away defeats for @entity169 in the space of just four days
this was the first ever @entity254 meeting between the two sides
the last time @entity23 and @entity22 met was was 31 years *ago* at @entity40
@entity23 won that game 1 - 0 in march 1983 in the old @entity259
@entity23 defender @entity56 leaves pitch on stretcher
