by @entity0 the beauty of the @entity2 could soon be smothered in sediment after @entity5 authorities approved plans to dredge the site			1
a number of local firms from @entity10 and surrounding areas want to use the nearby @entity13 port to export coal , and the dredging is necessary to allow ships to enter the port			1
the plans have been approved by the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , yet scientists are urging the authorities not to go through with them because the sediment could end up poisoning the fragile coral			1

the dredging is needed to let ships enter the port			0
scientists have claimed the sediment could poison wildlife and coral , pictured the @entity2 covers 1,429 miles and is so large it can be seen from outer space			1
marine creatures include 600 types of soft and hard corals , more than 100 species of jellyfish , 3000 varieties of molluscs , 500 species of worms , 1625 types of fish , 133 varieties of sharks and rays , and more than 30 species of whales and dolphins			0
it extends south from the northern tip of @entity10 in north - eastern @entity5 to just north of @entity54			2
the reef is an at risk @entity57 listed site that @entity59 believes could become an ' in danger ' later this year			1
in a statement , the @entity19 said : ' after rigorous assessment , the @entity19 has approved an application by @entity64 to dispose of dredge spoil at a deepwater location offshore of @entity13 , subject to strict environmental conditions			2
' it ’s important to note the seafloor of the approved disposal area consists of sand , silt and clay and does not contain coral reefs or seagrass beds			2
' yet it added it would consider an alternative location if one was found ' to be equal to or better in terms of environmental or heritage outcomes			0
' as a result , the authorities and scientists are investigating an area north of the port where the sediment could be dumped instead			2
this map shows the location of the port , at @entity13 ( in blue ) and the @entity2 ( in orange ) this map show the location of the port and the disposal site			1

at the start of january , 233 scientists signed a petition urging @entity19 to reject the proposals			0
@entity111 campaigner @entity110 slammed the decision as a ' disgrace '			0
' the government ’s priority should be to protect a reef which took millions of years to form , not take active steps to damage it , ' said @entity110			0
' @entity120 scientists have rung warning bells of the consequences of dredging and dumping on the reef			0
' this makes today ’s development an international embarrassment for the @entity10 and federal governments			0
' she warned the dumping is ' one more body blow for the reef ' and claimed the plans threaten marine life , its @entity57 status and ultimately @entity5 's tourism and fishing industries			1
