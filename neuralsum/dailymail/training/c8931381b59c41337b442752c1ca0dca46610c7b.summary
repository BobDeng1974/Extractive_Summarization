@entity0 developed diabetes due to stress the popular image of a patient with type 2 diabetes is someone who 's overweight , with a couch - potato lifestyle			1
it 's a stereotype that makes salesman @entity0 furious			1
the father - of - two , now 48 , developed the condition at the age of 44 when he had a 32 in waist and weighed only 12 st - almost ideal for his 5 ft 9 in height			2
as a keen windsurfer and diver who also walked his dog every day , he was physically fit			0
there was no family history of type 2 diabetes , and he does n't even have a sweet tooth			1
in fact , @entity0 ticked none of the normal risk - factor boxes , such as being overweight or having a waist of 37 in or more			1
so how did he become one of almost three million people in the @entity27 with type 2 ? his doctors believe the trigger was stress			1
in the 12 months before he began to feel unwell , he had witnessed his 19 - year - old daughter @entity32 being knocked over by a car and breaking her neck after a family meal out ; his thriving paint - spraying business had collapsed because of falling trade and teetered on the verge of bankruptcy , and his beloved bulldog died			2
then , in november 2010 , @entity0 unexpectedly lost his 70 - year - old father to cirrhosis of the liver			1
' that really hit me for six			0
he went into hospital and never came out , ' says @entity0 , who lives in @entity47			1
' he went downhill so quickly and i could n't believe it when he died			0
we were close and it hit me so badly			0
' within a week @entity0 started to feel ill himself			2
' i was suddenly needing to get up two or three times a night to have a pee			0
' i was also drinking around two pints of orange juice in one go , and i could n't wait to finish a meal so i could have a drink of water or orange juice as i felt so thirsty			0
' we were on a scuba - diving holiday in @entity61 at the time , but my wife @entity62 said : " as soon as we get home , i think you should get yourself to the doctor			0
" ' he dutifully did and the doctor decided to test him for diabetes			2
a blood test revealed that his sugar level was sky - high - 28 , when it should have been 7 at most			0
the doctor diagnosed type 2 diabetes			1
' i could n't understand why me , ' says @entity0			2
' i asked the doctor " what caused this ? " and he said " it could be the stress "			2
i thought about my year and realised that must be it			2
' stress is a known trigger for many conditions , from skin complaints such as psoriasis to irritable bowel syndrome			1
but increasingly studies suggest that it may also be linked to type 2 diabetes , no matter how healthy your lifestyle			1
he is now having @entity93 injections that increase the amount of insulin his body produces research published in the journal @entity99 last september found that those under extreme pressure at work were 45 per cent more likely to develop the condition than those under minimal pressure			0
the results were based on a 13 - year study of 5,000 men and women			2
type 2 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or becomes less sensitive to its effects			1
insulin acts like a key to allow sugar into cells and if , for example , someone is overweight that key works less well			0
one theory is that the stress hormone cortisol may also alter the body 's sensitivity to insulin			2
' stress leads to a rise in cortisol , a steroid hormone , and sometimes when you give individuals steroids ( drugs that resemble cortisol ) at a high dose , this impedes the action of insulin , ' says @entity134 , professor of medicine at the @entity136			2
' so when we do a risk score to see how likely someone is to develop type 2 diabetes , we do ask if they are on steroids , as this can increase their risk			1
' while professor @entity134 is not convinced that this means stress itself is a direct cause of diabetes , other experts believe it is			2
professor @entity154 , a psychologist and epidemiologist from @entity156 , says his research shows that people with type 2 diabetes react to stress differently - but whether this is what caused their diabetes or is a result of it , is not clear			1
in a study of 420 adults , his team found that those with type 2 took longer to recover from a stressful event - their blood pressure and heart rate took longer to return to normal than those without diabetes			1
the results were published in @entity174			0
' everyone responds to stress with an increase in pulse rate , blood pressure and release of stress hormones , ' says professor @entity154			0
but there was a difference in the length of this response between the healthy participants and those with type 2 - ' ninety minutes after a stress experience they still had n't returned to normal levels , unlike the healthy participants '			1
furthermore , professor @entity154 found that the type 2 diabetics had higher levels of cortisol			1
' it might be that they are more exposed to stress , or that they are in a state of high - level activation of the stress response			0
' @entity0 , with wife @entity62 , has also ensured his lifestyle is as straightforward and stress - free as possible next he plans to follow up healthy people in the study who also showed a prolonged response to stress , to see if they develop type 2			1
professor @entity154 says further research is needed , but adds that we may need to rethink the risk factors for type 2 diabetes and include stress among them			1
people with type 2 seem to think there is a strong correlation between stress and the onset of their condition			1
a survey of more than 500 patients for the online forum diabetes.co.uk found that 78 per cent believed their condition was brought on by , for example , stress in the workplace , long hours , the breakdown of a marriage or a family bereavement			0
often , adopting a healthy lifestyle is the first course of action for those newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , to help get their blood sugar back into normal range			1
but for @entity0 , who had no need to lose weight or get fitter , controlling his diabetes was initially harder			1
' it took a year to stabilise my blood sugar levels , ' he says			0
' they put me on metformin and other drugs but my blood sugar only went down a bit , so now i also have @entity93 injections that increase the amount of insulin my body produces - i inject it once in the morning and once at night , and that 's got my blood sugar down			0
' he has also ensured that his lifestyle is as straightforward and stress - free as possible			0
' i am enjoying life - thankfully my daughter recovered - and trying to avoid stress where i can			0
i have given up my business and sell log cabins in a garden centre now - it 's not a stressful job and suits me very well			0
' but what really annoys me is that people think you can only get type 2 if you are really unhealthy and have a huge beer belly			1
they insinuate that it 's somehow my fault and that i need to get off the sofa and stop eating so many doughnuts			0
' if i can get type 2 , anyone can			1
' other conditions linked to stress heart disease studies have suggested that stress can increase the chance of heart disease and of having a heart attack , and scientists are just starting to understand why			1
last year a study by @entity289 that assessed 29 doctors after a busy week in intensive care found their white blood cells count was high			2
other studies have suggested that white blood cells can rupture fatty deposits in the artery walls , which can lead to a heart attack			0
colds cold symptoms are caused by the immune system 's inflammatory response to the cold virus			0
the stress hormone cortisol temporarily dampens down this response so your cold symptoms are n't so obvious			0
however , if you 're chronically stressed you become less sensitive to cortisol , so the inflammatory response increases and you end up with a full - on cold , according to 2012 research reported in the journal @entity174			0
stress is a known trigger for skin complaints , gut disorders and colds gut disorders stress can alter the rate at which food and waste travel through the system , and change gut secretions			2
it can make the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome or indigestion worse			0
gord - gastro - intestinal reflux , when stomach contents rise back up the gullet - can also be triggered by stress			0
skin complaints stress is a known trigger for skin complaints such as psoriasis , eczema and acne , as it encourages inflammation which makes these conditions worse .			1

salesman @entity0 , 48 , from @entity47 , has type 2 diabetes
was diagnosed after a devastating year . doctors think trigger was stress
stress is a known trigger for many conditions , including psoriasis and @entity351
increasingly studies suggest that it may also be linked to type 2 diabetes
