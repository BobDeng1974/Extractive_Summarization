a member of the @entity2 fraternity has defended the disturbing @entity4 posts of unconscious female students that led to the fraternity 's suspension for a year			1
in an interview , the anonymous member of @entity9 described the group as ' satirical ' and accused the media of trying to ruin his fellow frat brothers ' lives and reputations			1
this came the same day that screenshots emerged of some of the @entity4 comments under posts made to a private group run by members of @entity9 , that included nude images of women , some of whom had passed out drunk			1
the screenshots show members of the group had commented referring to the women as ' sloots ' , saying ' i banged her lol ' , and then : ' @entity35 delete those or we will be on cnn in a week '			1
' ' make that 373,218 , ' came the response			0
there were 144 members of the invite - only @entity4 page			1
the anonymous group member provided a statement to @entity58 magazine and gave an extensive interview			2
he attempted to justify the existence of the group as ' satire ' , that ' everyone ' does it , and laid a lot of blame on the media , while calling for a return to ' higher standards of morality ' and referring to the incident as ' minor '			1
in his statement he accused the media of attempting to ' ruin people 's lives and unjustly ruin reputations ' and was challenged in the interview that posting pictures of nude , unconscious women or intimate messages could ruin their lives or their reputations			1
at no point was the @entity9 brother apologetic			2
nor did he seem to understand why police and the university administration were investigating the matter			0
' how would it do so when it 's kept within the entirely , well , it 's supposed to be an entirely private group of 144 people ? ' he responded			1
asked if that puts a lot of trust in 144 people when any one of them could repost a picture publicly , he said : ' but nobody except the one kid who snitched out this group did that … it just does n't work that way			1
' he added : ' it was n’t a legitimate concern			0
... it is a brotherhood and nobody expects anyone to go and post stuff publicly or so forth and so on			0
it 's a real disappointment that this kid went and did this			0
' asked if the fraternity should accept some of the blame he responded : ' i think people should be responsible for themselves , and , i mean , i obviously had nothing to do with any of these postings , but … just think , is it smart to post this on social media ? is this ethical in regards to the people who it involves ? ' ' but this is not a criminal thing			2
it 's not anyone else 's business , pretty much			0
it 's an inter-fraternity thing and that 's that , ' he added			0
he made clear that he had not posted any of the offensive material , nor commented on it , and that in retrospective , given the events , he regretted being part of the group			0
' it was a satirical group			2
it was n't malicious whatsoever			0
it was n't intended to hurt anyone			0
it was n't intended to demean anyone			0
it was an entirely satirical group and it was funny to some extent			2
' he likened the group to totalfratmove.com and ' raunchy ' @entity147 that ' people send all the time '			1
the group was known as ' 2.0 ' and was started approximately eight months ago after its predecessor ' @entity151 ' was shut down when a female student saw a topless photo of herself on a computer that had been left logged into the group			2
she was upset and threatened the fraternity who closed the group			2
members of @entity2 's @entity9 fraternity ( pictured ) posted photos to a @entity4 page that showed unconscious nude female students asked why the group was relaunched , the group member said that its primary use was for communication within the fraternity about community service and social events			1
police learned of the page when a former member of @entity9 , but still a member of the @entity4 group , came to them and began acting as an informant			1
in addition to the photos of unsuspecting victims , the group was also used for drug sales and hazing			0
the informant told police that the drugs included marijuana and edibles , concentrates , @entity192 medication and some cocaine			0
the informant provided multiple print outs to police and said when asked about one of the pictures : ' this is the type of stuff that happens at @entity9			1
' at a press conference on tuesday assistant police chief @entity200 said : ' the images are disturbing , i ’ll tell you that			2
i do n’t want to get into any more specifics			0
' police are working with the @entity207 and @entity2 's @entity208 , in their investigation			1
they are trying to get the fraternity to cooperate and help identify any members that posted photos as well as any of the victims			0
possible charges include invasion of privacy and harassment , though police are not ruling out other options			1
