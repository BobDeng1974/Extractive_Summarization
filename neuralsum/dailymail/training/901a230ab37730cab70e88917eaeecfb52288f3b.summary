by @entity0 published : 13:57 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 14:17 est , 13 november 2012 cardboard boxes left inches away from a wood - burning stove are being blamed as the cause of the @entity7 , @entity6 fire that left three children and their father dead on in the early hours of saturday morning			1
the fact that the family was only using the stove temporarily as they waited for loan approval to finance their purchase of a new furnace adds to the outrage over the situation			2

' i knew that from the previous owners there was a door there and i knew that if i opened the door i would be confronted by a wall of flames and i was afraid that i would n't be able to get out , so i did n't go in , ' mrs @entity61 said			0

once the sale was approved , they were planning on replacing the 46 - year - old hot water furnace , which explains their use of the wood stove with a propane heater			2
the @entity155 arrived home late friday night after an evening of family bowling and lit the stove in the first floor living room			1
