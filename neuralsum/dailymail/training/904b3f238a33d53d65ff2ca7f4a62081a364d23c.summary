the @entity15 government topped the list , requesting information on 21,000 users , while @entity19 asked for data on 4,144 users in second place , and @entity23 came in third with 2,337 requests			1
however , not all of these requests were granted ; @entity2 handed over information in only 79 per cent of @entity15 requests , half of @entity19 's requests and 69 per cent of the demands from the @entity23			1
country no. requests granted @entity15 21,000 79 per cent @entity19 4,144 50 per cent @entity23 2,337 69 per cent @entity34 2,068 37 per cent @entity35 1,598 39 per cent the report shows which countries requested information from @entity2 about its users , the number of requests received from each of those countries , the number of users / user accounts specified in those requests and the percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to disclose at least some data			1
these figures cover the period ending june 30			1
@entity2 plans to publish similar reports in the future and @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 already disclose government requests			1
the data requested falls into three categories - subscriber data , traffic data and use data			2
subscriber data , as defined by the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) 2000 , includes all data relating to a subscriber			2
' back in 2000 , that would have probably been a landline number , a home address and bank details , but because of the expansion of the internet , that 's changed considerably , ' explained @entity77 , director of privacy watchdog @entity78			0
' with @entity2 , this basically applies to everything within the person 's user profile			2
in my opinion , the law needs updating			0
' the second category - ' traffic data ' - relates to location of a user			0
approved authorities can request information from @entity2 including where a person was when they posted a message , where they ' checked - in ' on a certain day and confirming whether a pc or a mobile phone was used to access the site			1
this can be helpful when trying to find a missing person , for example			0
the third category relates to use			0
in terms of @entity2 , this refers to how you use the site - for example whose wall you post on , who you chat to in the in - built messenger service and who you send private messages to			2
the @entity15 government topped the list , requesting information on 21,000 users , while @entity19 asked for data on 4,144 users in second place , and @entity23 came in third with 2,337 requests			1
a @entity2 world graph of connections between its 500 million user base is pictured @entity127 , @entity2 general counsel said in the report : ' we have stringent processes in place to handle all government data requests			1
' we believe this process protects the data of the people who use our service , and requires governments to meet a very high legal bar with each individual request in order to receive any information about any of our users			2
' we fight many of these requests , pushing back when we find legal deficiencies and narrowing the scope of overly broad or vague requests			0
' when we are required to comply with a particular request , we frequently share only basic user information , such as name			0
the report shows which countries requested information from @entity2 about its users , the number of requests received from each of those countries , the number of users / user accounts specified in those requests and the percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to disclose at least some data ' we hope this report will be useful to our users in the ongoing debate about the proper standards for government requests for user information in official investigations			1
' the company added that ' the vast majority of these requests relate to criminal cases , such as robberies or kidnappings			0
in many of these cases , these government requests seek basic subscriber information , such as name and length of service			2
other requests may also seek ip address logs or actual account content			0
' mr @entity77 added : ' given recent debate about both the police â€™s ability to access data and the scale of surveillance being carried out by intelligence agencies , transparency is the only way to ensure that @entity199 can make an informed choice about new legislation and the public can have confidence powers are being used properly			0
