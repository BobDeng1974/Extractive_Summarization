@entity6 convinced hundreds of motorists that he would assist their appeals if they appeared , holding their ticket , in a picture with him			1
he collected more than 200 shots of bemused – but relieved – parking offenders during the two - and - a - half years he patrolled the streets of @entity15 and @entity16			1
pictured : @entity6 compiled more than 200 shots of bemused , but relieved , parking offenders and intended to compile the shots into a book - but has now been sacked by council contractor @entity20 in the photographs , the 35 - year - old warden can be seen smiling and giving a ‘ thumbs - up ’ alongside motorists and their tickets			1
mr @entity6 , who lives in a £ 250,000 two bedroom flat in @entity15 , intended to turn the pictures into a book but he has now been sacked by the council ’s contractor @entity20			1
he started taking pictures to defuse the tension when issuing fines			2
he said : ‘ there ’s always a whole different range of emotions when someone gets a parking ticket			2
‘ some laugh it off , some are angry and women would often be in floods of tears			2
there were attacks on other traffic wardens , but never on me			0
‘ lots of traffic wardens just walk off when someone asks why they ’ve got a ticket			0
that just puts people ’s backs up			0
but i was different – i ’d talk to people and tell them i could help them			0
’ mr @entity6 told motorists that he could not rescind their penalty but would back their appeal by making favourable notes in his pocketbook			1
all they had to do was to pose for a picture with their ticket			0
traffic warden : @entity6 convinced drivers in @entity15 and @entity16 ( pictured ) that he could assist appeals ‘ after that most people just relaxed			1
they were from all walks of life – doctors , builders , all sorts , ’ he said			0
‘ but i did n’t give them any concrete assurances			0
‘ being a traffic warden is all about having the right personality			0
the pictures were part of that , i guess			0
’ mr @entity6 claims that bosses at @entity20 had known for more than a year before they fired him that he was taking the photos and had banned him from using his official work camera			1

but i just carried on , using my own camera			0
‘ i think the pictures are fantastic – they ’re really funny			0
i showed some of my colleagues my pictures and they said i should put them in a book			2

’ @entity20 said mr @entity6 had been sacked partly for taking the pictures but also for ‘ other reasons ’			1

‘ appeals have to meet special criteria and the pictures would have had no effect			2
’ publishing the pictures in a book was a ‘ non-starter ’ , the firm said			2
‘ these photographs were taken in work time and remain the property of @entity20			1
