by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 16:02 est , 20 july 2013 when they are not strutting down the catwalk or on photoshoots in exotic locations , what do models do in their spare time ? if you believe the gossip columns , you might imagine the majority live it up at parties and on luxury yachts			2
but male model @entity12 proves there are exceptions			2
when he has his downtime , he likes nothing better than donning his overalls and indulging in his passion for @entity19			2
rock star crib : @entity12 and @entity21 - an in their kitchen which boasts tiles from a @entity26 station , cabinets made from @entity28 and a table which once belonged to @entity30 @entity12 , 39 – who has worked with @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 in a 20 - year career that has seen him modelling for @entity35 and @entity36 – has applied these handyman skills and a talent for spotting classic furniture to turn his bijou flat in @entity41 , @entity42 , into a retro palace			1
the fact that he and his partner , @entity45 , 32 , an art director at clothes store @entity47 , both trained at art college and obviously have aesthetic sensibilities helped transform the property			2
when they bought it in 2010 , it was a ‘ mouse - infested dump ’ , but the couple recognised the ex-council home ’s potential			1
it is on the third floor of @entity60 , a 1930s estate built to provide accommodation for auxiliary staff such as cleaners and engineers working at the @entity65			0
it was later acquired by the @entity67 of @entity68 to provide council housing			0
now about 40 per cent of the properties are privately owned			0
the flats surround a large well - tended communal garden , have off - street private parking for only £ 30 a year , and included in a modest service charge of £ 1,200 is a permanent supply of hot water			1
modelled by model : the bathroom follows the same retro - style with a cast - iron bathroom , recycled @entity26 tiles and the black - and white chequered theme @entity12 and @entity21 - an ’s flat has two bedrooms and is split over two floors			1
it has the advantage of a large balcony space			0
the couple paid £ 210,000 for it and have now put it on the market for £ 335,000 as they plan to move out of inner @entity42 to buy a bigger property to raise a family			1
@entity12 spent about £ 60,000 on the flat – meaning the couple will make a £ 65,000 profit – but this pales into insignificance when you consider the imagination , not to mention the hard graft , he has put in			1
his most eye - catching addition is the former @entity26 station tiling in the kitchen / diner and bathroom			1
the blue tiles in the kitchen once adorned the walls at @entity111 station , while the white ones are from northern line stations			1
but the work probably most far removed from his day job was laying the teak flooring , which he acquired on @entity117			0
‘ it ’s laid on tar so it was a very messy job , ’ he recalls			0
other retro items also found on @entity117 are a 1960s @entity123 wooden cabinet in the sitting room , glass bricks , a cast - iron bathtub , a @entity128 fridge , chunky cast - iron radiators and a kitchen table ‘ that once belonged to @entity30 ’			1
commons touch : the £ 335,000 two - bedroom flat is located in @entity41 's @entity60 , which was originally built to home staff working in @entity135 ‘ i bought it from an old manager of the @entity138			1
i had to go to @entity139 to pick it up			0
in fact possibly the hardest work involved was getting the stuff – i had to go all over the country , ’ says @entity12			0
perhaps the most interesting additions , however , are the kitchen cabinets , which have been crafted out of the fuselages of @entity28			1
‘ they come from a firm called @entity150 , but i bought them on @entity117			0
at the end of the war , @entity150 bought up a whole lot of planes no longer in use and turned them into cabinets			2
they come as units and fit together like @entity160			0
’ @entity12 has generously decided to leave his @entity117 acquisitions for the new owners			0
the couple will miss living in such a central location when they move – the flat is a short walk from @entity168 and @entity169 , while to the north , the @entity171 area is in the process of regeneration thanks to the imminent arrival of the @entity176			2
with his modelling career not as busy as it once was , @entity12 sees his future in property development			0
@entity180 , of @entity181 , @entity41 , said : ‘ the property has been converted to become an amazing space			1
‘ this reflects @entity41 , which has become one of the most interesting and vibrant of places to live south of the river			2
’ @entity181 , 020 7501 3666			0

ex-council flat in @entity41 , @entity42 converted into retro haven
it boasts tiles from the @entity26 and @entity30 's old kitchen table
also has cabinets made from @entity28 ' fuselages
two - bedroom home has been put on the market for £ 335,000
