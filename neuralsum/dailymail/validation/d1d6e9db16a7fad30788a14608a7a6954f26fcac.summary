a plum , which was ' accidentally created ' , has been touted as the next superfood to rival the acai berry			1
the @entity5 queen @entity3 contains some of the highest levels of antioxidants ever found in a fruit and has just gone on sale in the @entity10			1
according to studies the fruit has five to ten times more anthocyanins than a normal plum			1
the @entity5 queen @entity3 has five to ten times more of the antioxidant anthocyanins than a normal plum the superplum was created during a breeding programme for a disease - resistant version of the common plum anthocyanins provide the dark colours of many fruits and vegetables , such as blueberries and red peppers			1
research suggests that the plant antioxidants , which mop up harmful molecules , can help protect arteries and prevent the dna damage that leads to cancer			1
the plum was accidentally created during a breeding programme for a disease - resistant version of the common plum in @entity37 , @entity5			1
it is currently undergoing trials in studies with obese rats , and early results relating to the fruit 's potential to aid weight loss have been positive , reports say			1
rats were fed a diet high in fats and carbohydrates until they were obese			1
then a few drops of the plum juice was added to the rodent 's drinking water , which the rats consumed during their daily 30 minutes of exercise			1
the previously obese rats shed most of their excess weight in eight weeks			1
anthocyanins provide the dark colours of many fruits and vegetables , such as blueberries and red peppers			1
they have high levels of antioxidants which appeare to reduce inflammation and reduce the effects of arthritis in the body			2
the compounds in the antioxidants have similar effects as drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen			2
professor @entity77 , from @entity78 who led the research told the @entity80 that the results from the rodent - led research are enough to make a case for the plums health claims			2
' all the changes that rats experience with obesity - glucose levels , cardiovascular functions , inflammation - all those occur the same way in humans , ' prof @entity77 said , adding : ' the plums taste really nice			2
' @entity95 claims it is the first retailer in the @entity10 to stock the new variety of plum			1
@entity95 fruit technologist @entity98 said : ' this is one of the most exciting new fruits to hit the @entity10 in the last decade			1
' it is a win - win fruit			1
not only is it delicious but also incredibly healthy			2
it was created purely by chance and is an amazing discovery that could offer significant health benefits			1
' similar levels of anthocyanins in berries usually made them inedible , but the @entity110 @entity3 is incredibly sweet and a ' delicious addition to the fruit bowl ' with a ' delicious jammy taste - similar to that of a black fig ' , mr @entity98 continued but not everyone agrees with the positive claims			1
the plum can be consumed as a juice ( left ) or stewed and eaten with ice - cream for pudding ( right ) professor @entity122 , research director for nutrition and health at the @entity5 science agency @entity125 , said it was n't a clear - cut case			1
' it 's very good research and very interesting research , ' prof @entity122 said to the @entity80			2
' but when i last checked , humans and rodents were very different			2
you can feed rats an entire diet to test a hypothesis but that does n't mean you 'll get the same results in humans			2
' to make a claim that the consumption of a food will make a difference to people 's weight is a pretty long bow to cast , ' she continued			2
' unfortunately , this is something that happens a lot when it comes to promoting the health benefits of food			2
similar claims have been made by research on animals using everyday grape seeds			0
' mr @entity98 said : ' we 're constantly working with our growers around the world to develop new fruits and vegetables for our customers to try			0
' when our supplier came to us with the @entity165 we knew we had to get it on our shelves for consumers in the @entity10 to enjoy			1
' the plums are currently being grown for @entity95 in @entity5 , although the retailer said it hoped to grow them closer to the @entity10 in future			1
they have gone on sale for £ 3 for 400g , or two packs for £ 4			0
moringa best for : liver protection and blood sugar regulation most popular in powder form , this superfood is made from the leaf of the moringa ‘ miracle ' tree , native to @entity184 and @entity185 and one of the most nutrient - dense plants on the planet			0
it has been claimed that it boosts immunity , lowers blood pressure , alleviates stress , fights fatigue , improves digestive health and increases libido			0
and that 's just on the inside			0
it 's also a tonic for hair , nails and skin			0
so what makes moringa so miraculous ? it contains almost 25 per cent protein , including all nine of the essential amino acids , which are important for the body 's key functions and help maintain healthy skin cells			0
it is also packed with essential vitamins and minerals , including skin - supporting vitamins such as zinc , which includes strong , supple healthy skin , nails and hair among its beauty benefits			0
holistic nutritionist @entity223 advises : ' @entity176 has six times the antioxidant content of the popular superfood , goji berries			1
it contains over 90 nutrients , 46 antioxidants and abundant minerals			0
' @entity231 for gram , @entity176 contains more vitamin @entity232 than steak , more vitamin a than eggs , and more calcium than milk			0
' its antioxidants detox and protect the liver , boost immunity and support healthy blood sugar levels			0
' chlorella best for : liver detoxification and healthy protein delivery we ’ve all seen supermodels sipping on green juices containing chlorella this year but as @entity223 stresses , there ’s more to this trend than just a fad , especially when it comes to the morning after			0
the one to look out for , she says , is @entity254 , a green algae and superfood detoxifier , popular in @entity257			0
in 1996 , research from @entity259 , @entity257 , suggested that chlorella , a freshwater green algae , can lessen hangover symptoms by up to 96 per cent if taken before drinking			0
the idea is that the antioxidant - packed algae neutralises the free radicals ( chemicals that damage cells ) in alcohol			0
@entity269 - which also contains iron , folic acid and energy - boosting b vitamins - is also lauded for its gut - soothing properties , as it dissolves and expands to coat the stomach when eaten			0
mushrooms best for : adrenal recovery and digestion these are n’t the kind of fungi you ’ll find in the veg section of the supermarket			1
these medicinal mushrooms have powerful antioxidant properties that can help bring you back on track following a heavy night			0
one such example is chaga , a hard black fungus which has been central to folk medicine in northern climates for centuries and is dubbed the mushroom of immortality in @entity297			0
@entity223 said : ' chaga is a nutrient - rich medicinal mushroom , it grows on the birch tree and so harnesses the amazing nutrient properties of this tree			0
' @entity290 contains numerous b vitamins , flavonoids , minerals and enzymes			0
' it is also one of the world ’s densest sources of pantothenic acid , an essential nutrient needed by the adrenal glands as well as digestive organs			0
