students at the @entity4 are being told their guns are now welcome in the classroom thanks to a newly overturned state law surrounding the @entity9 movie theater shooting last month , but their dormitories are still off limits			1
complying with a state @entity15 ruling in march that overturned a 1994 ban on firearms on school campuses , reluctant school officials in @entity13 have compromised by providing off - campus housing strictly for those wishing to live with their guns			1
welcome back : a rule prohibiting weapons on the @entity4 , their @entity13 campus pictured , has been overturned for those students and faculty with concealed carry permits they say the students it would accommodate are a part of .6 per cent of the faculty , staff and students who have a concealed carry permit and that 96 per cent of incoming freshmen are already ineligible for the permit due to age			1
still , the weapons ’ welcome has left many unnerved			2
‘ yeah , it makes me very uncomfortable , sure , ' @entity43 , an @entity44 mother helping move in her freshmen daughter told @entity47 this week			0
' i definitely would not feel safe if they allowed guns on campus , in the halls			2
i would not be comfortable with that at all			0
' concern over the firearms ' permission also caused one university professor to threaten cancelling class if he learned any of his students were carrying a firearm inside			1
dorm ban : the university said that they will comply with the rule but not in on - campus dormitories , offering off - campus housing to those who wish to live with their firearms exceptions : concealed firearms will be permitted in all university buildings , with the exception of large , ticketed public events such as concerts and football games , their stadium pictured professor @entity77 's threat on tuesday was overturned by the university 's chancellor @entity78 who threatened disciplinary action to his faculty if any such action were taken , accusing them of being in violation of their contracts			1
' i believe we have taken reasonable steps to adhere to the ruling of the @entity91 , while balancing that with the priority of providing a safe environment for our students , faculty and staff , ' said mr @entity78 in a statement			1
mr @entity98 , a physics professor and chairman of the @entity100 , said he would stand by his own policy on classroom weapons and argued a student with a gun would be a classroom distraction			2
the permission of firearms comes amid a nationwide debate on gun control after a gunman who police identified as a former @entity4 graduate student killed 12 people when he opened fire at a suburban @entity9 movie theater last month			1
upset : one university professor told his students he would cancel class if he found out that one of his students had a weapon in his classroom , causing a warning by the school 's chancellor suspected gunman @entity125 , 24 , had been a neuroscience graduate student at the school and was living in a privately owned apartment off campus when the attack took place			1
law enforcement officers have maintained their right to carry weapons on the @entity135 campus			2
@entity4 officials said students with gun permits can request their relocation to the university - owned married and graduate student housing across two of the university 's four campuses , the obliging campuses being in @entity13 and @entity146			1
' obviously , our prime imperative is to provide a safe learning environment , ' university spokesman @entity147 said			0
' this balances the requirements of @entity135 law with that environment			0
' concealed firearms will be permitted in all university buildings , with the exception of large , ticketed public events such as concerts and football games			0
any visible guns , knives and explosives are still prohibited			0
close to home : the ruling comes amid july 's shooting at a movie theatre in @entity168 , @entity135 that killed 12 by an accused gunman who was a former @entity4 student @entity171 , spokesman with @entity172 , a nationwide organization of college students that advocates less - restrictive gun policies on campuses , said @entity135 's rule was largely positive , but it was still reviewing how the policy will be applied			1
' we want safety and security that goes beyond ( no firearms allowed ) stickers on doors and the goodwill of criminals to abide by them , ' @entity171 said			0
' @entity125 certainly did n't abide by the theater 's no firearms ban			2
' the university ’s vice chancellor for student affairs @entity188 told @entity47 that they concerned not of the students with concealed carry permits , but the weapons falling into the wrong hands			2
' we 're actually more concerned about someone who 's not experienced or trained in the use of a handgun getting access to one by accident or on purpose and possibly causing injury to themselves or others			0
' incoming freshman @entity204 from @entity205 told @entity47 he understands why guns wo n't be allowed in his dormitory , but also understands why others would want them			0
' especially with what happened in @entity168 a couple of weeks ago , and @entity210 , and all of the stuff that 's happened on college campuses now ... you never know what 's going to happen			0
