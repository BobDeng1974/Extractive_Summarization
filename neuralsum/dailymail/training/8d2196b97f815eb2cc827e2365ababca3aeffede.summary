churchgoers are to be urged to take a stand against gay marriage by the leader of @entity4 in @entity5 and @entity6			1
in a letter to be read from 2,500 pulpits during mass this sunday , the archbishop of @entity8 will warn that @entity13 ’s pledge to legalise homosexual marriage would threaten the true meaning of a sacred union			1
in a significant intervention in the gay marriage debate , the most reverend @entity17 will urge the country ’s five million @entity4 to sign petitions and lobby their mps about the changes			1
controversy : the letter by @entity26 ( left ) argues marriage between a man and a woman is at the ' foundation of our society '			1
@entity33 ( right ) said no one had the right to redefine the institution the letter warns that plans to extend marriage to same - sex couples would be a ‘ profoundly radical step ’ that reduces it to a vague commitment between two people			1
the letter says the roots of marriage lie in human nature and the pattern of complementarity and fertility in the union are affirmed by many other religious traditions			1
it argues that matrimony is an expression of ' our fundamental humanity ' and says : ' neither the @entity59 has the power to change this fundamental understanding of marriage itself			1
' it continues : ' its status in law is the prudent fruit of experience , for the good of the spouses and the good of the family			0
' in this way , society esteems the married couple as the source and guardians of the next generation			0
as an institution marriage is at the foundation of our society			1
' the text , which is co-signed by the rc archbishop of @entity84 , the most reverend @entity85 , argues that marriage between a man and a woman is at the ‘ foundation of our society ’			1
in an article for the @entity93 last month , @entity33 , the former archbishop of @entity91 , wrote : ‘ marriage precedes both the state and the church , and neither of these institutions have the right to redefine it in such a fundamental way			1
’ backing : the prime minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same - sex marriage the last time the leadership of the @entity4 used a pastoral letter to intervene on a political issue , during attempts to inflict quotas on faith schools in 2007 , the government climbed down within days			1
the letter is expected to have a more moderate tone than comments made at the weekend by @entity114 , leader of the @entity4 in @entity115 , who described gay marriage proposals as grotesque			1
@entity118 insisted that the reforms would shame the @entity120 in the eyes of the world			0
he said : ‘ since all the legal rights of marriage are already available to homosexual couples , it is clear this proposal is not about rights but rather is an attempt to redefine marriage at the behest of a small minority of activists			1
‘ if marriage can be redefined so that it no longer means a man and a woman but two men or two women , why stop there ? why not allow three men , or a woman and two men , to constitute a marriage , if they pledge their fidelity to one another ? ’ the prime minister is a strong supporter of plans to legalise same - sex marriage , which are also supported by the @entity149 , and are set to be formally unveiled later this month			2
but the proposal has divided the @entity151 and put mr @entity13 on a collision course with religious leaders			0
prime minister @entity13 ’s official spokesman said : ' the government has made clear its commitment to equality			0
' we believe people should have the option of civil marriage , irrespective of sexual orientation			2
' he also said that the timing of the consultation had been chosen to allow legislation to be taken through @entity167 before the general election planned for 2015			0
but he declined to speculate on the timetable for any @entity170 , telling reporters : ' we normally set out the timetable for legislation at the time of the @entity174 and we do it session by session			0
' we have purposefully set up this consultation with a timetable that would allow us to have that legislation in this @entity167			0
' reverend @entity17 ' letters warns that plans to extend marriage to same - sex couples would be a ' profoundly radical step ' deputy prime minister @entity186 told @entity188 ’s @entity187 : ' i think marriage is defined surely by two people who love each other and want to make a commitment to each other			2
' depriving same - sex couples of that public display in this day and age , i think most people think " come on , let ’s move with the times "			0
' civil partnerships were introduced for gay couples in 2005 but by law they can not be referred to as marriages			2
the clergymen are the latest to denounce the government ’s backing for marriage to include gay couples			1
in january , the @entity211 archbishop of @entity212 , dr @entity213 , insisted governments did not have the moral authority to redefine marriage			1
if the law is changed , @entity120 will become the seventh @entity219 country to recognise same - sex marriage , after the @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226			2
the @entity229 archbishops ’ letter also appears to challenge equalities minister @entity231 ’s remarks last week that the church does not ‘ own ’ marriage and that the state was entitled to make changes to the institution			2
‘ the reasons given by our government for wanting to change the definition of marriage are those of equality and discrimination , ’ the letter says			2
‘ but our present law does not discriminate unjustly when it requires both a man and a woman for marriage			0
it simply recognises and protects the distinctive nature of marriage			0
‘ changing the legal definition of marriage would be a profoundly radical step			0
its consequences should be taken seriously now			0
‘ there would be no recognition of the complementarity of male and female or that marriage is intended for the procreation and education of children			0
‘ the roots of the institution of marriage lie in our nature			0
this pattern is affirmed by many other religious traditions – understood as a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman			0
