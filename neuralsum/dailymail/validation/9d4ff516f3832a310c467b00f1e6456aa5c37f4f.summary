any mother who is charged with getting a young family ready in the morning knows exactly how physically demanding it can be			1
and it is a daily reality @entity5 - who is only eight - knows all too well			2
before @entity5 , from @entity6 , north @entity7 , even heads out to school in the morning she has to help to get three people dressed , as well as put on the wash and make breakfast for her family			1
the 37 - year - old , who is an ex-dancer , is registered disabled and suffers from a degenerative condition - scoliosis - which causes the spine to curve			2
the painful illness not only makes it difficult for her to walk but can leave her in agony			2
in addition , @entity16 has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder , which has seen her sectioned twice			2
@entity16 is separated from @entity5 's father @entity42 and has two other younger children , three - year - old @entity30 , who suffers from @entity44 ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ) and two - year - old @entity29 , who , more often than not , @entity5 is charged with taking care of			1
she told the mirror : ' i 've always done lots to help @entity51			0
she wakes me up in the morning around 7am - i 'm normally a bit tired , but i get myself dressed and then help @entity29 out of her cot , because we share a room			0
' @entity16 ( left ) says she feels guilty that she has to ask @entity5 to help with family life			1
@entity5 ( right ) can prepare family meals including pie and mash and spaghetti bolognese and knows how to use a knife safely an average day continues with @entity29 preparing ' @entity62 and milk ' for her little sister and making her mother a cup of tea			1
@entity5 adds : ' some mornings i 'll run @entity51 a bath			2
depending on how well she is , she can dress herself , but i help with things she finds hard , like putting on her socks and shoes			0
then , when we 've all got our bags and coats on , i go to school			0
' @entity5 's story is all too familiar			2
according to the charity @entity80 , there are currently estimated to be at least 180,000 carers under 18 in the @entity27			0
the organisation has launched a new website , @entity84 , specifically for children who are caring for siblings or grown ups			1
the charity adds that many children feel they ca n't share the burden of what 's happening at home , with up to 39 per cent of young carers not admitting to a teacher that they are looking after someone			1
another harrowing statistic is that children caring for others often face bullying , with 68 per cent of young carers saying they have faced name - calling at school			1
@entity5 is a dab hand in the kitchen but says she does n't feel like she 's missing out : ' the only time i feel a bit jealous of other kids is when i go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps ' for @entity5 , school offers some respite from the relentless routine at home			1
when the school bell rings in the afternoon , @entity5 can often find herself head of the kitchen , preparing family staples such as spaghetti bolognese and pie and mash			1
although @entity16 arranges for food shopping to be delivered , little @entity5 is no stranger to running errands and is a familiar face at the local shops			1
' i 'm used to shop assistants and customers looking surprised and asking me if i 'm by myself , ' smiles @entity5			2
' i just explain my @entity51 is outside waiting , and i make sure i get the right change			0
' other household chores include hoovering , separating our colours from whites and putting on a wash - load and doing the dishes ... tasks which leave mum @entity137 wracked with guilt			0
' i feel constantly guilty that @entity5 does so much for me and the other kids , ' says @entity16			1
' i should be looking after her			0
' @entity16 says the situation was made worse when she split with her partner @entity42 in 2014 , quickly plunging @entity5 into the role as key carer			1
@entity16 ( left ) separated from her partner @entity42 last year , leaving @entity5 ( centre ) a key ally in caring for her younger children @entity29 ( far left ) , now 2 and @entity30 , ( far right ) now 3 time for fun : @entity16 makes sure @entity5 ( above right ) is well supported			1
the eight - year - old is part of a local group for young carers and has access to a counsellor if she needs it ' she 's always been so grown up and capable			1
@entity42 and i decided to split up last year â€“ it 's not easy living with someone who 's bipolar			0
he 's a good father and the children see him all the time			0
' i do worry @entity5 will end up resenting me one day			1
i ask her if she wishes she was like her friends , but she just says , " this is my home , you 're my mum , why would i want anything else ? " i 'm lucky to have her			0
' in a bid to inject some fun into @entity5 's life , @entity16 ensures that her daughter is as well supported as she can be			1
she has support from counsellors and is a member of a young carer 's club which focuses on enabling @entity5 and other children in similar situations to kick back and have fun			2
so , does @entity5 worry that she 's missing out ? the resilient youngster seems to take her demanding role in her stride , saying only that she enjoys spending time with her friends and with her dad			2
she adds that all she 'd really like is to ' make mummy better '			0
' the only time i feel a bit jealous of other kids is when i go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps and biscuits while they watch tv			0
i wish i could have more play dates , but it 's hard for @entity51 to have extra children round			0
' ' i do like helping @entity51 , but i can get fed up sometimes when she keeps sending me up the stairs to fetch nappies or put clothes away			0
i 'll say , " i do n't want to " , and sometimes she 'll say , " it 's ok , i 'll leave it here and you can do it later			0
" ' ' i never wish i was anyone else			0
but if there is one thing in the world i could wish for , it would be to make @entity51 better			0
