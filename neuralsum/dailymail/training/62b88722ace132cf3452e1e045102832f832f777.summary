@entity0 became the second managerial casualty in the @entity2 when he was sacked as @entity4 head coach on monday night			1
former @entity6 manager @entity5 is set to be named the club 's new boss on @entity9 after he rejected the chance to join managerless @entity11			1
with things all change at the @entity4 , what type of player is likely to be targeted by the new manager in the january transfer window ? @entity18 and @entity6 manager @entity5 is set to be named the new @entity4 boss @entity0 was sacked as @entity4 's head coach on monday night after a dismal run of results what are @entity4 looking for ? anticipate a busy january transfer window			1
plans were already being put in place to bring in a number of players while also shifting some out			0
as many as four for four			0
@entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and @entity33 are available to clubs			0
chairman @entity35 has spoken of preferring a 22 - man squad , so there will be a balance struck			0
with @entity5 set to arrive there is likely to be even greater change			1
he will have his own clear ideas but @entity4 have prioritised a new , mobile striker and want pace in wide areas , on either flank			1
another full - back would be welcome too			0
@entity48 winger @entity47 is a player that @entity4 have shown an interest in and could be available for £ 3million , while @entity51 's @entity50 is a more expensive option			1
@entity51 wide man @entity50 has been touted as a potential target for the @entity4 @entity48 's @entity47 is a target for @entity4 and could be available for £ 3million how much do they have to spend ? prior to the change in head coach , @entity4 were primarily looking at loan deals , short - term fixes to boost the squad			1
january is a notoriously difficult month to find value and rarely have the club spent big			1
but @entity5 ’s arrival could change that			2
he is likely to be given cash to bring in players he feels will enhance @entity4 ’s chances of staving off relegation			2
given the cost of dropping to the @entity72 , that could be as much as £ 10m			0
@entity33 is one of four @entity4 players free to leave the club in the window @entity5 tried to sign @entity76 while in charge at @entity18 before midfielder moved to @entity79 what players @entity5 likes to buy @entity81 and @entity76 were the two players @entity5 wanted at @entity18 , only for each to move to @entity83 and @entity79 respectively			1
both are composed ball - players , so expect that theme to run through			0
@entity4 could do with a cultured @entity86 and a young centre - back as it happens			2
in his final summer at @entity6 , @entity5 brought in the likes of @entity90 and @entity91 – so a midfielder of stature could also be on his wanted list			2
@entity4 probably need more power to their game			2
@entity5 could be given as much as £ 10million to spend on new players in january @entity100 's goals have dried up with the 21 - year - old failing to find the target in his last 11 appearances hopes for the rest of the season … simple : stay up			1
that will rely mainly on their ability to improve their goalscoring			0
@entity4 have been pretty good defensively – apart from at set pieces , something @entity5 will look to remedy – keeping six clean sheets			1
but with @entity100 ’s goals drying up it is difficult to see where they win games			0
record signing @entity117 , who cost £ 9m , has proved woefully short of @entity2 level			0
finding a reliable centre - forward is paramount			0
@entity117 has only scored twice since moving to @entity4 in the summer for £ 9m			0

@entity0 was sacked as @entity4 head coach on monday night
@entity5 is set to take charge of the @entity126 club on @entity9
the @entity4 are preparing for a busy january transfer window
