' @entity1 should be brave enough to play at the international level by imposing its game on opponents and playing fast , ' the @entity47 said			2
' in the last two games unfortunately we were not able to play with the speed we were accustomed to			0
' forward @entity55 , who had spells in @entity57 at @entity58 and @entity59 , accepts it was a missed opportunity having seen @entity62 captain @entity61 dismissed on 38 minutes following two yellow cards as @entity1 could not find a finish past goalkeeper @entity65 despite plenty of positive build - up			2
