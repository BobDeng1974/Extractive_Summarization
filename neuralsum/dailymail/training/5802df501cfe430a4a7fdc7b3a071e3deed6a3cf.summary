by @entity0 anxiety : @entity2 , 52 , walked out in front of a lorry last year after she was told to ' move house ' because of the ' bedroom tax the brother of a woman who walked out in front of a lorry and killed herself because of ' bedroom tax ' has said she was n't willing to ' give somebody else a chance ' in a housing system that requires people to ' take turns '			1
grandmother @entity2 , 52 , walked across a motorway on may 4 last year after her local council allegedly told her she had to move out of her three - bedroom terrace house in @entity19 , @entity20 , because of the spare room subsidy			1
a coroner has today recorded a verdict of suicide saying the government 's housing policy had caused her ' considerable anxiety and stress '			1
but after the inquest , her brother , @entity29 - joined by ms @entity2 ’s sister , @entity33 - told reporters she ' was n’t prepared to give somebody else a chance ' of a larger home			1
he said : ' for social housing to work it needs for everybody to take a turn			2
' ' when you ’re adequately housed by successive governments , and your needs are met , you must give somebody else a turn			2
' it ’s terrible that people in this country are cramped into one and two - bedroom flats with children while other people sit on three - bedroom houses			1
' our thoughts go out to the lorry driver whose life has been blighted by this , and we just wanted to pass on our thoughts to him			2
' mr @entity29 also disputed the claim his sister had made about being given half an hour to ' make a decision ' on a house			1
he added : ' much has been written about " bedroom tax " pushing her - it was n’t , because prior to that she ’d attempted suicide before and that had n’t been reported before			1
' it might have been the catalyst to push her but was it just an excuse she was looking for ? - that ’s all i ’ve got to say			0
' during a hearing at @entity82 today , the @entity80 coroner , @entity79 , said : ' given the evidence of notes left of her intention , i am satisfied she intended to take her own life			0
' the case of ms @entity2 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , made headlines after son @entity91 , 28 , claimed that she had blamed the government ’s housing policy for death in a suicide note			1
the former postal worker , who lived alone in the three - bedroom terrace home , had agreed to go and see her gp the day before her death after her concerned daughter - in - law telephoned to make the appointment			1
' she informed me she had called her children in the early hours of may 3 2013 , saying she could n’t cope with the stress and wanted to end it all , ' the @entity98 said , in his statement to the coroner			0
dr @entity114 added : ' she expressed unhappiness at being pushed by the housing department to make a decision in half an hour , in reference to being made to move into a smaller property			1
' he added that ms @entity2 was ' happy to move but it was the way in which she was forced to make a decision ' which had caused her ' considerable anxiety and stress '			1
medical notes revealed ms @entity2 had been seeing both a neurologist and her gp since 1993 with ' stress and depression from her life circumstances ' , her doctor said			1
@entity142 , mr @entity79 said that in 2005 she took an overdose of anti-depressants over concern about her family			0
then in june 2010 , she was prescribed diazepam over a dispute with her neighbour after a fence was removed			0
today ’s inquest into ms @entity2 ’s death heard she had the option of a move from the three - bed address where she had lived for 20 years , to another a smaller property in @entity157 in @entity158			1
both her son and later her daughter had then moved out , leaving her alone			0
' she was still coming to terms about whether to move or have to pay extra to stay in her current property , ' said her gp , dr @entity114			0
he added that ' she felt she was n’t given the time to make her decision '			0
the @entity98 concluded she was ' not clinically depressed ' and ' had shown insight into her problems ' , agreeing to come back to see the doctor a few days later			0
however , he was later to learn she had taken her own life			0
reason : mr @entity29 added that ' bedroom tax ' may have been the catalyst that pushed her to walk in front of a lorry ( not pictured ) and questioned whether it was just the ' excuse she was looking for ' in notes left for family members , summarised by mr @entity79 , ms @entity2 had made clear her anxieties ' particularly in relation to the house move '			1
in one of the notes , addressed to her son @entity185 , 28 , she wrote : ' do n’t blame yourself for me ending my life			0
the only people to blame are the government			0
' mr @entity79 added : ' she also expressed the fact she did not blame her family and loved them very much but because of the housing changes she felt under considerable anxiety and stress			0
' a spokesman for @entity200 said there was ' never a requirement for ms @entity2 to move '			1
the council said houses were not imposed on people ; rather , householders selected from a council list of available properties , made bids on their choices , and in ms @entity2 ’s case she had been successful with two properties			2
' the last contact we had with ms @entity2 was that she wanted to talk about moving , ' the spokesman said			2
' it was never a situation where she would have been asked to make a decision in half an hour			2
' the council said ms @entity2 had also been eligible for a discretionary housing payment of £ 3,000 , a type of grant aimed at covering the costs of moving home			1
a spokesman for the @entity225 said : ' this is a tragic case and our sympathies are with mrs @entity2 ’s family			2
' the council was working closely and supporting mrs @entity2 with the changes			2
this includes offering advice on extra funding available through discretionary housing payments and giving priority help to move with a number of properties being identified for her			0
' there ’s often complex reasons as to why people commit suicide and we would n’t comment further on this			0
