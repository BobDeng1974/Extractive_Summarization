by @entity0 for @entity1 , a mother who thought little of climbing a tree or leap - frogging into the monkey pen during visits to the zoo was nothing out of the ordinary			1
and yet , her childhood , unusual though it was , was eclipsed by that of her mother , @entity11 housewife @entity10 , who was brought up not by a human family but by a troupe of monkeys			1
now @entity1 has spoken out ahead of a new @entity16 documentary that sheds further light on mrs @entity10 's extraordinary story and reveals what happened when she finally returned to the @entity21 jungle more than half a century later			1
@entity10 and @entity1 in front of mural in @entity24 , @entity21 - extraordinary : @entity10 ( pictured ) was raised in the @entity21 jungle by monkeys @entity10 's incredible tale began at the age of four when she was kidnapped and abandoned in the jungle by the unscrupulous gang that took her			1
terrified and alone , the little girl was discovered by a troupe of @entity34 monkeys who adopted her , teaching her how to feed herself , climb trees and escape from predators			2
by the time she was found , five years later , she could no longer communicate with humans and was living a wild mowgli - style existence			0
@entity10 back in the jungle at @entity44 nature reserve , @entity24 , @entity21 taking advantage of her vulnerability			2
mrs @entity10 was sold to a brothel in the northern city of @entity49 , where she was regularly beaten			1
after escaping , mrs @entity10 , who by then was calling herself @entity50 , met @entity11 - based scientist @entity51 and emigrated to the @entity52 where she has lived ever since			1
earlier this year , mrs @entity10 caused a furore when her incredible story came to light following the publication of her autobiography , the girl with no name			1
monkey business : despite having lived outside of the jungle for 50 years , @entity50 has some primate - style habits cool mum : @entity1 says she would n't change a thing about her mother - including her lingering fondness for climbing trees but for daughter @entity1 , the revelations came as no surprise whatsoever			1
' she did n't really have a moment where she sat down and told us , it just kind of naturally came out , ' she explains in an exclusive interview with @entity74			0
' during dinner parties , people would ask , and information would come out , and we would wait to hear more of her stories			0
growing up with her was an amazing experience			0
' and mrs @entity10 's monkey memories were n't confined to dinner table conversation			1
according to @entity1 , her mother still , at times , behaves as if she were still in the jungle			2
' we 've always known how mum is and it 's hard to believe she was raised normally , ' she adds			2
' she loves climbing trees and having fun and adventures			1
' she just has different priorities and she really struggles with lying			0
it 's all very practical so that kind of makes sense with her background			0
' and despite the passage of more than half - a - century since her jungle childhood , @entity1 says her mother has never lost her love for the @entity34 who raised her			1
' her passion and excitement for them has never died down , ' she explains			0
' but she has forgotten the language and a lot of the culture			0
' rather wonderfully , @entity1 also tells of her mother 's overwhelming excitement when confronted by the chance to see monkeys - even in a zoo			1
' we would go to @entity115 , and she would n't speak all day , ' remembers @entity1			2
' she 'd be planning to jump over the fence and her pockets would be full of fruit and feed			0
' friendly : @entity121 was raised by @entity34 monkeys , similar to this adorable mother and baby she would even display monkey - like behaviour with her children , and , according to @entity1 , would spend hours grooming them			1
' when we were growing up , it all seemed normal , including family grooming time when she would scratch our backs and pick through our hair , ' she reveals			0
a dramatic reconstrucion of a very young @entity50 in the jungle , filmed in @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 ' she would play with animals all the time , climb trees and you could see that she climbs in a different [ monkey style ] way			0
' unconventional though her own childhood might have been , @entity1 , who co-authored her mother 's autobiography , would n't change a second of it			2
' it was the best , ' she enthuses , adding : ' i would n't want to change anything - i definitely had a cool mum ! ' her perspective on life is really different : she never pities and she does n't judge			0
she raised us to be really strong and that 's a great way to grow up			0
' woman raised by @entity156 premieres next thursday , 12th december , at 9pm exclusively on the @entity157			0
