by @entity0 @entity1 is facing rising star @entity3 @entity2 in the quarter - finals of @entity6 today , and while the two tennis titans clash on court , their respective other halves were expected to be cheering them on in the stands			1
but while devoted @entity13 arrived at @entity14 looking chic and relatively cheerful ahead of what is sure to be a nail - biting game , there was no sign of @entity19 , who yesterday crashed out of the competition in a humiliating match against @entity22			1
while demure @entity13 has been a constant presence at @entity6 this year - as ever , immaculately blow - dried - @entity19 has yet to be seen in the stands			1
devoted @entity13 arrived at @entity6 alone today , while @entity2 's girlfriend @entity19 was a no - show @entity13 put on her own ' game face ' as she strode into the stadium to watch the quarter final in a bold pink sleeved dress sticking to a well - established formula @entity13 , 25 , wore a knee - length bright pink scoop necked dress by @entity36 , £ 440 , and the same @entity38 wedges she has been seen in every day of the competition so far			1
and of course she carried her loved @entity43 tote bag - which costs an eye - watering £ 1395 - as she walked into the stadium			0
while @entity13 kept up her unwavering support for her partner , @entity19 was noticeably absent			1
until now the @entity48 has naturally been more concerned with her own game than supporting boyfriend @entity2 , whom she has been dating since 2012			2
but yesterday saw the 27 - year - old suffer a humiliating shock defeat to @entity53 ninth seed @entity22 , ending her dreams of a @entity6 title , and she was expected to show support to @entity2 at the match today			1
as @entity13 took her place in the stands , her trademark blow - dried hair was shown off to its very best @entity13 has been a rock to @entity1 , supporting him from the stands - and reportedly cooking him dinner each evening @entity13 looked relaxed as she smiled and joked with friends , carrying her much loved £ 1,395 @entity67 tote @entity13 's hair looked as glossy and perfectly styled as it has on her other four visits to @entity6 @entity13 , who has been dating @entity1 for nine years , has attended all of his matches thus far in the championship while leaving the competition is no doubt a huge blow to the ambitious blonde , it has freed her up to watch boyfriend @entity2 in action			1
the pair began dating in 2012 , but only confirmed their relationship in 2013 after the @entity81 , and while she is known for a will of iron , she may find her hands are full with the 23 - year - old @entity3			0
his talent and good looks have seen @entity2 make something of a name for himself as a ladies ' man			0
he has previously dated @entity19 ’s on - court enemy , @entity92 - at 32 another older woman - and the relationship had a famously acrimonious end			0
@entity92 , who was defeated by @entity19 in the 2004 @entity6 final , has spoken out about @entity2 , giving an interview to a @entity99 magazine in which she described @entity19 as ‘ boring ’ and accused @entity2 of having a ‘ black heart ’			1
nevertheless , @entity19 seems smitten with the buff @entity3 and responded by pointing out that @entity92 was believed to be dating her married coach , @entity101			2
@entity19 and @entity2 have been dating since 2012 but she did not turn up to watch him on court today @entity19 yesterday lost on @entity103 against @entity22 the 6ft 2in blonde , who has previously said that she feels @entity2 's tennis is of a better standard than her own , was spotted supporting him in the stands as he won the @entity108 last month			1
while it 's unlikely @entity19 follows @entity13 ’s example and cooks for her man each evening of the tournament - being too busy working on her own game - @entity113 has credited his other half with helping his performance , saying : ‘ she ’s just been unbelievable supporting me throughout the year			2
’ now that she 's got a bit of spare time , the 27 - year - old plans to visit @entity121 , the pop - up sweet shop she has opened down the road from the @entity125			0
‘ i love going there , my favourite sweet is a liquorice with a marshmallow middle and strawberry flavour , ’ she gushed			0
it appears that when it comes to style @entity13 is taking inspiration from the @entity134			0
@entity1 's doting girlfriend arrived for @entity6 today in a pink knee - length dress that looked strangely familiar			1
the dress bore an uncanny resemblance to the @entity140 's frock that she wore to her visit to a primary school in @entity143 and @entity144 , @entity145 , yesterday			2
both dresses come from luxury brand @entity36 , the label that began as the go - to cashmere range for the fashion connoisseurs over ten years ago			0
but the similarities did n't end there			0
both dresses have a conservative shape , tucking neatly in at the waist and finishing just below the knee			0
@entity13 even opted for identical colours with both dresses coming in an eye - catching hot - pink colour			2
both @entity13 and @entity140 's dresses were finished with buckle detailing at the waist , but @entity13 kept to a slightly shorter sleeve for the hot summer weather			2
it appears that when it comes to the @entity168 nobody is immune !			0

@entity13 opted for a bold pink dress for her fifth time at @entity6
has watched all of @entity1 's matches so far
