officials have linked last night 's raid on a storeroom in @entity10 , north of @entity11 , to an @entity13 gang that specialises in such heists across @entity15			1
the theft was carried out by three men who tied up the lone security guard			1

stolen : a gang of thieves took these rhino heads from the @entity5 in @entity6 which have horns worth £ 427,000 store room : the heads had been moved from public display at the site near @entity11 because officials feared they may be stolen @entity30 , keeper at the @entity5 's natural history section , said the museum had never experienced such a theft before but had worried that the rhinos would be targeted			1

he said the eight horns could be worth a total of about £ 427,000 ( $ 650,000 ) on the black market based on their weight			2
three of the five species of rhinoceros in @entity54 and @entity55 have been hunted to the verge of extinction because their horns command exceptionally high prices for use in traditional @entity62 medicine chiefly in @entity63 and @entity64 , where the powdered horn is marketed as an aphrodisiac and even as a cure for cancer			2
the horns are made of keratin , a fibrous protein that is the building block for skin and hair , and has no documented medicinal value			0

valuable : the horns are made of keratin which has no documented medicinal value despite being highly prized in certain cultures @entity75 said the thieves - officially called the @entity88 but also dubbed the @entity89 by @entity11 tabloids - had already targeted museums , galleries , zoos , auction houses , antique dealers and private collections in @entity97 , continental @entity15 , the @entity98 and @entity99			1
in 2010 , @entity98 undercover agents arrested two members of the @entity80 gang trying to buy four black rhino horns in @entity104			0
they both received six - month prison sentences			0
@entity80 is considered the epicentre for @entity6 's @entity13 minority , known locally as travellers			0
they own most of the properties in the town , which regularly experiences huge influxes of @entity6 travellers from throughout @entity6 and @entity97 arriving in luxury vehicles for clan events			0
@entity6 police and @entity75 say the @entity80 criminal network also is involved in road - tarmac fraud and the sale of counterfeit goods , particularly tools and engine parts .			0
