by @entity0 published : 09:22 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 9 october 2013 beauty school may sound like something from @entity3 , but @entity4 has made it a reality for us non-professionals with their new @entity9			1
on sunday , @entity10 went bare - faced to a @entity11 at @entity12 in @entity13 to determine whether the average woman really needs to master the skills usually left to make - up artists			0
during the lesson , a team of beauty experts taught us invaluable skills for applying eye cream , concealer and foundation - and unlike your average beauty school , the whole course took just two hours			1
beauty school : on sunday , @entity10 went bare - faced to a @entity11 at @entity12 , where a team of beauty experts instructed us on the correct way to make - up the class - which had the added morning perk of free coffee and breakfast - is one of many that are being offered on sundays at @entity4 locations around the country - and it 's free if you sign up on the website as a ' @entity41 '			1
after pouring myself a coffee and grabbing a cereal bar , i took my seat at one of the four tables , which were set with clipboards , pens and various cosmetics tools			0
the beauty experts introduced themselves , asked us our biggest concerns when it comes to applying foundation and told us how the class would be structured			1
next , we were ushered to the cleansing station , where we wiped off any excess make - up or bacteria before picking out a foundation			2
to determine which foundation suits your skin , @entity4 uses a technology developed by @entity66 called @entity67 , a kind of camera that identifies exactly what skin tone you are			1
once you have your ' iq ' number , the machine tells you every product in the entire store that matches up with your skin			2
suits your skin : beauty experts helped me pick out the best moisturizer , eye cream ( both from @entity81 ) and foundation ( @entity82 by @entity83 ) for my complexion instruments : we had a choice of tools for applying foundation - a make - up brush , which is good for a ' buffing ' technique , or the @entity93 - a hot pink egg - shaped sponge i was recommended to use @entity95 , a liquid foundation by @entity83 with a golden undertone			1
after putting the foundation in my @entity4 basket , i was led over to the moisturizer station , where another expert figured out which moisturizer and eye cream i should be using based on my skin sensitivity and concerns			1
a helpful tip for applying the products came from beauty expert @entity109 , who told us to apply our eye cream first to give our eyes ' a chance to plumpen '			1
instead of rubbing it in with your forefingers though , she said we should use our ring fingers for the lightest amount of pressure , gently dabbing the cream under our eyes and up to the outside edge of our eyebrows			0
highlighting and contouring : i started , as i was told to , at the top of the ear , and brushed in a downward diagonal motion , stopping two inches below the outside edge of my eye the art of application : using a @entity132 ( pictured ) , i was given a fan - shaped brush to apply the contouring color we had a choice of tools for applying foundation - the # 55 brush , which is good for a ' buffing ' technique , or the @entity93 , a hot pink egg - shaped sponge			1
i chose the former , and started at the center of my face , as instructed , since that is where the most redness is			0
another useful tip i learned was to always keep my foundation brush clean and bacteria - free by wiping it with antibacterial soap after each use			0
@entity154 came the most anticipated part of the class - highlighting and contouring , a favorite technique among a-listers and fashionistas			0
using a @entity132 , i was given a fan - shaped brush to apply the contouring color first			2
make - up masters : @entity4 also offers classes on how to do a smoky eye , use colorful eye make - up , put on false eyelashes , transition from day to night eye make - up and learn about skincare new skill : the two - hour lesson - which ends with a certificate of completion - is one of many that are being offered at @entity4 locations around the city - and it 's free if you sign up on the website as a ' @entity41 ' i started , as i was told to , at the top of the ear , and brushed in a downward diagonal motion , stopping two inches below the outside edge of my eye			2
for highlighting , which is supposed to add radiance , i used another @entity82 product , dabbing it lightly on the top of my cheekbones and the tip of my nose			0
one of our beauty experts @entity197 gave us some memorable highlighting advice			1
he said to draw ' @entity200 ' around your eyes , starting under the eyebrows and ending below the eyes			0
and to top it all off , he recommended using a finishing spray to set the make - up in place and guarantee that it will last throughout the day			0
upon finishing the class , i was given a ' certificate of completion ' from the amazingly friendly @entity12 team , which i fully plan on hanging on my wall - as well as adding to my resume			0
@entity4 also offers classes on how to do a smoky eye , use colorful eye make - up , put on false eyelashes , transition from day to night eye make - up and learn about skincare .			2
