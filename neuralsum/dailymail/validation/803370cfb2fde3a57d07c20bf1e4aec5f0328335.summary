it 's an argument that has plagued most households at least once , but now the age - old question of whether toilet paper should sit under or over the roll has finally been solved			1
how ? by a 124 - year - old patent from 22 december 1891 which clearly illustrates an ' over ' arrangement for toilet paper			2
writer @entity8 discovered the toilet paper patent online , and wasted no time in sharing his new - found information with his 8,000 followers on @entity12			1
the in - depth patent created by @entity15 businessman @entity14 clearly shows an ' over ' arrangement the patent was created by the inventor of perforated toilet paper sheets , @entity15 business man @entity14			1
@entity14 , who was also the owner of the @entity20 , undoubtedly innovated the way toilet paper is created and used in this way			2
included in the patent , are @entity14 's declarations on his new product : ' be it known that i , @entity29 , of the city and county of @entity32 , and @entity33 , have invented certain new and useful improvements in @entity35			1
' although there 's no specific mention of the ' over ' arrangement of the toilet paper , the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use			2
and it 's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated ; it 's the state of the entire bathroom			0
other key things to consider ? @entity48			0
etiquette expert @entity50 said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit ' over ' , other bathroom tidiness is important : ‘ i very much judge a house , and the house owner , by the state of their guest bathroom			0
‘ i would question the hygiene of the person 's kitchen if the loo was n’t spotless upon arrival			0
finally , the age - old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved ‘ my own facilities for guests are half bathroom , half temple			1
‘ there ’s no streaky chrome , or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven - knows what germs to fester			0
‘ if a guest does n’t come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then i feel i have failed as a host ; so many over-worry about their food , spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack , tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint , when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the @entity87			0

the argument that usually *divides* households has been settled via @entity12
