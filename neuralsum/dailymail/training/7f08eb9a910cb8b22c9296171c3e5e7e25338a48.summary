christmas trees have become easier to decorate because they have fewer branches at the top - after two consecutive mild winters , growers claimed yesterday			1
many of the popular @entity7 trees grown in @entity8 have big gaps between their top branches because they have grown upwards too quickly in the unseasonal weather			1
experts say the perfect christmas tree should have around 9in to 15in gaps between its branches but two good growing seasons means the branches at the top of this year 's trees are very sparse			1
easier to decorate : grower @entity21 , 58 , harvests his @entity24 trees in @entity25 , @entity26 two mild winters : mr @entity21 said growers ' need colder winters to create the perfect christmas tree ' this year 's mild weather means the bottoms of the trees are also much more bushy than normal			1
@entity21 , 58 , who grows @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 at @entity37 in @entity25 , @entity26 , said growers ‘ need colder winters to create the perfect christmas tree ’			0
he added : ‘ we have had two long mild summers and a mild last winter , which means the trees have grown too fast and the distance between the rings of branches is bigger than usual			1

’ the milder weather also means the needles on the christmas tree are better than usual			2
mr @entity21 added : ‘ the foliage is the best i have ever seen			0
