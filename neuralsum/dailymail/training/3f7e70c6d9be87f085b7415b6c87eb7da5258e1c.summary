the striker is getting used to his new surroundings at @entity2 and says he is enjoying life under new manager @entity17			1
‘ people talk about footballers being motivated by money but i would like to look at it at the end of my career and put my finger on this point where i helped @entity2 get back to the @entity3			2
i will remember that more than what i was earning			0
‘ obviously the club paid a bit of money to get me here , so it is always nice for another club to want you that much			0
up for the challenge : @entity0 says he is motivated to get @entity2 back into the @entity3 ‘ with me and @entity7 our ambitions were going in different directions			1
‘ i felt as if my time was up there and i was lucky to have a club like @entity2 just coming down from the @entity3 who wanted me that much			2
’ there has been a huge turnover of players at @entity58 this summer with a lot of older players like @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 all leaving the club and @entity64 promoting players from the successful youth academy , and @entity0 has been impressed with what he has seen			1
always wanting more : the striker added : ‘ we have a lot of good kids , @entity68 is a special talent			2
‘ @entity74 has surprised me more than most because i did not really know much about him before i came here , but he is a fantastic little player , he ’ll play a big part during the season			0
‘ @entity78 ( @entity79 ) will score a few goals and then you have got the obvious like @entity82 , the captain , who has been around and is a good influence on everyone			0
’ special talent : @entity0 is impressed with @entity87 youngster @entity86 surprise package : @entity74 could play an important role for @entity2 this season @entity90 manager @entity17 is well known for his tough training techniques and putting the emphasis on fitness , but @entity0 has no complaints			1
he added : ‘ he is always trying to improve us			0
he is always on our backs to keep doing more , and if you feel you have no more to give he is trying to find another gear still so it is pretty good to have a manager motivating you that way			0
‘ everything has been about professionalism since i have been here , from the training , coming down for meals at the same time and everyone wearing the same gear so it is just professionalism			0
