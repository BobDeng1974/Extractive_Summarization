by @entity0 published : 19:35 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 09:17 est , 11 april 2013 no fringe benefits : @entity2 every now and then a tv presenter comes along who is so irritating that , instead of just switching off , you find yourself compelled to watch			1
over the years , i ’ve done this with @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			0
now there ’s a new contender raising my hackles : it ’s @entity2 , presenter of new @entity16 series @entity17			1
or , to be precise , it ’s her haircut			0
seemingly modelled on @entity20 from the @entity21 , @entity0 ’s trademark hairstyle is a long , heavy fringe that she ca n’t see out from			1
watching her squint at the camera through that curtain of hair is simply excruciating			0
and i ’m not alone in my irritation – @entity28 has been ablaze with comments			1
‘ i predict by end of series someone is going to take a pair of fabric scissors to ms @entity2 ’s fringe , ’ wrote one viewer			1
‘ trim it ! please ! anyone ? ’ another begged : ‘ @entity2 – cut your fringe ! ( does it bug the hell out of anyone else ? ! ) ’ and yet another wrote : ‘ @entity2 ’s fringe really annoys me			2
how does that woman see past all that hair ? ’ there ’s even a @entity28 account dedicated to @entity0 ’s fringe			2
@entity17 was viewed by an average audience of 2.57million on tuesday , up from the 2.56million who watched the first episode last week			0
but while it is wonderful to finally have a primetime presenter who is n’t an identikit vacuous blonde , i ’ve often wondered what horrors she may be seeking to hide beneath all that hair			2
since 2004 the fringe has grown about half a centimetre a year			2
at this rate it will be down to her nostrils by the time she hits 50			0
@entity0 , who ’s 41 , insists she wears her fringe long to hide the signs of ageing			2
‘ my forehead is covered in a 100 little lines and a fringe is the easiest way to cover them , ’ she once said			1
in the hairdressing industry a long fringe is often called ‘ poor man ’s @entity80 ’ since it covers a wrinkly forehead			1
but when you ’re a loaded tv presenter married to a successful film producer why settle for the poor man ’s version ? after all , as our photos below show ( created with a bit of computer trickery ) , it ’s hardly a flattering style , making the most glamorous women – from the @entity95 to @entity96 – look like old ladies peering for the number on the front of a bus			1
the @entity101 : @entity2 , pictured with the show 's judges may @entity102 , @entity103 , has irritated @entity16 viewers with her heavy fringe in addition to that hairdo @entity0 also likes to sport heavy eyeliner , pale lipstick and lashings of fake tan			1
the fringe , along with the squinting , slouching and stomping , is all part of the eccentric , bumbling act that she has perfected during her rise from late - night presenter on lesser - watched channels to mainstream host			1
her presenting style is a cross between @entity127 ’s posh ‘ golly gosh , goodie gumdrops ’ gushiness and @entity130 ’s self - deprecating clumsiness			0
she has a habit of standing with her toes turned in and holding her dress at the side like a five - year - old learning to curtsey , while the slightest thing makes her cover her mouth and collapse in fits of giggles			2
she regularly describes herself as lazy , hopeless , chaotic and disorganised and never misses an opportunity to say that tv presenting is easy peasy and that any idiot could do it			0
but the fact is that , as the daughter of former @entity148 editor @entity147 and publisher @entity149 , @entity0 , a privately educated @entity150 graduate , is anything but the ditzy clot she ’d have us believe			0
with two more episodes of the @entity17 to go , i know i will be tuning in			0
not because i care how their trouser suit challenge pans out , but because i ’m just hoping that one of the contestants will grab her scissors and do what the 2.5million people at home would love to do – cut that fringe off			0
a reason not to smile : @entity166 wrong recipe : @entity168 @entity169 - alike : @entity170 too dramatic : @entity171 not a clever look : @entity173 @entity175 error : @entity95 severe : @entity177 u-turn on this cut : @entity180 not worth it : @entity182 unfriendly : @entity96 catwalk ready ? @entity183 call the salon ! @entity130			0

presenter 's big fringe cause for irritation with viewers on @entity16 show
