@entity0 is thrilled with @entity2 's fine start to the @entity4 season , but insists it is just that - the beginning			1
the @entity6 have taken a five - point lead over @entity8 into the international break after sunday 's 2 - 0 win over @entity11 , their sixth victory from seven games			1
@entity14 are eight points behind , with the @entity16 and @entity18 nine adrift			0
@entity0 is thrilled with @entity2 's fine start to the @entity4 season , but insists it is still very early with @entity23 's history of claiming titles from the front , some are suggesting the @entity6 ' position is ominous for the rest of the division , but 31 games still remain			1
' clearly it ( the title race ) is not over , ' @entity0 said			2
' other teams have been in this position			0
it 's nice to have the lead but when you 're at the top everyone wants to shoot you down			2
' that 's the good thing about the @entity4 and why everyone loves it			1
' teams are out to get us because we are at the top and playing well			0
the @entity2 captain said @entity43 had been causing him constant problems in training ' the international break is here and we need to come back and maintain our form after that as well			2
it 's very important we do that			0
' @entity2 are chasing a first @entity4 title since 2010 - their only championship since two - time winner @entity23 's first spell ended in september 2007 - and @entity0 wants the @entity6 to ruthlessly exploit any slips by their rivals			1
he added : ' you 're just hoping when you 're at the top and have a five - point cushion and more on certain teams , a couple of them slip up again and that increases			2
' if that happens , it 's a lot of points to give up early on			0
all we can do is keep winning and wait for those teams to slip up			0
' @entity0 also took time to praise @entity70 , who has hit the ground running at his new club @entity2 finished four points behind champions @entity8 last term , but in @entity43 now have the ' killer ' striker @entity23 has craved			1
the @entity78 striker netted his ninth @entity4 goal on his seventh appearance , despite @entity23 insisting he is barely training as a result of a hamstring problem			1
@entity0 questioned where talk of @entity43 's fitness travails arose , insisting the Â£ 32million summer signing from @entity87 was causing him no end of problems in training			1
' i 'm not sure where that 's coming from , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity4 table - toppers beat @entity11 2 - 0 at @entity94 at the weekend ' he is n't showing that in training			1
he looks sharp , he looks angry , he looks aggressive			0
' he 's fit and that 's the main thing			0
@entity43 has been a nightmare for defenders			0
he popped up with another great finish			0
' a delightful pass from @entity70 set up @entity43 and the former @entity11 captain was praised by @entity0			1
' when it 's quiet and tight like that you need someone to open up the defence , ' the @entity6 skipper added			0
' he 's not only shown it against @entity11 but from day one			2

@entity2 beat @entity11 2 - 0 at @entity94
@entity23 's side five points clear at top of @entity4 table
@entity0 insists nothing has been won yet and they need to focus
