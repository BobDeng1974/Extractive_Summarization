by @entity1 reporter when it comes to the language of love , it 's not what you say , but how you say it			0
people make subtle changes in their voices when they speak to people they find attractive , say scientists			2
and these voice modulations make the speaker more attractive to the listener too , the research by @entity16 's @entity15 found			1
the men also reached a lower minimum voice pitch , or ' deep voice ' , compared with when they spoke to women they considered less attractive			1
luckily for them , female listeners found that style of speech more attractive too			2
lead researcher @entity43 said it is important for men to sound masculine , but that extreme masculinity can be associated with negative traits			0
he said : ' previous research has shown that humans signal their romantic interest in several different ways , including non-verbal behaviours and body language , like eye contact and casual touching , - for example playfully touching someone 's hair			0
' our study shows that people also modulate their voices to signal romantic interest and that this , in turn , seems to make the speaker seem more attractive			1
men were found to speak in a more ' sing - song ' voice similar to actor @entity34 ( pictured ) when speaking to women they found attractive ' for men , it is important to sound masculine , which is manifested in a deeper voice pitch			1
however , extreme masculinity is associated with negative traits in a partner , like a tendency for increased aggressiveness and promiscuity			0
' this puts men in a dilemma , because they have to convey two seemingly contradictory messages at the same time : " i am a masculine man " , and " i 'd be a good partner and father "			0
‘ the solution may be to vary their pitch – which would explain the sing - songy quality of the voices we observed in men speaking to attractive women			1
' the researchers ' findings also showed that by - standers respond to these subtle differences too			2
when the voice recording of a man speaking to an attractive woman was played to female listeners , the listeners found the voice more attractive than a recording of the same man speaking to a less attractive woman			1
the men whose voices were recorded were @entity30 and the bystanding female listeners were @entity109 - so the experiment was designed to ensure the women did not understand the words being spoken			1
this indicates the male speakers ' attractiveness was due to their subtle voice changes , rather than what they were saying			0
mr @entity43 said : ' if a woman perceives a man 's voice to be more sing - songy , then it is likely the man finds her attractive			1
however , these vocal modulations are very subtle and probably not produced consciously by the speaker			0
' additionally , while they help make a person sound more attractive to the opposite sex , people do not seem to be aware of why they find the voice more attractive			2
' the study , published in the journal @entity131 , added these subtle changes are probably not produced consciously by the speaker .			0

researchers found voice modulations make speaker attractive to listener
men were found to vary tone in a ' sing - song voice ' like actor @entity34 '
men reached lower minimum voice pitch speaking to ' less attractive ' women
