the new @entity1 diet , a nutritional plan created by two chefs in @entity4 that focuses on whole grains , foraged plants , fresh fish and meat , is being heralded as the next big trend in healthy eating			1
vogue writer @entity12 , who lost 4lbs in two weeks on the diet , says it is similar to the ‘ widely hailed @entity15 diet , which draws on the traditional cuisines of @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 ’ , but explains that it is more ' a way of thinking about eating ' – after all , the new @entity1 diet allows wine with dinner			1
' unlike the @entity15 diet , which allows white bread , pasta , and polenta , the @entity25 shuns refined grains and processed foods			2
and instead of olive oil , the @entity1 eat cold - pressed rapeseed oil , also known as canola , which has less saturated fat and more heart - healthy omega - 3s than its @entity15 cousin , ' she added			1
ms @entity12 used a cookbook from @entity59 and another by @entity4 food writer @entity70 to follow the plan , which involved consuming foraged plants , wild or pastured meats and aquatic foods , such as fish , shellfish and seaweed			2
a hunter friend donated several pounds of frozen moose to the cause			0
according to guidelines adopted by the @entity83 in 2005 , an ideal week of dinners includes three meat , two seafood , and two vegetarian dishes , plus unlimited root vegetables , leafy greens , nuts and berries , legumes , orchard fruits , and whole grains such as rye , spelt , oats , and barley			1
the new @entity1 diet is similar to last year 's craze , the @entity100 diet , which advocates eating like a caveman			1
however , @entity100 bans grains and alcohol and allows for more meat than its @entity107 counterpart			2
' three weeks into it , this @entity1 diet was going swimmingly			1
it had made me more conscious of health , not just food			0
not only was i drinking more water than usual , i had upped my exercise to two pilates classes a week , frequent five - mile runs , and the occasional hard - core cardio - workout video			0
i was sleeping better and enjoying a sense of satiety without too many cravings , ' she writes			0
she tried it : @entity124 writer @entity12 ( pictured ) lost 4lbs on the new @entity1 diet @entity127 story : chefs @entity53 and @entity55 pioneered the new @entity1 movement at their @entity58 restaurant @entity59 , starting in 2004 for more videos please go to @entity132 ' i cooked almost every meal at home : steel - cut oats with blueberries and maple syrup for breakfast , potato - leek soup for lunch , roasted root vegetables and steamed kale with currants and hazelnuts for vegetarian dinner			1
i made @entity70 ’s mussel - and - cod stew with vegetables and white wine on seafood days , and moose stew and roast free - range chicken on meat days			0
' however , when she realized she was n't losing weight , she consulted @entity157 , @entity158 , director of the @entity159 at the @entity160 , who advised her that any effective diet limits portions			0
when she began to eat more slowly and consume smaller portions of these @entity1 feasts , she was able to lose four pounds in two weeks			2
earlier this year , dr @entity164 led a study at @entity166 that asked 181 overweight adults to follow one of two different diets for six months			0
of this group , 68 people were assigned to an ' average @entity4 diet ' , comprised of the dishes currently most eaten in @entity4 , including many imported foods , and 113 were put on the @entity175 , with recipes created by @entity59 's mr @entity55 that featured ingredients made up of local and seasonal whole foods			0
all of the participants were encouraged to eat until they were fully satisfied , paying some attention to portion size , but never counting calories			0
results showed those in the @entity1 diet group lost around 10lbs on average compared with a loss of 3lbs for the @entity4 diet group .			1

the new @entity1 diet swaps olive oil for canola , and focuses on whole grains and root vegetables
