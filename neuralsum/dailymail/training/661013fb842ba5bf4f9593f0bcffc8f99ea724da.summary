' there were legal ways ...			1
. and there were illegal ways , ’ says @entity4 a private investigator jailed last year for paying a ‘ blagger ’ to steal bank details has revealed that his biggest clients were insurers at @entity10			1
@entity11 , a former @entity12 detective , is one of four ‘ rogue ’ private detectives whose clients form the basis of a secret list of 102 blue - chip companies and law firms held by the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
but in an interview with @entity23 , the 73 - year - old investigator has dropped a heavy hint as to who is on the list , saying he was employed by three international law firms based in the @entity28 , who in turn were working for underwriters on @entity10 ’s market			1
@entity33 : @entity11 , left , claims three international law firms could be among the 102 names on @entity19 's secret list			1
@entity37 , @entity38 @entity11 , who served three months of an eight - month sentence after being convicted last year , said the underwriters would regularly ask him directly , or through lawyers , to carry out ‘ financial investigations ’ to assess the value of individuals and companies			1
law firms who employed him included @entity48 , @entity49 ( now known as @entity49 ) and @entity50 in most cases , @entity11 says , the enquiries were ‘ entirely above board ’			1
a lawyer working for the firm representing phone hacking victims hired private detectives who used unlawful methods to obtain sensitive information			2
@entity61 was a partner and asset - tracing specialist at @entity63 , where he was praised for his ‘ aggressive approach to his cases ’			1
in 2006 he instructed a detective agency , @entity68 , to investigate the assets of businessman @entity70			0
@entity71 was acting for a firm that had given mr @entity70 a loan and wanted to check his financial position			0
unknown to mr @entity61 , @entity68 passed some of the work to ‘ enquiry agents ’ @entity78 and @entity79 who ‘ blagged ’ confidential information about mr @entity70			2
his bank account details were found at the couple ’s @entity82 later pleaded guilty to more than 50 charges of obtaining information contrary to the @entity86			0
mr @entity61 left @entity71 in 2011 and was replaced in effect by @entity88			0
there is no suggestion the firm , or mr @entity61 , was involved in , or aware of , any illegal activity			2
@entity71 cut ties with @entity68 after it emerged the @entity95 had acted unlawfully			0
last night miss @entity88 , who represented many of the hacked off victims , said : ‘ i have never worked on a fraud investigation			0
i have no knowledge of this case			0
’ but sometimes he sub-contracted work to @entity38 , identified in court as a ‘ blagger ’ , who obtained sensitive information illegally			2
@entity11 and @entity38 , 33 , were jailed last year following a @entity19 investigation and are at the heart of what is now known as the ‘ blue - chip ’ hacking scandal			1
the case prompted @entity19 to compile the secret list of names linked to the four private eyes but , despite protests from mps , it has so far refused to release it			1
@entity19 claims it might jeopardise current and future @entity12 investigations			1
the list was surrendered to @entity120 ’s @entity119 late last month , but only on the strict condition that it was kept under lock and key and not shown to the public			2
the agency said it has shared all its material with police , but @entity129 mp @entity128 claims below that argument was undermined when it was revealed that it only handed the list to @entity134 last tuesday night			1
the @entity12 said last night that @entity19 had been co-operating with them in handing over ‘ huge quantities of electronic data from the investigation ’			1
and a @entity19 spokesman said the @entity12 had been provided with full access to all material held by @entity19 , adding : ‘ the operation team involved in the preparation of the list requested that client information relating to their ongoing investigation be removed prior to its release to the committee			1
’ spears was jailed after admitting asking @entity38 to obtain personal data illegally			1
@entity38 declined to comment yesterday after retreating to @entity150 with his family			0
@entity11 said @entity38 could ‘ look at bank records ... and find out if there were any payments going through ’			1
he added : ‘ you rang someone who you knew could obtain financial information			0
how they obtained it , one never knew			0
there were legal ways of obtaining it , and there were illegal ways			1
’ @entity11 believes the three law firms he has named and the @entity10 ’s syndicate are on the list of names @entity19 compiled			1
the @entity23 put a series of questions to @entity10 ’s as well as the three law firms named by @entity11			1
@entity10 ’s said : ‘ we are not going to give you a response ’ , while @entity48 and @entity49 declined to comment			1
@entity50 said after undertaking investigations it had ‘ found nothing to support the allegations ’			1
investigations : @entity11 , jailed last year for his part in stealing bank details , claims he was regularly asked to carry out investigations for insurance institution @entity10 , pictured here comment : by @entity128 ; @entity129 mp and chairman of the @entity119 the @entity119 concluded its first report into private investigators exactly one year ago			1
it followed public anger at the activities of some @entity189 who had broken the law to provide services to their clients in the newspaper industry			2
at that stage , it was perceived to be a media problem , although it now has become apparent that it was much more widespread			0
the use of @entity189 who have been engaging in criminality with impunity was shockingly rife as confirmed by the categories of individuals , organisations and firms in the @entity19 ’s secret list			1
our report made several recommendations , principally the adoption of a regulatory system			0
it is normal practice that governments respond to @entity213 within three months , but there has been a surprising dragging of feet and a strange silence from ministers			0
this week i was pleased to see the home secretary at last announce her intention to bring in the regulation of @entity189			0
in his inquiry , @entity223 was asked to focus solely on the press			2
all major political parties have accepted his conclusions			0
the prime minister has reconfirmed his wish to extend the inquiry into a second part , primarily looking at the police			2
this can not go ahead until criminal proceedings have concluded			0
the time taken by @entity223 ’s inquiry , its limited scope and the delayed response fuels the need for an all - encompassing second inquiry			2
the focus should also be on all those that have used @entity189 , not just the press and police			0
it is remarkable that organisations and individuals , who operate in industries which can affect your freedom , review companies ’ accounts , or even appear in the pages of celebrity magazines , have been employing @entity189 who have been convicted of criminal activity			0
the clients involved are so diverse that this controversy has the potential to become even more serious than the examples shown in the first @entity263			0
following a formal request , @entity19 provided us with two lists of 102 names			1
in sending this information , @entity19 decided to classify it			2
extended scope : the time has come to start @entity223 part two and cast the net wider than the narrow remit of the press			0
above , lord justice @entity223 this prevented its publication			0
if we can not publish the lists , they will remain locked up gathering dust			0
the only way to test the reasoning behind keeping the lists confidential is by establishing the likelihood and timescale of any new investigations			0
i was therefore very surprised to have received in the past 24 hours a letter from @entity12 commander @entity290 informing me that @entity19 gave the lists to the @entity12 only 96 hours ago			2
in other words , @entity19 had not even handed the lists to the @entity12 until after we announced the publication of the categories on the list on wednesday last week			1
@entity19 has not acted with the urgency that this matter deserves			2
this is even more puzzling considering the joint statement released on july 12 by @entity19 and the @entity12 which stated that ‘ the ( @entity12 ) has been given full access to all material held by @entity19 ’			1
clearly this was not the case			0
it is amazing these lists were held by @entity19 without the police being told			1
@entity19 appears to have had the information on these lists for years and not acted upon it			2
@entity19 should review the classification on these documents and reconsider their objection to publication			2
in just nine weeks , @entity19 as a stand - alone organisation will be abolished and then form part of the new @entity313			1
this is an excellent opportunity to clear its in tray			0
more than this , we need to get on and start the process for @entity319 with an extended scope that goes beyond what the prime minister announced			0
without action now , there is a danger that matters will drag on for years , or worse still , be buried for good			0
that would be an affront to our democracy .			0
