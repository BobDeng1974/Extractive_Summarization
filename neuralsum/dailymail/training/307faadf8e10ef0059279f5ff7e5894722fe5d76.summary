by @entity1 reporter published : 01:09 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 01:19 est , 30 april 2012 the flight of a blind @entity4 activist to the @entity5 has sparked a diplomatic standoff between @entity8 diplomats and @entity4 officials , who suspect @entity10 is trying to undermine the @entity12 government			1
the flight of @entity14 , a campaigner for disabled rights and victims of forced abortions , is a challenge for @entity4 's authoritarian government and , if it 's confirmed he is in @entity8 custody , for @entity10 too			1
assistant secretary of state @entity21 began a hurried mission to @entity23 on sunday to smooth the way for annual talks involving his boss , @entity26 , treasury secretary @entity27 and scores of officials			0
concerns : fears are growing for @entity32 , left , who has been detained for her involvement in the plot to free @entity14 , from house arrest @entity14 's whereabouts have yet to be confirmed			1
activists in @entity4 and overseas have said @entity14 is either under @entity8 protection or in the @entity8 embassy			1
@entity14 's escape comes as the @entity4 leadership is already reeling , trying to heal divisions over the ousting of a powerful politician , @entity45 , and complete a once - a - decade transition to a new generation of leaders			1
as in @entity14 's case , the @entity8 is implicated : @entity45 's ouster was precipitated by the sudden flight of an aide to the @entity8 @entity53 in @entity54			1
while the aide , @entity55 , gave himself up to @entity4 authorities the incident and @entity14 's escape reaffirm long - held suspicions by @entity23 that the @entity8 wants to undermine the communist government			1
late last week , the @entity61 , in a reversal , said it was considering selling new warplanes to @entity63 – the democratic island @entity4 claims as a breakaway territory			0
it 's not known what @entity14 's intentions are : some say he wants to stay in @entity4			1
but negotiating any exit from @entity8 custody is likely to be difficult for the @entity73 administration			0
@entity23 is likely to be wary of any concessions , fearing they might embolden other activists			0
rounded up : activists fear for the safety of @entity14 's wife , @entity80 , pictured with the activist and their son without confirming if @entity14 is in @entity8 hands , @entity73 's counterterrorism adviser @entity83 said the president would work to further human rights while preserving ties with @entity23			1
' i think in all instances the president tries to balance our commitment to human rights , making sure that the people throughout the world have the ability to express themselves freely and openly , but also that we can continue to carry out our relationships with key countries overseas , ' @entity83 said on the @entity8 television news show @entity99			0
complicating any negotiations over @entity14 is the treatment of his family			2
while @entity14 escaped a week ago from @entity106 village and made it 370 miles northwest to @entity23 , his wife and 6 - year - old daughter were left behind			2
the whereabouts of several other relatives , including @entity14 's mother and brother , are unknown			2
though @entity14 – a self - taught legal activist described by friends and supporters as calm and charismatic – hardly seems a threat , security forces and officials have reacted angrily , detaining several of his supporters and a nephew who fought with officials after the escape was discovered is on the run			1
retribution : several members of @entity14 's family are believed to have been detained following his escape police showed up at the home of veteran activists @entity129 and @entity130 , who met with @entity14 last week while he was hiding in @entity23			1
police took @entity130 away saturday for 24 hours			0
they questioned @entity129 for about a half - hour at home , sounding , she said , ' very unhappy ' about @entity14 's flight			2
' they were really irritated , ' @entity129 said			0
' it was a big shock for them			0
' concern is growing for the safety of a courageous @entity4 activist who was detained after helping a blind dissident escape house arrest			2
human rights campaigners believe @entity32 was arrested for her involvement in the plot which freed legal activist @entity14 , 40 , who had been in captivity for almost six years			1
@entity32 , from @entity146 , had been at the forefront of the campaign to free @entity14 , a self - taught ' barefoot lawyer ' who was jailed for four years and then held for 19 months under heavy guard after exposing forced abortions as part of @entity4 's one - child policy			1
she claimed she had driven @entity14 to a ' relatively safe place ' after he dodged more than 100 guards and broke loose from @entity106 village , in @entity4 's @entity159 province , southeast of @entity23			2
@entity14 was then driven 350 miles through the countryside to the @entity8 embassy			1
secret meeting : blind legal activist @entity14 has spoken to fellow @entity4 dissident @entity130 at an undisclosed location in @entity23 @entity166 , of @entity167 - based human rights group @entity165 , is reported to have spoken to @entity32 on friday , but she hung up when she told him ' public security ' was at the door			1
friends have been unable to contact her since then and her phone was switched off on friday evening			0
police in @entity146 said they knew nothing of the case			0
high - level talks : the top @entity8 diplomat for @entity180 , @entity21 arrived at a hotel in @entity23 to discuss the case one user on @entity184 's microblog service compared @entity32 to @entity185 ' bravely going to dangerous places '			2
the message continued : ' she has been beaten and insulted in [ @entity106 ]			0
' she keeps her faith and courage			0
' activists now fear for the safety of @entity14 's wife , @entity80 , his six - year - old daughter , his elderly mother and other family members who they believe have been rounded up in retribution			1
his nephew , @entity198 , was said to be in hiding after using a kitchen knife to defend his mother from intruders			0
another activist , @entity202 , is also believed to have been detained			0
@entity203 , a rights lawyer who tried to represent @entity14 in his court case , told @entity205 that state security had questioned him on friday			0
@entity207 , of @entity208 , said : ' it has been extraordinary – this is high stakes stuff			0
' none of these people will have gone into it without a pretty clear idea of what might happen to them as a result			0
' that shows extraordinary courage on the part of activists who are extremely vulnerable to exactly these kinds of reprisals … in my view , the least other governments can do is stand with them			0
' the @entity8 has declined to comment on @entity14 's whereabouts , but a photograph has emerged of him meeting fellow @entity4 dissident @entity130 at an undisclosed location in @entity23			1
@entity165 has issued a statement claiming it ' learned from a source close to the @entity14 situation that @entity14 is under @entity8 protection '			2
the group said ' high - level talks ' were under way between @entity8 and @entity4 officials regarding @entity14 's ' status '			1
anger : the activist 's detention for exposing forced abortions in @entity4 caused international outcry the claims could overshadow a two - day meeting with top @entity73 administration officials , including secretary of state @entity26 , in @entity23 from thursday , and ignite new tensions between the two governments			1
the top @entity8 diplomat for @entity180 , @entity21 was seen arriving at a hotel in @entity23 , to discuss the case			0
mr @entity166 said : ' because of @entity14 's wide popularity , the @entity253 must stand firmly with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the rule of law			2
' the reports of @entity14 's escape come nearly three months after a @entity4 official @entity55 fled into a @entity8 consulate for over 24 hours on february 6 , unleashing a scandal that has rattled the ruling @entity264 months before a once - in - a - decade leadership handover			1
@entity55 's brief flight to the @entity8 consulate led to the downfall of top official @entity45 who had been openly campaigning for a place in the inner circle of power in @entity23			2
surrounded : visitors trying to see @entity14 , including @entity271 , have been forcibly removed from the village by over-zealous @entity4 guards @entity274 , a @entity23 lawyer and rights advocate , said reliable contacts also told him @entity14 took refuge in @entity8 embassy grounds			1
he said : ' everyone knew about the suffering of @entity14 and his family but nobody dared raised his head over this and ignored it			2
' @entity14 has been the most typical victim of this lawless , boundless exercise of power			0
but the day has finally come when he has escaped from it			0
' @entity14 angered authorities in 2005 by exposing forced abortion in his own village and others nearby as part of @entity4 's one - child policy			1
he was jailed soon after on a charge of ' blocking traffic ' and damaging property in a protest , and has been held under house arrested ever since his release in september 2010			0
lawyers and activists attempted to visit @entity14 in him home ever since have been forcibly denied entry to his village by guards , while the man himself compared his own home to a ' prison ' due to his plight			0
it is thought the @entity4 authorities had no legal grounds for detaining him , and guards even scuffled with @entity315 star @entity271 when the @entity317 actor tried to visit @entity14 in his home .			2

@entity32 was arrested for helping @entity14 flee to the @entity8 embassy , campaigners believe
members of @entity14 's family thought to have been rounded up in retribution
