@entity20 case : a jury has awarded about $ 638,000 to a woman who sued a man for allegedly having a sadomasochistic sexual relationship with her handicapped adult daughter according to court documents , the relationship included @entity8 dragging @entity4 by a leash and dog collar , slapping her with his hand and a belt , pinching and twisting body parts , tying and gagging her and dripping burning hot wax on her			1
@entity8 said @entity34 , whom he met online , was able to consent			0
prosecutors refused to charge him , but @entity4 sued in 2006			1
she claimed that a court had ruled @entity37 incapable of making decisions for herself and that she could not consent to any sex - much less the kind of relationship she had with @entity8			2
a jury found in his favor in 2009 , but the state @entity45 overturned the verdict this june			1
the latest trial resulted in a new @entity50 jury finding in favor of @entity4 on thursday			1
@entity4 's daughter , known as @entity37 , died in 2010 at age 39 from an undisclosed illness			2
she was diagnosed with clinical depression , borderline personality disorder , bulimia and anorexia , and she twice tried to commit suicide , according to court documents			0
she also in 2001 had a stroke that left her partially paralyzed from the waist down			0
commenting on thursday 's outcome , @entity4 's lawyer , @entity63 , said : ' we finally got justice for @entity37 and obviously for her mother			1
' this case is important because it sends a message ... to men who prey on women			0
' people who do the kinds of things @entity8 did have to be made to answer to it , and the community needs to express outrage			0
' @entity8 did n't return a phone message tuesday			0
his lawyer , @entity79 , said he plans to ask the trial judge to overturn the verdict or lower the award and then , based on the judge 's rulings , consider appealing the verdict to a higher state court			2
' we were somewhat puzzled and disappointed by the outcome , ' @entity79 said			0
' @entity8 's a great guy			0
unfortunately , like many things that become media sensations , he 'll be pilloried before his side gets told			0
' a probate court ruled in 1994 that @entity37 could n't manage her own affairs and appointed her mother as her conservator			2
in @entity4 's appeal of the first jury verdict , the state @entity45 ruled that people do n't necessarily give up their ability to consent to sex , including sadomasochistic encounters , when they are placed under the legal conservatorship of others			1
appeal : @entity108 's mother @entity107 brought the case to the @entity45 after a jury found that the sex was consensual the court also said it is up to juries to decide if people are able to consent to sex			1
while sadomasochism was glamorized in the popular book trilogy @entity117 , the practice has long been on questionable legal ground			0
some lawyers believe people ca n't consent to being assaulted or abused under common law , while others say established legal principles provide sexual rights to most people , including the elderly in nursing homes and the mentally ill. the @entity45 ordered a new trial because a letter @entity37 purportedly wrote in 2003 about unwanted sexual advances by another man was mistakenly given to the jury for deliberations despite not having been properly admitted into evidence			1
lawyers in the case had said they could n't recall any legal precedents in the country on whether mentally ill people can consent to sex or sadomasochism .			0
