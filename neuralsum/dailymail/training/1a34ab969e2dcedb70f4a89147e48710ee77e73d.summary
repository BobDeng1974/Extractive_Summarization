by @entity0 if you 're over 30 and asked how many sex partners to confess to , the correct answer is ten			1
the reason i know the answer to that question is because every female i know ( barring those who married their childhood sweethearts ) answers ' ten ' whenever they 're asked by a partner how many people they 've slept with			2
@entity0 says that no matter how many people you have slept with , the number will always be too high for a man the answer stays the same even when they 're a decade older and had several long - term relationships in the meantime			1
this is two more than the national ' official ' figure			0
the average number of sexual partners in the ' average ' woman 's lifetime is eight , according to @entity28 in @entity29			1
the average for men is 12 partners			1
an average tells us nothing in this instance - researchers lump in @entity38 who has n't had sex for 50 years with @entity41 , an 18 - year - old , eagerly exploring sex for the first time , average out all the results and then call her the ' average woman '			0
quite apart from how ridiculous that is , i do n't think it 's a question anyone should answer anyway.the reason why is this : numbers mean nothing without knowing the circumstances			0
@entity0 says that the number of people you have slept with has no reflection on how promiscuous you are reducing your sexual history to a number does n't work			1
i interviewed three women a few years back for one of the books i was writing			1
all were around @entity64 first had slept with 26 men , the second four and the third eight			0
no prizes for guessing which girl would be judged the harshest by a partner			1
but was she really the most promiscuous ? here 's some more information : the girl who 's had 26 lovers , has averaged around two lovers a year since she was 17 and been mainly single			2
the girl who 'd slept with eight men , put four of those notches in the bedpost during one resort holiday ( a weekend actually ) while her then - husband stayed home and looked after the kids			0
the girl who slept with four had a threesome with two guys she met in a club			0
outside , in a nearby alley			0
she was 18 and a self - proclaimed wild child at the time			0
now what do you think ? people will judge you no matter what answer you give when asked about past lovers and the assumption they make is usually wrong			2
which is why i do n't care who 's doing the asking – whether it 's your partner , mother , best friend or beauty therapist - your answer to how many lovers you 've had is no answer			2
( the only exceptions : your psychotherapist , gynaecologist or the nice people at the @entity112 clinic who are testing you for @entity113 )			0
keep your mouth zipped even if nothing else has been : by putting a number on your sexual history you 're removing the emotion and the circumstances			1
and do n't kid yourself : if you do blurt out a figure to your boyfriend , you will be judged – and not necessarily by the same rules he judges himself on			2
even if he 's slept with 300 , your three will be two too many			0
after all , is n't the definition of a promiscuous person , someone who 's slept with more than you have ? for more of @entity0 's views on sex and relationships , check out @entity132			1
