she is the daughter of one of the most notorious dictators in the world , and a woman who has openly pledged her support for @entity6			1
but that does n't mean @entity8 does n't have an eye for design , as she hopes to prove with her new jewellery range - complete with pieces unshamedly inspired by her despot father , as well as the husband he had murdered			1
sold in one of @entity18 's finest jewellery stores , the rings , bracelets and necklaces even feature a £ 1,000 pendent in the shape of @entity24 , @entity15 can reveal			1
exactly why the 46 - year - old - known as ' @entity25 ' , for her similarities to her father - has decided to move into the jewellery business is unclear			2
but the boastful interview , in a @entity18 sales brochure , has emerged as new controversy rages over the delaying of the @entity33 in @entity34			0
she said : ' my dad @entity36 gave me this turquoise many years ago and i kept it safe until three years ago ' @entity45 explains : ' @entity55 is the heart of @entity24			1
i chose to place a diamond in its place and you can chose to change the location of the stone ' the publication of the @entity63 has been delayed until after the @entity34 general election in may after those criticised were given the opportunity to respond			0
among the 10 - piece collection is a £ 1,320 turquoise bracelet designed to match one she created from a gift @entity36 had given her			1
' my dad @entity36 gave me this turquoise many years ago and i kept it safe until three years ago , ' revealed @entity45 in a sales brochure for her wares			1
' i chose to place it in this bracelet and create a similar design for those who like this design and want to keep it			0
' and , if the jewellery is an insight into what @entity45 values , then there is one other piece which seems to have special significance : a pendant in the shape of @entity24			1
' @entity55 is the heart of @entity24			1
i chose to place a diamond in its place , ' she revealed			0
also among the collection - on sale at an exclusive jewellers in @entity96 , @entity18 , her home since the end of the @entity99 - is a pair of earrings @entity45 created , originally , for her daughters from a ring her late husband @entity104 gave her			2
she said : ' i designed this earing for one of my daughters , and it was taken from a ring that my late husband @entity36 gave me long time ago			1
i decided to change to from a ring to an earring and then i created this design for those who like its shape			0
' the fact both men are included in this rather nostalgic collection is an odd decision			2
after all , @entity36 had @entity36 killed back in 1996 , having promised his son - in - law forgiveness on his return to @entity24 after he defected to @entity18 in 1995			1
@entity45 had divorced him days before ; it is said he has been edited out of family pictures			0
but this is one of many contradictions in @entity45 's life			2
@entity45 modelled this pair of earrings on a pair she had made for her daughter , using a ring she was given by her late husband @entity104 ( pictured with @entity45 , left ) - a man her father had killed despite the fact @entity36 had her husband killed , @entity45 ( pictured here as a young girl with her father ) found it in herself to forgive him @entity45 is @entity36 's oldest daughter			1
by the time she was ten years old , @entity36 was president of @entity24 - a position he would hold until she was forced to flee in 2003			1
@entity45 - who is said to be an avid reader of @entity143 - had her first child , a boy named @entity145 , by the age of 16 , having married @entity36 , then supervisor of @entity36 's @entity148 , in 1983			1
by the age of 26 , she had had four more : boys @entity36 and @entity151 , and girls @entity152 and @entity154			1
she is , by all accounts , a woman used to the finer things in life : her extravagent lifestyle while living in @entity18 has raised some eyebrows			2
her love of designer labels is legendary : she is said to pay for @entity164 handbags and £ 400 @entity166 boots with a thick wads of crisp @entity169 dollars			2
a falcon ring , to represent ' simple of strength and beauty ' , and a ' special ring , to be given to the best the most precious people in our lives ' a snake bracelet in gold and silver and @entity45 's favourite piece as ' it was done as a model for my work '			0
the letter l , she explains , can be changed upon request flower - inspired bracelets in white and blue will mkae a pretty gift , while the simple rectangular pendant is designed to be given to a loved one and engraved appropriately ' she buys shoes by the sack load , ' a woman close to @entity45 's tight circle of friends told the @entity196 in 2006			1
but it is not just her clothes @entity45 likes to spend money on : she is also famous for her love of plastic surgery , and is said to have had extensive work done with one of the top surgeons in @entity18			1
her daily regime - during which she is chauffeured around - is said to include a trip to the gym , beauty parlour and , of course , the shops			0
indeed , when the news of her father 's failed appeal , and imminent execution reached her , she was apparently sat in an @entity96 beauty parlour awaiting a hot stone beauty scrub			2
however , exactly where this money comes from is not known			0
some in @entity18 - where she has lived as a ' guest ' of the royal family since leaving @entity24 - believe she is being funded by her hosts , much to their annoyance			2
@entity36 and his family : @entity45 is pictured third right , next to her brother @entity225 ( centre )			2
he and @entity228 ( far right ) were both killed in 2003 , before @entity45 fled with her family to @entity18 @entity36 with @entity45 's oldest son @entity145 , when he was aged two			1
@entity45 has raised her children to respect the memory of their grandfather but recently , it is a more devout image she has been keen to portray to the wider world			0
for @entity45 has seen a way back to her beloved @entity24 - and that way is @entity6 , despite the fact she is far from the extremist group 's idea of an ideal woman			1
veterans of @entity36 's @entity244 party are said to see the militants as allies of sorts , and @entity45 would very much like to follow in her father 's footsteps			1
baathists have even been helping @entity6 take control of towns in northern @entity24			1
she expressed delight after militants captured @entity255 , her father ’s hometown , last year , telling @entity18 newspaper @entity257 : ' these are victories of my father ’s fighters and my uncle @entity262			0
' it is n't the first time @entity45 has been linked to terrorism			0
in 2010 , @entity266 issued an arrest warrant , accusing her of funding terrorism in her native @entity24			1
@entity45 has been vocal in her support of @entity6 , speaking to a @entity18 newspaper of her ' delight ' when the militants took @entity36 's home town of @entity255 she was also ranked number 16 on the @entity169 's most - wanted list in 2007 , while her mother was number 17			1
both times , the @entity18 royal family refused to give her up			0
and while she may not practice the overt violence her two older brothers , @entity225 and @entity282 , would become known , @entity45 is known for her sharp tongue			0
' the store owners are wary of her because she can be a difficult customer and nothing is ever good enough for her , ' the @entity196 's source said in 2006			0
' there 's a shop in @entity96 called @entity289 that she goes to frequently where the staff are terrified of her			0
' @entity45 is also not a woman who is happy to stand in the shadows - something which has upset her wider family at times			0
it was @entity45 who took the helm of the family after her older brothers ' deaths in 2003 , securing the lawyers who would fight for her father in court from exile in @entity18			0
she became known for her impassioned defence of @entity36 , who was captured by @entity169 troops in december 13 , 2003			2
@entity45 appeared on television invited the world 's press into her home as she continued to defend her father - the man who , just seven years before , had had her husband killed			2
' he was a very good father , loving , had a big heart , loved his daughters , sons , grandchildren , ' @entity45 told @entity318 in 2003			0
' he was the one we always go to			0
' @entity321 's son @entity145 , who has been living in exile with his mother in @entity96 , in @entity18 @entity45 is known for her extravagant lifestyle , and appeared to spare little expense for her daughter @entity326 's wedding last year in an interview with @entity330 the next year , it was revealed her home had been turned into a ' shrine ' to him			1
' visitors ushered through the front door by a @entity337 maid find themselves staring at a painting of the deposed dictator , ' it noted			0
it was @entity45 who fought to have her father 's body buried in @entity344 until @entity24 was ' liberated ' from @entity169 forces			1
women who met @entity45 at the school gate were also surprised at how openly she spoke of her beloved father			0
one revealed to the @entity196 in 2006 : ' i remember telling her that i was taking one of my kids out of the school and moving her to the @entity34 international school because she was struggling with @entity354			0
' i asked how her children were getting on with @entity354 and she said they were doing great			0
' then she said something extraordinary : " can you really imagine the grandchildren of @entity36 not being able to speak @entity354 ? "			2
' her admiration for @entity36 has clearly not diminished in the years since his death , as the jewellery clearly shows			2
as for what that might mean for the country of her birth , time will only tell .			0
