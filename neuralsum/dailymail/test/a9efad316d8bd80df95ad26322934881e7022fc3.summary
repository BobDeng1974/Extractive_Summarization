a small mistake from @entity1 allowed @entity3 - mate @entity2 to gain the upper hand in second practice for the @entity6			1
to some extent the duo took it easy in @entity10 as the team focused on a particular plan given the session was hardly representative of what all the drivers will face in qualifying and the race			2
come the start , and with the track exceptionally dusty given its desert setting and which will naturally improve over the weekend with use , the circuit and air temperatures were a searing 52 and 36 degrees centigrade respectively			0
@entity2 ( pictured ) got the better of @entity3 team - mate @entity1 in @entity27 second practice @entity2 was slower in sectors one and two of @entity30 but a mistake from @entity1 gifted him first place @entity1 ( left ) takes a corner in @entity34 , @entity27 ahead of @entity36 driver @entity35 come the start of @entity30 at 6pm local time , when qualifying and the race commence under the hundreds of lights around the circuit , both temperatures had dropped considerably and that is when @entity2 and @entity1 came to the fore			1
in @entity10 pace was not their concern as the duo finished 15th and 16th , 1.466secs and 1.705secs adrift respectively of @entity52 in his @entity36			1
in @entity30 , and with the natural order restored as they finished first and second at the top of the timesheet , just 0.115secs was the gap at the end of their runs on the soft @entity63 tyre , the quicker of the two compounds this weekend			0
that was due to a lock - up from @entity67 in the second sector of the @entity69 which cost him four tenths of a second , otherwise he would likely have beaten @entity2 by three tenths given he was faster in sectors one and two			1
it allowed @entity2 to lead the way with a lap of one minute 34.647secs , with @entity3 ' nearest rivals again @entity52 and @entity35 , but half a second back			1
@entity35 had his issues throughout the day , though , initially in @entity82 as his car suffered a loss of power at one point , but with enough time in hand to ensure he returned to the circuit			2
@entity1 suffered a lock - up in the second sector of the @entity69 , leaving him in second sparks fly from the rear end of @entity67 's @entity3 during a practice session in @entity27 in @entity30 , with nine minutes remaining , @entity96 's @entity95 clipped @entity35 's car , ripping off the front - wing endplate on the left side			1
with debris on the track the session was red flagged , and with the stewards also announcing an investigation into the incident for causing a collision			0
come the restart , @entity52 and @entity1 took a wide berth in exiting the pit lane around a couple of cars that were slow away , far from impressing the stewards who are to also look at the duo 's unnecessary manoeuvres			0
behind the leading quartet came @entity117 ' @entity116 followed by @entity118 in his @entity119 and @entity120 , all within a second of @entity2			0
@entity123 's @entity122 , @entity124 in his @entity119 and the @entity117 of @entity125 completed the top 10 , with the latter 1.237secs off the pace			0
@entity35 had issues throughout the day , eventually finishing the second practice in fourth place @entity35 finished fourth , behind @entity2 , @entity1 and third - placed @entity52 in @entity27 @entity133 's @entity132 was 1.5secs back in 12th , whilst for team - mate @entity134 it was a day to forget			1
in @entity82 an electrical fault which cut the engine in the middle of turn one ended @entity134 's session after just three minutes , with the team unable to carry out a repair			0
in @entity30 the veteran was on his third lap when his car ground to a halt , although on this occasion his mechanics were able to send him back out			2
@entity134 eventually completed 15 laps , finishing down in 19th place between @entity151 duo @entity150 , who finished 4.484secs back , and team - mate @entity153 .			0

@entity2 and @entity1 were 15th and 16th in @entity10
they came to the fore in @entity10 , finishing first and second respectively
@entity1 was faster than @entity2 in sectors one and two , but a lock - up in sector three cost him four tenths of a second
@entity35 had *problems* throughout the day , and his car was clipped by @entity95 in @entity30 , ripping off his front - wing endplate on the left side
