by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:45 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 08:26 est , 3 march 2014 should @entity3 remain in charge of @entity5 ? @entity3 could yet lose his job as @entity5 manager if the @entity8 hit him with a lengthy stadium ban for headbutting @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
@entity5 ’s immediate response on saturday night was to publicly condemn @entity3 for his astonishing touchline attack at the @entity14 and issue him with a formal warning and a £ 100,000 fine			1
it was enough to convince those close to @entity3 that his employers will take no further action - but the club ’s position could change depending on the severity of the punishment			2
his behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of @entity5			2
it is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the @entity51			2
sadly , the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players , but instead on the actions of our manager			0
@entity3 unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player , to @entity11 and its fans , and to the fans of @entity5			1
we have held discussions this evening with @entity3 who has offered his sincere apologies to the @entity11 and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions			1
@entity3 has accepted a formal warning from the @entity11 in relation to his behaviour today and also a @entity11 fine of £ 100,000			1
@entity71 is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment			0
on sunday night @entity8 insiders were not ruling out a stadium ban that could run for at least six games , and possibly even as many as 10 , which would keep him away from @entity5 games for the rest of the season			1
@entity3 would also receive another hefty fine			2
it was only recently that the club dismissed reserve - team coach @entity84 amid allegations that he struck a player , understood to be 19 - year - old defender @entity87 , and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough			0
@entity8 chairman @entity90 has already described it as a ‘ serious ’ issue while leading figures in the game have said @entity3 ’s position is ‘ untenable ’			1
when the then @entity97 manager @entity96 was punished for physically confronting the fourth official in the tunnel at @entity100 earlier this season , he was hit with a five - game stadium ban			1
a 10 - game ban for @entity3 would see him miss the rest of the season with matchday duties switching to assistants @entity106 and @entity107 , leaving @entity5 owner @entity108 looking at the long - term repercussions			1
the controversial owner , who gave @entity3 an eight - year deal last season , is understood to have acted swiftly on saturday evening in an attempt to draw a line under the incident and end speculation that he intends to sack @entity117			1
but @entity108 holds a review of all aspects of the club at the end of every season and @entity3 ’s behaviour is certain to come under scrutiny despite him being almost certain to provide the top - half finish which was his target for this season			2
clash : @entity3 reacted in unprecedented fashion to being barged by the @entity128 international scuffle : the incident started after @entity10 pushed @entity3 out of the way with the ball rolling towards him off you go : @entity3 is sent to the stands by referee @entity135 from above : @entity3 ( centre ) looks on from the stands as @entity5 secured a 4 - 1 win opinionated : @entity139 , who managed @entity5 in 2009 , slammed @entity3 for his headbutt the @entity5 manager fined himself last month for a foul - mouthed attack on @entity144 manager @entity143			1
at the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with @entity151 boss @entity150 during the @entity152			0
the @entity8 certainly see this as the most serious of @entity3 ’s cases , and once the governing body has received the referee ’s report an independent disciplinary commission will be appointed to deal with what is an unprecedented situation			1
the @entity8 will then attempt to deal with @entity3 as rapidly as possible and the fact that he has said he will accept whatever punishment they dish out should mean the case does not go to appeal			2
on sunday even @entity164 , the chief executive of the @entity165 , could not defend @entity3			2
@entity164 was keen to stress that the second longest - serving manager in the @entity51 was ‘ extremely sorry ’ , but having spoken to @entity3 , he said : ‘ the buck stops with @entity3			0
it ’s unacceptable , it ’s inappropriate and it ’s insupportable from every perspective			0
not happy : @entity172 took issue with @entity3 's celebrations as @entity175 beat @entity176 1 - 0 in 2006 heated : @entity150 took exception to @entity3 's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 @entity152 frankly , i was shocked and disgusted by @entity3 ’s incredibly irresponsible action			1
and yet , and even more disturbingly , i was n’t completely surprised			0
@entity3 has a lot of previous , a lengthy list of touchline bust - ups and misbehaviour			0
when manager of @entity186 , i had personal experience of @entity3 ’s touchline impropriety during a play - off semi-final with his then club @entity175			1
i was alarmed , to say the least , by the way he tried to influence the officials			0
he immediately realised the serious error , made sincere apologies to all parties			0
but @entity3 does need to think about how not to put himself in that position again			0
’ @entity3 has said he would have to ‘ sit down and stay out of the way ’ rather than roam his technical area			0
@entity164 nevertheless believes certain issues need to be addressed			0
@entity164 told @entity201 : ‘ we did a technical report last year			0
now we are working on a second report			0
i do n’t mention this now because of @entity3 but because it is an important project			0
' there can be too much traffic in the technical areas and sometimes problems arise because of that			0
' hot water : @entity3 called @entity144 boss @entity143 a ' f * * * * * * old c * * * ' in january best of pals : @entity216 , who has often found himself in trouble for acting out , came out in @entity3 's defence spitting feathers : @entity3 was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against @entity222 in 2012 room with a view : the @entity5 boss was banished to the @entity226 stands after the push november 2006 : @entity3 had earlier in the year criticised @entity176 boss @entity172 for failing to field an @entity229 player in the @entity231 match against @entity232 and matters came to a head in @entity175 's 1 - 0 win over @entity176			1
then @entity175 boss @entity3 's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate @entity172 , who claimed he was ' provoked in a disrespectful way ' , with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official			1
on this occasion , it was the @entity242 boss who was fined by the @entity8 , with @entity3 cleared of all charges			1
march 2012 : in a @entity152 , it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over , with @entity3 , now @entity5 boss , clashing with @entity150 following his celebration to @entity250 's late equaliser in a heated match			1
both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future			0
august 2012 : @entity3 came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour ' ridiculous ' when he shoved linesman @entity259 in the @entity261 ' season opener against @entity222 after disagreeing with the official 's decision to award @entity222 a throw - in			2
@entity3 once again apologised for his actions but the @entity8 took a dim view and hit him with a two - match touchline ban and a £ 20,000 fine			1
january 2014 : @entity3 became involved in another touchline row , less than a month after having heated words with @entity272 boss @entity271 , with @entity144 manager @entity143			2
television cameras clearly showed the @entity5 boss launching an expletive - laden volley at the @entity277			2
@entity3 was spared punishment but said later : ' it was a heat of the moment thing , words we always have as managers , to a degree			0
i 've apologised and i 'm fortunate that he 's accepted that			0

@entity3 could receive a stadium ban from the @entity8 for headbutting @entity11 's @entity10
@entity8 insiders say the ban could be as many as 10 games
@entity5 could sack @entity3 if he is unable to manage the club in the coming weeks
the former @entity175 boss was fined £ 100,000 after the incident
@entity3 was sent to the stands at the @entity14 and will face an @entity8 charge
