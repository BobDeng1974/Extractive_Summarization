a giant sunspot on the solar surface has erupted for the sixth time in a week			1
it is the third major flare in the last 48 hours , from the sunspot which is 14 times larger than @entity4 and almost as big as @entity5			1
@entity6 said the activity confirms the areas as the largest active region seen on the sun in 24 years			1
this was the third @entity15 flare in 48 hours , which erupted from the largest active region seen on the sun in 24 years			1
solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			2
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity4 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			2
' a giant active region on the sun erupted on oct. 26 , 2014 , with its sixth substantial flare since oct. 19 , ' @entity6 said			2
' this flare was classified as an @entity43 - class flare and it peaked at 6:56 a.m. edt			0
' this is the third @entity15 flare in 48 hours , erupting from the largest active region seen on the sun in 24 years			1
previous monster storms on the sun 's surface have unleashed a solar flare in the direction of @entity4 - and there could be more to come			1
' it would seem to be just a matter of time before another strong explosion occurs , ' said @entity56 's @entity55 @entity58 forecaster @entity57 , meanwhile , said the flare affected radio that uses part of the upper atmosphere			2
that includes some but not all radar and plane systems as well as amateur radio			0
mr @entity57 said the storm briefly was rated as strong for affecting @entity4 radio systems but then dropped to minor levels			1
one event event temporarily blacked out a few radio communication systems before weakening			1
an x-class flare erupted from the sun on oct. 25 , 2014 , as seen as a bright flash of light in this image from @entity6 's @entity16			1
the image shows extreme ultraviolet light in the 131 - angstrom wavelength , which highlights the intensely hot material in a flare and which is typically colorized in teal			0
the event followed months of near - silent activity on the sun before the huge flare erupted from a sunspot 14 times bigger than @entity4			1
a spokesperson for the @entity87 told @entity88 it may be the biggest sunspot for 25 years			1
an @entity92 flare erupted from the lower half of the sun today , as seen in the bright flash of light in this image from @entity6 's @entity16 ( @entity16 )			2
this image shows extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 131 angstroms , which highlights the intense heat of a solar flare but they said in the @entity103 there had been ' no reports of any disruption at all			0
there may have been short periods of outage in radio communication but nothing has been repotred as causing problems			1
' flares are massive explosions on the @entity115 associated with sunspots			0
magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy , but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap , releasing their energy as explosions called flares			0
@entity124 is 14 times larger than @entity4 and almost as big as @entity5			1
the @entity87 told @entity88 it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years			1
it is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from @entity4 's surface ( shown in this image from pilot @entity131 ) the light area in the centre of this image is the largest sunspot in this 11 - year solar cycle , says the @entity87 , and it may also have been the largest sunspot for 25 years yesterday 's flare was an @entity92 , which is a million times the combined yield of every single nuclear weapon on @entity4			1
' the sun erupted with another significant flare today , peaking at 10:28 a.m. edt on oct. 22 , 2014 , ' revealed @entity6			0
' @entity6 ’s @entity16 captured images of the event , which occurred in the lower half of the sun. ' this flare is classified as an @entity92 flare			0
' x-class flares denote the most extreme flares			0
' this is the third substantial flare from the same region of the sun since oct. 19			0
' dr @entity150 of @entity6 ’s @entity151 added : ‘ it continues to grow in size and complexity			0
' the sunspot group - @entity155 2192 - has doubled in size to become one of the biggest groups in years , and has been described by astronomy experts as ‘ menacing ’			2
up close : @entity160 taken by @entity161 on october 21 , 2014 from @entity162 , @entity163 solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			2
@entity6 says , ‘ harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity4 ’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground , but when intense enough - they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where @entity175 and communications signals travel			1
’ an @entity16 / @entity177 view of the visible sun showing the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24 , @entity124 - which is approaching the size of @entity4			1
according to experts at @entity185 , ' as of oct. 22 , 2014 ( 11 @entity186 ) the region ’s trailing spots have an area of @entity188 or millionths of a visible solar hemisphere			0
' the largest up until now had been ar11967 on feb. 5 , 2014 , measuring 1580 mh			0
@entity193 is a standard measure used by astronomers for area			0
' just to provide some scale , the surface area of @entity4 is 169 mh - this means that @entity200 is 14 times larger than the surface area of @entity4			1
' according to @entity6 's @entity16 ( @entity16 ) team a single , dynamic active region unleashed over half a dozen solar flares in about 24 hours from 25 to 26 august			2
the two larger flares were m - class ( moderate ) flares and the others were smaller flares			0
this animation shows an ejection associated with the flares			0

solar radiation from storms has already knocked out some radio communication on @entity4
@entity124 is 14 times larger than @entity4 and almost as big as @entity5
largest sunspot in 25 years
it is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from @entity4 's surface
