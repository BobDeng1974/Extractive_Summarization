@entity7 - based artist @entity6 is hosting free temporary rooftop encampments as part of ' @entity10 ' , giving guests the opportunity to spend a night under the stars on an undisclosed @entity1 rooftop and get away from the hustle and bustle of modern life			1
' i think @entity1 — and @entity19 's going to kill me — is a playground , ' @entity6 told @entity21			1
' i look at space utilization in @entity1 and see how we 're all trapped indoors			0
there 's plenty of outdoor space , but it 's just not public			2
and then the question becomes , " what is public and what is private ? " ' under the stars : bivouac @entity10 , a temporary rooftop encampment , lets guests camp in the city ' wilderness ' artist : the project is organized by @entity7 - based artist @entity6 communal : campers are given coffee and access to a toilet at the temporary campsite dining : guests are asked to bring a protein , starch or vegetable to share in a communal dinner as part of @entity6 's exploration of this relationship , campers sign up for a spot in one of seven bivouacs , or temporary shelters , for one night in july and august			1
guests wo n't know where they 're camping until the day before , when they 'll get an email and text notification			0
@entity6 tells the @entity21 guests must put down a refundable $ 200 deposit to ensure everyone who signs up , shows up			2
while guests can sign up with people they know , @entity6 said meeting strangers is one of the major parts of the project			1
' i often do n't know anybody , ' @entity6 said			2
' that 's the wonderful part of making participatory art — i do n't know what will happen			1
' tents : participants have to bring their own sleeping materials , but tents have a 1 - inch wool felt floor exploration : artist @entity6 is using the project to explore public and private space in the city disconnect : bivouac campers like @entity83 do n't have access to the @entity85 or electricity the camp 's amenities include a family - sized canteen with a picnic table for communal dining			1
' guests are encouraged to live their normal daily lives			0
they will leave the site each morning , take the subway and conduct their working hours as usual , ' the project 's website explains			0
' their domestic hours will be spent on the roof , in the great city outdoors , roughing it			0
' the canvas tents have enough room for two or three campers and have a 1 - inch wool felt floor			0
campers have to bring sleeping materials , including pillows and blankets , and one item — either a protein , starch or vegetable — for the communal dinner			2
campers can use a small library in the canteen , but there is no electricity , @entity85 or shower			1
rooftop : participants do n't know where they 'll be camping until the day before shelter : the project has seven bivouacs , or temporary shelters , available for participants views : the undisclosed rooftops are usually in @entity134 or @entity135 to get the best views of @entity137 ' it is all about the experience of disconnecting and meeting , ' the @entity139 website reads			1
like the traditional campsites , the website notes ' this wilderness has an assortment of opinionated neighbors ( new yorkers )			0
please be respectful and try to blend in with your surroundings '			0
the rooftops will likely be in @entity134 or @entity135 , @entity7 , so as to give participants a good view of @entity137 , but @entity6 tells @entity155 he wants to do one @entity156 in @entity157			1
@entity6 said he 's played an organizing role at 30 such events in the last 20 months			1
