by @entity0 published : 12:57 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 12:58 est , 19 february 2013 a young mother who tricked a @entity2 into believing that he was the father of her baby and paying out thousands of pounds in child maintenance has failed to get her prison sentence overturned			1
the conned @entity2 treated the baby girl as his own daughter for five years before the mother 's web of lies unraveled			1
the mother even lied about the results of a paternity test when he sought reassurance that the baby was his			1
she was jailed for six months at @entity19 after admitting two counts of fraud last month			1
but yesterday she failed in a bid to be freed from jail early and allowed to return to her daughter at the @entity25			1
appeal : the mother , who can not be named for legal reasons , failed in her bid to get her six month jail term for fraud overturned at the @entity25 , pictured , yesterday the court heard that the couple , who can not be named to protect the identity of the child , had a ' brief relationship in 2006 but separated shortly before he was deployed to @entity37			1
while he was serving on the frontline , his ex-girlfriend emailed him that she was pregnant with his child			2
despite his suspicions , the @entity2 ' accepted the child as his own ' and began paying towards child support			0
but he asked for proof that the child was his and demanded a paternity test in 2009			0
the negative results were posted to the mother in @entity48 , @entity49 , and she lied by telling the father that the test proved the child was his			1
but the truth finally came to light in 2011 when the @entity2 ordered the results of a second paternity test to be delivered direct to him			0
in a victim impact statement he said that it was not the lost money which hurt him the most , but finding out that the child was not his			0
he described it as like a ' bereavement ' and had decided not to stay in touch with the little girl because he thought it would cause her difficulties in later life			0
the mother said the fraud was not motivated by financial gain , but by wanting her daughter to have consistency in her life			1
' we have no doubt that these offences justified the judge 's conclusion that an immediate custodial sentence was appropriate			0
' mr @entity81 she told judges that she initially believed the @entity2 was the father			0
@entity85 , defending , told mr @entity81 , @entity86 and judge @entity87 at yesterday 's appeal that prison had come as ' a crushing blow ' to her			2
he said her daughter had lost not only the person she thought was her dad - but also her mother for the six months prison sentence			1
but mr @entity81 said the offences were too serious to justify cutting the sentence to release her			0
he said : ' what is absolutely clear is that , at the very latest , the mother was well aware he was n't the father from august 2009 when she received the results of the dna test			2
' there can be little doubt about the devastating effect the mother 's actions have had on him and , in our view , these are important aggravating factors			2
' we have no doubt that these offences justified the judge 's conclusion that an immediate custodial sentence was appropriate			0
' we do n't consider that the sentence imposed by the judge was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive			0

the mother was jailed for six months at @entity19 last month
she failed in a bid to be freed early by the @entity25 yesterday
