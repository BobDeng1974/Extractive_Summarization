by @entity0 last updated at 7:50 am on 17th february 2012 a @entity2 burglar battered and stabbed an elderly couple to death at their home – a week after arriving in the @entity7 to stay with his sister in the house next door			1
in a tragic irony , his victims were also immigrants to this country who , by contrast , had worked hard and built a model family life in @entity17 following their arrival from @entity19 more than 50 years ago			1
killer @entity20 , 22 , watched grandparents @entity22 and @entity25 ’s movements for several days before breaking in to their home while they were out shopping			1
yesterday @entity20 , who tried to blame a fellow pole for the killings , was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 34 years after being convicted of the double murder			1
mr @entity53 told him : ‘ you lack all humanity , you are evil beyond belief			2
you have told this court breathtaking lies in an attempt to escape justice			2
‘ you showed no mercy , no compassion			2
you left them dead upon their bedroom floor and you set about stripping them of their valuables			2
this was a cold - blooded murder			2
yours was an intention to kill			2
you knew you had no intention but to end their lives			2
’ evil : @entity20 battered the @entity19 grandparents before stealing two television from their house and fleeing in their car the judge said he had been ‘ moved almost to tears ’ by the @entity36 family ’s suffering			1
@entity20 , an ex-soldier , had been convicted of burglary in his homeland four years ago and given a suspended sentence			1
but despite the conviction he had open access to the @entity7 as a citizen of the @entity85 , under free movement directives which stipulate that only the most serious offenders can be turned away			1
he arrived in @entity7 by bus in april			1
last night , mr @entity36 ’s sister condemned the regulations and told the @entity91 the @entity2 criminal ‘ should never have been allowed in to the country ’			0
@entity93 said : ‘ he ’s a convicted criminal			0
if he ’s committed crimes in one country then he will do it again in another country			0
’ the victims ’ granddaughter @entity98 , 24 , who found their bodies on @entity101 last year , said : ‘ we hope in prison he gets what he truly deserves and is subjected to the very pain , violence and fear my grandparents were subjected to			1
‘ we hope the very moments that have confined him will torment and disturb his corrupted mind every moment of every day			0
’ she said of the ‘ vile ’ killer ’s sentence : ‘ the death penalty would have been the easy way out for @entity20			1
we would rather have him suffering for what he has done for every day of his sentence			0
’ @entity17 @entity119 heard the @entity19 couple – who moved to the city from @entity123 in 1960 – were found side by side by @entity126 on the floor of the bedroom			1
caught on camera : @entity20 was filmed on @entity130 entering and leaving the house ' evil ' : @entity20 was filmed loading the stolen tvs into the @entity36 's car and driving off probe : forensic officers investigate the scene of the double murder in @entity17 in april last year the bodies of the @entity138 ( right ) were discovered by their granddaughter in an upstairs bedroom after the ' brutal and savage ' attack they are believed to have been attacked the previous evening			1
following the attack , @entity20 was caught on @entity130 loading his victims ’ two televisions – later sold for £ 200 – into their @entity145 car and driving away			1
a short time later he was recorded buying beer in a nearby @entity147			0
the next morning he was twice filmed by a @entity130 camera returning to the property to search for ‘ further pickings ’			0
it could not be established what , if any , valuables he took			0
devoted : the @entity138 on their wedding day in 1957 @entity155 , @entity156 , prosecuting , said that mr @entity36 , a factory worker before his retirement , or his wife would have seen the other being attacked and would have known ‘ the same thing would happen to them ’			0
mr @entity36 received blunt and sharp force injuries to his head , neck and abdomen , with two areas of skull fracturing caused by the hammer , which led to haemorrhaging of the brain			2
his wife had stab wounds to the neck as well as defensive injuries			0
@entity20 ’s fingerprints and blood were found on the murder weapons and his dna in a pair of gloves and on a pear he had taken a bite from in the kitchen			1
mr @entity36 ’s dna was recovered from trainers found at @entity20 ’s sister ’s home			1
but the killer tried to pin the double killing on a 32 - year - old fellow pole , @entity188 , telling the jury : ‘ i did not kill them			0
i was downstairs when it happened			0
i did not want to know what he had done to the old folks			0
’ @entity188 , of @entity17 , a father of two who came to @entity194 in 2006 , denied handling the stolen property from the @entity197 ’ home and was cleared by the jury			0
@entity199 , the @entity201 @entity200 mp for @entity202 , said : ‘ this sort of incident is sickening			0
‘ being an island nation , we should have an advantage in terms of controlling who comes through our borders but through our membership of the @entity85 we have tossed that advantage away to the point that we do n’t know who has come in to the country			0
the consequences of that , as in this case , can be incredibly serious			0
’ a @entity220 spokesman said : ‘ public protection is our number one priority			0
we will not accept foreign criminals breaking @entity7 laws and will seek to deport any @entity227 national who commits a serious offence			1
