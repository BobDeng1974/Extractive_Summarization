by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 28 august 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 28 august 2013 a ‘ brain in a bottle ’ has been grown by stem cell scientists who hope it will lead to treatments for neurological and mental diseases			1
the ‘ organoids ’ , three to four millimetres across , have a structure similar to that of an immature human brain			1
but the scientists insist that they are still far from creating an artificial brain – or even parts for damaged brains			2
the goal was to produce a biological tool that can be used to investigate the workings of the brain , better understand brain diseases , and test new drugs			0
scientists have created pea - sized brains from a patient 's skin that could lead to cures for common neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and autism			1
image shows a comparison between a developing brain ( left ) and the organoid ( right ) that the team created professor @entity35 , of the @entity36 in @entity37 , derived the ips cells ( induced pluripotent stem cells ) from the connective tissue of a patient with microcephaly			1
this is a rare but devastating genetic disorder in which brain size is dramatically reduced leaving the sufferer with severe mental disability			0
like many neurological conditions , the disease has been difficult to study in mice because they do not share the same brain complexity as us			2
the new miniature brains - called cerebral organoids - helped the researchers identify a defect that affects normal brain development in microcephaly leading to a smaller brain			1
the cells disrupted in humans do not undergo the same expansion in mice explaining why mouse models have been unable to replicate the severity of this disorder , said the researchers			2
the team used a 3d matrix scaffold that mimics the environment of a human embryo and special lab devices , called spinning bio reactors , which produce nutrients and oxygen , to grow the brains			1
using stem cells - master cells that can turn into almost any cell type in the body - researchers grew skin cells into @entity83 tissue that mimics a brain			1
image shows a cross-section of an entire organoid professor @entity35 said : ‘ we turned patient derived cells into primitive cells called ips cells and then used those to generate the cerebral organoids and compare them to ones from healthy patients			0
‘ ultimately , we would like to use them to study more common disorders like schizophrenia or autism as it has been shown the underlying defects occur during the development of the brain			2
‘ we are satisfied - or we hope - we will be able to model some of these defects as well			0
’ he said the cultures also offer hope of testing drugs in a human setting to avoid animal experiments and get more informed results which become easily transferable to cures in humans			0
dr @entity114 , a neuro - pathologist and renowned expert in stem cell research at @entity117 in @entity118 , reviewed the study for the journal and described it as ‘ remarkable ’			0
they displayed an organisation similar to that seen in the early stages of the developing human brain 's cerebral cortex			1
image shows a magnified picture of an organoid he said : ‘ the authors find when left to aggregate under appropriate conditions neural cells generated from human @entity134 cells self - organise into cerebral organoids - up to pea - sized miniatures of developing human brain tissue			1
‘ these structures are not just peculiar lab artefacts			0
as the authors show the organoids recreate early steps in the formation of the human brain ’s cerebral cortex and so lend themselves to studies of brain development and neuro - developmental disorders			1
’ dr @entity149 , from the @entity150 at the @entity151 , questioned why anyone would ever want to create a ‘ real ’ human brain			1
‘ a human brain that was “ fully working ” would be conscious , have hopes , dreams , feel pain , and would ask questions about what we were doing to it , ’ he said			2
‘ something we have grown in the lab , but on a much simpler level than a human brain , might be hooked up to electronic eyes , ears , and hands and be taught to do something - maybe something that is as sophisticated as many simple living creatures			1
that does n’t seem so far off to me			0
’ neuroscientist professor @entity173 , from @entity174 , said : ‘ this study offers the promise of a major new tool for understanding the causes of major developmental disorders of the brain such as autism and schizophrenia , as well as testing possible treatments			2
treatments are still a long way off , but this important study illuminates part of the pathway to them			0
’ stem cell scientist dr @entity190 , from @entity191 and the @entity192 , described the research as ‘ fascinating and exciting ’			0
he added : ‘ the structure they have generated is a long way from a real brain and the challenges for creating even a primitive foetal brain remain daunting			0
hopes to recreate a real brain therefore remain distant			0
the proper organisation and blood supply of the brain are not present in this model and are major limitations			0
‘ however , their model is audacious and the similarities with some of the features of a human brain are really quite astounding			2

scientists used stem cells to grow @entity83 tissue that mimics a brain
the cells displayed an organisation similar to that seen in the early stages of the developing human brain 's cerebral cortex - also known as grey matter
the miniature brains helped the researchers identify a defect that affects normal brain development in microcephaly leading to a smaller brain
the findings could eventually lead to treatments for other neurological disorders
