the problem for @entity1 no longer concerns what happened in @entity3 on tuesday but is about what may happen at @entity5 on saturday			1
as the rumpus continues after that team selection for @entity10 ’s biggest @entity9 away date since 2009 , @entity1 has plunged himself into an invidious position : he has to deliver now against @entity12			1
@entity1 did not hatch his plan for the @entity14 on a whim			1
he knew it would spark discussion but never could he have expected it on this scale			0
fans , former players and even @entity23 boss @entity22 have had something to say			2
much of it has been scathing			0
having placed such an emphasis on the showdown with @entity12 , @entity1 can not afford a similar result			1
@entity42 , a @entity43 winner with @entity10 in 1984 , said : ‘ who is agreeing with what @entity1 is saying ? @entity10 have won the @entity43 five times			1
to go anywhere , lose 1 - 0 and stick a reserve team out is not on			1
‘ he said it was a superb performance			0
the man of the match was ( @entity53 ) @entity52 , the keeper , so you could n’t have been doing that well defensively if your keeper was getting shot at all the time			0
‘ in the second half , @entity3 almost fell asleep			2
so i ’m thinking , “ go on @entity1			2
get someone else on and see if we can nick something ”			0
and what was there ? one shot on target			0
i mean , come on			0
we are talking about @entity10 here , not some second - rate team happy to lose 1 - 0			1
’ others from @entity10 ’s glorious past joined in			2
@entity72 , a former @entity3 manager , wondered why @entity1 was worrying about getting into next season ’s @entity43 when their hopes in this year ’s competition are in jeopardy			1
‘ @entity10 are going through a dodgy spell and it looked like a damage - limitation job , ’ said @entity72			1
‘ when you start a game and pass back to the midfielder , to the defender , to the goalkeeper , who kicks it straight out of play , something is not as it should be			0
if @entity10 had nicked a goal , @entity3 would have got another one			1
@entity92 ( centre ) had spoke of his excitement to face @entity3 after the @entity43 draw was made , but had to settle for a place in the starting line - up ... will he start against @entity12 on saturday ? over 5000 @entity10 fans made the trip to the @entity14 expecting @entity1 to field his possible strongest team ‘ there is a hangover from what happened at @entity104 last season [ when @entity10 blew a 3 - 0 lead to wreck their title bid ]			1
that was a bitter pill to swallow			0
‘ @entity10 need to get some silverware on the table pretty quickly			2
i ’ve seen situations like that [ at @entity104 ] before and they can hang around for a while			0
’ that point is key			0
the selection in @entity3 can be debated for ever , because there are those such as @entity118 - another @entity43 winner - who point out @entity1 ’ best xi were demolished 3 - 0 by @entity3 at @entity5			1
but the fact @entity1 gave @entity92 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity59 a night off in @entity3 suggests he is on a revenge mission for the 2 - 0 defeat @entity12 inflicted on april 27			1
@entity92 will be on a revenge mission after his slip against @entity12 last season			2
was @entity1 saving him for that when he left him on the bench in @entity3 ? @entity10 , and @entity92 , will host @entity12 on saturday for the first time since their 2 - 0 defeat in april that was the day @entity10 ’s title dream truly died			1
@entity1 said on monday the @entity134 was @entity10 ’s priority			1
traditionalists who have grown up on the triumphs in @entity138 ( twice ) , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 may baulk but that is how the manager sees it			0
‘ you sometimes ca n’t win with a squad rotation policy but that is the only way to go , ’ argued @entity10 midfielder @entity145			2
‘ with the added demands we have , that is definitely going to get us results over the course of the season			0
’ looking ahead to @entity12 , he added : ‘ sometimes you feel you almost owe them one			1
it was a big disappointment when they came and took three points off us , so it is a case of wanting to pay them back a bit			0
but you ca n’t focus too much on last season			0
’ perhaps , subconsciously , they are			0
this week has been framed for a grandstand finish against @entity165 there is no room for error			0
@entity169 , @entity10 ’s principal owner , is in @entity170 for a series of a meetings aimed at securing new business partnerships for the club			2
the @entity175 watched @entity177 ’s match on wednesday night alongside former @entity10 chief executive @entity178 .			2

@entity10 lost 1 - 0 away to @entity3 in tuesday 's @entity43 tie
@entity183 boss @entity1 fielded a weakened team in @entity185 ahead of @entity10 's @entity134 clash against @entity12 on saturday
@entity1 has been *widely* *slammed* for him team selection against @entity3
*pressure* is on @entity1 to be *rectified* for his choice against the @entity192
