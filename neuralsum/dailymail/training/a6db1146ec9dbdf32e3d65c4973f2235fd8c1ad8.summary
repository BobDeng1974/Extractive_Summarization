by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 4 june 2013 letting churchgoers park free of charge in town centre car parks on sundays discriminates against non-believers , a secular campaigner claims			1
@entity6 is suing a local council over the scheme , which applies to individuals of all faiths			2
mr @entity6 , of the @entity11 , argues that by allowing free parking for those attending churches in @entity15 , @entity16 , the local council is contravening the @entity17			1
discrimination claim : @entity6 , executive director of the @entity11 says it is unfair that churchgoers get free parking permits in @entity15 , @entity16 , while he still had to pay £ 3 free parking pass : one of the permits issued to worshippers in @entity15 by churchers , with the backing of the council ‘ the equal treatment of all , regardless of belief or non-belief , is a key secular principle , ’ he said			1
‘ it is neither legitimate nor lawful for local government to subsidise the activities of any particular religion and belief group			0
' it would be fairer if the council either charged worshippers for parking or provided free parking for all			1
’ after receiving a number of complaints from local residents , mr @entity6 drove to @entity15 on sunday april 14 and paid £ 3 to park in the @entity48 car park for more than two hours			1
those at church services parked in the same car park for free			2
mr @entity6 ’s ‘ less favourable treatment ’ was because of religious belief , his lawyers argue in what will be a test case for local authorities all over the country			0
unholy row : @entity61 's lawyers advised that the free permits could be justified free parking : @entity64 has been issuing free parking passes to worshippers to use on a sunday morning they point out that local churches have been provided with ticket validating machines or parking permits			1
@entity61 confirmed it had received the notice of legal action from @entity11 ’s lawyers			0
council official @entity74 defended the free parking , saying that faith communities play an important role in voluntary work and promoting social inclusion			1
he added : ‘ the council took legal advice			0
it was advised that it amounted to indirect discrimination , but could be justified on the basis that it was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim			0
’ @entity86 gives out council - backed parking permits to churchgoers valid between 9.30am and 1pm on sundays			1
the issue of free parking for worshippers has become increasingly contentious as more councils scrap free sunday parking to pursue extra revenue			1
the charges were initially denounced as a ' tax on worshippers ' and a number of local authorities set up ' worship parking permit ' schemes			2
row : @entity15 , in @entity102 , @entity16 , issue the free parking passes in a scheme backed by the council however , there are mixed feelings about the case in @entity15			1
office worker @entity108 , 44 , said : ‘ i am not a churchgoer myself but i think that it is very sad that the @entity111 feels it is necessary to take this costly action			0
‘ no doubt the council will incur a large legal bill defending its decision			0
i am sure that as well as the churches , the council helps other organisations with subsidised parking			2
’ but businessman @entity120 , 57 , supports the challenge			0
he said : ‘ if you are going to give one group of people free parking then you need to give it to them all			2
‘ this is completely unfair			0
why should i be discriminated against because i am an atheist ? ’			0
