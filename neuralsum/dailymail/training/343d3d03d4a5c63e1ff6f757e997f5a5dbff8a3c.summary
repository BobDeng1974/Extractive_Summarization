hashtag phrases include multiple words stringed together			0
they will be presented with a list of other users across the site that are also currently using that word or phrase and discussing the same things			0

the music video for @entity145 by singer @entity147 features his surname and a hashtag flashing on screen throughout commenting on the announcement , digital advertising company @entity177 said : the omnipresence of the hashtag continues to grow and @entity2 ’s savvy decision to adopt and adapt the feature demonstrates the brands need to remain current and drive innovation , it ’s only surprising that it did n’t jump on this sooner			2
we have been offering hashtag targeting tools to marketers since the beginning of this year and this has provided extremely positive results for our clients so far			0
the addition of hashtag recognition to @entity2 will further bolster our offering and provide even more insight to brands			2
