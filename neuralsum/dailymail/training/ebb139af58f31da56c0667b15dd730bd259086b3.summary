discovery : men should not take high doses of vitamin e ( pictured ) or selenium supplements because they have no health benefits and increase the risk of prostate cancer by up to a fifth , @entity19 researchers have claimed this can rise to as much as 91 per cent if a man already has high levels of selenium before taking supplements			1
the warning centres on high - dose supplements , with researchers saying there appear to be no risks from taking a standard multivitamin			2
