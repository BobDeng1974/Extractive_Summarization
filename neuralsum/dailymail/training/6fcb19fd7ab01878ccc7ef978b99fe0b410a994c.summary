controversy : @entity1 , a methodist priest in @entity2 , refuses to wear a red poppy when she leads the @entity5 service a minister has refused to wear a poppy when she conducts this year 's remembrance service because she believes the symbol ' advocates war '			1
@entity1 told other clergy that she would be happy to sport a white poppy during the proceedings on @entity5 , but will not wear a red one			1
her decision has upset many parishioners at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity2 , who claimed that the @entity21 - born priest ' does n't seem to realise ' the importance of the poppy			1
ms @entity1 , who calls herself ' @entity24 ' , last week told local councillors it was her ' democratic right ' not to wear the poppy when conducting the service on november 10			1
she did not give a reason for her refusal at the time , but a spokesman for the church said it was because ms @entity1 is an advocate of peace			2
' @entity37 is happy to wear a white poppy , but does n't want to wear a red one because she feels it advocates war which is something she does not believe in , ' he said			1
' she is in favour of peace and reconciliation			0
she is not doing it to be antagonistic - if anything , it is the opposite			0
' however , today locals suggested that if ms @entity1 was unwilling to wear the poppy along with most of the congregation , she should not be leading the remembrance service			1
church : the service will take place at @entity17 in @entity18 on november 10 @entity57 parish councillor @entity56 , who served in the @entity58 for 38 years , said : ' i just think it is unbelievable			0
' if someone says they do n't want to wear a poppy because of their right to democracy i would say that is absolutely correct , but if they do n't want to , do n't get involved in the remembrance service			2
' the @entity70 are absolutely brilliant in the way they organise the remembrance parade			0
' fellow councillor @entity74 added : ' @entity75 and all the people associated with it passionately support the @entity77			0
' the minister does n't seem to realise how important it is to us to wear the poppy			2
this is all political and i ca n't respect that in these circumstances			0
i find the whole thing very sad			0
' iconic : ms @entity1 says the normal red poppy , left , is overly warlike and will only wear a white poppy , right @entity89 , president of the @entity57 and @entity90 , said : ' from the military members who attend the service - and there are a lot - we were very shocked			1
' if someone decides they do n't want to wear a poppy , that is down to the individual , but if they are officiating a remembrance service , just for an hour , an hour and a half , it 's not going to cut anyone 's throat to wear one			2
' mr @entity89 said that the remembrance service would go ahead at the church as planned .			0
