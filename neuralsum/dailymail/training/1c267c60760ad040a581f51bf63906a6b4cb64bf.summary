by @entity0 published : 07:32 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 21:02 est , 6 february 2013 there are not many brave enough to get on the back of a 2,000lbs bucking bull - and definitely not many 5ft5in girls - but there is at least one , and she is doing pretty well for herself			1
@entity7 is the world 's only female bull rider to compete professionally in the men 's category and although she is only 20 years old , she is considered a veteran , having competed in nearly 200 rodeos			1
despite her slender frame , @entity7 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , regularly takes on bulls that weigh in excess of 2,000lbs - over 15 times her own size			1
she said : ‘ bull riding is one of the most dangerous sports because you 're up against an animal and you do n't know what he is going to do or what he 's thinking			0
‘ you will get bulls that are meaner than others but you really have to respect them			0
you ca n't ride against them , you have to ride with them			0
’ @entity7 's path to the bull ring began four years ago in her hometown of @entity48 , @entity13 , when a family friend who used to ride bulls took her to a rodeo and she was hooked			1
ready to do : @entity7 prepares her ropes by adding rosin , making it sticky enough to get a better grip for holding on while being bucked by the bull before heading for the chute in @entity57 , @entity58 hold on tight : @entity7 needs to stay on the bull for eight seconds in order to score in a rodeo bull - ied : although @entity7 is barely 5ft 5in , she regularly takes on bulls that weigh over 2,000 lbs going , going , gone : @entity7 has her rope in a rights grip and tries to hold her balance aboard the animal as the bull runs and bucks aged 17 she left home to live in the southern states , working on ranches in @entity72 and @entity73 to fund her bull riding training , and recently moved to @entity57 , @entity58 , to be trained by top mentor @entity75			1
@entity7 says her parents are supportive of her unusual career path - despite the obvious dangers			2
but desite winning plaudits as a female in a predominantly male sport , @entity7 says she still faces difficulties in being accepted - especially when she gets bucked off a bull			1
rough ride : the 20 - year - old left her family behind in @entity13 and moved to @entity58 in order to become a better bullrider rough ride : in order for @entity7 to qualify to be a professional bullrider she needs to stay on the bull for more than eight seconds she said : ‘ they [ men ] say , " this is why girls should n't ride bulls and girls are n't made for this			1
" but it all depends on the person			0
‘ you 're either a good bull rider or you 're not			0
it takes a long time to gain people 's respect and get treated the same as the men			2
‘ sometimes it 's been harder for me because when you 're learning how to ride a bull you 're going to get bucked off - and you 're going to get hurt			2
it 's just not going to look very pretty while you 're riding			0
’ she now wears a full face mask and helmet to protect her , but revealed she has suffered being stood on by the bulls and endured knocks to the head			0
devotion : @entity7 shows off her own tribute to her chosen sport - a back - tattoo of herself on a bucking bull @entity7 , who says she is just as comfortable in a summer dress as she is in her stetsons , said : ‘ if i did n't wear my helmet i 'd probably be a vegetable by now because i 've been hit in the head			2
’ to keep on top of her sport , @entity7 does ranch work , conducts regular workouts at the gym and practices techniques on a stationary barrel			2
speaking of his protege , @entity7 's trainer @entity75 , who has coached 12 world champions , said : ‘ she was n't very good when she came to me but she had grit			1
