he and friends had gone abroad for the ski trip , believed to be in @entity38 , where they shot the footage			0
but a disgusted student uploaded the clip to @entity43 this week - which has been viewed 5,000 times - branding him ' vile ' and demanding an apology			1

a friend of the victim tries to stop him but he forces her away before carefully unhooking the bra			0
he then triumphantly turns around to face the camera holding his fist in the air			0
the video repeats the motion several times before a sign appears on screen stating : ' @entity77 ( @entity78 )			2
we demand an apology from @entity6 for his foul , sexist behaviour			2
