‘ i think @entity7 said something that is interesting ; he is against the @entity1 , and i think he ’s right , because in this moment football is losing a little bit the concept of the team to focus more on the individual , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we are always looking at the individual performance , the individual stat , the player that runs more			0
because you run 11km in a game and i run nine you did a better job than i did ? maybe not ! maybe my 9km were more important than your 11			2
