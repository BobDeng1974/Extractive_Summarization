@entity0 was always confident the day would arrive when calls for him to be sacked would quieten - and he has likened @entity2 ’s revival to building @entity4 furniture			1
the @entity2 boss - whose wife is @entity7 - says that he went back to basics amid a seven - game winless start to the season which saw fans protest against his employment			2

‘ you 've got to box it down			0
it 's a bit like one of those @entity4 furniture packs you buy , ’ he said			1
‘ you ca n't try and get to the end , you 've got to do all the little bits to get there and it takes time			0
i 've done a few of them because my wife 's @entity7			0
‘ it 's about doing that little bit first , and if you get that wrong , the second bit does n't work			0
if you get the second bit wrong , the third bit definitely isn ’ t working and the tabletop is all over the place			0
@entity57 celebrates scoring for @entity2 during the 2 - 0 victory at the @entity59 on wednesday @entity2 boss @entity0 believes his side now have serious ' momentum ' going into @entity18 clash ‘ i think it 's very important , if you 're in the managerial world , that you actually segment it down and just say , “ right , what 's our problem , what do we need to do , what needs to happen at this football club to turn us from what we are to a better team ? ”			1
‘ we did a review of how we were getting at teams and how they were getting at us			0
that helped us and i think we 've put some blocks in place that gives us something to hinge on to			0
’ it speaks volumes that @entity0 is able to offer such light - hearted metaphor , for just four weeks ago there was no scope for levity			2
a website - @entity89 - had attempted to mobilise fans into forcing the manager out of the club			2
disgruntled @entity14 supporters display ' @entity89 ' banners against @entity96 back in september @entity2 manager @entity0 congratulates @entity97 after wednesday 's @entity23 success as one supporter on social media joked this week , perhaps they will change the domain name to @entity103 in light of the turnaround			1
@entity0 , though , never lost faith in his own ability			2
‘ as an experienced manager , i ’ve had times like that before , ’ he said			0
‘ not perhaps with the scale of the media criticism that i was receiving , but i ’ ve had results like that at @entity114 and @entity115 , and you have to try to find a solution			0
@entity120 runs off in celebration after heading in the winner for @entity2 at @entity123 @entity120 heads @entity2 into the lead against @entity123 as the @entity14 went on to win 2 - 1 on sunday ‘ if you do n’t believe you ’re strong enough as a character to find a solution , then do n’t do the job			1
i ’m confident i can do this job , and i was always confident i could turn it around			0
’ the 2 - 0 victory at @entity22 in the @entity23 in midweek arrived on the back of wins at home to @entity135 and at @entity123			1
another maximum return in saturday 's early kick - off would take them into the top half of the @entity140			1
and @entity0 went on : ‘ i ’ve always thought the same since i first became a manager - momentum is the key to success in sport			1
@entity2 players celebrate with @entity120 after the @entity147 striker scored the winner at @entity149 @entity97 scores after seven minutes to set @entity2 on their way to shock win at @entity22 ‘ i give the example of @entity153			1
you can see at the moment that he ’s entered tournaments that might not normally be on his agenda , but he wants to win them because there ’s a big one coming up at the end of the season and he wants to be in form for it			0
‘ i think that ’s how managers approach every game			0
you want to build momentum , and we have great momentum at the moment			0
there ’s no way we could have won at @entity22 if we had n’t won at @entity123			2
’ from @entity176 tennis players to @entity7 flat - pack furniture , @entity2 ’s recent rally has certainly turned the table for their boss			1
