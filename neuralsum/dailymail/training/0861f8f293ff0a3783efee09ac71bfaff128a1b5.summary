@entity0 said @entity1 can expect to win major silverware within two years but warned of suffering in store in the meantime			1
the @entity1 manager said : ‘ sometimes to change something you need time			1
you need to suffer and have the bad moments			2
we know we ’re heading in the right direction			2
‘ it may be in six months , one year , or two years			2
but i ’m sure in the end the club will achieve a very important trophy			2
’ @entity0 believes his @entity1 side should target a trophy within the next two years @entity1 players train ahead of their @entity20 clash with @entity21 on thursday spurs sit third in their @entity20 group and host @entity24 side @entity21 on thursday			1
they slipped to ninth in the @entity27 with a 4 - 1 defeat at @entity29 on saturday			0
but , despite winning just two of their last nine games , they are still only two points away from the @entity36 places			2
it is by no means a crisis			0
the worry , perhaps , is that key personnel are struggling to deliver			0
@entity41 , a £ 26million striker with just six goals in 31 league appearances , had his penalty saved by @entity45 as he made his first league start of the season against @entity29 , while @entity48 has scored once this campaign			0
add defensive frailties in the big games - they have also lost 3 - 0 at home to @entity53 - and it is easy to see why @entity1 have the worst goal difference in the top half of the table			1
@entity0 conceded that results were a concern , but was looking at the bigger picture			1
‘ we need to start scoring goals but we have confidence in our strikers , ’ he said			0
‘ we made a lot of changes at the beginning of the season with our squad and had to implement a different philosophy on the group			0
@entity73 winger @entity72 ( centre ) jokes with his @entity1 team - mates during training @entity72 ( centre ) and @entity78 train ahead of @entity1 's important @entity20 clash ‘ the same happened at @entity80 when we arrived			1
maybe in four or five months we will have changed the mentality			0
we need time , then we are confident we will show more consistency			0
’ @entity1 chairman @entity83 has a reputation for being quick to press the ‘ manager eject ’ button , with 10 different managers passing through @entity88 during his 13 - year tenure so far			1
but @entity0 insisted he and the board were on the same page			1
‘ when they offered me the job @entity95 was very clear with me and explained a little bit how we need to move the club on , ’ he said			0
‘ we agreed - we want to build something special at @entity1 , different but better than before			1
’ the building process continues this evening as @entity1 host @entity21 , who top @entity103 after beating @entity104 in the last game and holding @entity106 to a draw			1
spurs drew both their previous matches			0
@entity110 could make another @entity112 appearance for @entity1 against @entity21 the @entity114 ’ squad contains seven @entity115 , including strikers @entity116 and @entity118			1
and @entity0 , a former @entity119 international , knows how dangerous his countrymen can be			1
‘ it is a very good team , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i know a lot about the @entity115 and they are very good			0
they are offensive , brave and we expect a tough game			0
’ left back @entity125 , who has found first team football hard to come by since arriving from @entity127 in the summer , is expected to start			0
@entity125 , 21 , said he would not throw his toys out of the pram as he competes with @entity130 for a starting spot at @entity1			1
@entity0 was coy about whether @entity125 would soon be his first choice			2
‘ he ’s still young , ’ he said			0
‘ we knew when we signed him what his potential is but it is competition for @entity130			0
‘ i have a strong squad but we need to put the players on the pitch who can get three points ( on thursday )			2
it ’s a very important game			0
’ @entity1 players step out at their training ground and prepare for a session ahead of the @entity20			1
