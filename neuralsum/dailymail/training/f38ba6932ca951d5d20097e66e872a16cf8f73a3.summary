by @entity0 published : 18:21 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 6 november 2013 a senior @entity2 mp has accused two barristers at the heart of the @entity6 inquiry of failing to provide ‘ basic information ’ to a legal watchdog investigating their affair			0
@entity11 , parliamentary aide to chancellor @entity12 , has delivered a damning response to the testimony of @entity15 and a barrister representing advocates of draconian press regulation , who have been revealed to have embarked on a romantic relationship			1
mr @entity11 has demanded a probe into whether the relationship between the mother - of - two , who is now divorced , and @entity23 breached professional standards and could have compromised the @entity6 inquiry ’s findings			1
@entity28 , council for the inquiry , and @entity23 have been accused of failing to give a full account of her relationship the @entity33 advises lawyers it is ‘ very unwise ’ to start a relationship with an opposing lawyer because of the likely perception of a ‘ danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy ’			1
mr @entity11 said standards of conduct applying to sexual relations between barristers working at judicial inquiries should be at least as high as at adversarial court cases			2
mr @entity23 , who represented actor @entity49 and other celebrity victims of phone hacking , went on holiday to the @entity54 island of @entity55 with miss @entity28 in august last year			1
she was a member of the inquiry ’s counsel team , charging the taxpayer fees of £ 218,606 between july 2011 and november 2012 for her work			1
she became known as ‘ the woman on the left ’ and received thousands of mentions on @entity63 for her close attention to mr @entity49 ’s evidence during the 97 - day inquiry			0
the couple claim they simply discussed the ‘ possibility of a future relationship and decided against it ’ while on their @entity54 holiday			0
@entity11 , conservative mp for @entity74 , has demanded a probe into whether or not the pair 's relationship breached professional standards they say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in december			1
mr @entity11 ’s response to their evidence to the @entity86 , which is investigating the affair , claims miss @entity28 ‘ acknowledges that she knew she would be responsible for writing sections of the @entity6 report before booking and going on a holiday to @entity55 with mr @entity23 ’			1
the mp claims she admits she did not inform either sir @entity6 or @entity92 , the inquiry ’s lead counsel , about the trip			0
in a letter to the @entity86 , he complains that in a 19 - page submission , mr @entity23 ‘ does not even provide basic facts about the relationship ’ , including ‘ when they became friends , when relations between them became ( i ) romantic and ( ii ) sexual , and when they first realised that they may end up forming a relationship ... ‘ nor does ms @entity28 explain when , during the course of her involvement with the inquiry , it became apparent to her and mr @entity23 their “ friendship ” had the potential to develop into a romantic relationship			2
i suggest the @entity86 will want to establish these basic facts for the sake of completeness			0
’ the mp also expresses alarm at the argument that the rules which apply to lawyers taking part in a court case do not apply in a judge - led inquiry such as that headed by sir @entity6			0
‘ members of @entity125 and the public would be deeply concerned to learn that the legal profession considers it appropriate to attach lower standards of independence and professional conduct to the legal staff of judicial inquiries than those that would be applied to barristers , solicitors and court staff in ordinary legal proceedings , ’ he writes			0
actor @entity49 was represented by @entity23 at the @entity139 where ms @entity140 was a member of counsel the mp says depending on the @entity86 ’s verdict , it may be necessary to spell out explicit new codes of conduct for the staff of public inquiries , including barristers			1
in his letter , mr @entity11 added that it was a ‘ matter of concern in itself ’ that sir @entity6 had refused to ‘ even entertain the thought that the relationship between the barristers may have given rise to concern despite the @entity33 ’s clear advice ’			2
mr @entity11 told the @entity159 : ‘ in 50 - odd pages of submissions , they did n’t even provide details about when they became friends			0
‘ for a member of the @entity139 team who wrote up part of the draft @entity6 report to have had an affair during the inquiry with a barrister who has made a career out of opposing the press … is a serious matter			2
mr @entity11 found it worrying that @entity6 refused to ' even entertain the thought that the relationship between the barristers may have given rise to concern despite the @entity33 ¿ s clear advice ' ' @entity183 needs to get to the truth about what happened and when			0
’ sir @entity6 has flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into press standards may have been tainted by the relationship			1
the @entity86 can impose punishments ranging from words of advice , fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off .			0
