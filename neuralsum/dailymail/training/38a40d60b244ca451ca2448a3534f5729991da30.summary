ancient human remains of what has been dubbed the ' oldest @entity2 ' have been uncovered in silts close to the @entity4 in @entity5			1
archaeologists unearthed 200,000 - year - old left arm bones at @entity8 which are believed to belong to a young @entity9			1
an unusual raised ridge on the upper - arm bone suggests that the @entity9 suffered should muscle damage from repeatedly throwing a spear			1
human remains of what has been dubbed the ' oldest @entity2 ' have been found in silts close to the @entity4 in @entity5			0
pictured are the remains ( left ) alongside the equivalent arm bones of a female @entity9 if this proves to be true , it could provide evidence that @entity9 were capable of creating throwing spears , rather than simply using thrusting weapons to hunt			1
' we have a particular morphology on the humerus where we have this very important crest that is related probably to a specific movement - a specific movement that has been repeated by this individual , ' dr @entity23 a palaeontologist at the @entity25 told the @entity32			0
' right at that point , we have a kind of micro-trauma , which could be related to a movement that is more difficult , and it has created this strange relief			0
' the arm bones – a humerus , radius and ulna – were found by archaeologists from the @entity43			1
he unusual crest was revealed using computer tomography scans which found it may have been created by an injury to the deltoid muscle at the owner 's shoulder			1
pictured are @entity52 - based 3d mapping of the thickness of the bones in the latest find the unusual crest was revealed using computer tomography scans which found it may have been created by an injury to the deltoid muscle at the owner 's shoulder			1
the interpretation that thrown spears were used 200,000 years ago in @entity63 is ' controversial ' according to @entity64 , a curator at the @entity65 in @entity66 speaking with @entity67			0
but a separate study earlier this year uncovered 80,000 - year - old spear tips which scientist believe were probably created by ancestors to ancient humans , rather than by our species			1
controversy surrounds the precise date that early man began to use stone - tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago			2
a separate study done in may by @entity82 , of @entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 , professor @entity82 shaped flint reproductions of spear and arrow points from the @entity89 in @entity90 and attached them to wooden shafts			1
together with a group of @entity94 students , @entity82 ran 15 experiments , throwing replica spears with bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses			2
the results showed ' quite a difference between the butchering marks and projectile impact marks , ' and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds , from drag marks to fracture marks and punctures			0
these findings prompted @entity82 and the @entity94 's @entity111 to take a new look at three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two vertebrae - from @entity116 in @entity90			2
two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years ago and the third dated even earlier , between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them , at the time , the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile weapons			1
this discovery means @entity122 , an ancestor to both humans and @entity9 , was much more technologically advanced than previously thought			1
homo sapiens then either developed the technology themselves , or learned it from @entity122 , which helped them to move out of @entity90 and out - compete @entity9			2
researchers are now studying the stone javelin tips , recently found at an @entity134 @entity133 site known as @entity135			0
the arm bones – a humerus , radius and ulna – were found by archaeologists from the @entity43			1
pictured is the river bank where they were found researchers made their find at @entity8 , roughly 100km from the @entity5 capital , @entity2 scientists the @entity148 at @entity150 's @entity149 were recently able to study the spears and determine their age			2
writing in the journal @entity154 , they claim the weapons were made from obsidian - a naturally occurring volcanic glass known for its high blast resistance and strength			2
' [ this ] is significant because it provides direct evidence for a highly advantageous , complex technology that pre-dates the emergence of @entity125 , ' said the authors of the study			0
researchers believe the direct ancestor of @entity125 in @entity90 , and @entity9 in @entity63 and @entity169 , is the @entity122 , also known as @entity122			0
previous evidence shows that @entity122 was an accomplished tool - maker and skillfully butchered large animals			0
however , the stone - tipped spears have provided a clearer understanding of the extent of this species skills			0
the oldest known stone - tipped spears predate the earliest known human fossils by 85,000 years			0
this image shows a sample of @entity135 pointed artifacts exhibiting fractures indicative of weapons that would have been thrown			0

archaeologists unearthed the left arm bones at @entity188 - @entity187
a raised ridge on the upper - arm bone suggests some muscle damage
scientists claim injury may have been from repeatedly throwing spears
previously it was thought @entity9 used close - range weapons
a separate study earlier this year uncovered 80,000 - year - old spear tips
@entity203 believe they were created by ancestors to ancient humans
