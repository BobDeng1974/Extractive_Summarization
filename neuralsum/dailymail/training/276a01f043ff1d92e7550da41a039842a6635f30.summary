by @entity1 reporter @entity2 started out as a furniture salesman after graduating from college			1
however , he later changed his line of work and became one of the top cybercrime experts for the @entity9 @entity2 's world has expanded greatly since he stopped selling discount furniture to join the @entity9 1998			1
especially since he transferred from @entity12 , in 2005 to fill a vacancy in the @entity14 , @entity17 's field office 's cyber squad - which he now heads			0
since then , supervisory special agent @entity2 has been recognized as a foremost expert on cybercrime			1
his profile has risen even more since the @entity22 used @entity2 's sleuthing to bring two indictments with worldwide ramifications			2
in may , five @entity27 army intelligence officers were charged with stealing trade secrets from major manufacturers including @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
in june , a @entity34 man was charged with leading a ring that infected hundreds of thousands of computers with identity - thieving software , then using the stolen information to drain $ 100 million from bank accounts worldwide			0
@entity2 , 44 , said in april during an oral history interview for the @entity41 that he became a furniture salesman out of college because jobs were hard to come by then			1
he spent about five years in the business before joining the @entity9			1
' i was in private industry beforehand			0
but i 've kind of always liked computers , ' said @entity2			2
@entity2 chose to join the @entity14 cyber squad largely because of family considerations - he grew up in suburban @entity51 , @entity17 , the son of a steelworker			2
' it kind of looked like cyber was the wave of the future , ' @entity2 said			2
' the majority of all my computer training was just on - the - job training at the bureau			0
' since joining the @entity9 , @entity2 has accomplished important missions such as infiltrating the @entity63 , a online forum where criminals bought and sold fraudulent credit card information it has proved remarkably effective			1
even before the @entity27 and @entity34 cases made worldwide headlines , @entity2 was making cyber waves			1
he made his reputation infiltrating dark market in 2006			0
the worldwide internet forum allowed crooks to buy and sell stolen identity and credit card information			1
@entity2 infiltrated the network by pretending to be a notorious @entity79 computer hacker using the screen name ' @entity80 ' - a takeoff on the cartoon rat who guides the @entity84			1
@entity2 was inspired while watching the cartoon character with his young son : ' he 's a rat that lives underground			2
it was perfect , ' he said			0
@entity2 befriended the criminal mastermind behind the site and persuaded him to let @entity2 move the operation onto new computer servers			1
the servers happened to belong to the @entity9 , which led to more than 60 arrests worldwide			2
@entity96 , a @entity97 journalist who specializes in cybercrime , wrote a book about the case called ' @entity63 , how hackers became the @entity102			2
' ' @entity2 is not without technical ability , but his real talent lies in convincing experienced cybercriminals that he is one of them and not a law enforcement officer , ' said @entity96			2
his aw - shucks demeanor also makes him an ideal team player			0
' he has an understanding of the whole grid , and then he develops relationships , whether it 's with victims , the private sector , and our international partners , ' said @entity116 , the @entity117 attorney in @entity14			0
those partnerships are important because the @entity117 does n't have extradition treaties to bring the @entity27 and @entity34 suspects here for prosecution			0
those defendants could be arrested if they travel into areas that cooperate with the @entity117 , but @entity116 and @entity2 said that 's not the only purpose served by those indictments			0
a furniture showroom , the kind of place @entity2 used to work at before quitting and joining the @entity9 in 1998 ' the best result is to be able to get cuffs on a guy , ' @entity2 said			1
' but you have to measure how you can impact each ( criminal ) organization			0
' in the @entity34 case , @entity2 got a federal judge in @entity14 to allow the @entity22 to monitor some 350,000 computers infected with malicious software , so the thievery could be stopped			0
the @entity27 indictment , meanwhile , was a ' put up ' to the @entity27 government 's rumblings that the @entity117 government should " shut up " about ongoing cyberspying allegations unless they could be proved , @entity2 said			1
some cases produce a more tangible result			0
the @entity63 case led @entity2 to @entity148 , a @entity150 hacker whose home computer was found by the @entity9 with 1.8 million stolen credit card numbers on it			1
@entity148 , who changed his name to @entity155 , pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years in prison - the longest sentence yet handed down in a @entity117 hacking case			0
he was also ordered to repay banks $ 27.5 million , the cost of replacing all the cards he stole			0
' this was all just really organized crime with a computer , ' @entity2 said			1
' it 's traditional sleuthing but in a 21st - century way			0

@entity168 graduated college and became a discount furniture salesman , joining with the @entity9 in 1998
among his major accomplishments are infiltrating the @entity63 and *busting* @entity27 hacking
