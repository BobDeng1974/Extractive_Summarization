and he would certainly be toasting the fact that his new fragrance has sold the equivalent of 1,000 full martini glasses in the first days of its launch at @entity8			1
@entity9 for men - which should perhaps have been called @entity12 - is the official scent of the @entity9 franchise , and has been launched to mark @entity9 's 50th anniversary and the release of @entity18 ' new @entity9 epic , @entity19 , starring @entity20			1
when it launched there last week it outsold all new men 's and women 's scents , and the gift box has already completely sold out			1
the studded , rectangular bottle is equipped with a top secret swivel nozzle ( designed by @entity39 , we can only assume ) , and is available as a 30ml and @entity42 natural spray , priced at £ 19.50 and £ 24.50 respectively			2
the 007 @entity44 comes in 50ml only and is priced at £ 24.50			2

' it 's @entity55 gone a bit wrong - and it slightly reminds me of my dead granddad which quite unsettling			2
' bl ' it 's a cheeky little snifter , is n't it ? pretty fruity			0
very fruity , in fact			0
i would strongly advise against using too much			0
' @entity65 ' a powerful scent , might be better in small spritzes			0
rather reminiscent of cheaper alternative @entity68 , or maybe some kind of shower gel			0
not how i imagined @entity9 to smell but pleasant nonetheless			1
' @entity71 ' a light scent , ultimately inoffensive if used sparingly , but ' 007 ' has the potential to make your man smell like a teenage boy who 's been over-zealous with the cheap shower gel if sprayed too liberally			0
