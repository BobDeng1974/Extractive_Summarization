by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 20:35 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 14:26 est , 21 november 2012 police in @entity4 are questioning a person of interest dubbed ‘ @entity7 ' who has been linked to at least two of three deadly @entity9 shootings targeting businessmen of @entity12 descent			1
the balding , moustachioed man was taken in for questioning in the @entity9 neighborhood of @entity15 tuesday			1
deputy police commissioner @entity16 noted that at this time , the unnamed man is not under arrest and is not being called a suspect			1
he was later transferee to another police location for additional questioning			2
police have yet to release his name , but law enforcement sources said he is from @entity36 and is believed to be the man whose image was captured most clearly near the latest murder scene in @entity40			1
‘ we ’re talking to somebody who fits the description of the man in the ( video )			2
he came in voluntarily , ’ @entity41 said			2
three store owners have been killed in their shops over the past four months and the killings are connected as all three were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun			1
ballistics tests matched in each killing , all of which occurred in @entity9 shops with an ' 8 ' in the address			0
the latest suspect , ‘ @entity63 ’ , was caught on surveillance footage a block and a half away from the @entity40 store where @entity62 was killed on friday evening			2
minutes later , the same moustachioed - man is seen in a different video two blocks away from the store			2
murdered : @entity68 was killed with three gunshots , but it seems nothing was stolen the @entity72 reports that a different surveillance camera , located by the scene of the second murder in @entity76 also shows the same man			1
the video is of poorer quality , but they feel confident that the same duffle bag - toting man was in the area around the time that shopkeeper @entity83 was killed on august 2			2
‘ ” @entity63 ” wore a long overcoat and carried a duffel bag , ’ police commissioner @entity84 said			2
‘ he was seen in the vicinity of @entity62 ’s store just after 6 p.m. the shop owner ’s body was found at 7.11pm			2
’ this is not the first person - of - interest in the case , and a number have since been ruled out			0
previously unidentified suspects , dubbed ‘ @entity96 ’ and ‘ @entity97 ’ , were on the police ’s watch list since they were seen in the area of @entity62 ’s shop at the time of the murder			2
they have since been eliminated from the suspect pool as it turns out that ‘ @entity96 ’ stole a bottle of perfume from street vendor ‘ @entity97 ’ who was chasing after her following the theft			0
two remaining possibilities are ‘ @entity112 ’ , a woman who was seen near the crime scene wearing sunglasses and a scarf			0
looking for the man : he appeared near at least two of the three crime scenes over the past four months near the scene : none of the stores where the shootings took place had video cameras inside there also was a police sketch released following the first murder that took place earlier in the summer at a 99 cent store that left @entity131 dead on july 6			1
that possible suspect was a man with dark skin and wearing sunglasses , who witnesses described as being ‘ disturbed ’ and talking to himself about putting a bullet in someone ’s head			0
that man is said to be roughly 5 - foot - 5 and around 140 pounds			0
the @entity31 reports that the shop owner @entity142 was behind the counter of she she in @entity9 's @entity40 section when he was shot friday night			0
the gunman dragged the victim 's body toward the back of the store and covered it with clothing			0
victims : @entity83 and @entity131 were killed by the same handgun earlier this year police found the 78 - year - old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso , @entity154 reported			1
on the floor of the shop were the killer 's calling card : shell casings matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides			1
' now it 's like he 's telling us , ' it 's me again , '' a police source told the @entity31			0
casings that police have matched to two other murders			1
“ now it ’s like he ’s telling us , ‘ it ’s me again , ’ ” a police source said			0
the way @entity68 's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings			0
on july 6 , @entity131 , 65 , was found shot through the neck in his @entity15 clothing shop			1
his body was also hidden			0
police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies			1
' i hope they catch the son of a b * * * * , ' @entity131 's son , @entity193 said			0
when @entity200 did n't come home at the usual time friday his family called the police , who discovered his body			0
it was n't not clear if the killer actually took anything , or if the murder was his sole motivation			1
' he never had in his whole life one enemy , he did n't have , he was a very kind man , ' his sobbing wife , @entity209 , told reporters			0
suspect : following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun , police released this sketch of the suspect saturday he was supposed to be at his grandson ’s @entity220			0
police believe the murderer had been watching the store in preparation for the attack , noting that he 'd chosen a shop with no security cameras			1
@entity228 , 59 , was found dead in his @entity76 store at 1877 86th st. , was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck			0
besides owning stores , each victim was of @entity12 descent , prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated			1
it appeared nothing was taken from @entity68 's shop but both @entity239 and @entity131 had money taken from them , and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive			0
unguarded : believe the killer was attracted to the store because , as with previous crime scenes , there were no cameras @entity248 of the @entity249 of the @entity250 said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim 's description			1
' the only members that we would be concerned about are @entity12 , ' he said			2
it 's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology , as the address for each homicide includes the number 8 : @entity239 at 1877 86th st. , @entity131 at 7718 5th ave. , and @entity68 at 834 @entity268 none of the stores had working surveillance cameras			1
scene : police believe the killer may have been casing the shop , as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act neighbors called @entity200 a ' neighborhood staple			1
' ' he was a regular guy , ' said customer @entity281			0
' he never hurt nobody			0
' police are offering $ 12,000 for any information leading to the killer 's arrest and conviction			1
video : surveillance shows ' @entity7 ' near two different crime scenes			1

the man voluntarily entered a police station in @entity15 to be questioned by police
sources say he lives in @entity36
casings from the same .22 caliber handgun found at all three crime scenes
killer may have chosen stores based on lack of surveillance cameras
all three victims are @entity12 , prompting fears of racial motivation
police offering $ 12,000 *reward* for information
