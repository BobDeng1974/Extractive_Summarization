@entity0 and @entity1 are set to go head - to - head this summer to sign @entity3			1
the @entity5 midfielder has a £ 35million get - out clause in his contract , though changes to third party ownership could see his price drop by around £ 10m			2
however , the action between the two @entity14 giants could mean his value surpasses the £ 30m mark			2
@entity1 and @entity0 will go heafd - to - head to land @entity5 midfielder @entity3 the @entity18 international has a £ 35million get - out clause but his value could drop due to third party ownership @entity1 see @entity3 as the ideal player to replace the departing @entity23			1
equally , @entity0 have eyes for him to shore up a midfield which has lacked an enforcer this season			2
@entity28 are still confident of landing @entity29 this summer			2
the @entity31 midfielder is rated in the £ 25m category			2
his club @entity33 have offered him a new £ 60,000 - a - week deal to stay at the club			2
but the @entity36 will raise the bar on salary and more than likely offer @entity40 football			2
sources in @entity31 tell the @entity43 that @entity29 wants to join the @entity36			2
@entity33 midfielder @entity29 wants to join @entity28 according to @entity43 sources @entity46 ’s hopes of signing £ 60m - rated @entity47 from @entity48 could be dashed this summer because of the emerging interest of @entity50			1
president @entity51 is lining up an audacious move , despite the @entity54 giants ’ transfer ban			1
@entity50 are lining up an audacious move for @entity46 target @entity47 , currently with @entity48 @entity58 will move in for @entity59 should he - as it seems likely - leave @entity61 in the summer			1
whatever the outcome of their season it appears the @entity58 will part company with @entity67			1
the @entity43 understands @entity69 boss @entity68 is high on @entity61 ’s ‘ long list ’ , along with @entity71 and @entity72			1
@entity73 is set to leave @entity74 this summer			1
@entity75 and @entity76 are two possible destinations			0
@entity58 will make a move for @entity59 should the @entity61 boss leave @entity80 this summer i am hearing @entity82 will restore @entity83 to his favoured role of lead striker when @entity86 play @entity87 in the @entity89 qualifier at the end of the month			1
@entity83 has been moved around the @entity0 team this season , even playing deep in midfield under @entity93			0
but @entity82 still believes @entity83 ’s position is as a front man even though he has used him in differing roles			0
it remains to be seen though if @entity83 can justify his place in the national team and not just be picked because he is captain , especially given the emergence of @entity102 ’s @entity101 as a contender for the central striker role			0
indeed , suddenly @entity105 has plenty of options up front with @entity113 ’s @entity110 and @entity112 ’s @entity111 also candidates with @entity101 and @entity1 ’s @entity114 to challenge @entity83 for the ‘ no 9 ’ role			1
@entity82 will restore @entity83 to his favoured role of lead striker when @entity86 play @entity87 i am also hearing reports of a deep rift between @entity0 boss @entity93 and assistant @entity120 may be exaggerated but @entity43 hears there have been differences of opinion with regard to tactics , not least the use of @entity83			0
this time last year @entity43 reported that if @entity128 was ousted , @entity120 would take charge until the end of the season			0
@entity43 hears it ’s not beyond the realms of possibility that @entity120 will be @entity0 ’s next boss			0
how soon ? that depends on how @entity135 negotiates the remainder of this season			0
@entity120 , ( second left ) pictured next to @entity93 , could be @entity0 's next boss @entity139 the day after the @entity140 appointed @entity141 as their new chief executive , @entity82 announced he wanted his contract extended for at least two years to take in the 2018 @entity145 finals			2
it would seem @entity82 , or perhaps someone who advises him on @entity149 matters , thought it was good timing to state his case			0
whatever the reason it could well backfire on @entity82			0
@entity82 has announced he wants to extend his contract with @entity86 for at least another two years after all , on what grounds does @entity82 think he has earned the right to a new deal ? yes , @entity86 are well on the way to qualifying for the finals of @entity160 , but in a very weak group			0
and does he think people have forgotten last summer ’s lamentable display at the @entity145 ? @entity86 ’s dire performances in @entity165 encouraged scathing comments towards @entity82 from @entity168 's main man @entity167			2
and here ’s the thing			0
@entity171 is a pal of @entity141			0
why ? because @entity173 offered former @entity86 skipper @entity167 a lucrative career in advertising crisps			0
indeed , @entity167 lauded the appointment of @entity141			0
food industry boss @entity141 ( left , with @entity167 in 2000 ) has been named the @entity140 's new chief the only way @entity82 , who is 67 by the way , should continue as boss is if the team reach at least the semi-finals at the @entity185			2
of course the obvious question then is who to replace him			0
given his strong views on football over the last 20 years from the comfort of the pundit sofa after a great @entity194 career , it might just be that @entity141 persuades @entity167 to put his money where his mouth is			0
btw @entity1 boss @entity197 has suggested that @entity23 ’s ‘ dream ’ of leading out @entity1 in this year 's @entity200 final as a last hurrah before moving to @entity201 is not guaranteed			1
after all the @entity202 have got to get there first			0
sunday ’s quarter - final tie against @entity205 may seem a shoo - in for @entity1 but any manager tempts fate when they look too far ahead			1
that said , @entity1 look well placed to go all the way to @entity213 this season			1
@entity23 is back training but wo n't walk straight into the @entity1 team , according to @entity197 with @entity23 in mind , @entity197 was spot on when he said : ‘ no player has a @entity219 given right to walk into the team			1
’ indeed @entity1 have played their best football and have picked up points since @entity23 was ruled out of action with a hamstring injury			1
moreover , @entity1 ’s revival this season has coincided when @entity23 ended all the speculation about his future and said he would leave the club and join @entity201 in a sense that liberated the rest of the players … not least @entity233			1
@entity233 , pictured celebrating against @entity112 , has been liberated since @entity23 confirmed his move squads ca n’t live under the shadow of an ageing star			1
even that time will come for @entity50 and @entity239			1
there comes a point when even the best players , club legends , can end up overshadowing the squad and thus undermining the team evolving into a new era			0
@entity246 was a master at moving on stars and refreshing the team			0
and of course at @entity0 under sir @entity251 did the same			0
it would seem @entity197 realised that offering @entity23 two more years at @entity1 was more sentimental than pragmatic and thus detrimental to the club moving on up under his watch			1
that is a sign of good management and may in a few years time see @entity1 achieve what they never did in the ‘ @entity23 era ’			1
@entity197 says @entity23 does not have a god - given right to return to the team straight away @entity263 the @entity40 resumes this week			1
@entity264 are 8 - 1 to win the trophy			0
given the way the beat @entity61 1 - 0 last week when overrun in the second half suggest they have the mettle and desire and even the luck to go all the way			1
the @entity273 is on for the @entity274 .			0

@entity1 see @entity3 as a replacement for @entity23
@entity50 could *scupper* @entity46 's bid for @entity47
@entity58 will move for @entity59 should he leave @entity61
