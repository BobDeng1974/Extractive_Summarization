a pub landlord has been fined £ 15,000 for employing an ' illegal immigrant ' - despite the barman having a @entity4 mother and having lived in the @entity4 for more than 50 years			1
@entity5 , 50 , had been paying 56 - year old former postman @entity6 - a family friend over 30 years - to serve drinks and collect glasses at his @entity10 pub since 2009			1
but unknown to mr @entity5 , mr @entity6 had been living in the @entity4 ' illegally ' since 1962 as he was born in the @entity11 and moved to @entity4 with his @entity4 mother when he was just three			1
@entity6 , 56 , ( right ) has lived in @entity4 since he was three years old but could be now be deported after it emerged he does n't have @entity4 citizenship			1
his employer , landlord @entity5 ( right ) , has also been fined last december , eight immigration officers acting on an anonymous tip off swooped on mr @entity5 's pub the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity10 and arrested mr @entity6 as he was working behind the bar			1
father - of - three mr @entity6 , known to his friends as @entity24 , was warned he would be deported back to his birthplace , licensee mr @entity5 was meanwhile shocked to be issued with a @entity27 by immigration officials for ' employing an illegal immigrant '			1
the fine has since been reduced to £ 10,000 on appeal			0
mr @entity5 said : ' the whole thing is ridiculous but we do n't blame @entity24 for any of it			0
he has lived here for 53 years and worked and paid his taxes since he was a teenager			1
how anyone can brand him an illegal immigrant is beyond me			0
' it would be devastated for us as this bill could send us under but it is of course more devastating for @entity24 too if this all went through			0
his daughter was in here crying her eyes out the other day in the pub and he 's a loss as to what to do about it			2
' you hear stories of illegal immigrants being allowed to stay in the @entity4 under some crazy human rights law yet @entity24 who has been paying his taxes all his life has been told he has to go			1
there seems to be no common sense about it			0
mr @entity6 ( pictured in @entity61 aged six ) was born to a @entity4 mother and an @entity11 father in the @entity11 - but after his parents split up , his mother brought him back to the @entity4 now - 56 - year - old mr @entity6 ( pictured , centre , in @entity61 aged 10 ) has lived in @entity4 ever since mr @entity5 added : ' when you have known someone 30 years you do n't think they 're @entity11 or whatever country they come from			1
i just think it could have been totally avoided and handled in a different way by the @entity75 and whoever else			0
' this must have cost thousands already - even to send eight enforcement officers and lock him up overnight			2
' mr @entity6 had been born in 1959 as the son of an @entity11 soldier and a @entity4 ' gi bride '			1
but when his parents split up three years later , he and his mother moved back to her native @entity10			1
he was later given an @entity11 passport but did n't realise he needed @entity4 citizenship to stay in the @entity4			1
after previously working as a railway guard , he has been working in mr @entity5 's pub since 2009			1
mr @entity5 said : ' i had no knowledge at all of @entity24 's immigration status			2
it was just a bit of a joke between people that he had an @entity11 passport			1
' i have known him for 30 years and no - one ever thought anything of it			1
he explained he had an @entity11 passport because he was born over there and that 's it			1
he never applied for dual nationality because he did n't think he had to			0
' when he started working here we photocopied his @entity4 driving licence as photo id and had a @entity102 from his last job which had his national insurance number on			2
they were the only checks we thought we had to do			0
' he has been left facing potential deportation after immigration officials told him he has no right to live here his employer , pub landlord @entity5 , is furious after he was hit with a £ 10,000 bill for employing him mr @entity5 added : ' i was at the bank on the day @entity24 got arrested and got phonecall off immigration saying i needed to go back to the pub. ' when i got back there were eight immigration officers there and four of them were interviewing @entity24			1
they shut the pub because they said they had to secure the building then interviewed me			2
' they asked me how long he had worked there and it seemed we should have got a copy of his passport and a photocopy of his birth certificate			2
we thought we had done everything by the book			0
' they say they have reduced the fine from £ 15,000 to £ 10,000 because i have " co-operated " but i ca n't even afford to pay £ 10,000 - we are a small business			2
' @entity24 's worked for big international companies but it 's me getting the brunt			2
i said to the police ' what about fining @entity142 ? he worked there for 14 years '			2
they said it 's nothing to do with them it was me who was employing him at the time			0
' it 's just ridiculous			0
it 's pathetic when you realise he has paid all his taxes all these years and in two weeks time they could send him back to @entity11 where he does n't know anybody			1
' it 's unbelievable when you have known someone that long to hear them being called an illegal immigrant is bad enough but then to be accused of employing him as one is even worse			0
' the @entity75 has defended its actions insisting mr @entity6 should have sorted out his immigration status mr @entity6 now has to report regularly to an immigration centre in @entity168			0
he said : ' i have lived here nearly all my life			0
i went to school here , i 've worked here for 40 years - but now i 've been told i 've been working illegally all that time , even though i 've got a national insurance number and paid my taxes			1
' i 've not been sleeping or eating			0
every time i see my daughter she cries and that sets me off			0
' i thought it would be alright because i 've been married here , i 've got three kids and all my family are here			0
i did n't think it was going to get this serious			0
' i was only working part time at the pub anyway but @entity5 has had to let me go as he will get another fine if he keeps me on			0
' @entity75 officials said mr @entity6 was warned in 2007 he needed to apply for residency but he had failed to provide enough evidence			0
a @entity75 spokesman said : ' people born overseas to a @entity4 parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the @entity4 , and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions			1
' we are satisfied the penalty has been correctly issued to mr @entity5 as mr @entity6 has not currently or at the time of the visit established he had permission to work in the @entity4			2
' the matter of mr @entity6 having been employed by other organisations before taking up employment at the pub did not exempt mr @entity5 from complying with the requirement for employers to conduct right to work checks			0
