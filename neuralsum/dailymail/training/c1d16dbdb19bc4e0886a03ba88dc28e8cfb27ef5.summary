school staff contacted the boys ' parents at 10am , with @entity1 's mother , @entity41 , 46 , arranging for transport to take boys to the @entity10 out of hours health centre			1

ms @entity63 , a carer and cleaner , said : ' i could n't believe it when the school rang to say they were glued together and could i drop everything to go and get them			0
' i did n't believe what i was hearing at first			0
i thought surely not , but then when i saw them they were completely stuck together ! after trying to free the boys from each other with nail varnish remover , medical centre staff used the simple , old fashioned method of hot soapy water to do the trick ' i could n't get over it			1
i was saying to them , ' are you sure you 're not lying ? ' but they were n't			0
they could n't take their hands apart			0
' some girl had stuck some pink glue on one of their hands and then as lads do , messing about , they had an arm wrestle and the next thing you know they were stuck together			0
' my dad drove me to the school to get them and take them to the one life			0
i had to help them in the van and put the seat belt right across the pair of them because it was both of their right hands that were glued			0
' the mother - of - five said @entity1 has always been accident prone after splitting his chin open , breaking his heel and then his arm in separate incidents over the years			2
she added : ' the staff had a right laugh at them and they had to read to find out what would take it off			0
' then they put their hands in scalding hot water with soap for a good 30 minutes before they were eventually freed			1
' @entity122 , headteacher of @entity12 , said : ' two year 9 students had to be taken to the @entity124 on tuesday after their hands were glued together following a prank in school			2
' medical staff were able to free their hands and no injuries were sustained			2
the school dealt promptly with the incident and has taken appropriate action			0

a prank saw @entity1 , 13 , and @entity3 , 14 , stuck together
staff at their @entity10 school initially thought the boys were *joking*
but after they realised pair could not be freed , the friends were taken to a medical centre where they were freed using hot soapy water
