by @entity0 students at a top private school have produced a @entity5 - style leavers ' video - which even features @entity6			1
the hour - long film produced by students at @entity10 , north @entity7 includes a member of staff walking through the playground firing at pupils with a plastic machine gun			1
he wields the weapon as youngsters are seen running in horror - before another tutor pretends to be shot and drops down dead			0
the film gives an insight into the cultural reference points of today 's school leavers , with students featured cooking crystal meth in a nod to hit series @entity40 and twerking like controversial pop star @entity42			1
the video , which was posted on @entity44 three weeks ago , also features @entity6 , who gives an @entity46 - style analysis of the pupils ' performance			1
at the end of the video , @entity6 says : ' unbelievable , i expected better from @entity10			0
that video was complete and utter rubbish			0
good luck to all the @entity10 2014 leavers			0
and do n't quit your day job			0
' @entity58 , headmaster of £ 18,000 - a - year @entity10 , says the at - times violent film was made in a spirit of fun			1
he said : ' a leavers ' film without controversy would be like fish and chips without the salt and vinegar , and the annual question is whether this joke or that joke is , in fact , in bad taste			1
' the £ 18,000 - a - year school has defended itself against any accusations the video is in bad taste students scatter from the school 's playground as the teacher emerges with a gun in the film he denied claims that it referenced school massacres , added : ' i know that my leavers in 2014 would be genuinely upset if survivors of the tragic gun massacres in the @entity90 were affected by , or took offence at , this tongue - in - cheek scene			1
' [ it is ] modelled on an action film shoot - out where leavers , dressed as @entity96 , carry an injured and long - serving schoolmaster to the steps of the newly restored chapel where he mimes his last minutes			1
' in vying with their peers in other schools for a fraction of a moment of notoriety , or in framing an affectionate portrait of their school , all leavers run a risk			2
' on this occasion , i believe that the context makes it clear that this is not only tongue - in - cheek , and very @entity113 , but a reference to cinematic gun crime			0
' the 2014 leavers have not , consciously or otherwise , overlooked the seminal importance to society - and young people - of getting to grips with violence of any kind , especially that violence which has led to the tragic loss of life in schools			2
' a spokesman for the school added : ' @entity10 's @entity128 would like to apologise to @entity6			0
' he was asked as a personal favour by a parent of one of the leavers for a video message for this and he kindly sent this in good faith			2
@entity6 had n't seen the film as it was unfinished at the time			0
' the day - only school was established in the 16th century and past students include lawyer @entity140 , commentator @entity141 and cricketer @entity142			2
