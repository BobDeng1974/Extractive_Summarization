that 's part of his game			0
he thrives off that , ' @entity0 said of @entity17			1
' he really needs that to bring out the best in his performances			0
' the most important thing is to not get caught up in the way he plays			0

the @entity1 boss said : ' @entity6 have a slight advantage , because they were able to score an away goal			1
it 's up to us to try to do what @entity6 did in @entity84			1
' one of @entity6 's main threats is the fact they 're very good on the counter attack , so i do n't think we should go gung ho			2
' we have to attack and we need to score a goal , regardless of whether @entity6 get one or not			2
although injuries have hampered @entity21 's involvement , @entity0 is sure he will have an impact @entity95 defender @entity60 sports a black eye after contact with @entity98 last week ' i hope we do better than @entity6 did in the first leg			1
