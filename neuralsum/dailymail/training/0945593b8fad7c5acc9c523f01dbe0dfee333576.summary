by @entity0 @entity1 discovered she had a 2.5stone cyst while pregnant a ' miracle ' baby has survived despite his mother suffering from a two stone cyst while pregnant with him			1
doctors feared the huge growth could be cancerous and warned @entity1 it would kill her and her unborn son @entity11 if it burst			1
she had her partner @entity12 had been trying for a baby for 18 months and were delighted when they discovered ms @entity1 was pregnant last july			2
but a few weeks after the 12 week scan last september she experienced sharp , cramping pains down her left side			1
doctors discovered a small cyst and drained four litres of fluid from it , but just after her 20 week scan , ms @entity1 was recalled to hospital and told a huge second cyst had been found			1
she said : ' my consultant told me that there was debris inside this cyst and it could be cancerous , so they would have to operate to remove it			2
' they told me they were going to leave me until i was 25 weeks pregnant before they operated to give the baby the best chance of survival			1
' by this point i was in so much pain with the cyst because it was so heavy and they put me on painkillers			0
' they told me it was if i was carrying twins at 30 weeks , as the cyst had made me so much bigger than i should be at that stage of pregnancy			1
' however , it was only after they operated that we found out it was a lot worse than that			0
' i was absolutely huge and if the cyst had burst or ruptured , both me and the baby would have died			2
' ms @entity1 , 25 , was rushed to @entity58 in december as she struggled to breathe and had a temperature			2
she was losing blood internally , given an emergency transfusion and booked in for the emergency operation to remove the cyst			0
ms hill pregnant with the cyst ( left ) and after it was removed ( right )			2
doctors had warned it could rupture , killing her and her unborn child ms @entity1 underwent a three - and - a - half hour operation to drain 12 litres of fluid from it and , to her relief , no cancer was found			1
the cyst had not been a common ovarian one but developed inside her left fallopian tube , which had expanded massively as it had grown			0
ms @entity1 had regular scans to check on her baby as doctors feared that being so squashed by the cyst might have affected his growth but he seemed fine			1
@entity11 survived the surgery as he wriggled lower into his mother 's womb ms @entity1 added : ' once they removed the cyst , they removed my left fallopian tube as well			1
' the doctors told me : ' we do n't know how you survived			2
thankfully , there was no cancer			0
' ms @entity1 then continued with her pregnancy and three months after the operation , her son @entity11 was born slightly prematurely , but otherwise well			1
a month on , he is now doing well at home in @entity99 , @entity100			0
ms @entity1 , a clerical officer for the @entity101 , said : ' @entity11 is an absolute joy and we can not believe he is here after everything we have been through			1
' it is frightening to think that if the cyst had ruptured , both @entity11 and i could have died			1
' we experienced some very frightening times but now @entity11 is here , we are both so happy , as he is just so perfect			0
' @entity11 survived the surgery as he wriggled lower into her womb and ms @entity1 returned home after a few days in hospital			1
the couple faced further anguish after 30 weeks of pregnancy when a scan showed enlarged ventricles to the baby 's brain			1
ms @entity1 was referred to specialists in @entity122 who offered to test for @entity125 's syndrome			0
she said : ' we felt there was no point having the test , as it was not an issue			0
@entity11 was going to come anyway			0
' ms @entity1 went into hospital on march 24 to be induced , but doctors told her she had already started labour and she had to be sent for an emergency caesarean section			1
when she came round her first words were : ' is my baby alive ? ' and she was told that @entity11 was in intensive care			2
she said : ' once i came round , they took me up in my bed to see @entity11			0
he was all wired up and in an incubator			0
' after having the cyst removed , ms hill ( with partner @entity142 ) went on to have baby @entity11 slightly prematurely @entity11 , who was born on march 25 weighing 7lb 7oz , began gradually getting better , and after seven days in hospital he and his mother were allowed home			1
she said : ' @entity11 is now a month old and is doing really well			0
' he 's a perfect miracle and we are just amazed that he is here			0
we just keep looking at him and crying			0
' his father added : ' @entity11 is perfect			0
we just ca n't stop looking at him and checking on him			0
' @entity151 , clinical director of women 's health at @entity153 , said : ' a cyst that weighs more than two stone is certainly quite unusual and removing a large cyst during pregnancy can be a difficult operation			2
' we wish @entity1 , @entity11 and the family well for the future			2

@entity1 , 25 , was told at her 20 - week scan she had 2.5 stone cyst
doctors warned it could kill her and her unborn son @entity11 if it ruptured
had to wait until 25 weeks of pregnancy to have it removed *safely*
to her relief , the cyst - which just before being removed made her look 30 weeks pregnant with twins - was not cancerous
