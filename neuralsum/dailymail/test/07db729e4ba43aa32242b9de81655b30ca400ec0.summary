‘ i accept that my publication of the allegations on @entity7 and in a manner which is readily accessible to users constitutes a very serious libel			2
it has injured the reputation of the @entity26 and has caused them considerable embarrassment and distress			0
‘ it has damaged their reputation in business and it is considered to be grossly defamatory of the position of the @entity166 , within the football hierarchy and within the football community in general , as well as within the local community for it to be even suggested that either or both of the @entity26 were not only aware of such alleged activities but also that either or both of the @entity26 actually condoned them			0
