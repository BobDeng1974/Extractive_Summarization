by @entity0 - parkinson published : 08:20 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 09:43 est , 23 july 2012 as @entity2 makes its final preparations ahead of friday 's @entity5 opening ceremony , it appears that it 's not just humans getting into the @entity8 spirit			0
this set of guinea pigs show that they also want a piece of the action as they take to the track , field and pools for a funny calendar to celebrate the event			1
@entity20 created a calender called the ' @entity22 ' and shows what our furry friends would look like if they took part in sporting events			0
this picture shows @entity29 running over @entity30 and is taken from the calendar 's month of june hopefully @entity33 's @entity5 sailing team will fare better than these guinea pigs who feature for july passing the baton : these furry creatures , featuring in december , appear worn out as they take part in the @entity5 relay forget @entity41 the eel , we 've got @entity43 the squeel ( er ) featuring in the swimming for the month of may the side - splitting @entity8 2013 calendar features the furry creatures competing in major sports events including rowing , track cycling and javelin			1
they are also seen rowing , tackling the marathon and sprinting in a close - run relay race			0
and the competitive critters are n't afraid to get their paws wet in synchronised diving , swimming and open - water sailing			0
but animals lovers need not fear that the furry creatures were made to compete for real , the humorous calendar was created using clever image manipulation techniques			2
digital tricks allowed designers to make the guinea pigs appear to form sporty poses			1
@entity68 ? the calendar has been produced by @entity70 and includes this image of rowing guinea pigs in january @entity73 can be seen leading a group of track cyclists for the calendar 's month of march maybe he 's called @entity77 ? this guinea pig has a go at javelin for the month of october in fact , they were photographed in a comfortable studio for no more than five minutes at one time and with plenty of treats			1
the guinea pigs were loaned by a animal rescue centre and a trained handler was on hand to make sure the photoshoot stars were looked after			1
@entity92 , owner of publishers @entity93 , said : ' @entity8 is one of our most successful calendars			0
this year we have created a stunning array of guinea pig images , showing our little furry friends competing in all the major events			0
' we hired the guinea pigs from @entity102 in @entity103 in exchange for a donation			2
the owner of the rescue site handled the guinea pigs			2
' the Â£ 9.99 @entity8 2013 calendar is available now			0
a guinea performs a slam dunk during a game of basketball during the @entity8 for august rat - a - twirly : in april the calendar celebrates gymnastics ( left ) while september took a @entity118 twist with the guinea pigs performing in the diving discipline november seems to take a bit of a surrealist turn as this guinea pig takes to show jumping i guess it makes a change from a running wheel : for february these rodents took part in the hurdles			1

furry rodents put into humorous sporting positions to celebrate @entity5
no animals were hurt in the making of this 2013 calendar
designers used digital tricks to make the guinea pigs look like *athletes*
