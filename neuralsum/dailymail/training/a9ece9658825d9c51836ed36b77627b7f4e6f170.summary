@entity0 told senators through tears on wednesday that she was choked and raped on a @entity4 cruise by one of the line 's employees working as a security guard			1
she was using her experience to shed light on the dangers that passengers might face on cruises			2
' @entity19 consumers have virtually no rights or protections , ' @entity0 , a resident of @entity14 , @entity15 , said during a @entity21 hearing in which witnesses called for more passenger protections on cruise liners			1
' i know this first - hand			1
' @entity0 said she was hurt and humiliated during the 2006 incident when staff members were slow and discourteous in helping her			1
the crew member was working as a security guard at the disco on the ship			2
' he approached me and asked me my name and cabin number			2
he later snuck down to my cabin and forced his way in			2
' i resisted and struggled			0
he strangled me and brutally raped me			1
i awoke with marksaround my neck			0
' there were no police on the ship and i was hesitant to report the crime because he wore a security badge			0
' after telling authorities , they made her collect evidence in trash bags and did n't take her to the infirmary immediately , administer anti-retroviral medications or give her another cabin in which to stay during the cruise to @entity40			1
even after an @entity69 investigation when the ship docked in the @entity67 , her rapist was never arrested or tried in the @entity67 , @entity0 said			1
sen. @entity70 , @entity71 , the committee chairman , said @entity0 's experience and other horror stories recounted at the hearing point to a lack of oversight and accountability for passenger safety in the cruise industry			1
' in spite of the evidence that crimes , fires , mechanical failures , drownings and mishandled medical emergencies occur with disturbing regularity on cruise ships , the industry continues to deny that it has a problem , ' @entity70 said			1

the hearing wednesday was the second he has called to raise awareness of the problems and how his bill could address them			0
while cruise line officials appeared at the earlier hearing , no industry representatives were present for wednesday 's session			1
@entity70 repeated throughout the hearing that the majority of people who take cruises have a good and safe time , but he added that even those relatively rare occurrences of passenger peril drive home the necessity of putting more protections into place			2
@entity116 , a @entity117 - based civil trial lawyer who has litigated cruise liner cases , said significant improvements in passenger safety are needed			1
@entity116 said that one of his clients was a 15 - year - old girl with asperger syndrome who was raped by a juvenile and an adult while on a holiday cruise in the @entity128			1
her mother believed that teen activities would be supervised by cruise staff as suggested by promotional material , he said			2

they 're not , ' he said			0
the @entity143 ( pictured ) cruise ship lost propulsion after an engine room fire in 2013 and was adrift off southern @entity40 's @entity147 peninsula another witness , @entity148 of @entity149 , said she was a passenger on the @entity143 in 2013 when it lost power in the @entity152 after an engine room fire that disabled basic systems including water and sewage			1
she described how feces in red biohazard bags lined the hallway , a ' tent city ' appearing on the deck to shield passengers from the sun , and sewage coming up through the shower drains			0
@entity148 said she was scared that fights would break out on the ship as food hording became common and the stench became worse			0
there was little to no direction from staff , she said			0
' it was soon very clear that @entity174 had no plan in place for such a disaster , ' she said			0
' they were essentially winging it			0
' committee members said cruises need to make it clear to passengers before they buy their tickets what rights they have onboard and what rights they are giving up			0
they also need to make more clear how safe cruises actually are , they said			0
last august , major cruise liners began voluntarily posting crime data online amid pressure from @entity192 and victims for more transparency			2
but the panelists and committee members said it was n't enough			0
the @entity198 generally does not identify victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly .			0
