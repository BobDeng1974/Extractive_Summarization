as a veteran she is entitled to use reserved parking spots at her local grocery store she returned to her car after a routine trip to the @entity39 in @entity17 , @entity7 , to find a note criticizing her use of the reserved veterans ' parking spot signed simply ' @entity26 ' ‘ the first thing i felt was confusion that there was a mistake , and that i had to talk to this person and ask them why they were so quick to assume i was n't a veteran and that i was taking privileges that did n't belong to me , ’ she told @entity44			1

@entity27 waited by the car in the hope that the note 's author would appear and she could confront them about the assumption that she was not a veteran			1
unfortunately they did not return ‘ i think they took one look at me when i got out of my car and saw that i was a woman and assumed i was n't a veteran and assumed i had n't served my country			1
