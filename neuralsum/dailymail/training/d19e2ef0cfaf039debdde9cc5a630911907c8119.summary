by @entity0 as @entity3 cultural icons go , @entity1 was one of the biggest , and certainly the loudest			1
his dj contemporary @entity4 looked and sounded like the deceitful , dangerous weasel that he was			1
@entity1 , on the other hand , was the big , genial , self - proclaimed ‘ @entity7 ’ , a huge personality who in his 1970s and 1980s heyday made millions of loyal female fans feel that he was the kind of man they would turn to in a crisis			1
@entity1 was the self - proclaimed ' @entity7 ' , a huge personality who , in the 1970s and 1980s made millions of female fans			1
he is pictured here in 2006 with @entity20 and paedophile @entity4 perhaps even the sort of crisis when a woman realises the attentions of a man have become predatory , and she could do with some help			1
none of these fans would have believed then that decades later he would be charged with being one of those predators , surely not dlt who liked to say , ‘ everyone treats me as a friend in the home ’			2
@entity1 was one of those @entity3 superstars – and in his day there were many – who attracted young girls like iron filings to a magnet			1
his wife @entity43 accepted that he was a flirt , that his style was tactile			1
for decades as a @entity47 institution , and on the television , the bushy - bearded @entity4 was cheery , loud , and zany			1
for his early - morning show he adapted his nickname to the ‘ @entity1 ’			1
what other @entity4 would have introduced the puzzling concept of snooker and darts competitions on a radio show ? he was always publicly opinionated on his shows , and continued to be so			1
in recent years , after the @entity56 scandal led to celebrity arrests , he demanded indignantly : ‘ why ca n’t we list the names and addresses of all the paedophiles they ’ve got ? ’ @entity63 and his wife @entity43 leaving @entity65 after being found not guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault @entity1 carrying his wife @entity43 on their wedding day in 1971 when they were both @entity71 , @entity1 , now 68 , would sometimes join @entity56 at parties			1
he admitted he knew of @entity4 ’s reputation with young girls			1
by young , he added , he meant girls who were 16 , 17 or 18			2
but he told the police after he himself was arrested : ‘ if i knew at that time that @entity4 was a paedophile i would be the first one to get him arrested because it ’s the worst crime in the world as far as i ’m concerned			1
’ one of his accusers , now a mother of two , who alleged he assaulted her in an empty studio when she was 17 , told the jury : ‘ these djs were big , big stars			2
they were like pop stars			2
there would be crowds of people hanging around outside the building to see them			0
they were like demi - gods			0
’ no one has suffered heavier blows since @entity1 was arrested in november 2012 than his blonde @entity94 wife , @entity43 , whom he married 43 years ago			1
she is a small and rather quiet woman described by acquaintances as ‘ very sweet and very patient ’ , and there she was yesterday – as her husband was told he was free to go after almost a month in the dock – calmly brushing a speck of dust from the lapel of his jacket			0
one of @entity1 's accusers said he and other djs of the era were ' big , big stars '			1
she told the jury : ' they were like demi - gods ' @entity1 's wife @entity43 has been described by acquaintances as being ' very sweet and very patient ' @entity43 has had breast cancer , from which she is recovering			1
and she has lost the lovely rambling £ 1.8 million @entity114 farmhouse where they lived for many years – it had to be sold to pay for her husband ’s legal defence			0
home is now a modest cottage into which they moved before the trial began			0
selling the house meant removing @entity1 ’s large , semi-nude photographs of women on the walls of the kitchen , as well as the sculpture of the lower half of a woman wearing just a thong that stood by the fridge			1
it meant dismantling the unique library that @entity1 – ‘ a permanent adolescent ’ according to one friend – kept in the downstairs loo			1
the books were all about flatulence			0
unlike the family of @entity139 , who was acquitted of sexual charges last week , childless @entity43 had kept away from the trial until monday , when the jury retired to consider its verdicts			1
‘ @entity43 has a rare tolerance , ’ says a family friend , ‘ never seeming to be bothered by his inveterate flirting with young women			1
‘ she was cool about his fame when he became a bigger star than he had ever thought possible on @entity151 and @entity47			0
‘ and when his career was on the wane , she persuaded him to accept it with grace , saying that he ’d had a good innings			0
i would say @entity1 is a very lucky man where @entity43 is concerned			1
’ @entity43 even sometimes assisted his lifelong hobby of photography			1
those huge photographs in the kitchen were his work			0
his subjects , he explained in court , could be a girl he spotted in the pub or walking in the street			0
he said he would hand them a card so that they could contact him later to arrange a shoot , but only after they had asked their parents ’ permission			0
he has taken lots of photographs of woman naked and semi-naked , but insisted they were not ‘ tacky ’			0
he once persuaded a woman to get her clothes off for a nude shoot after meeting her in the park and telling her he was impressed by a large tattoo on her back			0
‘ women just have such fabulous shapes and i wanted to utilise those shapes , ’ he declared			0
did @entity43 really approve of the photography ? ‘ it ’s fine , ’ she told a visiting interviewer			1
‘ only fine ? ’ interjected @entity1 during the interview			1
‘ it ’s great , ’ said @entity43 , correcting herself ‘			1
i do n’t know what you want me to say			0
’ ‘ the secret of a happy marriage , ’ @entity1 told the interviewer , grinning and putting both hands on her knee in full view of his wife , ‘ is never look at another women or touch her knees ! that ’s the secret of a happy marriage			1
’ was he always that flirty , the interviewer asked @entity43			2
‘ oh , yes , ’ came the reply			0
one has to wonder how different things would have been if @entity1 had remained plain @entity213 , born in @entity214 , @entity215 , the son of a stage manager ; and if he had stuck to his first job of graphic designer and not felt the pull of the nightlife and excitement of being a dj. once the boy from @entity226 – then a direct grant grammar but now one of our leading private schools – realised it was what he wanted , there was no stopping him			2
the couple 's former home near @entity235			2
they have sold the £ 1.8million farmhouse to pay for @entity1 's defence home is now a small bungalow in @entity114 , a sharp contrast to the sprawling farmhouse the couple had to give up to pay @entity1 's legal fees from part time @entity4 - ing at @entity248 ’s @entity247 club as a 20 - year - old ( playing the music on his own @entity252 record player ) he moved in 1965 to the original pirate radio station , @entity254 , broadcasting from off the @entity256 coast and the @entity257			1
two years later , the @entity3 launched the new pop station @entity47 , and beckoned in his direction			0
it was the start of 25 years with the @entity3 during which he became a household name			0
in 1978 , he became @entity263 host when he took over from @entity264			0
at his peak he had nine million listeners			0
by now his face , along with that megawatt voice , was familiar to millions because he was a regular host on @entity151 , gold bracelets and pendant necklaces jangling , and always surrounded by waves of excited , star - struck young girls			0
‘ an ego trip , ’ he admitted			0
‘ i love people to come up and greet me with a “ @entity276 , @entity1 , how y’doin ”			2
’ in 1980 , the @entity277 named @entity278 ’			0
in 1992 , the pipe - smoking dj was made @entity280			0
but then in 1993 , he suddenly resigned from the @entity3 – on air			0
‘ changes are being made here which go against my principles , and i just can not agree with them , ’ he announced to startled listeners			0
the reality was that @entity47 had a new controller who wanted to bring in new voices , and @entity1 ’s contract had only ten weeks to run			2
he knew his time was up			0
@entity1 pictured speaking outside @entity65 today told reporters he has been through a ' year and a half of hell ' the veteran @entity4 claimed he had faced a ' trial by media ' during the proceedings			1
he said he was ' not delighted at all ' by the mixed verdict since then he has worked for minor stations such as @entity302 , @entity303 and @entity305 ’s @entity304			2
most recently , @entity1 was broadcasting each weekend from his own studio in his home for @entity308 , going out to eight radio stations in the @entity310			2
he also presented a music request programme called a @entity312 on the @entity313 with upwards of 40 million listeners round the world			0
one letter from @entity318 addressed simply ‘ @entity1 , @entity320 ’ , arrived safely on his desk			2
another fan was @entity322 pro-democracy leader and @entity324 winner @entity323 , who revealed after being freed from 15 years of house arrest that listening to his show had made her world ‘ much more complete ’			0
the job did n’t pay anything like the big money he used to earn , of course , but almost 50 years after he started out as a @entity4 , he was at least working			2
and the @entity1 could still lay claim to playing a key role in a golden era of @entity336 broadcasting , a time of family programmes , an age we still like to describe as innocent			2

@entity1 's wife @entity43 described as having a ' rare tolerance ' by a friend
he was known for his *flirtatious* and tactile nature
veteran @entity4 is referred to as a ' permanent adolescent ' by another friend
@entity1 was acquitted on 12 of 14 sex assault charges
the jury could not reach a verdict on an indecent assault charge and another of sexual assault
