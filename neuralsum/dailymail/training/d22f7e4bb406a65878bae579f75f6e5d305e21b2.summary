by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 3 october 2013 a reckless garage worker caught driving a work mercedes along a dual carriageway with his bonnet up so he could charge its battery has been suspended			1
the unnamed motorist sped along at 50mph in @entity9 with almost no view of the road through the windscreen			1
the video has gone viral and was seen by the boss of @entity17 's @entity16 dealership who realised it was one of his vehicles , being driven by a member of his staff			1
footage showed the man had the bonnet up to allow for a battery booster pack to connect to the engine , leaving a tiny gap for him to look through			1
@entity46 , group operations director at @entity47 in @entity17 , today confirmed that the driver of the @entity16 had been suspended			1
he said : ' we were all shocked to see the footage which showed a member of my staff driving a car with the bonnet open			1
' we investigated what happened straight away , and the person driving the car has been suspended from work whilst we look into the facts			1
' everyone who works at all of our sites is fully aware of the importance of working safely , either on the road or at a dealership			0
' we have never seen anything like this before , and we will make sure that it wo n't happen again			0
' crazy : this close up from the video shows just how little view the driver will have had turning off : after running along the main road the driver calmly pulled down a side road and out of sight @entity76 , 42 , was a passenger in a passing car and took footage on his iphone			1
mr @entity76 , a @entity80 presenter , said : ' we had just left the @entity83 motorway and the guy was driving in the same direction as us but i ca n't believe he would have driven like that on a motorway			2
' i could n't believe what i was seeing so that was why i took my phone out and recorded it			0
' it was crazy and beggars belief			0
' the guy was alone in the car and was wearing glasses but he did n't appear to be bent over to look through the gap in the bonnet , he was just sat up normally			2
' even when he saw that i was filming him he did n't slow down or stop , he just carried on regardless			0
' it is unclear how far the driver intended to travel with the bonnet in the precarious position			2
@entity104 , head of roads policy at the @entity106 , said he had never seen anything like it			0
he said : ' it 's a very bizarre and dangerous thing to do , it is completely mad			1
' the driver was just asking to be stopped by police and not only that , i 'm surprised no body was hurt			2
' it defies all logic and no one in their right mind would do it , i 've never seen anything like this before and thankfully incidents such as this are very rare			0
' what you would normally do is put the battery pack on the passenger seat and use wires to attach it to the engine , with the bonnet closed			0
' but this was something else , it was just pure laziness			0
' mr @entity76 has contacted the police and has sent them the short video footage of the offending light blue @entity16			0
