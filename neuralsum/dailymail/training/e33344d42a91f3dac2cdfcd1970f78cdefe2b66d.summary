by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:45 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 20:50 est , 2 march 2013 @entity2 invoked the vision of @entity5 ’s favourite political guru yesterday in an attempt to fight back from the shattering @entity8 defeat in the @entity9 by - election			1
he refused to ‘ tack right ’ , but said he would pursue ‘ common ground ’ policies on welfare , immigration , the @entity14 and crime to woo ordinary voters			1
the prime minister ’s ‘ common ground ’ theme is a tribute to one of mr @entity2 ’s @entity8 heroes , sir @entity21			1
inspiration : @entity2 with @entity5 in 2007 sir @entity21 was the intellectual driving force behind @entity26 , but was nicknamed ‘ the mad monk ’ by left - wing critics for his ascetic manner and some of his more controversial views			1
mr @entity2 ’s response to the @entity9 result , where the @entity8 finished third behind the @entity33 and @entity34 , came as : mr @entity2 ’s vow to stay on the ‘ common ground ’ followed pressure from @entity8 right - wingers to take a tougher stance on @entity40 and other issues to counter the @entity34 threat			1
his refusal to ‘ tack right ’ is a clear message that he will not abandon policies such as gay marriage , which have enraged his right wing			0
but by praising sir @entity21 , he is trying to convince activists that he has not renounced the party ’s @entity50 heritage			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ we are engaged in a battle for @entity55 ’s future ... it is a battle we will only win if we reject the cynicism , the political calculation and the easy ways out – and stick to the course we are on			2
‘ the right thing to do is to address the things people care about – to fix yourself firmly in what @entity21 called the “ common ground ” of politics			1
’ a no 10 source said : ‘ we have shown we can occupy that ground by cutting immigration by a third , introducing a welfare cap and imposing a tough but fair criminal justice policy			0
' but it is not just as an appeal to the @entity75 – we will continue to ring - fence health spending			0
' and we are taking the right decisions on the number one issue facing the country – the economy			0
these are all common ground issues			2
@entity83 are n’t there at all			0
’ sir @entity21 was the intellectual driving force behind @entity26 sir @entity21 , who is regarded as one of the chief architects of @entity26 , believed that the out - of - touch political elite had to find ‘ common ground ’ with ordinary voters			1
he was widely acclaimed for his brilliance and sincerity , but admitted that he lacked the judgment , personality or stamina to be leader			0
he was a candidate to succeed @entity98 in the 1974 @entity8 leadership election – until he gave a speech in which he argued the poor should not have more than two children per family			0
he said the ‘ balance of our population , our human stock ’ was ‘ threatened ’ by the higher number of children in poorer families			0
after being accused of advocating selective breeding , or eugenics , he withdrew from the race , and backed @entity5 instead			0
sir @entity21 later said it would have been ‘ a disaster for the party , country and me ’ if he had become leader			1
in 1981 , he clashed with @entity118 by opposing plans to rebuild recession - hit @entity120 and suggesting a ‘ managed run - down ’ of the area instead			0
sir @entity21 , who died in 1994 , held three @entity124 posts			2
his political soul mate @entity5 said the two politicians who had most influence on her were sir @entity21 and the equally controversial @entity128 , both of whom she called ‘ very great men ’			1
triumphant mr @entity131 used his party ’s stunning second place finish in @entity9 to reveal that he intended to go one better by winning a by - election in his own right before the next election			1
he told @entity138 that if another by - election occured in the immediate run - up to 2015 , he intended to stand			0
mr @entity131 ’s allies say he ‘ bitterly regrets ’ not standing in @entity9			1
many commentators believe his popularity would have enabled him to win it			0
@entity131 , with @entity34 candidate @entity145 , is said to regret not standing for the seat himself mr @entity131 said : ‘ i would certainly consider standing in a by - election once the @entity149 elections in 2014 are out of the way			1
’ he also launched a new personal attack on ‘ dishonest ’ @entity2 , stating : ‘ the aspirational classes who supported @entity5 wo n’t touch @entity2 with a bargepole because we are the only party who want to take those on a minimum wage out of paying tax altogether and who know bright children from poorer backgrounds will benefit hugely from more grammar schools			2
‘ if @entity2 thinks that printing leaflets in @entity34 colours , as they did in @entity9 , will bring him votes then he ’s wrong – all it does is highlight the @entity169 ’ dishonesty			2
’ a confidant of mr @entity2 said : ‘ it is high time @entity131 ’s fantasy politics and economics of the mad house are exposed			1
' just because you smoke and drink pints at 11am does not make you a good leader			0
when @entity34 is subjected to scrutiny , they will crumble			0

@entity2 said he will pursue ' common ground ' policies to woo voters
sir @entity21 was the intellectual driving force behind @entity26
he believed the political elite needed to be in touch with ' ordinary ' voters
@entity34 leader @entity131 said he planned to become an mp before the 2015 election .
senior ministers said it was time to ‘ take the gloves ’ off over populist mr @entity131 and hit back hard following his ‘ conman ’ jibe at the prime minister .
