by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 09:29 est , 28 october 2013 it may seem some people are just naturally better at word games than others , but it 's not all down to luck - there are some tricks you can use to steal points from your opponents			2
according to @entity17 @entity16 expert and countdown champion @entity18 , there are at least 100 different tips players can use to win , or at least boost their overall score			1
these include how to remember unusual words , why two - letter words , especially involving the ' x ' tile , are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns , which are usually banned			0
according to @entity17 @entity16 expert @entity18 , there are at least 100 different ways players can win , or at least boost their score			1
these include how to remember unusual words , why two - letter words are so important and when it is acceptable to use proper nouns @entity18 suggests the more words in a person 's vocabulary , the better , and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most in @entity16			1
for example : @entity39 - an epic poem psst - a word used to capture someone 's attention inconspicuously brrr - used to signify being cold @entity18 - another word for a blunder @entity46 - cry of @entity48 frenzy @entity49 - a variant spelling of the word khat , which is an evergreen shrub @entity52 - a monetary unit in @entity54 in his book , 101 ways to win at @entity16 , @entity18 explains that although proper nouns are n't generally accepted , there are some exceptions			1
for example , his own name @entity18 can be used as another word for a blunder or mistake			2
equally ' danny ' and plural ' dannies ' , is acceptable to describe a child 's hand			0
elsewhere in his book , @entity18 explains that two - letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game , but they can also be used to connect words			1
he goes on to say the ' x ' tile , worth eight points in the game , either preceded or succeeded by a vowel gives a high - scoring combination for a low number of tiles used			1
these include ' ax ' , ' ex ' , ' xi ' and ' xu '			0
many dictionaries now have a page detailing all the accepted two - letter words , described as the ' glue ' of @entity16 including jo , es and ta			2
equally , there are a host of three - letter words , such as iff , roc , and ulu that can be useful			0
@entity18 's book adds that there are a handful of four - letter words that do n't contain any vowels that are also accepted in @entity16			1
these include psst , pfft , brrr and grrl - although @entity18 points out that only these spellings are accepted , and extra ' @entity105 's , ' @entity104 's and 's ' ca n't be added			2
another way to steal points from the words already placed on the board by opponents , as listed in @entity18 's book , is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes			1
these included ' ed ' , ' ing ' and adding the letter s to the end of words , yet @entity18 adds the suffix ' ish ' is rare and equally effective , especially on words such as pixyish			2
elsewhere in his book , @entity18 explains two - letter words are important because they can be used to get rid of tiles towards the end of the game , and to connect other words			1
described as the ' glue ' of @entity16 , these include jo , es and ta			0
equally , three - letter words , such as iff , roc , and ulu can be useful the letter 's ' and the blank tile should be used sparingly , according to @entity18 's book			1
an s , for example , should only be used when adding it increases the overall score by around five points , otherwise it 's a ' waste '			0
another key thing to remember is that the letter ' q ' does n't always need to be followed by a ' @entity147 '			0
in the two - letter list the word @entity149 is ' a variant of chi '			0
while @entity153 ( a variant spelling of the word khat ; an evergreen shrub ) , @entity157 ( a @entity159 chief ) and sheqalim ( the plural of sheqel , the currency of @entity163 ) are examples of longer words where this technique can be used			0
@entity18 suggests the more words in a person 's vocabulary , the better they are at @entity16 , and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most			1
he does n't insist players learn the dictionary , but it is worthwhile familiarising themselves with some of these unusual words , or words that use unusual letter combinations including epopoeia , an epic poem , and tchick , a clicking sound			0
for words that are difficult to spell , @entity18 suggests creating a mnemonic to help players remember them , such as ' @entity185 ' for the word jiao , a monetary unit in @entity54			2
ultimately , @entity18 claims that sometimes tiles need to be swapped , which means that player misses a go , but they may get a better selection of letters and a higher score as a result			0
the @entity197 final takes place on sunday .			0
