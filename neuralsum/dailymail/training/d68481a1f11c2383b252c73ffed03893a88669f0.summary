at school , most of us learnt that the @entity4 ’s tectonic plates ‘ float ’ like large rocky rafts			1
but teachers were vague about what the pieces of @entity4 ’s crust actually float on because no one really @entity11 scientists have solved the mystery , however			0
geologists have used tonnes of dynamite , creating their own seismic waves , to discover that the plates move across a thick layer of jelly - like rock			1
geologists have used tonnes of dynamite to create their own seismic waves and discover that tectonic plates move across a thick layer of jelly - like rock			1
here , instruments are used to measure the waves together with experts from the @entity28 and @entity29 , a team of geologists from @entity32 , in @entity33 , developed a new method to get the most detailed images yet of the base of the tectonic plate beneath @entity38			2
in the past , geologists have studied earthquakes and the speed of the seismic waves produced , in a bid to unravel the mystery			1
‘ rather than relying on earthquake waves that come from below we create our own " earthquakes " with dynamite shots , ’ study leader @entity44 told @entity45			1
the team detonated dynamite underground across the southern part of the @entity53 and listened for echoes to build an image of the bottom of the @entity57 , which is 62 miles ( 100km ) beneath the @entity4 ’s surface			1
they used 877 @entity61 can - sized seismometers set up over 52 miles ( 85km ) to take their measurements			0
experts already knew that plates are made of a thick layer of hard rock , called the lithosphere , above a softer layer called the asthenosphere ( shown in this diagram ) , but the boundary between them was a mystery in the past , geologists have studied earthquakes and the speed of the seismic waves produced , in a bid to unravel the mystery			1
this stock image shows seismic waves created by a small earthquake experts already knew that plates are made of a thick layer of hard rock , called the lithosphere , above a softer layer called the asthenosphere , but the boundary was a mystery			1
the recordings were clearer than before and showed that @entity4 ’s tectonic plates are gliding on a distinct layer of ‘ soft ’ rock , six miles ( 10km ) thick and weak enough to allow the plates to shift many centimetres per year			1
the study revealed that the @entity4 ’s tectonic plates are gliding on a distinct layer of ‘ soft ’ rock , six miles ( 10km ) thick			1
it is weak enough to allow the plates to shift many centimetres per year			2
the thinner layer beneath the plate appears to contain pockets of molten rock that make it easier for the plates to slide across them			2
this means that the plates can be pushed and pulled around without strong resistance at the base			0
professor @entity44 said : ‘ a weak slippery base also explains why tectonic plates can sometimes abruptly change the direction in which they ’re slipping			1
it ’s a bit like a ski sliding on snow			0
’ the rock may be soft because of a higher concentration of water or magma than in rock in the lithosphere , which is 0.1 per cent magma			2
the experts say that if the rock was made of just 2 per cent magma , it may explain its unusual consistency			0
‘ the idea that @entity4 ’s surface consists of a mosaic of moving plates is a well - established scientific paradigm , but it had never been clear about what actually moves the plates around , ’ said professor @entity44 of the university ’s geography department			1
‘ to work this out requires an understanding of what happens at the bottom of a tectonic plate			0
it ’s been difficult to obtain the necessary detailed images at such great depths using the usual method of recording natural earthquake waves			0
‘ but by generating our own seismic waves using higher frequency dynamite shots we were able to see how they became modified as they passed through different layers in the earth			1
‘ this , along with some new techniques in seismic reflection processing , allowed us to obtain the most detailed image yet of an oceanic tectonic plate			0

’ the rock may be soft and jelly - like because of a higher concentration of water or magma than in rock in the lithosphere , which is 0.1 per cent magma			0
the experts say that if the rock was made of just 2 per cent magma , it may explain its unusual consistency			0
‘ on a million - year time scale this would appear weak and jelly - like , ’ professor @entity44 said			0
he said that understanding the boundary between the base of cold , rigid tectonic plates and the underlying hot mantle underneath is central to our knowledge of plate tectonics , as well as the very formation and evolution of our planet			1
researchers say weak zones caused the @entity4 's mantle to crack , causing tectonic plates to form they are responsible for the formation of continents , and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show			1
however , researchers have never been able to work out why the @entity4 developed tectonic plates , but other planets did not			2
on april , @entity216 said it had solved the mystery - and say the key is tiny minerals within rocks			0
the research suggests how and when @entity4 came to develop one of its most distinct features — rigid tectonic plates — and why @entity225 , @entity4 ’s twin - like neighbor , never has			2
' we think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks , ' said @entity216 geophysicist @entity232 , lead author of research published online april 6 in the journal @entity235			0
the researchers argue that in @entity4 ’s early days , mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere - the outermost shell of the planet			0
these zones persisted , developed into plate boundaries , and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates			2
the weak zones , they argue , resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms .			0

geologists used dynamite to create their own seismic waves
waves enabled them to get a clear picture of the bottom of the @entity57
this revealed tectonic plates are gliding on a layer of ‘ soft ’ rock ,
it is six miles ( 10km ) thick and weak enough to allow the plates to shift
find could shed light the formation and evolution of our planet
