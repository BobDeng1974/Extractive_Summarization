@entity0 is confident that @entity1 have a team good enough to win the quadruple this season there are a number of first - team players yet to experience winning a trophy at @entity1 , including @entity0 ' now we are in the semi-final of the @entity8 , are top of the league , there is an important game in the @entity9 on saturday which we have to win and soon we will be playing @entity29 in the @entity10			1
' it will be hard but we have the team that can win everything			0
it 's what we 're aiming for			0
' there are players in @entity1 's squad who have never won a trophy in west @entity39 , @entity0 included			2

that starts in the @entity8 to the last game in the @entity10			0
@entity7 did not win a trophy in his first season back at @entity55 , but could put that right this season @entity1 's last trophy came under @entity58 when they won the @entity59 in may 2013 ' we want to win everything , it will be difficult , but i think we have the team to do it			2
hopefully we can achieve it			0
' @entity1 's next test on the road to quadruple success comes against @entity69 on saturday ; on paper , one of the easier ties they will face in the second half of the season			1
indeed , @entity29 are their opponents in the next stage of the @entity10			0
a 1 - 1 draw in the semi-final first leg of the @entity8 at @entity80 on tuesday night gave the @entity82 confidence that they will be able to take @entity83 back to @entity39 next week and beat them			1
@entity41 has been one of @entity1 's main men this season and leads the @entity11 scoring charts if @entity1 beat @entity83 next week , they will set up their first @entity89 fixture since the @entity9 in may 2012 that will set up a first @entity89 final of the season , against either @entity93 or @entity94 , and @entity0 believes one final spur them on			1
