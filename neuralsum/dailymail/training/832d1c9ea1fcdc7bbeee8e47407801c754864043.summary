by @entity0 a devastated couple cancelled their order for a pram and a cot when they were told their unborn baby had a one per cent chance of survival – but were elated when she was born full of life			1
@entity12 , 32 , and her partner @entity13 , 42 , had been told a rare terminal condition meant their daughter , @entity15 , would either be stillborn or die shortly after birth			1
but to everyone ’s complete shock , the baby was born full of life			1
@entity12 and her partner @entity13 were told baby @entity15 had just a one per cent chance of survival in fact , @entity15 proved so well that she was discharged for her overjoyed parents to take home just five days later			1
ms @entity12 , from @entity27 , in @entity28 , said : ‘ it feels like a miracle after being told they were 99 per cent sure she would die			1
in the end we had to try and accept it and prepare for the worst			0
‘ we had even started to arrange her funeral			0
i have to keep pinching myself			0
i ca n’t believe how lucky we have been to have her home			0
‘ we had no cot and pram because everything had gone back			0
when doctors tell you there is just a one per cent chance your baby will live you need to be prepared for the worst			1
’ now the couple , who both work as teaching assistants , are waiting for the original terminal diagnosis to be ruled out as they suspect @entity15 ’s condition is in fact a much less serious joint disorder affecting just her legs			1
but ms @entity12 has praised medics for the care she received and says she is just delighted and relieved to have her daughter alive			1
before she was born , it was believed that @entity15 had a rare and terminal genetic condition doctors were amazed when @entity15 was delivered full of life and they now believe she actually has a much less serious condition which just affects her legs the drama started at the 20 - week scan when the parents - to - be were told there were abnormalities with their baby daughter ’s legs			1
ms @entity12 said : ‘ @entity72 revealed she had club feet and her knees and hips were fixed in a contracted position , a bit like a kneeling @entity79			1
nobody could tell us why			0
’ the couple were given the option to terminate their pregnancy then , but refused to make any decisions until they knew what was causing the abnormalities			2
@entity88 akinesia deformation sequence is a condition which causes reduced foetal movement and growth			2
it also causes the joints to seize , facial abnormalities , underdevelopment of the lungs and other developmental abnormalities			0
about 30 per cent of babies with the condition are stillborn while most of the rest only survive for a short time after birth			1
they die because of complications caused by the underdevelopment of their lungs			0
it can be inherited but in some cases it is caused by a random gene mutation			0
source : @entity110 ms @entity12 explains : ‘ there was no way we were going to abort our baby just because she had club feet or problems with her legs			1
‘ disabilities are not a barrier to a happy life			2
but the doctors were concerned that the disabilities may have been caused by a genetic condition with much more serious implications			1
’ eventually tests pointed to a rare nerve condition called foetal akinesia deformation sequence			1
it ’s fatal and begins by fusing limbs , before shutting down vital organs causing death in unborn babies			2
if the babies do survive birth , they only live a short time after			2
ms @entity12 says : ‘ we were devastated			1
no test could tell us for certain that is what @entity15 had			2
‘ we would just have to wait and see how it progressed for the rest of the pregnancy			2
i was advised to look out for reduced movement , a sign other limbs were fusing			0
’ the couple remained positive , but when at 32 - weeks their baby ’s movements slowed dramatically , ms @entity12 returned to the hospital for more scans fearing the worst			1
tragically , they revealed that the baby ’s arms were now still , leading medics to conclude she did have the condition and it was spreading			2
ms @entity12 said : ‘ we were taken into a side room after the scan and told our baby had a less than one per cent chance of survival			1
the couple were told that there was a problem after prenatal scans revealed abnormalities in @entity15 's legs mr @entity13 and ms @entity12 decided not to terminate the pregnancy so as to give @entity15 a chance but they cancelled orders for a pram and a cot and started to plan her funeral ‘ we cried and cried because we had n’t given up on her but now it felt like all hope had gone			1
i desperately wanted to believe they were wrong but you can not ignore what the professionals are telling you			0
‘ the only comfort we had was that we had given her every chance by not terminating the pregnancy at 20 - weeks			2
’ the couple , who already have three children between them by past relationships , faced the heart - breaking task of telling ms @entity12 ’s daughters , aged five and seven , and mr @entity13 ’s daughter , aged eight			1
ms @entity12 says : ‘ the girls were so excited about having a baby sister			1
but after being told she had a one per cent chance of life we had to try and prepare them in some way for the fact @entity15 was n’t coming home			1
‘ we called them together and gently told them that their sister would be going straight to heaven to watch over us all			0
‘ the girls were confused and upset but very accepting in that way that children can be			0
’ @entity15 was eventually delivered by c - section and doctors were stunned when she started crying			1
she was taken to the special care baby unit for monitoring as doctors started to reconsider her diagnosis amazingly , the couple ( pictured before the birth ) were able to take @entity15 home just five days after her birth heartbreakingly , they then had to prepare for a birth and a funeral			1
ms @entity12 said : ‘ i just could n’t face it so @entity13 spoke to the undertakers about our situation so they were ready to organise everything when the time came			1
’ the couple also cancelled their delivery of a new pram and cot and packed away the new nursery			0
ms @entity12 said : ‘ it was too painful to see everything in there knowing it would never be used			2
’ at 39 - weeks ms @entity12 was admitted for an induction at the @entity240			1
the parents agreed that their baby should be offered comfort care only to ease any suffering in her final moments			0
ms @entity12 said : ' it feels like a miracle after being told they were 99 per cent sure she would die ' @entity15 is now 11 weeks old and she is thriving despite her initial terrible prognosis ms @entity12 said : ‘ it was heart - breaking to be discussing things like that while i was in labour			1
all i hoped was that she might live long enough for us to meet her and have a cuddle			0
’ it was for this reason that ms @entity12 opted to have her labour monitored , meaning if the baby showed signs of distress action would be taken to assist her delivery			1
she said : ‘ because nobody expected her to live they said they were happy for me not to be monitored			0
but i felt i needed to know if my baby was coming into the world alive or dead even if she was n’t going to live long			0
‘ we had got through the whole pregnancy , i did n’t want her to die during birth if there was a chance i got to hold her , if only for a few minutes			0
’ finally , after an 18 hour labour and with the baby in distress , she was rushed into theatre for an emergency c - section			1
ms @entity12 said : ‘ i thought it was the end			2
but when they lifted her out she was crying and moving her arms and basically doing all the things we had been warned she would n’t do			0
’ ms @entity12 said : ' we are in no way at all angry about what has happened , just so pleased that they were wrong or @entity15 would n't be here today ' they were supposed to hand her to me to pass away in my arms but her cries seemed to be getting stronger			1
‘ i was exhausted but kept thinking : “ they ’ve got it wrong			0
she ’s not dying or they would have given her to me by now ”			0
’ eventually she was briefly shown to her shocked parents and rushed to special baby care for assessment			0
ms @entity12 recalls : ‘ her eyes were wide open looking around			2
it was n’t what i expected at all			0
’ finally the couple went to see their daughter who was breathing unaided but being monitored closely			0
ms @entity12 said : ‘ we were astonished to be told things were looking good and they were very optimistic			1
apart from the issue with her legs there appeared to be nothing wrong with her			0
’ just five days later they took her home			0
ms @entity12 laughs : ‘ we had nothing ready for her but none of that mattered			2
we just could n’t believe we had our baby home			0
the couple say their other daughters are delighted with their little sister ‘ our daughters were over the moon and kept asking if @entity15 had changed her mind about living in heaven			2
i told them “ yes she has ”			0
’ @entity15 is now 11 weeks old and is thriving			2
consultants are yet to make an alternative diagnosis but have told her parents that they are confident she no longer fits the criteria for foetal akinesia deformation sequence			0
ms @entity12 said : ‘ we are in no way at all angry about what has happened , just so pleased that they were wrong or @entity15 would n’t be here today			1
‘ it is such a rare condition and so very hard to diagnose that we know the medics were only doing their very best by telling us what all the signs pointed to			2
‘ thankfully , it does n’t appear now to be the case and we could n’t be more delighted about that			0
‘ the care we have received has been absolutely amazing			0

@entity12 and @entity13 were told their baby would not survive
pregnancy scans suggested she had a rare and terminal condition
they prepared themselves for her death after she was born by c - section
they were overjoyed when baby @entity15 was delivered full of life
she was soon discharged from hospital and now doctors believe she actually has a much less serious condition only affecting her legs
