houses in @entity2 's top 10 most expensive boroughs are worth as much as the entire property markets in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 combined , research has revealed			2
the total value of the @entity10 's housing stock has risen slightly to £ 5trillion over the past year , but housing wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated in @entity2 and the @entity12 , according to international real estate adviser @entity13			1
in their annual @entity16 analysis , @entity13 found the capital 's homes are now worth an aggregate £ 1.12trillion , accounting for 22.5 per cent of the @entity10 's housing value			1
this graphic shows how house prices have fallen across the @entity10 since 2007 except in @entity2 , where the total property stock has increased in value by 14.2 per cent			1
@entity6 has seen a drop of 3.9 per cent , @entity5 14 per cent and @entity7 50.9 per cent - and the housing markets in all three countries are now worth the same as the capital alone the @entity28 is one of @entity2 's top 10 most expensive boroughs which the combined property wealth of is now more than the entire stock of @entity6 , @entity5 and @entity7			1
pictured here is @entity34 it shows how , while @entity2 's house prices have traditionally been higher , the financial crisis has triggered a polarisation of the market as property values fall in every other region of the @entity10			2
ten years ago the @entity10 's housing stock was worth just £ 2.9trillion , rising to £ 5.4trillion at the peak of the market in 2007			1
however , the @entity10 total value remains -6.4 per cent below its peak while @entity2 's residential real estate has risen 14.2 per cent more than in 2007			2
the value gained - £ 140million - exceeds the total value of all homes across the whole of the @entity53 of @entity54 where the total housing stock is worth just £ 128billion , researchers said			1
in the last year alone , it has risen by 6.8 per cent are now worth an aggregate £ 1.12trillion			2
at the other extreme , @entity7 's stock is worth £ 72billion , having fallen -10.2 per cent in the past year			0
properties for sale in @entity61 which has a lower total value than the commuter hotspot of @entity64 in @entity65 , researchers found estate agent @entity13 says the capital accounts for some 37 per cent of the @entity10 's total private rented stock value , putting it 36 per cent above the 2007 level savills say it reflects the fact that equity rich markets have outperformed the average and property wealth continues to be more and more polarised between @entity76 , and between different tenures			1
@entity7 has been the worst affected part of the @entity10 since the crisis with the value of stock falling 50 per cent to £ 72billion			0
the ten @entity2 boroughs highlighted in the report are @entity84 , @entity85 & @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 & @entity94 and @entity95			1
together , they have an aggregate value equivalent to the total value of @entity6 , @entity5 and @entity7 combined at just over £ 550billion			0
even within @entity2 , wealth is increasingly focused in core central and high value boroughs			2
@entity7 has been the worst affected part of the @entity10 since the crisis with the value of stock falling 50 per cent			0
pictured here is terraced house in @entity105 , @entity106 the richest borough – the @entity84 – has just 121,600 units , with a total value of £ 95billion , more than twice the value of @entity111 and almost three times that of @entity113			1
and beyond the capital the analysis highlights some pockets of very concentrated housing wealth			1
for example , the high value commuter hotspot of @entity64 in @entity65 , which includes @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , has a housing stock value of £ 31billion , more than that of @entity61 ( £ 29billion ) , while that of @entity124 and @entity125 ( £ 23billion ) is slightly more than that of @entity127			1
@entity2 's dominance is even more pronounced in the private rented sector than in the owner occupied sector			0
the capital accounts for some 37 per cent of the @entity10 's total private rented stock value , putting it 36 per cent above the 2007 level			0
at the owner occupier level , some £ 1.7trillion of housing is now in the hands of owners with no mortgage debt			0
this is an increase of 76 per cent in the past 10 years , and 1.4 per cent in 2012			0
by contrast , mortgaged properties have a total value of £ 1.8trillion , just 42 per cent higher than in 2002 and down -0.6 per cent on last year			0
this means that mortgaged owner occupied stock accounts for 37 per cent of the total value of @entity10 housing compared to 44 per cent 10 years ago			2
@entity150 , director of @entity13 residential research , said : ' these distinctions between @entity76 , and in particular between @entity2 and the @entity12 and the rest , and the concentration of housing wealth in ever fewer hands , will have long term implications			1
' it will affect people 's ability to get on the housing ladder , trade up or relocate			0
in turn , it has implications for social and labour mobility and , ultimately , the economy			0
' our analysis also highlights growing value in the private rented sector , not least because demand continues to outpace supply			0
' this will create investment opportunities for those with equity , and opportunities for institutional investors to meet the needs of those excluded from home ownership			0

city of @entity84 has total value more than twice that of @entity111
