for all the fuss of @entity3 players entering a casino , a point seemed to get missed			1
the odds are that it was the croupiers who ended the night exhausted and nursing an addiction			0
has there ever been such a compelling group of players as those who have played for @entity3 over the past 10 years , @entity13 teams that have been so easy to look at but also so magnificently efficient in pursuit of trophies ? they tick the boxes , one by one			1
they play beautiful football , they win and their best players have been homegrown			0
when they lose , it ’s a head - spinning crisis of hysteria			2
but they do n’t lose much and that is why they are special			0
@entity31 ( left ) and @entity32 were spotted at a @entity3 casino in the early hours of monday morning both were in action as @entity3 trained on monday ahead of their @entity37 tie at @entity38 the @entity13 club will be aiming to put behind them their weekend defeat to @entity42 with a good result at @entity38 @entity32 looks on crestfallen following @entity42 's goal at the @entity45 on saturday afternoon it will be 10 years this spring since they ended their five - season @entity49 drought			1
in that time they have won the title six times , the @entity53 twice and the @entity37 three times			1
it ’s not a perfect club ; they are not the wholesome organisation they were once conveyed as – witness the @entity58 tax scandal and their ban from signing players in 2015 – but they are not quite the @entity63 - protected conspirators of @entity65 ’s imagination either			2
whatever the true morality of the club ’s business , they have repeatedly produced brilliant football teams that are better to watch than any other			2
and now they arrive in @entity72 needing to clear a hurdle			0
it is lost on no - one that three entire seasons have passed since their symbolic day at @entity76 in 2011			1
it is the longest stretch the club have gone without winning the @entity37 since @entity79 bought back into this tiki - taka business a decade or so ago			1
the signs are that the era might be drawing to a close			0
that 2011 class of @entity32 , @entity85 and @entity86 was as good as it gets			0
after @entity88 were demolished in the @entity76 final , sir @entity87 said : ‘ no one has ever given us a hiding like that			0
’ it 's been three seasons since @entity3 were last crowned as kings of @entity97 - in 2011 at @entity76 midfielder @entity86 ( left ) was outstanding as @entity3 swept aside @entity88 3 - 1 in that final @entity76 was where the dream team of 1992 had won their first @entity37			1
ahead of that final @entity100 spent the night arguing with @entity101 about how many steps they would have to climb to get the trophy			2
the stadium , in essence , is central to their history			0
and the 2011 final , with seven youth - teamers in the 11 , was the ideal , perfectly - executed conclusion to a narrative			2
but was it the conclusion to this era ? as it happens , @entity32 , in his battle for the ages with @entity118 , followed that @entity37 win with his two most prolific seasons			1
mind - boggling scoring figures			2
but three seasons have yielded only one @entity49 title and one @entity53			1
not shabby , but not ideal			0
@entity85 is 35 and an unused substitute in five of the past seven @entity3 games			1
the test , should they get past @entity38 , is for @entity129 to prove he can build another great side			1
it will inevitably be led by @entity32 – @entity129 will know there is little merit or job security in upsetting him ( not to mention the fact he is going nowhere by virtue of @entity137 ) – and @entity58 is of gold standard			0
@entity139 has more to prove			0
@entity3 manager @entity129 ( centre ) is hoping his reign can emulate the club 's recent success @entity32 ( centre ) will undoubtedly be the catalyst if @entity3 are to dominate @entity97 once more @entity58 will also prove pivotal to future @entity3 success - especially short - term following their transfer ban @entity139 ( centre ) will be hoping to score on his first return to @entity150 since leaving @entity151 last summer there is scope to develop another great side			1
but just as @entity157 ’s time was up at the @entity158 , it is natural to wonder if @entity3 ’s slip from extraordinary to very good is a long - term deal			1
it is natural to wonder what they can do without the ability to sign players this year			0
the nervousness around the club is tangible			0
the club won 11 games in a row and defeat against @entity42 has coaxed out a few neuroses from fans			1
the confidence , at times , feels as sturdy as a house of cards			2
against that backdrop , who would bet against the best club of recent history now showing @entity38 that class is permanent ? @entity182 2 @entity3 6 , may 2009 one of the most astonishing @entity184 matches of recent times			1
@entity85 assisted four and @entity32 scored two ( he could have had five more )			0
@entity86 described it as ‘ the best @entity184 of all time ’ and @entity32 was heralded as ‘ @entity188 , @entity189 and best all rolled into one ’			0
@entity3 5 @entity182 0 , november 2010 the 6 - 2 win was remarkable but folk of @entity3 consider this an even greater victory			1
and @entity32 did n’t even score , though it was rated one of his most complete performances			0
@entity85 said : ‘ when we got into the dressing room after the game we gave ourselves a standing ovation			0
’ @entity3 3 @entity88 1 , @entity37 final , may 2011 arguably the finest moment of @entity3 ’s best crop of players			1
@entity87 admitted that ‘ no - one has ever given us a hiding like that ’			2
@entity32 scored @entity3 ’ s second and was named man of the match			1
@entity211 goal versus @entity212 in 2005 it was a strike in a 4 - 2 defeat in the @entity37 , but the brilliance of the moment should not be understated			1
with a single the flick of his boot from the edge of the area , @entity211 wrong - footed three @entity212 defenders and @entity222			2
they lost but it was a truly wonderful piece of skill			0
@entity3 v @entity225 , may 2005 it was not a big game			2
but it was a huge moment – @entity32 scored his first goal for the club			0
he came on as a substitute and scored a lob within 17 seconds			0
it was disallowed for offside so he did it again before celebrating in @entity211 ’s arms			0
it made the 17 - year - old the youngest scorer in @entity3 ’s history and he has since gone on to break more than a few other records .			1

@entity38 host @entity3 in *tuesday* 's @entity37 last - *16* tie
in 10 years @entity3 have won six @entity49 titles and two @entity53 *del* @entity246
they have also lifted the @entity37 trophy three times
@entity3 lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity42 in @entity49 on saturday afternoon
@entity38 vs @entity3 : how do the two teams compare ?
