@entity0 are willing to listen to offers for club record signing @entity2 , who @entity4 says ' has a cloud hanging over him at the moment '			1
@entity2 missed a glorious chance against @entity9 to justify some of his £ 10million fee and has looked bereft of confidence since joining from @entity12			1
@entity4 is determined to bring in a striker to share the goal burden on @entity15 this transfer window , and @entity2 could leave to raise funds			1
@entity2 ( front ) , pictured in action against @entity9 , could be sold by @entity0 this month the striker has scored just two goals since arriving from @entity12 for a club record £ 10million ' i ca n't say he 's staying , ' said @entity4			1
' if someone comes in and offers an enormous amount of money the club looks at it			1
that 's the same with every player			0
every club i 've been at has worked that way			2
' if something comes on the table you sit down and look at it , take a view of whether it 's right for the club or not			2
that will be the same with @entity2			1
' @entity41 has scored just twice since his move last summer , a tap - in from two yards in the @entity45 and a ball deflecting off the back of his head late on against @entity50			1
the @entity0 head coach added : ' he needs a goal			2
he ca n't buy a goal at the moment			0
but you have a look at what he did ( against @entity9 ) , the effort and commitment he put in , the way he worked for the team			0
@entity0 boss @entity4 has admitted that the club will listen to offers for @entity41 in january @entity41 reacts after missing an excellent chance to score against @entity9 at the @entity66 last weekend ' he worked very hard and linked play well at times			1
he 's just a little bit disappointed he has n't scored			2
if he 'd have taken that chance you would have seen a different player			0
' he 's got a cloud hanging over him at the moment			0
if we can lift that cloud and release him a little bit			0
@entity77 football , especially the @entity78 , is different to football on the continent			0
' it takes a while to get used to			0
