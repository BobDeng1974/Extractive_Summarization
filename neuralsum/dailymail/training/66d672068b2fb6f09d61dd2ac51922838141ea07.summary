by @entity0 after watching a film in which a man travelled around the world on his motorbike , @entity2 journalist @entity1 was inspired to go on an odyssey of her own			1
the international aspect did n't really appeal to her , though , and she thought she 'd like some company			0
so it was , then , that on may 27 last year , miss @entity1 set off on her own challenge : a six - month , 1,000 - mile trek around @entity2 , with @entity15 , her newly - acquired donkey			1
@entity1 , 34 , and her donkey , @entity15 , spent nearly six months trekking 1,000 miles around @entity2 @entity15 , who never made it as a beach donkey because he does n't like sand , walked more than 1,000 miles miss @entity1 was joined occasionally by relatives or her boyfriend , but mostly it was just her and @entity15 miss @entity1 said : ' i was inspired by the film @entity24 , and remember seeing horses in it , but i thought a horse would have been a bit too big and scary			1
' when the @entity30 opened , i thought the idea of walking right the way around the country was amazing			0
' she bought @entity15 , a five - year - old gelding , from a @entity37 dealer who was selling him because he was meant to be a beach donkey but did n't like putting his hooves on sand			2
the pair of them set off from miss @entity1 's home in @entity45 early last summer , heading north up the coast and then clockwise the whole way around @entity2			1
with little more than 29 maps , a video camera , and a couple of panniers with such essentials as hoofpicks and fly repellent , the pair made the countryside their home , camping in fields overnight , and clip - clopping through the countryside by day			2
miss @entity1 said : ' thankfully i met a lot of kind people along the way and many of them let me stay in their living rooms or camp in their back gardens			1
@entity15 and miss @entity1 walked clockwise around @entity2 after starting in @entity45 last may @entity67 : the pair started in @entity45 in may last year and walked clockwise around @entity2 room at the inn ? miss @entity1 camped in fields or , if she was lucky , stayed in kind strangers ' spare rooms ' my mum and dad came along with me for a few days , as did my partner and sister , but for a lot of the time it was just me and @entity15			1
' people living along the route who read about her trip on social media sites would get in touch and offer miss @entity1 a bed for the night , something she particularly appreciated when the weather got colder			2
' even when i had n't met people i would still manage to stay in camp sites or farmers ' fields with their permission , ' she said			0
' i was overwhelmed by the support i received			0
' while the scenery and the kindness of strangers were the high points , the low point was when @entity15 decided to demonstrate just how stubborn a donkey can be			2
miss @entity1 said : ' just as we reached @entity103 on @entity104 , @entity15 decided he did n't want to walk up hills			1
' that area is full of hills , so it was a complete nightmare			0
we 'd only walked about a mile from where we woke up , and i spent five hours tugging him to come with me , but he would n't budge			0
' in the end , i decided to take him off the leading rein and i just walked on , hoping he would follow me of his own accord			2
' thankfully , he did , but not before i 'd had time to wonder why on earth i was doing this in the first place			0
' the trip , which she initially thought might take two or three months ended up taking nearly six , and miss @entity1 and @entity15 trotted back into @entity45 just before @entity119			1
mane attraction : trekking with a donkey drew lots of attention , including from these two punks better turn back : the route was n't always suited to @entity15 , forcing last - minute changes of plan little donkey : @entity15 enjoyed the attentions of some young schoolchildren during his @entity2 odyssey @entity15 is now resting in a field near miss @entity1 's home in @entity45 after his six - month trek stunning scenery : the journalist and the donkey spent all day in the fresh air , admiring the @entity2 countryside she said : ' by the end of it i was absolutely shattered			1
my shoe laces were rotten , so i had to buy some more , and a few other bits and bobs along the way , but it was totally worth it			0
' i 'm just glad i 've shown people that it is possible to go out and have an adventure on your own doorstep without spending a fortune			0
' @entity15 is now putting his hooves up in a field near miss @entity1 's house , and she has bought him a friend , another donkey called @entity161 , to keep him company through the winter			1
miss @entity1 raised £ 600 for local charities during her travels , and is now hoping to turn the 3,000 photos and 200 hours of video footage she shot along the way into a book and film			1
she needs to raise £ 28,000 by the end of the month to do this and already has £ 17,000 pledged to help her			0
she said : ' i got 200 hours of video footage along the way so my partner @entity174 , who is a film - maker , and i are hoping to put it all together			0
' i 'm also writing a book about the journey			0
