a 22 - month - old girl who was left with three legs after she was separated from her conjoined twin in @entity3 has arrived in @entity4 to undergo life - changing surgery			1
@entity6 was joined at the pelvis with her sister when they were born in a rural village in @entity3 , and the two girls were separated when they were 20 years old , but her sister did not survive			1
after the surgery , @entity6 was left three legs , three kidneys and possible reproductive issues			1
at the weekend , she arrived in @entity4 , where she will multiple procedures at @entity18 to remove two of her legs - procedures that she would not be able to have in @entity3			1
only her left leg has function and the other two will be removed the hospital 's chief of staff , dr. @entity32 , said her middle leg would be removed and that her right leg did not have a functional knee or foot so would likely be removed from above the knee , @entity31 reported			2
she will then be fitted with a prosthetic and will hopefully be able to walk			0
' i think she ’ll be very functional as a walker , at the very least with crutches or with the arm crutches or something similar , ' dr. @entity40 said at a press conference			2
dr @entity32 added : ' will she be able to run and play like other children ? no. she will be different than other children , but she will be able to move about and keep up with her peers			0
' life - changing : she arrived in @entity4 with her mother , who says she hopes her daughter will be able to walk hopeful : dr @entity32 , the chief of staff at the @entity4 hospital , said her medical condition was so rare that there are only 12 survivable cases like it in the world each year - but that he knew his team could help twins who are joined at the pelvis , like @entity6 was , can be fused at a 180 degree angle from each other in a condition known as ' @entity68 '			1
the twins can share two legs , three legs - with the third often being two fused legs - or four legs			1
@entity6 has been left with three legs , although one does not have any function and one has no function in the foot or knee			1
as well as sharing the pelvic region , they can share the gastrointestinal tract and genital area			0
most twins will need these regions reconstructed after they are separated			2
both twins do often not make it through surgery			0
about one in every 100,000 live births and one in 10 conjoined twin births are affected by the condition			2
the toddler ’s trip to @entity4 was made possible by @entity95 and the @entity96 , which secured funding for her medical costs and long - term rehabilitative care			1
' my hope is that she will be fine and she will do well with her health … and she will also be able to walk , ' @entity6 's mother , @entity102 , said through a translator at the press conference			2
@entity6 will have her first surgery in a month , after doctors make a thorough plan of how to move forward			1
' i think we can execute this very well , ' dr @entity32 said			0
' it 's the thinking process behind the plan that ’s going to take some time			0
' her medical condition was so rare that there are only 12 survivable cases like it in the world each year , he added			0
@entity96 aims to provide access to donated transformative surgical care for children who are living with a deformity or injuries that can not be treated in their home country			0
the @entity129 and the @entity130 provides care for the children once donations are secured			0
helping out : @entity129 ' @entity18 , pictured , carries out surgical procedures for children in need after funds are raised by the @entity96 see below for video			0

@entity6 was born joined at the pelvis with her twin sister and they were separated at 20 weeks - although her sister did not survive
she was left with three legs - only one of which is functional
doctors in @entity4 will now remove two of the legs and carry out other reconstructive procedures that she would not be able to have in @entity3
