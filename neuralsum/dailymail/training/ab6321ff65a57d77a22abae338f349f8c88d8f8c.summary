the 26 - year - old saw his 155 - yard approach to the ninth - the last of his second round - veer wildly off to the right , narrowly clearing the water guarding the adjacent 18th green and coming up just short of the putting surface			2
from there the 2012 champion saved par to keep a bogey off his card as he finished with a 68 - matched by playing partner and co-leader @entity22 - to post 12 under for 36 holes			2
flying high : @entity1 has maintained his share of the lead at the @entity9 in @entity10 they were later joined by another @entity27 @entity26 and @entity29 @entity28			1

@entity26 , winner in 2011 , shot a best of the day 63 which was matched by @entity55 golfer @entity54 who narrowly missed a birdie putt at the last to close on nine under			1
