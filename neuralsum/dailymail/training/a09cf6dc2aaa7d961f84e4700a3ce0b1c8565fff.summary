two schoolboy brothers have been scarred for life after temporary tattoos burnt into their skin on an @entity4 from hell			1
@entity6 , 16 , and @entity7 , 14 , pestered their mother to allow them to have henna body art while on an all - inclusive holiday in @entity12			1
but instead of natural henna the tattoo artist , who worked in the resort where they were staying , used super-strength black henna			1
warning graphic content @entity19 , 16 , got a tattoo using ' black henna ' while on holiday in @entity12 but was left permanently scarred after chemical in the dye burned into his skin younger brother @entity7 , 13 , suffered a similar reaction			1
unlike henna , which is a natural plant dye which turns the skin dark brown , ' black henna ' is synthetic and often made with hair dye which burns the skin while henna itself is a harmless natural product used to turn the skin dark brown , ' black ' henna is usually made using hair dye which contains harmful chemicals which burn the skin			1
on the plane home @entity6 and @entity7 could n't stop itching and had to be pulled out of school when they returned to the @entity44 as the patterns turned into sores			1
the dodgy tattoos have permanent scars on their backs and the brothers now ca n't take their tops off in the sun as doctors warned to avoid direct sunlight on the area			1
their furious mother @entity56 , 48 , yesterday warned other parents thinking of letting their kids have holiday tattoos to think twice			1
the tattoos were initially fine but began itching on the way home and eventually turned into large sores mother @entity56 described her anger after the boys got the tattoos from someone working in their holiday resort the full - time mother said : ' the boys had been asking for henna tattoos and i gave in and we had them done by the man running the gift shop in the hotel			1
' we sat in the gift shop whilst he did them			2
now i wish i had never let them have them done			2
' as a parent i was mortified and devastated by what i saw			0
they had pussed and swelled up massively			0
' i wish i had never let the boys have them			0
it was a huge mistake			0
i would ask any other parent to think twice before letting their children have them done			0
' the mother , who has been locked in a three - year legal battle , added : ' i ca n't believe it has dragged on this long			2
the pain and suffering my boys have been through i would n't wish it on my worst enemy			0
' but all that is compounded by @entity99 and their reaction			0
their behaviour has been awful and that have treated us with contempt throughout this process			0
' they are in the wrong but they think they can drag this out and we will just go away			0
but it 's just not right that they can allow this sort of thing to go on in their resorts then cover it up as if nothing ever happened			0
' the family went for a week - long stay at the @entity121 , in @entity12 in april 2011 , when @entity6 was 13 and @entity7 was just 11			1
since going on the holiday in 2011 ( pictured ) @entity56 has been locked in a legal battle with @entity124 @entity7 ( left ) and @entity6 were just 11 and 13 when the tattoos were done while the family were in @entity12 @entity56 , of @entity127 , @entity128 , said : ' i took the boys to our doctor who said they were experiencing a reaction to the chemical @entity135 [ @entity136 ] which is used in black henna			1
' he diagnosed contact dermatitis and they were given a steroid cream and moisturiser to assist with the healing and discomfort			0
' the tattoos looked horrific and had blistered terribly and were causing a lot of distress and sleepless nights			2
' the boys were prescribed steroid cream to bring the swelling down but it did nothing to help but seven months later the tattoos still had not healed and she had to take them to a specialist dermatologist			2
she added : ' despite all the time the scars were still visible and he believed it would take several more months for the reaction to settle completely			0
' it was a horrible experience for us all to go through			0
the boys because of the pain and discomfort and scarring , and as parents , seeing the boys in so much stress and not knowing what had happened to their skin			2
' even now they cant go out in the sun properly as if they get heat on the areas where the tattoos were they come out again faint and it really hurts then both			2
' the boys have now been told they will not be able to have a permanent tattoo , dye their hair or have piercings because of the reactions they suffered			1
the family 's solicitor @entity182 , head of travel law at @entity186 solicitors , said : ' people assume , when they stay at an all - inclusive resort , that the facilities provided will be safe to use			1
' it is disgraceful that @entity191 continue to allow @entity193 tattoo artists to operate within these resorts unchecked knowing that the ink they 're using can lead to horrific scarring and disfigurement			0
' a @entity124 spokesman said : ' @entity124 were concerned to learn of the reaction that these customers experienced following the henna tattoos they had during their holiday to @entity12 in 2011			1
' @entity124 takes the well - being of all of its customers very seriously			2
however , as this matter is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings we 're unable to comment further			0

@entity6 , 16 , and @entity7 , 14 , had tattoos on holiday
designs were initially fine but began to itch then turned into sores
unlike natural henna , so - called ' black henna ' is often made using hair dye
chemical is not safe for use on skin and can cause burning
the pair are now permanently scarred and can not expose skin to sunlight
