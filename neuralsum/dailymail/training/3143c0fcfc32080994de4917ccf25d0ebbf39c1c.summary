by @entity0 published : 04:05 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 14:31 est , 24 september 2013 the @entity3 ’s @entity2 headquarters sits next door to the sports ground of the @entity6 and now they have something else in common — they are both to be run by @entity8			1
for @entity11 at one sometimes strife - ridden @entity10 institution read @entity12 at another , albeit slightly less important one			1
@entity12 , the 56 - year - old chief executive of @entity14 , was yesterday brought in to run the @entity3 , his mission to try to build the sport up to a level befitting the country which hosts its most prestigious tournament			1
new man : @entity12 has been named the new chief executive of the @entity3 men women @entity8 @entity22 ( 11 ) @entity23 ( 46 ) @entity24 ( 40 ) @entity25 @entity26 ( 3 ) @entity27 ( 38 ) @entity28 ( 76 ) taking over from the polarising and well - rewarded figure of @entity31 , no time was wasted in declaring a break from certain aspects associated with the seven - year reign that is about to end			1
firstly , @entity3 chairman @entity35 volunteered that @entity12 would be paid a salary of £ 300,000 , less than half the package that @entity31 took home last year , which included a bonus of £ 200,000 and £ 40,000 in pension payments			1
secondly , @entity12 , who will take charge in january , emphasised that his vision for the @entity3 was a broad church			1
no more would the governing body regard outside constituencies of the sport — be they maverick coaches , parents or private academies — as a potential threat but as partners to help the game grow			2
over and out : @entity31 has been replaced as chief executive of the @entity3 by @entity55 1995 - 1999 - @entity24 , sales and @entity57 at @entity58 jan 2000 – aug 2003 - president of @entity8 's largest brewery , @entity61 may 2004 - president and ceo of @entity14 in 2008 , the @entity65 tournaments set a record for combined sales and rank among the top global events in terms of attendance and profitability			1
' we ca n’t do it all ourselves , ’ was among the many encouraging statements the new man made when unveiled at the end of a prolonged search that saw 350 applications and nearly 30 interviews			2
he will , of course , be judged by actions rather than words , but he has been turned to after a successful nine years in @entity8 which has seen a combination of increased grass - roots participation and improved elite performance			0
although not a high - profile figure in the world game , he has built up a good reputation , albeit in a country where the pressure to deliver is not the same			0
it could hardly be otherwise with @entity94 just down the road and more than £ 30million being pumped into the game from that event ’s profits alone			2
mixed : @entity28 ( left ) and @entity27 are on the up but @entity26 is the only leading @entity10 man while some will regret the fact the successful candidate is not @entity10 , @entity12 ’s lack of baggage and outsider status may make it easier to make the tough decisions needed to change the culture of the organisation			2
the downside is that it will take time for him to understand some of the sport ’s nuances here			0
@entity12 pledged to change the image of the @entity3			1
' i would n’t have joined this organisation if i thought it was useless , ’ he said			0
he pledged to learn fast and travel outside the @entity117 , similar to what he has done in @entity8 , where strong relationships in the outlying provinces of that vast country have been developed			0
he was most definitely right in describing the job as a ‘ fantastic opportunity ’ because the potential is there			0
@entity26 — recuperating from what is initially said to have been a successful back operation — has put a spring in the step of @entity10 tennis since his triumph at @entity94			0
@entity26 ’s greatest contribution to tennis in @entity25 is winning , ' said @entity12			2
the manner of these things is that there is always a honeymoon period that follows such appointments			0
there is much hard work and many hard decisions ahead to improve access to the sport in a country where , he will find , football is his new ice hockey			0

@entity12 replaces @entity31 as the @entity3 's chief executive
@entity12 was *previously* president and ceo of @entity14
he will begin his role on january 6
@entity12 will be paid £ 300,000 , less than @entity31 's £ *400,000*
