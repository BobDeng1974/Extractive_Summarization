in the man - made world there is nothing like the vast , wizened majesty of an ancient tree			0
they are living links to the distant past whose very existence mocks the transience of our own mortality			0
@entity15 photographer @entity14 has spent the past 14 years travelling the world in a quest to document the world 's biggest , rarest and oldest trees			1
most have only survived thanks to their isolation on remote mountainsides , private estates , or nature preserves , but just a few maintain a proud , though often precarious , existence in the midst of civilization			2
' standing as the earth â€™s largest and oldest living monuments , i believe these symbolic trees will take on a greater significance , especially at a time when our focus is directed at finding better ways to live with the environment , celebrating the wonders of nature that have survived throughout the centuries , ' she writes on her website			2
' by feeling a larger sense of time , developing a relationship with the natural world , we carry that awareness with us as it becomes a part of who we are			0
