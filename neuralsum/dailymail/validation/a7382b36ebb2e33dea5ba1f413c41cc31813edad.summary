guilty - stricken : @entity0 , pictured above as police found him , has spoken about his involvement in the 1990 heist from a @entity5 art gallery the security guard who was duped into letting the thieves at the center of @entity10 's most notorious unsolved art crime into the @entity5 gallery from which they looted paintings worth $ 500million has spoken of his guilt			1
@entity0 , who was a college drop - out working night shifts at the @entity16 in 1990 , said he still feels ' horrible ' about his inadvertent role in the crime , which has baffled investigators for decades			1
@entity0 was duped by two thieves in police uniform , who persuaded him to let them into the gallery , then overwhelmed him and left him in the basement covered in duct tape			1
he spent the next seven hours handcuffed to an electrical box alongside another guard , while the two men cut loose enormously valuable @entity28 from their frames , including works by @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
the @entity35 has never come close to finding the paintings - despite supposedly promising leads last may - and there remains a $ 5million reward for information leading to their return			1
@entity0 reflected on the night of march 18 , 1990 , in an interview published by @entity44			1
he said : ' they had hats , badges , they looked like cops , and i let them in ... ' ' ultimately i 'm the one who made the decision to buzz them in			0
' it 's the kind of thing most people do n't have to learn to cope with			0
it 's like doing penance			0
he added : ' i do n't want to be remembered for this alone			0
i 'd like to be remembered for the good things i 've done			0
i 'm a husband , a father of two really cool kids			0
' in total the haul including three @entity31 works , five sketches by @entity33 , a @entity34 painting and a painting by @entity32 - one of only 36 in the world			1
a bronze eagle statue , a @entity101 beaker from 1100 @entity102 and a painting by @entity104 were also taken			0
aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the men may have been			2
missing : the @entity16 continues to display empty frames in the spots where the paintings should be a petty @entity5 criminal , who had broken into the gallery before denies having anything to do with the heist , has since said he believes his boasts to criminal associates may have sparked the crime			1
@entity123 , who was a teenager in the 1980s and made it inside the gallery , told veteran crime reporter @entity125 that he believes information he gave ' criminal associates ' about the lax security may have focused the thieves ' attention on the @entity16			2
according to @entity125 , whose recently - published book about the heist was previewed in the @entity138 , the information passed up the chain in the criminal underworld until a @entity5 gangster decided to make the attempt			1
the @entity35 has periodically renewed its appeal for information about the artworks , and carries information about the reward prominently on its website			2
reward : the @entity35 has claimed to be hot on the trail of the paintings in the past - but little has emerged			1
pictured above is a 2013 press conference at which a $ 5million reward was announced in 2013 , the bureau claimed to have made ' significant investigative progress ' after figuring out that the stolen paintings had been taken to @entity154 and @entity155			1
agents also said ' a criminal organization with a base in the @entity159 ' was responsible , and had attempted to sell the paintings in 2003			0
federal prosecutors have said they would even consider immunity for those who help recover the artworks , and said they could pay the huge reward anonymously			0
in may 2014 , the bureau made another announcement , saying there had been ' confirmed sightings ' of the work - and even naming three men in connection with the crime			0
however , two of them , @entity172 , @entity174 , are dead , and the third , @entity175 , denies any involvement			0
@entity175 has denied any knowledge of the missing work			0
in a long piece in the @entity180 , @entity175 , a long - time criminal in his 70s who recently got out of prison , revealed that @entity35 agents had raided his shed hoping to find the paintings			2
there was nothing there , and @entity175 continues to deny he ever had anything to do with the theft			0
the museum , meanwhile , has been displaying empty frames in place of the missing masterworks ever since the theft			2
it is now offering virtual tours and lectures about the work , in an effort to make up for their continued absence - though the museum 's directors continue to hold out hope they will one day return			2
