@entity8 , a seven - year - old crossbreed dog from @entity10 , had to be rushed to the operating table and saved by a team of vets who performed life - saving surgery on him			1
the 45 - year - old said : ‘ i had n't even noticed that the lights had been chewed at this stage but it quickly became clear what had happened			2
‘ back in march he ate one of my scarves and needed an operation to remove it , but i thought it was just a one - off incident as he had n't shown any signs that he was going to be a repeat offender			2
i 've had dogs all my life and have never known a dog act like this before			2
’ an x-ray shed light on @entity8 's problem - the tangled remains of the decorations showed up in his stomach and would have proved fatal if they were not removed			1
