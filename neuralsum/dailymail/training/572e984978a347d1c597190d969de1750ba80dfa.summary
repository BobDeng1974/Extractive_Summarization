by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 20:27 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 15:48 est , 11 december 2012 in the next salvo of an escalating war between two giants of social media , @entity3 has announced new versions of its @entity9 and @entity11 apps to mimic @entity13 - style filters and editing software just one day after the @entity16 - owned picture app completely blocked user 's ability to embed its photos in tweets			1
the new @entity3 app will allow users to take a pic , crop it , enhance it , run it through one of eight filters , and then share it , all without closing the app. the filters were made by @entity28 , a company that specializes in photo editing software for mobile apps			2
photo filters have become wildly popular but it 's still uncertain how many users will adopt the new @entity3 app as @entity13 has developed its own unique identity			1
the new update to the @entity3 app includes a photosharing service to make up for @entity13 's cut off			2
here 's what you get			0
users will be able to take photos , alter them , and share them to @entity3 all without closing the app. 2			0
the software will also include editing tools like zoom and crop			0
closest to @entity13 , you 'll be able to run your pics through one of eight filters with names like @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , happy and @entity68 @entity69 , the ceo of the photo - sharing service that was snapped up by @entity16 earlier this year , announced last week that @entity13 has turned off support for ' @entity3 cards , ' signaling a deepening rift between two of the web 's biggest brands			1
@entity3 users started to complain earlier this week in public messages that @entity13 photos were not displaying properly on @entity3 's website			1
clarifying the situation , @entity81 later released a statement saying : ' we believe the best experience is for us to link back to where the content lives			0
' @entity13 started off as a smartphone application - only service but has recently improved its website			0
' a handful of months ago , we supported @entity3 cards because we had a minimal web presence , ' mr @entity69 said , noting that the company has since released new features that allow users to comment about and ' like ' photos directly on @entity13 's website			1
the rivalry between @entity16 and @entity3 intensified in april when the former outbid @entity3 to nab fast - growing @entity13 in a cash - and - stock deal valued at the time at $ 1 billion			1
the acquisition closed in september for roughly $ 715 million , due to @entity16 's recent stock drop			0
the companies ' ties have been strained since			0
in july , @entity3 blocked @entity13 from using its data to help new @entity13 users find friends			0

@entity13 , which has 100 million users , allows consumers to tweak the photos they take on their smartphones and share the images with their friends , a feature that @entity3 has reportedly also begun to develop			2
@entity3 's executive chairman @entity128 was an investor in @entity13 and hoped to acquire it before @entity16 ceo @entity130 tabled a successful bid			2
when mr @entity130 announced the acquisition in an april blog post , he said one of @entity13 's strengths was its inter-connectivity with other social networks and pledged to continue running it as an independent service			2
pledge : @entity16 ceo @entity130 pledged to keep @entity13 's ties to other social networks including @entity3 , pictured , when he bought it in april ' we think the fact that @entity13 is connected to other services beyond @entity16 is an important part of the experience , ' mr @entity130 wrote			1
' we plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks			0
' a @entity3 spokesman declined to comment at the time of @entity13 's announcement , but a status message on @entity3 's website confirmed that users are ' experiencing issues , ' such as ' cropped images ' when viewing @entity13 photos on @entity3			1
@entity69 noted that @entity13 users will be able to ' continue to be able to share to @entity3 as they originally did before the @entity161 implementation			0
