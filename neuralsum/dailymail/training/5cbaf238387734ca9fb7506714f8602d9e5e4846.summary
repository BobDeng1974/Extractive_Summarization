@entity0 has shown off a bendable battery that can wrap around a person 's wrist			1
the company says it is the ' world 's first truly flexible battery ' and could be used in a variety of wearable devices			1
it comes after the company had announced a phone with a curved edge and a bendable battery for the @entity14 earlier this year			1
@entity16 tech giant @entity0 has unveiled a flexible battery ( shown )			1
it can bend back upon itself and can even fit around your wrist or a cup			1
the battery is expected to feature heavily in upcoming wearable technology from the company			1

@entity0 's @entity48 , for example , is one of the first phones to have a bendy part to the device - in this case a ' rolled ' side where notifications and alerts can appear			2
' an edge - based display will give @entity0 's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market , ' said @entity62 , an analyst covering the mobile industry at @entity64 in @entity65			2
' but for @entity0 to maximise the potential of an edge display it needs third party apps to support the display with additional @entity0 - specific functions			0
' it is currently only in development and no time frame has been put on when it might be used in actual phones other than a loose term of ' years ' , reports @entity77			0
it can apparently even be rolled up , as well as bent , and is intended to ultimately used in @entity0 's wearable technologies			2
