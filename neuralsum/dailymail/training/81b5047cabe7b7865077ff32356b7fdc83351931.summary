by @entity0 published : 15:01 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 05:54 est , 7 january 2013 a celebrated sculptor is designing a statue in tribute to a doctor who performed pioneering plastic surgery on his father 's burned face saving him from a lifetime of horrendous disfigurement			1
@entity11 ' father @entity10 suffered horrific burns during the @entity13 and was discovered in hospital by surgeon @entity15			1
a lieutenant in the @entity17 he had suffered the devastating effects of a tank blaze in october 1944 which had melted the skin on much of his face and hands			2
tribute : @entity11 ' ( pictured ) father @entity10 was horrifically burned during the @entity13 and was discovered in hospital by surgeon @entity15 who went on to transform his melted face now mr @entity11 , who created the sculpture of sir @entity27 in @entity28 , is creating a lasting memorial to the surgeon , who he credits with saving his father 's life			1
when it 's finished the statue will sit in @entity33 , @entity34 , where @entity35 was based at a small cottage hospital			1
the town became known as ' the town that did not stare ' , as his disfigured and recovering patients went about trying to rebuild their lives			2
mr @entity11 junior , from @entity42 , said he only fully appreciated what @entity35 had done for his father when he visited the hospital recently and saw photographs of his father 's face before and after surgery			1
his father rarely spoke of the devastating blaze but once described the way fire filled the tank as ' like a pentecostal wind ' when the shell hit it			2
he was awarded the @entity55 as he went back to the burning tank to get medication for his men which made his injuries all the worse			0
cheers : sir @entity15 having a drink with a group of his guinea pigs at an early 1940 's reunion party @entity35 had found him bandaged from head to toe with only a hole for his mouth , in a @entity71 hospital and immediately ordered him to be moved to @entity34 where he began to treat him			1
at the time mr @entity11 thought his life was over , but after surgery he remarkably went on to become a teacher and then headmaster , having 11 children in total			1
mr @entity11 junior told the @entity80 : ' without @entity82 none of us might be here '			1
faced with injuries that surgeons at the time had little experience of , @entity85 came up with innovative ways of treating injured airmen who , because of the experimental nature of the work being done on them , became known as @entity94			0
the @entity96 , which by the end of the war had 649 members , was formed and was @entity35 's effort to make life easier for the soldiers by getting them to integrate with local people			0
life - changing : @entity11 ' father as a young serviceman , left , before the blaze and right , after surgery now in their 80s and 90s , they were regularly seen about town defying their injuries , attending dances , drinking in pubs and watching films			1
many went on to marry local girls and nurses who treated them			0
when the war began , the cottage hospital in @entity33 , essentially a prefabricated building , expanded and became known as the @entity124 , establishing a specialist burns centre , which remains so today			1
@entity15 , who died in 1960 aged 60 , created the @entity127 , a medical research centre based at the hospital which specialised in skin wound repair			2
it opened a year after his death			0
@entity133 , chief executive of the foundation , said : ' people in the hospital know of @entity35 and his work but there is no permanent memorial to him in the town which was so much a part of his work and the rehabilitation of these men			0
' many of the techniques @entity35 developed , when plastic surgery was in its infancy , are still used to save the lives of burns patients			2
his major innovation was his method of removing dead skin and replacing it with skin taken from other parts of the patient 's body			0
@entity35 believed cutting away the unhealthy skin within two weeks under anesthetic produced better results - this is something that has become standard procedure			0
the surgeon also recognised the need to deal with the psychological trauma of his patients , many of whom would be in hospital for years			0
