captain @entity0 will not entertain thoughts of a premature @entity3 exit even though a nine - wicket defeat by @entity5 left @entity6 on the brink of disaster			1
@entity6 suffered yet more pain at the @entity10 as centuries from @entity12 and @entity13 inspired a record pursuit of 309 for six			1
defeat leaves @entity6 needing to beat lower - ranked @entity16 and @entity17 in their remaining pool games and , even then , it might not be enough to keep them alive			1
' it 's not even a thought at the moment , ' he said			2
' two games to win to get us into a quarter - final			2
' @entity0 's side never got going in both of those games , but after @entity41 's career - best 121 had put @entity6 in the box seat at the half - way stage , the bowlers posed little threat as @entity12 and @entity13 embarked on an unbeaten 212 - run stand to coast home with 16 balls in hand			1
' it definitely is harder to take , ' @entity0 said			1
' when you do n't turn up for a race like those first two games it 's scratched			2
today when we turn up and we 're beaten in the fashion we were is harder to take			2
' one - day @entity56 ( centre ) leads @entity6 off the pitch in @entity10 after their nine - wicket defeat @entity12 ( left ) and @entity13 helped @entity5 to a comfortable win over @entity6 in @entity61 @entity0 bemoaned a bowling performance in which he claimed @entity6 simply bowled too many bad balls			1
@entity12 certainly agreed , after he had suggested in his earlier press conference that batting against @entity6 's bowlers had been ' very easy '			1
the opener was asked to compare @entity6 's attack to @entity17 , who almost pulled off a stunning win over @entity5 earlier in the tournament , and said : ' to be honest that day @entity17 's bowlers did really well but there was a little bit for the seamers			1
' today it was very easy for me to be honest			0
' @entity0 was at a loss to explain why his bowlers were so ineffective and will wait to see a statistical breakdown of @entity6 's bowling performance in the next couple of days when they will take time off after flying to @entity83			1
@entity12 plays a shot on the way to scoring a century as @entity5 made light work of @entity6 's bowlers @entity12 is almost down on one knee during his knock ( left ) as he celebrates with @entity13 ( right ) ' no. i do n't have a theory yet , ' he said			1
' we bowled a lot of bad balls			0
over the next couple of days we 'll get the @entity95 stuff back and the proof will be in that			0
my feeling is we bowled a lot of bad balls			0
' the skipper denied that the @entity6 attack was too predictable in the light of @entity12 's observations , adding : ' in terms of being too predictable you look at the best sides and they 're predictably good			1
when we 're firing we are predictably good			0
' we 've got two tall guys who are effective , they 've got pace and bounce , and two guys who swing the ball and @entity112 who does his job			0
' when we bowl well we put sides under pressure and create opportunities - today we did n't			0
' @entity41 celebrates after reaching a century against @entity5 , but it was n't enough to secure a win for @entity6 @entity0 , post-match , did not entertain thoughts of an early exit , instead remaining confident of progression @entity6 were not helped by missing opportunities in the field , most significantly when @entity41 grassed a chance at first slip off @entity127 when @entity12 was on just three			1
the @entity5 openers then put on a century stand to pave the way for a chase that easily broke the previous record at the ground - 254 for four achieved by @entity133 against @entity61 three years ago			1
' you can talk about the chances we put down			0
@entity12 was one , ' @entity0 said			1
' it would have brought @entity13 to the wicket earlier with more chance of him getting out			0
he came in an ideal situation			0
' @entity6 have now been soundly beaten by the three sides ranked higher than them in the group and , should they reach the knockout stages , there is apparently a large gap to be bridged if they are to make any impression			2
' losing any game is always a concern , ' @entity0 added			2
@entity149 drops a catch on the boundary as @entity6 failed to build on their score in @entity10 @entity13 and team - mate @entity12 shake hands with @entity0 after @entity5 's nine - wicket win ' over the next few days , we 'll have them off , and then we 'll reconvene			1
me and @entity157 will have a sit down along with the backroom staff and debrief the game and see where we 've gone wrong and how we can get better			0
' @entity0 is confident , though , that he will have no problem in lifting his young squad who now have an eight - day gap to stew over their latest defeat before they meet @entity16 at the @entity166			1
' it 's not a big deal getting those guys up , ' he said			0
' it 's a @entity3 everybody is like a kid at @entity173 , they want to play and they want to win			2
that part of it is easy			0
' it 's simple things moving forward			0
i keep banging on about them because we have n't done them so far this @entity3			2
' the simpler we keep it moving forward , the more obvious what we do or have to do over the next 10 days			0
that will be the message from me to the players			0

@entity5 beat @entity6 by nine wickets at the @entity3
the defeat leaves @entity6 with three losses from their first four matches
@entity0 will not entertain thoughts of a premature @entity3 exit
@entity6 need to beat @entity16 and @entity17 in their final two matches , and even that might not be enough to see them through
