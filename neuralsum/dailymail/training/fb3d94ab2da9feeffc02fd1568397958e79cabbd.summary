high roller : poker star @entity1 netted £ 7.3million playing cards at @entity3 , one of the oldest private casinos in the world			1
but the house has refused to pay out seated at a private gaming table in a @entity10 casino , @entity1 exuded an air of quiet confidence			1
his transfer of £ 1 million into the casino ’s bank account had been a gesture of goodwill , as much as proof that he meant business			1
mr @entity1 , one of the best poker players in the world , was joined by a beautiful @entity24 female friend , whom he hoped would bring him luck			1
perched on a chair overlooking the table , with its neatly stacked rows of chips , decks of cards and dealing shoe , sat the casino ’s inspector , notepad in hand			1
for two nights over the @entity39 at @entity3 , one of the oldest private casinos in the world , the 35 - year - old @entity37 played a relatively simple card game called @entity43			1
the result was a winning streak which resulted in him netting a staggering £ 7.3 million			2
so is he now working out how to spend his winnings ? quite the contrary , for @entity50 has refused to pay up , and has called in investigators from @entity52 , where its owner , the gaming corporation @entity53 , is based			1
they interviewed staff and pored over hour upon hour of surveillance footage			2
they even inspected the cards and dealing shoe used in mr @entity1 ’s game to try to see if anything untoward had contributed to his mammoth win			1
but it is believed no sign of any wrongdoing was found			2
the casino has returned his initial £ 1 million stake , but lawyers for both sides are now locked in an increasingly bitter dispute over the rest of the money			1
strangely , it is not even clear if mr @entity1 has been accused of any wrongdoing			1
the police are not thought to have been contacted			2
the casino ’s insistence on keeping its hands on the money is all the more curious because @entity43 , which @entity1 chose to play , is a skill - free game in which the gambler plays only against the banker , and seeks simply to get a score as close to nine as possible			1
this means that , as with a roulette wheel , it is almost impossible for a player to ‘ fix ’ the outcome			2
at first , the casino had said it would pay the winnings , warning that the @entity39 would stall the payment			1
what eventually stopped it from handing over the money remains a mystery			0
it has emerged that the woman who accompanied the gambler has had her membership of another @entity10 casino suspended , although it is not known why			2
it is now most likely that mr @entity1 and the casino will meet in the @entity106 to settle the matter once and for all			1
at loggerheads : the casino has returned mr @entity1 's £ 1million stake , but lawyers for both sides are now locked in an increasingly bitter dispute the case offers a tantalising glimpse into the world of high - stakes professional gamblers — one which might almost be taken from the pages of @entity121 ’s novel @entity122			1
but @entity123 was never refused his winnings by a casino — so why would anyone else be ? @entity127 , author of @entity128 , believes that because mr @entity1 is a very wealthy man — he won £ 10 million in just one @entity130 poker tournament — he was able to continue to play for so long that he encountered a statistically unusual run of winning hands			1
indeed , when he was at @entity133 and betting £ 50,000 a hand , his losses hit £ 500,000 before his fortunes changed			0
‘ i do n’t think for one minute that he cheated , ’ says @entity127			0
‘ it is almost impossible for him to have an influence in a game of pure chance like @entity43			1
‘ just because it ’s statistically unlikely does n’t mean you ca n’t have such a long winning streak — it is the nature of probability			0
‘ he comes to the attention of casino bosses because he is considered the best poker player in the world , and people wrongly think he may have some edge in other card games , too			1
’ mr @entity127 believes the casino will have to pay the cash at some point , adding that the reason they can delay paying such a large sum is that the industry is not licensed as tightly as some other businesses			1
over the years , professional gamblers who have developed some kind of system to boost their odds have been barred from casinos or had a cap imposed on the size of bets they can place			0
high stakes : doormen stand at the entrance to @entity3 in @entity10 , @entity174 , where mr @entity1 played for two nights over the @entity39 card counting is the most common technique , where the punter keeps an eagle eye on the cards that have already been dealt and memorises them , so he knows what remains			1
he can then make an informed bet on what is going to be dealt next			0
when @entity188 , for example , a 49 - year - old @entity186 professional gambler , arrives at a casino , he strikes fear into the management			2
he is already barred from two @entity130 casinos — and in 2010 won more than £ 4 million from two @entity194 casinos playing blackjack			1
last year , a 12 - hour session at another saw him walk away with more than £ 3 million			0
( the boss was promptly sacked			0
) while no one knows what system he uses , he puts his success down to having the cash to keep going when he has suffered setbacks			0
‘ you also have to understand the maths , ’ mr @entity188 has said			2
‘ i ’m not breaking any laws			0
i ’m beating them with my own skills			0
’ there are those , however , who have relied on cunning to break the law and steal millions of pounds from casinos in cons worthy of the @entity216 films			0
in 2007 , two @entity218 men and a woman were discovered using miniature cameras woven into a suit sleeve and a handbag to film the croupier dealing at a @entity174 casino			2
the images were beamed to a man holed up in van parked outside , who would freeze each frame to identify the cards on the table			0
then , using a radio link , he relayed the details to his accomplices , who were wearing tiny earpieces			0
the gang were eventually arrested at the @entity237 casino in @entity238 and later jailed			2
some attempts to cheat the bank are a little more mundane			0
in 2009 , two men named @entity242 and @entity243 wore various wigs and false moustaches to visit casinos in @entity174			0
they relied on a friend watching their poker games to spill his drink or strike up idle chat to divert the attention of the croupier			2
in that split second , the two men would swap cards between them to produce a stronger hand			0
seven times they executed the deft manoeuvre , banking more than £ 5,000			0
mystery : at first , the casino ( pictured ) had said it would pay mr @entity1 's winnings			1
what eventually stopped it from handing over the money remains unclear while it was difficult to spot with the naked eye , the slow - motion playback from the @entity266 recordings at the @entity267 in @entity174 ’s @entity268 made compelling viewing for security staff			0
inevitably , casinos have invested millions of pounds on a variety of surveillance techniques to catch cheats			0
every roulette and card table has a sensitive microphone recording conversations , while a series of so - called ‘ pan-tilt - zoom ’ cameras record in high definition every twitch of players , audience and croupiers alike			1
to prevent cards from being marked , new packs are opened at the start of each business day , and shredded at the end			0
in a game like @entity43 , casino inspectors like the one watching @entity1 in his private gaming room at @entity3 look out for patterns of low bets followed by a flurry of high bets , suggesting that the punter is somehow in the know about what cards are due to come up			1
in this game , too , a brilliant mathematical mind can attempt mentally to record what has already been dealt , and place bets based on those odds of the card they need turning up			1
criminal gangs may try to secure the services of someone on the inside			0
a year ago , for example , three @entity315 were charged with fraud after apparently wearing special contact lenses to read invisible ink on cards marked by a @entity322 croupier			0
in one @entity325 casino , the men made more than £ 50,000 after using the specially treated lenses to see the marks ( a cross for a king and a line for an ace )			2
they all denied the accusations			0
with such sophisticated attempts to break the rules , it is little wonder that casinos harbour a natural suspicion of those who win substantial sums at their tables			0
and for the same reason , disputes over unpaid winnings do happen , though very rarely			0
as yet , of course , there is no suggestion that @entity1 is guilty of anything other than a lucky streak			1

poker player @entity1 won a fortune playing card game @entity43
but casino @entity50 is refusing to pay up and has called in investigators
mr @entity1 and the casino will meet in the @entity106 to settle the matter
