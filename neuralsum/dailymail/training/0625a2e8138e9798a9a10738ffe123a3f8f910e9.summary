while other dogs might come running at the sound of the tin opener , @entity0 was so overweight he could barely walk to the kitchen – and even went deaf			1
but that did n’t stop him from getting through three tins of dog food a day , as well as plenty of treats and leftovers			0
his unhealthy diet meant he tipped the scales in excess of three stone – more than double the ideal weight for his breed			1
if he is lucky , he will get some cooked vegetables as a treat with his evening meal exercise : walks every morning and almost every evening weight : 31lbs now , however , the eight - year - old has shed a third of his body weight and trimmed an impressive eight inches from his waist			1
and yesterday , @entity0 was named pet slimming champion in a competition organised by veterinary charity pdsa			1
owner @entity68 , 52 , who adopted ‘ @entity69 ’ in january , said he came to her having been over-fed and barely exercised			1
his vast intake of treats and goodies led to deafness as fat blocked his ear canals , and his weight prevented him from walking more than a few steps			0
mrs @entity68 said : ‘ the vet said that he was morbidly obese and would die unless he started an immediate diet			2
‘ as far as we were aware the previous owners simply left him from 5am until 6pm every day			0
when he came to us he could n’t walk , hear , bark or play			2
’ feline figure : @entity84 , an eight - year - old rescue cat from @entity86 , is now almost unrecognisable after losing 4.4lbs and now weighs a healthier 16lb bloated bunny : greedy rabbit @entity89 , a four - year - old mini-lop from @entity92 who stole her partner 's food , drop a third of her bodyweight but following a strict six - month diet and fitness regime , @entity0 can now do all of those things			1
mrs @entity68 , from @entity101 , north - west @entity102 , added : ‘ today he is a different dog			2
he is fit , healthy and happy			2
’ the competition saw 17 obese pets lose 13.5 stone between them – the equivalent of around 28 healthy @entity110 terriers			1
but while @entity0 was happy to winalot , his was not the only success story			0
before : @entity112 , from @entity113 before joining @entity114 after : @entity112 has been highly commended by @entity114 , after he lost 29 per cent of his body weight , which equates to 6.9kg purrfect contestant : @entity117 lost 23 per cent of his body weight on @entity114 @entity84 , an eight - year - old rescue cat from @entity86 , is now almost unrecognisable as the feline who first entered the vets			1
she lost 4.4lbs and now weighs a healthier 16lb			0
she was rescued as a starving kitten by her first owner and it was this early experience that is being blamed for her over-eating			0
she gorged on extra meals from neighbours - and even stole bird food from the garden			2
her weight ballooned until she was morbidly obese			0
but since dieting she is much more active and playful			0
too many treats : @entity133 before entering the competition @entity135 's better : @entity133 lost 16 per cent of her body weight after being put on a strict diet and having plenty of exercise hot dog : @entity142 lost 26 per cent of her bodyweight			1
all the animals taking part shed a total of 13.5st betwen them ditching that paunch : @entity149 has lost 16 per cent of his body mass six - year - old cocker spaniel @entity112 's huge bulk meant he struggled to climb stairs			1
but he has since shed 15.2lb and is now a trim 36.6lb			0
the slimming competition also saw greedy rabbit @entity89 , a four - year - old mini-lop from @entity92 who stole her partner 's food , drop a third of her bodyweight			1
she was so fat the roll of skin under her chin grew so big she had difficulty grooming herself			0
