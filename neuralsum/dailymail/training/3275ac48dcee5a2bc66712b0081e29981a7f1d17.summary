by @entity1 reporter last updated at 11:57 am on 16th february 2012 @entity2 was the first @entity4 air force officer was killed in @entity5 , following @entity4 's entry into @entity7 this is the face of a forgotten hero - the first @entity4 air force officer killed in @entity5 after @entity4 's entry into the @entity7			1
fighter pilot lt col @entity2 was highly regarded by the military but his name was , until now , virtually lost to history			1
he was the first of 30,000 @entity4 airmen to lose their lives in the bloody conflict - shot down in friendly fire after the plane he travelling in was tragically mistaken for a @entity23 aircraft on february 15 1942 on its way from @entity25 to the @entity26			1
now , on the 70th anniversary of his death this week , his contribution to the war effort is being remembered in a feature for the @entity33 's online news magazine			0
his death at 41 led to improved training for airmen to help them recognise the differences between military and civilian aircraft			1
he also helped establish a key supply route across @entity42 for @entity4 lend - lease aircraft			1
there is no memorial to lt col @entity2 in the @entity26 , although the @entity47 named their @entity26 headquarters after him , @entity49 , at the @entity51 end of @entity52 , in west @entity53 , which has now been demolished			1
another airbase in @entity55 was also named after him			0
born in @entity56 in @entity57 to a wealthy well - to - do family lt col @entity2 was a keen polo player			1
he trained as a fighter pilot and served in @entity60 in the 1920s			0
after being posted to bases in @entity57 and @entity63 he worked in @entity64 and @entity65 as an air attache from 1935			0
between 1936 and 1938 he excelled in his observations and analysis of the civil war in @entity70			0
this was seen as a way to test military technologies and the @entity4 government wanted information on how aircraft and tanks were used and deployed			1
in september 1940 the @entity4 had agreed to help @entity26 in the conflict and provide the nation with 50 naval destroyers in return for the lease of military bases in various territories			1
a b - 24 liberator in flight			2
@entity2 travelled to @entity87 and then to @entity25 where he boarded an unarmed b - 24 liberator to the @entity26 operated by the @entity89 @entity90 , pictured later became one of the most familiar heavy bombers used by @entity4 airmen , but at the time of @entity2 's death there were not many around following his stint in @entity70 and another stint in the @entity4 he arrived in @entity53 at the @entity99 , in 1941 , becoming a special observer unofficially preparing for the military alliance with @entity26 following @entity102			1
his aide was gen @entity104			0
however , in november that year , he left his post and was sent to @entity106 to work with the @entity108 government trying to negotiate the opening of a @entity42 supply route for @entity4 lend - lease aircraft			1
the existing route to @entity113 from the @entity26 was via the @entity114 which took longer			2
despite two months of conversations with @entity113 , his bid to create the new delivery route failed , but bad weather meant it was impossible for him to return to @entity26 straight away			2
it was the start of a series of events which led to his death , following which he was awarded the @entity125			0
he travelled to @entity87 and then to @entity25 where he boarded an unarmed b - 24 liberator to the @entity26 operated by the @entity89			0
a tablet memorial marking the various blocks of @entity49 , the @entity26 headquarters of the @entity47 , in @entity52 , west @entity53 this type of plane later became one of the most familiar heavy bombers used by @entity4 airmen but at the time there were not many around			2
the flight was the first of its kind and was fraught with delays due to strong winds which meant it would have run out of fuel on its route across the @entity143 and around @entity144			0
the captain eventually suggested a direct route across occupied @entity5 at night and it took off on @entity148 even though a message from @entity150 stating it was against the flight got lost amid conflicting communications			0
the @entity47 memorial in @entity52 in west @entity53 where the @entity47 had their @entity26 headquarters named @entity49 the plane reached the coast of northern @entity157 and registered as hostile on @entity26 radar screens			0
it was shot down by two spitfires from a @entity162 @entity47 squadron based in @entity163 who mistook it for a @entity23 @entity167 200 aircraft and everyone on board was killed , including @entity2 , a brigadier of the @entity170 , a @entity172 lieutenant and a @entity174 employee			2
following the tragedy it was realised that fighter pilots needed more training in recognising the differences between military and civilian aircraft			1
it was also a cause of great embarrassment to the @entity183 and the air chief marshal @entity184 wrote to gen @entity185 to ease the situation			0
he was described as an ' outstanding officer ' and the citation on his @entity125 said he displayed ' rare judgement and devotion to duty ' and ' contributed materially to the the successful operation of the @entity194 , @entity53 '			0
months after his death the @entity108 authorities changed their mind on the supply route lt col @entity200 had been trying to set up and in the summer of that year it became the main route for @entity4 deliveries to @entity113			1
