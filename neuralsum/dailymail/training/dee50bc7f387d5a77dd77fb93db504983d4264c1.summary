every year about 1,000 people in the @entity1 die due to the lack of transplant organs			2
this shortage is increasingly being addressed by so - called living donations , typically family members donating a kidney			1
but what happens if it goes wrong ? @entity10 , 45 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , received a kidney from his sister , @entity14 , eight years ago , only for it to fail less than two years later			1
here , he tells his story			2
to be told i had kidney failure was a big shock			1
i wondered whether i 'd ever work again ( i run an air - conditioning business ) and even if my wife might leave me			1
fortunately , @entity22 has been incredibly supportive , but those things go through your mind			2
i 'd become ill while on holiday in @entity27 with @entity22 in 2005			0
i remember my urine being very dark , and feeling so dehydrated that i was unable to leave my room			0
and i was doubled over in pain			0
i thought it was due to drinking alcohol in the heat			0
a local doctor advised me to take a blood test when i got home			0
@entity10 pictured with his sister @entity37 , who donated one of her kidneys to him i did this then had a call the next day from my gp who told me to go straight to hospital , making me panic			1
being a smoker , i thought i had cancer			0
i 'd never been seriously ill and was a healthy weight			0
the diagnosis was acute renal failure brought about by @entity51 , a condition in which the immune system damages the kidneys			1
doctors are n't clear why this happens			1
i was told that my best option would be a transplant			1
when my mother @entity61 , brother @entity62 , and sister @entity14 found out , they immediately wanted to help			1
they were tested for compatibility and only @entity14 was a match			1
@entity14 and i are pretty close			1
she used to be my bossy older sister			1
i did n't ask her to donate a kidney - she was adamant she wanted to			1
back then , they would only consider relatives or long - term friends , although that 's changed - anyone who 's suitable can become a living donor , but you have to prove people are n't getting paid			1
@entity14 's husband , @entity77 , was very worried about her and i know he asked her if she was sure she was doing the right thing			1
the doctors said i 'd need regular dialysis within three years without a transplant , but i deteriorated fast and needed it within six months			1
my kidney function plunged from 50 per cent to 10 per cent - classed as failure - in that time			1
@entity10 at 18 months and @entity14 at age 7 1/2 dialysis is gruelling			1
i can lose three kilos of fluid in three hours - imagine doing that five times a week			0
i 've seen a 30 stone body builder turn up for his first dialysis session in tears			0
by the time of the donation i felt tired all the time and used to vomit almost every morning due to the toxins in my system			0
sometimes i could n't get out of bed for two weeks			1
we had the operations in august 2006 and the new kidney worked immediately			2
i felt great the next day			0
i was in pain from the surgery but my mind was clear			0
the level of toxins in my blood had fallen dramatically			0
there was no reason to remove my failed kidneys , so i have three			2
@entity14 was in a lot of pain afterwards , more so than me , because of the location of the kidneys , near the back			1
the kidney was put in at the front of my body , which is less intrusive			2
it 's hard to describe how grateful i felt to @entity14			1
it was so brave of her			0
there 's no way to repay something like that			0
people said the old @entity10 was back , and i got back the 20 hours a week i 'd lost to dialysis			1
i felt well enough to start a family with @entity128 , and we now have two boys , @entity131 , five , and @entity132 , three			0
i also have two grown - up sons from a previous relationship			0
unfortunately , my body started rejecting @entity14 's kidney after less than two years			1
i put on weight due to fluid building up because the kidney was n't working properly			1
i had a reduced urine output and my blood pressure increased			0
live donations last on average 15 years so we were unfortunate			2
i was devastated for @entity14 after the sacrifices she made			1
but she 's never said she 's had a problem with it			0
during a hospital stay for treatment to try to extend the life of the kidney , i had a seizure and went into a coma for three weeks			2
i bit through my tongue and the blood would n't clot due to the anti-rejection drugs i was on			2
my tongue swelled up and blocked my airways and @entity128 got a call in the early hours to say i 'd be having an emergency tracheostomy - a hole cut in my throat to enable me to breathe			2
they could n't guarantee i 'd survive the night			2
it was a slow recovery after that			0
i 'd been fed through a tube in my nose and had to learn to eat again			0
my muscles were so weak i had to walk with a frame			0
i had to start dialysis again , which was depressing			0
i 'm on the list for organ donation but there 's no guarantee			2
the system for organ donations from people who have died should be changed to an opt - out system			2
the opt - in system sees many organs wasted			2
my wife would like to donate a kidney to me but is n't a match			1
however , she might be able to donate to someone else via a pooling system			2
we 'd get an organ back in exchange			1
i 'm getting on board with the idea but i 'd much rather use a kidney that would otherwise be wasted than put @entity128 through what @entity14 endured			1
@entity37 , 50 , is a hairdresser who lives in @entity11 with her husband @entity77 , their daughter @entity193 , 15 , and her son @entity195 , 23 , from a previous marriage			1
as children , @entity10 and i did n't always get on			1
he once threw an ashtray at me and i threw a boot back			0
we were quite argumentative and each wanted the last word			0
but once i 'd left home at 19 i became close to him and our brother @entity62			0
when i found out @entity10 was ill it was devastating			1
i visited him in hospital straight away			0
i remember crying a lot			0
he deteriorated quickly - it was shocking			0
his colour changed completely ; he went yellow			0
it was my idea to donate a kidney			1
when you see your brother that ill you do n't need to think about @entity217 had to undergo tests for about a year before donating			2
@entity10 kept saying : ' you do n't have to do this			1
' in the end i told him to shut up ! i was told beforehand you can live perfectly well with one kidney , but as part of the preparation i had to see a counsellor			1
i was asked to consider that if i was in a serious accident affecting the remaining kidney i 'd have no back up			2
but i wanted to help @entity10 , not worry about things unlikely to happen			1
my husband said he 'd rather i did n't do it but did n't try to change my mind , and my children were a bit frightened			2
but we explained @entity236 was very poorly and what was going to happen			0
on the day of the operation emotions were running high			0
when i was in theatre my husband panicked when it overran and had to be reassured by the nurses that i was coming back			0
@entity10 and i were in the same wards throughout the procedure			1
immediately after the operations our roles were reversed because he was sprightly and i was exhausted			0
@entity10 , pictured in his early 20s on holiday camp with @entity14 , who was devastated to discover he was ill he sat on my bed because i could n't move very well			1
i told him off when he made me laugh because it hurt			2
it was so good to see him well			0
we 'd joke that he might start acting like me now that he had part of my body inside him , plucking his eyebrows or something			0
@entity10 stayed in hospital a couple of days longer than me			1
the day i went home was emotional because we 'd been together for about a week , which was the most time we had spent together since childhood			0
after my operation i needed strong painkillers , then paracetamol			0
it was awkward for a while walking upstairs , getting in the shower and sleeping			0
i 've got quite a long scar on the left side , and i get a bit of numbness there			0
but i cope fine with one kidney			2
when i heard that @entity10 's body was rejecting my kidney i was devastated for him - he 'd just started to live a normal life			1
@entity128 was pregnant at the time , so it was very traumatic			0
i remember her saying to me : ' obviously we ca n't save the kidney , ' but i said : ' @entity281 , i 'm not worried about that			1
' we nearly lost @entity10			1
he was annoyed and upset that his body rejected my kidney			2
he kept saying that if he 'd known , he would n't have let me donate			1
but i just wanted him to live			0
i carry a @entity284 so other parts of my body can be used when i die			0
i only realised how important it is to donate when my brother 's life was at stake			2

@entity10 , 45 , from @entity11 , was told he had kidney failure
he received a kidney from his sister , @entity14 , but it failed in less than two years
his wife would like to donate a kidney to him but is n't a match
she might be able to donate to someone else in exchange for an organ
but he would rather use a kidney that would otherwise be wasted
