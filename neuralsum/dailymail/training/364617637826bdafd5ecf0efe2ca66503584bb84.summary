by @entity0 a motorcyclist involved in an accident shocked doctors when his heart rotated in his chest			1
the 48 - year - old @entity7 man was rushed to a hospital ’s emergency department after being involved in the crash			1
upon his arrival , doctors tried to listen to his heart			1
doctors in @entity7 were amazed when a motorbike crash caused a man 's heart to rotate 90 degrees to the right			1
x-ray ( left ) shows the heart after it had rotated and ( right ) shows it back in its normal position 24 hours later it was then they discovered it was in an unusual place , @entity21 reports			2
they x-rayed the man ’s chest and carried out a ct scan which revealed that his heart had rotated 90 degrees to the right and was sitting on the right side of his chest			1
they also noted his aorta and pulmonary artery had rotated to the right			0
the man had also suffered numerous broken ribs , a collapsed lung , bruising to both lungs and a ruptured spleen , according to a report on the case in the @entity43			0
however , despite this , he was conscious and the only signs of his heart problems were a slight drop in his blood pressure and a slight increase in his heart rate			0
dr @entity51 , chairman of the department of cardiothoracic surgery at @entity54 in @entity55 , who was not involved in this patient ’s case , explained his theory to live science			0
he believes the heart turned in the minutes after the crash			1
he said it is extremely unusual and even more surprising that the patient was alert and conscious - despite such a significant injury			0
the 48 - year - old man 's major vessels also rotated after the crash			1
image ( left ) shows them after the rotation and ( right ) once they had returned to their normal position he suggested damage to the motorcyclist ’s lungs may have meant that air seeped into his chest cavity			2
if air had built up in his chest , this could have forced the heart to turn to the right			1
amazingly , the man survived the horrific injury and his heart returned to its normal position the next day , report doctors from the @entity89 , @entity7			1
once the air was removed for the patient ’s chest , his heart returned to its normal position			2
amazingly , further tests showed the man 's heart had suffered no lasting damage – none of the blood vessels had torn and the valves were functioning normally			2
the patient did , however , have to have emergency surgery to remove his spleen			0
the @entity7 patient is not the first to have a bizarre heart condition reported in the @entity43			2
last year , the journal reported the case of a woman whose serious heart condition was diagnosed after her heart started pulsating violently			2
last year the @entity43 ran a report on the case of a @entity112 woman whose serious heart condition was diagnosed after her neck ( pictured ) started to pulsate violently the 33 - year - old @entity112 woman ’s abnormal pulse alerted doctors to the fact she had a condition caused by a faulty heart valve			1
she was diagnosed with the heart condition tricuspid regurgitation			0
tricuspid regurgitation is a condition which occurs when the heart 's tricuspid valve does not close properly , meaning blood can flow backwards into the right upper heart chamber when the right lower heart chamber contracts			0
the valve separates the right lower heart chamber from the right upper heart chamber			0
when it is faulty the pressure in the blood vessels can change			0
this can lead to the abnormal pulses seen in the @entity112 patient ’s neck .			0

the 48 - year - old in @entity7 was rushed to hospital after the crash
when doctors tried to listen to his heart they found it had moved
scans showed it had rotated 90 degrees to the right in his chest
they think air leaked from his damaged lungs and forced it to turn
after the air was *drained* from his chest , the heart turned back again
