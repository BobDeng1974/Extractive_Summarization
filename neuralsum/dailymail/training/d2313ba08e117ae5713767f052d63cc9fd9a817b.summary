studying for a phd in engineering at @entity3 , she might not seem like a prime candidate to enter into a polygamous marriage			1
but that is what @entity7 did , dropping out of university to become the second woman married to businessman @entity11 who has since acquired a third wife			1
yesterday it emerged that mrs @entity7 , from @entity14 , is among thousands of @entity16 women entering into such relationships which are illegal in the @entity18 but allowed under sharia law which permits men to have four wives			1
having already been through a divorce , @entity7 , originally from @entity30 , signed up to a similar matrimony service specifically looking for a married man @entity11 and his three wives @entity7 35 , @entity27 33 , and @entity28 41 @entity33 a new television documentary , the men with many wives , exposes the rise in these unions – of which there are believed to be as many as 20,000 in @entity18 – and the dating agency , @entity41 , responsible for setting many of them up			1
the couple were interviewed in this week 's @entity45 having already been through a divorce mrs @entity7 , 35 , originally from @entity30 , signed up to a similar matrimony service specifically looking for a married man			1
she told the programme : ‘ i was looking for someone who had been married or was already in a marriage			0
‘ i was married before and having gone through one divorce , you kind of know what you want in marriage , so i wanted someone who already knows how to be a husband			0
‘ i really enjoy being in a polygamous relationship			0
we are not stupid people who are forced into this type of relationship			0
’ through the service she signed up to she met 32 - year - old mr @entity11 – also divorced but re-married to @entity64 worker @entity27 , 33 , – and decided to abandon her studies to become his second wife			1
the wives occasionally meet when mr @entity11 , who as well as being a businessman also works for a charity aiming to spread the word of @entity16 , organises family outings			1
@entity7 said : ‘ if any problem happens between co-wives it ’s usually his fault			1
“ why do n’t you be more like her , she ’s this , she ’s that ”			0
if he did n’t say that , we would all be happy			0
’ she has two children with mr @entity11 , who has six in total , and helps to run his import - export business			2
but abandoning her high - flying academic career was not her only change after she married			0
she also began wearing the @entity16 veil , the niqab			2

he did not invite his other two wives to the small ceremony , held at the local mosque , saying : ‘ i do n’t think it would be right to invite them			0

’ each wife lives in a separate house in @entity14 and mr @entity11 spends three nights in each home before moving on to the next			2
the programme , to be broadcast at 10pm next wednesday on @entity33 , also speaks to @entity118 , who claims to have more than 50,000 clients on the books of @entity41 , which appears to facilitate polygamous marriages			2
he said the popularity of such arrangements is driven by the women who are having difficulty finding a husband , and admits that while these women are looking for security , many of the men have baser motives			2
he said : ‘ most men who want to do polygamy , probably 80 per cent , it ’s a sexually driven thing			0
