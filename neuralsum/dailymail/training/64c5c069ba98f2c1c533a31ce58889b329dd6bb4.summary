by @entity0 published : 16:03 est , 21 april 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 22 april 2012 thursday was a day off school for @entity2 , who spent the morning watching her favourite cartoon shows on television			1
but at 1pm she switched channel for the lunchtime news			1
she knew she was n’t supposed to , but she could n’t help herself			2
@entity2 ’s parents had told her not to watch , desperate to protect her from hearing anything about the gangland shooting that has left her paralysed from the chest down			1
but last week was an important turning point in @entity2 ’s short life			1
not only did she return to school for the first time since the incident a year ago , but the three men convicted over the attack on her were sentenced at the @entity20			2
still smiling : @entity2 on her special mobility bike with her parents and sister @entity23 @entity2 , who has suffered from nightmares that the trio would return to ‘ get my brother and sister ’ , wanted to know the instant a decision had been made about how much time the ‘ bad men ’ , as she refers to them , would spend in jail			1
the six - year - old , who wants to be a doctor when she grows up , concentrated hard as the newsreader announced that a judge had given them life sentences			2
@entity2 immediately phoned her parents , who were at the @entity20 , and asked her mother @entity39 : ‘ does that mean they will die in jail ? ’ @entity39 , 35 , told her that the gang would eventually be released , but not for many years			1
‘ when i heard they would go to prison for life , i thought it meant their whole lives , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ my mum has explained that it does n’t mean until they die , but i know they wo n’t be able to come out for a really long time			2
‘ she told me that everyone involved was very happy that the men were going to jail			1
i ’m also very happy that they wo n’t be able to hurt any more people			2
but they are nasty men and they never even said they were sorry for hurting me			2
’ @entity2 ’s life changed in an instant in march last year as she played in the aisles of her uncle ’s convenience store in @entity64 , @entity65			1
@entity67 pictures showed her being pushed aside as two men ran into the store , trying to escape from three men outside			2
shots were then fired into the shop			2
caged : @entity73 , who fired the gun at @entity2 ( left ) ; @entity75 ( centre ) ; and @entity77 @entity2 , in her red school uniform , collapsed after a bullet hit her in the chest and damaged her spine			1
her heart stopped twice and she had to be revived by paramedics before three operations at @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity65 , saved her			2
it was three weeks before her parents were told she would never walk again and a year before @entity2 was released back into their care from the experts in spinal injuries at @entity92 , @entity93			1
the three men in court were @entity73 , 21 , @entity96 , 19 , and @entity75 , 20			2
@entity73 , who fired the gun , will serve a minimum of 17½ years			2
@entity75 and @entity96 will each spend at least 14½ years in prison			0
while @entity2 is relieved that the ‘ bad men ’ who hurt her are no longer a threat , her parents are angry that they could be back walking the streets when they are still only in their 30s			1
@entity39 said : ‘ i felt the sentence was lenient			0
@entity2 is in a wheelchair , probably for the rest of her life			1
it is a life sentence for her , but if these guys are released they will still be relatively young and able to live active lives			0
‘ it ’s hard for me to see my child who was once so happy now in a wheelchair			0
i ’ve shed many tears over it			0
so , of course , we would like life to mean life , but we have our faith in the @entity126 justice system and it only works if we can be strong enough to accept the results			0
’ @entity2 ’s father @entity128 , 37 , who is known as @entity129 , said : ‘ they have shown no remorse			1
during the sentencing i kept looking at them , but they did n’t look at us			0
i suspect they did n’t have the guts to look us in the eyes			0
i ’m frustrated that they will always be able to walk , run and move			0
@entity2 wo n’t be able to			1
‘ we wanted to scream at them , but if we had ranted and raved , then there would have been no difference between us and those brutes			0
’ split second before : @entity67 showed @entity2 dancing in the aisle of her uncle 's shop @entity149 : the intended victim of the hit and another youth come into the store ( left )			1
@entity2 and her family can be seen at the front of the picture on the right panic : as the gunman standing outside the shop starts to fire , @entity2 's family run for cover gunned down : @entity2 's family move out of the way to reveal the little girl lying on the floor ( left )			1
her uncle @entity166 is seen rushing to help her ( right ) as the shooting stops pitiful : he lifts her limp form from the floor and carries her to safety			1
@entity2 's heart stopped twice on the way to hospital and paramedics feared she would die @entity129 has left his job at a factory making plastic milk bottles to help his wife care for @entity2 , who is being eased back into a school routine for two hours a day , two days a week before she returns full - time later this year			1
@entity2 has had to start a new school because her old one did n’t have enough wheelchair access			1
‘ i ’ve got a new uniform , which is blue , and although i miss my old friends i hope i ’ll make lots of new ones from my class , ’ she said			0
‘ i love being back in lessons			0
‘ my dad ’s been helping me this week and staying with me while i get used to school			0
i was a bit nervous about going back and quite shy at first			0
i know i will get used to going to school again			0
i have really missed it while i have been ill and i want to learn and pass my tests so i can be a doctor when i grow up			0
’ despite her injuries , @entity2 remains fiercely independent and is determined to help out around the house			1
her father said : ‘ she will often come into the kitchen and ask her mum if she needs any help			0
she ’ll volunteer to chop up the vegetables or help with the cooking			0
she has such a sweet nature			0
’ the couple have been touched by the public ’s response to their daughter ’s plight – thousands of well - wishers have donated £ 140,000 to a fund aimed at helping to pay for future medical treatment for her			0
@entity39 said : ‘ sometimes things can seem very grim , but we can not allow ourselves to become bitter			0
‘ we have to believe that there are enough decent people out there , and the response has shown us that there are			0

@entity2 's parents had told her not to watch the news , to protect her from hearing about the gangland shooting that left her paralysed
