@entity1 running back @entity0 ( centre ) is set to return from injury against @entity20 ‘ this week i feel great : punching , doing everything , taking care of the ball with my right hand			1
‘ if it was up to me i would have played two weeks ago , but obviously i do n’t have the final say here , so it ’s one of those deals			0
’ head coach @entity29 backed up @entity0 , adding : ‘ i think he ’s in a better spot now than he was two weeks ago and even where he was last week			2
signs are pointing that he ’s going to be ready to go for this weekend			0

‘ they ’re a fast defense			0
the linebackers do a great job when they blitz			0
they use their hands well , which is something for a guy with not long arms you ’ve got to be able to get into the body a little bit , so that ’s something we ’ve worked on this week			0
’ running back @entity0 # 21 of the @entity1 has a short gain against the @entity38 ‘ and then how they tackle			1
their defensive line does a great job of getting penetration so being able to get around the defensive line up to the second level and make people miss. ’ with the @entity1 desperate to kick - start their season before the bye , @entity0 - @entity0 ‘ the last couple of weeks have been hard on us , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i know @entity10 ’s doing a great job , but it ’s been kind of hard for us to get the running game going			2
