by @entity0 a third of strip club dancers are students who are increasingly likely to come from middle - class families , a study shows			1
they have become a ‘ core supply group into the sex industries ’ , with clubs even attempting to recruit pretty girls during university freshers ’ week events			0
researchers say that the ‘ normalisation of porn ’ and the rise of ‘ raunch culture ’ have led to sexual services such as stripping increasingly being viewed as respectable , particularly among the middle - classes			1
extra-curricular : almost a third of strip club workers are now students , according to a recent study			0
some are middle - class and see the cash - in - hand work as a ' bonus ' while others need to make ends meet some students are secretly joining the industry because they are excited about experiencing a ‘ forbidden occupation ’ and enjoy the party atmosphere of the clubs			1
they consider earning cash in hand ‘ a bonus ’ , while other less affluent students are working in strip clubs to help pay for their education			2
the study was carried out by @entity45 academics dr @entity46 , a reader in sociology , and dr @entity49 , a lecturer in work and employment relations			1
they interviewed almost 200 dancers from pubs and strip clubs across the @entity56 and found that 29.4 per cent were students			1
dr @entity46 told the @entity60 magazine : ‘ many of these dancers are from middle - class backgrounds – they are not coming from families where money is a big issue			1
’ one student told the study : ' it 's just like party night ! i prefer to go to work than go out on a weekend ' a number of the students saw themselves as dancers , not sex workers , because ‘ selling striptease had become more palatable and socially acceptable ’			2
dr @entity46 added : ‘ they enjoyed dressing up to go out and many say it was n’t too different to heading out on a night out			0
’ their study , published by the @entity83 , claimed that there was a ‘ growing acceptance and normalisation of sex work among undergraduate students in the @entity56 ’			1
it said : ‘ student dancers often saw the financial aspect as only one of the advantages to the work ; being in a party atmosphere and part of the night - time economy was often a significant attraction			1
the decisions to enter the industry are complex , not only driven by financial incentive but also by the desire to engage in a “ forbidden ” occupation			2
‘ students often started dancing with friends as a joint venture , drawn in by the initial excitement of engaging in a transgressive world , and the prospect of earning cash in hand on the night was considered a bonus			0
’ however , the study found conflicting attitudes between student strippers and other girls			0
it said : ‘ there was a definite tension between the “ old school ” dancers who were there to earn good money and not socialise , and the new , inexperienced younger women who had a range of motives for entering stripping			0
’ a 34 - year - old dancer called @entity129 told researchers : ‘ there ’s kind of the student group that maybe might kind of work from time to time			1
they see it as an extra boost of cash but ( they are ) not necessarily amazing at the job ‘ cos they do n’t do it enough to really know how to work			0
’ one 23 - year - old student , identified as @entity144 , told researchers : ‘ it ’s like – just like party night ! i prefer to go to work than go out on a weekend really			2
’ another student , @entity147 , 27 , said the work was ‘ sociable ’ and she liked to ‘ catch up with everyone ’			0
many of the students had begun working in clubs after visiting as a customer or starting off doing bar work in the venue			0
a club manager in a northern city said he put flyers out at freshers ’ week events , inviting female students to audition			0
he claimed that september – when students return to campuses – is a ‘ peak time for requests from experienced and inexperienced dancers alike to work a shift ’ .			2

some are middle - class and join industry to experience a ' forbidden ' world
others are less well - off and use the work to pay for their studies
@entity45 researchers interviewed almost 200 dancers across @entity56
