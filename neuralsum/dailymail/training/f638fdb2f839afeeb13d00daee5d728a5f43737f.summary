‘ this is a man who made this country what it is by going to war so you would think he ’d be worth 42p a day			0
’ mr @entity7 , who has four grandchildren and two great grandchildren , maintained yesterday that he would not pay the new charge because it had been ‘ thrust upon him ’ and had not been part of his agreement when he moved in			1
