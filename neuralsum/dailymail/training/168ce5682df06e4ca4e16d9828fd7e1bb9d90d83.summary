by @entity0 last week @entity1 made himself a cup of tea for the first time in more than two years			1
' i did n’t pour boiling water on myself which was the main objective , ' he said			2
the @entity7 father - of - four had all his limbs amputated in june 2012 after suffering from a severe case of toxic shock syndrome which almost claimed his life			1
he had contracted @entity19 , which resulted in toxic shock syndrome and led to all four of his limbs being amputated his wife @entity23 was told that if @entity1 was to stand any chance of survival , they would have to amputate all four of his limbs			1
she told them to proceed with the operation – the first of its kind at the hospital – and he survived			2
now , @entity1 , 41 , is well on his way to another medical first _ becoming the world 's first ' bionic man '			1
there was not enough left of his limbs for conventional prosthetics to work properly and so he has been fitted with steel implants into his bone , which protrude through his skin , and to which bionic hands will eventually be fitted			1
the process , called osseointegration , involves two surgeries on each limb			0
in the first , an implant is placed inside his bone which sits there for six months to allow the bone to grow around it			0
during the second stage , a bolt is fitted to the implant that protrudes through the skin			2
he is the first man to have undergone osseointegration of all four limbs and is currently six to 12 months away from having what he calls ' whizz bang bionics ' fitted to the bolts , which include bionic hands that he can operate by flexing his biceps and triceps			1
in the meantime @entity1 is building up his strength with short ' training arms ' , which he describes as ' chopsticks with weights on them , ' and short legs he calls ' stubbies '			1
@entity1 and his wife @entity23 have four children aged four to 10			1
their youngest , @entity76 , was two when his limbs were amputated and does not remember a time when he had full arms and legs @entity1 has undergone multiple surgeries to implant roads into his bone , which protrude from his skin			1
they will eventually be fitted with bionic hands @entity1 and @entity23 , both 41 , have four children – @entity86 , 10 , @entity87 , 9 , @entity88 , 8 , and @entity76 , 4 – and since being fitted with his new arms and legs he is happy to be able to do more things for and with them			1
' there are some things that are a bit easier for me to do – i can turn a page of a book , it 's a bit easier for me to help with their homework because i can kind of point to what i 'm talking about , i can kind of cuddle them a little bit but they complain that my arms are a bit cold in winter , just some simple things , which is nice , ' he told @entity110			1
' a couple of days ago i was instructing one of my sons how to tie a tie , i did it last year with my eldest son and trying to do it without pointing is very difficult , this time i could point to which bit he needed to do			0
' the prosthetics cost half a million dollars – $ 150,000 for each arm and $ 100,000 for each leg – and @entity1 requires a new set every six years			1
' because my case if very complex , i need to get the most complex prosthetics , ' he said			0
to fund the surgeries , the couple started a foundation , renovating @entity1 , and were overwhelmed with the response from the community , receiving enough donations to pay their medical costs for the next 10 years			1
' we did n't expect anything near the response we 've had			0
we 're very lucky , ' said @entity1			1
@entity1 , a former energy and resource executive , said that the overwhelming response they had from the community – which included 65 local families joining a food roster to supply them with meals after his first diagnosis – was part of what inspired him and @entity23 to write a book			1
' it was a pretty difficult decision to open up with that level of detail			0
but i think the experience we had with the community and the consistent feedback we got about how our story had helped others , we wanted to help other people , ' he said			2
' out of something disastrous or something tragic , there 's been some good that 's come out of it and if we can share that with other people , if people take something positive from it , that would be great , ' @entity23 told @entity110			2
@entity1 currently wears training arms and legs , which are training his joints to take pressure and weight , he is building up his strength so that he can be fitted with bionics @entity1 is the first person in the world to have all four of his limbs osseointegrated , a procedure that involves implanting a rod inside his bone to which bionics can be attached the couple , who met at university and have been dating since they were 17 and draw great strength from one another			1
' at the end of the day , no matter what happens , the door closes and the kids go to sleep and it 's @entity186 and i , so if that solid core was n't there , it would just be almost impossible to get through , ' said @entity1			2
' and now i 'm home a lot , if she did n't like me that 'd be a bit of a problem			0
' @entity23 says she takes her lead from @entity1 , whom she describes as more ' even - keeled ' than herself			1
' before this all happened , i do n't think i would 've said i was n't strong enough to go through this , but i would 've said @entity1 was strong enough			2
i 've been surprised at where i do have the strength , ' she said			0
' we 're a really good team , we 've been together for so long ... we 're very lucky we found each other			0
' @entity1 and @entity23 have released in the hope that sharing their story will help people and might help form a more inclusive society ultimately , @entity1 says that surviving such hardship is about the choices people make			1
' i could choose to be angry that the diagnosis was n't picked up , i could choose to be angry with @entity23 for making the decision , but really thinking about it , what choice is going to be best for me and those people that i love ? ' he said			2
' you can choose to focus on things i ca n’t do or things i can do			0
complaining about stuff is not going to be helpful either – do something about it or shut up			0
' he would like to see @entity218 be more inclusive of those around them who struggle			0
he tells the story of a man he met at the gym who told him he liked seeing him around because it made him feel better about his own life			0
' what they mean is : i feel good because your life 's bad and my life 's better than yours			0
i 'd much prefer it if people looked at that person and said : " whatever they 've gone through that was difficult , they would have learnt something quite valuable to everybody else			0
" and if they looked for that and [ we ] learnt from each other we would have a much more inclusive society			0
' hopefully by telling our story , people can understand me and our lives and [ can ] look at someone and think : that person 's got some fantastic gifts that people can learn from			0
