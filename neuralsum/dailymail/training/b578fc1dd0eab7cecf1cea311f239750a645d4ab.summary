the @entity1 @entity0 today claimed it was on the verge of an electoral earthquake after storming to second place in the @entity5 by - election			1
@entity7 held the seat vacated by former foreign secretary @entity9 , but @entity0 doubled its vote share to 24 per cent , pushing the @entity11 into third and the @entity12 slumping to a humiliating seventh just ahead of the @entity14			1
@entity0 deputy leader @entity15 said his party was knocking on the door to @entity18 and ' soon we will kick that door in '			2
in @entity5 , @entity0 secured 24 per cent of the vote as @entity7 's @entity32 held the seat with a reduced majority of 6,505			1
the result proved disastrous for the @entity12 , who came seventh and lost their deposit , and also bad for the conservatives who picked up 11.5 per cent of the vote			2
mr @entity15 said : ' it shows we are a party on an upward trajectory , that we are going places and it also shows that we are not just a southern - based party taking votes from the @entity38 , we are taking votes in the north as well			2
@entity32 ( @entity7 ) 12,493 @entity50 ( @entity0 ) 5,988 @entity51 ( @entity38 ) 2,857 @entity52 ( @entity53 ) 1,331 @entity54 ( @entity55 ) 750 lady @entity56 ( @entity57 ) 711 @entity26 ( @entity12 ) 352 @entity58 ( @entity59 ) 197 @entity60 ( @entity53 ) 57 electorate : 62,979 turnout : 24,736 ( 39.28 % ) ' we have been knocking on the door of @entity18 now for the past two years , and very soon we will kick that door in and once we get one , we 'll get two , we 'll get four and then we 'll be in there and things will change forever , ' he told the @entity68			1
the @entity5 contest was triggered by former foreign secretary @entity9 's decision to quit politics and head to the @entity73 to lead an international charity			2
@entity7 's majority was reduced from the 11,109 achieved by mr @entity9 and the 50.5 per cent share of the vote was the party 's lowest in the safe seat since 1083			1
@entity0 candidate @entity50 said : ' it 's an absolutely fantastic result for @entity0			2
' to come from nowhere to take 25 per cent at its first attempt is absolutely stunning			0
' it 's a message to all three mainstream parties that @entity0 is the official opposition			2
we have proved that in @entity7 strongholds and we have done it again in @entity5			0
' @entity9 congratulated his successor in a message on @entity92			0
he wrote : ' @entity94 and @entity7 team in @entity95			0
holding 50 % of vote very good result			0
' the @entity7 winner , a married social worker , was cheered by supporters as she became the first female mp in @entity5			0
from the podium , she said : ' i will help get people back to work , champion our wonderful town and never give the @entity109 one moment 's peace			0
' but @entity12 home office minister @entity110 said he thought the @entity7 winner 's victory speech was ' stage - managed ' and ' phoney '			1
he told @entity113 : ' i was watching the @entity7 by - election winner from @entity5 on television this morning and i have no bone to pick with her - i have never met her in my life - but it was the most stage - managed , phoney , inauthentic political display that you could ever see on television			1
" she just repeated all the same mantras about millionaires and bedrooms and i thought , does n't she have any views of her own ? ' why is n't the @entity7 letting her speak ? why is n't there any authenticity in this whole stage - managed occasion ? ' mr @entity110 said the three main parties needed to respond to the @entity0 surge by thinking ' a bit differently about how we do politics as well as the policies '			1
celebrating : labour candidate @entity32 gives a speech after winning the @entity5 by - election @entity0 is on course to win 100 council seats after local elections were held across the country @entity57 candidate @entity144 beat the @entity12 ' @entity26 , who finished seventh voters have gone to the polls in 34 council contests across @entity29 , plus the @entity149 in @entity150 , with an eligible electorate of around 40 per cent of the @entity1 total			1
a @entity0 source said ' we are expecting a cracking night ' and the party would ' triple or quadruple our vote from 2009 ' when the council seats were last contested			1
the dire result for the @entity12 is just the latest poor showing for the @entity161 's party which built its success on winning by - elections before joining the coalition			1
its one notable success was clinging on in @entity167 , but the other 13 by - elections contested since may 2010 make for grim reading : @entity170 and @entity171 : 2nd ( vote share +0.3 % ) @entity173 : 5th ( -13.1 % ) lost deposit @entity175 : 2nd ( -4.4 % ) @entity176 : 4th ( -11.1 % ) lost deposit @entity178 and @entity179 : 3rd ( -7.9 % ) @entity180 : 4th ( -7.1 % ) lost deposit @entity182 and @entity183 : 3rd ( -11.4 % ) @entity184 : 4th ( -9.5 % ) lost deposit @entity186 : 2nd ( -17.2 % ) @entity187 : 4th ( -10.5 % ) lost deposit @entity189 : 3rd ( -10 % ) @entity190 : 8th ( -13.9 % ) lost deposit @entity167 : 1st ( -14.5 % ) @entity5 : 7th ( -12.8 % ) lost deposit ) @entity194 's party became the second largest party in @entity196 as the @entity38 lost control of the authority			1
they won 16 seats in @entity196 , 10 in @entity201 , nine in @entity202 , three in @entity203 , three in @entity204 and one in @entity206			1
overnight counts took place at six authorities which were held by the @entity11 before the election			0
the conservatives retained control in @entity206 , @entity202 , @entity201 and - narrowly - @entity204 , where they lost five seats and the @entity12 lost four			1
but as well as in @entity196 , they were ousted from overall control in @entity203 , where there were four gains for @entity7 and three for @entity0			1
@entity7 's @entity219 ousted incumbent @entity109 @entity220 in the battle to be mayor of @entity223			1
results elsewhere will be announced later today			0
the father of @entity109 mp @entity226 took second place standing under the @entity0 banner in a @entity230 poll			0
@entity231 was running under that party 's description on the ballot paper at @entity235			0
he came more than 1,200 votes behind conservatives but ahead of @entity7 and @entity12			1
last night @entity109 international development secretary @entity238 said @entity0 did not have any ' substance ' and insisted the @entity109 was listening to people 's concerns			2
appearing on @entity243 's @entity242 , she said : ' i think as people take more of a look at @entity0 they will be able to form their own opinion about whether there is any substance underneath the policies			2
' i personally do n't think that there is but i think it 's up to voters to decide , obviously			0
' deputy labour leader @entity254 told the programme @entity0 's rise was a ' wake - up call ' for the establishment parties , but some of its politics were ' quite threatening '			2
she said : ' we should listen very seriously if people are feeling disaffected and disenchanted			0
it is a challenge to us			0
it 's a wake - up call for us to actually listen to people who feel that times are hard and wonder whether any of us have actually got the answers			0
' but she added : ' i do n't take the easy assumption ' oh well , it 's great because it 's going to take votes off the @entity38 '			0
' i think some of their politics is quite threatening and we should n't be complacent either			0
' @entity7 won the @entity5 by - election but the result was marked by surge in the vote for @entity0 @entity0 candidate @entity50 polled almost 6,000 votes , halving the @entity7 majority to only 5,000 @entity12 veteran @entity282 told the programme @entity0 would not ' last that long ' as a political force			1
she said : ' i may be wrong , but i think what they are doing essentially is trading on protest and they do n't have anything very solid to say about the problems that really face the country			0
' after the win , the new mp @entity32 said : ' @entity0 did make inroads but ultimately the people of @entity5 have spoken and they want a @entity7 mp			1
' her background in social work meant she had seen people living with poverty under a @entity7 government she said			0
' i have seen how people live under a @entity302 government and are really struggling , and i want to make a difference			0
