by @entity0 published : 11:56 est , 24 april 2012 updated : 10:45 est , 25 april 2012 @entity2 ’s autobiography @entity1 - a hate - filled book post-war @entity4 has fought to keep out of the bookshops - is to make a comeback in schools			2
@entity4 authorities announced today that when the copyright to the hate - filled tome expires in three years ’ time , an ‘ annotated ’ version will be made available to students across the country			1
the state of @entity15 , which became the heir to all of @entity18 ’s works , property and money following his 1945 suicide in @entity22 , said it was important for @entity4 to publish versions for children with expert analysis and comments from historians in them which refute his ideology			1
@entity1 : the hate - filled book has not been printed in @entity4 for 70 years			2
but @entity15 want to produce an annotated version before it loses ownership of its copyright in three years time while the book is not illegal in @entity4 , the state has not allowed it to be printed amid fears that it could promote @entity41			1
other countries have printed foreign - language editions since then , despite the restrictions but @entity4 have been unable to get a newly - printed version in their own language for 67 years			1
but now @entity15 has now given permission for the rest of @entity4 to freely print the book , with includes diatribes against @entity52 and @entity53 and the prophecy of a @entity4 war of conquest in the east			1
@entity1 , which translates as @entity1 or my battle , combines elements of autobiography and @entity18 's political ideology			2
it was written while the @entity64 leader was in jail following the failed 1923 @entity66 and was published in 1925			2
it includes racist diatribes against @entity52 and their ‘ twin evil ’ , communism			2
he argued that @entity4 would be forced to fight a war in the east as it secured ‘ lebensraum ’ – or living room – for its citizens at the expense of @entity53 , whom he also viewed as inferior			0
it explains why aggressively expanded @entity4 eastward , specifically the invasions of @entity80 and @entity81 , before he launched his attack against @entity84			0
as a form of manifesto , he also argued that @entity4 would be better off without parliamentary government , which he blamed for the country ’s problems			0
' the editions we plan will contain comments from experts that are clearly understandable to the young so they can clearly understand and therefore interpet the dangerous ideas within , ' announced @entity15 ’s finance minister @entity96 in @entity97			1
' we will demystify this work			0
' recently @entity15 successfully saw off attempts by a @entity101 publisher to produce extracts of @entity18 ’s book in magazine format			1
the book was once a bigger seller during the days of the @entity64 than the @entity107 and royalties from it made @entity18 incredibly wealthy			0
but since @entity41 was vanquished successive governments have always been afraid of allowing it to be re-printed because of fears that it would influence new generations of far - right radicals			0
but with the rise of the @entity116 and numerous pirated copies of the work published abroad , @entity15 believes it is better to have some control over the work when the state loses its copyright than none at all			1
in the book @entity18 pours scorn on @entity52 , outlines his plans for the racial conquest of the @entity129 and promises his followers of an empire that would last 1,000 years			0
menacing : @entity2 , seen greeting his supporters , set out many of his plans in @entity1 , which he had published in 1925 in fact it endured for just 12			0
nevertheless , the book is an integral part of the study of the @entity64 and copies have sold for up to £ 30,000 .			0

@entity15 , which owns copyright but has not allowed publication , says it 's time to print ' annotated ' version
