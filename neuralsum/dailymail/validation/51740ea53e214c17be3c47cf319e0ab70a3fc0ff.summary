the @entity0 committed today to a ' firm ' deadline of tuesday for @entity2 to make a permanent pact with a group of international negotiators not to build up it nuclear capabilities			1
' we ’ve been clear that the end of march is a firm deadline , and that ’s simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year , ' @entity0 press secretary @entity7 told reporters on friday afternoon			1
' that should be ample opportunity for us to reach an agreement			0
major powers and @entity2 were pushing each other for concessions ahead of an end - march deadline for a preliminary nuclear deal , with @entity36 demanding an immediate end to sanctions and freedom to continue sensitive atomic research , officials said @entity21 , left , @entity22 secretary of energy @entity41 , 2nd left , and others , including @entity45 , 2nd right , and @entity2 foreign minister @entity27 , right , particpate in a friday meeting at the @entity29 on friday in @entity48 , @entity49 the timetable for the details of the agreement to be set in stone continues to be the end of june			1
' but where we need to start , is the outlines of a political agreement , ' he said , which ' is something we are aiming to achieve by the end of march			0
' @entity22 officials and their foreign counterparts in the @entity64 group - the five permanent members of the @entity65 along with @entity66 - were in @entity49 on friday with @entity2 's negotiators making a desperate last ditch bid to secure a landmark agreement - 13 years since the country 's nuclear program became public			1
@entity73 's foreign secretary @entity72 said earlier this week an agreement was ' deliverable ' but urged @entity2 to make ' tough decisions ' ahead of the meeting in @entity48 , on the shores of @entity78			1
along with five world powers , @entity73 is seeking a deal that would allow @entity2 to continue its uranium enrichment program while reducing the likelihood of it gaining nuclear weapons			1
@entity2 foreign minister @entity27 told reporters staking out the talks that he did n't have a strong sense if an acceptable agreement could be made in the next several days			2
' the negotiations are difficult and complicated and there are highs and lows , ' @entity27 said , according to @entity93			0
' we think an agreement is still possible but when is another story			0
our feeling is that we certainly will be able to reach an agreement , but that will need political will on the other side			0
' the @entity0 said friday that it continued to believe the coalition had a 50 percent chance of convincing @entity2 to make the required concessions by the last day of the month , tuesday , march 31			1
' it ’s still at best 50 - 50 , ' @entity0 press secretary @entity7 said friday			1
' that ’s the odds that i have previously given to the likelihood of an agreement being reached before the deadline , and those odds have not changed			0
' @entity2 's foreign minister @entity27 , left , talks with the head of the @entity114 after friday 's meeting			1
an @entity2 official told @entity93 that lingering issues with the international coalition , which includes , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 in addition to @entity66 , @entity73 and the @entity22 , were over research and development and @entity65 sanctions still ' fluid ' next week is @entity127 's schedule			1
the @entity0 declined to give reporters a preview on friday , as is generally expected , of the president 's plans beyond a monday trip to @entity133 , @entity134 , leaving him open to take on a more direct role in negotiations			1
the president has been receiving regular and at least ' daily ' updates on the situation , his spokesman said friday			0
after the afternoon briefing the @entity0 sent reporters a notice that @entity127 had called @entity66 chancellor @entity144 to discuss the state of negotiations			1
the statement said the two world leaders agreed that ' @entity2 must make decisions necessary to resolve several remaining issues			2
' it did not provide details on what those deal - breaking matters were			0
an @entity2 official told @entity93 , however , that lingering issues with the coalition , which includes , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 in addition to @entity66 , @entity73 and the @entity22 , were over research and development and @entity65 sanctions			1
@entity2 reportedly wants an immediate draw down of sanctions , which the @entity22 and its partners have said is a deal - breaker			1
the @entity0 reiterated on friday that only after it verified , over time , that @entity2 was keeping up its end of the pact would it ask @entity168 to ease sanctions on the country			1
another @entity2 negotiator told @entity172 on friday that as far as his country is concerned , ' it all depends on the willingness of the other side			2
all the solutions are on the table			0
' ' we have already done what we need to do , ' he stated			0
@entity2 president @entity181 reached out directly to the leaders of @entity121 , @entity120 , @entity73 and @entity119 on thursday in an attempt to break the stalemate and passed on letters to all six members of the international coalition , including president @entity127			1
elsewhere , the hawkish @entity121 foreign minister @entity188 has warned against a soft deal during negotiations			2
' tough decisions ' : this map helps demonstrate how @entity2 's nuclear program is spread across the country @entity73 's @entity72 warned failure to achieve a deal over @entity2 's nuclear program could trigger a nuclear arms race in the @entity198			1
@entity2 's nuclear program became public in 2002 when an opposition group revealed secret activity including construction of an uranium enrichment plant and a heavy - water reactor			2
enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons , while spent fuel from a heavy - water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a bomb			1
following that , @entity2 agreed to inspections by the @entity213 ( @entity213 )			0
but the @entity213 could not confirm whether it had tried to develop nuclear weapons			1
this led the @entity64 to press @entity2 to stop enriching uranium			0
talks failed and in 2005 the @entity213 referred @entity2 to the @entity65 for failing to comply with the @entity218 ( @entity218 )			2
since then , the @entity65 has adopted six resolutions requiring @entity2 to stop enriching uranium , some imposing sanctions			0
in 2012 , the @entity22 and @entity222 began imposing additional sanctions on @entity2 oil exports and banks , putting pressure on @entity2 to negotiate			2
@entity36 insists its program is for civil nuclear power , but the international community has imposed sanctions amid concerns @entity2 harbors ambitions to create nuclear weapons			1
in a speech in @entity235 , @entity72 said he was clear that ' no deal is better than a bad deal ' if talks in @entity49 break down this weekend			2
' but we should also be clear - eyed about the alternative , ' he said			0
' no deal means no restrictions on enrichment , no restrictions on research and development , and no independent monitoring or verification			0
it means a fundamentally more unstable @entity198 , with the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the region			0
' he added : ' so now is the time , with our key allies , to build on the recent momentum , to press @entity2 where differences remain , and to strain every sinew to get a deal over the finishing line			2
the door to a nuclear deal is open , but @entity2 must now step through it			2
' @entity2 and the @entity64 agreed an interim accord in november 2013 that saw it cut down on sensitive nuclear activities in return for temporary relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy			0
a deadline of july 2014 was set to find a ' comprehensive solution ' , but the talks were subsequently extended by four months to give negotiators more time			0
despite ' significant progress ' being made , both sides agreed in november that another seven months were needed			0
diplomats now hope to reach a rough deal this weekend with all - important technical details decided by june 30 .			0

' we ’ve been clear that the end of march is a firm deadline , and that ’s simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year , ' @entity0 spokesman said friday
@entity22 , along with @entity73 , @entity120 , @entity119 , @entity66 and @entity121 trying to thrash out the *framework* for a deal by tuesday , march 31
talks are aimed at reducing the ability of @entity2 to develop nuclear weapons
@entity0 still believes the coalition has a 50 percent chance of convincing @entity2 to make the required concessions by the deadline
details of the deal would be hashed out over the *summer* before july 1
