veteran @entity1 commentator @entity0 has said that the corporation should have tried harder to win the rights to the @entity4 and that attempts to give women equal rights in golf have ' caused mayhem '			1
recent legislation has given women more rights in golf clubs , while @entity15 and @entity16 's have both voted to admit female members for the first time			1
but @entity0 told the @entity20 magazine that equality for women had ' b * * * * * * * up the game for a lot of people '			1
veteran broadcaster @entity0 ( second right ) claimed gender equality laws have ‘ b * * * * * ed up the game ’ the commentator also claimed the @entity1 should have done more to secure the @entity4 coverage ' there 's been a hell of a row because four golf courses that hold the @entity4 did n't have women members , ' he said			1
' i 'm told the @entity37 has lost 150,000 members since equality for women came in			1
hundreds of women have left golf clubs because they 've gone from paying half fare to full fare			2
' all of the wives of members at these clubs could have used the facilities for free			1
when i was at @entity50 a couple of years ago talking to a few of the lady members , i said , " what about this equality ? you must be happy about that ? " " @entity58 no , " they said			1
" we can come here and do what we like , we can play golf and do n't pay anything "			2
' he added : ' the equality thing is a great part of golf			2
equality for women : a few people battled away to get it , they got it , and they have b * * * * * * * up the game for a lot of people			2
' @entity0 ' comments come as the 2016 @entity4 will be the last to be broadcast live on the @entity1 before @entity79 takes over			1
the former professional golfer , 84 , told the magazine : ' i very much regret that the @entity1 has lost the @entity4 , but i said it might do 10 years ago			1
' he admitted that the @entity1 could not compete with @entity79 's deep pockets but added : ' i do n't think there were enough people at the @entity1 dealing with the negotiations who cared enough			1
' i can think of a couple of heads of sport from years ago who would have battled harder			2
but , having said that , when people get used to it i think the highlights will be wonderfully supported			2
' @entity0 defended his style from critics , saying : ' i think they just do n't like my delivery			1
they either think i waffle on , or do n't know enough about the young players coming up			0
' " you 're living in the past ! you 're one of the old colonel blimp school : must wear a tie to go and have a pee in the clubhouse			0
" that sort of thing			0
' i think i 've moved very well with the times			0
but there are certain standards in golf that have been there forever			0
' the broadcaster insisted he could not work for @entity79 he said that he could not imagine working for @entity79			2
' they never asked me			0
i was a @entity1 man through - and - through and they paid me well enough , ' he said			1
' i think @entity79 is magnificent and if you like golf it 's amazing , but they do it differently			0
if i went to @entity79 the best i could do is sit in the studio or have a pre-tournament ramble about the players			0
' @entity0 added : ' i was watching golf from @entity126 a couple of weeks ago			1
it is a masterpiece , one of the modern @entity129			0
and in the middle of the desert they have created a golfing oasis			0
' not once in over four hours did the commentator say , ' what an amazing place this is '			2
you hoped the camera would pan round , lift up from the course			0
i would have said something daft like , ' if you 've got very good eyesight , you might just see @entity143 over that hill '			0
' he said that he had ' thought about leaving ' the @entity1			1
' i 've got problems getting about but the brain is still sharp enough , ' he added			0
' when i do n't think it 's sharp enough , i shall say i 'm off			0
the @entity1 keep saying to me , ' stay as long as you like			1
' ' it 's lovely nonsense			0
what if i live to be 105 ? they 'll only keep me as long as i 'm all right , and i 'll only stay as long as i 'm all right , ' he said .			0
