by @entity0 terrorists are changing tactics to slip under the radar after being given ‘ full sight ’ of @entity6 tradecraft by whistleblower @entity7 , a counter-terrorism director warned today			1
@entity9 , one of the government ’s most senior counter terrorism officials , said the surveillance leaks published in the @entity14 newspaper had led to a ‘ substantial reduction ’ in intelligence on suspects as they have changed their methods of communication			1
the director at the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) said the release of information from the @entity7 documents had given extremists ‘ full sight ’ of tools and techniques used by the @entity30 listening station @entity6 , which had had a ‘ severe ’ effect on spying operations			1
listening post : @entity6 's headquarters in @entity35 he told a counter terrorism conference : ‘ the leaks we have all seen in the press have made the work of the @entity21 , the intelligence agencies and the apparatus of the government much , much , much more difficult			1
‘ our adversaries , the terrorists , what they now have is full sight of the sorts of tools and the range of techniques that are being used by @entity44 and i can tell you the data shows a substantial reduction in the use of those methods of communication as a result of the @entity7 leaks			1
‘ that makes it much more difficult to track the activity and the illegal activity of terrorists			0
‘ so the @entity7 effect has been a very , very severe one			2
’ whistleblower : @entity7 was a contract employee at the @entity69 attack : mr @entity9 described @entity7 's leaks as ' very damaging ' he went on to say the swathe of sensitive information leaked by @entity7 , who stole tens of thousands of confidential and top secret files , had seriously damaged national security			1
‘ basically you see people using less of the methods that he ( @entity7 ) described the government uses to track terrorism and as a natural consequence terrorists are trying to use other methods			2
we have to be more agile , ’ he said			0
‘ there is no doubt it has been very damaging			0
‘ when you start revealing what the government does to stop terrorism then you are going to get terrorists using other methods to try to get around it			0
’ @entity7 , a former @entity95 @entity69 it contractor , caused uproar last june when he disclosed details of the extent of surveillance and electronic intelligence gathering by his former employers and @entity6 to the @entity14 and @entity102			1

but earlier this month a watchdog rubbished @entity7 ’s claims of ‘ mass intrusion ’ by @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity6 into the private lives of millions of innocent citizens			1
the interception of communications commissioner sir @entity130 said they were not breaking the law , nor were they using @entity95 intercept material to snoop on @entity30			0
mr @entity9 is the latest senior figure to blast the leaks , which have been described within @entity135 as effectively a ‘ guidebook for terrorists ’			1
