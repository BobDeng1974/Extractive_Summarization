by @entity0 last updated at 2:15 am on 20th january 2012 police fighting to stop @entity3 migrants binge drinking in the street have put up posters in seven different languages saying that alcohol is banned			1
officers in @entity9 , @entity10 , had the message translated into @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
it is also written in @entity19			1
the area is home to a growing number of people from @entity3 countries who are drinking cans and bottles of alcohol in public			2
alcohol ban : officers were forced to translate signs into seven different languages in this street in @entity9 , @entity10 @entity33 have spent £ 3.3million over the last three years on translators			1
they have even deployed a @entity14 - speaking officer to the area so they can communicate effectively with the growing number of migrants			2
inspector @entity41 , senior neighbourhood officer for @entity9 , said that reports of street drinking in the area had been ' on the increase due to @entity3 coming and not fully understanding the regulations			2
' he added : ' while those involved in street drinking in the area are not confined to any one specific community , we are aware that a proportion of those involved are from @entity3 countries			2
booze ban : a sign like the one which is already up in the street in @entity9 , @entity10 ' we need people to understand the restrictions without language being a barrier			0
' the leaflets and posters will mean that when officers encounter people from these communities who are in breach of the order they wo n’t be able to claim ignorance of the law as an excuse			0
' off - licence worker @entity75 , from @entity76 , said the multi-lingual measures were a ' good idea ' but agreed the street drinking problem - one he regularly experiences - was a cross-nationality one			0
police said they had to put up the sign in several different languages because migrants simply did not understand that they were breaking the law			0
they brought in the signs so people can not plead for leniency claiming they could not read the @entity19 signs			0
the signs have been placed in the front of shops and pubs along the street which runs through the centre of @entity9 on the outskirts of @entity98			0
anyone caught drinking in the street faces being fined £ 500			1
although the ban was brought in two years ago the rules have been repeatedly flouted			1
drinks forbidden : the sign has been printed in @entity19 and six other eastern @entity3 languages			0

@entity33 have spent £ 3.3million on translation costs over the last three years
