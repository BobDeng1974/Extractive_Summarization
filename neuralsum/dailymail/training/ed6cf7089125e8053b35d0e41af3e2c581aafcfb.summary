@entity1 manager @entity0 has taken a double swipe at @entity3 - 29 days before the start of the season			1
the @entity6 , speaking at his unveiling as a @entity9 ambassador , claimed summer signing @entity10 never wanted to return to the @entity11 this summer and said @entity12 has set a poor example to children after he was caught smoking in @entity16 last week			1
@entity0 pulled off a coup by signing @entity10 from @entity18 earlier this summer , despite the fact @entity3 had first option on the midfielder			1
@entity10 had indicated @entity3 snubbed the chance to re-sign , but @entity0 claims the midfielder never intended to go back to north @entity35 and says it it took him just 20 minutes to clinch his signing			1
' how did i persuade him ? i spoke to him for about 20 minute , ' said @entity0			1
' i think he really wanted to come			2
@entity3 had an option where they could interfere , but i do n't ' think he was open to that			2
he was in our direction so it was easy for me			2
' and the @entity45 had his say on the smoking controversy that has engulfed @entity12 this week			1
the @entity31 midfielder was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a holiday in @entity16			1
easy decision : the @entity1 boss claimed it took just 20 minutes to convince @entity10 to join it was the second time in nine months @entity12 has been snapped with a cigarette in his mouth , despite his protestations that he is not a smoker			1
and @entity0 says the @entity59 midfielder is not fulfillng his status as a role model after his @entity16 escapade			1
' what football players do , millions and millions are watching , lots of kids are watching , ' said the @entity68 boss			1
' i ’m not a specialist , obviously , but i do n’t think if a football player smokes one cigar or cigarette with friends in the summer when he is not training – i do n’t think it affects his performance			2
' what gets affected is that a kid at home says if a top football player can smoke then i can smoke and it is not a problem			2
bad example : @entity0 also blasted @entity12 who was photographed smoking this week got his man : @entity0 claims the signing of @entity88 represents a ' fantastic job ' for his club ' it is more a social consequence than a physical consequence			1
' would i be angry if it was my player ? being angry is not a solution but i would just explain exactly that , that everything they do or wear is part of the kids ’ life			2
' if they smoke , maybe the kids think they do it a lot of times and they will probably do the same			2
' meanwhile , @entity0 insists @entity1 have finished their summer spending after completing their £ 16million move for @entity109			1
the deal for @entity113 left - back @entity88 was rubber stamped yesterday , adding to the captures of @entity10 and @entity115			0
@entity0 said : ' i have to say my club did a fantastic job , not just because of what we bought , but that we did it in almost in record time			1
final piece : @entity88 is the last signing @entity1 will make this summer according to their boss ' we have closed our market today			1
we knew the targets the club attacked them at an early stage			0
i do n't think we will sign anyone else , we are happy with what i have			0
' i 'm square about the other teams , i 'm just so happy with my squad and confident with what i have in my hands			0
' the @entity68 boss is still awaiting the return of his heartbroken @entity138 internationals following their humiliating @entity140 exit to @entity141			2
@entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 were part of @entity147 's squad that slumped to that embarrassing 7 - 1 loss to the eventual world champions			2
ready again : @entity144 ( front right ) , @entity143 ( front , second right ) , and @entity142 ( front left ) will all come back stronger after @entity138 's disappointing @entity140 defeat to @entity141 according to @entity0 but @entity0 does not fear for his @entity156 stars , and has revealed he felt some of his @entity159 's had one eye on the @entity140 during the closing stages of last season			1
' i was more worried last season			0
last season i felt them too much connected with the @entity140 and we were january february and march and i was feeling them already there and that really worried me , it as a difficult situation			0
' now it was a big disappointment but you have to move on from that in football			0
i ’m waiting for them and i do n’t think it will be a problem			0
i have to try to use it in a positive way – you did n’t succeed so this season is important for you , lets change the image and the feelings and go back to what you are as what you were in the @entity140 was your twin brother			0
' trio : @entity142 was one of three @entity1 players for @entity138 at the @entity140 fresh start : @entity0 does n't believe the @entity140 will haunt his players moving on : @entity0 wants @entity144 , @entity143 and @entity142 to leave their international disappointment behind @entity0 is also expecting this year 's @entity191 title race to be as competitive as ever			1
he said : ' last year , if you had asked me in july , i would never have said @entity194 would be outside the top four			0
this season i will tell you one ( to miss out ) and i have a big percentage of making a mistake			0
' there were good teams last season and there will be better teams this season because everyone is investing			0
a few years ago you make a team to be champions and most probably you are champions			0
now if you make a team to be champions , you try to finish in the top four			0
' why i like the @entity191 so much is that at this moment , nobody knows who is going to win the title			0
i know that we want to and i know that we can , but it is the kind of competition where i ca n't say			0
at this moment , i think between us , @entity216 , @entity3 , @entity194 , @entity217 - who is going to be first , who is going to play in the @entity220 , i do n't know			0

@entity1 boss claims it took 20 minutes to convince former @entity31 captain to choose @entity1
@entity12 's smoking sends the *wrong* *message* to children
@entity0 also claims his summer spending is over
