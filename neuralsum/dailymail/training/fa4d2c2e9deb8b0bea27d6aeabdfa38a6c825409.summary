the @entity2 / @entity1 love - in made me sick @entity4 oozes passion for @entity6 should give him a go in a short space of time , @entity8 have gone from having one of the best strikers in their history scoring their goals , to having potentially one of the worst strikers in their history not scoring goals			1
what should the @entity19 do with @entity21 ? after the @entity25 game , the attention given to the half - time shirt swap masked another fairly lame and tame performance from @entity27			2
it ’s not the greatest crime , to swap shirts , but it was poor judgment from the @entity33			0
@entity44 listened to all the criticism from @entity47 players and managers who said that @entity21 should be dropped , or that they believe he wo n’t be at the club next season			0
@entity44 then had no choice but to pick his marquee summer signing			0
had he dropped him , it would have appeared that he was bowing down to the critics			0
@entity27 showed signs of life against @entity41 , but it was far from what could be described as a special performance			2
so what should @entity44 do to get more from his man ? or better still , maybe we should ask what can @entity27 do to put things right ? @entity44 took a gamble by buying @entity27 for £ 16million in the summer his lack of pressing and his limited energy are all too noticeable			1
he is the very antithesis of dynamic			0
@entity44 could sit him down and show him what @entity72 did last season of course , but then that would simply make @entity27 realise just how inferior he is to the @entity77 – it could leave his confidence permanently shot , and undermine the relationship between player and manager			2
better still , show him what @entity83 is doing at @entity85			1
i was at the @entity87 at the weekend and not for the first time this season he was the stand - out player on the pitch			0
@entity83 streaks clear of @entity90 to score @entity85 's opening goal against @entity92 on saturday his quality is obvious – that ’s why signing him was a no - brainer – we all watched the @entity97 , we ’d all seen him for @entity98 and for @entity99 before that			1
what has impressed me more is that he does n’t wait for things to happen , he makes them happen			0
he chases lost causes , he causes problems for defenders , his work - rate is astonishing			0
and so after almost half an hour on saturday , @entity83 ’s refusal to just stand off @entity90 and let him control the ball in his own half , then pass the ball unchallenged was rewarded with a mistake from the experienced @entity92 defender , and a clear run on goal for the @entity85 man			1
that ’s the kind of pressing @entity27 needs to learn			1
@entity83 celebrates with @entity118 after scoring his first goal on saturday and @entity83 kept it up right through to injury time when he grabbed his second			2
and this is the one that @entity27 really needs to learn from			1
in the 92nd minute @entity83 surged towards the @entity92 box			2
his wayward pass gifted possession to @entity92 , but @entity83 did n’t give up , he chased , forced @entity127 into a dreadful error , and picked up a second goal as a result			0
@entity21 needs to be full of running for the whole match – just like @entity83			0
@entity21 needs to respond better when things go wrong – chase the ball if a pass goes wrong , do n’t turn away or throw your arms in the air			0
@entity27 is yet to score in the @entity138 for @entity8 since joining from @entity139 in the summer he needs to be dynamic – just like @entity83 is			1
the reality for @entity85 is that @entity83 has saved their season so far – he ’s been brilliant , so credit to @entity143 for making the signing happen			1
if @entity27 takes time out to sit down and watch what @entity85 ’s new man is doing , he might work out how to make good things happen for him at @entity8 , and how to prove his critics wrong .			1

@entity27 still not scored in the @entity138 for @entity8
@entity8 striker has been criticised much of late for his poor form
@entity83 has been a *revelation* at @entity85 since joining in summer
@entity27 could learn from @entity83 's pressing and dynamism
