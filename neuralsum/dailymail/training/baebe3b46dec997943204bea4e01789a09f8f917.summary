or help with college tuition			2
and the rest have business propositions , ’ he laughed			2
‘ like that should be my legacy : to lose money on your movie or your moisturizer line			2

in november @entity8 was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer after a year of inconclusive tests and mysterious discomfort			1
having defied that diagnosis ’ original death sentence - he was given three to six months to live - @entity8 continues to push ahead with no whiff of ‘ why me ? ’ ‘ instead , i think , “ this is a really bad situation - and what else can i do to get out of it ? ’ ” wealthy : @entity8 had a falling out with his co-creator @entity26 ( pictured ) and left the show in 1993 but retained a healthy stake in the franchise the 58 - year - old fervent philanthropist is spending his final months funding projects that feed homeless people and save animals from being killed in animal shelters			1
‘ i ’m supporting the charities that i supported during my lifetime , ’ he states , ‘ and i want to continue to do that			2
’ @entity8 grew up comfortably in @entity52 , where his father was in the garment industry , not showbiz			1
after turning his drawing talent into a job at an animation studio that made cartoons for kids , @entity8 submitted a script , on spec , to the @entity64 comedy ‘ taxi			1
’ his script was bought and produced , and @entity8 , in his 20s , was hired as a staff writer and soon rose to be the showrunner			1
from there he joined a new @entity72 sitcom called ‘ cheers , ’ where he was staff writer for its ascendant first three seasons			2
in 1987 he became a writer and executive producer on the @entity79 comedy series ‘ the @entity80 , ’ teamed alongside @entity81 , the comedy legend with whom he had worked on ‘ @entity84 ’ and ‘ taxi , ’ and , of course , cartoonist @entity26			2
they became the founding fathers of ‘ @entity1			1

@entity8 was named creative supervisor , and he hired the first writing staff as well as creating several @entity99 citizens , including mr. @entity100 , the cadaverous industrialist , and @entity102 , the buffoonish physician			1
although @entity8 remained the least - known of the three creators , by many accounts he was the most hands - on			1

‘ no one 's smarter than he is			0

‘ with “ @entity1 , ” people did n't know what they were gon na see , ’ says @entity8			1
‘ they did n't have a clue			0
’ the show was given time and free reign to flourish by the fledgling @entity79			0

but it was a lucrative departure			0
his exit deal entitled him to royalties from ‘ @entity1 ’ that , as it enters its 25th season this fall , annually pad @entity8 's wallet by tens of millions of dollars			1
he has played no role on the show in nearly 20 years ( not even watching it , he says ) , even as his name remains in the weekly credits along with @entity26 's and @entity81 ' - and his checks roll in			0
this sweet annuity has bankrolled the causes and alternative lifestyle he increasingly came to embrace			0
among his charitable efforts , he established the @entity151 , which rescues dogs from animal shelters and trains them to assist disabled veterans and the hard - of - hearing			1
he donated an undisclosed amount of money to the @entity158 in 2012 to purchase a vessel for their fleet , which was unveiled last december and named for him			0
in march , @entity163 , @entity164 , headquarters were christened the @entity165 in recognition of his support for that organization			0
animal lover : much of his time and attention has been dedicated to the well being of animals , and he runs a home for dogs ( pictured are his two dogs @entity176 and @entity178 ) @entity8 's largesse carries over to humans , too , including a @entity182 food bank feeding 200 families each day in @entity8 style : with a vegan menu			1
meanwhile , he keeps his hand in the comedy world , consulting a half - day each week on the @entity189 comedy ‘ @entity190			0
’ ‘ probably the highlight of my week , ’ he says			0
‘ that and my radio show , ’ which he hosts from his home on the online @entity197 site – ‘ one 's on tuesdays , one 's on fridays			0
’ if he sees this as a closeted and tentative existence , @entity8 does n't let on			2
a man who boxed for several years as a serious amateur , he now finds amusement in his inability to even handle a car			0
‘ recently i drove home from @entity210 in @entity211 , probably a four - minute drive , ’ he reports with a get - a - load - of - this grin , ‘ and i got into three accidents on the way home : i hit a stanchion , a tree and another car			0
but afterward i thought , “ maybe driving 's not a good idea			0
' " as with everybody else , time is running out for @entity8 , who has learned to make no long - term plans , including recognizing any prospective end date			2
he says death does n't scare him , however unpleasant getting there may be			0
