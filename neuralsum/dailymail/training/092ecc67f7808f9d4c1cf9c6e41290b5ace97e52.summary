@entity110 : @entity17 , pictured , claims the university 's blind use of @entity110 as a yard stick for a healthy weight is where they are going wrong ' it subjects students who have a personal and family history of low weight to treatment that harms our mental health , ' she writes in the article			1
' by forcing standards upon us that we can not meet , the @entity128 plays the same role as fashion magazines and swimsuit calendars that teach us about the " correct shape " of the human body			0
