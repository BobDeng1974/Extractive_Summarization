by @entity0 @entity3 's house price boom is gathering pace with some areas seeing the cost of a home rise by almost a quarter in 2013 , @entity1 can reveal today			1
in the past 12 months buyers have been scrambling to buy properties , particularly in @entity10 and the south - east , because there has been an ' insufficient rise ' in new homes , driving up the cost of a flat or house by more than £ 1million in some cases			1
on average , house prices in the @entity3 were up seven per cent this year , adding around £ 14,000 to the average property , which now costs £ 171,000			1
this will go up another eight per cent by the end of 2014 and up to 30 per cent by 2013 , experts say			1
a new interactive map produced by experts from @entity24 , exclusively for @entity1 , also reveals that house prices in prime spots are now almost double what they were at the start of the 2008 crash			1

in @entity10 the increases have been highest , with @entity35 and @entity36 , known as ' nappy valley ' , up around 23 per cent in the past 12 months			2
average houses in prime areas like these are close to the £ 2million barrier for the first time			2
areas outside the capital , like @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , have seen the biggest rises , with the cost of a home now between nine per cent and 15 per cent higher than a year ago			2
but experts insisted today that there no ' bubble '			0
@entity55 , @entity24 @entity3 head of residential research , said : ' the simple mechanics of supply and demand have driven this price growth			0
' @entity62 numbers of affluent families have remained in @entity10 , putting pressure on a limited pool of housing stock in certain areas			2
' those priced out are looking to emerging prime markets , while other have begun to re-look at the prime suburbs and commuter towns			0
' but there have been some losers this year , with prices down almost entirely across the board in @entity76 in 2013 , with little or no growth in @entity78 , the @entity79 and the @entity80			1
big rise : @entity36 and @entity35 had the biggest price increases in the past year , up around 23 per cent , which will add huge sums to many properties picture of @entity3 : house prices in some areas have now risen beyond the 2008 peak , before the crash , and are expected to go up across the board in the next five years trends : @entity24 predicts that next year there will be a rise in prime properties , followed by a lull in 2015 , before more sustained growth on homes worth in excess of £ 800,000 today the house price boom is predicted to last for another five years meaning the average cost of a home will jump by £ 43,000			1
buoyant : @entity102 prices will rise by up to eight per cent next year to build on strong gains this year , according to a forecast from @entity105 prices in some areas will rocket by a third by 2018 , according to @entity24 , fuelling a growing gap between homeowners and those who can not afford to buy			1
the property seller forecasts the average cost of a home would rise by 25 per cent in the next five years – from £ 171,000 to £ 214,000			1
the news has coincided with annual figures released by the @entity105			0
it said further economic recovery and continued low interest rates would support a broadly similar increase to this year , which has already seen prices go up seven per cent in the first 11 months of this year			2
but a price surge in @entity10 , which has seen the steepest rises , is expected to slow down , the bank added			0
the forecast comes in the wake of a warning from business secretary @entity127 that the government might need to review its flagship help to buy programme amid what he called a ' raging housing boom ' in the capital and the @entity135			0
@entity105 ’s housing economist , @entity136 said : ' the housing market has been stronger than expected during 2013			0
higher demand , combined with an insufficient rise in housing supply , has resulted in increases in house prices and higher activity this year			1
low interest rates , and higher consumer confidence due to the increasing evidence that a sustainable economic recovery may now be underway , are helping to stimulate housing demand			0
schemes , such as @entity150 , also appear to have boosted demand			0
' nationally , house prices have increased by seven per cent in the first 11 months of the year			1
activity has also picked up with transactions likely to exceed one million for the first time since 2007 ' .			0

lack of new homes has led to buyers scrambling to buy property , pushing up prices by £ 14,000 on average this year
despite *deepest* *recession* in *history* a flat or house in some areas is now double what it was in 2008
winners are @entity10 , south - east and @entity171 , but @entity76 , the @entity80 and @entity79 suffer *decline* or *stagnation*
experts believe prices will rise by eight per cent next year and by up to 30 per cent by 2018
