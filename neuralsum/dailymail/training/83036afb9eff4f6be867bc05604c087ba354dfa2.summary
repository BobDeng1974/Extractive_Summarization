by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:52 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 04:42 est , 7 february 2014 rows about money during the recession triggered a rise in divorces , new figures suggested today			1
money worries , the threat of redundancy and cutting back on life ’s luxuries lead to more relationships breaking up			1
divorce rates had been falling in the years since 2004 , but as the economy emerged from recession in 2009 there was a surge in couples heading to the courts			1
in 2010 the number of marital break - ups rose by 4.9 per cent , before levelling off			2
in 2011 , 117,558 couples decided to go their separate ways and this rose to 118,140 in 2012			2
the @entity28 today linked the rise to fall - out of the 2008 - 09 recession			1
‘ one theory suggests that recession could contribute to a rise in partnership break - ups because of increased financial strain , changes in employment and related lifestyle changes , ’ the @entity28 said			1
‘ social research in @entity40 has shown that unemployment and downturns in the housing market may be associated with family instability			0
’ there were 13 divorces an hour in @entity47 and @entity48 in 2012 almost half of these divorces occurred in the first 10 years of marriage			1
the statistics also show a rise in double - divorcees			2
in 1980 just one in ten men and women who divorced also had their previous marriage end in divorce			1
this figure rose to almost one in five by 2012 , the @entity28 said			0
some people may also choose to divorce during an economic downturn because they think they will get a more favourable divorce settlement if their income is currently low			0
there is a conflicting theory that an ‘ unfavourable economic climate ’ can lead to an increase in family solidarity during difficult times , with people postponing marital break - ups until the economy , and the value of their home improves			0
the @entity28 suggested that ‘ recession is associated with an increased risk of divorce , but with a delayed impact ’			2
‘ this perhaps reflects a couple ’s wait for an economic recovery to lift the value of their assets or the time lag between separation and obtaining a decree absolute			0
’ a similar trend was seen after the 1990 - 92 recession , when divorce rates increased more markedly in 1993 than during the recession itself			1
estimates suggest that 42 per cent of marriages end in divorce , the report states			1
the @entity28 said a third of marriages are expected to end in divorce before the couple reach their 20th wedding anniversary			1
and the average marriage is expected to last for 32 years			2
in 2012 , the median length of time that couples stayed married before officially separating was 11 and a half years			1
family justice minister @entity106 said : ' mediation works			0
we are committed to making sure that more people make use of it rather than go through the confrontational and stressful experience of going to court			0
' these figures show thousands of people are sadly still divorcing each year			0
we want them to do it in the least damaging way for everyone involved , especially children			0
' that is why we want them to use the excellent mediation services available to agree a way forward , rather than have one forced upon them			0
' in 2012 divorce rates among men aged over 50 and women over 45 were higher than a decade earlier			1
the average age of men getting a divorce is now 44.7 years and for women 42.2 years			1
in 2012 , 9,703 men and 6,026 women aged over 60 got divorced			1
the @entity28 said : ' the mean age at divorce generally declined for both males and females during the mid to late 1970s and generally remained stable in the early 1980s			0
' since 1985 the mean ages at divorce for men and women have increased , rising by 7.3 years for both men and women			1
' this trend is consistent with increases in the mean age at marriage			0
' the difference between the mean age of husband and wife at divorce has remained relatively unchanged over the last four decades , with a difference of around 2.5 years except for the years 1974 to 1976 when it was 2.0 years			2
' @entity153 , the senior partner at @entity154 , said : ‘ i believe the economic situation , with the @entity40 falling in and out of recession , has played a key role : a greater number of businesses go into liquidation when a country emerges from recession , and in my experience this principle applies to marriages too			0
‘ couples will struggle through times of adversity as best they can , but eventually find that despite their best efforts , they simply ca n't go on any longer			0
’ almost 16,000 marriages ended in 2012 because of adultery			0
in 2012 , the mean age of a divorcee was 44.7 for men and 42.2 for women			2
the @entity28 said that the mean age for divorce has been steadily rising since the mid- 1980s , coinciding with a rise in the age at which people wed. provisional marriage statistics suggest that in 2011 the average age for men to marry was 36.3 and 33.8 for women			1
@entity184 , partner at law firm @entity185 , added : ' the fact that there has been a slight increase could be attributed to couples believing that they can finally afford to divorce now the recession appears to be coming an end			1
' commonly , they feel that in a healthier economy , they may be more likely to find jobs and financial security to sustain them after they separate			0
' @entity197 , chief executive of relationship charity @entity198 , said : ' we are saddened by the news that the number of divorces has risen slightly in 2012 , especially as they had been in decline for the past few years			2
' what matters to us is the quality of a relationship , rather than status			0
ultimately , people 's happiness and wellbeing is of paramount importance and strong couple relationships are proven to be an important part of that			0

there were 13 divorces an hour in @entity47 and @entity48 in 2012
