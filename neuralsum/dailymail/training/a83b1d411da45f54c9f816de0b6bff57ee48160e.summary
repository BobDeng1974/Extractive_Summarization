@entity1 may have access to @entity4 top secret intelligence and battle plans , the @entity0 announced on @entity6 on friday			1
@entity7 warned @entity4 officials that they should prepare for the worst case scenario following the @entity11 leak detailing the ins and outs of the @entity4 surveillance network			2
former @entity16 contractor @entity11 is seeking asylum in @entity18 after following his information leak to @entity20 last year and the @entity4 intelligence committee can only assume that @entity1 already has some information from @entity11 or that they are trying to obtain it			1
defense intelligence agency director lieutenant general @entity25 warns of the likely possibility @entity11 leaked important information about @entity4 security to @entity1 ' if i 'm concerned about anything , i 'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked , and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries â€” in this case , of course , @entity1 , ' @entity7 said			1
@entity7 is worried about what else @entity11 may know because he may have information about technology and weapons systems , operational capabilities , and intelligence capabilities , reports @entity45			2
re-vamping the @entity4 surveillance network and changing military tactics is essential to national security but will be an arduous process			2
' we really do n't know ' what @entity11 's got , @entity7 said			0
' we have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised , ' he warned			0
he said that if @entity1 had @entity4 intelligence , which they very well may , that it 's very ' serious			1
' according to @entity7 and and the director of @entity4 intelligence @entity61 , @entity11 's leaks have already posed a threat to @entity64			1
former contract employee at the @entity16 , @entity11 , is currently seeking asylum in @entity1 the leak has caused the @entity4 to lose critical information sources			1
' what @entity11 has stolen and exposed has gone way , way beyond his professed concerns with so - called domestic surveillance programs , ' @entity61 said back in january			0
' as a result , we 've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources , including some shared with us by valued partners			0
' terrorists who make it a priority to familiarize themselves with @entity4 intelligence agencies will be more prepared than ever to go under the radar			1
' @entity11 claims that he 's won and that his mission is accomplished , ' @entity61 added			0
' if that is so , i call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to @entity4 security			2
' @entity7 chimed in and said , ' the greatest cost that is unknown today but that we will likely face is the cost of human lives on tomorrow 's battlefield or in some place where we will put our military forces when we ask them to go into harm 's way			0
