however , despite attracting more adults , the @entity123 still has 37,867 young people on waiting lists who are unable join up because even more adult volunteers are needed			0
@entity38 , chief scout , said : ' it ’s great that so many adults are joining the @entity10 , and i am sure the increase has had much to do with the @entity7 becoming a @entity92 volunteer last year			1

reaching @entity92 is a remarkable achievement and along the way they will have all had the adventure of a lifetime			0
' as one of the @entity64 ’s most high profile figures , it ’s hoped the @entity3 ’ involvement will inspire other adults to get involved in scouting			0

' i did my training with the @entity3 in @entity191 last month and had a great day with her			0
if someone as busy as the @entity3 can find time to volunteer , anyone can ! i could n’t recommend volunteering more highly ; i just wish i ’d got involved sooner			2
