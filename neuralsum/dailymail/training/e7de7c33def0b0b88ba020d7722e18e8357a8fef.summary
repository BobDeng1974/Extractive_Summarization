after the @entity0 comes @entity2 ’s new @entity1			1
disowned by the paying public at @entity4 on wednesday night and increasingly unwanted by the biggest clubs in the transfer market			1
almost 40,000 are expected at @entity4 , itself something of a triumph for the marketing department considering @entity2 ’s uninspiring performances in @entity11			1
@entity12 claimed ticket sales may have been hit by the start of the school year but , in fairness , this seemed unlikely			2
tough job : @entity12 must try to excite the @entity20 public again against @entity21 on wednesday night lack of interest : around 40,000 fans , less than half the capacity , are expected to be in attendance tough to watch : @entity2 were knocked out of the @entity26 without winning a game in @entity11 it ’s hard to imagine the armchair audience voting in their millions by snubbing @entity31 for a friendly against @entity21 , in preparation for a @entity35 qualifying campaign so simple that @entity2 can not fail to make it to the finals in @entity38			1
the general lack of interest is a direct result of finishing on the soggy bottom of a @entity26 group won by @entity44 , and the feeling of apathy is more dangerous for the @entity47 than one of anger which has taken hold in the past , when the nation expected more of its team			0
@entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 have gone , taking with them 300 - plus caps of experience and the last vestiges of a seam of talent so rich it forced @entity2 to believe and then blush with embarrassment when they did not deliver			2
meanwhile , those chosen to represent the future have problems of their own , such as how to get a game in the @entity71			1
the bulk of the £ 800million spent by @entity74 clubs went on foreign players and while @entity12 complains about ‘ blocked pathways ’ he knows there is little he can do to reverse the trend other than offer a few words of encouragement to the young players who will form the basis of his rebuilding operation			1
‘ i ’m loath to talk about eras , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s more a question of keeping things moving forward			0
’ but this represents ground zero as he starts the process of engaging a nation of 50 million and rewarding those loyal fans who stood to applaud a goalless draw against @entity44 in @entity95			0
he can barely afford another backward step			0
monday ’s @entity35 qualifier in @entity98 is the toughest game of the campaign and he can not surrender the initiative by losing the opening fixture			2
not just a friendly : @entity12 can barely afford a backwards step as he looks to engage a nation big chance : @entity106 captains the side on wednesday night and will hope to lead them to @entity35 in form : @entity109 and @entity110 have been in fine form for @entity112 so far this season @entity12 said all the things you might expect to lift the mood , as did his new skipper @entity106 , even though @entity118 ’s swoop for @entity119 raises questions about his future role in @entity123 ’s team			1
if it was down to former @entity2 and @entity118 defender @entity125 , he would be the next forced to the fringes once occupied by @entity127 and now featuring @entity128			2
‘ it ’s the cleft - stick situation , ’ said @entity12 , as he explained why good @entity20 players are wanted at the big clubs , but might not be good enough to play every week			1
@entity132 finds himself in this cleft at @entity134			0
@entity137 seems to exist one bad patch of form away from it			0
‘ i certainly feel i ’m capable of dropping back and i ’m sure one day i will , ’ said @entity106 when asked if he might become a midfielder , but for now the @entity118 striker will lead @entity2 from the front , in every sense			1
‘ i ’ve always said i do n’t want to finish my career with @entity2 having not won anything , ’ said @entity106			1
‘ i ’ve always wanted to win a trophy with @entity2 , and if i can lead us to do that , that ’ll be the pinnacle of my career			2
‘ that will be very difficult , but i really do think it ’s achievable			0
look at the players we ’ve got			0
they have to do what they do for their clubs with @entity2 , and we have to bring that together			2
that has to be our aim			0
’ trophy hunter : @entity106 insists he is still eager to win a trophy with @entity2 ... perhaps as a midfielder @entity163 : @entity106 has promised to be ' vocal ' and ' demanding ' as captain of the @entity2 as a captain , he promised to be ‘ vocal ’ and ‘ demanding ’			1
‘ i ’m harsh on myself and harsh on my team - mates , ’ he added , and did not seem bothered to hear @entity21 ’s @entity167 had called him ‘ chubby ’			2
‘ to be honest , i ’m not too interested , ’ shrugged @entity106 , who will win his 96th cap , before @entity12 noted : ‘ @entity106 ’s in fantastic physical condition			1
’ elsewhere there are good @entity20 players defying the system , of course			0
there is perhaps no more exciting talent in the @entity74 than @entity110 , who will start against @entity21 as @entity12 goes for energy and pace on the flanks in something of a return to his beloved 4 - 4 - 2 formation			1
‘ i do n’t need to get hung up as to whether it ’s the buzz formation of the moment , ’ said @entity12			2
‘ we do n’t intend to go down the road of three at the back at the moment , because we have players perfectly suited to playing in a four			0
’ now 's your chance : @entity12 admitted it was time for @entity195 to step up as an @entity2 midfielder up front , he will hope @entity106 and @entity199 gel more successfully than they have to date , while in central defence he will explore a partnership of @entity203 and @entity204			1
one of them , probably @entity204 , the second most capped outfield player in this side , must start to command at the back , but it is in central midfield where @entity12 will be desperate for signs of encouragement from @entity195 and @entity109			1
without @entity54 and @entity55 , the dearth of options is underlined by the fact the next cabs in the rank are @entity217 and @entity218			0
‘ most people have been thinking this could be the chance for @entity195 , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ i believe that too			0
i hope he and @entity109 can do well together			0
it ’s important for them to develop a relationship			0

almost 40,000 are expected at @entity4 , less than half the capacity
@entity2 players will struggle to get a game in the @entity71
the bulk of £ 800m spent by @entity74 clubs went on foreign players
*golden* generation has well and truly passed , now it 's on to @entity35
@entity106 to captain the side on wednesday night against @entity21
@entity12 admits this is a big chance for @entity195 in midfield
