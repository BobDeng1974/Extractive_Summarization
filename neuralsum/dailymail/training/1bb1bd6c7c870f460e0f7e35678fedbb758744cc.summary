@entity5 and @entity11 with their son @entity15			1
the couple 's daughter @entity19 died shortly after birth and now mr @entity11 has been told he only has five months to live after being diagnosed with cancer @entity19 who died shortly after birth			1
mrs @entity5 was told just 17 weeks into her pregnancy that @entity19 had multicycstic dysplastic kidneys , which prevented her lungs from growing however , by 2009 , mr @entity11 was diagnosed with a different form of testicular cancer and told that it could n't be cured			1
the couple then decided to have a child together , even though they knew that one day mrs @entity5 would have to raise the baby on her own and found out she was expecting twins			1
mrs @entity5 told @entity34 : ' i was so overwhelmed and blessed of course and feeling so grateful that i had two children			2
' but , i was scared because i knew someday i ’d be raising them on my own			0
' but just 17 weeks into her pregnancy , she was told her unborn daughter @entity19 had multicycstic dysplastic kidneys , which prevented her lungs from growing			0
mrs @entity5 knew that when she fell pregnant she would become a single mother after mr @entity11 had been told his testicular cancer was terminal their son @entity15 was born healthy although @entity19 died shortly after birth			1

mrs @entity5 told her terminally ill husband that he will get to be a father in heaven to @entity19 while she will look after @entity15 here she told @entity63 6 : ' i feel like we were blessed with twins because @entity8 is too good of a father not to be one in heaven			1
' he gets @entity19 in heaven and i get @entity15 here			0
' now the local community are rallying around the couple and raising money for them so they can enjoy as much time as possible together			0
the couple 's friend and fundraiser @entity73 said : ' it would be amazing to give them the gift of time , together as a family , so that @entity5 does n’t have to worry about working			0
' so , they can spend as much time together with @entity15			0
