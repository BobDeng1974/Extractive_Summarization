the @entity0 believe they now dominate @entity2 captain @entity1 whose nightmare start to the series saw him fail in both innings of the first @entity6 - along with opening partner @entity7			1
@entity2 finished on 116 - 3 to lead by 220 runs at the end of the third day in @entity10 with seven second - innings wickets standing			1
but the hosts are jubilant that struggling @entity1 has twice fallen cheaply to the plan of bowling at him full and swinging around off stump			2
@entity1 failed with the bat once again on day three of the first test in @entity10 captain cook also fell cheaply as he was out for 13 after edging a @entity20 delivery into the slips asked whether the @entity0 feel they have got the better of @entity1 , maiden test centurion @entity22 replied : ' yes , i think so			1
we worked to the plan of separating @entity1 's bat from his body and it worked			1
@entity20 stuck to the plan great			0
; @entity20 's pace partner @entity31 , who snared @entity1 in the first innings in similar fashion , said : ' everyone knows @entity1 has a weakness			2
' even more worrying for @entity2 is the form of @entity7 , whose footwork and head movement looked awry in both his brief knocks			2
the wisdom of him returning to the @entity2 side only 18 months after mental health issues forced him to quit the @entity45 tour after his first test roughing up by @entity47 in @entity48 now looks very questionable			1
@entity50 's test match special pundit @entity51 said : ' @entity7 's on the move , which is not great against the new ball			1
i do n't think he 's an opener			0
' @entity56 , whose four for 47 made him the pick of the @entity2 bowlers , was the typical team man when pressed about the opening pair 's struggles thus far			2
' i guess whenever you go through a challenge - for wickets or runs - it can get on your mind at times , but they 're both strong characters so i 'm sure there 'll be scores around the corner , ' he said			0
' it 's their own issue but we 'll stick with them			0
' @entity56 admits @entity2 's decision to fly @entity79 to @entity80 for the second test spurred him towards his four - wicket haul			1
asked about @entity79 linking up with the side on saturday , he said : ' it 's probably at the back of my mind but you try not to think too deeply about that			0
' i wanted to give them a bit of a headache , shall we say , and hopefully i 've done that now			0
' so it 's over to the people who matter to make that decision going forward in the series			0
there 's another important innings to come so hopefully we can knock them over and get the win			0
' @entity7 was also out cheaply as the first three wickets once again fell for not many @entity20 celebrates dismissing @entity7 for just four after he edged behind to @entity103 @entity7 added a score of four to his first innings duck in his first test since returning after an 18 month absence @entity108 also lost his wicket late on the third evening as @entity2 's first three wickets fell for just 52 runs @entity56 earlier picked up four wickets as @entity2 bowled @entity0 out for 295 in their first innings @entity22 celebrates his maiden test match century in his sixth test match			1

@entity1 's old failing against the full ball just outside off stump was again exploited by @entity0
@entity50 's test match special pundit @entity51 questioned wisdom of @entity7 returning to the @entity2 side
@entity2 *recovered* from a shaky start to end third day of first test on 116 - 3 in their second innings , a lead of 220
