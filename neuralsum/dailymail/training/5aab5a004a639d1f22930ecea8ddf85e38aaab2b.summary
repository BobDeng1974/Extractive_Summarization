by @entity0 published : 13:17 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 29 august 2013 a teenager who was ' out of control ' on mephedrone set off a makeshift nail bomb in a railway carriage and stole lethal potassium cyanide to build another device			1
@entity8 , 19 , could have caused serious harm , said a judge at @entity11 today as he jailed the youngster for five and a half years			1
' as it happens no - one was hurt , ' judge @entity13 told @entity8			1
' but had you had time to mix up the substances you had stolen there was potential for a very unpleasant explosion and the release of some very unpleasant gases including gases containing cyanide			2
' jailed : both @entity8 , left , 19 , of @entity25 , near @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , right , 27 , of @entity29 , @entity26 , were ' out of control ' on mephedrone at the time of their offences , a judge said @entity8 , of @entity25 , near @entity26 , @entity27 , pleaded guilty to arson , possession of explosive materials , burglary and theft of hydrochloric acid and potassium cyanide			1
he also pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and attempting to pervert the course of justice over an attack on a 16 - year - old mephedrone dealer , who was left in a coma for two and a half weeks and now faces health lasting problems			1
judge @entity50 sentenced @entity8 to two years in a young offenders institute for the explosives offences , three years for the attempted robbery and six months for perverting justice			1
he passed concurrent sentences for all the other offences @entity8 admitted , making his total term five and a half years			1
cuffed : @entity8 was sentenced to five and a half years after admitting a string of offences including an attack which left a teenage drug dealer in a coma also in the dock was @entity28 , 27 , of @entity29 , @entity26 , who pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery and perverting justice offences which he committed jointly with @entity8			1
he was jailed for four and a half years			1
judge @entity50 said it was clear that both defendants were at the time of the offences last year ‘ out of control ’ because of their use of mephedrone			1
their cases showed clearly that the use of mephedrone , a former ' legal high ' banned in 2010 and which is rife in @entity27 , is not harmess as many users think , said the judge			2
@entity80 , prosecuting , said @entity8 ’s first crime was theft of £ 100 worth of aftershave from @entity84 ’s on 29th june last year , police bailed him and he went on to make a nail bomb the following month			2
he put the device in a railway carriage in a siding at @entity26 station and set it alight on a disposable barbecue			0
pictures on his mobile phone showed how he had laid out nails , screws and snooker balls to make the device			0
he used masking tape to stick them to an aerosol can			0
mr @entity80 told the court that on september 11 last year @entity8 researched potassium cyanide and hydrochloric acid and then went on to burgle the @entity104 factory in @entity26			2
he took flour and a knife from one department and then - with the help of a 14 - year - old boy - containers of hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and potassium cyanide from another			0
he boasted to the boy , whom he paid £ 10 for his assistance , that one spoonful of the powder would kill 5 - 6 people			0
the containers of acid they took contained 30 litres each and needed the pair of them to carry them , mr @entity80 said			0
the next day police raided the 14 - year - old boy ’s house - where @entity8 had left the chemicals - and he was arrested			2
a @entity130 scientist found that , mixed in a paint tin , the pressure of the acid and cyanide would have caused a forceful blast , said mr @entity80			0
it would also have released poisonous hydrogen cyanide gas , the expert witness concluded			0
dangerous drug : the cases of @entity8 and @entity28 showed clearly that the use of mephedrone , a former ' legal high ' banned in 2010 , which is rife in @entity27 , is not harmess as many users think , said the judge the attempted robbery committed by @entity28 and @entity8 was on a 16 - year - old boy who was selling mephedrone in @entity26 , mr @entity80 told the court			1
@entity149 became popular among youngsters several years ago as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for @entity152 , the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets			0
chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern @entity158 , it is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy and the energising qualities of amphetamines , but with the short - lived hit of a line of cocaine			0
the @entity166 @entity168 drugs awareness service warns that it can also induce feelings of paranoia and anxiety , and overstimulate the nervous system leading to fits			0
for a while easily available through web sites sourcing it from @entity178 laboratories , the substance was finally banned in 2010 after it was linked to a string of deaths			0
the boy was lured to @entity182 , @entity26 , by a 14 - year - old girl he was seeing at the time who was working with @entity8 and @entity28			1
there he was waylaid by the pair			0
@entity28 hit him repeatedly on the head and he suffered two skull fractures and was in a coma in hospital for two and a half weeks			1
mr @entity80 said he had been left with damage to his sense of smell and hearing			0
he also has difficulty with recall and verbal fluency as a result of his injuries			0
@entity201 , for @entity8 , said he has been in custody on remand for almost a year and is now free of drugs and determined not to go back on them			2
@entity8 was a young man who had done badly at school except for science and he had since ‘ expanded that interest in an illegal way and he now recognises a potentially dangerous way , ’ she said			2
for @entity28 , @entity212 said he too had been abusing mephedrone and mixing with teenagers instead of facing up to his adult responsibilities - he has a partner and two children .			1

@entity8 , 19 , was jailed for five and a half years for a string of offences
@entity28 , 27 , jailed *alongside* him for attack on drug dealer , 16
both ' out of control ' on mephedrone at the time of their offences , judge says
