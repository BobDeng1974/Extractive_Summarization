for @entity1 ’s executive vice-chairman @entity0 , the summer months of 2013 amounted to a quite brutal induction into the highly - charged arena of transfer dealings at the highest level			2
on a damp monday evening in september , as the lights went out on @entity1 ’s frantic attempts to recruit stars of elite standing , @entity0 , red - faced and racked by self - recrimination , privately vowed that never again would @entity1 leave things so late			0
a hap - hazard , scattergun approach had been shown up and within the corridors of power at @entity16 , there was a recognition that @entity1 had come up short , signing only the lamentable @entity18			2
as the outlook at home appeared increasingly bleak , the chain of events that developed on the @entity36 entered the realm of the bizarre , descending into embarrassing acrimony , amid reports that three suited men , carrying leather briefcases , had emerged at the headquarters of the @entity46 league , apparently with the authorisation to seal a € 36 million move for the @entity50 midfielder @entity20			0
the alleged ‘ imposters ’ , as they were branded by the @entity65 – in reality , they were three highly reputable lawyers from the firm @entity55 – had been involved in pushing through @entity57 ’s signing of @entity58 the previous summer , possessing a an expertise in the legal issues that can complicate deals involving buyout clauses			0
@entity1 , for their part , denied any association with @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 – and the affable receptionist at @entity55 seemed more than a little perturbed when they received phone calls from @entity74 the following morning			0
@entity1 , who have their own lawyers in @entity46 , also bristled at suggestions they would need to call in experts to navigate their way through the @entity81 ’s complex tax rules , rather offended by the notion that a club of their size and reputation would be unable to confront relatively straightforward financial regulations			0
video @entity1 sign @entity20 for £ 28m learning : @entity0 ( left ) has learned from his mistakes of last summer , when @entity1 left it too late options : @entity92 considered signing @entity20 in january , but brought in @entity93 to join @entity18 instead in truth , @entity1 did not require the services of any legal experts that day , for they had no intention of matching @entity24 ’s buyout clause last summer , with the two clubs ’ valuations for the player set at around £ 10million apart			1
@entity1 ’s bid approached £ 25million but @entity92 and @entity0 resolved to push that bid no further , believing that they could not justify the extra expense at that stage			1
now taking in the reigns of three @entity1 managers , @entity20 has been a long - standing target at @entity16 , monitored consistently and closely since he played a starring role in @entity24 ’s mesmeric performance in a 3 - 2 victory at @entity16 in the @entity112 in 2012			1
he is one of several that @entity1 have continued to keep an eye on , along with midfielder @entity114 and forward @entity115			0
on a spring thursday evening , @entity1 could have been hit for six , as @entity117 ’s side utterly outplayed sir @entity119 ’s team			2
one that got away : @entity1 are set to confirm @entity20 's signing after making sure to get their man this time in the summer that followed , @entity119 and @entity1 scouts pondered long and hard but eventually felt that @entity20 should be allowed to develop a little longer in @entity46			1
ideally , they wanted him to score more goals , becoming the heir to @entity127 but there was also a concern that both @entity130 and @entity131 would provide competition for his signature			0
the decision was taken to wait until the next summer and the manager ’s brother , @entity136 , continued to monitor his developments			0
by then , of course , @entity119 had stepped aside , having laid the foundations for a move for @entity142 from @entity130 while @entity92 had assumed the hot - seat			0
it would be an exaggeration to say that @entity20 was the midfielder at the top of his wish - list , with @entity148 assuming that place , while plans to sign @entity142 were shelved , as @entity92 decided he required more extensive research into the player , who joined @entity57 instead			1
@entity20 , however , remained on the radar , with @entity92 recognising the urgent need for a player of style and substance in the central acres and he emerged as a serious target as the days counted down towards the end of the transfer window			2
fiasco : @entity1 were left embarrassed after lawyers claiming to be acting for the club got involved last summer @entity164 : @entity1 decided not to buy @entity20 ( left ) in 2012 , hoping that he would improve if left in @entity46 unfortunately , @entity20 could barely have been at a more unaccommodating club from @entity1 ’s perspective			1
@entity24 , who stand as a beacon of @entity50 national identity , maintain a long - standing philosophy to only utilise players from that region			0
such a small pool dictates that @entity24 demand the highest prices , often the buy - out clause , for their assets and @entity20 was no exception			2
there would be no short - cuts on this deal			0
@entity1 ’s early faith – a wage package is understood to have been agreed in principle last summer and there were even suggestions that a squad number had been set aside for @entity20 – diminished as the clock ticked down			1
@entity92 resolved to return for his man in january but @entity1 grew increasingly disturbed by @entity20 ’s disappointing start to the season			1
the speculation appeared to affect his form , @entity20 losing his place in the @entity24 starting line - up			2
as winter came , though , @entity20 rediscovered his touch , as his side struck 15 goals in three games in january and @entity92 came close to resurrecting a deal in the mid-season window			1
ultimately , he decided to settle for the signing of @entity93 alone			0
@entity1 ’s interest , however , had been rekindled and dialogue was maintained between the clubs			0
officials were aware that @entity20 , despite his stock waning somewhat over the last eighteen months , has remained in the thoughts of @entity130 and they recognise a midfield player with the strength and power to adapt to the rigour of the @entity212 and the graceful quality that has often eluded @entity1			2
pricey : @entity20 is thought to cost in the region of £ 28m , but his release clause increases in july this summer , @entity0 is leaving little to chance and having clumsily paid in excess of @entity18 ’s exit clause last summer , @entity1 were determined not to fritter away cash so easily once more			1
at the beginning of july , @entity20 ’s buyout clause at @entity24 is due to rise by several million pounds and it is this that has compelled @entity1 to act swiftly and pay a little more than they may previously have liked – the fee will be in the region of £ 28.4 million , including add - ons – to ensure they finally get their man			1
with @entity227 determined to reinforce the @entity1 midfield with energy and dynamism , @entity1 have returned decisively , believing that under the right manager , at the right club , they have a player that will live up to the potential that the 6 foot tall , 24 - year - old demonstrated on that march evening at @entity16 two and a half years ago .			1

@entity20 impressed at @entity16 for @entity24 in 2012
@entity1 tried to sign him last summer , including a fiasco with ' impostors '
@entity92 opted to sign @entity93 instead in january
@entity20 finally set to sign for @entity227 's side for £ 28.7m
