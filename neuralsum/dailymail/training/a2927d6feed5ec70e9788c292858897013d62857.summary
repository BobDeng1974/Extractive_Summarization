should @entity0 start for @entity1 at the @entity2 ? @entity3 dominates the headlines			1
after a rusty display against @entity6 , followed by @entity8 ’s decision to use him out wide against @entity9 , a debate has started : will he — or wo n’t he — start alongside @entity11 when @entity12 stand in front of @entity1 in @entity14 ? even if @entity3 was on top form , i would n’t play him in the second striker ’s position			1
it ’s a supporting role to @entity11 but , more importantly , it includes the job of nullifying @entity21			1
@entity3 was given that task in the @entity24 quarter - final , alongside @entity25 , and could not lay a glove on the veteran playmaker			1
of course , he can do it			0
he ’s done it to great effect for club and country over the years , but when i think of the best i ’ve seen @entity3 , it was the 2009 - 10 season			1
then , he scored 34 goals and won the @entity47 award as an out - and - out striker			2
do n’t forget , sir @entity49 used @entity50 as a second striker , rather than @entity3 , to stop @entity52 against @entity53 in the @entity54 the season before last			2
@entity52 is @entity53 ’s @entity21			2
it ’s not a matter of a lack of workrate from @entity3			2
in fact , i think he actually works too hard at times			0
and i ’m not jumping on the ‘ drop @entity3 ’ bandwagon either , but for tactical reasons i ’d rather see a midfielder being asked to pester @entity21			1
trophy boy : @entity3 scooped the @entity67 in 2010 after scoring 34 goals having @entity69 , say , or @entity0 in there , with a midfielder ’s mentality , would be more solid than having a striker dropping off from deeper			2
they would normally have @entity21 in front of them so they can see him — @entity3 would be checking over his shoulder — and both have the ability to run past the @entity81			1
do n’t forget , also , that the gifted young @entity83 midfielder @entity82 will also be looking to cause problems for @entity1			2
neither he nor @entity21 can be given space to create			0
a striker will , at times , be 20 to 30 yards away from @entity21 with a lot of ground to make up — and has @entity3 got enough fitness to do that job in these conditions ? chasing shadows : @entity3 could n't get near @entity12 's @entity21 in @entity24 it may seem harsh when @entity3 is the fifth highest goalscorer in @entity1 ’s history after he scored against @entity9 in @entity96 , along with six goals in eight games in the qualifying programme , but @entity11 is currently the best option to play at centre forward			1
that means @entity3 has to play wide			1
this , though , does not mean he is filling a limited , defensive role			0
quite the opposite , in fact			0
he would be asked to attack from the left , like @entity108 does for @entity109			0
there is a big difference with that job compared to a left midfielder			0
talk has been about @entity11 and @entity3 creating a partnership similar to the @entity117 pairing of @entity11 and @entity108			1
i ’ve watched them a lot this season and they have been lethal with their goals in the @entity125 , but i would n’t say there was great chemistry between them			0
making history : @entity3 's goal against @entity9 moved him up to fifth in the all - time @entity1 scoring charts in the mix : @entity0 ( left ) should be deployed to thwart the inspirational @entity21 they are two top strikers , but it is too simplistic to say they played as a pair all season			1
when @entity117 used a back three and a diamond formation , both systems give you the numbers in the centre of the park and allow you to play a front two			2
the diamond would be my choice against @entity12 , with @entity3 and @entity11 supported by @entity0 or @entity69 to choke the space around @entity21			1
i doubt @entity151 will be included , given that he has played so little in the warm - up games			0
but it looks like @entity8 will deploy two sitting midfielders with three supporting a single striker ( @entity11 ) in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system			1
another question for the management would be : do they believe @entity3 and @entity11 can complete those three group games in nine days and in these conditions ? i do n’t believe they can			1
centre stage : @entity117 star @entity11 is set to spearhead @entity1 's attack in @entity165 having worked with @entity11 , he is prone to a niggle between games and that could mean missing vital tactical sessions or missing the next game			1
@entity3 has been criticised for his performances in tournaments since @entity173 2004			0
i do n’t think his ability is in question , more his adaptability to play in those conditions at the end of a season			0
there have been plenty of times when i ’ve seen him looking shattered as we ’ve struggled to keep the ball , and he ’s chasing shadows			0
with three games in quick succession , what would sir @entity49 , @entity186 or @entity187 do at club level towards the end of a season ? they would rotate			0
we never do it , as there ’s a fear that if it goes wrong , the manager will be hung out to dry			0
but the manager needs to make bold decisions			0
plenty to ponder : @entity8 must decide where best to use @entity3 @entity3 and @entity11 with @entity50 as a front three gives versatility and unpredictability			1
they can all play from the flanks or through the middle , so there can be lots of interchanging , which would mean @entity12 could never relax			2
@entity3 and @entity210 are two of the best players in the squad and i have no doubt they could be dangerous as a pair , but in the biggest games against top opposition i do n’t think there ’s room for both through the middle			0
@entity8 has a reputation for playing it safe but i feel this tournament is about being brave with selection and changes from the bench .			0

@entity117 star @entity11 should spearhead @entity1 's attack
@entity3 should play out wide - not in second striker 's position
@entity235 forward could not lay a glove on @entity12 's @entity21
