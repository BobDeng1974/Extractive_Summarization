@entity0 was locked in a bitter war of words with the @entity3 last night over the credibility of a defector with links to a convicted kidnapper			1
the anti-eu party had been left licking its wounds on saturday night when @entity11 mep @entity10 announced he was leaving for the @entity12			2
but mr @entity0 hit back yesterday , saying mr @entity10 had already been facing suspension over a string of issues , including claims that he had links to a man jailed for his involvement in a kidnap plot in @entity21 and alleged expenses irregularities			1
@entity11 mep @entity10 announced over the weekend he was leaving for the @entity12 , prompting the party 's leader @entity0 ( left ) to hit back , saying mr @entity10 ( right ) had been facing suspension over several issues the @entity11 leader launched an all - out assault on mr @entity10 ’s record , claiming party officials had been ‘ increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the past few months ’			1
he told the @entity33 ’s @entity32 show that mr @entity10 ‘ did n’t tell us the truth ’ about the alleged employment of illegal immigrants in his restaurant business and warned there are ‘ some big open questions in @entity41 about money ’			1
there were also claims of interference in candidate selection in @entity47 , @entity48 , and links with ‘ political extremists ’ from @entity21			0
@entity11 suspended mr @entity10 on saturday evening after getting wind that he was about to defect			1
the mep , who was once paraded by @entity11 as a symbol of the party ’s diversity , yesterday accused his former leader of a ‘ desperate attempt ’ to smear him			2
mr @entity10 said there was ‘ not a shred of truth ’ in the allegations made against him			1
he claimed last night that mr @entity0 had even asked him to stand for @entity61 last week – a claim dismissed by @entity11 last night as ‘ risible ’			1
mr @entity0 said he was ‘ genuinely surprised ’ the @entity3 had accepted mr @entity10 into the party			1
in a further twist last night , @entity65 mp @entity64 claimed his party de-selected mr @entity10 as a council candidate ahead of the 2012 local elections			1
the @entity71 mp refused to say what the issues were that led to mr @entity10 ’s sacking ‘ but they were sufficiently grave to make us realise that he was not a fit and proper person to represent @entity80 ’			1
he added : ‘ clearly both @entity11 and the @entity12 have lower standards			0
’ a @entity3 source last night said mr @entity10 denied ever having any involvement with the left - wing @entity65			1
four million @entity86 citizens living in the @entity87 should be barred from voting in a referendum on @entity87 ’s relationship with @entity90 , @entity0 said yesterday			0
setting out his terms for a post-election deal with the @entity3 , the @entity11 leader claimed he wanted ‘ fair ’ rules for the @entity95 / out ballot pledged by @entity97			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i want a guarantee that the only people that can vote are @entity87 citizens because at the moment there are four million or so @entity86 citizens living in @entity87			2
’ currently , @entity86 citizens can vote in local and @entity90 elections , and in referendums – many took part in last year ’s @entity110 independence vote			0
but @entity111 believe they could sway the result in favour of @entity87 staying in the @entity86			0
mr @entity10 ’s defection was presented as a major coup by the conservatives , who are trying to squeeze @entity11 ’s vote ahead of the @entity119			1
@entity97 said he was ‘ absolutely delighted ’ by the @entity48 and @entity10 ’s decision			2
@entity3 party chairman @entity121 yesterday brushed aside claims against mr @entity10 , which include his on - going friendship with @entity125 , who was sentenced to seven years in jail in the @entity87 after admitting his role as the head of a kidnapping gang in @entity21			1
@entity11 claimed mr @entity10 had failed to end his association with @entity125 , despite warnings last year			1
but mr @entity121 defended him , saying : ‘ i ’m absolutely satisfied that this is somebody mainstream ... i ’m absolutely satisfied that he is a very moderate mep who has seen that the only way to deliver what he wants is through the conservatives			0
’ he added that ‘ they [ @entity11 ] want you to believe that they were going to get rid of this guy , exactly the opposite is the case ’			0
mr @entity10 claimed mr @entity0 ‘ runs the party like a dictator ’ and said the party had ‘ outlived its usefulness ’ because the @entity12 were now the best hope of a referendum on @entity90			1
he said : ‘ i have decided to leave @entity11 because it has become a vanity project for @entity0 and because many of the criticisms made of the party are true			2
@entity97 famously said that @entity11 was a party of “ fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists ”			0
‘ certainly , i have experienced racism in @entity11			0
i have been racially abused on social media by other @entity11 members who ask offensive questions like , “ are you a @entity166 ? ” ’ @entity11 denied he had been subjected to racism			0
party sources said allegations of financial irregularities in @entity41 would be passed to police			0
how this election coup turned into a debacle for @entity174 a series of controversies in the political life of @entity11 turncoat @entity10 should have set alarm bells ringing among the @entity3 high command			2
but questionable behaviour , dating back nearly a year , was either missed or overlooked by the conservatives in their haste to secure a high - profile defector to their cause			0
the resulting controversy has overshadowed what should have been a major coup for @entity97			0
in february 2014 , mr @entity10 was ordered by @entity11 to break off all relations with a friend , political activist @entity125 , after it was revealed @entity125 had a conviction for leading a kidnapping gang in @entity21			1
despite this , mr @entity10 was seen with @entity125 earlier this month at a hustings in @entity47 , @entity48 , where there are allegations of vote - rigging that are now the subject of an internal inquiry			2
posing for the cameras : @entity202 ( left ) with prime minister @entity97 at the weekend in july last year , the @entity21 - born businessman was again warned about his political associates			0
as recently as last week , the @entity205 was summoned to a meeting with party leader @entity0 where he was due to be handed an ‘ ultimatum ’ over his conduct following the incident in @entity47			2
@entity11 allege that he did not show up , although mr @entity10 claimed last night that mr @entity0 had made no mention of an ultimatum and had instead invited him to stand for @entity61			1
the colourful allegations against mr @entity10 should have been enough to raise concerns – or at least provoke further investigation – at @entity215 ( @entity215 )			2
yet it appears that any questions over his behaviour or political associations were swept aside by the @entity12 in their rush to secure his defection			0
three days later , mr @entity10 confirmed to his @entity3 contacts that he was prepared to jump ship from @entity11			1
a hurried meeting was arranged with @entity97 before the prime minister flew to @entity226 for the funeral of @entity228			0
acquaintances : @entity202 ( centre right ) with @entity125 ( far right ) and @entity11 's @entity0 ( left ) @entity215 also arranged a secretly recorded and embargoed interview with the @entity33 to be rolled out on announcement of the news			2
but the next day at 4pm @entity11 somehow learned of mr @entity10 ’s defection plans			1
within an hour and a half it was announced he was being suspended pending investigations into ‘ extremely serious ’ allegations			0
@entity11 also began to ‘ accelerate ’ disciplinary proceedings against their mep			0
half an hour later , the party formally received his resignation and his defection was confirmed			0
but thanks to @entity11 ’s intervention , and the resulting row , a series of pre-arranged interviews with broadcasters were cancelled by the @entity12			0
the end result was a botched defection which risks leaving @entity215 with egg on its face amid questions over what , if any , due diligence had been carried out by @entity3 planners on their new recruit .			0

@entity202 said ' @entity11 is *pointless* ' before defecting to @entity3 party
he said @entity11 was ' pretty amateur ' and had a ' *ridiculous* ' lack of policies
@entity0 has hit back saying mr @entity10 had been facing suspension
said he was ‘ genuinely surprised ’ conservatives had accepted mr @entity10
