' this is to avoid using clay that is impure ( be careful as many of these exist on the market )			2
' @entity121 and bentonite clay has a molecular structure that is negatively charged , so it will attract other components ( eg heavy metals ) which have a positive charge			2

' people often assume they can use the clay alone , which we do not recommend , since once the clay has done its work - you do need to make sure it is moved out of the bowel effectively to remove the waste collected within the clay			0
