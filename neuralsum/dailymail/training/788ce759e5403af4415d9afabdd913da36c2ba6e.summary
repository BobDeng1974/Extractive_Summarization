a strange animal captured by a @entity2 couple and believed to be the legendary ' goat sucker ' beast el chupacabra has been put to sleep			1
@entity7 and her husband @entity8 discovered the hairless , growling creature eating corn outside their @entity13 home on sunday but have since had it euthanized because it appeared to be suffering			1
' it went to sleep peacefully , ' she told @entity18			0
' i had gotten attached			0
i was calling him @entity21			0
the woman also told the gossip site that she had received several complaints over the bizarre animal being kept in a cage and not receiving proper care			2
the couple was in disbelief after first discovering the creature , which she said is likely only a raccoon with mange			1
' he called me to come and look , and i said ' @entity8 that looks like a baby chupacabra , ' @entity7 said			0
the animal was not very large -- perhaps the size of a house cat			2
but its wrinkly black skin and bulbous eyes still lent it a look of menace			2
the couple kept it in a cage , fed it and made sure it had water			0
they also gave friends and neighbors the opportunity to come take a peek			0
neighbor @entity76 spoke from experience , and insisted it was likely the blood - sucking chupacabra			2
' i hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and i ai n’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there , ' @entity85 told @entity86			0
' we 've never seen anything like it before ' : the couple has kept the animal around in order to show it around in hopes someone can id it @entity7 shows where she first happened on the animal she thinks is a chupacabra ' i hunted coons for 20 years with dogs and i ai n’t ever seen anything that looks like that right there , ' said the @entity104 ' neighbor @entity76 and his identification was n't just based on looks : ' a coon does n’t make that noise , or a possum			2
what makes that noise ? i guess a chupacabra does , ' @entity76 said			0
@entity7 and her husband say they kept the animal in a cage , not to harm it , but out of curiosity			2
' we were just trying to figure out what it is because we 've never seen anything like it before , ' @entity7 said			0
no chupacabra has ever been positively identified , of course , and if the @entity127 's find is ever @entity129 'd , it will likely be as a mammal , possibly with a parasitic infestation that has caused its hair to fall out			1
the stocks are feeding the animal and making sure it has plenty of water mangy ? many believe chupacabra sightings are nothing more than mammals like foxes or raccoons with hair loss caused by mange legend of @entity23 the word comes from two @entity148 words - ' chupar ' , to suck , and ' cabra ' , goat			1
the first reported sighting was in 1995 , when eight sheep were found dead in @entity152 with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood			1
thus , the legend of the livestock killing , vampire - like chupacabra was born			0
since then , the legendary beast has been spotted across the @entity160 and even the world			1
a @entity163 incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on @entity23 in 2012			1
earlier this year , yet another @entity166 sighting came when a @entity168 man actually shot and killed what he claimed was @entity23			1
even a @entity171 town had a @entity23 sighting this past july science attempts to explain scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be @entity23 are actually wildlife like coyotes , foxes , and stray dogs infested with parasites			1
most commonly pointed to is the parasite @entity183 , which causes mange			0
@entity185 is a painful , potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel , making for an even more ghoulish looking beast			1
in humans , @entity183 causes scabies and a consequent itchy , painful rash as the parasites burrow around , leaving their feces under the skin			0
' goat sucker ' : the legend of @entity23 likely originates from a 1995 case in @entity152 where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds			1
it has been described as hairless , or as having spines along its back , and as having blue or red eyes			0

the *small* , black *critter* that some believed to be the legendary beast was put down to end its suffering
most believed it was only a raccoon with mange that caused the animal 's hair to fall out
the story of @entity23 began in @entity152 when *farmers* found their goats dead and drained of all their blood
