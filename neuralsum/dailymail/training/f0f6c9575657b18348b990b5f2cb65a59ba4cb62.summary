in the end an entire season of @entity1 was decided by one man sitting in a lorry in a @entity6 car park			1
this unimaginably tense game - taken to extra-time by two magnificently committed and professional teams - came down to the wire			2
as @entity11 desperately hurled themselves at @entity12 ’ battered , bruised and exhausted defenders it looked as if the north @entity16 side were going hold on for two more seconds to claim the @entity19 title they so desperately craved			1
but out of the gloom at the bottom of the ruck , a pair of hands - belonging to @entity26 - reached out , inches from the line , and @entity11 ’s forwards celebrated			1
matchwinner : @entity26 scored a dramatic try in extra time as @entity32 beat @entity12 @entity33 's finest : @entity11 beat @entity12 24 - 20 on saturday to be crowned @entity19 champions @entity35 moment : @entity11 players celebrate their @entity19 final win diving over : @entity39 scored @entity32 ' opening try in their @entity19 final vs @entity12 all smiles : @entity43 ( right ) scored @entity11 's second try after collecting @entity46 's grubber kick try - time : @entity43 celebrates putting @entity11 12 - 9 ahead against @entity12 at @entity6 last gasp : @entity47 ( left ) scored a late try for @entity12 to force extra time in the @entity19 final @entity12 : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65			1
replacements : @entity43 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73			1
try : @entity47 penalties : @entity56 ( 3 ) , @entity72 ( 2 )			1
@entity11 : @entity39 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity46 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87			1
replacements : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96			0
tries : @entity39 , @entity98 , @entity26			1
conversions : @entity46 ( 3 )			0
attendance : 81,193 referee : @entity103 ( @entity104 ) not for the first time in the game , referee @entity103 was unsure whether to award the try and asked television match official @entity108 - sat in a broadcaster ’s trailer behind the @entity111 - for guidance			2
he had the @entity19 title in his hands and he immediately knew the magnitude of the call as a wry smile crossed his face			0
‘ i ’m not sure if that was a try , ’ @entity103 said			0
nobody in the ground was			0
eventually , after countless replays on the big screen , @entity108 decided in @entity11 ’s favour			0
they had won their first @entity19 title			2
@entity12 players dropped to their knees , knowing their richly promising season had seen them finish empty - handed yet again			2
the irony was , if fly - half @entity46 - or anyone else for that matter - had kicked a simple drop - goal attempt in the build - up to @entity26 ’s contested try , with @entity32 having scored two tries to @entity12 one , a final scoreline of 20 - 20 at the end of extra-time would have handed the @entity141 the trophy anyway			1
but they bet the house and won the lot			0
‘ i was sure i ’d scored it but i just was n’t sure if the cameras had seen it , ’ said @entity26 , sporting a black eye from an earlier collision which had left him needing extensive treatment on the floor			2
so close : @entity72 could have won the final for @entity12 in normal time but his conversion hit the post on the mark : fly - half @entity56 kicked @entity12 into an early 6 - 0 lead at @entity6 ‘ thankfully , it did			1
it was one of the most ferocious games i ’ve ever played in and the extra- time took its toll fitness-wise			0
it was an incredibly tough game			0
’ technically , probably , awarding @entity26 ’s try was the right decision			0
but it was also almost unimaginably cruel for a @entity12 side who finished the regular season nine points clear at the top of the table and are , on balance , the best side and deepest squad in @entity33			2
to compound the @entity16 ’s agony , they believed @entity56 had scored a legitimate try after 63 minutes only for @entity103 to again defer to @entity108 while the @entity12 fly - half had treatment on the floor for a lower leg injury he sustained kicking the ball into the crowd in celebration			1
with @entity51 lining up the conversion , @entity108 — who moments earlier had declined to refer a blatant forward pass from @entity77 to @entity78 in the lead - up to @entity43 ’s 58th - minute try — prompted @entity103 by asking him ‘ is there anything you ’d like to check ? ’ and upon review he decided that @entity12 full - back @entity51 ’s flicked pass to @entity73 was marginally forward and the ‘ try ’ was chalked off			1
it prompted a furious response from chief executive @entity198 after the game			0
‘ most teams in the @entity19 would say the protocol has become a shambles , it ’s almost “ make it up as you go along ” , ’ said @entity198			0
‘ some referees use the @entity209 as a kind of video operator , “ show me that again please ” , others take instruction , others take guidance			0
‘ this sounds like sour grapes but it is n’t , because this would be the case had that final try not been given			0
‘ the @entity209 process is a shambles			0
’ false dawn : @entity56 ( centre ) thought he had scored @entity12 ' first try of the game but it was disallowed hoof : @entity56 injured himself after booting the ball in celebration before referee @entity103 ruled out the try ouch : @entity56 ( right ) was attended to by a physio ( left ) before he was replaced by @entity72 distraught : @entity56 was replaced after injuring himself celebrating his disallowed try in the second - half after last week ’s crushing defeat to @entity236 in the @entity238 final at the @entity239 , it was astonishing to see the @entity12 players flinging themselves into every contact as if it were the first game of the season			1
the courage on display from both sides was remarkable , even by modern rugby ’s standards			0
in keeping with the warrior spirit which has served them so well all season , and led superbly by @entity61 in his 265th and final @entity19 appearance , @entity12 refused to accept they were out of the match at 14 - 9 down with seven minutes to play and continued to press until @entity47 squeezed over in the corner to level proceedings			1
fly - half @entity72 — another player fortunate to still be on the pitch after being knocked into next week , seconds after replacing @entity56 , by a thunderous hit from @entity84 — hit the right - hand upright from the tightest of angles and match entered its extra time drama			1
up for grabs : @entity12 and @entity11 were competing for the @entity19 trophy on saturday breaking through : @entity77 ( second left ) holds off @entity56 ( left ) and @entity47 ( second right ) passionate following : @entity11 supporters were out in full force for their team at @entity6 there are so many ‘ what ifs ? ’ for @entity12			1
what if @entity272 , so desperate to win he was almost combusting , had not been penalised for crossing seven minutes into added time , leading to @entity276 ’s effort being disallowed ? what if @entity278 had spotted @entity77 ’s earlier forward pass in the lead up to @entity43 ’s second - half try ? what if @entity72 had kicked that conversion ? but in the end this group of arch pragmatists , coached expertly by ulsterman @entity287 , will know there are no prizes for second place			1
‘ it was a strange game and a strange finish , ’ said @entity46			2
‘ we probably did n’t deserve to win because in a game like that it ’s a shame either side has to lose			2
’ the debate on whether an entire season should be decided by one man watching a television screen in a truck will rage on			0
but this was high drama , no doubt .			0
