the statue bears a plaque with a quote from @entity1 , which reads : ' they are few in number , but they have the right to live in peace , to choose their own way of life and determine their own allegiance ' but the sculpture of @entity1 has sparked a new row between @entity9 and @entity3 , with the @entity73 country 's @entity71 ambassador condemning the statue ' in our @entity5 ' as a provocative move , saying : ' what the @entity9 is doing is celebrating war			1
' her anger was echoed by veterans ' leader @entity81 in @entity83			0
he said : ' the statue is not a symbol of democracy			0
it 's her fault so many died			0
' he said @entity1 ' could have avoided the war and the deaths '			0
about 650 @entity3 personnel also died in the two - month long conflict , and three @entity5 lost their lives			1
@entity93 will provide 24 - hour surveillance around the ' @entity95 ' to prevent it being defaced by those who contest @entity9 sovereignty			2

we 're delighted to welcome her home			0
' mr @entity109 believes the bust will become a tourist attraction , adding : ' she is an integral part of the islands ' history and it is entirely appropriate that her image will gaze down on visitors and that she will remain in the @entity5 for ever			0
' the row is the latest in a recent series of flare - ups between @entity3 and @entity9			1
earlier this year , @entity129 and his top gear team were forced to flee @entity3 during filming of the show 's @entity132 special , which aired on the @entity134 last month			1
an angry mob took offence at the ' @entity138 ' number plate on @entity129 's @entity139 , which some interpreted as a @entity5 reference , but the production team maintain was a coincidence			0
in july , @entity3 's football chiefs were fined £ 19,500 by @entity144 after their players posed with a political banner laying claim to the @entity5			2
the players stood behind the slogan ‘ @entity5 son @entity150 ’ ( the @entity5 are @entity3 ) at a june 7 friendly against @entity152 in @entity83			2
waged over the course of ten weeks , the @entity153 was sparked when @entity3 invaded remote @entity9 territories in the @entity156 on april 2 1982 in an attempt to establish the sovereignty it had long claimed over them			1
@entity161 , which refers to the islands as @entity5 , had claimed it had inherited them from @entity164 during the 1800s			0
the invasion prompted the @entity9 , which had ruled the islands for 150 years to retaliate , a task force to reclaim the @entity5 , with prime minister @entity1 saying the 1,800 @entity168 were ' of @entity9 tradition and stock '			1

on may 21 , 3,000 @entity9 troops landed at the @entity198 settlement in @entity199 , bringing ashore 1,000 tons of supplies to establish a beachhead , with the plan being to launch attacks on there on @entity205 and @entity13			2
on may 28 , troops from 2 @entity207 attacked @entity205 and @entity208 , with fighting lasting through the night and into the following day			0
the @entity9 troops were hugely outnumbered but ultimately successful			0
