@entity15 : @entity9 shortly after she was rescued from the drain and taken to @entity17 , in @entity18 , @entity19 recovery : without her spines to keep her warm , @entity9 was left shivering			1

mr @entity13 , founder of @entity31 , said : ' when , eventually , she was out of the drain the shock was having no spines at all on her front end with only her rump being normal			2
' the bald skin seemed to have been attacked with almost an acid			0

' twice daily @entity55 soon took to relishing that @entity26 massage , ' mr @entity13 said			2
' she even stayed relaxed and started unrolling as she grew to love the pampering			0
' her skin looked healthy but i was unsure if she would ever regrow her spines			0
then just after @entity62 a short stubble appeared			0
' every day since we have seen more proper spines emerging			0
give her a couple of months then she will be able to be released back in the wild			0
