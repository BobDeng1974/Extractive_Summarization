the @entity0 has been reduced to 54 holes after heavy rain caused lengthy delays in @entity4 on friday with only six players , including leader @entity6 , completing their second rounds			1
some players came into the day yet to complete their opening rounds after a downpour ended play early on thursday , and the start of the second round was also delayed in the morning due to more rain			1
when players did get out on course , it was @entity17 who made the biggest impression , playing his first 10 holes in six under par to move one shot clear of @entity23 at the top of the leaderboard before the rain came again			1
@entity6 of @entity27 smiles on the 8th green during round two of the @entity0 , as the @entity17 leads following a disruptive day in @entity4 spectators wait in waterproof clothing as play is suspended due to heavy rain at the @entity0 play eventually got back under way at 5.45pm but it was clear that almost half the field would be unable to even start their second rounds and the decision was made to reduce the tournament to 54 holes shortly after			1
once back out on the course , @entity6 picked up where he left off - registering four more birdies to card a 61 and finish the day on 18 under , three shots clear of @entity43 who would have to return to complete the last two holes of his second round on saturday morning			1
before the stoppage @entity6 , who started on the back nine , had flown out of the blocks with a birdie before hitting three more in a row from the 13th to the 15th - his pitch mark on 13 being within a foot of the pin			2
he picked up another on 17 before chipping in on the first but @entity43 , who held a three - shot overnight lead after just missing out on a 59 on thursday , had kept pace with him with birdies at 12 and 15 before the rain returned			0
@entity6 was not fazed by the long break and his one - shot lead soon became three as he birdied the second while @entity43 , who had also started on the back nine , dropped a shot on the first			2
@entity6 recorded further birdies on five , six and nine to complete his sparkling round but former @entity67 player @entity23 is made of stern stuff and picked up shots on four , five and seven to stay in touch			1
the truncated nature of the tournament means that @entity6 will not now play again until sunday but the 24 - year - old is glad for the rest after a marathon day			2
