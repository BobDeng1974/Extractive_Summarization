by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 @entity3 's @entity2 campaign is all but over following a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity5 in @entity6			1
the result leaves @entity3 bottom of @entity9 with zero points and needing @entity11 to win their two remaining matches and hope they can beat @entity15 themselves on tuesday			1
exposed from corners at near post and he should have sorted that			0
@entity41 5.5 did n’t close down @entity42 for goal but made up for it with his lungbusting role in equaliser			1
@entity47 6 best of the defenders but should have gone with @entity17 for second goal			1
despair : @entity47 is consoled by @entity51 following the defeat which all but ends @entity3 's @entity2 @entity53 5 flicking at the ball rather than making proper clearances and at fault for @entity17 ’s first goal			1
@entity58 's in first gear : @entity53 was caught out for @entity17 's opening goal @entity61 5.5 the step up in class has been too quick			1
finally got forward more in the second half			2
@entity65 gerrard 5.5 crossed well for @entity51 ’s chance and sprayed the ball well			2
calm down : @entity70 is spoken to by referee @entity71 @entity72 6 an alright performance defensively			2
covered a lot of ground			0
used the ball well at times			0
@entity77 5 could n’t get him on the ball enough			0
could have interchanged better with @entity51			2
attention : @entity77 did not impact early in the game like he had against @entity11 @entity51 6 some poor misses but persisted and got the goal he and @entity3 so desperately craved			1
at last : @entity51 drew @entity3 level with his first ever @entity2 goal so close : @entity51 reflects after his first - half free - kick curled narrowly wide @entity87 4.5 international pace but needs to link better			1
comes inside a lot but never runs at his opponent			0
good movement but a bit wild in the final third			0
substitutes @entity102 ( for @entity77 64 ) 6at least he tried to beat men			0
@entity104 ( for @entity87 71 ) @entity105 and helped spark the brief revival			0
@entity108 ( for @entity72 84 ) @entity107 late to make an impact manager @entity111 5.5 wrong to move @entity77 out wide			0
should n’t have changed his formation from the @entity11 game			0
knee bother : @entity17 was back in the @entity5 starting line - up following knee surgery @entity5 @entity117 : 6.4 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity118 6 ; @entity119 6 @entity120 6.5 , @entity121 5 , @entity122 6.5 ; @entity123 6 ( @entity124 80 ) , @entity125 6.5 ( @entity126 67 , 6 ) , @entity127 7 ; @entity128 6 ; @entity17 7.5 ( @entity129 89 ) , @entity42 7 @entity130 - @entity17			1

@entity17 scored first - half header from @entity42 's cross
@entity51 equalised from close - ranger after @entity41 *centre*
@entity17 won the game after an error by @entity70
@entity51 missed two gilt - edged chances earlier in the match
@entity3 all - but *eliminated* from @entity2 after two defeats
they play @entity15 on tuesday in final @entity148 match
