with the impressive @entity1 as his backdrop , @entity0 is stood reflecting on his previous visit to @entity4			1
of course , we all know what happened the last time @entity0 was in the @entity7			1
the infamous photographs from @entity0 ’s boys ’ trip to @entity13 tells its own story			1
and speaking publicly for the first time since those unsightly snaps emerged , @entity0 is hugely repentant			1
‘ of course , i regret it , ’ said the @entity18 midfielder			1
‘ i ’ve been seen doing it before , i said then i made a mistake and i made a mistake again			0
i ’m young , i ’ll learn from it			2
i realise the consequences it has and the effect on kids growing up			0
i have kids myself and i do n’t want them growing up to think their dad smokes and it ’s ok for a footballer to smoke because it ’s not			0
it ’s unacceptable and i will accept the consequences and i will move on			0
’ we have heard it all before , though			0
when caught smoking outside a @entity53 nightclub in october , just days before a @entity49 clash against @entity50 , @entity0 was again apologetic			1
at the time , he insisted he was not a smoker and that there would be no repeat of the episode			0
nine months later , @entity0 is in the same boat , making the same mistake , making the same apology			1
making amends : @entity0 speaks to manager @entity23 during @entity18 's pre-season tour of the @entity4 high fliers : @entity0 takes a selfie with @entity65 en route to @entity67 @entity68 : @entity18 players chat with @entity71 legend @entity70 at the @entity72 , @entity73 however , there is a sincerity about the 22 - year - old this time — a sense that he truly has learned his lesson			1
@entity81 , of course , will prove whether his latest remorseful pleas are as empty as the ones he made last year			0
but he is certainly going the right way about righting the wrongs of his trip to @entity8			1
@entity0 returned to pre-season training four days earlier than planned and — ahead of saturday night ’s friendly against @entity92 — he has been at the forefront of the @entity18 ’s promotional campaign as they look to tap into the @entity4 ’s vast earning potential			1
of course , a couple of drags on a cigarette and a few glasses of champagne are unlikely to have a huge effect on @entity0 ’s fitness			2
but it is the fact he has put himself in that position yet again that has infuriated manager @entity23 , who is a staunch anti-smoker			1
‘ this whole thing does motivate me to try harder in training			0
it motivates me to improve because a lot of people start to talk about me — people who do n’t know me but want to have an opinion and it is down to me to let my feet do the talking , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i came back early to show people my commitment			1
i do n’t like to talk about to it too much , but this is a big season for me			0
’ making the effort : @entity121 midfielder insists smoking incident has motivated him to work harder in training stalled : @entity0 is no longer guaranteed a starting place in @entity18 's first xi enter the dragon : @entity127 ( @entity128 ) has established himself as @entity18 's first choice central midfielder indeed			1
this is perhaps the biggest season of @entity0 ’s fledgling career			2
once hailed as the leader of @entity18 ’s next generation , the @entity121 international ’s career has stuttered over the past 18 months			1
and with @entity127 now established as the club ’s premier central midfielder , @entity0 is no longer a certain starter for @entity23			1
injuries have not helped @entity0 ’s cause			2
but he is also honest enough to admit that he must start shifting through the gears if he is to fulfil his undoubted potential			0
the £ 30million capture of @entity143 from @entity144 will make it even harder for @entity0 to secure a regular spot in the team next season			2
committed : the @entity71 schemer returned to training early in an effort build his pre-season fitness incoming : @entity0 is excited by the arrivals of @entity154 ( @entity128 ) and @entity143 ( r ) he insists , however , that the club ’s new talent — including @entity157 right - back @entity154 — will only serve to make the team and himself stronger			1
‘ i think over the past few seasons i ’ve had a few injuries			0
i ’ve got going , had to stop and get going again , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ this season i ’m looking to have a really great pre-season and get a really good base of fitness and take that into the season			0
‘ the new signings will definitely give us a lift			0
it has been different this summer			0
this year we ’ve been really positive and gone into the market and got a couple of really great players			0
we ’ve got to really try to take that into the later stages of the season and be a bit more mature and maybe we can last the pace			0
’ a tad more maturity from @entity0 and he will certainly last the pace .			2
