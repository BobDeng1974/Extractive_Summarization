by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:18 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 08:02 est , 18 september 2013 @entity2 is heading for a landslide defeat when @entity4 go to the polls a year from today to save the @entity6			1
with 365 days until @entity4 's date with destiny , a major new opinion poll for the @entity4 @entity10 found support for independence is evaporating			1
and the first minister came under fire from a former aide , with ex-policy adviser @entity16 ridiculing the ' tedious ' yes campaign for relying on the same ' old songs '			1
child 's play : @entity4 first minister @entity2 holds up a child 's drawing on a visit to a childcare centre in @entity24 , with deputy first minister @entity25 looking on blow : a survey to mark a year to go until the independence referendum shows just 27 per cent of people back first minister @entity2 's bid for @entity4 to leave the @entity6 as the @entity33 's arguments for the break - up of @entity35 crumble , only 27 per cent of @entity4 now believe @entity4 should go it alone			1
and amid growing concerns about the impact of a @entity40 vote on jobs , pensions and trade , a massive 59 per cent are planning to vote no on september 18 , 2014			1
respected pollsters @entity44 - who correctly predicted an @entity33 majority in the 2011 @entity48 election - recorded the largest gap between the two camps for months			1
the survey suggests mr @entity2 is heading for a crushing defeat even if he wins over all undecided voters			0
mr @entity16 , who quit as the head of mr @entity2 's policy unit in july , said : ' the campaigns to date have been a tedious parade of union jacks versus saltires , of pop identity about caring @entity4 versus heartless @entity61			1
' writing in the @entity62 he added : ' what is really being asked is how do citizens and the state organise for the future in a sustainable way			0
' at its best , the nationalist movement knows this , and oﬀ ers a critique of what democracy and the state of the @entity6 can achieve			2
at its worst , it succumbs to the temptation to focus on old songs and tired policies			0
in this , @entity2 is wrong			0
' as the countdown began for the last year until voting takes place both sides sought to set out their key arguments			2
@entity84 , the former @entity85 chancellor fronting the @entity86 campaign against independence , said : ' there are three powerful reasons for being part of the @entity6			1
' one is economic : the opportunities and security that comes from being part of a larger country			0
' the second is we ’ve got influence in the @entity98 – it ’s the large countries that call the shots , not the small countries			0
' and thirdly of course there ’s something greater in this in some ways - i ’m @entity4 and i ’m @entity6			1
i ’m proud to be both and i do n’t see why anyone should make me choose between one and the other			0
' but @entity25 , deputy first minister , said the referendum was a ' once in a lifetime opportunity ' to back independence			2
she told @entity115 : ' my argument is simple : it ’s better to take decisions about @entity4 here in @entity4			2
' we ’ve demonstrated that principle over the past 14 years with the @entity4 parliament , we ’ve taken better decisions when we ’ve had the ability to do so on health and education ; we should also take that decision - making power over the economy and welfare as well			2
' in other findings , the poll found : about four million people aged 16 or over will be able to vote in the referendum , including all @entity6 and @entity98 citizens living in @entity4			1
it will cost taxpayers around £ 14million and the ballot papers will be counted by hand on the night of the referendum			0
polls have put the no campaign in the lead for months			0
a @entity143 poll last october recorded support for independence at 29 per cent , the same level recorded in another poll by the company in august			1
support for the @entity98 increased from 55 per cent to 59 over the same period			2
the @entity150 , drawn using data from @entity143 panel members in @entity4 , quizzed 1,051 adults between last friday and monday			2
@entity4 secretary @entity154 said : ' this is an absolutely defining moment and a once - in - a - lifetime choice			2
' that 's why i hope people will think carefully as they prepare for the vote			0
i firmly believe that @entity4 will be stronger , more secure and more prosperous if we remain as part of the @entity6			1
' but mr @entity2 said : ' the vote next year will be the opportunity of a lifetime for many people in @entity4 , as we get the chance to choose our country 's future			1
@entity4 can more than afford to be a successful independent country			2
we have enormous advantages in terms of our human and natural resources , but we need the political and economic tools to help create a wealthier and fairer society			0
' battle : deputy first minister @entity25 insisted @entity4 could go it @entity179 said he should not be forced to choose between being @entity4 and @entity6 date : about four million people aged 16 or over will be able to vote in the referendum next year they were asked the question that will be on next year 's ballot paper - ' should @entity4 be an independent country ? ' - and no additional questions that could sway the vote were asked			1
the results show backing for independence fell two percentage points since august , while support for the @entity98 held firm			0
professor @entity192 of @entity193 , @entity4 's leading elections expert , said : ' it 's not clear if the @entity40 side have made much progress in the past 12 months			1
' @entity2 has got a very substantial challenge on his hands if he wants to win a majority			0
' there has never been a time when a series of polls have shown a majority for independence and the @entity40 side has to create a majority that has never existed			2
' the poll found support for independence among men at 30 per cent and only 24 per cent among women - who are traditionally more sceptical about separation			1
that is down from 35 per cent among men since the last @entity143 poll in august , but shows a onepoint increase for the @entity40 campaign among women			2
backing for separation among 18 - to - 24 - year - olds is at 24 per cent , while @entity4 aged 35 - to - 44 are least in favour of independence ( 22 per cent ) , and those aged 45 - to - 54 are most supportive ( 35 per cent )			1
deal : @entity223 and @entity2 signed referendum agreement in @entity225 , @entity24 in october 2012 the proportion of respondents in the @entity228 planning to vote @entity40 is 23 per cent , rising to 35 per cent in @entity229			1
better together director @entity230 said : ' with a year to go , we take nothing for granted			0
' however , it seems clear that increasing numbers of @entity4 believe that @entity2 is putting the success of devolution at risk with his campaign for independence			2
the credit for this strong showing goes to the thousands of activists who have been in every community across @entity4 , talking to undecided voters about how we have the best of both worlds with a @entity4 parliament backed by the strength of the @entity6			1
' but @entity253 chief executive @entity252 claimed ' momentum ' is with the separatist campaign			0
commenting on recent polls , he said : ' at this stage , those figures are very encouraging and show clearly that more and more people are either moving to @entity40 or are beginning to think about @entity40			0
' when people consider the consequences of a no vote , support for @entity40 increases			1
these polls accurately reflect what we are finding ourselves			0
' the poll also asked people how they would vote if a @entity48 election was held tomorrow			1
in a turnaround from recent surveys , 31 per cent said they would vote @entity85 and 25 per cent @entity33			1
share what you think the comments below have not been moderated			0
@entity277 girl , @entity276 , @entity6 , 5 days ago @entity278 is in the counties of @entity280 and @entity281 in @entity282 and no part of it is in @entity4			1
it is not and has never been the boundary between @entity282 and @entity4			0
if the scots choose independence @entity278 will remain @entity282			0
@entity289 , sittingbourne , 5 days ago i just hope that the @entity293 resigns after she has been defeated @entity295 - danny1966 , crawley , 18/9/2013 11:22 totally agree which is she will be a more or less permanent addition to the @entity115 for the next year @entity289 , sittingbourne , 5 days ago as we pay for the drunks and the benefits we should be given a vote too			2
( i 'd votes yes ) @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity6 , 6 days ago why do the @entity282 never get a vote on secession and independence ? @entity311 , @entity229 , 6 days ago 365 days to go and still the @entity33 ca n't answer simple questions like how will we defend @entity4 ? what will happen to taxes ? what passport will i have ? the list of questions is endless and still no answers			1
i know how ill be voting and it 'll be to be part of @entity35 ! ! @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , 6 days ago convince them to go ... they cost more than they contribute , just like @entity328 over here			0
to their credit though , they are saying it 's a " once in a lifetime opportunity " ; over here , it 's a " neverendum " with @entity328			0
@entity334 , @entity335 , @entity6 , 6 days ago hopefully the @entity4 will vote for independence and then @entity282 can use that as an excuse to jettison @entity339 and @entity340			1
@entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , 6 days ago i have nothing against @entity282 , it is @entity347 i detest			0
for that reason alone , i will ( postal ) vote yes			0
@entity350 , @entity351 , 6 days ago does anyone seriously think that @entity223 would have allowed the @entity4 referendum if he thought the @entity4 would vote @entity40 for independence ? compare this with the @entity98 vote that he 's put off for more than 4 years - and is only being allowed then ( if it happens ) to garner votes for himself for the next general election			1
@entity361 , @entity362 , 6 days ago the man is an eejit ! should be in charge of either a milk cart or planet @entity367 ...			0
