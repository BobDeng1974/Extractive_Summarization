the company said it expects that it will be ‘ smaller and less profitable ’ in the near term while it builds a more sustainable business for the future			1

the @entity47 is also bearing down on providers of short - term credit , proposing earlier in the summer a cap on payday lending meaning that from next january , interest and fees must not exceed 0.8 per cent per day of the amount borrowed			2

for a £ 100 loan over 30 days , meanwhile , it charges £ 37.15			0
