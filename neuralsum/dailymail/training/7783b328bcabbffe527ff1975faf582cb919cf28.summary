@entity2 ’s pioneering cancer treatment in the @entity3 will be paid for by the @entity4 after all , it was announced last night			1
the parents of the five - year - old , who suffers from a brain tumour , sparked an international manhunt when they removed him from an @entity4 hospital last month without the permission of doctors			1
@entity12 and @entity13 had applied for their son to be given proton beam treatment while he was being cared for at @entity16 but the health service rejected the request and recommended radiotherapy			1
it is believed to cost more than £ 60,000			0
a @entity32 was issued and the @entity33 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , were arrested in @entity36 where they owned a holiday home			0
they were taken into custody and released only after @entity2 had spent three nights away from his parents in a @entity36 hospital			2
eight days after they had removed @entity2 from hospital a high court judge gave them permission to fly to @entity23 to begin the treatment			1
@entity2 was transported to the @entity47 in the @entity3 capital to start his proton treatment earlier this month			1
doctors at the clinic have previously told how 70 - 80 per cent of patients in his condition survive @entity54 ( left ) and his wife @entity55 ( right ) were allegedlly warned that their son could have been taken away from them for 11 years if they questioned any decisions made by the authorities after the huge manhunt now , in a major u-turn , @entity21 said last night that it would fund the treatment under the reciprocal healthcare arrangements that exist within the @entity64			1
a spokesman for the health service said the cost was not yet known			0
@entity21 said in a statement : ‘ our thoughts are with @entity2 and his family as he begins follow - on radiotherapy			2
‘ now that @entity2 is in @entity23 , it is clearly best that he continues to be treated uninterrupted so the @entity4 has agreed to fund this care , as requested by his parents , in accordance with relevant @entity78 cross-border arrangements			1
@entity2 's parents have repeatedly told how they believe the proton beam treatment will help their young son @entity12 , 51 , and @entity82 , 45 , were reunited with @entity2 after 72 hours in a @entity36 jail and later dramatically granted permission by a high court judge to allow him to undergo proton therapy in @entity23 ‘ we all join in wishing him well , and greatly hope he makes a full and successful recovery			1
’ @entity2 is already said to be ‘ showing progress ’ at the @entity47 in @entity23			2
earlier this month the clinic said that he was ‘ smiling more and able to move his limbs ’			0
his attending doctor , radiation oncologist dr @entity93 , said : ‘ there is a 70 to 80 per cent survival rate for the condition such as @entity2 has			1
‘ there is now every reason to hope that he will make a full recovery			0
’ @entity2 is having a type of radiation treatment that uses beams of protons – one of the building blocks of atoms – rather than x-rays			2
they can be targeted directly at a tumour and stop once they hit the target instead of carrying on through the body as conventional x-rays do			0
this means much less damage is caused to surrounding tissue , according to the @entity4			0
earlier this month it was announced that proton beam treatment will be available in this country from 2018			1
@entity21 will spend £ 250million on two proton beam units in @entity122 and @entity123			1
the £ 30million @entity47 where @entity2 is to be treated boasts state of the art cancer - fighting technology			2
built in 2012 , the gleaming white lobby of the five - storey building on the outskirts of @entity23 appears more like a modern hotel – complete with an 18ft tropical fish tank and red sofas			2
the centre says its treatment is more accurate than conventional radiotherapy because proton beams stop once they reach their target			0
for brain tumours , this reduces the radiation doses to other parts of the body by 60 per cent and halves the risk of secondary tumours , staff claim			0
a course of treatment takes from five to 30 visits			0
sessions never last more than 30 minutes			0
treatment : @entity149 , chief medical officer of proton therapy ( right ) shows @entity54 ( wearing blue shirt and striped tie ) around the centre where his son will receive treatment for medulloblastoma			0

@entity21 confirms it will pay for proton beam treatment for @entity2

*youngster* will now undergo several more sessions at **specialist** @entity23 clinic
@entity3 doctors say 70 - 80 per cent of patients with @entity2 's condition survive
