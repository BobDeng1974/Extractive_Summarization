gearing up for @entity6 : the enormous @entity5 warehouse in @entity16 , @entity17 , is already starting to fill up with thousands of boxes in preparation for the festive season organised : toys and gadgets are placed in the ' sortable ' areas which are divided up by cardboard screens scattered across the floor the hub : employees frantically type away at their computers as trollies of gifts are dragged around by employees items are placed on a conveyor belt around the clock and sent down the enormous warehouses to waiting delivery trucks which leave every 130 seconds			1

at the online shopping giant 's @entity51 , where 1,500 extra employees are being taken on over the festive season , the 35 - year - old general manager announced : ' we 're ready for cyber monday ... bring it on !

she said : ' we 'll wait to see if cyber monday - always the first monday in december - proves to be the busiest yet , but here in @entity21 we are definitely prepared if it turns out that way			0
' time consuming : staff have to scan every individual item which goes through the massive storage area so their progress through the delivery process can be monitored system : an letter and number code is used to distinguish the thousands of rows of gifts which employees have to sort through prepared : hundreds of yellow containers are stacked up in front of the seemingly endless collection of goods , ready to move the items so they can be shipped to thousands of addresses across the @entity12 the 700,000 sq ft centre in @entity22 was opened in 2008 and employee numbers have been growing ever since with , 2,000 - plus staff now working on the site			1
in the @entity12 @entity5 fulfilment centres , staff including ' pickers ' and ' sorters ' work four 10 - hour shifts a week which means employees now benefit from three days off			2

around 50 per cent more staff have been hired to cover the busy @entity6 period storage : stacks of nappies are separated by cardboard dividers which are set to make the routine more efficient busy : some of the thousands of seasonal workers taken on by the online shopping giants this year navigate their trollies around the warehouse while a woman folds up cardboard boxes ready for presents to be packaged and posted clockwork : the computer ' brain ' tracks every item as it makes it way from the lorry to the shelves before it is put into the boxes ready : a worker packs up a @entity146 next to a stack of flyers keeping track : a woman scans a dvd while nestled in between a set of shelves which are organised by an extensive system of yellow dividers miss @entity95 said : ' a lot is done by computer but some things are done better by hand			1
' the @entity5 fulfilment centre workers have a non-stop regime which involves receiving items from suppliers at its lorry dock			0

searching : an employee looks for an item in the shelves during his hectic daily routine which starts with workers receiving items from suppliers at its lorry dock process : a male employee scans a copy of @entity195 's @entity6			2
