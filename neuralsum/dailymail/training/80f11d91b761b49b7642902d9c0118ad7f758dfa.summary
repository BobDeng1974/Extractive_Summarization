by @entity0 novelist @entity1 - whose latest project is from the perspective of a dementia sufferer her best - selling novels are normally filled with dilemmas involving love and romance			1
but a dinner party with friends prompted @entity1 to deviate from the ‘ chick lit ’ genre she is known for and become the first author to write from the point of view of a dementia sufferer			1
miss @entity1 found herself moved by the difficulties faced by several aquaintances struggling to help loved ones with the illness but afraid to speak about their battles openly			1
the 45 - year - old has written 13 novels in 13 years , all of which have topped the @entity26 , but it is whatever it takes which was released last year , that she regards as one of her ‘ most rewarding projects ’			1
the novel tells the tale of a young mother who moves to the countryside to be near her husband ’s family and discovers that her mother - in - law has dementia			1
the narrative switches between telling the story from the perspective of @entity41 who has @entity43 ’s and her daughter - in - law			1
@entity49 about the novel for the first time and explaining the inspiration behind whatever it takes , miss @entity1 said she was moved by the heartbreak of a friend who had had to have her father tagged and placed in a care home as he battled the late stages of dementia			1
she said : ‘ the very first nugget of an idea came when i was at a dinner party			2
towards the end of the evening one of the guests kept getting phone calls about her father			2
we asked if she was alright then she started talking about him and how he was in the late stages of dementia			2
' she told us a horror story about how he had gone missing from his care home			2
he ’d left then forgotten where he lived			2
' then she said we ’ve actually got him tagged now and i feel terrible			0
people say it ’s taken away his liberty but she said , i just want him to be safe			0
my heart was breaking for her			0
' soon after that a close friend of mine told me his mother was n’t well but no one knew what it was			0
then after dozens of tests it turned she had @entity43 ’s			0
' so it was these two incidents that started the idea for the book			0
’ around 800,000 people in the @entity94 have been diagnosed with @entity43 ’s			0
miss @entity1 , a married mother of one , spent months meticulously researching and spending lots of time with dementia sufferers and their families before publishing her book for public consumption last year			1
the 45 - year - old has written 13 novels in 13 years , all of which have topped the @entity26 , but it is @entity106 which was released last year , that she regards as one of her ' most rewarding projects ' @entity109 , whose other bestselling titles include husbands and playing away , said : ‘ i ’m the first author to do this i believe , write from the point of view of a dementia sufferer in mainstream fiction			1
‘ i absolutely wanted to write from the @entity43 sufferer ’s perspective			1
it was essential to me – i did n’t want to write in a way that was just what everyone else thinks it must be like			0
the author 's latest novel @entity106 , which was released last year ‘ and as far as i ’m aware and as far as people who have written to me , lots of people – either those suffering from @entity43 ’s or families and friends – all have said we had n’t come across a book written like this before			1
’ and her depiction was ‘ exactly right ’ , she said			0
‘ i described dementia as a ‘ black smudge ’ on your memory … absolutely horrifying			2
‘ and the sufferers i spoke to said that ’s exactly what it ’s like , a bit of your memory that ’s just been rubbed out but you know used to be there ’ , miss @entity1 explained			1
she said : ‘ what was interesting , and very important to me , is that without exception everyone wanted to open up [ about ementia ] because it ’s almost a secret they feel they have to keep			0
‘ there was a definite sense of relief just being able to talk about it			0
’ according to a poll carried out by the @entity157 , to mark @entity158 which runs until may 24 , 41 per cent of those affected by the disease said they were keeping their concerns about it bottled up			0
