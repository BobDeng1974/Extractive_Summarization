by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob after trying 55 players over 22 games , @entity1 is set to gamble on youth when he names his @entity6 squad for the @entity7			1
@entity8 take a look at the 23 players set for a place on the @entity6 ' plane to @entity13 this summer			1
@entity14 @entity15 age : @entity17 : @entity18 caps / goals : 39/0 tournaments : 2010 @entity7 ; @entity22 verdict : recovered from the early season downturn in form			1
jolt of being dropped seems to have returned him to previous high standards and he has been crucial to @entity18 ’s title bid			0
safe hands : @entity15 will start in goal for @entity6 after recapturing his form for @entity18 @entity32 age : 31 club : @entity35 caps / goals : 6/0 tournaments : none verdict : @entity1 says that he does not chase retired @entity6 internationals — but he did so with @entity32 , wooing him back from exile to bolster his goalkeeping options			1
@entity32 made his debut in 200 , retired from international football in 2011 but returned in february last year			0
@entity45 age : @entity17 : @entity47 caps / goals : 1/0 tournaments : none verdict : a choice between @entity45 and @entity53 , 26 , who also has only one cap			1
both seen as good tourists but @entity45 edges it despite a difficult season for @entity47 which ended in relegation even before today ’s game with @entity60			1
selected for @entity22 but broke a fingerand missed out			0
in reserve : @entity47 's @entity45 should just pip @entity63 's @entity53 to a place on the plane @entity66 age : 29 club : @entity69 caps / goals : 50/1 tournaments : 2010 @entity7 ; @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 168.2 miles verdict : much depends on him , with @entity76 right - back @entity75 injured			1
needs to provide speed and energy going forward as well as defensive solidity			0
@entity81 age : 28 club : @entity84 caps / goals : 22/2 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 184.1 miles verdict : hugely improved this season , he was outstanding in the @entity92			0
he now needs to transfer that form to the @entity7			1
missed out on @entity22 after breaking his jaw			0
in form : @entity81 has excelled for @entity84 this season and looks guaranteed to start in @entity13 @entity97 age : 31 club : @entity100 caps / goals : 24/1 tournaments : @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 144.8 miles verdict : born in @entity105 of @entity107 descent , @entity97 is solid at club level but the hamstring injury that blighted the second half of his season will be a concern			0
opponents will feel @entity6 ’s defence is vulnerable			1
@entity115 age : 18 club : @entity118 caps / goals : 1/0 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 205.9 miles verdict : the key decision for @entity1 — and he is veeringtowards the 18 - year - old			1
can even expect to play at times as @entity6 may want to rest @entity126 for a game			2
on the plane ? @entity97 ( left ) and @entity115 ( right ) could both be on their way to @entity13 @entity126 age : 29 club : @entity100 caps / goals : 22/1 tournaments : @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 191 miles verdict : finally @entity6 ’s first - choice left back , having edged out @entity138			1
left athome in 2010 — having been named in the provisional squad — because @entity141 wrongly thought he was too introspective and would be homesick away from family			2
@entity143 age : 22 club : @entity146 caps / goals : 9/0 tournaments : @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 146.6 miles verdict : will be selected , with @entity151 ready to come in if the shoulder injury does n’t respond totreatment quickly enough			0
on the run : @entity126 is now @entity6 's no 1 left - back after ousting @entity138 @entity156 age : 24 club : @entity146 caps / goals : 10/0 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 128.4 miles verdict : not progressing as he should , his form has been marred by @entity146 ’s poor season			1
but provides covers at centre - half and right - back			0
made his debut against @entity172 in september 2011			0
@entity173 age : 33 club : @entity69 caps / goals : @entity178 tournaments : @entity180 , @entity181 , 2006 @entity7 , 2010 @entity7 , @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 203.9 miles verdict : a last tournament for the man who was an emerging star at @entity180			2
reinvention as a holding midfielder has been hugely beneficial for @entity6			2
captain fantastic : @entity173 , now 33 , will skipper the @entity6 in @entity188 @entity189 age : 23 club : @entity69 caps / goals : 8/0 tournaments : @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 230 miles verdict : transformed this season , his energy and tactical discipline make him natural starting partner for @entity173 , replicating their club link up			2
went to @entity22 after @entity204 ’s injury			0
@entity205 age : 22 club : @entity60 caps / goals : 15/0 previous tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 126.7 verdict : once the jewel in the crown of @entity6 ’s youngsters ; now critiqued by @entity216 as a player not developing			1
@entity1 believes in him despite another season dogged by injury			2
in favour : @entity1 is a big fan of @entity205 , despite the @entity60 man suffering an injury - plagued season @entity223 age : 20 club : @entity100 caps / goals : 3/0 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 174.9 miles verdict : a stunning goal and all - round performance against @entity18 seems to have tipped the balance as @entity1 opts for youth and vitality			1
@entity236 age : 19 club : @entity69 caps / goals : 2/0 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 154.6 miles verdict : there are few surprises in @entity7 football now but having only just broken through and never played in the @entity92 , @entity236 may shock a few opponents			1
presumably not @entity69 team - mate @entity248 , though			0
form player : @entity236 has enjoyed an outstanding campaign in @entity69 's dynamic midfield @entity252 age : 20 club : @entity60 caps / goals : 14/3 tournaments : @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 43.2 miles verdict : at his best a key player , shining in the @entity261 last year			1
can also play holding midfield			0
his current groin injury and the fact he has completed just three games this season count againsthim			0
@entity267 age : 26 club : @entity118 caps / goals : 3/0 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 249.9 miles verdict : will start for @entity6 , representing an extraordinary rise in the past 18 months			2
can be a key player either at wide left , wide right or behind the centre - forward			0
likely to move to @entity69			0
fresh blood : @entity118 's @entity267 has impressed during his three caps for @entity6 @entity280 age : 28 club : @entity18 caps / goals : 45/1 tournaments : 2010 @entity7 , @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 117.8 miles verdict : looked to be disappearing off the @entity6 radar but his key role in @entity18 ’s title run - in sees him retained and increasingly likely to play a key role off the bench @entity204 age : 35 club : @entity84 caps : @entity297 tournaments : @entity181 , 2006 @entity7 , 2010 @entity7 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 130.6 miles verdict : @entity1 values him as a stable presence on and off the pitch			1
plenty in the tank after an in - out season and will play at times to ease strain on @entity173			0
still got it : @entity204 should be fresh after playing less games for @entity84 this season @entity309 age : 28 club : @entity146 caps / goals : 89/38 tournaments : @entity181 , 2006 @entity7 , 2010 @entity7 , @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 190.4 miles verdict : for once , there are no injury worries going into a major tournament			2
@entity6 are less dependent on him now but he remains a vital part of the team			2
@entity323 age : 32 club : @entity118 caps / goals : 4/2 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 197 miles verdict : a popular member of the squad , at 32 he gets his reward for the journey through the backwaters of football			0
has never missed a penalty , so look out for him warming up in readiness for a 119th minute substitution			0
rise : @entity323 has gone from working in a factory to the brink of @entity6 's @entity7 squad @entity345 age : 24 club : @entity69 cap / goals : 10/3 tournaments : none distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 142.1 miles verdict : one of the reasons for renewed optimism in @entity6 ; a natural goalscorer with genuine pace who has flourished at @entity69 under @entity357			1
@entity358 age : 23 club : @entity146 caps / goals : 21/8 tournaments : @entity22 distance covered in 2013 - 14 : 101.9 miles verdict : distrusted by @entity365 but his ability to track back when wide left , as well as add speed and technical ability to counter attacks means he will play — and maybe even start against @entity370			0
versatile : @entity1 is a fan of @entity358 's ability to play out wide and through the middle lead your own @entity6 team to glory in @entity376 @entity377 , out now on @entity378 and @entity379 .			1

@entity223 and @entity236 are both set to be **included** in @entity6 's @entity7 squad
@entity1 may pick @entity115 over @entity138
@entity45 looks set to beat @entity53 to a place on the plane
@entity205 and @entity252 will be **included** if they prove their *fitness*
