@entity0 has told the new regime at the @entity2 that they must prioritise finding a way to lure @entity4 back to this side of the @entity6 , even if it means competition organisers spending more on appearance fees			1
the absence of @entity4 is a leading discussion point in @entity11 this week , with the @entity12 choosing not to contest the penultimate event of the @entity15 calendar			1
his lead of close to three million points in the race to @entity19 is so great that one of @entity22 ’s @entity21 , @entity23 or @entity24 could win both here at the @entity25 and the season - finale in @entity19 next week and still not catch him if he finishes top five in the desert			1
@entity4 will not compete in @entity11 this week as his lead in the race to @entity19 is so big that prospect is so unlikely that @entity0 would like to see the @entity2 – on which he will contest his 600th event in @entity11 – consider introducing points - heavy finale to the season , as they do in the @entity39 ’s @entity38 series			1
he also believes that the wider issue of bringing @entity4 to @entity15 more during the season should be high on the agenda for the next @entity2 chief executive after @entity44 steps down			1
asked if he thought financial incentives would be a good idea , @entity0 said : ‘ very good			2
i think the new ceo of our tour has to be very careful about our stars , our @entity52 players , the stars of our tour , playing full time somewhere else			1
@entity0 says the @entity2 must ‘ we 've got to be quite careful here			2
the first thing a sponsor asks is “ who 's playing ? ” and too many times , too often , nine or 10 of our @entity60 are playing full time in @entity62 , and we have to address that			1
the new ceo of the @entity2 has to address that and @entity4 is part of that			2
‘ we have to have more of our stars playing more in @entity15 more of the time			1
that 's a big , big first job of the ceo to try and address that situation			0
how , i do n't know how that 's done , because i 'm not of the job			0
both @entity23 and @entity21 will compete at the @entity25 this week ‘ there 's too many of our stars playing in @entity62 and not enough @entity62 stars playing over here			1
that would be no 1 ( priority )			0
’ @entity0 tees up at the @entity25 on thursday after a stunning year on the @entity79 , in which he won two majors			2
he returns to competition against what he terms ‘ the flat bellies ’ with the claim that his form this season reached the levels of his @entity89 prime			0
the 51 - year - old said : ‘ i believe i 've played as well as i did , or almost as well as i did , in the @entity91			0
i really have performed as well as i would like to have done			0
‘ i think i 'm enjoying the game more than i did			0
i do n't know if i enjoyed the game ( earlier in his career )			0
it was more of a job			0
now i 'm actually enjoying the game			0

@entity4 has *decided* not to compete in the @entity25
the @entity12 leads the race to @entity19 by almost three million points
@entity0 is worried that too many of the top @entity15 are playing full time in @entity62
