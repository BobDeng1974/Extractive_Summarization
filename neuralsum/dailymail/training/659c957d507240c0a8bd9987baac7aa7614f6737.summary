given the global attention - and the challenge of making a mainstream blockbuster out of a kinky novel - it is just as well that director @entity5 has great reserves of courage			1
having faced colon cancer when her daughter was an infant , and breast cancer three years later , she is not easily spooked			0
‘ surviving cancer does give you a remarkable perspective on life , ’ she ’s said			1
' you take no * * * * , take no prisoners , and just do what feels right			0
’ left to right : author , @entity20 , actress @entity21 and director @entity5 at the @entity22 in february 2015 and now , it seems , what ‘ feels right ’ is to walk away from the @entity26 film - and away from its author @entity20 , with whom she has a ‘ toxic ’ relationship			1
although she was hired to direct the film with the approval of @entity34 - real name @entity20 - it is no secret that the two clashed exhaustingly while bringing the mega-bestselling book to the screen			1
they are now said to ‘ despise ’ each other to such an extent that the director filming the sequels is out of the question			1
rather extraordinarily , @entity20 attempted to exert control over every aspect of the movie , turning up on set every day to watch filming , rejecting rewrites and trying to keep in as much of the sex as possible			1
@entity5 saw the film as a ‘ dark fairytale ’ and @entity20 viewed it as an erotic epic			1
in an interview , @entity5 conceded : ‘ it was difficult , i ’m not going to lie			1
we would have proper on - set barneys and i ’m not confrontational			2
’ the two women even clashed over the final word in the film , with @entity5 favouring ‘ red ’ , a ‘ safe word ’ used in the bedroom by the protagonists to tell the other person they have gone too far , and @entity20 insisting on ‘ stop ’			1
@entity5 and her husband @entity66 are pictured here at the @entity69 film premiere of @entity26 in @entity70 , @entity71 and so even though she was thought to be in line to direct the two planned sequels to fifty shades , and even though the film has defied its critics and proved very successful at the box office , it seems @entity5 will play no further part in the story of @entity26 and @entity26			1
however , when the dust settles on this outbreak of hostilities surely we will weigh the story of @entity5 , 47 , as more fascinating than anything created by @entity20			1
for the woman born as plain @entity5 , raised in sleepy @entity87 in @entity88 , has had a life which far outshines the plodding boy - meets - girl plot of @entity26			1
her current triumphs — she is beautiful , wealthy , successful and adored by her husband — come after a series of devastating emotional setbacks			0
her story begins in 1967 in @entity97 , @entity71 , where @entity5 and her younger sister @entity98 lived with their parents @entity100 and @entity103			1
@entity20 ( pictured ) who wrote the best selling trilogy was apparently keen to include more sex in the film when she was nine , her father , an accountant — for a chapter of the @entity110 bikers , no less — left to bike around the world and never came back			1
her mother moved to @entity88 to what @entity5 describes as a commune , and started to teach yoga and astrology			1
in @entity5 ’s words : ‘ it started as a fairly ordinary middle - class existence , then i moved into a chaotic hippie world			1
’ she recalled once asking her mother what religion they were , to which @entity100 replied ‘ @entity125 ’			1
‘ i remember thinking , “ what the f * * * does that mean ? ” she taught yoga at my school , which was highly embarrassing			2
’ @entity5 married @entity132 ( pictured ) in 1997 and they have two daughters together @entity100 remarried but , when @entity5 was 15 , handed her a note to give to her stepfather — saying she was leaving — and walked out , too			1
@entity5 said in 2010 : ‘ my mum has lived in @entity139 for 22 years , and we have a rocky relationship			1
but at the same time it ’s one i want to maintain			0
’ after the split , @entity5 lived with her stepfather , learning self - sufficiency without either parent around			1
at school , she felt ‘ a total thickie ’ , and scraped through with five @entity148			1
she believes she was suffering from undiagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , which made it impossible for her to concentrate in lessons			2
‘ i still find it hard to focus on any singular thing , ’ she said			1
‘ it ’s why making a film suits me : you always have to answer a million questions			2
’ however , she re-sat her exams and managed to scrape into @entity160			2
from there she was accepted to @entity71 ’s @entity162 — studying alongside other future stars of the @entity165 scene , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
she dated @entity169 , later famous for the artworks he makes in partnership with his elder brother , @entity172			0
while @entity5 was at @entity71 ’s @entity162 she studied alongside stars of the @entity165 scene such as @entity166 ( pictured ) after graduating in 1990 , she worked as a dresser at the @entity175 and as a manager at a nightclub , but continued to make art. it was her video installation @entity179 — showing four people lip - synching to opera — which brought her to the attention of debonair @entity132 , the @entity184 son of @entity186 politician @entity185			2
he found her work ‘ immensely moving ’ and invited her to stage a show at his gallery , @entity189			2
he became @entity5 ’s art dealer , and they married in 1997			2
the girl who used to queue up for free school dinners now lived in a house off @entity196 with a man worth around £ 100 million			0
‘ my life radically altered , ’ she said			2
‘ i had found someone who could provide me with total stability , and i ’d not really had that			2
’ while @entity5 and @entity132 were married they were part of a glittering social scene that included the likes of @entity206 ( pictured ) their happiness was sealed by the birth of daughter @entity210 , but eight months later , in 1997 , @entity5 was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery			1
she recalled : ‘ i ’d look at @entity210 and say , “ there ’s no option here			2
i ’ve got to fight through it			0
” ’ by this point she and @entity132 were at the epicentre of a glittering if louche social scene , which included supermodel @entity206 and the late designer @entity221			0
her lifestyle , @entity5 said , was ‘ drips by day , @entity224 by night ’			1
the cancer , though , appeared to be beaten			0
nearly three years later , when she was only 32 , there was grim news : she discovered a lump in her breast			0
she had a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery in @entity233 , arranged by her close friend sir @entity234			0
@entity5 's mastectomy and reconstructive surgery was arranged by her close friend sir @entity234 ( pictured ) doctors recommended she take the drug @entity239 but she refused , instead giving up dairy products and almost all alcohol , and focusing on having a calmer life instead			1
‘ i had been punishing my immune system			0
i was trying to live hard like all of my friends , and i realised that i ca n’t			0
’ despite misgivings from her doctors , she remained cancer - free			0
some of the party crowd drifted away ; she had changed			0
she has spoken of the ‘ core of steel ’ she developed to deal with the disease			2
‘ when you ’re no longer ill , that core of steel does n’t go away , and then i had to find other channels for it			0
’ @entity5 ( left ) fell for @entity66 ( right ) on the set of @entity257 when she made her directorial debut and he was playing the role of a young @entity260 her art became ever more successful			1
she produced an unusual portrait of @entity263 — an hour - long video of him sleeping — for the @entity265			0
in @entity266 , she took photographs of 28 famous actors weeping			0
in 2006 , after five cancer - free years , she and @entity132 welcomed a second daughter , @entity270			0
the marriage , though , was over two years later			0
@entity5 fell for a partner even younger — @entity66 , the young actor from @entity273 playing @entity260 in @entity257 , her debut film as a director			1
she ’d been shown the script by a friend and ‘ stalked the producers ’ to get the job			2
at the time they started dating , @entity66 was 19 , 24 years her junior			0
they announced plans to marry at the film ’s premiere , but had two daughters , @entity288 and @entity289 , before the wedding			0
@entity5 and @entity66 now have two of their own daughters , @entity288 and @entity294 , as well as @entity5 's daughters from her marriage to @entity297 , @entity210 and @entity270 the besotted groom opted to take his wife ’s name — so they are now both @entity5			1
he has gladly spent extended periods as a househusband			0
now they have a £ 13 million house ( bought for cash ) in @entity307 , @entity308 , and another place in @entity310 , and spent most of last year filming @entity26 in @entity311			0
the family of four girls and two dogs goes everywhere with her			0
‘ my girls have the best woman to look up to , ’ @entity66 said last year			2
‘ she ’s the strongest woman i know			0
’ just do n’t mention that age difference			0
‘ the amount of men i know with the same age gap that we have — how come no one says anything about that ? ’ @entity5 has said			1
‘ i try to ignore it			0
in my life , i ’ve never really listened when people start forming opinions on how you should be doing things			0

the *popular* film 's director says she is ' not confrontational '
no secret was made of the *disagreements* between author and director
@entity5 saw the film as a ‘ dark fairy tale ’ and @entity20 viewed it as an erotic epic
they are now said to ‘ despise ’ each other
