@entity0 has reason to be thankful			1
if @entity2 had not spent more than Â£ 150m on new firepower during the summer , he 'd be getting slaughtered for his performances right now			2
the @entity5 has largely managed to stay under the radar in the opening two months of the campaign despite a series of anonymous , lacklustre displays that perhaps signal the start of a terminal decline			1
inevitably the scrutiny has been on the likes of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , the latest batch of expensive acquisitions , rather than those who were already at @entity21			0
@entity37 barely turned up in @entity2 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity39 on monday night and fans and pundits alike are starting to notice			1
deployed as the spearhead of @entity2 's attack at @entity44 in the absence of the suspended @entity46 and the jet - lagged @entity16 , a sluggish @entity37 took 75 minutes to make an eye - catching contribution			1
with instinctive control on the periphery of the box , he unleashed a volley that smacked the base of the post , coming within millimetres of a @entity2 equaliser			2
it was the one glimpse of his best all night			0
in the end , it required @entity37 's compatriot @entity61 to rescue the team late on and keep the gap to @entity65 leaders @entity66 down to a mere 10 points			1
for the rest of the match , @entity37 was a shadow of his former self			0
absent - minded and ineffective , he roamed around without ever looking like scoring			0
it required a goal from @entity61 three minutes from the end to rescue @entity2 at the @entity44 @entity37 , who captained @entity2 , celebrates with @entity76 after the @entity78 's second - half goal @entity2 looked better once @entity16 was introduced during the second half goals up to october 21st for club and country 2012 - 2013 8 for @entity2 , 2 for @entity83 final season total : 35 2013 - 2014 7 for @entity2 , 6 for @entity83 final season total : 28 2014 - 2015 2 for @entity2 , 1 for @entity83 it was a final indignity when @entity16 , who had arrived back at @entity86 two days later than @entity37 having clocked up several thousand more air miles , looked sharper than the @entity5 when he came on			1
@entity89 pundit and @entity91 columnist @entity88 tweeted that @entity37 , 31 , has not been himself for 12 months now and had a point			2
on this form , @entity37 , who has just two goals for @entity2 so far this season , will lose his place leading @entity2 's line when @entity46 returns and @entity16 fully recovers			1
comparing this point in time over the last couple of seasons and we see the beginnings of decline			0
two years ago to the day , @entity37 scored in a 4 - 2 home win over @entity106			1
it was his eighth goal in a @entity2 shirt since joining sir @entity110 's side from @entity111			1
at this stage last season , he already had seven for @entity2 and a further six for his country			0
this season 's return so far has been meagre by comparison and @entity37 is injury - free			1
@entity89 pundit and @entity91 columnist @entity88 summed up the thoughts of many fans @entity37 prepares to re-start the game after one of @entity24 's goals at the @entity44 @entity37 celebrates his goal against @entity124 , one of two he has scored for @entity2 this season @entity37 's heat map from monday 's match shows most of his touches came too deep to make an impact passes : 24 passing accuracy : 79.2 % duels won : 2 duels lost : 2 shots on target : 1 shots off target : 2 chances created : 1 and his all - round influence is fading too			1
against @entity24 , @entity37 made just 24 passes , had just one shot on target and set - up just one chance for someone else			1
in all , @entity2 had 22 shots on the @entity24 goal			1
his heat map from the evening shows his principal contributions came on the halfway line rather than in the penalty box			0
it was a shock to discover that he covered 10.93km during the game , second only to blind and @entity154			0
it seems most of that running was into the wrong areas			0
and it is certainly not the first time this season he has looked invisible in games and it was made worse by the fact he was captain for the night			0
when it was announced that @entity165 was to succeed @entity166 at @entity21 before the @entity167 , the link - up with @entity37 seemed a match made in heaven			2
@entity0 had been heart - broken when @entity110 decided to retire in 2013 but this was going to make up for it			2
@entity165 had taken the player under his wing long ago - his captain for the national team , they enjoyed an almost father - son bond and even went on scouting trips together			0
just look at the joy on @entity165 's face as @entity37 raced towards him for a high - five following that sensational diving header against @entity183 at the @entity167 , the trigger for a 5 - 1 rout			1
@entity37 scored for @entity83 against @entity183 at the @entity167 with a sensational diving header and the striker rushed straight to @entity22 for a high - five after scoring @entity37 's free - scoring exploits for @entity2 appear to be on the wane the @entity5 striker was bitterly disappointed when sir @entity110 decided to retire in 2013 those scenes were going to be repeated every week on the @entity21 touchline			1
perhaps the pressures of a long run in the @entity167 are still affecting @entity37 - though he had a very long rest afterwards - or perhaps there is another niggle affecting those ageing legs			2
maybe he is still reeling from being second choice to @entity46 last season under @entity201 , or from @entity165 's decision to give the captain 's armband to his strike partner			0
the arrival of @entity16 has maybe knocked his nose out of joint			0
whatever the reason or reasons , @entity37 needs to show an urgent improvement in his game			0
@entity2 have a difficult run of fixtures now in which they play @entity66 , @entity216 and @entity111 in their next four matches			0
@entity165 still believes @entity2 can make up the 10 - point gap to leaders @entity66 and win the title			2
to have a sniff of a chance , he needs his favourite son to start performing straight away .			0

@entity0 was anonymous in @entity2 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity24
@entity83 striker hit the post but did little else at the @entity44
the ' jet - lagged ' @entity16 looked sharper when he came on
@entity37 's performance was criticised by fans and pundits alike
many believe 31 - year - old is in terminal decline , as goal record *suggests*
