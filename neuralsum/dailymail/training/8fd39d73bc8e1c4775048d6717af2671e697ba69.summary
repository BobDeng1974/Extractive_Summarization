' dr @entity77 fired back , saying that the real people who are demonising the @entity3 community are the likes of @entity9 militants @entity111 and @entity113 , who are fighting in the @entity114			1
' i reckon the one who is demonising our community is the @entity9 fighting overseas and parading severed heads on @entity6			1
