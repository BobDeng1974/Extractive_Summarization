by @entity0 for @entity1 a gang of @entity4 fraudsters have been jailed for between 21 and 64 months for stealing an estimated £ 16 million - worth of bank card details from more than 60,000 people in the @entity7 and abroad			1
three men and a woman appeared at the @entity10 for sentencing after pleading guilty to a string of fraud offences after police uncovered what they described as a ' fraudster 's utopia ' in @entity17 , @entity18			2
prosecutor @entity19 said the defendants - who were living at addresses in the area - were responsible for ' a large - scale , highly sophisticated , well executed @entity24 and counterfeit fraud '			0
facing jail : @entity27 , 30 , @entity28 , 30 , @entity29 , 27 and @entity30 , 25 , ( top left to bottom right ) ran a gang who targeted more than 60,000 bank customers in a £ 16million fraud the criminal operation was smashed in december last year when police seized an array of gadgets including cards traps , cloned cards and spy cameras in raids			1
the gang were involved in three stages of fraud - scamming bank card data from @entity24 , downloading it on to a computer and then copying the details on to counterfeit plastic cards , ms @entity19 said			0
in all , 953 bank accounts had been compromised and a total of £ 161,607.47 was taken , although the potential loss was far greater , she said			0
money was then transferred abroad to @entity57 , @entity4 , @entity58 and @entity59 using @entity60 and @entity61 , the court was told			2
the prosecutor said @entity63 and @entity64 were the key players in the conspiracy , and @entity29 and his partner @entity67 had lesser roles			2
they all pleaded guilty at earlier hearings to conspiracy to defraud between january 1 2012 and december 11 2013 and various other related offences			0
@entity27 was jailed for 64 months , @entity28 was handed 61 months , @entity30 was jailed for 21 months and @entity29 was jailed for 43 months			1
jailing them , recorder @entity73 said : ' electronic card fraud is one of the scourges of the technological age both nationally and internationally			0
' it causes significant loss to the banks and distress and inconvenience to the card holders whose cards have been compromised			0
' @entity27 , 30 , of @entity17 , also admitted possessing criminal property relating to bank details , making a scanning device and possession of an identity document with improper intention			1
sophisticated fraud : by placing cameras and skimming equipment on cashpoints they managed to get hold of the details of more than 60,000 bank customers and cloned cards with a value of £ 16m @entity29 , 25 , of @entity17 , pleaded guilty to having bank details on a computer , having counterfeit plastic cards , atm card slots and a fake photo identity card			1
@entity30 , 27 , pleaded guilty to having bank account details on a computer and two counts relating to the transfer or acquisition of money			1
@entity28 , 30 , pleaded guilty to two counts of the transfer or acquisition of money			1
following the sentencing , police said of more than 60,000 card details found , 36,000 of them belonged to people in the @entity7			2
many of the cards found had the number of the stolen pin written in black marker pen on the back for easy use by the criminals , a spokesman for the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) said			1
the cards recovered had a street value of £ 16 million - based on the amount stolen on average from a compromised card , they said			2
as officers investigated this case , evidence of a method never seen before in the @entity7 to steal card details came to light - spy cameras fitted to the side panel of cash machines , rather than the top panel			1
this method allowed fraudsters a better view of people 's pin numbers when the keypad is only partially covered by the customer 's hand			1
detective inspector @entity155 , who led the investigation for the @entity124 , said : ' we are delighted that with these arrests and convictions we have been able to completely dismantle a criminal organisation that was stealing millions from people 's bank accounts			0
' the premises we raided really were a fraudster 's utopia , with a dizzying array of machines and gadgets designed to commit serious fraud			0
' these convictions send out a strong message to would - be fraudsters but there is also a word of caution for customers - always cover your pin closely with your hand when using a cash machine to beat the criminals '			2
@entity182 , director of the organised crime department at the @entity4 national police , added : ' close co-operation between the @entity124 and our own officers played a key part in successfully securing these convictions			0
' it was an excellent example of law enforcement agencies from different countries working together to ensure fraudsters ' activities are brought to a halt and their crimes are punished			0
' since the @entity124 was set up in april 2002 , it has saved around £ 450 million by clamping down on fraud activity .			0

fraudsters ran ' factory ' where they cloned cards using stolen pin numbers
@entity4 attached cameras and ' skimmers ' to cashpoints across @entity7
@entity27 , 30 , @entity28 , 30 , @entity29 , 27 and @entity30 , 25 will be sentenced at the @entity10 *tomorrow*
