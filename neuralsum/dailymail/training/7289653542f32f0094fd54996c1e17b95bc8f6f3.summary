@entity0 has officially switched over to the competition as he made his first appearance on longtime morning show rival , the @entity4			1
the former @entity6 weatherman left the @entity8 morning show to become the managing editor of @entity10 where he will anchor his own three - hour show			1
since @entity10 is owned by @entity12 , he went on @entity4 briefly thursday morning to tease his new show where he was welcomed with open arms and stories of his longtime friendship with @entity17			1
the @entity4 crew were clearly trying to mimic it with @entity25 's appearance this morning			2
the show 's @entity38 feed was quick to publicize the visit , posting a picture of the smiling anchors on set			0
warm front moving in : champion is now running his own three - hour morning show on @entity10 which is owned by @entity47 as is @entity4 excited : @entity25 said that the goal is to have more people watch @entity10 for longer as opposed to their regular consumption habits of tuning in quickly and leaving longtime pals : @entity25 said that @entity17 was his first friend when he moved to @entity53 25 years ago the segment only lasted less than three minutes , but @entity25 used it as a way to show his longtime ties to the network through @entity17 and his plans for the yet - untitled @entity10 morning show			1
' this is awesome because everyone watches the @entity10 in the morning - they dip in and they dip out , ' @entity25 explained			1
' we 're going to present a really good , focused weather cast with a lot of live events and a lot of pictures from all over the planet of what 's going on in the weather that morning			0
we want people - you know , folks who are interested in the weather - we want them to get that full compliment in the morning			0
' still close : he clearly is n't forgetting his @entity8 pals as he posted this picture with @entity79 just two days ago while no logistical details about the show have been announced , it is extremely unlikely that @entity17 will be leaving his work on @entity4 to be alongside @entity25 , but the fact that they are both under the same parent corporation appears to have come as a welcome fact to the @entity8 transplant			2
' we 've known each other for 25 years and this is the first chance we 've had to actually work together , ' @entity25 said of @entity17 this morning			0
' do you know when i got to @entity53 and started local news - my very first live shot , i do n't know if you remember this - but it was a circus was in town			0
you were the first person and my first friend in @entity53 because when i moved here , i did n't know anyone , and @entity17 came up and we made friends during that live shot			0

@entity0 has made his first appearance on an @entity12 show after working for rival network @entity8 for years
he left @entity6 to *launch* his own three - hour morning program on @entity10 , which is owned by @entity12
