this is the @entity1 aircraft that @entity2 hopes will thrust it right into the space race			1
constructed amidst the rubble of his mother 's backyard , ambitious @entity5 believes the @entity9 will lead to his continent launching its first astronaut into orbit			1
the @entity14 founder has been helped by 600 volunteers in partially achieving the first stage of his dream - the creation of the plane that will penetrate the edge of space by flying at 80,000ft			1
he firmly believes it will launch in the next ' four to six years '			1
but given the condition of his project at the moment , he might be advised to buy a gigantic rubber band to help it on its way			0
the former astronomy student said : ' it is n't about money , it is n't about competition or pride			0
' the mission is about advancement in space technology as a continent and what we can contribute towards that growth			1
' we are trying to have @entity2 participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind 's destiny			0
' the cynical may question how @entity59 can launch his own space programme without any money , and be entirely reliant on donations			1
is he mad ? @entity5 's mother , @entity63 , watches as the @entity2 skyhawk is constructed in her backyard the former astronomy student said : ' we are trying to have @entity2 participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind 's destiny			0
' @entity71 leans against the wing of the @entity9			1
he is confident the @entity9 's test flight will take place next year , and he will have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in ' four to six years '			1
they may also ask how it can be achieved , seeing as @entity1 has no history of space exploration and he is teaching the aspiring astronauts himself			2
but he said he was confident the @entity9 's test flight would take place next year , and he would have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in ' four to six years '			1
he added : ' this is not a one - man mission			0
we work jointly to achieve goals			0
' i have trained my crew ( in ) advanced astronomy			0
they are very good at astronomy in regards to calculations and identifications of various space objects			2
' and when asked how he plans to simulate zero gravity for training , he said it would be ' easy '			2
he added : ' i 've got a jet engine on order so i 'm planning to build a tunnel , put the engine at one end and when i throw a guy in he 'll float in a similar way to how he would in space			2
' @entity5 , who admits that ' one time or another every successful scientists has been called a madman ' has been toiling away in his mother 's backyard , in the @entity115 suburb of @entity116 , for three years			2
but despite the challenges he faces , he said was confident his space shuttle , dubbed @entity119 , would be ready sooner rather than later			1
and he cited funding from foreigners , and the promise of cash from the @entity1 government , as markers to their ongoing success			0
he said : ' it will first operate in @entity129 's lower orbit then advance with time			0
we might not have money in our system but we do get our homework done			0

@entity9 will soar to 80,000ft sometime in 2012
plans for space shuttle launch in next four years
