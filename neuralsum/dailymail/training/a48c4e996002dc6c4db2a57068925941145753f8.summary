published : 18:00 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 13:32 est , 13 march 2014 when you ’ve had ‘ one of those days ’ , nothing beats a plate of stodge for momentary — if sinful — release from it all			1
the other day , when i met my friend @entity9 for lunch , work and children had pushed me to hair - tearing point — but i knew it could all be solved by one of those giant toasties with rivers of melted cheddar oozing from hunks of white bread			1
so why then , did i find myself ordering an abstemious tuna salad instead ? i ’m certainly not worried about my figure — i ’m a very trim size ten — i just feel bad for @entity9 , who , at a size 16/18 , constantly battles the proverbial bulge			1
@entity26 ( left ) feels bad about ordering fatty food around her size 16/18 friend , @entity9 ( right ) it would be unfair to sit there , knee - deep in calories , when she tries to watch what she eats			1
talk about rubbing her face in the fact i can eat whatever i want			1
not that this kind of abstinence is n’t frustrating			0
sometimes i feel like shouting : ‘ so you ’re overweight — that ’s your problem , not mine ! ’ this is the harsh truth about being a skinny minnie with fat friends			1
you are forever tiptoeing around the elephant in the room — their weight			1
it may sound callous , but when your pals are podgy they cast a giant shadow over your every move when you ’re with them			1
of course there will be many on the other side of the fence who say their plight is far worse : having to watch as stick insects around them devour chocolates and then slither into slinky dresses			0
there may even be some who wonder if i do n’t protest too much			0
surely , there ’s a tiny part of me that enjoys the fact that flabby friends inevitably emphasise your own svelte figure ? i can assure you i never feel this way			1
true friendship is a precious thing and i would never regard my mates as strategically positioned foils to shine a light on myself			0
although i know there are those who do : apparently one in three @entity81 women recently admitted they would choose a heavier friend as their bridesmaid to make them look comparatively trimmer on their wedding day			0
as for me , thanks to a fast metabolism , genetic good fortune and a love of brisk walking and swimming , i rarely put on weight			0
in fact , at nine - and - a - half stone , i am lighter than i was when i got married 23 years ago			0
that ’s not to say there have n’t been times when a few pounds have crept up on me , such as after over-indulging on holiday			1
but i just under - indulge when i get back and make sure i exercise			0
of course i know it ’s not so simple for some			1
many have a compulsive relationship with food and i feel for them , i really do			0
that ’s not to say my gut reaction is n’t to judge when i see a porky stranger tucking into a cheeseburger and chips on the train			2
it ’s hard to resist the urge to go over and say : ‘ why are you doing this to yourself ? ’ ' although @entity9 ( right ) appreciated my attempts at sensitivity , it upset her more to think that i could n’t be myself around her " says @entity26 ( left ) of course it ’s different with friends : judgment is replaced by concern , fear of saying the wrong thing			1
a few weeks ago , i met a fairly portly work friend after a half - term trip to @entity124			0
we shared anecdotes about my holiday but just as i was about to marvel that my jeans felt slightly tight , i bit my tongue			0
how could i share this with a woman who has n’t been inside a pair of denims since the turn of the millennium ? instead i quickly changed the subject because having friends who are overweight , makes you feel relentlessly self - conscious			1
i ’m certainly not the only one who feels like this			2
in fact there is a collective paranoia about causing offence to those larger than ourselves			1
take the fact teachers and health professionals are forbidden from broaching a dangerously obese child ’s size head on : ‘ obese ’ is a banned term , as is ‘ fat ’			1
no wonder the rest of us feel like we ’re treading on eggshells			2
sometimes , my discomfort around my bigger friends is cringe - worthy : take the time @entity9 spotted me wearing a figure - hugging dress at a wedding and swamped me with compliments			2
my response ? instead of revelling in her kind words , i did what i always do : i either deflect ( ‘ my shoes are absolutely killing me ! ’ ) or attempt humour ( ‘ you think i look slim ? forget it			1
look at her : i ’ve seen pipe cleaners with more meat			0
i ca n’t just enjoy a nice comment ; i have to bat it away so as not to make the friend feel bad about herself			2
up to 64 per cent of @entity81 adults are classed as being overweight or obese and when it comes to paying them a genuine compliment you ’re really in a sticky situation			1
@entity9 always looks super smart and can put together flattering outfits with panache — ie she knows how to emphasise her pretty face and detract from her figure			2
the other week i heard someone say to her : ‘ you always know how to dress			2
’ the unspoken part of the sentence being ‘ for your size ’			1
most of the time , i just try not to talk about fashion in front of anyone who is manifestly big			2
and if the conversation drifts towards new trends , i ’ll do my best to change the subject — perhaps asking for recipe ideas — so that we can talk about something that is less sensitive and more interesting for them			2
even worse , though , are the shopping trips with oversized pals			0
recently , i arranged a day out with an old school friend i had n’t seen in years			0
i was going to a 40th birthday party that weekend so she said she would help me pick something glam to wear			0
but it turned out she ’d gained at least a stone - and - a - half			0
so i did n’t have the gall to try anything on in front of her , instead veering towards the kaftan section , saying i wanted one for my summer holiday			2
i ’m ashamed to confess that i made a mental note never to go shopping with her — or anyone over a size 10 — again			2
so what does @entity9 make of all this ? she ’s tried every diet under the sun including having a gastric band fitted			2
sadly , it did n’t work			0
although she had to avoid heavy meals , it did n’t address her mindset — her sweet tooth — and so she still manages to eat the hot chocolates and ice cream			1
sometimes @entity26 ( pictured ) feels like shouting : ' so you 're overweight - that 's your problem , not mine ! ' despite all this , she has never shown a sliver of jealousy that i am thinner than her			1
perhaps it serves me right that when she sat down to lunch with me the other day , she picked up on the real reason for my choice of a tuna salad			0
she wrested the fork from my hand and declared : ‘ @entity26 , for goodness sake , just order what you want			1
i know what you ’re up to and it does n’t help			2
’ then it all came tumbling out			0
although @entity9 appreciated my attempts at sensitivity , it upset her more to think that i could n’t be myself around her			0
what ’s more , she felt patronised and belittled when thin friends went to great lengths to avoid anything that acknowledged a disparity between our waistlines			1
she pointed out that now she was a mother - of - three and a grandmother - of - four , she was big enough — no pun intended — to cope with the fact that she had friends who were thinner			1
she also reminded me that she has experienced many highs and lows and reached a point in her life where she could cope with just about anything			0
‘ anyway , ’ she added , ‘ even if you do eat that pathetic salad , and continue to avoid shopping with me , it wo n’t make me any thinner			1
so stop pussy - footing around			0
’ i was dumbfounded and felt a rush of scarlet shame			0
i had been a flaky do - gooder who , compelled by a misguided niceness , had given little thought to the transparency of my actions			0
the only words i could find were : ‘ i ’m so , so sorry			0
’ right then and there i vowed never again to edit my behaviour around my hugely wise , big - hearted and , yes , overweight friends			1
and when @entity9 summoned the waitress and ordered a cream cake that afternoon , i put my hand on her arm and said : ‘ you ’d better make that two			0

@entity26 often feels like she ca *n't* eat what she wants in front of fat friends
wants to shout ‘ so you ’re overweight — that ’s your problem , not mine ! ’
says is collective paranoia about offending those larger than ourselves
