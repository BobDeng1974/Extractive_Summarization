smitten or bitten ? while they may be beautiful , some larger species of tarantula have large fangs capable of administering an unpleasant bite ( pictured ) even if their venom is not lethal to humans the heat is on : the spider competitors were in with a chance of winning a number of categories ( pictured )			2
one spider breeder called @entity97 said that a freshly moulted adult stands the best chance of winning as its colours are at its brightest the model specimen : as well as posing and having perfect markings , the spider 's ' abdomen should n't show signs of overfeeding but be lean and rounded , ' one expert said tarantulas are part of a group of very large arachnids that are often hairy , which belong to the @entity125 family of spiders			1
approximately 900 species have been identified			0
like all arthropods , tarantulas are invertebrates that rely on their exoskeleton for muscular support			0
they can be as small as a fingernail to as large as a dinner plate with legs spans of up to 12inches ( 30cm )			0
the goliath birdeater ( @entity137 ) from @entity138 and @entity139 is the largest variety			0
tarantulas can be found in western states in the @entity144 central and @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and in @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 in @entity153			0
they have eight legs and two double - segment chelicerae that house the fangs which are located just below their eyes , near their mouth			0
they also contain the venom glands for the fangs , which are used to bite in defence and chew			0
a tarantula perceives its surroundings primarily via sensory organs called setae ( hairs or spines )			2
although a tarantula has eyes , touch is its keenest sense , and in hunting it primarily depends on vibrations given off by the movements of its prey			2
however , they are also prey themselves and animals including the giant centipedes			0
he won @entity183 at the competition and said : ‘ the abdomen should n't show signs of overfeeding but be lean and rounded			2
’ unlike @entity188 , where winning pedigree dogs and their offspring can fetch thousands of pounds , winning the tarantula contest does not make owners rich			1
mr @entity97 said : ‘ the value is in kudos , respect and pleasure in showing off a certain species in its prime			0
’ people fly in from the @entity144 and @entity201 to compete in the contest , which has grown from its old home in a village hall to the conference centre			0
the spider enthusiasts claim that the @entity125 family of tarantulas make great pets as they are clean and communicative , carry no diseases and can live for up to 30 years			1
they do n’t need much space ages and are happy in an aquarium as in the wild they stick close to their burrows			0
the creatures come in an array of markings and colours from the winning @entity17 , which has iridescent blue legs to the @entity223 with its pale pink hairs			1
however , while they may be beautiful , some larger species have large fangs capable of administering an unpleasant bite , even if their venom is not lethal to humans			0
they can also flick barbed body hairs at a would - be attacker , which is one of the reasons why the @entity235 advises against handling them too much			0
the creatures can easily die if they are dropped and anyone seen handling their pet at the show is immediately disqualified			2
precious : the spiders come in all shapes and sizes , but just because they win a category they do n't become immediately valuable			2
