by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 5:00 pm on 30th january 2012 he stepped out of prison this morning into the arms of his wife looking decidedly pale compared with her glowing wag - like looks			2
so it would be no surprise if disgraced former msp @entity8 dropped into the tanning salon to celebrate his early release after serving just over one year of his three - year sentence for lying under oath			1
the 47 - year - old walked out of @entity15 prison near @entity16 shortly after 10am with his wife , @entity17 , vowing to appeal his conviction			1
he was awarded £ 200,000 in damages after winning the civil case but a jury at the @entity41 in @entity23 found him guilty of lying about the now - defunct tabloid 's claims that he was an adulterer who visited a swingers ' club			1
during his trial it was alleged that he had sex with @entity49 , a @entity51 member , in his marital bed			2
it was also claimed that she was involved in a threesome with @entity8 and his brother - in - law			1
miss @entity49 said she had a fling with the @entity58 for several years , but he denies ever having slept with her			2
trial judge @entity59 subsequently handed the former leader of the @entity51 a three - year jail sentence , telling him his decision to pursue the sunday tabloid for defamation ' brought the walls of the temple crashing down ' on him			1
speaking outside his @entity23 home , @entity8 said he intends to launch a fresh appeal against his conviction , and fight for an independent @entity71			1
he also claimed the prospect of a ' gagging order ' against him was lifted earlier today			2
together , the @entity28 and their lawyer , @entity74 , told reporters they would try and get his conviction overturned @entity8 said : ' it is a relief to be able to speak personally for once			1
it seems a long time now since i have been able to speak			2
' it 's been an absolute delight to be back home with my beautiful wife who i love dearly , and my daughter @entity83 who i have missed beyond words are able to describe			2
' up until a couple of hours ago , i did n't know i was going to be able to speak			2
up until a couple of hours ago i was still gagged			0
' i was told two hours ago that that gag has now been lifted			0
unfortunately , although i am not to be gagged today , i will be tagged			2
' he added : ' i want to thank the thousands of ordinary folk across @entity71 and further afield who have taken time to write to me , send me cards and letters , contact me on @entity92 and to show their solidarity with me and my family throughout this difficult 12 months			0
' i would like to thank them for being so human and so warm and respecting the fact that although we lost a trial in december of last year , we will continue to fight to clear my name			1
@entity8 with his wife , @entity17 , as he left @entity102 today after serving just a third of his sentence for lying under oath @entity49 alleged that she had sex with @entity8 and his brother - in - law ' and we are determined to highlight the contrasts in treatment between the 20 - plus - i 've lost count of the number of - @entity37 former journalists who have been arrested			1
' i have not read of any of them who have had their homes raided over a mammoth nine - hour search , or their children traumatised in the interests of justice			0
' apparently they handed themselves in at the stations			0
well , i 've got news for them and for others : this fight is far from over			0
this story has not yet finished			0
i believe that i will return to @entity41 in the near future			0
' @entity8 claimed ' witnesses ' had lied during his perjury trial and said he would have ' a strong appeal that will hopefully lead to the quashing of my unfair , unsafe and unsound conviction '			1
he added : ' i have to also say , however , that in the 12 months i have been away , things have not got any better for ordinary working - class folk			0
wages have been cut , prices have increased and the @entity141 millionaire government wants to make ordinary folk pay for a crisis that was nothing to do with them			0
' i look forward to re-engaging in the battle for justice and against inequality and poverty , and i also look forward to engaging in the campaign to deliver @entity71 not just as an independent country but as an independent socialist country as well			0
' i thank once again all of those who have stuck by me , my family and my friends			0
but most of all , i thank my wife @entity17			0
' his lawyer , @entity74 , said the new appeal is related to the outcome of the police investigation into alleged perjury during @entity8 's trial			1
mr @entity74 said : ' @entity20 is delighted to be back at home with his family			0
he intends to make up for lost time as best he can			0
@entity8 and his wife were driven away from the prison after he was released ' i have been instructed to prepare a new appeal which will be related to the outcome of @entity172 's investigation into allegations of phone hacking and perjury at @entity20 's trial			1
' @entity20 was told before @entity177 by the @entity178 that on release he could not speak directly to the media			0
such a condition would have been a draconian attack on his right to free speech			0
' over the weekend we stated this would be illegal and challenged it in the courts			0
the authorities have come to their senses and a gagging order will not be imposed			0
' @entity8 will be tagged later today and under the terms of his release will have to stay at home between 7.15pm and 7.15am			1
before they returned to a party inside the house , @entity74 and mrs @entity21 shared an emotional kiss on their doorstep			0
@entity8 's trial was one of the longest of its kind in @entity71 legal history			1
he was convicted of five out of six allegations in a single charge of perjury , relating to his evidence during the civil action at the @entity211 in @entity212			0
during the three - month @entity41 trial , @entity8 claimed he was the victim of a ' vendetta ' by the police and a ' conspiracy ' involving the sunday newspaper and former colleagues within the @entity51			1
in august last year he was denied the chance to appeal against his conviction , following a ruling by senior judges			1
@entity27 where @entity8 served just over 12 months @entity8 - who previously served time as part of an anti-poll tax campaign and then over an @entity226 protest at @entity229 nuclear submarine base - maintained his innocence through the trial			1
he claimed he was the victim of a ' vendetta ' by the police and a ' conspiracy ' involving the @entity37 and colleagues within the @entity51 ( @entity51 )			1
november 2004 : @entity8 sues @entity37 after it publishes series of stories alleging adultery and visits to a swingers ' club			1
august 2006 : politician denies allegations in court and jury awards him £ 200,000 in damages against @entity244			0
october 2006 : his testimony seems to be blown apart after @entity37 publishes secretly - recorded videotape in which @entity8 admits having visited sex club			1
december 2007 : @entity8 arrested as he leaves @entity212 radio station and charged with perjury			1
february 2008 : @entity21 , who acted as supporting witness to her husband , also charged with perjury			0

december 17 : @entity21 acquitted			0
december 23 : @entity8 convicted of perjury			1
january 26 2011 : @entity8 jailed for three years			1
the former @entity51 leader said 16 former allies were lying as part of a ' political civil war ' when they told the @entity41 in @entity23 that he had admitted at a 2004 meeting having been to @entity263 's swingers ' club in @entity264			2
@entity8 , who conducted his own defence , called @entity266 to give evidence during the sensational trial			1
but the jury found him guilty of perjury during the 2006 civil defamation case and lying about having an affair with @entity51 member @entity49			1
in a 50 - minute plea before sentencing , @entity8 asked for a ' proportionate and reasonable ' sentence and referring to previous perjury cases , including those of former conservative mps @entity278 and @entity280 , said : ' this is not a murder trial			1
nobody has been killed and neither has an innocent person been imprisoned			0
' but the judge , @entity59 , while praising him as a ' hard - working ' politician , added : ' when perjury is established it must be dealt with seriously for the benefit of the court and the public			0
' you embarked on an action in the @entity211 knowing that , for it to be successful , you would be required to tell lies under affirmation			0
' you committed perjury and you were awarded a very large sum in damages			0
the only appropriate sentence is one of imprisonment			2
' any prisoner serving a sentence of less than four years is currently eligible for automatic early release at the halfway point in their jail term			2
@entity8 would therefore be entitled to be freed from prison after 18 months			1
defiant : @entity21 , pictured hear after her husband was found guilty , continued to be vocal saying he would return stronger and ready to fight however , under current provisions , it is possible for individuals to spend up to the last six months of their sentence on home detention curfew			2
this means they can be freed from prison to live at home but must wear an electronically monitored tag for the remainder of their sentence			2
at the weekend @entity8 's lawyer , @entity74 , said he had been told that prison authorities would try to ' gag ' him on his release			1
mr @entity74 promised to seek a judicial review if a public - speaking ban features in @entity8 's release conditions			2
speaking on saturday , mr @entity74 said : ' i was aware that this was being imposed			0
it 's unprecedented , absolutely draconian and denies my client the right to earn a living			0
