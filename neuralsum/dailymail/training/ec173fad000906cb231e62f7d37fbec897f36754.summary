@entity0 will sign a four - deal at @entity1 after being given permission by @entity4 owner @entity3 to hold talks with the south @entity7 club			1
with @entity0 set to leave @entity9 , we asked @entity10 from @entity12 's view to comment on his impending departure			1
upon arriving on @entity16 in 2010 , a conspicuous outsider , it was clear from the very beginning that the appointment of @entity0 would cause controversy among the ever - expectant @entity20 faithful			1
his managerial record up until that point had been underwhelming , and he had become just another face on the managerial carousel that spins between the dregs of the @entity27 and the top of @entity29			0
he was , one might say , an @entity30 or an @entity31 : a generic manager associated with little beyond actually just being a football manager			0
and when juxtaposed alongside his club ’s coaching predecessors of @entity36 , sir @entity37 and @entity38 , he appeared a less than ambitious choice			0
@entity4 boss @entity0 will sign a four - year deal at @entity1 the @entity4 fans wanted @entity0 out after a difficult start to the 2014 - 15 @entity27 campaign @entity4 supporters hold up a ' @entity0 is a muppet ' banner ahead of their team 's clash against @entity49 in april his appointment at @entity4 was without doubt a flattering anomaly on his cv , and though he had fashioned for himself an image of high self - regard , he had never actually done anything in his career that had warranted such a lofty appointment , a seat in charge at one of the country ’s biggest football clubs			1
and it did n’t take long for him to be branded ‘ @entity65 ’ , a symbol of the much - hated regime which had stagnated the growth of the club over the past seven years			2
it would be fair to say that opinion on @entity0 among @entity4 fans has been divided			1
to some ( a distinct minority ) , it would seem blasphemous to dare criticise the man who guided @entity4 to fifth in 2012 , while to others his record in the @entity78 and in the domestic cups remain unforgivable			1
@entity0 ’s integrity as both a football manager and a man forms the basis of the majority of pub punditry ( of which there is no shortage ) on the @entity89 and has done so ever since his appointment			2
as the nature of modern football decrees , the league must be treated as a priority - and yet , under @entity0 ’s guidance , @entity4 ’s league standings over the past four years have fallen some way short of expectation			1
from the outsider ’s perspective , 12th , 5th , 16th and 10th might not look bad for a team that was playing in the @entity102 just five years ago , but @entity4 are not a small club			2
@entity4 fans portray @entity0 as @entity104 during their side 's match against @entity49 in september supporters of the @entity108 hold up a ' sack @entity0 ' sign at @entity49 's @entity110 in the eye of the modern fan , @entity4 have been consigned to an afterthought of ‘ past - its ’ , rather than ever noted as serious contenders			1
this , in part , has been down to a lack of ambition			0
@entity0 ( and indeed @entity3 ) seem perfectly happy to tread water , to do just about enough to satisfy the very minimum of fan demands and to keep the club chugging along			2
as a result , many fans have accused @entity0 of merely towing the party line , attempting to stay in the good books of his puppeteer , @entity3			2
unfortunately , however , passivity and hollowness have been the least of our worries when it comes to @entity0 : the headbutting of @entity134 sticks most readily in the memory , but one must not forget his swearing at the much - revered @entity137 , a verbal attack that verged on criminal			1
when it comes to tactics , too , he appears to be way out of his depth			0
he seems to completely disregard the positional strengths of our players ( @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 to name a few ) who , under the right direction , should be challenging for top - seven football			2
these managerial shortcomings have manifested themselves in our awful domestic cup runs , and his quite frankly embarrassing record against @entity155			0
@entity0 was involved in a confrontation with @entity157 's @entity134 in march 2014 the 53 - year - old was also involved in an altercation with @entity160 manager @entity137 however , in spite of all of these glaring managerial infirmities , he has somehow clung to a sense of entitlement that has only served to intensify the dislike that surrounds him			1
instead of being humble , he ’s been brash and self - celebrating			0
and as a fan , it has become intolerable			0
we tolerate arrogance in football these days , perhaps because we have become immune to it			0
though it is n’t the most endearing of traits in a sporting idol , often it can be just about justified through success			0
we may roll our eyes when @entity178 reminds us of his brilliance , but his goalscoring record is so unbelievably good that we can at least grant him liberties when it comes to self - appraisal			0
when the posturing and prancing comes from @entity0 , however , whose sense of self - entitlement is so odious it is almost tangible , it is far less acceptable			1
he was someone who could bring about short - term gains			0
however , as demonstrated during his time at @entity4 , he was also obviously flawed and incapable of preventing alarming slumps in form , and for a man who is tied down to an eight - year contract , that sort of flaw is unforgiveable			1
when the @entity198 , in october of this year , conducted a poll on whether @entity0 should be sacked from the job , a staggering 94 per cent of @entity4 fans called for his head			1
and when bearing in mind the popular opinion that this remaining six per cent was comprised of @entity155 fans , it is pretty clear just how disliked this man is on @entity16 and how little he will be missed			0
