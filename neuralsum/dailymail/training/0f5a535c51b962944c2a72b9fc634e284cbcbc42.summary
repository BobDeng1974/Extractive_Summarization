by @entity0 published : 10:01 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 13:25 est , 11 october 2013 he solved one of the biggest mysteries in the universe , but nobody knew the whereabouts of @entity7 - the scientist who first predicted the existence of the ‘ @entity10 particle ’ - at the time when he was awarded the @entity12			1
the @entity13 could not raise him on the phone before making the announcement , and said he had gone ‘ into hiding ’			1
but now the famous physicist has revealed that he found out that he had won the award when a woman stopped to congratulate him in the street			2
professor @entity7 said a former neighbour got out of her car in @entity23 as he was returning from lunch and told him the good news			1
the @entity13 could n't contact @entity7 ( pictured ) on the phone before making the @entity12 announcement and said he had gone ¿ into hiding ¿			1
but speaking at the @entity28 , professor @entity7 said a former neighbour got out of her car in @entity23 to tell him the good news speaking at a press conference at the @entity28 , professor @entity7 said : ' she congratulated me on the news and i said " oh , what news ? " ' she told me her daughter phoned from @entity36 to alert her to the fact i had got this prize			1
i heard more about it obviously when i got home and started reading the messages			0
' professor @entity7 was recognised by the @entity13 for his work on the theory of the particle which shares his name , the @entity45			1
the existence of the so - called ' @entity10 particle , ' said to give matter its substance or mass , was proved 50 years on by a team from @entity52 , the @entity54 nuclear research facility in @entity55 , @entity56 , in 2012			0
colleagues had told journalists that the self - effacing 84 - year - old , who has not been well lately , had gone hiking in the @entity60 to avoid the ‘ storm ’ of interest at the time the prize was announced			2
finally proved : professor @entity7 wiped away a tear as scientists at the @entity66 first claimed to have discovered the @entity45			1
but the 84 - year - old went hiking in the @entity60 to avoid the ' storm ' of interest in the @entity69 born in @entity73 in 1929 , the son of a @entity72 sound engineer , @entity7 was a gifted pupil at @entity75 ’s @entity74 where he won many prizes – although none for physics			2
he chose to study at @entity80 , after rejecting @entity81 and @entity82 as the choice of the ‘ idle rich ’ , and gained a first - class honours degree in 1950			2
he was a young lecturer at @entity28 in 1964 when he dreamed up the particle that would make him famous			2
along with two other groups of scientists who were working independently , he came up with an explanation of how the most basic building blocks of the universe gain mass. the theory states that the cosmos is pervaded by an invisible field that confers mass on particles as they pass through it			0
unlike the other scientists of the time , professor @entity7 also forecast the field was made up of countless tiny particles – higgs bosons , or @entity10 particles			1
the theory was not universally accepted and one of his papers was rejected for publication because it was ‘ of no obvious relevance to physics ’			0
but by the 1980s , the hunt for the @entity45 was on in earnest and last year , almost 50 years after professor @entity7 predicted its existence , scientists at the @entity66 found it			1
giving his reaction to receiving the prize for the first time , at the university where as a young lecturer in 1964 , he dreamed up the particle that would make him famous , he said : ' how do i feel ? well , obviously i ’m delighted and rather relieved in a sense that it ’s all over			1
it ’s been a long time coming			1
' an old friend told him he had been nominated as far back as 1980 , he explained			0
professor @entity7 said he had been having lunch in @entity124 in the @entity60 capital when the announcement was made on tuesday			1
describing the low - key way he learned of the prize , he told the assembled press he was walking up @entity130 in the @entity131 when the former neighbour spoke to him			0
but there will be a champagne celebration with family this evening			2
' there was a celebration with a group of us last night after a lecture by @entity141 - that was a start , ' he said			0
' i shall be celebrating with my family with the help of a bottle or two of champagne early this evening			2
' it has n’t been possible to get us all together before that			0
' professor @entity7 , who shares this year ’s prize with @entity151 of @entity152 , joins the ranks of past @entity12 winners including @entity155 and @entity156			1
the 84 - year - old is an emeritus professor at the @entity28			2
the @entity159 award recognises the ' theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles '			0
that mechanism predicted the existence of the @entity45 , which enables particles to acquire mass. its discovery is of huge significance to the theory that enables scientists to understand the physical universe , known as the @entity177			0
professor @entity7 ( pictured right ) , who shares this year 's prize with @entity151 of @entity152 ( left ) , joins the ranks of past @entity12 winners including @entity155 and @entity156			1
the 84 - year - old is an emeritus professor at the @entity28 professor @entity7 established the concept of the ' @entity10 particle ' while working as a lecturer in 1964			1
he wrote two scientific papers on his theory and was eventually published in the @entity186 journal , sparking a hunt for the elusive particle			0
other researchers , including professor @entity151 , were also working separately on the same idea as professor @entity7 and published papers around the same time			1
@entity66 : the magnet core of the world 's largest superconducting solenoid magnet in @entity52 a new particle ' consistent ' with the @entity45 was discovered last year by a team at the @entity66 at @entity52 , the @entity52 , near @entity55			0
professor @entity7 said he celebrated on the return flight from @entity52 last year with a bottle of @entity200 beer , which he was presented with during today ’s press conference			1
he said : ' i think i face the immediate future with some foreboding because having experienced the wave of attention which followed the announcement at @entity52 in july 2012 , i anticipated that this last announcement will trigger an order of magnitude of more attention			0
' i think i am going to have difficulty in the next few months having any of my life to myself			0
' i should remind you that although only two of us have shared this prize , @entity151 of @entity219 and myself , that the work in 1964 involved three groups of people , ( including ) two in @entity219			0
' unfortunately @entity222 died a few years ago so is no longer able to be awarded the prize , but he would certainly have been one of the winners if he had still be alive			0
' but there were three others who also contributed and it is already difficult to allocate the credit amongst the theorists			0
' although a lot of people seem to think i did all this single - handed , it was actually part of a theoretical programme which had been started in 1960			0
' professor @entity7 was made a @entity235 in the @entity236 and the @entity237 has been set up by the @entity238 to recognise school pupils who excel in physics			1
he was joined at today ’s event by @entity28 principal professor sir @entity242 and dr @entity243 , a reader in the @entity244 who works with @entity52 and is a former student of @entity247 .			2

@entity13 could n't contact @entity7 on the phone before making the announcement , and said he had gone ‘ into hiding ’
speaking at the @entity28 , professor @entity7 said a former neighbour got out of her car in @entity23 to tell him the good news
the physicist said he is delighted and ' rather relieved ' that the award giving is over , as it had been ' a long time coming '
he said he would celebrate with my family and a bottle of champagne this evening
