by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 04:43 est , 6 july 2012 frustrated : @entity1 said sport in state schools was being ' squeezed out ' too many of @entity6 's @entity5 athletes went to public schools , @entity1 said yesterday as he called for barriers to be broken so all children could achieve their sporting potential			1
the prime minister claimed that fee - paying schools were producing ' more than their fair share ' of medal winners while sport in state schools was being ' squeezed out ' with rundown facilities and children lacking ambition			1
at the @entity20 in @entity21 , almost 40 per cent of @entity6 's medal winners had been privately educated – and that rose to 100 per cent of winners in equestrian events			1
with about a third of the 2012 squad expected to have been educated privately , mr @entity1 lamented the numbers of top sportsmen from less well - off backgrounds			1
he said : ' @entity30 can change lives			0
so why is it that in so many schools sport has been squeezed out and facilities run down ? ' the result is that independent schools produce more than their fair share of medal winners and too many children think taking part in sport just is n't for them			1
we 've got to change that			0
@entity52 started boxing at @entity54 in a speech at @entity60 yesterday , mr @entity1 , who went to @entity55 , one of the top fee - paying schools in the country , urged young people to look up to elite athletes such as runner @entity48 and cyclist @entity61 who were both educated at state schools			1
he added : ' some of the barriers that hold young people back are in their minds : about imagined barriers of aspiration and confidence			2
the @entity5 are a chance to break them down			1
' i 'm not claiming one @entity5 will turn every child into tomorrow 's @entity48 or @entity61 , but just look where our great athletes have come from			2
@entity50 started running with the @entity51			0
@entity52 started boxing at @entity54			0
' sustaining the momentum of the @entity75 means opening people 's eyes to the possibility of sport			2
' getting young people to follow their heroes and take part at school and in their local clubs			0
' his comments came after education secretary @entity86 warned that a ' profoundly unequal ' education system meant that private school pupils were dominating positions of wealth and power in @entity6			0
the prime minister went on to claim that the @entity5 , which have so far cost £ 9.3billion , would boost the economy by £ 13billion over the next four years from new business deals , foreign investment and tourism			2
@entity97 said the figure included £ 1billion in additional sales by @entity101 companies , up to £ 4billion in business opportunities , £ 6billion in foreign investment , and £ 2billion from an increase of about four million tourists			0
mr @entity1 said : ' now there 's a further reason why the @entity75 have got to be great for @entity6 too – they should be great for our economy			2
' we should n't see them as some sort of expensive luxury in tough times			0
because it 's precisely because times are tough that we have got to get everything we can out of these games , to support jobs and to support growth in the economy			0
' video : @entity1 says too many olympians from public schools ...			1

@entity1 says more people from state schools should be reaching the @entity5
