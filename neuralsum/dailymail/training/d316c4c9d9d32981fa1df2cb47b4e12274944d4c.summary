by @entity0 an 85 - year - old @entity2 man has earned the reputation of being perhaps the world 's oldest stalker after making unwanted amorous advances to an 80 - year - old great grandmother			1
the granddad fell for the octogenarian apple of his eye when they shared a hospital room with his wife , who has since died			1

@entity17 , 85 , was arrested for breaking into a 80 - year - old woman 's home after he left numerous messages on her answering machine wanting to ' go out ' he started leaving telephone messages on her phone 's answering machine to the effect of ' i 'm waiting outside your house			1
' the unnamed great granny was having nothing of it and complained to the police			0
@entity17 was warned to stay away from the woman but when he continued with the messages he was given a second warning			0
but , the @entity44 website reported , his behaviour escalated to the point that on may 2 he broke into the woman 's house			2
