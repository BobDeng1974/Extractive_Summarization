a serving @entity1 soldier who went to fight @entity2 was being flown home last night after he was found near the border between @entity5 and @entity6			1
the 19 - year - old private serving with the 2nd battalion of @entity9 left for the region last week after telling his parents he wanted to help the @entity12			1
he was the first @entity1 soldier to have gone to fight against the terror group and his disappearance fuelled fears that he could have been a prime beheading target for @entity19 jihadists			2
the 19 - year - old soldier who reportedly left to fight against @entity2 is now returning to his unit , it emerged today the soldier , who is now said to be ‘ safe and well ’ , was in @entity24 on leave from his base in @entity27 when he decided to travel to the war - torn country			1
he was due back at his base yesterday when it emerged the @entity32 had located him and were flying him back			2
the @entity32 refused to confirm whether they had found him or whether he had reached out , but last week a defence source said they would not send police to the @entity35 looking for him			2
speaking during commons defence questions , defence secretary @entity36 said : ‘ @entity38 may also want to know the soldier reported as missing last week has now been located and is being returned to his unit			1
’ as the soldier was not considered @entity42 , it is not clear whether he will face disciplinary action			2
a defence source said : ‘ we are just grateful to have him back at the moment			0
’ the private is understood to be serving with the 2nd battalion of @entity9 pictured : @entity12 fighters outside @entity51 , @entity6			1
a number of foreign fighters have come from around the world to join @entity12 forces in the battle against @entity2 the soldier , who has not been named for security reasons , left his base after sending a message to his family saying : ' i 'm with other @entity1 people and a @entity64 at the moment			1
i do n't know how to explain it to you but i really want and need to do this and i will be safe			0
he added : ' i have good skills and i can speak the language , i can help these people and help with this fight			0
i will get in trouble for being @entity42 , but it 's minor and no prison sentence			0
' the private joined up at the age of 16 after leaving school and had reportedly been learning @entity79			0
he was said to have once shared a barracks with murdered fusilier @entity82			0
he is understood to have visited the area with the military for a training exercise before he decided to return to fight			0
he is thought to have been fighting alongside a group called @entity87 , who have @entity89 , @entity64 and other @entity1 among their number			0
the serviceman , who has not been named for security reasons , was stationed in @entity27 and is believed to have travelled to the region via @entity24 while on annual leave			0
he is thought to have then entered @entity6 the soldier reportedly posted a picture online over the weekend showing him standing next to @entity64 ex-serviceman @entity97			1
in the post , he referred to @entity97 as his ' wingman ' and , in a message to his family , added : ' i 'm all safe guys			1
' the @entity9 are based at the @entity104 , where the soldier will return to find out whether he faces a court martial			1
in december it emerged that two former @entity1 soldiers had travelled to @entity5 to fight against @entity2 after feeling ' compelled ' to take up arms following the murder of aid volunteer @entity111			0
news of the soldier came as the defence secretary was urged to clarify exactly what @entity1 's plan is for the campaign against @entity2 in @entity6			1
@entity119 mp @entity118 said it was troubling defence chiefs had failed to outline the objectives for the campaign against @entity2 , also known as @entity2 , in recent evidence to a @entity126 committee			0
speaking at @entity131 questions , the @entity128 and @entity129 mp mr @entity118 said : ' do you think it is acceptable none of the service chiefs who gave evidence to the defence committee 's recent inquiry was willing or able to articulate the @entity1 's objective or strategic plan in @entity6 ? what is our plan exactly ? ' mr @entity36 replied : ' our plan in @entity6 is very simple - it is to disrupt threats to the @entity1 mainland and our interests overseas , secondly it is as part of an international coalition to defeat @entity2 , including discrediting its violent ideology			1
' it is thirdly to mitigate the impact of @entity2 and other violent extremist groups on the stability of the region as a whole			0
' it is understood the @entity1 soldier joined a group called the @entity163 , who boast , ' it is better to live one day as a @entity165 that a thousand days as a sheep			0
' they are the foreign fighters who have travelled to @entity5 to fight , not for jihad , but on behalf of the @entity12 communities who are defending their communities from the advance of @entity173			1
just as hundreds of young @entity174 have gone to fight for the radical islamists of @entity176 , so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies , the @entity178			0
westerners in @entity178 : a photo of @entity182 fighters from the @entity184 page @entity185 , a former @entity89 soldier now with @entity186 ( @entity187 ) , operates @entity188 openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight			1
just as many of the @entity176 's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of @entity195 youth worldwide , many of the initial @entity187 volunteers have come from the @entity12 diaspora			1
last august a hairdresser from @entity200 was reported to be the first @entity201 to travel to fight alongside @entity12 forces			2
ethnic @entity204 @entity203 from @entity205 , 26 , travelled to @entity6 to join the @entity12 peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt @entity176 's lightning advance			2
but since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against @entity176 , perhaps also inspired by the radical socialist experiment underway in the @entity12 autonomous region of @entity212			2
brothers in arms : briton @entity214 , right , with @entity89 @entity185 , who is also fighting in @entity5 inspired by the social ecologist and anarchist @entity217 it has adopted a vision of ' libertarian municipalism ' calling for @entity178 to create free , self - governing communities			0
last october it was reported that a currently serving @entity1 @entity222 had been questioned by police on suspicion he was travelling to fight with @entity12 militias during his leave			1
the 22 - year - old commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from @entity228 on a one - way ticket to @entity230			1
he was suspected of being in contact with @entity12 militant groups			2
two women , @entity234 , 31 , and @entity235 , 20 , have also reportedly travelled to fight with the @entity178 , inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against @entity176 terrorists			2
it is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict			0
there are also claims that a number of @entity174 biker gangs have travelled to @entity5 and are helping to assist the resistance			0
leaders of the @entity252 - based @entity251 , which has strong @entity12 links , have posted images of their @entity256 riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons			1
the news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the @entity262 were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to @entity264 to join the fight against @entity2 .			0
