by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 19:02 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 09:18 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 , pictured arriving at the @entity3 in @entity1 , challenged @entity5 chief @entity4 over controversial remarks by a commissioner @entity2 clashed angrily with @entity8 last night as the government admitted it can do little to reduce the ‘ overwhelming incentive ’ for people to migrate to @entity11 from poorer @entity3 countries			1
the prime minister , in @entity15 for talks with @entity3 leaders , denounced an @entity3 commissioner who said his plans to limit migrants ’ rights to benefits risked making @entity11 the ‘ nasty party of @entity24 ’			1
mr @entity2 said @entity26 ’s comments were ‘ inappropriate ’ for an official paid for by @entity11 and @entity24 taxpayers - suggesting he thinks he should be sacked			1
defending his proposals to tighten the rules on welfare , the prime minister insisted more fundamental reforms to the key @entity3 principle of freedom of movement to find work within other states			1
mr @entity2 , speaking at a state dinner in @entity1 , told other leaders they must not repeat the mistakes of the past by allowing workers from new member states unfettered access to other countries			0
‘ i support [ @entity3 ] enlargement			2
but we ca n’t do that without addressing abuse of free movement and how it works in future , ’ the prime minister said			1
in an unusually blunt exchange with mr @entity26 ’s boss , @entity5 chief @entity4 , mr @entity2 also suggested the commissioner should be brought into line			1
he insisted he should not dismiss elected @entity24 leaders raising ‘ substantive concerns ’ from the public without any discussion			0
mr @entity26 , @entity3 commissioner for employment , claimed this week that @entity2 ’s plans to curb benefits for migrants were fuelling ‘ hysteria ’ and could lead to competing demands from other member states that would scupper the single market			1
he said mr @entity2 ’s plans to limit benefit payments to migrants from @entity71 and @entity72 when controls are lifted on january 1 are ‘ an unfortunate overreaction ’			2
’ @entity8 is facing a growing revolt over its no - borders immigration policy , with @entity96 and @entity97 also suggesting they want curbs on @entity3 migrants ’ rights			1
mr @entity2 , who has been criticised for refusing to give an estimate of how many @entity72 and @entity71 will come to @entity11 next year , has outlined plans to limit the rights of temporary workers to housing benefit , and a 12 - month bar on those fund begging and sleeping rough			2
home secretary @entity109 suggested moves to cap the number of @entity3 migrants to the @entity11 in order to stop @entity11 workers languishing on the dole			1
writing for the @entity117 website , mrs may suggested that the government ’s attempts to make the @entity11 a less attractive destination - by restricting access to welfare and introducing an annual levy for use of the @entity123 - were likely to have limited effect			2
‘ in all honesty , whatever the government does in terms of reducing the pull factors that draw people to @entity11 , as long as there is such an enormous disparity between @entity3 member states in terms of income per head , there will be an overwhelming incentive for people to move from poorer member states to richer member states , ’ she said			1
summit : mr @entity2 told other leaders they must not repeat the mistakes of the past by allowing workers from new member states unfettered access to other countries mrs may added : ‘ that not only puts pressure on communities in countries like @entity11 , it robs poorer @entity3 member states of their most talented people			1
so in future , we must put in place new arrangements to slow full access to each other ’s labour markets until we can be sure it will not lead to mass migration			0
‘ this could , for example , be achieved by requiring new member states to reach a certain level of income or economic output per head before full free movement is allowed			0
policy : home secretary @entity109 suggested capping @entity3 migration to stop @entity11 workers languishing on the dole ‘ is it right that there should be unfettered access to our labour markets , even if there is high unemployment amongst @entity11 workers ? ’ she said yesterday ’s immigration statistics showed the @entity128 had made important progress but still faced serious challenges			1
‘ in the year to june 2013 , annual net migration stood at 182,000			0
this is a reduction of nearly a third since its peak in 2010 , when it stood at 255,000			0
but it represents an unwelcome increase in net migration in the last year - and it is still too high			0
‘ where the government can control net migration - and this is limited to immigration from outside the @entity196 - our policies are working			0
net migration from outside the @entity3 continues to fall sharply			2
it is down from 218,000 since its peak in 2010 , and from 172,000 last year , to 140,000 this year			0
‘ we have restricted economic migration from outside the @entity3 , and economic immigration is down			2
we have tightened the rules for family visas , and family immigration is down - by more than one fifth			0
we have ended the industrial - scale abuse of the student visa system we saw under the last government , closed down hundreds of bogus colleges , and student immigration is down - by almost a third			0
‘ @entity221 , ‘ students ’ were turning up at @entity212 unable to answer basic questions in @entity214 or even give simple details about their course - those days are now gone			0
and the latest visa statistics - which run ahead of the net migration statistics - show these figures should continue to fall			0

@entity2 clashed angrily with @entity8 over migration policy
prime minister said @entity26 ’s remarks were ‘ inappropriate ’
commissioner accused @entity225 of fueling ' hysteria ' and not telling the truth
@entity2 uses @entity15 summit to push reforms of freedom of movement
@entity109 admits @entity3 *wealth* gap creates ' incentive ' to move to @entity11
