rapist : footballer @entity1 is due to be released within days			1
his victim has had to go into hiding due to online taunts the woman who was raped by footballer @entity1 is in hiding two years on – thanks to an internet campaign branding her a ‘ money - grabbing ’ liar			1
the victim was forced to adopt a new identity and leave her home town after @entity1 ’ supporters broke the law by posting her name on @entity15 in 2012			1
and now , just days before the @entity18 striker is due to be released from jail , the woman has had to endure a further spate of online slurs			2
the campaign of abuse has been given fresh impetus by controversial comments from broadcaster @entity26 , who claimed during @entity28 ’s loose women show on monday that the rape was ‘ unpleasant ’ but ‘ not violent ’ and the victim had ‘ had far too much to drink ’			2
she later apologised after a furious backlash			0
but yesterday @entity1 ’ mother took to @entity15 to praise miss @entity26 ’s intervention and highlight barbed comments still being posted by other users			1
following the footballer ’s rape conviction and five - year jail sentence in 2012 , thousands of people – among them @entity1 ’ friends and relatives – branded the victim a liar and named her on social media , despite her legal entitlement to lifelong anonymity as the victim of a sex attack			1
a web search today will still bring up sites claiming to name her and making vile comments about her part in the case			0
police said that while some of the so - called ‘ trolls ’ were male football fans , the majority were women , many of whom made deeply personal attacks on the victim ’s motivation in reporting the rape			1
@entity1 and his former @entity70 youth side team - mate @entity69 had been out in his home town of @entity72 , @entity73 in may 2011 and had booked a room at a nearby @entity75 , their trial heard			1
he later told police they could have had ‘ any girl we wanted ’ , saying : ‘ we are footballers , that ’s how it is			0
footballers are rich , they have got money , that ’s what the girls like			0
when @entity1 entered the room , he found the pair having sex , and claimed @entity69 asked if he wanted to have sex with the girl too , saying she had been ‘ in control ’ of herself			1
@entity1 left the hotel via a fire escape shortly after having sex with her , later telling police he had been worried his girlfriend @entity108 would phone him and become suspicious			1
following the footballer ’s rape conviction and five - year jail sentence in 2012 , thousands of people – among them @entity1 ’ friends and relatives – branded the victim a liar and named her on social media the girl awoke the next morning , naked and alone , and told police the last thing she could remember was being in a takeaway			1
@entity69 was acquitted of rape by the jury at @entity123 , but @entity1 looked shocked as he was found guilty			2
he was told by the judge he ‘ must have realised ’ that she had been ‘ in no condition to have sexual intercourse ’			0
appeal court judges refused a bid to overturn the conviction , saying there was ‘ no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury ’ , also throwing out an attempt to cut his sentence			0
@entity1 , 25 , is desperate to resume his football career when he is released on friday from @entity139 prison in @entity140 , half way through his sentence			2
but a petition appealing to @entity18 chairman @entity143 not to reinstate him had attracted almost 150,000 signatures after miss @entity26 ’s comments			0
making her debut on monday ’s @entity147 , miss @entity26 argued @entity1 should be allowed to play football again , saying : ‘ i am not by any means minimising any kind of rape , but the rape was not violent			2
‘ he did n’t cause any bodily harm to the person			0
in a hotel room i believe			1
and she had had far too much to drink			0
but he has served his time			0
’ she later apologised ‘ unreservedly ’			0
yesterday @entity160 police and crime commissioner @entity161 , who campaigns over violence against women , said : ‘ he raped her – that is a serious injury			1
if you get drunk and someone steals your wallet , does this mean it ’s any less of a theft than if you were sober ? ’ in 2012 , around 6,000 people mentioned the victim on @entity15 alone			2
but just 21 were arrested , and after ten pleaded guilty to breaching the @entity172 in 2012 , they were ordered to pay her compensation totalling just £ 6,000			0
the punishment was branded ‘ an insult to rape victims ’ at the time .			0

the woman was raped by @entity1 in a hotel room in 2011
his supporters named her on @entity15 , calling her a ' money - grabbing liar '
police said that while some of ' trolls ' were male , the majority were women
