@entity18 ’s @entity17 in @entity19 , @entity2 is ‘ in crisis ’ after more than half its teaching staff resigned and parents holding signs and placards staged a protest outside the school			1
it follows the appointment of headmistress @entity6 in january as part of attempts by @entity30 to raise standards at the school			1
mrs @entity6 made headlines last year after she ‘ banned ’ all 515 at another @entity2 primary from mentioning @entity15 before december 1 in case it distracted them from their work			1
she said that children would lose their ‘ golden time ’ if festivities were talked about before december			0
she said the same would apply to mentions of @entity16			0
a group of 20 parents convened outside @entity45 last week to protest that the head had turned the school into a ‘ living hell ’			1
they said the school was ‘ in crisis ’ amid a mass departure of staff and children were missing out on school trips , pe lessons , sports days and other activities			1
the school has 15 teachers and 27 teaching assistants but 25 of them have announced they will not be returning after the summer holidays			2
@entity63 , 28 , who has four children at the school aged three to eight , said : ‘ since mrs @entity6 came in all communication has broken down			1
‘ sports days and trips have been cancelled , since she took over the school has been hell			2
my children can not cope with the changes			0
‘ the two year 5 and 6 classes have been combined and my boy is chewing his jumper because he is worried about the instability			0
’ around half of the staff at @entity79 in @entity19 , @entity2 are believed to be leaving over the summer @entity80 , a @entity82 representative , said the ‘ exodus ’ of teachers and teaching staff was an ‘ incredible and catastrophic crisis ’ , telling the local paper : ‘ it is obviously a very challenging school			1
‘ i have put forward a formal complaint from teachers and teaching staff to @entity92			2
‘ there are significant issues and there is a huge amount of insecurity with so many staff leaving the children have no stability			1
’ another parent , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ since january it has been all change and you can see by the number of teaching staff leaving that everyone thinks the same - the teachers , the parents and the children , they all want out			1
’ but other parents gave a different perspective			2
@entity112 , 42 , said : ‘ they ( protesters ) are all scared of change			0
‘ i do n’t quite know what they ’re hoping for			0
do they want the head out because she ’s making changes ? if it ’s not her it will be someone else			0
‘ from what we ’ve seen of her she ’s been brilliant and helpful , and the kids love her			0
’ according to a 2012 @entity126 report the school is ‘ satisfactory ’ , which means it is deemed to ‘ require improvement ’ under new @entity126 categories			2
ms @entity6 has caused controversy in the past by threatening to punish children for talking about @entity16 or @entity15 , claiming pupils were getting distracted from their work in november last year , mrs @entity6 was branded a ‘ @entity138 ’ after banning children at nearby @entity137 from mentioning @entity15 before december 1			1
she said at the time : ‘ i ’m not joking when i say this started 2,000 years ago			0
‘ the long and short of it is that one of the golden rules is to work hard , so if children are not working hard , talking about @entity15 for instance , then they will lose their golden time			0
‘ that would be the case with anything not related to school ; they should n’t be talking about @entity16 either			0
‘ if they are talking about something they should n’t be , they ’re not working hard ; we are a school , we ’re about education , not retail			0
’ mrs @entity6 remains in charge of @entity159 as well as @entity160			2
a @entity92 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 was brought in at the request of the local authority to raise academic standards and the quality of teaching - as she had done at @entity167 in @entity19			1
‘ @entity92 takes complaints seriously and the governing body at @entity170 will make sure they are properly investigated and that any response is appropriate			0
