by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 09:01 est , 31 december 2012 a canine commuter stunned passengers by attempting to travel solo on the @entity3 after boarding a tube during rush hour			2
station staff saw the @entity8 trot calmly through the ticket barriers , bound down to the platform using an escalator and jump aboard a @entity13 line tube at @entity14			1
the intrepid traveller - who station staff joked could have been trying to travel to @entity18 , ' @entity23 or ' @entity22 ' @entity19 's @entity20 - even climbed on to a seat			0
ready for the off : joy the @entity8 , does n't seem to understand the hold up as she took her seat on the 6.55am @entity3 - bound @entity13 tube from @entity30 station thankfully staff spotted her before the train left the station and she was carried across @entity3			2
the @entity34 is now trying to trace the owner of the brindle and white - coloured dog , who started her tube journey at @entity14 in @entity3 at 6.55am on december 20			1
@entity34 inspector @entity40 , who has named the dog @entity41 , said : ' she scampered through the station so confidently we think she must be a frequent commuter			0
bundle of @entity41 : the @entity8 seemed happy to be out and about when @entity34 officers pictured her - so much so they have named her @entity41 last stop : the @entity34 is now trying to trace the owner of the brindle and white - coloured dog , who started - and ended - her tube journey at @entity14 station ' people said she looked just as if she was waiting for the train to go			1
' she is a bit scruffy and has a skin condition and a cut under her eye			0
' @entity41 is obviously a seasoned traveller because she found her way down to the trains and perhaps she was just hoping to go into @entity3 for some @entity63 shopping ? '			0

the *daring* dog was spotted boarding the @entity13 line at @entity14
she was seen waiting *patiently* for the train to leave the @entity3 station at 6.55am on december 20
@entity34 officers are now trying to trace her owner
