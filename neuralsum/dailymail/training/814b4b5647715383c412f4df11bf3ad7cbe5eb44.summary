by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 02:12 est , 1 june 2012 a boy of 12 who raped a nine - year - old girl after watching hard - core pornography online was spared jail yesterday as his lawyer warned of a generation of children growing up with a ‘ skewed view ’ on sex			1
the schoolboy , who is now 14 , told police he had raped the little girl because he wanted to ‘ feel grown up ’ after watching porn online			1
in a disturbing case that has raised fresh concerns about the sexualisation of children , the teenager had unrestricted access to the web and was able to freely look at sexually explicit material			1
attack : the boy , now aged 14 , had unrestricted access to the internet and had watched the sex acts online ( picture posed by model ) he then ‘ emulated ’ the graphic footage and attacked a neighbour ’s daughter , the @entity29 in @entity30 heard			1
yesterday his lawyer warned the case was just the ‘ tip of the iceberg ’ and many other cases were going unreported			1
the @entity38 has campaigned for an automatic block on online porn , calling for a consultation on the introduction of content filtering systems for internet accounts			1
@entity46 , defending the boy , said : ‘ there is a real risk that young people are growing up with a skewed view of what sex is and sexual activity			2
‘ this was an emulation of an adult act witnessed by him at this young age			2
he was afforded unfettered access to the internet and it has become apparent from a very young age , the age of 12 , he was accessing hard - core pornography			2
’ decision : @entity64 opted not to jail the boy and sent him to a a children 's panel where he can be kept under continuing supervision mr @entity46 said it was a great concern that children may be getting their sex education through internet pornography			2
he warned : ‘ this is the tip of the iceberg			1
many , many cases throughout the country may not be identified , not reported , not coming to anyone ’s attention			2
’ the shocking case , on the @entity80 in @entity81 , only came to light when the young victim felt ill and told her mother she feared there was ‘ a baby in my tummy ’			1
asked if something had happened to her , she became hysterical before revealing what the boy had done			0
police discovered the girl had been sexually assaulted a number of times in a shed in the garden of her home between december 1 , 2010 and january 31 2011			0
the boy , who lived next door , also abused the girl in his bedroom in front of a 12 - year - old friend			0
when he was interviewed by police the boy pointed out the sites he had viewed and when asked why he had copied them , he answered ‘ temptation ’ and ‘ to feel grown up ’			0
he was later placed in a secure unit hundreds of miles away			0
earlier this month the teenager stood shaking in the dock as he pleaded guilty to one charge of rape and two of sexual assault			0
sentencing : the boy , 12 , was spared a jail term when he appeared before @entity30 's @entity29 the extraordinary case was heard in a closed courtroom with only relatives of the children and care workers present			1
judge @entity64 said he should be given advice on handling relationships and sexual development rather than face jail			0
she handed him a four year supervision order to be carried out under the @entity127 , which means he will be closely supervised by social workers until the age of 18			0
she told the boy he was being given an opportunity to ‘ make something of yourself ’			0
judge @entity64 went on : ‘ you should not and must not regard pornography as any guide at all as to how to behave sexually			0
you should not have engaged in sexual activity of any sort with a nine - year - old girl or indeed any other young girl who , under our law , is not able to consent to it			0
’ the @entity38 has led a campaign calling for greater curbs on access to online pornography			1
the government is to consider introducing web filters to make adults ‘ opt in ’ if they wish to view pornography on their computers			1
@entity155 will consult on whether to introduce automatic filters – or a less stringent system where users would have to make an ‘ active choice ’ on whether to view explicit sites when they sign up with an internet service provider			2
last night @entity162 , chief executive of the children 1st charity , said the case illustrated the importance of the @entity38 ’s campaign			1
she said : ‘ it ’s everyone ’s responsibility to protect children and young people from the potential risks			0
‘ internet providers play a huge role in supporting families to achieve this and we would support recent calls for them to block inappropriate websites unless an adult has legally opted in to view content			2
‘ although the internet puts lots of possibilities at children and young people ’s fingertips and provides access to many positive activities and opportunities , children , young people and their families must be aware that even if it feels like a virtual world , the internet has real - life consequences			0

@entity198 was copying acts he had watched online , court hears
his lawyer warned that the case was just the ' tip of the iceberg ' , with many others going unreported
@entity38 has led a campaign calling for a *default* block on online porn which web users can opt out of
