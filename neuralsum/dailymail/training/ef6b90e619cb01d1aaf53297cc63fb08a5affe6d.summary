by @entity0 @entity2 's association with @entity3 has hit another snag , with the supermarket forced to undertake a product recall on all plush toys from the @entity9 range			1
the range includes eight characters - @entity11 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			2
' all eight characters may liberate stuffing during use and the hands and feet are small parts that are inadequately attached , presenting a potential choking hazard , ' the @entity21 website said			1
' the products were sold across the nation in @entity3 and @entity41 supermarkets from may 21 to june 16			0
another recall was issued earlier this week by the supermarket giant , but it was only for the bean character			0
@entity2 is the face of the campaign to get kids eating more fruit and vegetables customers who have purchased these toys should stop using the product as a precaution and return them to a @entity3 or @entity41 store for a full refund			1
' @entity3 apologises to its customers for any inconvenience caused by this recall , ' the supermarket 's website said			0
it has not been smooth sailing for the @entity9 campaign			2
it is not the first time the campaign has run into trouble			0
earlier this month fruit growers expressed outrage about a 40 cents a crate levy for marketing of @entity9 earlier this month , vegetable growers were outraged by the supermarket giant charging them 40 cents a crate to pay for the marketing of @entity9 , in addition to a promotional fee they were already forking over to @entity3 , @entity73 claims			1
one grower reportedly claimed it would cost them an extra $ 300,000 for the campaign , while others would be paying tens of thousands			2
it sparked the group that represents growers , @entity85 , to write to the celebrity chef and pleaded with him to talk to @entity3 about cancelling the fee .			0
