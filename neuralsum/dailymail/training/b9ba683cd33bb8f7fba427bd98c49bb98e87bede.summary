by @entity0 published : 20:53 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 03:44 est , 5 december 2013 newsreader @entity1 has revealed he still has n't made his mind up about @entity3 - despite being the son of a @entity5 as the son of a bishop , you might think he would have made his mind up on religion long ago			1
but at the age of 66 , it seems @entity1 still prefers to hedge his bets when it comes to believing in @entity3			1
the veteran newsreader – whose father was the @entity5 - has revealed he enjoys all the trappings of faith , but is still unsure whether he is religious			1
despite claiming to go to a small @entity18 church in @entity19 – where he spends his weekends – once or twice a month , he told the @entity22 [ must credit ] : ‘ i like the contemplation , the hour of peace , the hymns and the community			1
dunno if that makes me religious			2
i believe in the collective power of the human spirit			0
is that who @entity3 is ? i do n’t think my father would say so			2
’ as a boy , mr @entity1 spent five years as a chorister in @entity34 and attended the staunchly @entity35 , where his father @entity36 was headmaster			1
the @entity38 anchor – who has two children with his former partner @entity40 – married for the first time aged 62			0
he and @entity43 academic @entity42 – who is 27 years his junior – tied the knot on a @entity47 beach instead of walking down a church aisle			2
known for his brightly coloured ties while presenting the news , mr @entity1 insisted he is a rebel at heart			1
he said : ‘ if you asked people around here , they ’d say i was one of the most conservative forces in the newsroom – that ’s small ‘ c ’ – but there is a rebel in me			1
‘ i ’m wearing a bright tie largely because they told me colours on television did n’t work			1
in old - fashioned colour tv they would blow out a bit			2
’ and the newsreader – who claimed he is a ‘ poor presenter ’ – admitted he secretly loves the attention that comes with his high tv profile			2
he said : ‘ either the camera loves you or it does n’t , and if it does n’t there ’s nothing you can do about it			0
if it does , you ’re very lucky			0
and if it loves you , you ’ll love it			0
i love cameras and people coming up and doing selfies			0
’ the 66 - year - old , whose father was the @entity5 , said he goes to church once or twice a month			1
' i like the contemplation , the hour of peace , the hymns and the community , ' he told the @entity22 in february , mr @entity1 revealed he was abducted and abused by a member of staff at @entity35 in 1953			1
he said : ‘ i was six years old when a member of the domestic staff at the school , where my father taught , abducted me			2
‘ he took me to his room and undressed me , and then himself			0
thank heavens someone saw the abduction and eventually a member of staff intervened and rescued me			0
‘ i remember to this day fretting over not being able to do my braces up			0
and i admit that i have found @entity100 regurgitating the guilt and confusion that i felt			0
’ in the past , mr @entity1 has been reticent about his own religious beliefs but has frequently criticised the teachings of church leaders			1
