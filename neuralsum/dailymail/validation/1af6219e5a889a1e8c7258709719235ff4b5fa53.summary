many of us pass urine without thinking – or looking – at the colour of it			2
but perhaps it ’s time to take note , because our pee can say a lot about our health , according to one doctor			0
speaking on @entity13 ’s @entity12 , dr @entity11 explained what each shade of pee – from clear to red to green and blue – tells us about the body			1
he lined up test tubes of a range of colours of urine , from clear through to dark yellow , to red and blue			2
his first piece of advice is to look at the colour of urine while peeing , rather than when it has hit the toilet bowl			1
however , it could be due to blood in the urine , signalling an infection , or tumours or kidney stones he told presenters @entity52 and @entity54 : ' you should look at the colour in the stream that you ’re passing , not when it ’s in the toilet bowl , because it gets diluted in two litres of water			1
’ when asked if this would be a bit difficult for women , he replied : ‘ you can even catch it if you ’re worried			0
’ and when thinking about the colour of our pee , it 's important to remember how food , drink and medication could be affecting it , he added			2
he said : ‘ laxatives can cause a darkening colour of the urine			2
always think about what you ’re putting in your mouth , could that be affecting things ? ’ an example of this is asparagus and food colourants that can turn the urine blue or green			2
meanwhile , urine that is frothy and foamy could be a warning sign someone is eating too much protein and needs to cut back , he said			2
‘ it could be due to protein			0
maybe you ’re on a high protein diet			0
or it could be due to infection			0
' next , he explained what each shade of pee means , in terms of health			0
@entity102 urine could be a sign of a ‘ good hydrated person ’ , dr @entity11 said			1
however , it could be because they are taking diuretic medicine which is making them pass water frequently			0
the diagram , created by the @entity111 , @entity112 , shows that urine should be straw coloured or pale yellow			0
if it is darker , it suggests the person is dehydrated he added : ‘ they might be drinking diuretic - type drinks , such as coffee and alcohol			1
they can cause this effect			0
’ he explained that the kidneys have two main functions : the first being to filter out toxins , create waste matter , and get it out of the body			0
the second is to balance fluid in the body ; the fluid gained from drinks and metabolic reactions in the body , and the fluids lost through sweat			0
a deep yellow coloured urine means the person is more dehydrated			1
he said : ‘ in the morning you might notice your urine is darker coloured than in the evening			0
' this is because in the night you ’ve just been laying there doing nothing and your kidneys have been working concentrating the toxic effects			0
if a person 's urine is brown , it could be a sign of liver disease			1
if it is red , it could contain blood @entity156 urine is normally a sign of dehydration , but could be a liver or bile duct disorder			1
blue or green urine is normally due to food dye or medication ‘ deep yellow urine could be a sign of liver problems which cause jaundice of the skin , eyes , and the urine to become more yellow			1
’ but the most important colour to look out for is a pink or light red colour			0
if a person has red - coloured urine , it could be because they ate certain foods the night before			1
dr @entity11 said : ‘ @entity180 , blackberries , blackcurrants even rhubarb [ are all common culprits ]			1
food colourants are powerful and can get through the kidneys			0
’ however , it could be a more serious sign of infection from the kidney travelling down through the bladder and urethra			2
it could also be due to a tumour , or kidney stones			1
‘ but the commonest reasons for red urine is cystitis - or urinary tract infections , ’ dr @entity11 said			1
‘ this causes excess blood to come out into the urine			0
’ a person with dark red urine is deeply dehydrated , he warned			1
‘ we ’re talking about patients with liver disease , ' he explained			1
foaming or fizzing urine is usually a sign of too much protein in the diet , or a kidney problem			2

@entity212 dr @entity11 advises people to check the colour of their urine
check the colour *mid-stream* , rather than when the pee has hit the bowl
@entity102 urine means a person is hydrated - or has had too much coffee
darker urine could be a sign of jaundice caused by liver disease
red pee may be due to food dye , or a sign of an infection like cystitis
dark red pee could signal blood , signalling a tumour or kidney stones
