stepping down : dr @entity0 has said he will no longer head up two ambulance services at once the controversial boss of two ambulance services has announced he is stepping down from one just 11 months into the job			1
dr @entity0 was already chief executive of @entity4 when he added the @entity6 region to his workload in january			1
he has now said he will go as soon as a replacement can be found			0
the decision came in the week that a harrowing internal report from the @entity6 ambulance service revealed paramedics were leaving bodies at ambulance stations to avoid finishing their shifts late			2
it followed a series of outcries , firstly over his taxpayer - funded £ 232,000 - a - year salary while effectively working part - time in both regions			1
he was then found to be spending a five - figure sum each year on expenses for taxis and hotels			2
in the meantime , he failed to drag response times in the @entity6 to expected national standards			0
@entity29 mp @entity28 yesterday accused both ambulance services of making a ‘ mistake ’ in allowing one person to run them			0
‘ what @entity34 needs is a full - time , dedicated chief executive to move the service forward , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s all about delivery and success and i do n’t think he ’s delivered			0
they were asking one person to do too much			0
’ dr @entity0 will no longer receive the £ 50,000 pay boost he was granted when he took over the dual role			1
health minister dr @entity46 described the remuneration package as ‘ obscene ’ when he was ‘ only doing half a job for each ambulance service ’			2
it then emerged dr @entity0 was spending £ 350 a week on taxis , despite being handed a 2012 silver @entity52 by the @entity55 service			1
officials explained he could n’t drive himself as he needed to work during the three - hour journey to the @entity6 headquarters			2
job number one : dr @entity0 was already in charge of the @entity55 ambulance service , pictured ... job number two : but he then took on the top job at the @entity6 ambulance service too ( above ) instead , a @entity65 would pick him up at his home in @entity67 , @entity68 , and drive him to the site in @entity70 , @entity71			1
he was also staying in hotels twice a week on average , costing more than £ 7,000 a year			1
there was renewed outrage when the body of @entity76 , 32 , who collapsed and died in a @entity71 street , was left beside bins at an ambulance station because paramedics wanted to go home on time rather than take his body to a hospital morgue			0
anger : health minister dr @entity46 described dr @entity0 's remuneration package as ' obscene ' this week ’s report revealed it remained there for two hours and spent so long unrefrigerated that police feared it would affect post-mortem examination tests			2
investigators also uncovered evidence crews were paying undertakers to do the job for them so that they would n’t overrun their shifts			0
other failures in the region include a 92 - year - old second world war bomber veteran who died from a bleed on the brain after waiting 90 minutes for an ambulance when he fell and hit his head			2
the @entity55 service was fined £ 2.6 million in may for missing targets			0
meanwhile @entity6 – which has been paying 60 per cent of dr @entity0 ’s salary - has continued to miss the targets for ambulance response times			1
in november it managed to reach just 71.1 per cent of the most urgent @entity109 ( @entity110 1 ) call - outs within eight minutes against the required 75 per cent			0
a spokesman for @entity113 , which dr @entity0 had signed up to for a two - year period , said : ‘ long ambulance delays are significantly reduced , performance is improving , complaints are down and compliments are up , although we recognise there is still much work for us to do			1
’ the @entity55 service confirmed he would continue as its chief executive			0
dumped : there was renewed outrage when the body of @entity76 , 32 , who collapsed and died in a @entity71 street , was left beside bins at an ambulance station because paramedics wanted to go home			0

dr @entity0 was in charge of @entity55 and @entity6
he now says @entity6 should have a ' dedicated , full - time ' boss
pay packet prompted outrage and claims he was ' only doing half a job '
taxpayers also footed £ 7,000 - a - year hotel bill and £ 350 a week on taxis
dr @entity0 will no longer receive £ 50,000 pay boost from taking dual role
