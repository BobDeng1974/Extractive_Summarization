@entity0 is set for a soaking over the next five days caused by a massive weather system which stretches across the entire width of the @entity4			1
after a huge band of rain sweeps across the country today , intense showers and storms will move in tomorrow followed by heavy downpours over the weekend			0
the wet - but unseasonably warm - weather is being caused by a massive low pressure which is sitting to the west of @entity0 , causing hurricanes in the @entity15 and unsettled conditions in the @entity0			1
after heavy rain across the whole country today , showers will hit the @entity47 and @entity48 tomorrow , with thunder storms predicted in some areas			2
@entity52 forecast maps predict showers will dump up to 16mm of rain an hour on parts of the @entity47 late this evening , before another band of downpours of similar intensity moves into @entity48 and along the south coast tomorrow			1
there will then be a brief let - up on friday morning , before more rain sweeps in from the @entity47 overnight and into saturday morning			0
around 65mm of rain is expected to fall on parts of @entity66 over the next five days - with more than 60mm predicted in @entity67 and @entity68			1
but while heavy rain will hit most areas over the next few days , the storm will also send temperatures soaring to around @entity73 at the weekend - well above average for this time of year			1
a forecaster for @entity76 said : ' today , a band of rain stretching from @entity79 , through northern and eastern parts of @entity81 will continue to drift northwards overnight , reaching all but northern @entity82 by dawn			0
' tomorrow , lingering rain across northern parts of the @entity0 will tend to die out through the day with the best of the sunshine reserved for north - west @entity82			1
the southern half of the @entity0 will have a mild day with sunny intervals and scattered showers			2
' the showers are expected to be heaviest and most frequent in south @entity68 and south - west @entity81 during the afternoon when they may turn thundery			0
' on friday , many areas will be dry and fairly warm with some sunshine , although a few showers are possible in the west			0
turning increasingly wet and windy in the west during the evening			0
on saturday , rain will give way to sunshine and heavy showers			0
remaining very mild for mid-october			0
' @entity52 maps show the swirl of weather fronts caused by the very low pressure system currently sitting in the @entity4 images from @entity27 show the storm moving across the @entity4 on sunday ( left ) into monday ( right ) earlier this week satellite images show the storm stretching from the east coast of the @entity15 right the way across the @entity4 as it swirls towards the @entity0 @entity113 , a forecaster from the @entity114 , says the conditions in the @entity4 make it difficult to know how long the wet weather will last			1
he said : ' a change in the weather pattern from today to a more ' westerly ' flow from the @entity4 and a strong jet stream			1
this will bring more wet weather , but also some very mild temperatures for a time as southerly winds strengthen and draw warmth northwards from @entity128 to western @entity129 , and the @entity130			2
' the detail remains difficult for this weekend with a cold front meandering and waving about over the @entity0			0
' the uncertainty for next week is the time and track of the remains of @entity137 , which is a risk for @entity139 as it speeds north on friday			0
the extra tropical remnants will be caught in the jet stream on monday and move rapidly eastwards towards @entity129 next tuesday			0
' at the moment it could bring a wet and windy spell to the @entity0 next tuesday or dissipate and track further south			0
' commenting on the huge storm , he added : ' the large depression to the west of the @entity0 is beginning to pump up warmth , but also moisture towards the @entity0			2
so , we can turn off the heating , but not quite t - shirt weather so keep the brollies and waterproof coats to handy too			0
' the huge storm is just one of three huge depressions filing the @entity4 at the moment , with @entity159 and @entity137 currently barrelling towards @entity139			1
the first bands of rain caused by the huge storm have already led to flooding in some parts , including this in @entity163 , @entity164 flooded roads caused misery for many people driving to work , with huge tailbacks on the @entity170 as traffic was diverted warnings of further rain follow flooding in the village of @entity176 , @entity177 yesterday after downpours earlier this week @entity180 force winds and high tides coincided yesterday to create huge waves , which battered @entity183 in @entity184 a photo of the sunrise over the @entity187 shows the calm this morning before heavy rain is set to roll across the @entity0 later this week the @entity190 reported on tuesday that the system 's ' central pressure dropped 46 mb in 24 hours ( from 1002 mb to 956 mb ) â€“ a textbook meteorological bomb '			1
the newspaper reported that the conditions are ' likely to bring stormy conditions to the northern @entity197 friday into the weekend '			0
the massive storm is just the latest weather system to move in from the @entity15 and play havoc with @entity0 's climate			1
in august this year , five flood warnings and 33 flood alerts were brought in when the remnants of @entity205 moved up from the @entity25 and swept across @entity0			1
that hurricane formed in the warm waters of the @entity25 first lashed the @entity208 , the @entity209 and the @entity210 and @entity211 with winds of up to 90mph			0
@entity213 then travelled north , veering away from the @entity15 and @entity215 coast before heading across the @entity4 and being downgraded to an ' @entity4 storm ' , which dropped 20mm of rain an hour on some parts of the @entity0			1
but hurricanes emanating from the region are not always bad news for @entity0			2
@entity223 , which ravaged parts of the @entity25 , brought warm weather to the @entity0 later in august this year by dragging an area of high pressure up from @entity129			2
despite the wet weather on the way , parts of @entity0 enjoyed a beautiful sunrise this morning , as this picture of mist over a lake in @entity235 , @entity236 , show sheep emerge from the mist this morning near @entity239 , @entity240			2
the changeable weather is set to continue into next week while these sheep may be in for a further lashing of rain later this week , @entity0 will enjoy temperatures of up to @entity246 over the weekend low lying fog near @entity248 , @entity236			1

the storm will bring heavy downpours to @entity0 , but temperatures are forecast to rise to above @entity73			1

a giant storm is swirling eastward across the @entity4 , sending repeated bands of rain towards the @entity197
flood warnings are now in place in @entity37 and @entity39 and alerts in @entity41 after rivers burst banks yesterday
the massive system , along with two hurricanes named @entity269 and @entity159 , is creating extreme weather in the ocean
despite around 16mm of rain an hour expected to fall on some areas of @entity0 , temperatures will rise to around @entity73
