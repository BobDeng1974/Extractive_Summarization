‘ that 's giving us enough capacity to carry the passenger car traffic that we have got			2
‘ unfortunately , at the moment there is n't enough capacity for all of the trucks			0
that 's why @entity44 is in place			2
’ @entity4 residents also complained about the public costs associated with @entity44 , with police and firefighters positioned along the queue			1
meanwhile , the @entity143 said there were no delays on ferry services			2
but due to volume and the difficulties at the @entity7 , traffic was queuing on approach roads to the port			0
a port statement said : ‘ the @entity143 , together with its major ferry partners , will do all that it can to minimise any customer delays and community impact			0
‘ customers are therefore advised to allow plenty of time for their journey and the community should consider using alternative local routes to move around the area where possible			0
