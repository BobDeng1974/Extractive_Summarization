forget black and white , red and white , love and hate , if you ’re a good footballer you ’ll be just fine			0
that is what @entity4 always told himself , the @entity7 boy who swapped @entity8 for @entity9 in 1997			1
like @entity4 , @entity10 was raised on @entity11 and has now made the controversial switch between the @entity14 rivals , a move only 14 have dared to undertake			1
@entity10 joined @entity8 on a free transfer this summer after leaving @entity9 @entity10 spent 14 years on the books at @entity9 and made his first team debut in 2009 former midfielder @entity4 ( right ) swapped @entity8 for @entity9 in 1997 for @entity10 , though , his defection represented a homecoming – not that the direction of travel and childhood allegiance makes any difference , says @entity4			1
‘ it does n’t matter if you ’ve gone from @entity9 to @entity8 or @entity8 to @entity9 or which team you supported – if you ’re a good footballer and playing well then fans will take to you , ’ the former midfielder told @entity26 ahead of @entity10 ’s first @entity27 for the @entity28			1
‘ and in that respect @entity10 will be just fine			1
he ’s been one of @entity8 ’s best players so far this season			2
midfielder @entity10 ( centre ) has impressed since during his early @entity8 career the 25 - year - old 's performances in the first part of the season earned him a call up to the @entity42 squad ‘ it probably helps a little bit that he ’s a @entity7 coming back to @entity8 , but if you ’re playing poorly that does n’t make any difference really			1
‘ it ’s all about the football , it always is			0
@entity10 scored for @entity9 at @entity51 ’ last year and i bet their fans loved him that day			1
‘ i always told myself when i went to @entity9 , “ play well , hit the ground running , and the fans will clap me ”			2
‘ what matters for @entity10 now is that the @entity8 fans have taken to him – and they ’ve done that for one reason , he ’s been excellent this season			1
’ former @entity9 chairman @entity62 spoke out this week expressing his regret that 25 - year - old @entity10 – who joined the @entity9 at the age of 10 - had been allowed to sign for @entity8 on a free transfer			1
@entity4 , though , sits on the other side of that fence			2
‘ it was one of the best bits of business of the summer getting @entity10 for nothing , ’ said the current boss of @entity69			2
‘ he ’s the sort of player you want in your team – he keeps the ball , works hard and you can rely on him			0
he ’s been a massive part of what @entity8 have done this season			2
’ @entity4 enjoyed two years on @entity82 before being pictured supporting @entity8 at the 1999 fa cup final wearing a t - shirt that read ' @entity85 * * * * * * s '			1
the t - shirt was , in fact , thrown over him by a supporter and the photo snapped in a flash			0
the incident forced him to quit @entity9 for @entity91			2
nonetheless , he has no regrets about making the move to the @entity94			0
‘ the group of players and the manager , @entity98 , made it easy for me when i went there , ’ he said			0
@entity4 says @entity10 has won the @entity8 fans over by producing excellent performances @entity10 made 135 appearances for the @entity9 scoring five goals , including against @entity8 last season @entity10 will come up against his former team - mates for the first time on sunday ‘ they were first - class and i had a great couple of years			1
we reached the play - off final in my first season then won the @entity114 with a record points total the year after , and i played a big part in that			0
’ @entity4 – a former @entity42 schoolboy captain and under - 21 regular – was included in full squads but never made his senior debut			1
@entity10 , meanwhile , was called up by @entity120 in august only to withdraw because of injury and has n’t been involved since			0
that , however , will change before the season is out says @entity4			0
‘ without a doubt he is good enough to get back in , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity120 obviously liked him earlier in the season and he ’s probably playing better now			0
i think @entity10 should be aiming for another call - up			0
for me , it would be deserved			0
