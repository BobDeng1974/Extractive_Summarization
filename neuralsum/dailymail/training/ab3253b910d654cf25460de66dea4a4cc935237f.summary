it ’s one of the age - old questions that has haunted mankind for eons : would you rather give up @entity5 and pocket $ 1,000 , or keep using the social network without any monetary reward ? fortunately digital @entity8 is on the case – they surveyed 1,000 people and quizzed them on a variety of scenarios in the ultimate game of ‘ would you rather ? ’ their questions revolve around how much money it would take to persuade them to perform one of 23 ' unpleasant tasks ' from travelling on a one - way trip to @entity21 to living with 50 cats for a year			1
@entity23 urveyed 1,000 people to see what they 'd do in a 23 different ' would you rather ' scenarios			1
the questions ranged from how much money someone would take to go on a one - way trip top @entity21 to whether they 'd be willing to give up @entity5 for a year - at a price the survey was inspired by the aforementioned game of ‘ would you rather ? ’ where people ‘ love to push their limits and imagine what it would take to do something crazy , ’ the firm said			1
no facebook for a year - $ 1,000 ( £ 600 ) clean roadkill for a year - $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) become a radio tower repairman for a year - $ 1 million ( £ 600,000 ) shave entire body - $ 5.5 million ( £ 3.3 million ) @entity48 like @entity49 - $ 5.5 million ( £ 3.3 million ) eat a doughnut from the @entity52 floor - $ 10 million ( £ 6 million ) live with 300 spiders for three weeks - $ 100 million ( £ 60 million ) ‘ you ’d probably say a significant amount of money could get you to do something bizarre - but just how much ? ’ that was the crux of the @entity60 survey and some of the results were surprising to say the least			2
one of the questions was the minimum amount of money the participants would accept to give up @entity5 for a year			1
according to the survey 22.9 per cent of males 55 to 64 years old said they would n’t stop using the social network even for over $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) a year - but 26.7 per cent of females aged 18 to 24 said they ’d do it for just a dollar ( 60p )			0
meanwhile women were apparently more addicted to coffee than men , but both genders were less willing to give it up as they got older			0
above are the results of the various questions that were posed to 1,000 people , with the number of people who answered directly below the percentages @entity23 says that some of the results were quite surprising			1
for example , men were more likely to give up coffee than women , while older people were generally quite reticent when it came to giving up digital services like @entity94 and @entity95 or social media networks like @entity5 most age groups were willing to give up video streaming services like @entity94 and @entity95 for a year if they were given less than $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) - except for men over 65 , where only 50 per cent said they ’d do it for that amount			1
meanwhile under two per cent of women said they ’d travel to @entity21 on a one - way trip for under $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) , compared to over 20 per cent of men aged 18 to 24			2
the company then also compiled the average amount of money people would do something for			0
the running of the bulls , for example , saw most female age groups refuse to do it for less than $ 55 million			0
men , meanwhile , would mostly do it for under $ 550,000 ( £ 330,000 ) and while women are thought to be more inclined to love cats than than men , it was the males who were more willing to live with 50 cats for a year for less money			2
some things , however , were too much for people to handle			0
when it came to swimming with sharks with no cage , or doing pullups from the top of a 20 - storey building , for most people there was no amount of money that would persuade them to do it			0
this flipbook shows various comparisons within the results , with some surprising conclusions from the survey			0
