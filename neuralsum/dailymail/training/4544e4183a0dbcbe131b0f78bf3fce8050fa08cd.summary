by @entity0 sir @entity1 took a massive gamble when he decided knock down his father 's opera house and build a state - of - the - art facility you may think that going to the opera at @entity9 is a relic from the days of @entity11 — an activity restricted to crumbling dukes in dinner jackets getting stuck into the champagne in between arias			1
it ’s true that it ’s expensive — £ 110 for the cheaper tickets to one of @entity22 ’s greatest operas , @entity20 , being performed this summer			1
but you could pay the same to watch a @entity24 game or see the @entity25 in concert			1
so you have to view the cost in context			0
for the price of a ticket , you get the best music in the world , in one of the world ’s greatest opera houses , and all in a beautifully unspoilt fold of the @entity37			2
and the black tie is optional			0
the unique feel of @entity9 is largely thanks to sir @entity1 , the man who took his father ’s charming little theatre and turned it into an international opera house — and a fixture of the @entity46 summer season			1
on paper sir @entity1 , who died earlier this week at 79 , looked pretty unremarkable			1
educated at @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 , he inherited the manor house at @entity9 from his father , @entity53			1
@entity53 was a @entity54 veteran , a former master at @entity49 and a @entity55 like his son — an unprecedented double			0
the house , a charming mishmash of @entity60 , 17th century , @entity62 and early 20th century styles , has been in the family since the early 17th century			2
the @entity64 can trace their lineage right back to @entity66 , the scantily dressed @entity68 noblewoman			0
but in truth , sir @entity1 was far from unremarkable			1
when you met him , the first thing that struck you was his size — only 5ft 2ins			0
his character , too — jolly , friendly , anarchic — was far removed from the stuffy clichés that cling to the opera world			2
he shared the family passion for pugs — he was even said to have been named after a favourite family pet — and the artists ’ pub at @entity9 is called the @entity81			1
when i met him a decade ago , at a summer party by the sea in @entity85 , he was wearing a sailor ’s hat at a jaunty angle , a bright - pink shirt and a smile as broad as the @entity91			2
but where he displayed the greatest radicalism was in the revolution he plotted for the family opera house			1
like a lot of seemingly ancient @entity99 traditions , @entity9 opera is n’t really that old			1
@entity53 came up with the idea in 1934 ( one of many sadnesses of sir @entity1 ’s death is that he did n’t get to see the opening of the 80th anniversary season on may 17 )			1
@entity53 built his little theatre as an indulgence for his wife , a soprano called @entity109			0
to begin with it sat 300 people			2
as it became more popular , it mushroomed : from 433 in 1936 to 600 in 1952			0
the festival , renowned for its ' posh picnics ' offers cheap tickets to under 30s for just £ 30 when sir @entity1 inherited @entity9 in 1962 , at only 27 , the place was still expanding			1
in 1977 its capacity increased to 850 people			2
he had to face financial reality — his father had run the opera house at a loss out of his own fortune ; the son could n’t afford such indulgence			1
for all @entity9 ’s charm , this gradual , haphazard growth meant the old theatre was , to be honest , a bit of a dog ’s dinner — a village hall with a crazy amount of extensions			1
things were done on the hoof , literally — stables became offices ; garages became rehearsal rooms ; outbuildings became scene docks			0
and so , in 1987 , sir @entity1 took the biggest gamble of his life			1
he decided to knock down his father ’s amateurish pride of joy and replace it with a state - of - the - art opera house that would rank with the great opera houses of the world			1
traditionalists were outraged — both at the demolition of @entity53 ’s old - fashioned theatre , and the construction of a daring design by husband - and - wife architects @entity161 and @entity162			0
in fact , the new opera house carefully bridged the gap between the old and new — as sir @entity1 did			1
like the manor house , it was built of brick , but was wrapped in copper , and the huge new metal fly tower soared over the mock - @entity172 windows of the old house			2
patrons at @entity9 can experience everything from old favourites to the obscure even the sceptics were bowled over , and it was soon listed as one of the most important grade i buildings of the @entity181			1
sir @entity1 drove a hard bargain , too			1
for £ 33 million , he got an opera house built in only seven years that some say should have cost £ 50 million			1
but still , the operas played to full houses			0
and when it came to money , sir @entity1 conducted a careful balancing act			1
he realised that the new commercial world meant sponsorship and corporate entertainment were crucial sources of support			0
he also understood that good opera cost big money			0
he had the honesty to admit that the best opera ‘ is always going to be elitist : there ’s no point pretending anything else ’			0
admittedly , the corporate types are in evidence at @entity9 — sometimes more interested in being seen than in seeing the opera			1
but 30 per cent of the seats are retained for the public , and there are special deals if you sign up as an associate member			0
a fashionable woman on her way to @entity9 for a night at the opera the days when opera - goers brought their butlers are long gone			1
and young visitors are encouraged — i first went in my early 20s as a broke student , when i did n’t know a thing about opera , and fell in love with the place on the spot			0
today , under - 30s can get tickets for £ 30			0
and @entity9 operas are beamed live on the internet and into cinemas across the country			1
you can be a @entity232 kind of fan like me — whose tastes do n’t stretch much beyond @entity22 and @entity237 — or you can be a top - of - the - tree classical music aficionado			0
this year ’s @entity9 season includes the great crowd - pleaser @entity241 by @entity237 , and the more obscure @entity242 by @entity243			2
sir @entity1 always took risks with the programme — in 1990 , a modernist version of @entity22 ’s @entity248 was the first opera to be booed at @entity9			1
controversies have continued in recent years			0
in 2007 , @entity9 applied for a 70m - high wind turbine			2
it was so controversial in an area of outstanding national beauty that the government put planning permission on hold , before allowing the scheme in 2008			0
despite embracing modernity , sir @entity1 retained his father ’s dress code			1
but it was , in the words of the code , ‘ customary ’ not obligatory			0
no one stops you going in if you ’re not in the full gear			0
over the 20 years i ’ve been going to @entity9 , i ’ve worn some pretty ropy versions of black tie — particularly when i ’ve just cycled four miles from @entity271 , my shirt dripping with sweat , my tatty old dinner jacket squashed into a plastic bag			2
and no one ’s said a word or raised a disapproving eyebrow as i get changed in the car park			0
like most of the best @entity99 events , @entity9 is a glorious mix of the shabbily amateur and the slickly professional			2
yes , you can spend a fortune at the bar on overpriced champagne and upmarket food			0
but most @entity9 regulars come with their own homemade picnics — from a ham roll and a packet of cheese - and - onion crisps , to heaving baskets crammed with lobster and foie gras			2
you can eat what you want to eat , drink what you want to drink — again free from any stuffy restrictions or anything as wicked as a corkage charge			0
you can dine off china on a fold - up table or , as i ’ve done , lie in the long grass by the lake , dip one hand in the water and wrap the other around a plastic tumbler of warm white wine			0
formal but relaxed , classic but modern , international but thoroughly @entity46			0
you could say the same of @entity9 and its late , much lamented impresario .			2

going to the opera at @entity9 is no more expensive than a @entity24 *football* match or watching the @entity25
people no longer bring their butlers to the traditional summer festival
