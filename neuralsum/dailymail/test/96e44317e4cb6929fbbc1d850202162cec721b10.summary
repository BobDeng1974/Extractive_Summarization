this is the moment that two total strangers who could pass for identical twins came face to face for the first time			2
@entity6 , a 26 - year - old student and tv presenter , found her 29 - year - old doppleganger after she teamed up with two friends to launch a project called @entity11 the aim of the social media experiment was to see which of the three could find their closest lookalike within 28 days and it attracted submissions to their website ' twin - strangers.com from across the world			1
after their first meeting she said : ‘ i was ridiculously nervous about how i would react to meeting someone who looks like me			2
' for the duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her			2
i could n’t get over her face			0
‘ and some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , “ @entity37 that ’s my face ”			0
i ca n’t remember the number of times i said “ this is so freaky ”			2
‘ i would say @entity23 is the shyer of the two of us , ’ said miss @entity6			1
‘ but then you have to remember this was an even more surreal experience for her than it was for me			0
i ’m the weirdo that contacted @entity23 and asked her to meet me			1
’ uncanny : @entity6 , a 26 - year - old student from @entity28 ( left ) , found her ' twin stranger ' in @entity23 ( right ) , through a social media campaign she launched with friends ' for the entire duration of our encounter i pretty much stared at her			1
i could n’t get over her face , ' said @entity6 ( left ) miss @entity23 , who is currently in between jobs , has five sisters and a brother			1
miss @entity60 has two sisters , and both girls agree that none of their siblings look anywhere near as similar to them as they do to one another			1
since meeting , miss @entity60 and @entity68 - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on @entity70 ' constantly '			0
@entity23 ( right ) turned out to be a fellow @entity72 native who lived just an hour down the road from @entity6 ( left ) , making it easy for the pair to meet in real life and take some eerily twin - like photos together she added , ' some of the expressions she would pull i would think to myself or say aloud , " @entity82 that ’s my face " ' while miss @entity6 appears to have beaten her fellow @entity85 participants , 21 - year - old @entity86 and 22 - year - old @entity87 , hands down , the search is n't over until april 27			1
' i think i have a two , maybe three at a push who resemble me			0
but they 're definitely not as close a match as @entity23 to @entity6 , ' @entity90 said			1
' i 'm trailing further behind , ' admits @entity93			0
' must be a guy thing			0
they tend to be a bit too shy to participate			0
not sure if being originally from @entity97 has anything to do with it ! ' @entity6 ( right ) said she and @entity23 ( left ) got on ' very well ' as they both applied make - up before the shoot , swapping beauty tips and marvelling at their similarities ( pictured ) friends for life ? since meeting , @entity6 ( right ) and @entity23 ( left ) - who are both single - say they 've been chatting on @entity70 ' constantly ' feedback : shocked reactions to @entity23 and @entity6 's story have flooded in from far and wide challenge : @entity6 's ( right ) fellow @entity85 participants , 21 - year - old @entity86 ( left ) and 22 - year - old @entity87 ( centre ) , are still looking for their doppelgängers , and the search is n't over until april 27 miss @entity6 , who is still promoting the project across social media with @entity86 and @entity87 as interest spreads , says there will be no prize for the winner , just ' pride '			1
they are inviting others from around the world to join in too now , by adding users ' photos to their @entity70 album			0
' there is a huge human curiosity element to it , ' she said			0
' can you imagine how surreal it would be to meet someone who looked exactly like you ? ' only last month the @entity137 revealed how retired priest @entity138 was greeted with waves and ‘ hello @entity144 ’ greetings when he moved to @entity141 , @entity142 , 18 months ago because residents mistook him for 74 - year - old lookalike @entity144 .			2

@entity6 , 26 , found her doppelgänger through social media
her lookalike , @entity23 , lives only a hour away in @entity72
the pair met in real life and although it was ' freaky ' , they got on very well
both have sisters , and say they do n't look similar to either of them
