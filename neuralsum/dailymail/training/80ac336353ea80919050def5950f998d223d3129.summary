@entity1 boss @entity0 insists @entity2 should also be classed as minnows if his newcomers to the big stage are to carry that tag			1
@entity8 's 54th full member nation will contest its second competitive game against the @entity10 in @entity11 on saturday evening having been trounced 7 - 0 by @entity12 in its first @entity14 qualifier last month			1
however , @entity0 bristles as the minnow tag despite his country boasting a population of less than 30,000 people and just 600 registered footballers , and used @entity20 hosts @entity2 's semi-final horror show against @entity22 to support his case			1
@entity1 prepare for @entity10 tie at @entity25 , @entity11 on friday asked about the argument that smaller nations should have to pre-qualify , he said : ' it 's something that keeps cropping up and i keep on asking the same question to all those people who keep on saying this : how do you judge a minnow ? ' do you judge it by the size of your country or by the results ? because of that was the case , then @entity2 would be a minnow because they lost 7 - 0			1
' we all deserve to be here and as long as we can give a good game , then why should we pre-qualify ? we are going in there and all of us have got to get ready			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 bristles at his country 's minnow tag ' every single manager that is with a national team and goes into a tournament should aim to reach what 's at the end of the tunnel , and that 's @entity60			1
' these arguments keep on coming up and to be honest with you , i am getting a bit tired of some of the big managers saying this			0
' i think what it is is they are scared of the the so - called minnows because of the results lately by the minnows			0
once they get a result against them , then they get stick			0
' like i say , @entity2 , they lost 7 - 0			1
should they be classed as a minnow now ? ' @entity1 were trounced 7 - 0 by @entity12 in their first @entity14 qualifier despite their heavy defeat by the @entity87 , it has not been all doom and gloom for @entity1 , who tasted victory over @entity92 in just their fifth match , and have also recorded draws against @entity94 and @entity95			1
but there are only two full - time players among their ranks with the remainder of the squad made up of part - timers including policemen , firefighters and students			0
captain @entity105 too insists they deserve their chance to rub shoulders with the big boys and even at the age of 31 is relishing the opportunity to learn			0
he said : ' we all want to play against the best players in the world			0
for example , we played @entity12 where we faced @entity115 and we realised the gap between he as an individual and ourselves			2
' you do learn - i have learnt so much just from that one game			2
i am 31 now now , but if i had had that opportunity , say , when i was 18 , from 18 to what i am , 10 years playing at that level , how much a better player i would have become			0
' @entity125 - born defender @entity105 , a customs officer by trade , admitted the preparations for the clashes with @entity10 and @entity129 over the next few days are as close as he will get to being a professional , and he is determined to enjoy every second of it			2
he said : ' it 's completely different			0
right now for me , this week is as close as i am going to get to being a professional football player			0
' back home in @entity1 with our full - time jobs and putting training in between as well , it 's very hard , so being able to be here and just concentrate on football makes things a lot easier and is what we dream about			1
