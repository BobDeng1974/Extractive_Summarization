a flagship project launched by the prime minister is under investigation for allegedly misusing funds from taxpayers ' money and charity pots to to pay off its directors and settle debts			0
the beleaguered @entity9 , which @entity10 launched with huge fanfare in 2010 , has already been criticised for its dud projects , which were allegedly only approved because officials were pressured to change the rules			1
and now the @entity15 has launched its own probe into payments for ' consultancy ' to a @entity20 donor and allegations huge payouts meant for doing good in the community were siphoned off to pay off creditors			1
the @entity9 is a favour project of prime minister @entity10 , pictured above at an event in 2011 the payments were allegedly made to two directors of the charity and its chair @entity33 , a @entity20 donor , the @entity29 reported			1
the revelations have prompted @entity35 to call for a separate probe into allegations that charity officials were pressured to favour the government 's ' pet projects '			1
news of the probe came days after a public spending watchdog issued a separate critical report about how @entity46 and @entity40 funds were handed over to and used by the @entity9			1
shadow civil society minister @entity47 said she was now asking the cabinet secretary to investigate whether ' political pressure ' was exerted to secure money for ministers ' ' pet projects '			1
the @entity9 was launched by @entity10 at 10 downing street two months after winning power in 2010 , with the aim of encouraging the kind of community work and volunteering			1
' inappropriate ' : it has been alleged that charity officials were pressured to wave through ' pet projects ' but the performance of many of the projects it ran has been heavily criticised and the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) exposed problems with how £ 2million worth of grants were handed over to it			1
the @entity64 said the @entity68 failed to challenge @entity9 's ' ambitious ' target to recruit a million members a year to one initiative despite meeting the target being crucial to its success			1
the @entity75 was given an £ 830,000 lottery grant but eventually managed to attract just 64 members			0
the grant was also allowed to be transferred to a new company set up by the @entity9 chairman and another director , without checking it had the it skills to make the scheme work , the @entity64 said			1
its report also found that the £ 300,000 childhood obesity grant was made ' contrary to the @entity89 's own guidelines ' and even though the @entity90 did not meet its criteria for funding			2
the officials were allegedly told to ' go back and change the criteria ' the funding was halted after £ 200,000 had been handed over because of the project 's poor performance , and the @entity89 did not recoup any of the funds			0
calls : @entity35 mp @entity47 has called for an investigation into the @entity9 a @entity15 spokeswoman confirmed that it was examining the @entity9 's awarding and use of funds			1
' our case into the @entity107 remains open and on going , ' she said			0
' we have received a response to questions we had relating to connected party transactions and the use of a grant however this does not fully address our concerns and we are in the process of engaging further with the trustees			0
' we are also awaiting copies of documents that explain the grounds on which a grant was given			0
' mr @entity33 , who contributed more than £ 54,000 to the 2010 @entity20 election campaign , said he did not recall the payment from the @entity9 but said that it was possible that ' one of my companies did work on its behalf '			2
he said he put £ 200,000 of his own money into the @entity9 which he had not got back and defended its operations			2
' with hindsight , of course , if we had all known that the projects were not going to work we would have been idiots to do them , ' he said			0
' in the early stages of social investment some will work and some wo n't			0
' in a further blow to the @entity9 , a former trustee of a grants body claimed it was ' forced ' to approve £ 480,000 of applications from the @entity9 without asking for a pitch			2
the sum was given to the @entity9 by innovation funders @entity142 without a competitive pitch			2
@entity142 is now a private charity but was a government body at the time			0
former trustee @entity146 said the awards were a ' scandalous waste of money '			0
@entity142 told @entity150 : ' while the vast majority of @entity142 's grants are made following open calls for proposals , we do have the ability to provide grants to projects that fit with our vision and advance our objects outside of open calls for proposals			0
' that is what happened with the grants to the @entity9			2
@entity142 did not fund any of the projects highlighted in the @entity64 report			2
' ms @entity47 said the entire @entity9 project ' lies in tatters ' and called for an investigation			1
' it 's bad enough that millions of pounds of public money were squandered , but the connections between these organisations and the conservative party are deeply concerning , ' she said			0
' i am writing to cabinet secretary @entity177 to ask him to investigate the process by which the grants in question were given			0
' we must know if political pressure was applied to give an organisation with close ties to @entity186 special treatment			1
' at a time when many charities are fighting to survive , handing out large sums of money to flawed , pet projects is inexcusable			1
' a @entity89 spokesman said : ' the awarding of this grant has been the subject of intensive investigation by @entity89 and independently by the @entity64			0
' both investigations found no rules were broken and the matter is now closed			0

@entity9 is under investigation by @entity15
had already been criticised for *expensive* projects which did n't meet aims
earlier report alleged projects only funded because of political pressure
@entity35 has called for inquiry into allegations over ' pet projects '
