it was just as well they got the fireworks out the way before the game , because even after an explosive start and some quite extraordinary rugby any hope @entity8 had of having something to celebrate had this amazing habit of quickly disappearing here on saturday night			1
that opening try from @entity13 , scored after less than 90 seconds , invited @entity8 and their expectant supporters to dream			2
from @entity15 came a gushing , confident response			0
@entity8 would not only win the game , he declared , but they would do so in the style he once displayed on a rugby pitch			2
it was an understandable reaction but it did not take into account @entity8 's ability under @entity25 to too often blow these opportunities			1
they should have nailed @entity28 last week , as the @entity29 did at @entity30 on saturday , and their failure to do so cost them dear in the end			2
@entity8 captain @entity33 ( right ) wanders off the @entity35 pitch after his country 's win @entity8 lock @entity38 appears dejected as he trudges off the pitch after the final whistle @entity8 's players , including @entity41 ( right ) , look dejected after conceding a crucial try to @entity43 if @entity25 likened the challenge his side might be facing on this most absorbing afternoon of international rugby to the @entity48 , he no doubt hoped his side would not need to pull off their own miracle of @entity51			1
but a 26 - point winning advantage against @entity43 , even this @entity43 , seemed like a pretty tall order and so it proved			1
no sooner had they secured seven points than they were nursing the bruises of two @entity58 tries , @entity60 's side punishing @entity8 for a lack of precision as well as patience			1
a lack of discipline too , summed up by the foolishness of @entity67 in what became an utterly insane try fest. that @entity8 then responded the way they did made it a highly entertaining spectacle			2
the try @entity13 scored after 35 minutes was a beauty , the move @entity8 put together covering the full length of the @entity35 pitch			1
@entity13 goes over the line to give @entity8 an early lead in their must - win @entity79 clash @entity81 star @entity13 jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on saturday evening @entity43 's @entity85 responded to @entity13 ' early try with one of his own after a 40 - yard dash but those early lapses in concentration as they chased that points total were so damaging to @entity8 's ambitions of securing a first @entity79 championship under @entity95 , with a 24 - point victory still required after more than half an hour and 14 at half - time			1
within three minutes of the second half they needed 21			0
there were moments when they were close			0
with four minutes remaining they needed just one converted try			0
but @entity95 will have to reflect on that period of the first half â€“ as well as certain spells after the break - when they allowed @entity43 to look like their old selves and examine in detail where improvements still need to be made			1
with six months remaining until the start of the @entity114 , @entity25 is sure to focus on some of the positives too			2
the fact that they beat @entity118 in @entity119 and @entity120 here last autumn certainly bodes well for those group exchanges			0
as does the emergence of players like @entity124 and other individual performances			0
but is this a team that can seriously make the most of home advantage and secure a second @entity114 in 12 years ? the evidence right now would suggest not , even if the detail in @entity95 's preparation extends to involving the players ' partners in trying to win the tournament later this year			1
@entity38 is grabbed by his shirt as @entity43 's players let their frustrations boil over @entity8 's @entity38 gets caught up in a scuffle with four @entity43 players as tempers flare during the first half @entity43 's @entity142 scores a controversial try after getting away from @entity13 during the first half in 2003 @entity8 were the complete team			1
dominant against their northern hemisphere rivals and quite clearly equipped to conquer all on the opposite side of the world			0
and they believed it too , with such confidence a crucial quality for any team with serious ambitions			0
but @entity8 in 2015 ? they can play some wonderful rugby with a nice combination of power and pace			2
but are they clinical enough ? are they robust enough ? and do they really believe that anything is possible ? anything seemed possible here on saturday in this insane contest ; one that saw 12 excellent tries and some marvellous running rugby			0
@entity163 set the tone with the thumping intervention that led to the opening @entity13 try and what followed was a breathless 80 minutes of action to round off a remarkable climax to the championship			0
the balance of power on the pitch as well as on the final table swung violently			0
a missed kick from @entity174 and a converted kick for the @entity58 from @entity176 and suddenly the challenge looked all the more insurmountable for @entity8 again ; and nigh on impossible once an unforced error had invited @entity179 to run in a try that knocked the stuffing not only out of @entity8 but an expectant , excited @entity35 crowd			1
@entity8 's @entity124 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity43 duo @entity185 ( left ) and @entity186 captain @entity33 bursts forward as @entity8 chase a big win to beat @entity190 to the @entity79 title @entity13 caps a brilliant first - half performance with his second try of the match and @entity8 's third a second @entity58 try , one @entity142 so nearly contrived to mess up , compounded @entity8 's early misery			1
the @entity58 were running the ball like the @entity43 teams of yesteryear			2
like the teams @entity60 once represented rather than coached			0
@entity8 would come back valiantly , running in tries with a frequency that have @entity35 daring to dream again			1
but @entity185 would score for @entity43 and so too would @entity186 , the giant @entity58 prop exploiting an @entity8 team caught out by their own desperation to score big			1
with @entity163 's try came a renewed sense of optimism			0
@entity8 were eight points from glorious victory			2
but then came another @entity58 try , arriving so rapidly the @entity214 managed to award five points to both teams			0
in fairness to the host broadcaster , the confusion was understandable			0

@entity8 lost on the @entity79 title by just six points on saturday
@entity25 's men beat @entity43 55 - 35 but it was *n't* enough
@entity8 failed to drive home their advantage at @entity35
