by @entity0 for @entity1 a couple has revealed they were offered baby @entity4 , the @entity5 boy who was caught in the middle of an international surrogacy scandal , by the same agency @entity4 's @entity10 parents used			1
the @entity11 has revealed the extreme measures that @entity13 and @entity14 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , as well as the @entity18 agency , considered using to ' get rid ' of the unwanted infant			1
it has been revealed the agency tried to give @entity4 to @entity22 and @entity23 , also from @entity16 , who had been struggling to conceive a child for years and had turned to @entity27 surrogacy officials for help			1
they have always denied abandoning him , insisting they were forced to flee with his healthy twin sister , @entity41 , before @entity27 authorities tightened surrogacy laws			1
ms @entity30 told @entity11 ' we contacted probably at least a dozen agencies over here ( in @entity47 ) before we went with this one because this one was - well , it had an @entity50 owner , which we thought we ’d be safe with , and it said clearly on their website that their doctors had been , some of their doctors had been , trained through @entity58			0
' the @entity59 's were clients of @entity18 for two years when they received an email from the company asking if they wanted @entity4 , according to the @entity11 's 7.30 program			2
' the email asked us if we wanted the baby ourselves			0
my assumption of why i was asked or why we were asked is because of the fact that we had been through this clinic for two years and without a successful pregnancy and maybe they thought this was an easy option for us to take this child instead of continuing on our path to have our own biological child			0
' that ’s just my opinion ' she said , ' but of course we ca n’t accept someone else 's child			0
' we did see it as a genuine offer to have the baby			0
we were mortified , could not believe that someone would go through a process like this and give birth to a beautiful baby boy , regardless of if he had down syndrome or not – he is their flesh and blood			2
' the @entity59 couple are now proud parents of four week old @entity31 , born via a @entity27 surrogate and egg donor			0
@entity30 says she was ' mortified ' by the way the @entity14 family had treated the baby an employee of @entity101 says @entity102 ( right ) wanted to abandon @entity4 ' outside a temple ' the @entity59 couple said the offer was one of several proposals from @entity50 @entity108 , the boss of @entity101 , who has gone to ground since the story went global			1
the @entity11 reported that mr @entity108 denies any knowledge of @entity4 being offered to another @entity10 couple and he is shocked by the suggestion			1
the @entity11 also spoke with a colleague of mr @entity108 , who said that the baby 's biological father mr @entity102 had asked for the baby to be bleft outside a @entity27 temple			2
' he did not want the baby			0
he just wanted to do anything so that he would not have that baby , ' she said			0
mr @entity102 has previously denied that he wanted the child aborted			2
the surrogacy worker alleges he asked : ' there is a normal one , can i take the normal one ? ' can you leave the abnormal one at the temple ? can you leave him in @entity35 ? nobody will know about this ' she says the company denied his proposal , and reportedly showed an email to @entity11 which showed mr @entity108 said : ' they beg me to drop baby @entity4 at the temple at night and run away			1
they told me , ' do n't worry , @entity141 , the monk will take care of the baby			0
' @entity108 , who owns @entity101 , ( centre ) denies his company offerred @entity147 to the @entity59 couple @entity22 and @entity23 say they were offered @entity147 by @entity101 , but the owner of the company @entity108 denies the claim			1

@entity22 and @entity23 , who have been trying for years for a baby , say the @entity101 agency offered to give them @entity4
@entity13 and @entity14 caused international outrage when they were *accused* of leaving the @entity5 boy in @entity101 but took healthy twin @entity162 home to @entity16
@entity101 boss @entity164 denies he offerred @entity147 to the couple
an employee of @entity101 also claimed @entity102 , a *convicted* *sex* *offender* , wanted to abandon @entity4 ' outside a temple '
he and his wife @entity170 have denied abandoning the now eith month old
