by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 6 may 2013 the drive to tear up planning laws is not working and the government is actually introducing even more red tape , a report claims			1
ministers have repeatedly promised to relax the rules around new homes , extensions and larger developments to boost economic growth			0
but a right - leaning think tank say the @entity13 have brought in nearly twice as many new regulations as @entity16 's government			1
the @entity17 said the @entity13 have brought in nearly twice as many new planning regulations as @entity16 's government the authors say this failure to speed up planning explains persistently high house prices in @entity23 , slow construction of much - needed new homes and delays to major infrastructure projects			1
in a damning analysis , the @entity17 conclude : ' the result is an unnecessarily lengthy and costly planning procedure which enables vested interests to prosper , creates commercial uncertainty and restricts new development			1
' when they analysed planning laws over a six month period in 1997 , the first year under the new @entity36 government , there were 150 new regulations introduced			2
but in the first half of 2011 , after the @entity13 pledged to get to grips with a bonfire of planning rules , the government introduced 278			2
the authors say no other sector of the @entity23 economy is as shackled by regulation as the property and construction sector , which has traditionally been highly centralised			2
however they say despite the ' localism ' agenda pursued by the @entity13 to give councils greater control over development in their area , progress is still too sluggish			0
the authors say this failure to speed up planning explains persistently high house prices in @entity23 they say the agenda is dominated by ' special interest groups ' who oppose development on the green belt such as the @entity66 , the @entity67 and @entity68			1
many local authorities also ' resist development whether of an economic or residential character ' , the report says , although they concede the government is cracking down on those not building enough homes			0
at last year 's @entity77 , the prime minister said : ' there 's something else we need to do – and that 's accept we need to build more houses in @entity23 '			0
he added : ' for a business to expand , it needs places to build			0
if it takes too long , they 'll just build elsewhere			0
' the report calls for ' sunset clauses ' on planning regulation – automatically reviewing them after five years ; and more to be torn up , to end the ' lawyer 's banquet ' of regulations			2
they add that the planning system needs to operate on a more ' market based ' approach looking at economic gains , like other countries , from @entity99 to @entity100 , where planning permission for development is far quicker			0
it also recommends the government look at building @entity105 modelled on @entity106 , that have housing but also jobs , parks , shops and leisure facilities			0
@entity112 , director of the @entity17 said : ' the @entity13 is right to have identified the complexity of the current planning system as a major obstacle to growth			1
' it should learn from the historic success of @entity106 and the plans for a new @entity119 at @entity120 to see how implementing real reform can free up the planning process to the great benefit of both would - be homeowners and the wider economy			1

damning analysis comes from right - leaning @entity17
authors say failure to speed up planning explains high house prices
