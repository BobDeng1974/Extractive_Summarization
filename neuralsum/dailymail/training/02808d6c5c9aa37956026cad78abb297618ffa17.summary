we will find intelligent life on other planets within 25 years , the man behind one of the world 's most advanced searches for alien life has predicted			1
@entity8 of the @entity9 ( @entity10 made the claim at a @entity13 conference looking at advanced technologies			1
he believes the key is to keep scanning the skies looking for alien - produced electromagnetic signals			1
the @entity18 -- named for @entity20 co-founder @entity19 , who put up $ 11.5 million for the project , was one of the first dedicated @entity9 telescopes			1
it now says it believes we will make contactwithin 25 years			2
@entity8 told the conference the hunt for alien life was a three way race			2
the players are : ' i think we 'll find @entity32 within two dozen years using these sorts of experiments , ' @entity8 said at the 2014 @entity35 ( @entity35 ) symposium at @entity37			0
' instead of looking at a few thousand star systems , which is the tally so far , we will have looked at maybe a million star systems ' 24 years from now , @entity8 said			0
' a million might be the right number to find something			0
' ' the bottom line is , like one in five stars has at least one planet where life might spring up , ' @entity8 told the conference			1
' that 's a fantastically large percentage			0
' that means in our galaxy , there 's on the order of tens of billions of @entity56 - like worlds			0
' the search for alien signals started in 1960 , when pioneering astronomer @entity59 scanned two sun - like stars with an 85 - foot - wide ( 26 meters ) @entity63 antenna			1
it has ramped up considerably over the past half - century , as astronomers have taken advantage of significant advances in electronics and digital technology			0
however , @entity9 has repeatedly warning it needs more cash to continue the search			1
the 24 - year estimate , for example , ' depends on continued @entity9 funding , which is in dire straits right now , ' he told @entity76 after his talk at the @entity35 symposium			2
researchers say that funding to use radio telescopes such as @entity81 ( pictured ) is key to their research @entity8 told the conference the hunt for alien life was a three way race between researchers looking for advanced , intelligent civilizations ; scientists scouring solar - system bodies such as @entity91 and @entity93 's @entity92 for simple organisms ; and researchers focusing on finding signs of microbial life on nearby exoplanets using future instruments such as @entity35 's $ 8.8 billion @entity99 , which is scheduled to launch in 2018			0
' i think any of these horses has a pretty good chance of succeeding — just my opinion — a pretty good chance of succeeding in the next 20 years , say , ' he said during the @entity35 talk .			0

@entity9 boss *pledges* ' we will find et '
claims one in five stars has at least one planet where life might spring up
believes many will have developed the *capability* to send electromagnetic signals out into the cosmos
