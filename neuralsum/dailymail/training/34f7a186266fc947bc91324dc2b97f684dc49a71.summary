at just eight days old , she had her left kidney removed			1
she underwent numerous operations and suffered from kidney disease but despite her ill health she 's always been determined to lead as normal a life as possible			1
@entity15 says : ‘ she was so gutsy and faced life head on			1
her health problems did n’t stop her doing anything			1
‘ aged four she ’d been in hospital five months having the lump removed from her back and bone grafts			2
when she came home our mum caught us both sliding down the stairs in a suitcase			0
‘ she ’d climb trees , ride a bike , did everything i did			0
and our bond was amazing , we ’d giggle with each other constantly			0
@entity15 says that even as children she was ' so protective of her ( @entity20 ) that when i was six i promised that she could have one of my kidneys if ever she needed it ' ‘ but i was so protective of her and and when i was six i promised that she could have one of my kidneys if ever she needed it			1

@entity15 says : ‘ it was fantastic seeing her in love			2
but then her sparkle began to fade			0
she was getting slower and said she felt groggy			0
it was n’t like her to complain			0
’ at the time @entity20 and @entity126 were running a pub but had to give up because of @entity20 ’s failing health			1
then in july last year @entity126 had to rush her to @entity133 at their local hospital , @entity135 , in @entity136			0
there doctors delivered the shattering news that @entity20 had kidney failure			1
@entity15 says : ‘ she ’d lost so much weight where she was being sick all the time and she looked so ill and grey			2
when the doctors said her remaining kidney was only functioning at eight percent i knew she was dying			2
‘ it was unbearable seeing the life draining out of my beautiful sister			2
’ @entity20 was referred to @entity25 ’s @entity24 and began dialysis			2
she was also put on the transplant list - but with no guarantees of a donor			0
their paternal grandfather , @entity153 , had died from kidney failure just six years earlier			1
but @entity15 stepped in to keep her childhood promise			2
she says : ‘ i told her not to worry , that she could have one of mine			0
i ’d always meant what i ’d said and i was n’t going to back out now			0
’ a blood test was carried out to see if she was match			0
but in 2004 @entity15 had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia , which causes muscle pain and in the years that followed she ’d suffered other unexplained symptoms			2
she says : ‘ i came up in itchy hives all over my body and i suffered from so much pain and exhaustion that for a long time i could barely leave the house			0
if i did i needed a wheelchair to get around			0
‘ @entity15 ( left ) , now 35 , jokes that she will now be taking the pee out of her sister @entity16 , now 33 ( right ) her symptoms left doctors baffled			1
at first they thought they were down to a post-viral infection , then their thoughts turned to a connective tissue disorder			0
but @entity15 ’s blood tests came back clear and after a few years the symptoms diminished considerably			2
however , because of her medical past , her application to donate was refused			2
@entity15 says : ‘ the bottom felt out of my world			0
worse still , @entity20 had seen the medical notes - which revealed that the blood test i ’d had proved i was perfect match			1
‘ it was unbearable , there i was carrying the one thing that could save @entity20 ’s life yet i was unable to give it to her			1
’ @entity20 ’s fiance @entity126 was tested and four of their friends , but none proved a match			1
but @entity15 refused to just sit back			0
she began an online blog about @entity20 and why she needed a kidney			1
she says : ‘ i decided if i could n’t help her then i wanted to find someone who could			0
’ keeping it humorous , her blog exploded - as it was tweeted it went viral global - sent on by a host of stars , including comedian @entity13			0
@entity15 says : ‘ he sent his best wishes and retweeted the link to his 4.5 million followers - spreading the word about @entity20			1
other celebrities became involved , including @entity217 , @entity218 and some of the @entity220 cast			0
would - be donors ended up jamming the hospital renal unit ’s switchboard			0
then in october 2012 one doctor reviewed @entity15 ’s medical notes , deciding that her unexplained symptoms were part of her fibromyalgia and nothing more sinister			1
he concluded her condition may not prevent her from becoming a possible donor			0
@entity15 says : ‘ i was ecstatic , now was my chance to save @entity20 but i did n’t realise it was only the first hurdle			1
’ for the next five months @entity15 had to fight her corner , trying to convince other medics that she was suitable and that she accepted the risks attached			0
all the time @entity20 struggled on , as dialysis became less effective - yet without it she ’d be dead within two weeks			0
but finally @entity15 managed to convince every single one of them			0
last stop was her husband @entity241 and their children @entity242 , 16 and @entity245 , 14			0
@entity15 says : ‘ they were so scared for me but i tried to reassure them and said it was just something i had to do , that i could n’t live with myself if i did n’t do all i could to save @entity20			1
’ @entity15 sailed through the normal series of tests			1
and five months ago she was able to give her sister the gift of life as the transplant was carried out at @entity24 via a keyhole procedure			1
@entity15 even asked for a picture to be taken of her kidney before it was given into @entity20			1
she says : ‘ as a big sister i ’d always looked after @entity20 and i ’d made that promise when we were little			2
‘ when they wheeled her back up onto the ward next to me and i saw her catheter filling up it was the best sight in the world - my kidney was doing its job , the transplant had worked			0
’ @entity20 adds : ‘ ‘ what @entity15 ’s done is truly amazing , i ’m now back on my feet and i 've never felt so good			1
she ’s literally given me life and i ’ll never be able to thank her enough			0
