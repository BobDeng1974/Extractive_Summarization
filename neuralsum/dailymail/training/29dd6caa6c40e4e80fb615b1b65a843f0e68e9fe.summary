by @entity0 published : 09:38 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 16:53 est , 11 october 2012 another week , and another set of barely believable unemployment figures			1
a crucial government report released today showed a dramatic drop in the number of people filing jobless claims to the lowest level since february 2008			2
but it soon emerged one major state 's figures were n't added to the total			1
the @entity13 administration hailed a shock drop of 30,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000 , but one @entity16 official let slip that the figures may have fallen because the state , not officially named failed to turn over its figures which in turn were not added to the report			1
just last week monthly unemployment figures showed a shock fall which led some , including former ceo of @entity26 @entity25 to claim that they were ' downright implausible ' and issued to improve @entity13 's economic record just ahead of the election			1
this graph shows that the weekly unemployment insurance claims have dropped to their lowest level since february 2008 some experts have speculated that the omitted state is @entity35 and it will surely add to the growing perception that unemployment figures ca n't be trusted			1
@entity25 created a furore last week when he tweeted that the sharp drop in the unemployment rate was ' unbelievable " and that @entity13 and his campaign aides ' will do anything ... ca n't debate so change numbers '			1
on the jobs figures , which were above 8 per cent for @entity13 's entire term until friday , @entity25 said in a piece in the @entity47 yesterday that there was a strong possibility of ' subjectivity creeping into the process '			1
' the economy is not in a free - fall			1
oil and gas are strong , automotive is doing well and we seem to be seeing the beginning of a housing comeback			2
but i doubt many of us know any businessperson who believes the economy is growing at breakneck speed , as it would have to be for unemployment to drop to 7.8 % from 8.3 % over the course of two months			1
' he accused the @entity13 campaign of being disingenuous and the media of being its lapdogs			1
the mystery state did report their weekly jobless claims , but did not process in time the quarterly claims , which is when people re-apply for benefits for administrative reasons as opposed to having recently lost their job			1
because the state did not hand in the higher quarterly numbers , there was n't the expected spike in claims that normally occurs at the start of a quarter but in fact , a fall			1
this also means that should the state file their full and correct figures in time for next week , the tally of jobless claims is likely to rise next week , negating any good news from today			1
but @entity35 ' provided all required ' claims data on a ' timely ' basis to the @entity16 , @entity95 , a spokesman for @entity35 â€™s @entity97 , said in an e-mail to @entity99			2
job applicants wait for the opening of the @entity102 in @entity103 , @entity104 as the @entity106 unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent last month , dropping below 8 percent for the first time in nearly four years initially the figures were seen as a boost to president @entity13 's re-election effort			1
they showed the number of @entity106 seeking unemployment aid surprisingly plummeted last week to a seasonally adjusted 339,000 , the lowest level since february 2008			1
the sharp drop , if sustained , could signal a stronger job market			2
the fall was a shock to analysts and investors and offered a hopeful sign that the job market could be picking up as firms feel confident enough to keep workers in employment			1
the news has come the week after the unexpectedly upbeat and widely questioned september employment report from the @entity128 which showed unemployment falling below eight percent for the first time since president @entity13 entered the @entity131			1
the @entity16 said on thursday that weekly applications fell by 30,000 to the fewest since february 2008			0
the four - week average , a less volatile measure , dropped by 11,500 to 364,000 , a six - month low			1
weekly applications are a proxy for layoffs			0
they can fluctuate sharply from week to week			1
if they stay near last week 's level , it would likely signal better hiring ahead			1
' the overall trend seems to be that the labor market is improving , ' said @entity144 , a currency strategist at @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147			0
however , the figures can also indicate that people are leaving the workforce entirely and no longer attempting to even find work anymore			2
when applications consistently drop below 375,000 , it suggests that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate			1
the @entity106 unemployment rate dropped to a near four - year low of 7.8 per cent in september , a potential boost to president @entity13 's re-election bid @entity161 , strategist at @entity162 in @entity163 , said ' you do have to be cautious about possible distortions			1
but with that caveat , the jobless claims numbers have been modestly encouraging over the last few weeks			0
' the positive figures follow a government surprisingly upbeat september employment report			2
the report said the unemployment rate fell in september to 7.8 percent , from 8.1 percent in august			2
it was the first time the rate had dropped below 8 percent since january 2009			0
taken with the unemployment figures the latest data has offered a hopeful sign that the moribund job market could pick up and provides mr. @entity13 with ammunition against @entity181 challenger @entity180 that his economic policies for recovery are bearing fruit			1
the unemployment rate declined because a government survey of households found that 873,000 more people had jobs , the biggest jump in nearly 10 years			2
an increase in part - time employment accounted for most of the gain			0
employers , meanwhile , added 114,000 jobs in september , according to a separate survey of businesses			0
and hiring over the summer was stronger than previously estimated			0
the economy gained an average of 146,000 jobs a month in the july - september quarter			2
that 's more than double the monthly pace in the april - june quarter			2
better - than - usual weather returned construction workers and others back to the job , and the end of some union - related labor strikes also reduced the number of jobless claims , some analysts said			2
still , hiring must be stronger to bring relief to the more than 12 million people who are unemployed			0
roughly 100,000 new jobs are needed each month to keep up with the working - age population			0
another report on wednesday suggested hiring will likely remain modest			0
employers posted slightly fewer open jobs in august compared with july , the @entity16 said			0
it was the second straight monthly drop and the fewest openings since april			0
a key problem is the economy is not growing fast enough to generate much hiring			0
growth slowed to a tepid annual rate of 1.3 percent in the april - june quarter , down from 2 percent in the previous quarter			2
most economists see growth staying at or below 2 percent in the second half of the year			0
on the trade front , exports dropped 1 % to $ 181.3 billion as demand for @entity106 - made cars and farm goods declined			0
imports edged down a slight 0.1 % to $ 225.5 billion as purchases of foreign - made autos , aircraft and heavy machinery fell			0
the cost of oil imports rose sharply			0
@entity25 - the former ceo of @entity26 questioned the unemployment rate figures released last week and tweeted president @entity13 's administration had rigged the numbers a wider trade deficit acts as a drag on growth because it means the @entity106 is earning less on overseas sales of @entity106 - produced goods while spending more on foreign products			1
economic growth slowed to an annual rate of just 1.3 % in the april - june quarter , and most economists do n't expect the economy to grow by much more than 2 % at an annual rate the rest of the year			2
@entity106 manufacturers have been hampered by slumping economies in @entity264 , @entity265 and other key export markets			0
many @entity264 countries are recession			0
the region accounts for about one - fifth of @entity106 exports			0
the @entity271 this week projected global growth of just 3.3 % for the year and 3.6 % in 2013			2
the stunning turn around in the unemployment trend has led some to claim the books have been cooked after the @entity13 's debate disaster last week the number may sound respectable at first glance , but it takes into account what is expected to be a sharp drop in @entity265 's growth rate to well below 10 %			1
the downgrade from its july forecast reflected disappointing growth in the @entity106 , spreading recessions in @entity264 and a marked slowdown in @entity265			0
there have been some hopeful signs that the @entity106 economy is improving			0
@entity292 grew in september for the first time in four months , according to a closely watched survey from the @entity295			0
the growth was driven by a jump in new orders and more hiring			0
the unemployment rate declined to 7.8 percent in september , the lowest level since january 2009			2
it fell because of a huge increase in the number of people who said they found jobs			0
increases in major purchases show consumers gaining more confidence in the economy			2
auto sales rose 13 % last month from a year earlier to nearly 1.2 million			0
home sales have been posting solid gains , which have driven home prices higher			0
when home prices rise , people tend to feel wealthier and spend more freely			0
last week the national unemployment rate dropped to 7.8 per cent in september , edging below eight per cent for the first time in almost four years and handing president @entity13 's re-election hopes a potentially major boost			1
@entity106 @entity322 figures state that employers added 114,000 jobs in september as wages rose and more people started looking for work			1
in addition , 86,000 more jobs were created in july and august than first estimated			0
according to @entity335 of the @entity336 , however , if the labour participation rate had remained at the same rate as it was when @entity13 took office , the unemployment rate would be 10.7 per cent			1
the figures immediately prompted claims of political manipulation in the wake of a poor debate performance by @entity13 in @entity342			1
. these @entity345 guys will do anything			0
. ca n't debate so change numbers , ' tweeted @entity25 , former ceo of @entity26 .			1

the fall was a surprise to most analysts who suggest and came about because one major state failed to file their complete figures for the last quarter
comes one week after the @entity13 administration were accused by the former ceo of @entity26 @entity25 of ' cooking the books ' on lower than expected unemployment figures
