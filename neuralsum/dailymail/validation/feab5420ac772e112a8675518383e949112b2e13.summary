confirmed : @entity0 will take part in the three leaders ' debates during the election @entity0 has said he will take part in all three televised leaders ' debate during the election campaign - the day after @entity9 flatly refused			1
the @entity11 's campaign chairman @entity10 confirmed in a letter to broadcaster that mr @entity0 was prepared to appear			1
his willingness to appear is in stark contrast with that of mr @entity9 , who last night made it clear he was willing to do one seven - way debate at the end of march , but no more			1
meanwhile , the four broadcasters - the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - announced they will stick to their previously - announced plans for three debates during the election campaign			2
in a joint statement , the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven - way debate involving mr @entity9 , @entity11 's @entity0 , @entity30 of the @entity31 and the leaders of the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 on @entity20 on april 2			1
this would be followed by a second show on @entity19 featuring the same line - up on april 16 and a final one - on - one clash between the @entity42 and @entity11 leaders on @entity43 and @entity22 on april 30 - exactly a week before the may 7 election			2
they urged the prime minister to ' reconsider ' his refusal to take part in these shows			1
but mr @entity9 's chief spin doctor @entity50 said their response was ' disappointing ' and restated the prime minister 's ' final position ' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting march 23			1
in a speech to his party 's @entity60 conference mr @entity0 is expected to say : ' today the @entity62 has written to the broadcasters saying with or without @entity9 , i will be at the debates			1
' and every day up to these debates he [ mr @entity9 ] will be asked : what are you hiding from ? ' mr @entity0 is expected to use his conference speech to accuse mr @entity9 of ' duplicity ' and of trying to ' chicken out ' of the debates			1
he will say : ' this is what @entity9 used to say about tv election debates : that they were essential to our democracy			2
contrast : the @entity11 's confirmation is in contrast to @entity9 's refusal to take part ' chicken ' : mr @entity0 is expected to accuse the @entity83 leader of ' running away ' in his speech a @entity11 grand coalition could be needed after the election to stop the @entity35 holding the balance of power and provoking a constitutional crisis , a former conservative home secretary has said			1
@entity90 of @entity91 said a deal between the two largest parties could be necessary to ensure the ' continuing unity ' of the @entity95			0
the former @entity96 said such an agreement could avoid the ' nightmare ' of a minority @entity11 administration depending on @entity35 support to govern - something which could ' stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point '			2
writing in @entity108 , the former cabinet minister accepted that a deal between @entity9 and @entity0 was ' quite unthinkable ' at the moment , but pointed out it worked in @entity112			1
lord @entity90 argued : ' what is at risk is the continuing unity of the @entity95			0
in order to preserve that unity another way should be found			0
' this could be a joint government of the @entity11 and @entity83 parties : quite unthinkable at the moment , and at this time likely to be rejected by both of them - but this is what has happened in @entity112			2
' he said it would be possible for the two parties to find areas of agreement - defence , counter-terrorism , infrastructure investment in schools , road , rail and in the reform of skills training and energy - while more controversial manifesto promises would have to wait until 2018			0
lord @entity90 's intervention follows a warning from former prime minister sir @entity141 that the @entity35 would enter any deal with @entity11 with the ' overriding aim ' of ' prising apart ' the union			1
' that every country apart from @entity146 had them			0
' that he was n't going to have any feeble excuses to get out of debates			0
' and now he is doing everything he can to stop them			0
' and it is on the issue of leadership debates that @entity9 's duplicity has caught up with him			2
' he says this election is all about leadership , all about the choice between him and me , and when it comes to a debate between him and me , he 's running scared			0
' he 's running away			0
' i say to @entity9 : you can refuse to face the public , but you ca n't deny your record			2
' you can try to chicken out of the debates , but do n't ever again claim that you provide strong leadership			0
' you can try to escape the people 's debates , but you ca n't escape the people 's verdict			0
' he will add : ' when all people will see is an empty chair , his claims of leadership will be exposed as empty			0
' in a letter to mr @entity50 , the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if mr @entity9 decides not to take part - effectively ' empty - chairing ' the prime minister			1
but mr @entity50 replied : ' i made the prime minister 's final position clear in my last letter - he is willing to do a seven - way debate in the week beginning march 23			1
' clearly it is disappointing that you are not prepared to take him up on that offer			0
' i am ready to discuss at your convenience the logistics of making the debate we have suggested happen			0
' with neither side in the stand - off backing down , the debates are set to go ahead without mr @entity9 's participation .			1

@entity11 leader said he would take part after @entity9 flatly refused
number 10 said prime minister would only take part in seven - way debate
broadcasters *threaten* to go ahead with three leader debates regardless
mr @entity0 expected to say his rival is ' chickening out ' of debates today
