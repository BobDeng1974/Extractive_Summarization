workers in the @entity1 are more likely to develop depression after losing their jobs than those in @entity5			1
a new study has revealed job loss is associated with depressive symptoms both sides of the @entity10			0
but the effects are much stronger in @entity1 - perhaps due to less generous benefits systems , it has been suggested			1
@entity1 workers suffer more depression after losing their jobs than @entity5 ones do , research suggests the @entity19 study discusses how the ' @entity20 ' of 2008 caused significant job losses in both @entity5 and the @entity1 , with particularly strong consequences for older workers			2
among people aged 50 to 64 , unemployment rates rose from 3.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent in the @entity1 , and from 5.4 per cent to 6.15 per cent in the @entity26			0
the researchers speculate that iincome loss may have particularly devastating consequences for the retirement plans of older workers			0
prior evidence has also suggested job loss among older workers is associated with poorer health , increased substance abuse , and increased depression risk , they add			2
the study , led by @entity37 and published in the @entity38 , is the first to compare how these associations differ across countries			0
the researchers used data on 38,356 people from the @entity44 ( @entity45 ) and the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) covering the years 2004 to 2010			0
the findings could reflect the more generous benefits systems in @entity5 surveys were carried out via questionnaire face - to - face in @entity5 and over the phone in the @entity1 , and covered 13 @entity5 countries – including @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 - and the @entity1			1
at each interview , individuals were classified into four broad categories – employed , unemployed and looking for work , retired , or disabled			0
the reasons for job loss were also gathered - due to the worker 's firm or plant closing down , due to redundancy , or job loss for another reason			2
and the individuals ’ levels of depression were also recorded			0
the results showed overall job loss was associated with a 4.8 per cent increase in depression scores in the @entity1 , and a 3.4 per cent increase in @entity5			1
however , when job loss due to plant closure was looked at separately , depressive symptom scores increased by 28.2 per cent in the @entity1 as compared to 7.5 per cent in @entity5			1
the role of wealth also differed across the two regions			0
dr @entity37 said : ‘ in the @entity1 , the impact of job loss is significantly stronger for those with little or no wealth than for wealthier individuals and the impact of job loss due to plant closure was stronger than in @entity5			1
‘ in contrast , we observed significant but weaker effects of job loss on depressive symptoms in @entity5 , which were not modified by pre-existing levels of wealth			2
’ the researchers suggest the results could reflect the more generous benefits systems in @entity5 .			1

job loss linked to 4.8 ****%**** rise in depression in @entity1 , and 3.4 ****%**** rise in @entity5
when job loss is due to plant closure depression increases 28 ****%**** in the @entity1
in this *situation* , depression scores increase by 7.5 ****%**** in @entity5
this could be because of more generous benefits systems in @entity5
