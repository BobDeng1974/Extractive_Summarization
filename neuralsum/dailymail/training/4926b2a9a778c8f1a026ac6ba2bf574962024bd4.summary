by @entity0 for @entity1 a 12 - year - old girl who underwent life - saving gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs following brain tumor surgery has returned to school 50lbs lighter			1
@entity5 , who now enjoys activities including swimming again , told @entity7 that she feels ' reborn ' and grinned for pictures ahead of her first day back in a classroom in almost two years			1
but while she has shed 50lbs and reversed her diabetes , there are still struggles ; she has a hormone condition that must be treated by a drug injection minutes after symptoms appear to avoid a coma			2
the pre-teen , from @entity17 , @entity18 was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and surgery to remove the mass disturbed her metabolism and left her body unable to regulate energy or appetite			1
back to school : @entity5 , 12 , smiles ahead of her first day of sixth grade on monday			1
it comes five months after she underwent gastric surgery to curb her weight gain following a rare brain tumor still smiling : when asked how her first day back to schoolwent , @entity5 gave a thumbs up and a thumbs down to show that it was fine , her @entity36 page explained - but she was still smiling @entity5 , previously a happy and healthy girl of normal weight , gained 151lbs in the space of two years thanks to hypothalamic obesity			1
she developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity - related problems			0
her parents @entity45 and @entity46 , learned that their insurance did not cover bariatric surgery , so they set up an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $ 86,000 to cover medical costs			1
@entity5 went under the knife on march 21			2
due to complications , what should have been a gastric bypass had to be changed to a gastric sleeve surgery at the last minute			2
the sleeve gastrecomy saw her stomach permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its original size			0
according to her doctors , without the surgery @entity5 would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise			2
if her condition was left untreated , @entity5 soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs			1
before surgery : she put on more than 150lbs following surgery for the brain tumor			1
her parents , @entity45 and @entity46 , turned to the internet when their insurance refused to cover the gastric surgery for @entity5 fighter : she is pictured ahead of the surgery in march			1
since getting the gastric sleeve , she has lost 50 lbs all smiles : @entity5 is pictured before she was diagnosed with the life - changing rare brain tumor but three months after the surgery , her mother revealed @entity5 ' type 2 diabetes was ' pretty much gone '			1
at 203lbs , @entity5 was also suffering form an enlarged liver , but now the large organ is substantially smaller and her blood chemicals are at normal level			2
on monday , when she returned to class , a school nurse stood by with a walkie - talkie and her emergency medicine in case her hormone condition sparked an ' adrenal crisis ' , @entity7 reported			1
the adrenal insufficiency is a side effect of the brain tumor and she also takes oral drugs to manage it			1
but when a crisis is on its way , she starts to get a headache , vomits and has low blood sugar			0
if symptoms were to show , she would need a dose of @entity106 within 30 minutes			0
if she does not get it , her organs will begin shutting down , her mother said			0
back in charge : @entity5 is now swimming and playing like she did before and her mother says she has more confidence			2
she is pictured right in a swimsuit - which had been one of the little girl 's aims @entity115 said her daughter 's return to school was both exciting and nerve - racking			0
' it 's ... a huge step in the right direction , but it 's just so hard to let go , ' her mother @entity45 told @entity7			0
' i 'm her security blanket			0
i 've always been with her so i 've learned her symptoms			0
' but shesaid that not only is @entity5 more physically capable , she is also returning to her happy , confident self			0
she recalled a recent conversation that ' melted my heart '			0
her daughter told her : ' you know what ? i used to see this fat little , chubby girl ( in the reflection )			0
i looked in the mirror and i saw somebody pretty			0
