for thousands of years , phallic objects have been used symbolically as a means to boost fertility and ward off evil spirits - but their use as sexual aids has a long history , too			1
a 28,000 - year - old phallus found in @entity9 recently , for example , is quoted as being the oldest known ' sex toy ' ever found			1
while phalluses made from stone , wood , leather and even camel dung have all be found during excavations , or referenced throughout historical text and images			1
to celebrate this expansive history of sexual experience , the @entity19 currently has a number of ceremonial sculptures shaped - among other sexual artefacts - as part of its @entity27 exhibition			1
a 7.8 - inch ( 20cm ) long , 1.1 - inch ( 3cm ) wide stone object ( pictured ) was found in the @entity29 near @entity30 in the @entity31			1
the prehistoric ‘ tool ’ is made from 14 fragments of siltstone and dates back 28,000 years			1
due to its size , experts believe it may be the earliest example of a sex aid ever found the term dildo was first coined in around 1400 ad and originated from the @entity41 for ‘ dilatare ’ , which means ‘ open wide ’ , and the @entity45 for delight , which translates as ‘ diletto			1
’ in the @entity49 , historical reports reference @entity50 and the @entity51 using unripe bananas , or camel dung coated in resin as sexual aids			1
but the aids were used much earlier , as far back as @entity57 , when phalluses were carved out of stone , leather or wood			1
some were even made from tar			2

however , they were said to be painful to use and their popularity waned			0
the first dildos did n’t arrive in the @entity134 until the 1500s			0
@entity136 , co-curator at the @entity19 said : ‘ @entity137 presents the study of sex in all its complexity and contradiction			1
‘ it brings together the diverse collections of data , art , testimony and objects of those who challenged preconceived ideas about sex and tells the human stories behind the charting of sexual experience			1
‘ highlighting the profound effect that gathering and analysing information can have in changing attitudes about the human condition , the exhibition reveals our understanding of sexual identity as an ever - evolving story			1
