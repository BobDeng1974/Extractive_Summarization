@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 is too modest to claim the club ’s recent revival is partly due to his own impressive personal comeback after he had been dropped earlier in the season by manager @entity6			1
nevertheless , the facts show that the resurgent @entity8 go into saturday 's potential top - four decider against @entity10 at @entity11 having been beaten only once in 19 domestic games — a @entity15 semi-final second leg against @entity16 — since @entity0 returned to the side on @entity18			1
prior to that , they had lost four out of seven in the @entity21 and had slipped to 10th place			1
@entity0 has been in impressive form for @entity1 during their resurgence in the @entity21 the @entity1 goalkeeper was dropped from the side earlier in the season after a number of mistakes the @entity30 first found out he had been axed the day before @entity1 faced @entity10 in the reverse fixture at @entity32 in december when @entity10 won 3 - 0			1
‘ the gaffer took me into his office to tell me i would n’t play against @entity10			2
it was disappointing and i could have let my head drop , but i decided to be positive to make sure my period on the sidelines was as short as possible , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i trained the next day to make sure i ’d be ready in a better way when the opportunity arose			2
’ his wish came true			0
when in - favour @entity41 injured his thigh four matches later at @entity44 , @entity0 came on , kept a clean sheet and has not looked back since			1
a 1 - 0 win at @entity47 on monday was his sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home — the first time that has happened since the days of @entity51			1
@entity0 makes a fine save from a @entity54 strike during the win against @entity47 on monday the @entity30 keeper kept his sixth consecutive @entity21 away clean sheet against the @entity58 victory against @entity10 would lift @entity1 into the top four and they would then be favourites to join @entity16 , @entity61 and @entity62 in next season ’s @entity63			1
the loss at @entity32 when @entity6 first introduced a three - man defence and played @entity67 up front now appears to be a watershed in the club ’s campaign			2
‘ i do n’t think it ’s anything to do with me personally , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ @entity72 changed the system [ to 3 - 4 - 3 ] and since then things have been very organised			2
we do n’t give many chances away and everybody is willing to work for each other			0
‘ it ’s all about working as a unit			0
we have dealt well with set - pieces and at the other end , scored goals			0
’ having been heavily criticised for key mistakes earlier in the season and dubbed ‘ @entity88 ’ by former @entity1 goalkeeper @entity86 for being indecisive with crosses , @entity0 is not taking recent good publicity for granted , even though he was @entity1 ’s man - of - the - match at @entity47 following crucial saves from @entity54 and @entity92			1
@entity0 , who was dropped earlier in the season , trains alonside @entity94 and @entity95 @entity1 have only lost once in 19 domestic matches since @entity0 returned to the side ‘ as a goalkeeper you ’re only remembered for your last game			1
i know i played half - decent against @entity47 but if things turn around against @entity10 on sunday , no one will mention that , ’ he said			0
‘ i know how it goes and how football is			0
you have to accept it , but that is also something positive because there ’s always something new around the corner			0
‘ the next game is always the biggest one			0
that ’s what we say			0
’ after last season ’s thrilling challenge for the league title , @entity6 reacted bravely when the first half to this campaign did not go according to plan			2
@entity1 impressed at @entity32 in december but fell to a 3 - 0 loss after a @entity125 masterclass @entity126 has emerged as a key figure in @entity1 's three - man defence in the past few months summer signings @entity130 , @entity95 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 were sidelined , while club captain @entity134 was allowed to negotiate a deal to join @entity136 this summer			1
instead , @entity67 was used as a centre - forward until @entity139 ’s recent return from injury as @entity6 returned to last season ’s quick - passing style			1
at the back , midfielder @entity126 was asked to be part of a back - three with @entity145 and the restored @entity131			0
as results improved , @entity95 and @entity132 were brought back in and the team remain unbeaten in the @entity21 in 2015 , having taken 33 points from a possible 39			1
@entity1 have narrowed the gap on @entity10 from 10 points to two			1
they are rediscovering the art of scoring goals while keeping it tight at the back			0
the @entity8 have n't tasted defeat in the @entity21 since the outing at @entity32 ‘ @entity47 was an example where we had to grind it out			1
it was 0 - 0 at half time and then we came out and put pressure on them high up the field			0
and we scored out of that [ through @entity164 ] , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ i think that ’s what we are about			0
the 3 - 0 defeat away to @entity10 was a while ago and there ’s no point in reflecting too much on what has been			0
professional footballers have to adapt to any system			2
it is more to do with the organisation and how everybody does their job rather than the system itself			2
‘ at the moment , the players are all working really hard			0
if the gaffer points something out , everybody is ready to listen and make sure it gets done			0
‘ there is no point looking over your shoulder [ at the past ] because what we are thinking about is preparing ourselves the best we can for the @entity10 game			0
