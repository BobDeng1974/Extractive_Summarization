@entity0 is the latest country to be the target for a futuristic building , designed to be the pinnacle in eco-construction			2
the multi-billion pound complex , called @entity7 , will be built in @entity8 and in addition to environmentally - friendly features such as solar panels , wind turbines and heating tubes , the property will house 1,000 apartments			1
there will also be three levels of offices and even a shopping centre with four levels of underground parking , valet services , babysitting and a 24 - hour pharmacy			1
called @entity7 , the project was designed by architect , @entity25 and will feature geothermal cooling , solar panels , heater tubes and wind turbines			1
the property will also house 1,000 apartments , offices and even a shopping centre , while the roof will transform into a community garden , swimming pools and a sports area the state - of - the - art project was designed by @entity37 architect , @entity25			1
built into the property , windcatchers , geothermal cooling , solar panels , solar heater tubes and wind turbines will generate electricity for the residents and manage the building 's temperature and energy waste levels			1
in @entity0 , windcatchers are known as @entity50 and function in three ways - directing airflow down using direct wind entry , directing airflow upwards using a wind - assisted temperature gradient , or directing airflow upwards using a solar - assisted temperature gradient			1
a series of nine so - called ' megatrees ' will be the nine windcatchers for @entity62 , and will improve cooling during warm seasons , and night cooling rates			1
in @entity65 , mr @entity25 plans to build air shafts into the cores to naturally cool each apartment			2
then , using ground loops , the geothermal heat pumps will move heat energy back and forth between the building and the earth to provide an efficient and environmentally - friendly way of heating and cooling apartments and commercial spaces			1
they will additionally provide hot water			0

passive geothermal cooling and heating system passive cooling is a technique that controls and movs heat around a building in order to improve indoor temperatures , without using a lot of energy			1
it works by either stopping heat entering the interior , known as heat gain prevention , or by removing heat from the building , or natural cooling			2

they will additionally provide hot water solar photovoltaic cells conventional solar cells use visible and infrared light to generate electricity , but photovoltaic cells use ultraviolet radiation			0
in the project , the solar roof will be covered by walkable solar creating shadows above the patios and the promenade			2
they will generate electricity for the building			0
the solar cells will be integrated in a double glass layer that will be easy to clean , too			0
solar water heating tubes solar water heating , or solar hot water systems , are designed to deliver hot water to all the bathrooms and kitchens of the building for most of the year , explained mr @entity25			1
glass - metal tubes collect heat from the sun , and heating the water will be managed using elliptical shapes covering the rooms in each core on the roof			2
the primary cause of heat build - up in cities is the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings , explained the architect			2
the @entity174 will feature green walls that reduce overall temperatures , and by covering the surface with plants , they will also be a way of recycling water			0
in the project , the nine megatrees will be covered by living walls ( pictured ) vertical axis wind turbines vertical - axis wind turbines are a type of turbine where the main rotor shaft is set vertically , and the main components are located at the base of the turbine			1
this allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground , making it easier to service and repair			0
these helical twisted wind turbines will be built along the inner street on the roof , to benefit from the winds , and generate electricity			1
@entity204 / living walls the primary cause of heat build - up in cities is the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings , explained the architect			2
the green walls will reduce overall temperatures of these building , and by covering the surface with plants , they will also be a way of recycling water			0
in the project , the nine megatrees will be covered by living walls			0
these walls will also be fitted along the inner street			0
smart home automation the technology will be built - in to the offices and apartments , meaning homeowners will be able to control the different zones , rooms and temperatures			2
multi-sensors will be used to detect the number of people in a room , motion , temperature , and light levels before adjusting to reach the perfect climate			0
this is expected to save wasted energy			0
in the project , the solar roof will be covered by walkable panels creating shadows above the patios and the promenade			2
they will generate electricity for the building			0
the roof of the building will be turned into a community garden , complete with orchards , infinity swimming pools and a sports area , and there will be multiple rooftop areas connected by foot bridges			1

mr @entity25 said work will start on the new building in march next year and it will be completed in 2019 ' it is time for @entity8 to witness the creation of an iconic sustainable building that would express the future of the city , ' said mr @entity25			1
' in the heart of this new @entity8 , the @entity7 is an innovative design idea for a green building , representing the combination of trees and building , and [ transforming ] the city into a vertical , green , dense and hyper - connected ecosystem			0
' the ambition of the @entity65 is to create a new prototype of inhabited ecosytem that will create 50 per cent energy savings			0
the building is also designed to decrease its carbon footprint , and to recycle a part of its own waste , for example			0
mr @entity25 said : ‘ the main objective behind this urban proposal is to raise awareness of green sustainable architecture to fight against global warming			0
‘ the project shows a high ambition in green energy and technology			0
the objective is to create a sustainable landmark in @entity8 by transforming this efficient building mass , multiplying the perspective views towards the streets , into a huge urban oasis			0
