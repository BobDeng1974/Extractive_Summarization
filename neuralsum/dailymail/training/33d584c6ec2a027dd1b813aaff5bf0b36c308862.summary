by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:37 est , 18 march 2012 sunday trading laws are to be relaxed this summer in a move that could pave the way for longer weekend opening hours all year round			1
@entity5 confirmed yesterday that he is to push through emergency legislation lifting the six - hour limit on opening hours for larger stores over eight weekends in july , august and september			1
the move , which brought protests from @entity12 , church leaders and trades unions , is designed to coincide with @entity16 ’s hosting of the @entity17 and @entity18			0
cashing in : shops will be open around the clock for eight weeks beginning on july 22 the chancellor , who will set out details in the budget on wednesday , said it would be an opportunity to try to stimulate the economy			1
‘ we have got the whole world coming to @entity16 and the rest of the country for the @entity17 , ’ he told @entity28 ’s @entity27			0
‘ it would be a great shame , particularly when some of the big @entity17 events are on a sunday , if the country had a “ closed for business ” sign on it			0
’ but mr @entity5 faced a backlash over the speed of the move – which will mean emergency laws being rushed through @entity43 in the next ten days			1
critics also predicted the government would move to a permanent shift in opening hours , undermining family life for those working in retailing			1
the chancellor fuelled that suspicion yesterday when he said he was proposing ‘ at the moment ’ only a temporary change during the @entity18			1
under starters orders : the @entity54 will take place between 27 july and 12 august @entity56 , director - general of the @entity57 , told @entity60 ’s @entity59 programme : ‘ i think there is a big difference between a temporary measure to try and lock in some of the spending of the thousands and thousands of international visitors who will come to @entity67 during the @entity17 on a sunday and a permanent change			1
‘ if it is a permanent change we would need to consult a lot of people , the shops themselves and the workers in those shops , but a temporary change just for the @entity17 – every little helps			0
’ @entity12 accused the government of a ‘ disgraceful ’ failure to consult on the move			0
shadow chancellor @entity81 said : ‘ today , on @entity82 , there are mums at home with their kids because sunday trading laws mean they can have the morning off			1
’ @entity90 , general secretary of shopworkers ’ union @entity88 , said : ‘ our members are vehemently opposed to any further deregulation of sunday trading hours and the government ’s own consultation on this just last year showed that there is no widespread support from either retailers or the general public for change			2
‘ any change would fly totally in the face of the government ’s commitment to be family - friendly			2
to suggest that the legislation , which allows shops to open for 150 hours a week , means @entity67 is “ closed for business ” is ridiculous			1
’ announcement : the chancellor will set out his sunday trading plans in the budget this wednesday mr @entity90 said he suspected the @entity17 was being used as a ‘ prelude to permanent change ’			2
he said culture secretary @entity116 , who has responsibility for the @entity17 , had agreed to an urgent meeting on the issue tomorrow			0
under the @entity123 , large shops over 280 square metres in @entity121 and @entity122 are restricted to six hours ’ continuous trading between 10am and 6pm on sundays and can not open at all on @entity125			2
some major retailers have been lobbying in @entity127 for at least five years for the restrictions to be torn up			0
the stores argue that 7,500 jobs would be created , generating extra money for the economy and the government through tax			1
@entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and the diy chains have thrown their weight behind the campaign in the past			0
but any change will alarm the owners of small stores , which can open all day on sunday and benefit from the restriction on their large rivals			2
@entity148 mp @entity147 , who tried to change sunday trading law via a private member ’s bill , said he was ‘ absolutely delighted ’ that the plan was now being taken up by the chancellor			2
it would ‘ send out a very powerful message that @entity67 is open for business ’			0
the mp for @entity157 , who used to work in retailing , said about 1,700 extra part - time jobs could be created as a result at the giant new shopping centre near the olympic park alone			0
but a @entity164 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity164 would strongly oppose any further attempts to erode the special nature of sunday , which legislation still reflects			0

@entity5 confirmed he is to push through emergency legislation lifting the six - hour limit
opening hours of larger stores are to be changed over eight weekends in july , august and september
the chancellor said it would be a chance to try to stimulate the economy
