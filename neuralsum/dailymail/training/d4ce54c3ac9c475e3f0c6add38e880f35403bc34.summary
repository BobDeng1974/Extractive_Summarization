a hero soldier who won the @entity2 in the @entity3 contemplated desertion after becoming sick of the hell and horror of the @entity7 , a recently discovered letter reveals			2
lance corporal @entity8 wrote a dispirited letter home to his brother and sister months after displaying incredible bravery that won him the highest military decoration for valour			1
the 31 - year - old snuck off with another soldier to spy on a @entity18 position ahead of an enemy counter-attack			2
lance corporal @entity8 , who was awarded the @entity2 for his valour in @entity3 , considered deserting the army after witnessing his comrades being ' blown to bits ' despite his colleague being shot and killed , @entity24 @entity8 carried on by himself and shot three snipers on the way			1
he spent an hour observing the enemy preparations and returned to provide vital information that gave the @entity30 the upper hand			1
but within months the inspiration that won him the @entity2 had disappeared after witnessing dozens of comrades ‘ blown to pieces ’ by shelling			1
the letter penned by corporal @entity8 in 1918 describes the heavy losses his battalion suffered			1
he was among just 35 out of 950 who survived the horror the shattered soldier told his siblings they had no idea of the terrible things the men endured in the trenches			2
near to breaking point , he went on to write how he considered walking off towards the @entity18 lines to be taken prisoner just so the war would be over for him			2
the remarkably frank letter has surfaced nearly 100 years later after it was put up for sale at auction			2
lance corporal @entity8 , of the @entity54 , penned the five page letter home in 1918 following a battle that decimated his 950 strong battalion to just 35 men			1
the @entity60 which fought in @entity3 he said : ‘ you people at home do n’t realise the terrible things we have to go through			2
what , with liquid fire , boiling oil , gas , rifle and machine guns and shells bursting around us and blowing poor men to pieces			1
‘ i have just come out of action , after some very hard fighting			2
there was only 35 left out of 950 men			2
so i have been lucky to pull through			0
‘ it was terrible fighting			0
it ’s as hard a fighting as i have seen			0
i am fighting for your safety and them children at home			0
corporal @entity8 writes to his family back home about wanting to ' forget the troubles ' of the war ‘ i am not the same as some men out here who are fighting for their wives and family			1
‘ can you tell me , why , i should be so loyal when i have no friends ? ‘ it ’s just as easy for me to walk to the @entity18 lines and be taken prisoner and then , i should be sure of being out of the terrible ordeal of this warfare			0
’ lance corporal @entity8 wrote about his hatred of the enemy , who he described as swine			1
he said : ‘ the @entity106 are making their final blow to smash the @entity108 from the @entity109			0
‘ but they will never manage it , if they could n’t do it in 1914 when we only had a handfull ( sic ) of men , i am dam ( sic ) sure they ca n’t do it now			0
i ’ll stake my life that this war is over within 6 months			1
‘ two more pushes and then the @entity106 are beat			0
we simply cut them up in thousands although we have to loose men to do it , but he looses a dam ( sic ) sight more than we do			0
‘ so dear brother and sister ... think of a lonely soldier out here fighting for civilisation and humanity , we have enough to do to fight the dirty hun , the lowest of the low			0
they are worse than swine			0
’ the letter was acquired direct from the @entity8 family by a well - known autograph hunter called @entity137			1
after he died his collection went to the unnamed man who is now selling it			0
soldiers occupying a @entity18 trench on the first day of the @entity143 during which corporal @entity8 fought and was awarded the @entity2 for his bravery @entity145 , of @entity146 , said : ‘ most letters i have read from soldiers fighting on the @entity7 convey a stiff - upper lip attitude			1
‘ but this letter is completely different in its tone			0
you sense that the author is near to the end of their tether having witnessed and endured such awful tragedies of war			0
‘ i guess that after three years of hard fighting he was entitled to feel that way			0
‘ yet it was only a few months before that he showed such gallantry to risk his own life in order to give his side the upper hand in a battle			1
‘ it ’s hard to believe that it is the same man in the letter			0
’ lance corporal @entity8 survived the war and died in @entity174 , @entity175 , in 1954 aged 67			1
the letter is being sold this saturday at the @entity177 at @entity178 , @entity179 , with a pre-sale estimate of £ 600 .			1
