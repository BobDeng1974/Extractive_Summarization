the 22 - year - old , who helped organise two official parties for @entity5 , said his tickets were ‘ special ’ ones which permitted entry ‘ as a guest of mayor ’ @entity19			1

@entity7 was offering tickets to the fireworks for 15 times their face value ‘ the mayor of @entity2 had a few tickets that he gave to some embassies			1
as we work for the @entity12 consulate [ in @entity34 ] we made some arrangements and they gave us tickets			2
’ @entity38 fireworks display , which lights up the @entity39 , has become massively popular , attracting a crowd of half a million people last year			0
this year , it was made ticket - only because of concerns about public safety , but critics warned that touts would try to take advantage			0
to combat touting , mr @entity19 ordered that all tickets should have the name of the purchaser printed on them , which would be checked against the holder ’s @entity54 before they were allowed entry			1
mr @entity7 , who was offering the tickets on @entity59 , said that ‘ the best thing of my ticket is they do n’t have name as a guest of mayor [ sic ] ’ , adding : ‘ it is a special ticket i got for working at the @entity66			1
’ he met @entity5 in @entity34 in march 2012 when he was on the organising committee for a polo dinner held in aid of the @entity5 ’s @entity71 charity			2

around 100,000 people watched the fireworks on the banks of the @entity39 @entity2 welcomed 2015 with a spectacular firework show the mayor ’s office denied that special tickets had been given to @entity12 embassies , and the @entity99 said it was not aware of any			1
a spokesman for the mayor said : ‘ what he is suggesting is impossible as all the tickets were printed with the purchaser ’s name on them and posted to people			0
they also contain holographic stamps which can not be printed out			0
‘ touting is n’t illegal , but we ’ve gone to great lengths to prevent touting and second selling , and have been encouraging people not to buy tickets from unofficial sites			2
‘ this looks like a scam and it ’s simply wrong to suggest the mayor gave away a small number of tickets			0
he had no tickets to give away			0
‘ this man ’s claims are completely false and we do not believe he possesses genuine tickets to the event			0
’ official tickets for last night ’s fireworks sold out by december 16 , and were being unofficially re-sold for up to £ 247 on ticket websites			1
