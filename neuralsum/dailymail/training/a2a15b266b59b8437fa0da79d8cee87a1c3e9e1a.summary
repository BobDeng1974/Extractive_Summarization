seconds later the @entity65 accelerated towards the men alongside the @entity11 which ploughed into the group while most of the men were not looking			0
mr @entity62 told the jury : ' had it not been for the @entity64 and @entity65 the crowd would not have been in that part of the road , available for the @entity11 to hit			1
horrifying : jurors watched @entity82 footage of the fatal impact , which clearly shows @entity10 ( left ) , @entity8 ( centre ) and @entity9 ( right ) being flung into the air after they were hit by the car on @entity87 ' they would have been either on the pavement or closer to the pavement and the safety of the pavement and forecourt provided			1
' had they not done what they did , those in the crowd , particularly those in the road , would have been more aware of the oncoming third car , the @entity11 , more aware of the danger it presented and better able to try and get out of the way			2
' that is why we say these three cars were driving together in a concerted plan			0

' you see all the three key vehicles in this case just after impact and we say that picture paints the point probably better than i can - as to the co-ordinated nature of this driving			0
