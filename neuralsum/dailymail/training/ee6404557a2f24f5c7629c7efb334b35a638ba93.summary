justice : @entity1 says he is considering suing the police after being given a life sentence in january 1997 for an attempted rape he did not commit a postman who spent 17 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of attempted rape says he is a ' greater person ' for his miscarriage of justice			1
@entity1 , 53 , says he ' wants justice ' and is considering suing the police after being given a life sentence in january 1997 for the attempted rape of a 22 - year - old woman			1
but despite spending almost a third of his life behind bars for a crime he did n’t commit , mr @entity1 says he has no bitterness towards the prison system , and insists the experience was a positive one			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity23 in @entity24 , was finally freed from @entity25 on december 13 after dna evidence from the woman 's blouse was examined , which revealed another unknown man was the perpetrator			2
he maintained his innocence throughout his spell in prison , even though it meant serving the full life sentence instead of pleading guilty and being released after serving half			1
mr @entity1 believes his original defence team were ' incompetent ' and says that while on trial he came close to confessing as it appeared the only way to get a lighter sentence			1
he said : ' the police never had any evidence against me but my legal team in the trial were incompetent but i was n't to know that at the time			1
i had never been at a trial before			0
' mr @entity1 added : ' the evidence has always been freely visible			2
i have had 17 years of this so now it is time for justice … i want my life back			0
' on how he found prison to be a positive experience , mr @entity1 said : ' really i am a greater person for this experience , all experiences are valuable			1
like @entity56 said ' there is no easy walk to freedom ''			0
he added : ' now i have to be rational , the system is as it is and i have to be patient			0
i have missed out on a lot			0
i still think i am in my 30s because prison has its own time			0
' speaking of potentially suing over his wrongful imprisonment , mr @entity1 said : ' i would like to think there is potential for civil action but i do n't want to pre-empt what the outcome might be			1
' wrong man : @entity1 spent 17 years at @entity25 , but says he found the experience positive changes : @entity1 was 36 - years - old ( left ) when he was wrongly imprisoned for attempted rape			1
he was finally released 17 years later , aged 53 ( right ) back home : @entity1 says he came close to confessing to the crime , despite not committing it , as it appeared the only way to get a lighter sentence he added : ' i have called for the police to re-open the investigation and i think the victim should as well … surely the bigger interest is justice for the victim - she has never received any apology			1
' although he believes @entity25 ' did all they could under the circumstances ' , mr @entity1 says the only way he survived 17 years in prison was by studying the details of his case ' like an academic '			1
describing his case as an ' escape from prison life ' , mr @entity1 says he had to remove himself from the facts and comb through the details as if they had happened to somebody else			1
but as appeal after appeal failed , mr @entity1 says he became increasingly cynical about his prospects of release ' as a self defence mechanism '			2
@entity104 : the former postman says he only survived his time at @entity25 by studying the details of his case mr @entity1 's hard work eventually paid off when he was given seven days ' notice of an appeal hearing			2
freedom : mr @entity1 says 17 years in prison made him a ' greater person ' although he did n’t have long to prepare , 17 years of research ensured mr @entity1 was able to present a strong case			2

' mr @entity1 was taken to @entity137 train station by the prison 's deputy governor , where he says the reality of his time away from the outside world really hit him			2
he says he was shocked by how many people were crowded into the train station and could n’t believe the price of a payphone call had risen from 10p to 60p			0
despite claiming to find anonymity among the crowds ' calming ' , mr @entity1 says he chose to celebrate @entity150 alone as having his freedom was enough			0
he says his biggest regret is not having children , but has big plans for 2014 – including finding a place of his own and possibly even travelling the world			0
mr @entity1 says : ' one place i want to go is @entity159 but it will be a long time until then '			0
