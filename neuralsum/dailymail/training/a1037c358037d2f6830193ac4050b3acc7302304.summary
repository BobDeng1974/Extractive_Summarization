she is one of the few women to survive @entity2 , endured a brutal forced march and ended @entity4 in the hellish place that was @entity6			1
but , as the world marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of @entity2 , @entity10 says she has forgiven the people who almost killed her - and holds no grudges against the @entity13			1
@entity10 , now 88 , says today 's @entity14 should n't be held responsible for their forefather 's crimes but worries that a repeat of the @entity19 genocide could be repeated elsewhere			1
' it ’s a different generation , ' said @entity10 , speaking ahead of today 's @entity26 , which will be screened on @entity27 this evening			1
' @entity14 have got a guilt complex because they say , well they are , they are the children of the killers			2
' but we always say , " look it does n't matter if you ’re the child of a killer , you are not responsible - you were not the killer			2
' you have no guilt and you should n't be feel guilty because you did n't do anything			0
it was a personal choice and you can not be responsible for what your parents did or your grandparents			0
' @entity10 , who now lives in @entity42 in @entity43 , was born in the @entity45 city of @entity46 and was just 13 when war broke out			1
after enduring unimaginable privations in @entity50 , the family attempted to escape to @entity51 in early 1941 but with the border closed , they were forced to travel back into @entity45			0
survivor : @entity10 , pictured with her mother @entity54 , was sent to @entity2 aged 16 concern : @entity10 - @entity56 says there is no guarantee that the @entity59 will not be repeated in future while being sheltered by a priest named @entity63 , the family were able to obtain false permits and @entity10 and her mother joined a transport of @entity45 being taken into @entity13 to work for the @entity68 factory in @entity69			1
but a year after arriving , @entity10 - @entity56 , her mother and 12 other @entity71 working at the factory were betrayed to the @entity73 and on the 2nd april 1943 , she arrived at @entity2			1
unusually , both @entity10 and her mother were selected to work , with both given jobs stripping the dead and sorting their possessions at @entity77 - the death camp part of the @entity2 complex			1
' i just remember never ending columns of people going in [ to the crematoria ] and never coming out , ' remembers @entity10			1
' we had no contact with people that were going to gas chamber			2
they were behind electric fencing and although they were not far away , they were too far too to recognise so you could n't communicate with anyone that was passing by			0
' @entity10 - @entity10 says even if they had been able to warn the columns of men , women and children of the fate in store for them , it would n't have made a huge amount of difference			1
as a child : mrs @entity10 ( far right ) is pictured with her family including brother @entity109 ( second left ) @entity110 : as well as dealing with the dead , @entity10 - @entity56 worked in the women ’s infirmary liberation : @entity2 was liberated by the advancing @entity115 , 70 years ago today ' what were you going to tell them ? were you going to tell them they were now going to die ? you would n’t have done them a favour telling them that would you ? ' it was much better people did n't know then if they did know they were going to die			1
so no. it was never , never even in my thought to have warned people of what was going to happen			2
' we could n’t go and tell these people , " now you are going to die " - that would have been a really cruel thing to have done and anyway , it was it was totally forbidden			0
' despite the hardships and the constant threat of death , @entity10 - @entity56 , who at one point succumbed to typhus , survived - as did her mother			1
but as the @entity115 of @entity51 approached , the pair were ' evacuated ' along with a group of 100 women and taken to a sub-camp of @entity146 in the town of @entity148 , now @entity149 in southern @entity45 , where they were put to work in the local @entity152 factory			2
not long after , with the @entity115 still advancing , @entity10 and her mother were marched out of the camp along with 10,000 others			2
they were destined for a factory in @entity158 in north - western @entity13 but the conditions on the march were so harsh , just 200 arrived			0
haunting : the camp , including @entity77 , has been preserved and is now a museum @entity163 : @entity10 had her tattoo removed after moving to @entity165 but kept it ( pictured ) along with her mother 's but with the @entity169 approaching from the west , @entity10 - @entity56 's stint at the camp proved to be short - lived and once again , she and the other women were evacuated			2
crammed into cattle cars , they eventually pulled up outside the notorious @entity6			2
but rather than being taken inside , the women were left to starve			0
' we were led to the big siding outside @entity6 and then at that rail junction stood dozens of trains , all full of people inside			1
' sealed - in cattle trucks - sealed in			0
you could hear some people crying and some you could n’t hear anything at all			0
' the train just stood at the siding and people were just left to die outside @entity6			1
' just as it seemed her luck might finally have run out , a group of @entity13 soldiers took pity on the suffocating @entity71 and agreed to take them to a camp at @entity192 , a subsidiary of the @entity194 concentration camp			0
it was to prove the last stop before liberation for @entity10 , who was freed along with 1,000 other women when the @entity199 arrived on the 29th april 1945			2
@entity10 and her mother had survived but only just			0
her father , as she later discovered , had been murdered by the @entity73 , while her brother @entity109 had been killed in the fighting			0
final destination : for most of the people who arrived , @entity2 was their final destination selection : @entity10 - @entity56 initially worked sorting the belongings of the people murdered in the gas chambers her grandmother , like 95,000 other @entity71 , had been murdered in the gas chambers of @entity213			1
despite the horror of her experiences , @entity10 - @entity56 , who recently revisited @entity2 with a pair of teenage girls , says she will continue to speak out about what happened			1
' [ after the war ] , i vowed no matter what i was going to do in my life , i ’ve got to make quite sure that people know what happened , ' she says			0
' it is a warning			0
we try and do this to protect future generations because we have no guarantee about what ’s going to happen			0
' have we a guarantee that this can not happen again ? who can give you this guarantee today ? if you see what ’s going on around the world , can you say , " oh no it can never happen ? " ' that is why i think it ’s important for people to know what ’s in store - to protect future generations at least			2
' i believe it ’s my duty to to say what i have witnessed			0
' among the six @entity249 ( extermination camps ) , @entity2 holds a unique place thanks to its dual role as a concentration and work camp , and because of the especially large number of people murdered there			1
although the majority of @entity71 from @entity10 's native @entity46 died at the @entity213 death camp , among them her grandmother , @entity2 was the final destination for one in six of @entity261 's @entity71 as well as prisoners of war , gypsies and other groups deemed undesirable by the @entity265			1
the original camp , @entity2 , was built in 1940 to house @entity45 and @entity268 prisoners , and continued to do so throughout the @entity19 period , although @entity71 were also held in the camp from the start			1
@entity272 was built in 1941 and was designated a vernichtungslager by @entity274 , @entity275 , the same year			0
one of the first death camps , gas chambers were pioneered at @entity2 and replaced the unreliable gas van method , which saw small groups murdered using the carbon monoxide produced by the exhaust			1
the technology paved the way for a further five large camps : @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity213 , @entity287 and @entity288 , as well as two smaller camps , @entity290 in what is now @entity292 and @entity293 in @entity294			0
but of all the camps , none murdered as many as @entity2 which , after mass transports of prisoners began in 1942 , was able to ‘ process ’ 9,000 @entity71 a day at the peak of its operations			0
among those who died at @entity304 were 400,000 @entity305 , 300,000 @entity45 , 69,000 @entity306 , 25,000 @entity307 , 7,500 @entity308 and six @entity165 jews from the @entity310			0
of the 1.3 million murdered at @entity77 , 200,000 were children .			0

@entity10 , now 88 , was 16 when she was sent to @entity2
was put to work sorting the possessions of people killed in gas chambers
endured a death march and was left to suffocate outside @entity6
mrs @entity10 , who lives in @entity42 , says she holds no grudges
says it is *unfair* to hold *modern* @entity14 responsible for @entity19 crimes
says there is no guarantee the @entity59 could n't happen again
@entity330 service , *tonight* at *7pm* on @entity27 . @entity10 appears in @entity59 : a story of @entity332 , @entity333 , *tomorrow* at *10.45pm*
