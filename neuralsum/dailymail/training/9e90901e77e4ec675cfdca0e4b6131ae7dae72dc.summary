by @entity0 @entity2 's birthplace is set to become an integration centre for immigrants while the @entity6 bunker where he died has already become a booze shop the birthplace of @entity9 dictator @entity2 is to be turned into an integration centre for immigrants as it was revealed the bunker where he met his end has become a booze shop			1
@entity18 officials keen to end a growing row over the future of the house where the infamous chancellor was born in the town of @entity16 and are close to a deal with the owner to convert it for its proposed new use			2
the move comes after it emerged that the air raid bunker where he ended his life and where the @entity9 came to an end has been turned into a beer emporium			1
the @entity36 booze store is just yards from the bunker where on april 30 , 1945 , @entity2 and his new bride @entity38 ended their lives with gunshots and cyanide thirty feet underground			1
@entity2 spent the first three years of his life in what was then a local pub in @entity16 during the 1890s			1
his parents rented rooms so that his father could carry out his job as a customs official at the nearby @entity18 @entity53 border			0
the @entity54 left three years after @entity2 's birth and in 1938 it was bought by the @entity58 's private secretary @entity57			1
after @entity60 , the building was rented by the @entity18 in 1952 and until 1965 it was the home of the public library and later a bank			2
the current row over the house started when the mayor of @entity66 from the conservative @entity67 ( @entity67 ) said publicly that they did n't need another monument to the evils of war			0
he had added that the @entity58 had ' only lived there for three years anyway '			2
the mayor added that there was already a memorial stone outside the building and said he felt that the local community had already done enough to remember the past , and there was therefore no need to feel pressurised to turn the property into something similar			0
@entity2 's birth place in the northern @entity18 city of @entity16 could be turned into an integration centre for immigrants in @entity6 , a beer emporium has opened up close to the spot where @entity2 died in a bunker in 1945			1
a plaque has been installed nearby informing passersby about the area 's history but after the international headlines that it generated the council partially backed down and said it had backed the idea of turning the house into a place where minorities would be helped to integrate which included language courses for children who were not native @entity53 speakers , and other community integration projects			1
the council confirmed that the humanitarian aid organisation @entity109 had been asked to take over managing the integration and language courses that will be offered to immigrants			1
after that a @entity114 mp said he was planning to put in a bid to buy the house so that ' every trace of fascism is wiped off the planet '			0
mp @entity120 from the ruling @entity122 party said he had even started collecting the Â£ 1.7 million that he estimates he needs and is being supported in the project by the @entity114 @entity125			0
but the house is not for sale , and the current owner who gets a monthly rental from the @entity130 had reportedly been difficult over exactly what use the property could be put to			0
but there is now optimism that the latest proposals will be accepted ahead of a deadline on friday			0
meanwhile , a beer emporium owner in @entity6 says he intends to put up an informative plaque outside his store - next to the bunker site where @entity2 and @entity38 ended their lives			1
@entity143 , manager of the beer emporium , intends to put up his own to inform customers that they are buying a slice of history along with their beer the @entity36 booze store , run by @entity143 , is just yards from the bunker where on april 30 , 1945 , @entity2 and his new bride @entity38 ended their lives with gunshots and cyanide thirty feet underground @entity2 's bunker was reduced to rubble in 1945			1
in the years that followed it fell under the death strip of the @entity161 during the years of the @entity162 and later a car park was built over it having been filled with concrete by the @entity165 @entity143 said : ' although tourists find their way here , not everyone in the city knows that the bunker was here			2
' i was born after @entity60 but i have heard the stories from my parents and grandparents			0
' i imagine what happened 70 years ago , and there is much blame , but i can not be responsible for those events			0
' i 'm a man of another generation , i see no problem to talk about the history , and can not see why other @entity53 have			0
' the bunker was the air raid shelter for @entity2 's chancellery which he had to retreat to in early 1945 as the @entity186 @entity185 advanced on land towards the capital and the bombers of @entity190 and @entity191 pounded it into brickdust from the skies			1
