need some help and inspiration deciding who to back at @entity3 ? @entity5 's @entity4 and @entity6 reveal their favourites while @entity9 presenter @entity8 and other celebrities have also shared their tips for the @entity12			1
@entity4 eight - time champion jockey and rider of 13 @entity12 winners @entity16 ( @entity17 ’ @entity18 , 1.30 ) rated one of the best horses @entity21 trainer @entity20 has brought to the meeting , which is saying something			1
having beaten some very decent opposition without coming off the bridle , it is impossible to truly measure his merit but the vibes are strong and he should be able to successfully start what could be an amazing afternoon for @entity20 and his stable jockey @entity32			1
@entity33 looks best of the @entity34 but that might not be good enough			1
best odds : 13 - 8 @entity37 , pictured at the gallops , is rated one of the best horses @entity20 has brought to the meeting @entity41 @entity40 ( @entity42 , 2.05 ) another @entity20 - trained hot - pot. @entity43 when clear on his steeplechasing debut but has since pulverised some good performers including tuesday ’s rival @entity47 by 15 lengths in january			1
some fear his temperament might get the better of him given the atmosphere but he was far more tractable for @entity32 on that last run			1
best odds : 8 - 13 the new one ( @entity54 , 3.20 ) my pick to derail the @entity20 bandwagon by beating hot favourite @entity58 and his two - time champion stablemate @entity60			2
some say the gelding trained by @entity64 and ridden by his son @entity65 was n’t as unlucky as he looked last year when almost brought down at the third hurdle and his failure to keep up on the run to the home turn was crucial			2
but that ignores how significant a loss of momentum and rhythm can be in a top - quality race			2
best odds : 7 - 2 @entity76 ( @entity79 mares ’ hurdle , 4.00 ) @entity20 has won this race with @entity81 for the last six years and this mare , whose only career defeat came in last year ’s @entity84 , could be even better			2
kept off the track all season by injury but only needs to be near her best to beat a field of inferior rivals			2
best odds : 8 - 13 @entity92 is @entity4 's tip to beat favourite @entity58 and @entity60 @entity94 @entity95 ( @entity17 ’ @entity18 , 1.30 ) fair form last season but really flourished this term winning all three races			1
that includes giving weight and a length - and - a - half beating to tuesday ’s rival @entity102 at @entity3 in december			2
the run looks even better when you factor in his bad jumping error at the fourth flight			0
trainer @entity108 has his string back in good form after quiet spell			0
best odds : 20 - 1 @entity114 ( @entity42 , 2.05 ) lacks experience , racing over fences only once when winning at @entity117 in october having been kept away from the worst of the winter ground			0
winning a flat race on the all - weather is unconventional preparation but @entity123 ’s gelding was a fast finishing fourth in last year ’s @entity17 ’ @entity18 and has frame claims if he can pounce off a strong pace set by favourite @entity126			0
best odds : 16 - 1 @entity127 ( @entity128 ’ @entity18 , 4.00 ) @entity76 is the red - hot favourite for the race but @entity132 ’s @entity131 looks a great each - way option			0
she is a @entity134 winner who peaks in the spring and was third in this race last year			0
she also has a decent weight pull for her course defeat by @entity138			0
best odds : 16 - 1 @entity114 was a fast finishing fourth in last year 's @entity139 @entity9 ' @entity8 is backing @entity92 and the celebs ... here 's who the celebs are backing in the @entity54			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity143 racing commentator @entity145 @entity58 might be anything but at the prices , last year ’s winner looks the each - way bet			0

@entity151 rugby union star turned bookmaker @entity153 i have been a fan all season and those who say he has beaten nothing are wrong			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... @entity160 - professional jockey @entity153 @entity20 ’ star gelding is one of my strongest fancies for the whole of the @entity12 week			1
@entity8 - @entity9 presenter the new one unlucky in this race last year and i prefer to back a proven hurdler rather than one with potential			1
he should have a better race this time round			0
@entity172 400m athlete and tv presenter @entity153 the popular choice but i hope he can live up to the nickname ‘ @entity178 ’ .			1
