@entity1 's only surviving mobile cinema has gone on sale for £ 120,000 as the owners who spent years of their life restoring it and touring the country now want to enjoy parenthood			1
@entity8 , 36 , and @entity9 , 37 , from @entity10 , bought the cinema for just £ 1,200 in 2005 and spent £ 35,000 on restoring the vintage classic with friends in @entity14 over five years			1
they toured the country with the classic bus which became a celebrity , starring alongside @entity19 in a 20 - part @entity20 ' the @entity21 and in ' @entity23 's @entity22 '			2
restored : @entity1 's last - ever mobile cinema has been brought back to its former glory after film buffs found it rotting in a field in 2005 but now the pair have decided the time has come to sell the bus , which has taken over their lives for more than a decade			1
' we 've got two children under three , ' @entity8 said			0
' sometimes my mother - in - law comes along and looks after the kids on whatever event site we 're on but it 's getting to be too hard with the two of them getting bigger			0
' after years on the road , the couple had their first baby @entity45 in 2012 and five months ago , they 're second arrived , @entity48			0
since then , @entity9 has had to spend five months a year on tour while @entity8 stays at home with the children and he 's now looking forward to having more time with @entity53 and @entity48			1
love affair : @entity8 and @entity9 outside the @entity56 cinema which has taken over their lives since they restored it ten years ago @entity53 may @entity59 , two and a half years old , sits outside the mobile cinema			1
her parents are looking to offload the classic so they can concentrate on being parents to her and sister @entity48 , five months old			0
@entity9 does n't want to be on tour as they grow up happy families : @entity8 with @entity53 may , left , and @entity48 , right			2
the family have just bough they 're first home in @entity10 ' i 'll miss being on the road and that diversity but if i did n't give it up , i 'd miss my children growing up and spending social time with them which is more important than the bus			2
' it 's now listed on @entity80 for £ 120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for , but it 's not just a bus , it 's a piece of @entity1 history , listed as ' the soul survivor ' of the original fleet			1
it 's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the @entity92 in 1967 , to promote @entity1 industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation			1
with a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a @entity102 - like interior with a 26 - seater cinema inside , the @entity98 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the ' white heat of technology '			1
the vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the @entity92 in 1967 a piece of history : this was how the buses were advertised when they toured factories to promote @entity1 industry in the 1960s @entity118 seven : the vintage is the soul survivor of a fleet of seven and was rescued from a field in @entity122 where it sat for 14 years promoting industry : bosses and workers at factories would enter the visiting bus to learn about the ' white heat of technology ' but like all modern creations , soon enough they grew old and it was n't long before this particular cinema was on the road to being forgotten			1
it was owned by the @entity136 between 1975 and 1990 but after that it sat in a field in @entity122 for 14 years until it was rescued by a previous owner based in @entity10			1
in 2005 , @entity9 and @entity8 of the @entity139 bought it for just £ 1,200 and brought it to @entity14 , where they carefully restored it with the help of friends			1
they spent £ 35,000 on the restoration which put the vintage cinema back on the road and touring a series of shows at @entity14 schools and villages and beyond			1
from there it went on to exhibit at film festivals , community , corporate and private events around the @entity1 and abroad , travelling as far as @entity159 and @entity160			0
listed : the rare @entity56 mobile cinema was fully restored between 2005 and 2010 and is now on offer on @entity80 for £ 120,000 @entity163 and @entity8 are hoping that someone else might take up the mantle and continue touring the bus but at this point the future of the cinema is uncertain			1
@entity9 said : ' it could go any which way - a collector in this country or abroad , someone wanting to run the business , or a group putting together a bid to bring it into a trust			1
' i really want it to continue to be out there for people to be able to carry on sharing the experience			0
' but we have to decide what route is going to best secure its future , because it 's completely unique and owning it means that we 're custodians of that little bit of history			0
government property : the fleet of @entity191 as they were when they toured the country promoting industry in the 1960s ' it was never meant to be a career - i just started doing it up as a hobby and it got out of control			2
' i was working full time and spending all my spare time and spare money on the bus , lying in the mud in a freezing cold shed wondering if i 'd gone mad			0
' but people just loved everything about it , which made all the blood , sweat and tears worthwhile			0
' they do n't make things like this anymore , and it speaks to people 's sense of nostalgia			0
' it was so popular that it absolutely and 100 per cent took over my life - and it 's been hard to give up to because so many people still want the bus			0
' there 's also a new edition which could be a different opportunity to a new owner			0
the vehicles originally towed huge exhibition trailers and remarkably the cinema has now been reunited with its trailer - after being separated for 23 years			1
re-united : the owners got a call ' @entity235 ' from someone who knew where the buses trailer was after they had been separated for 23 years			1
now the pair have come together again - but the trailer is a restoration project in itself for the new owner ' we got a phone call out the blue , ' said @entity9			1
' someone saw us on the news and realised that the trailer their friend had been using as a woodwork shop belonged with our cinema			2
' it 's taken a few years but we 've finally put them back together			0
' @entity9 had been promised the trailer from an owner sympathetic to their project around four years ago but when he finally got it , it 's actually what convinced the family to part with the bus			1
' it 's a huge restoration which i do n't think i want to do because i have a number of other projects that i 'm hoping to work on			0
' we 've just bought our first house in @entity10 which is a restoration project and i 've also got a 1940s caravan and another 1960s @entity56 truck to work on			2
' i 'm the kind of guy who likes a challenge but i feel like the bus is done now and i want to work on something new - i 've been doing it most of my adult life			0
' they drive beautifully together but the trailer is another restoration project - maybe this time for someone else			2
' mod cons : inside the cinema is far from vintage with a full @entity286 projector and @entity288 surround sound the vintage piece is advertised as the ' only surviving ' member of a fleet of seven and has 26 1930s - style seats - as well as a few modern tweaks			2
the projection kit is full hd , with a 7.1 @entity288 surround sound , complemented by sound proofing fitted to ' limit external disturbances '			0
there 's also climate control , delivering hot and cold air ' for the comfort of the audience ' @entity9 and @entity8 hope that the cinema will remain in use for the people of @entity1 to enjoy			2
and although the price - tag is high , potential buyers wo n't get another opportunity to buy this piece of @entity1 history			0
' it 's one of a kind , ' @entity8 said			0
' it 's a once in a lifetime opportunity for someone			0
