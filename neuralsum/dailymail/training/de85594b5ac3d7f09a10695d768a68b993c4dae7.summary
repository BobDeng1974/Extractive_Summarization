brokers complain that applications which typically took a month to process are now taking five to six weeks			0
some lenders introduced the stricter tests months before the new regime officially came into force			0
last night one leading expert said the same lenders asking ‘ frankly ridiculous questions ’ are routinely failing to ask how much savings an applicant has			2
this means those who have saved money to pay for extra expenses such as children ’s school fees are being rejected , as the lender assumes the fees will have to be deducted from their salary			0
