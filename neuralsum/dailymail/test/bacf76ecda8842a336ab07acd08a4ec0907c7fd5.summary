@entity0 will become the first @entity2 club to win promotion this season should they beat @entity5 on tuesday night			1
the @entity7 leaders managed to come away from second - placed @entity8 unscathed , drawing 1 - 1 thanks to @entity11 ’s equaliser after @entity12 had opened the scoring just before the hour			1
regardless , @entity15 ’s side had been destined not to seal promotion at @entity17 because results elsewhere did n’t go their way			1
@entity0 manager @entity15 was happy to avoid defeat against @entity8 on saturday three points at @entity5 on tuesday will do the trick			1
it would take something to go seriously awry for the @entity25 not to be returning to the second tier after a two - year absence , and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west			0
‘ that ’ll be good , ’ @entity15 said			2
‘ we ’ll digest that and try and prepare properly for the game			0
‘ it was important not to get beat here			0
if you look at it , if we had and then got nothing at @entity5 ( on tuesday ) then we ’re stuck on 88 points			2
@entity42 would ’ve gone to 83 points today and then have @entity44 at home			0
‘ you always look at the worst case scenario			1
’ @entity0 ’s elevation to the second tier appears a formality , and @entity8 remain in pole position to join them			2
nevertheless , manager @entity52 has warned his players not to get carried away			0
‘ we ’ve said to the players we can only influence our own games , but it ’s another point to our tally and another game chalked off , ’ he said			0
‘ but there will be no complacency from the team , we know we have to keep working			0
’ @entity15 , meanwhile , has always gunned for the @entity7 title rather than just promotion and this result preserved their eight - point lead over @entity8 , although they have played a game more			1
his squad are staying in a nearby hotel until the trip to @entity73 and will train at @entity74 in preparation .			2

@entity0 held second - place @entity8 to 1 - 1 draw at @entity17 on saturday
*robins* could be first @entity2 club to win promotion on tuesday
