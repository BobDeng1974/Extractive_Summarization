by @entity0 published : 03:15 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 03:48 est , 13 december 2012 protestors have taken to the streets of @entity3 after three judges cleared 13 people accused of kidnapping a woman and forcing her into prostitution amid claims of corruption			1
political leaders have called for the judges to be impeached following yesterday 's ruling in the case of missing @entity15 ' @entity14			1
the outcome is a setback for @entity3 's efforts to combat sex trafficking , which began largely as a result of @entity23 's one - woman , decade - long quest to find her missing daughter			1
@entity26 's search exposed an underworld of organized crime figures who operate brothels with protection from authorities across @entity3			1
' setback ' : @entity23 holds a picture of her missing daughter @entity34 at her home in @entity3 security minister @entity36 called the verdict ' a tremendous slap in the face for the prospect of justice '			1
' it 's not only a reversal for this particular case of the kidnapping and disappearance of @entity34 , that made society feel deeply the drama of this kind of 21st century slavery , covered up for decades by the customs of a network of machista culture , ' she said			1
it also ' renders invisible the suffering of the victims of human - trafficking networks and sexual exploitation , who gave such courageous testimony during the trial , and consecrates judicial impunity for these crimes ' , @entity36 said			2
other officials also rallied around @entity14 's mother , denouncing the verdicts and praising government efforts to save women from prostitution			1
' today , more than ever , we stand united with @entity23 and her family in their quest to find @entity14 and we honor the courageous work she has done to defend the victims and the survivors of human trafficking in @entity3 and all over the world , ' @entity72 @entity71 spokeswoman @entity70 said			1
president @entity81 personally called @entity26 to express her surprise and outrage			2
' i thought i would find her destroyed , but i found her more together than ever , more committed to keep fighting , ' @entity84 said			2
' i told her , " @entity23 you can always count on me , " and she told me " president , do n't worry , i 'm going to keep fighting "			0
' @entity84 also said that while she ca n't prove it , she 's sure that judicial corruption influenced the verdicts , showing the need to reform how judges are picked and allowed to remain in their jobs			0
political rivals have called this campaign an attack on judicial independence			0
justice : @entity34 's mother @entity23 is seen leading a march towards the courthouse in @entity104 on the first day of the trial of the alleged kidnappers back in february @entity26 's lawyers said the verdict shows that impunity still reigns , and they said they would pursue appeals			1
' the reality is that the police are not investigating @entity14 's disappearance			1
it 's @entity23 who is investigating and it 's been this way from the beginning , ' attorney @entity114 told @entity0			0
' the @entity14 case is emblematic			1
as a result , much was learned about trafficking networks , how they move ( people ) , how they operate , ' he said			2
when @entity14 disappeared a decade ago , sexual exploitation and human trafficking got much less attention around the world , let alone in northwestern @entity3 , where she was allegedly kept as a sex slave by an organized crime ring with close ties to authorities in the provinces of @entity104 and @entity133			1
fighting : ms @entity23 has vowed to keep fighting for justice for her daughter much of the case was built years later , as @entity26 's efforts produced witnesses who said they suffered alongside @entity14 in the brothels			1
one said she saw @entity14 being beaten ; another said she saw her being held captive to provide sex to @entity143 clients			1
@entity144 , one of these women , testified that she had seen @entity14 with her hair dyed blonde wearing blue - tinted contacts at a brothel in @entity133			1
she said she had been kidnapped at gunpoint and forced into prostitution by the same organized crime ring , and testified that some of the accused said @entity14 had been sold off to brothels in @entity156			1
defence lawyers dismissed the women 's testimony as the lies of unreliable witnesses , and the lack of any physical evidence linking the defendants to @entity14 proved decisive , the judges said in a brief explanation from the bench			2
a fuller written justification for their verdicts is expected to be made public in several weeks			0
' it 's obvious that this process made mistakes , ' @entity114 acknowledged			0
' above all , this ruling is a message that the trafficking business will continue as usual			0
' simultaneous demonstrations were held in @entity177 on wednesday night to protest the verdicts			0
one led by governing party politicians outside the main federal justice building was peaceful			0
another , involving hooded youths outside the @entity104 provincial government 's tourism promotion office , quickly got out of hand with protesters smashing windows , throwing rocks and setting fire to two garbage bins they tried to push inside the building			0
reinforcements arrived and riot police pushed back the protesters , regaining control of the situation			0
@entity23 called on her supporters to keep the peace , even as she expressed her anger at a news conference wednesday , accusing the judges of taking bribes			0
the lead trial judge , @entity203 , did n't respond to the bribery allegations , but he countered in a local radio interview that the evidence failed to resolve reasonable doubts or overcome the principle of being innocent until proven guilty			0
memories : @entity34 ( left ) poses with her daughter @entity210 ( centre ) and her mother @entity23 ( right ) in 2002 prostitution remains legal in @entity3 , but managing brothels and trafficking in people have been federal crimes since 2008 , under a law @entity218 passed after lobbying by @entity26			1
@entity36 credited her ministry 's enforcement of this law with saving 938 people last year from trafficking - 215 people from the sex trade and 723 from other workplace exploitation			2
she said more than 800 have been rescued so far this year			0
hundreds of women also have been saved by a foundation @entity26 created in her daughter 's name in 2008 with seed money from the @entity233 's ' women of @entity235 ' award			0
the foundation also provides legal help , but its lawyers have found that proving sex slavery is difficult without full support from the same police who often get paid to protect prostitution rings			2
to date , the foundation has helped 20 former sex - trafficking victims bring cases against their captors , but they have yet to win a single case			0
of these , 12 resulted in federal charges , but a handful were bounced back to even more uncertain justice in provincial courts around @entity3			2
' they do n't investigate			0
there 's a lack of commitment and capability , ' said @entity258 , one of the foundation 's lawyers , who called the tuesday night 's verdicts ' an act of cowardice '			0
@entity258 joined @entity26 's movement after his father , a juvenile court judge in @entity104 , was shot to death in his home in 2004 after investigating local police officers who were allegedly freeing juvenile delinquents so that they could peddle drugs on their ( the police 's ) behalf .			2
