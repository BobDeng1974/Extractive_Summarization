by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 9 april 2013 curiosity has solved the mystery of how @entity3 lost its atmosphere			1
@entity6 's $ 2.5 billion rover has found evidence that as much as 90 % of the original atmosphere there has dissipated into space over the planet 's lifetime			1
curiosity also revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds			1

the rover has revealed further details of its life on the surface - with evidence of dust storms and whirlwinds rover team members revealed the readings at the @entity29 2013 @entity30 , in @entity31			1
@entity13 ’s @entity32 at @entity3 ( @entity34 ) instrument analyzed an atmosphere sample last week using a process that concentrates selected gases			1
the results provided the most precise measurements ever made of isotopes of argon in the @entity3 atmosphere			1
isotopes are variants of the same element with different atomic weights			0
' we found arguably the clearest and most robust signature of atmospheric loss on @entity3 , ' said @entity50 , a @entity34 co-investigator at the @entity51 , @entity52			2
@entity34 found that the @entity3 atmosphere has about four times as much of a lighter stable isotope ( argon - 36 ) compared to a heavier one ( argon - 38 )			1
this removes previous uncertainty about the ratio in the @entity3 atmosphere from 1976 measurements from @entity6 ’s @entity60 project and from small volumes of argon extracted from @entity3 meteorites			1
the ratio is much lower than the solar system ’s original ratio , as estimated from argon - isotope measurements of the @entity68 and @entity69			0
this points to a process at @entity3 that favored preferential ' leaking ' of the lighter isotope over the heavier one			2
a @entity75 - like self portrait of @entity6 's curiosity rover was taken by its @entity78 cameras , located on the now - upright mast			2
the rover has now sent back the first detailed analysis of the @entity3 atmosphere the team also revealed the result of curiosity 's weather monitoring			1
curiosity measures several variables in today ’s @entity3 atmosphere with the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , provided by @entity90			1
while daily air temperature has climbed steadily since the measurements began eight months ago and is not strongly tied to the rover ’s location , humidity has differed significantly at different places along the rover ’s route			2
these are the first systematic measurements of humidity on @entity3 , @entity6 said			0
trails of dust devils have not been seen inside @entity103 , but @entity89 sensors detected many whirlwind patterns during the first hundred @entity3 days of the mission , though not as many as detected in the same length of time by earlier missions			1
' a whirlwind is a very quick event that happens in a few seconds and should be verified by a combination of pressure , temperature and wind oscillations and , in some cases , a decrease is ultraviolet radiation , ' said @entity89 principal investigator @entity119 of the @entity120 , @entity121			0
this illustration shows the instruments and subsystems of the @entity32 at @entity3 ( @entity34 ) suite on the @entity13 of @entity6 's @entity126 , which the rover used to analyse the @entity3 atmosphere dust distributed by the wind has been examined by @entity13 ’s laser - firing @entity131 ( @entity133 ) instrument			1
initial laser pulses on each target hit dust			0
the laser ’s energy removes the dust to expose underlying material , but those initial pulses also provide information about the dust			0
' we knew that @entity3 is red because of iron oxides in the dust , ” said @entity133 deputy principal investigator @entity143 of the @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity146			2
' @entity133 reveals a complex chemical composition of the dust that includes hydrogen , which could be in the form of hydroxyl groups or water molecules			0
' as the @entity32 at @entity3 ( @entity34 ) suite of instruments on @entity6 's @entity13 heats a sample , gases are released ( or " evolved " ) from the sample and can be identified using @entity34 's quadrupole mass spectrometer			2
here are its first readings			0
for the rest of april , @entity13 will carry out daily activities for which commands were sent in march , using @entity163 , @entity89 and the @entity164 ( @entity164 )			0
no new commands are being sent during a four - week period while @entity3 is passing nearly behind the @entity68 , from @entity167 ’s perspective			0
this geometry occurs about every 26 months and is called @entity3 solar conjunction .			0

90 % of the original atmosphere there has dissipated into space over the planet 's lifetime .
thin air on @entity3 still generates dust storms and ' whirlwinds ' the rover 's results show
