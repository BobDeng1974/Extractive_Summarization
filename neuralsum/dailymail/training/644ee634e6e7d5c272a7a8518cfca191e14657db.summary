by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 10:49 est , 6 june 2013 @entity1 ? new research suggests that our children 's names reflect our political leaning			2
@entity7 called his daughter @entity8 suggesting that he is more left wing than we might have thought the name you choose for your baby gives away your political affiliation , new research has revealed			1
conservatives tend to choose more masculine - sounding names for their children with lots of @entity18 ’s and @entity19			1
they are also fond of choosing names with lots of @entity23 ’s and @entity24 ’s because they sound tough			0
the study showed that people with more left wing views do the opposite and tend to include a lot of feminine words			1
these include l sounds and soft - a endings such as @entity34			0
the findings may give a clue into how the likes of @entity7 really think - he chose @entity39 , @entity8 , @entity40 and @entity41 for his kids suggesting that he is really more liberal than conservative			1
labour leader @entity44 has two sons , called @entity0 and @entity46 , who seem more in keeping with his left - of - centre political beliefs			0
the @entity49 researchers looked at birth records from 545,018 babies born in @entity52 in 2004 , representing 52,589 different names			0
they then compared the names to voting returns in each neighbourhood and used these as an indication of their parents ’ political inclination			1
the study found that ‘ soft ’ sounds , like the l in ‘ @entity64 ’ , the a in ‘ @entity65 ’ or the @entity66 in ‘ @entity67 ’ were more likely to be found in areas which voted on the left			0
examples of this include ‘ @entity72 ’ or ‘ @entity73 ’ for a boy or a girl ’s name like ‘ @entity77 ’ - one of @entity49 president @entity79 ’s daughters			0
conservatives by contrast went for ‘ harder ’ sounds such as @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , names chosen by the family of former vice presidential candidate @entity84			0
true red : the names of @entity91 leader @entity44 and wife @entity92 's children , @entity0 and @entity46 , are more in keeping with his centre - left views lead researcher @entity95 , a political scientist at the @entity96 , said that the difference could be to do with perceptions of names that are linked to wealth			1
traditionally masculinity has been linked to economic success , so by giving your child a more masculine name parents could in theory be hoping they will become wealthy too			1
professor @entity95 said : ‘ the fact that we would find any kind of systematic differences , much less the magnitude of differences that we found - i really did not anticipate that			0
‘ i think most of this happens unconsciously ... underneath there is a lot of signalling going on ’			0
left wing : president @entity79 children 's names @entity122 and @entity77 indicate his left leaning another finding related to the kind of names that parents chose			1
@entity1 parents are more likely to choose an obscure name to denote status whilst conservatives usually opt for something more conventional , the study showed			2
left - wing mothers and fathers try to use obscure cultural references to inflate their social position and show how smart they are			2
what 's in a name : couples who choose more outlandish names for their children , like @entity142 and @entity143 , are more likely to be left wing this could explain why many actors and actresses , who usually have left - wing views , choose odd names for their children such as @entity143 and @entity142 who count @entity151 and @entity152 among their brood			1
conservatives by contrast tend to opt for traditional names like @entity157 , @entity158 , or @entity159 because the elites in society have them and they want their children to be part of the club			2
the findings have not yet been published but were presented at the 2013 @entity166 in @entity167 .			0

conservative voters tend to choose masculine sounding names
parents with left wing views choose more feminine names
names like @entity8 and @entity39 may indicate @entity7 is liberal
