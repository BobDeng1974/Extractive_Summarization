@entity0 feels @entity1 should not fear anybody in the last 16 of the @entity3 after his ' best goal ' helped silence the critics as the @entity6 won 4 - 1 at @entity7			1
the 23 - year - old 's sensational long - range half - volley - which was so good it was applauded by the home fans at the @entity11 and started debates about great goals on social media - made it 3 - 0 after half an hour			1
@entity17 's men delivered a commanding tuesday night display in @entity19 with a much - changed side , showing no hangover from saturday 's 3 - 2 defeat at @entity23 , which left them sixth in the @entity25			1
@entity0 ( second left ) celebrates after scoring a stunning goal against @entity7 on tuesday @entity0 's superb effort added to his neat finish inside the area after 11 minutes , and followed @entity31 's earlier opener for the visitors			1
it proved a popular talking point on @entity35 , with @entity1 forward @entity36 looking flabbergasted after the ball flew into the top corner			2
at the other end of the pitch , goalkeeper @entity39 put his head in his hands in disbelief at what he had just witnessed			0
@entity17 , meanwhile , had quipped in his post-match press conference , he felt to shoot from such a distance was ' not the right decision , but he proved me wrong ! '			0
@entity0 had remained modest in his initial reaction , but having seen the sublime finish replayed over and over again , the @entity51 midfielder hailed it as the outstanding strike of his career so far			2
' i have just seen it back , and i thought it was a lot closer , but it was quite far out and definitely my best goal now , ' @entity0 said on www.uefa.com			2
@entity0 ( left ) fires a long - range shot towards goal as @entity1 take on @entity7 in @entity19 @entity7 goalkeeper @entity64 fails to stop @entity0 's thunderbolt into the top corner despite the impressive victory , @entity1 , who had surrendered a 3 - 0 lead against @entity69 on the fourth @entity3 match day , were unable to secure top spot in @entity73 , with @entity74 going through to monday 's draw as seeds			1
that means @entity1 could again face one of @entity80 's heavyweights in the knock - out stages next year , such as defending champions @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or @entity85			1
@entity0 , though , believes the @entity6 - who expect to be boosted by the return of @entity88 and @entity89 by the next set of @entity3 fixtures in february - can go into any such tie with confidence			1
' we have done well , have qualified , we nearly came top of the group , but we finished off in style and hopefully now we will get a nice draw , ' he said			0
' on our day , we are capable of giving anyone a game , hopefully the draw is a bit more kinder to us this time			0
' @entity0 also scored @entity1 's second goal as he slots his shot past @entity64 at the @entity11 @entity0 celebrates the first of his two goals in @entity19 as @entity1 ran out 4 - 1 winners both @entity0 and midfielder @entity108 were taken off at the break with minor muscle problems , but they are expected to be available for saturday 's tea - time kick - off against @entity113 at the @entity114			1
@entity31 has been linked with a january move away from @entity1 following a lack of first - team opportunities			2
the @entity119 forward , who scored his second goal on the break deep into injury time , was happy to be back in action and helping the team			0
he told @entity124 : ' i had the chance to play and i always want to score , give assists and play well			0
' for me it was important to play 90 minutes and keep going			0
it is not always easy to come in and do well , so it was good for me to do that			0

@entity1 beat @entity7 4 - 1 in their final @entity3 group match
@entity0 feels that @entity1 should not fear anybody in the last 16
