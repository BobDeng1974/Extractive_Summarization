the musician , who is a vocal @entity6 campaigner , came under fire last week after he floated a balloon of a giant pig emblazoned with the @entity18 above the stage in @entity20			1
the move sparked fury within the international @entity10 community , including that of rabbi @entity25 , of the human rights group @entity26 , who branded the showpiece a ' grotesque display of jew - hatred '			1
video of the concert posted online shows the pig , also painted with dollar signs , the logo for oil conglomerate @entity36 and the communist hammer and sickle symbol , drifting over the crowd during the climax of the show 's finale			0
' with this disgusting display @entity4 has made it crystal clear : forget @entity45 , never mind " limited boycotts promoting @entity48 " , @entity4 is an open hater of @entity10 , ' rabbi @entity25 told @entity10 website @entity50			1
' the video is beyond shocking			0
the only books this bigot should be getting should be with the @entity54 in @entity55 and the @entity56			0
' but @entity4 almost immediately issued an impassioned retort on @entity58 , in which he called rabbi @entity25 's remarks ' so wild and bigoted they demand a response '			1
' i hold your outburst to be inflammatory and un-helpful and would suggest it can only impede progress towards peace and understanding between people , ' he writes			0
' it is also extremely insulting to me personally in that you accuse me of being ‘ @entity72 ’ , ‘ a @entity72 ’ and ‘ @entity73 ’			0
refuting the accusations , he goes on to say he also put ' the @entity75 , the @entity76 , the @entity77 and @entity78 , the @entity79 and the @entity80 , a @entity81 and a @entity83 sign ' on the pig			0
' beyond shocking ' : rabbi @entity25 of the human rights group @entity26 branded @entity87 's showpiece a ' grotesque display of jew - hatred ' @entity72 ? @entity4 came under fire last week after a balloon of a giant pig emblazoned with the @entity18 was floated above the stage in @entity20 under fire : in the concert , @entity4 is seen dressed as a dictator firing a machine gun into the audience ' @entity99 , so lamely attacked by you , ' he continues			1
it is thoughtful , life affirming , ecumenical , humane , loving , anti war , anti colonial , pro universal access to the law , pro liberty , pro collaboration , pro dialogue , pro peace , anti authoritarian , anti fascist , anti apartheid , anti dogma , international in spirit , musical and satirical			0
' he goes on : ' in a functioning theocracy it is almost inevitable that the symbol of the religion becomes confused with the symbol of the state , in this case the @entity45 , a state that operates @entity126 both within its own borders and also in the territories it has occupied and colonized since 1967			2
' to peacefully protest against @entity45 ’s racist domestic and foreign policies is not anti-semitic			1
' the row broke out after @entity5 fan @entity132 , an @entity45 expat in @entity20 , posted a video of the pig online after attending the concert			1
' i came to the concert because i really like his music , without any connection to his political stance toward @entity45 , ' he told @entity45 daily @entity141			2
' and i had a lot of fun , until i noticed the @entity18 , on the inflatable pig			2
' that was the only religious - national symbol which appeared among other symbols for fascism , dictatorships and oppression of people			0
' @entity4 crossed the line and gave expression to an anti-semitic message , beyond all his messages of anti-militancy			2

@entity4 floated giant pig with @entity18 above audience in *gig* last month
