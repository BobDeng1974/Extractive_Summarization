by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 delivered a hymn of praise to @entity5 , comparing the midfielder to a master musician in the way he times his passes and predicting he will return to his best this season			1
the @entity12 boss claimed that @entity5 , who played every game in @entity16 ’s @entity15 - winning campaign , is unfairly criticised and does not get enough credit for his achievements			1
‘ people are very harsh with @entity5 because he ’s a player who ’s always very easy on his play , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but when you watch the game again the next day you see what a player he is			0
the timing of everything he does is absolutely perfect			1
you never catch him giving the ball too late			0
the number of players you catch giving the ball too late is unbelievable			0
he ’s like a guy who plays the music , the timing of what he does is perfect , you do n’t get many players like that			2
he will never be a tackler			0
’ @entity2 added : ‘ he is not getting enough praise			2
he came back as a @entity15 winner			1
he got back ( to @entity12 ) on august 11 and he has already played two games , so after three or four weeks he will be at his best again			2
’ @entity5 , 25 , was bought from @entity38 for £ 42.5million a year ago , making him the most expensive export in @entity59 football history and @entity12 ’s biggest ever signing			1
glory : @entity5 won the @entity15 with @entity16 in @entity61 during the summer and only returned on august 11 @entity62 : @entity5 was a rising star in @entity63 with @entity38 before the £ 42.5m deal which brought him to @entity12 but his languid style has given rise to accusations of laziness , even in his homeland where former @entity16 star @entity70 called for him to be dropped before the @entity15 semi-final against @entity61 because he ‘ does nothing but walk around the pitch ’			1
there have been calls for @entity2 to bolster his squad in the final days of the transfer window , particularly up front where injured @entity80 will be unavailable until at least january			2
while he said he would ‘ remain alert ’ until the final seconds of the window , @entity2 believes his squad is strong enough without more additions			2
he also claimed bringing in too many players can deny youngsters a chance to break through			0
‘ if you always buy , you can never give a chance to a player , ’ he said			0
‘ take the example of @entity90			0
@entity90 played centre back because i gave him the chance			0
if i had bought four centre backs already i would never have played him			0
’ high five ! @entity5 celebrates with then team - mate @entity94 ( right ) as @entity38 beat @entity95 back in 2011			1

@entity12 boss @entity2 does not think @entity5 is getting praise
@entity2 says @entity15 winner is ' absolutely perfect ' with his timing
he believes @entity5 needs more games this season before he can be *judged*
the 25 - year - old @entity59 cost £ 42.5million from @entity38 last summer
@entity59 @entity70 claimed @entity5 ' does nothing but walk around the pitch '
