by @entity0 published : 20:01 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 1 november 2012 the @entity1 was in turmoil last night over the future of onshore wind power , as furious @entity5 demanded the new @entity7 energy minister is stripped of responsibility for renewable energy			1
@entity5 energy secretary @entity10 reacted with consternation after @entity12 , a sceptic on wind farms , told the @entity15 that @entity16 has had ‘ enough ’ of turbines ‘ peppered ’ across the country			1
@entity19 effectively backed his minister – who he told to ‘ deliver a win for our people ’ on wind power when he was appointed last month – telling mps it was time for a debate about the future of the technology			1
anger : @entity10 , left , reacted with consternation yesterday after @entity12 told the @entity15 that he had ' had enough ' of wind farms ‘ we have got a big pipeline of onshore and offshore wind projects coming through , ’ the prime minister said			1
‘ we are committed to those , but frankly all parties are going to have to have a debate about what happens once those targets are met			2
’ backing : @entity19 effectively put his support behind the minister by saying that it was time for a debate about the future of the technology but mr @entity10 , who had attempted to ban mr @entity12 from making his remarks public , insisted the minister could not make @entity51 policy			1
@entity5 sources said they now wanted renewable energy removed from his portfolio			1
mr @entity12 said it seemed ‘ extraordinary ’ that turbines had been erected across @entity16 with little or no regard for the views of local people			1
he added : ‘ we can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities			0
’ his remarks delighted the @entity7 benches , where 150 mps have urged the government to take a more sceptical stance over onshore wind power			0
mr @entity12 had been due to expand on his remarks in a speech to a renewable energy conference in @entity71 , but did not do so following a furious intervention from mr @entity10			1
‘ @entity12 might wish that he has the final say on energy policy and that he ’s in a single - party government – but he does n’t and he ’s not , ’ said one source close to mr @entity10			1
‘ he seemed to be mapping out @entity7 plans for their election manifesto but he was not speaking for the government			0
he did not deliver the speech because he was told it was not acceptable			0
’ other sources said mr @entity10 had told @entity83 that mr @entity12 should now be stripped of all responsibility for green energy			1
a senior @entity7 source , however , said mr @entity19 was backing his minister			0
conservative business minister @entity88 also supported mr @entity12 , insisting local communities should have the right to decide whether they accept wind farms			1
‘ we ’re not saying we absolutely have to have 4,000 onshore wind farms by a particular date			0
these things have to be determined locally , ’ he said			0
the @entity96 conceded that taking into account the number of onshore wind farms already built , those under construction and those in the pipeline , we will have enough to meet targets for 2020			0
but the @entity5 insist it is wrong to say no more turbines will be constructed once the target is reached			1
controversial : wind turbines have caused a split between the conservatives and @entity5 mr @entity10 said : ‘ there has been no change to @entity51 policy on renewable energy , as collectively agreed by the @entity1 cabinet			1
‘ onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables , which is why we ’ve been able to cut the subsidy			0
’ trade body renewable @entity16 ’s deputy chief executive , @entity120 , said : ‘ as the wind industry meets in @entity124 to celebrate the success of this industry , it comes as some surprise that the new minister has said one thing to us and another to the press			0
‘ we are on the eve of the publication of the energy bill , with huge investment decisions to be made that will lead to tens of thousands of jobs over the next decade			2
‘ if we are to see these jobs and investment realised confidence must be retained and that means consistency			0
’ but a @entity144 spokesman said mr @entity12 ’s views were compatible with policy			2
he said the government would meet its obligations to generate 15 per cent of energy from renewable resources by 2020 with windfarms ‘ already in the pipeline ’ – those with planning permission or awaiting approval			2
a senior @entity51 source said because of that , mr @entity19 could change the mix of energy sources , potentially capping windfarms before 2017			2
‘ the call for evidence includes a line that we will look at the cost of the technology , ’ he said			2
‘ that could let you change the subsidies for wind power			0
’ labour energy spokesman @entity170 said the row demonstrated @entity16 had a ‘ shambles of a @entity7 - led government which ca n’t even agree with itself ’			0
‘ onshore wind is the most developed and cheapest source of clean energy , ’ she said .			0

@entity179 says it was time for a debate about future of technology
@entity5 say they now want energy removed from @entity12 portfolio
