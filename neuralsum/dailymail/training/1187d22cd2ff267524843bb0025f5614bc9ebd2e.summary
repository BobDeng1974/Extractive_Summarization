by @entity0 published : 10:58 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 15 february 2013 the @entity2 may never have happened if @entity4 's first attempt to seize the throne from @entity6 two years earlier had not been thwarted by the weather , an academic claimed today			1
the remains of the last @entity10 king were dug up in a council car park in @entity12 last year and following a lengthy investigation were positively identified earlier this month			0
but @entity14 , a phd student at the @entity16 's @entity15 , believes @entity6 may not have met his end at @entity2 , if it had not been for the storms of october 1483			1
@entity2 , 22 august 1485 : experts now believe storms halted a previous attack after the @entity22 was flooded born in 1452 , @entity6 was @entity23 of @entity24 for two years , from 1483 until his death in 1485 during the @entity2			1
according to another tale , @entity6 consulted a seer in @entity12 before the battle who foretold that ' where your spur should strike on the ride into battle , your head shall be broken on the return '			1
on the ride into battle his spur struck the bridge stone of the @entity38 ; legend has it that , as his corpse was being carried from the battle over the back of a horse , his head struck the same stone and was broken @entity46 was the last @entity24 king to be killed in battle he was the last king of the @entity48 and the last of the @entity10 dynasty			0
although @entity6 has gone down in history as a monstrous tyrant with a hunchback and a withered arm , most historians now claim such an image is purely fictitious and down largely to how he was portrayed by @entity57			2
ms @entity14 was aware of a great storm and flood in the @entity60 in 1483 but she did not realise its historical significance until she read @entity57 's @entity63 @entity57 's play , and the chronicles that he used to research historical events , document a co-ordinated attempt to confront @entity6 in 1483			1
two armies set out , one led by the @entity69 and one by the @entity70 - later to become @entity4 - but both failed to meet with @entity6			2
@entity57 described how the @entity69 had amassed an army of @entity74 and aimed to cross the @entity22 to confront @entity6 at @entity75 but , due to flooding of the river , this became impossible : ' by sudden floods and fall of waters , @entity69 's army is dispers 'd and scatter 'd '			1
ms @entity14 also noted that the chronicles report that the @entity70 had set sail from @entity85 at the same time , with a 5,000 strong army , in an attempt to fight @entity6 for the crown , but , due to a great storm off the south west coast of @entity24 : ' the @entity92 navy [ was ] dispers 'd by tempest '			2
nobody had ever made the historical connection between the two events before			0
ms @entity14 said : ' the combination of storm and flooding in the @entity60 was a significant event and led to the drowning of more than 200 people			0
' yet it would hardly have been mentioned in the chronicles if it had n't disrupted the plans of @entity108 and @entity109			0
' the world 's only facial reconstruction of @entity6 was recently unveiled after 528 years after his remains were found in a car park in @entity12			2
here , he is face to face with his 17th generation nephew , @entity116 the @entity69 lost his head , but in 1485 the @entity70 landed safely in @entity118 and , with his strengthened army defeated @entity6 at @entity2 , to become @entity4 @entity6 was the last @entity24 monarch to fall in battle and his death brought to a close the @entity123			1
a depiction of the carnage during the @entity2 by 18th century painter @entity126 ( 1740 - 1812 ) the @entity2 was fought on the morning of august 22 , 1485 , and marked the end of the @entity123 , the 30 - year civil war between the houses of @entity48 and @entity130			1
one of the most important clashes in @entity24 history , it saw the death of @entity6 , ushered in the @entity4 dynasty and gave @entity57 one of his best known quotations			2
the leading role has been played by @entity139 and sir @entity140 , and the battle has also been immortalised in many artworks			0
the battle marked the final confrontation between the @entity48 king @entity6 and his challenger @entity4 , @entity70 and @entity146			0
the seeds of @entity6 's downfall were sown when he seized the throne from his 12 - year - old nephew @entity150 in 1483			1
support for the monarch was further diminished when @entity150 and his younger brother disappeared and @entity6 was involved in the death of his wife			0
@entity4 laid claim to the throne from across the @entity158			0
following an unsuccessful attempt to invade @entity24 from his base in @entity161 , @entity4 arrived on the coast of @entity163 on august 1 , 1485			0
gathering support as he marched inland , @entity6 hurriedly mustered troops and intercepted @entity4 's army south of @entity167 in @entity168			1
after @entity6 's death on the battlefield his rival was crowned @entity4 and became the first @entity24 monarch of the @entity4 dynasty , which lasted until 1603 .			0

@entity16 researcher believes @entity6 may not have met his end at @entity2 if it had not been for the storms of october 1483
flooding of the @entity22 stopped troops confronting the @entity23 earlier
