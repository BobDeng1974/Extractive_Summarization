@entity0 became the first man to score a double hundred in a @entity4 knockout match after propelling @entity5 to a massive first - innings lead in their quarter - final against @entity9			1
the 28 - year - old batsman was dropped in the first over before going on to score 237 off 163 balls - including 24 fours and 11 sixes , of which one found the roof of @entity17 's @entity16 in the final over			1
after posting the highest individual score in a @entity4 match , @entity0 left his team in an extremely strong position to win as they reached 393 for six			1
@entity0 was undoubtedly the star of the opening innings - but he was given an extra life in the very first over			2
just three balls in , @entity25 dropped the @entity27 and @entity0 thanked him by finding the first of his many boundaries before @entity30 fell for 12 runs , @entity9 captain @entity32 rising to the occasion to take a stunning catch at deep cover			1
@entity0 then survived two appeals for lbw , chipping away at the attack in between times , and he remained in place after @entity9 claimed their second wicket in the 16th over			0
@entity41 had put on 33 before falling to @entity42 , whose wide delivery ended up with @entity44 at short cover			0
meanwhile @entity0 was moving towards his half - century and reached it with a single from the last ball of the 20th over to put @entity5 on 105 for two			1
nothing could stop the @entity51 batsman and after making his seventh odi hundred he took off his helmet and saluted the roaring capacity crowd			0
his ton had been put together with a steady succession of fours but his first six arrived in the 36th over as he carted @entity58 to wide long - on			0
@entity0 was perhaps guilty of ball - watching when @entity60 was run out for 42 but , despite the fact the mistake would likely be overlooked due to his heroics , he made sure to atone for it by reaching his second 150 in @entity65 with a single off @entity66			2
@entity67 was then caught by an off - pace delivery from @entity42 , shuffling across to pull the ball across to @entity44 at midwicket for 15			0
@entity0 's double - ton was within reach and he wasted no time gunning for it , achieving his personal best of 192 with a four off @entity42 before partner @entity75 was dismissed on review			2
the @entity78 - born all - rounder had bolstered @entity0 's charge with 27 runs off 11 balls , including two fours and two sixes , but he was given out despite appealing @entity60 's claim for lbw			1
@entity0 ignored that disappointment to fire a four that brought him to 199 and the brink of greatness			0
then , from the first ball of the 48th over , he drilled @entity42 's delivery to long - off for a four that made @entity4 history			0
the @entity5 would lose @entity94 ( nine ) before the break , courtesy of @entity60 's yorker that ended up with @entity66 , but @entity0 was uncowed and ploughed on to register a mammoth score of 237			1
of the two sixes he hit in the final over , one travelled over 110 metres to end up on the roof of the stadium , and he left the field to a standing ovation .			0

@entity5 posted score of 393 in @entity4 quarter - final
@entity0 became first man to score double hundred in knockout game at the *tournament*
the opener scored 237 runs off 163 balls , including 24 fours and 11 sixes
but he was dropped by @entity25 just three balls in
