aid target : @entity1 , permanent secretary of the @entity2 , was given the handout last year the head of @entity6 ’s foreign aid department was handed a bonus of almost £ 20,000 as it met a target to spend billions more on overseas development			1
@entity1 , permanent secretary of the @entity2 , was given the handout last year , the ministry ’s annual report for 2013/14 shows			1
despite concerns over whether millions of pounds of aid money were being spent effectively , he received the bonus of between £ 15,000 and £ 20,000 on top of his salary of almost £ 165,000			1
critics last night said the bonus was yet another example of the aid department ’s profligacy			1
it comes after the damning conclusion of auditors that @entity2 splurged £ 1billion in only eight weeks at the end of 2013 in order to meet the @entity30 commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid			1
the @entity33 said the fact that the funds were spent so quickly raised serious questions about whether value for money was achieved			2
the @entity30 commitment to the 0.7 per cent target meant that @entity2 had to spend £ 11.46billion on aid projects in 2013			2
in june 2013 , @entity2 officials forecast that they would have to spend £ 2.7billion in november and december to hit the target			2
however , months later – under the leadership of mr @entity1 – the department found it had to spend an extra £ 1billion on top of this to hit the 0.7 per cent target			1
this extra money was then allocated to different schemes over a period of only eight weeks			0
the @entity33 report tops a series of failings at the department			0
two months ago an independent report found that @entity2 programmes were making corruption worse in @entity56 and @entity57			0
the department ’s annual report for 2013/14 also shows that @entity2 ’s director general @entity60 received a bonus of between £ 10,000 and £ 15,000 in addition to his £ 130,000 pay			1
@entity2 said the payments to mr @entity1 and mr @entity60 were based on objectives reached in the year 2012/13			2
@entity66 , @entity67 mp for @entity68 , said : ‘ people will be pretty surprised in my constituency to hear about this bonus payment			0
£ 20,000 is more than many people in @entity68 earn in a year , and many of them have had to endure pay freezes			0
‘ now we have criticism from the @entity33 saying that they gave away lots of money at the end of the year to meet the 0.7 per cent target , raising questions about value for money			2
’ the @entity2 report shows that as well as his large bonus , mr @entity1 has amassed a pension pot of almost £ 1million , entitling him to an annual payment of almost £ 60,000 when he retires			1
auditors concluded @entity2 splurged £ 1billion in only eight weeks at the end of 2013 in order to meet the @entity30 commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid the report reveals that the number of staff at @entity2 has risen by 7.3 per cent in the past year to 2,972 , despite @entity98 ’s pledge to cut the cost of government			1
the wage bill soared 8.8 per cent to £ 145.7million last year			0
at the same time , other departments ’ budgets were reduced			0
@entity104 , chief executive of the @entity105 , said : ‘ @entity2 looks like a black hole for taxpayers ’ cash			0
‘ each penny of foreign aid should go to the world ’s poorest , and the arbitrary way in which the department spends at the minute is n’t contributing enough to freedom , health or safety in the developing world			1
’ a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ the payments in question related to staff performance in the 2012/13 financial year , not 2013/14 when the @entity6 first achieved the 0.7 per cent aid target			2
' furthermore , these salaries and performance payments are funded from the core administration budget which is entirely separate from the budget which is used to finance overseas aid programmes			0
' they are paid in line with standard @entity131 rules and an independently - chaired @entity132 advises on all pay and bonus awards for @entity134			0
' he said @entity2 has reduced its admin budget by a third , reduced spending on admin consultants in @entity2 by 90 per cent , clamped down on the travel policy for staff and reformed aid spending .			0
