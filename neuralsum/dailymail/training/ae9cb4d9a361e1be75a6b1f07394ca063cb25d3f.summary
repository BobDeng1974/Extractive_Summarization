defying the @entity2 - run @entity1 , president @entity0 rejected a bill tuesday to approve construction of the @entity6 oil pipeline , wielding his veto power for only the third time in his presidency			1
@entity0 offered no indication of whether his @entity11 will eventually issue a permit for the pipeline , whose construction has become a flashpoint in the @entity17 debate about environmental policy and climate change			1
instead , @entity0 sought to reassert his authority to make the decision himself , rebuffing @entity2 lawmakers who will control both the @entity23 and @entity24 for the remainder of the president 's term			1
' but i also take seriously my responsibility to the @entity17 people			0
' @entity0 vetoed the bill in private with no fanfare , in contrast to the televised ceremony @entity2 leaders staged earlier this month when they signed the bill and sent it to the president			1
house speaker @entity52 said @entity2 were ' not even close ' to giving up the fight and derided the veto as a ' national embarrassment			2
' the move sends the politically charged issue back to @entity1 , where @entity2 have n't shown they can muster the two - thirds majority in both chambers needed to override @entity0 's veto			1
@entity62 sen. @entity61 , the bill 's chief @entity2 sponsor , said @entity2 are about four votes short in the @entity24 and need about 11 more in the @entity23			1
still , senate majority leader @entity65 indicated that he would try to bring more democrats over to his party 's side on the issue in an attempt to overturn @entity0 's veto by march 3			1
' even though the president has yielded to powerful special interests , this veto does n’t end the debate , ' @entity71 said			0
' @entity17 should know that the new @entity1 wo n’t stop pursuing good ideas , including this one			0
' although the veto is @entity0 's first since @entity2 took control on @entity80 , it was not likely to be the last			1
@entity2 lawmakers are lining up legislation rolling back @entity0 's actions on health care , immigration and financial regulation that @entity0 has promised to similarly reject			1
' he 's looking at this as showing he still can be king of the hill , because we do n't have the votes to override , ' @entity89 sen. @entity89 of @entity90 , a vocal opponent of @entity0 's climate change agenda , said in an interview with the @entity96			2
' if he vetoed this , he 's going to veto many others that are out there			0
' first proposed more than six years ago , the @entity6 pipeline project has sat in limbo ever since , awaiting a permit required by the federal government because it would cross an international boundary			0
the pipeline would connect @entity108 's tar sands with refineries on the @entity110 that specialize in processing heavy crude oil			0
republicans and the energy industry say the $ 8 billion project would create jobs , spur growth and increase @entity17 's independence from @entity119 energy sources			0
democrats and environmental groups have sought to make the pipeline a poster child for the type of dirty energy sources they say are exacerbating global warming			0
' this misguided @entity6 bill , pushed by the fossil fuel industry , has met its just and expected doom , ' @entity127 , president of the @entity128 , said in a statement following news of @entity0 's veto			1
' the president got it exactly right , ' she said			0
' @entity1 should stop wasting any more time pushing dirty energy projects that would worsen climate change and threaten our air , water and land			0
' on behalf of @entity145 , the organization 's president , @entity143 , also thanked @entity0 for striking down the @entity6 legislation			2
' the veto sends a strong message to @entity1 that the government should represent the interests of the @entity17 people instead of @entity152			2
' house speaker @entity52 of @entity153 , seated , held a public ceremony to sign the bill authorizing expansion of the @entity6 just before @entity1 left for a week - long recess on feb. 13			2
republicans did not send the legislation to @entity0 until tuesday , however			2
he quickly vetod it in private			0
it was only the third veto of @entity0 's presidency for his part , @entity0 says his administration is still weighing the pipeline 's merits , and he has repeatedly threatened to veto any attempts by lawmakers to make the decision for him			1
the president 's spokesman told reporters today that the veto was not the president taking ' a specific position on the pipeline itself			1
' rather , it is him handing off the decision to experts within the administration			0
' it does not represent a final disposition of the @entity6 project , ' @entity23 press secretary @entity180 said			0
in a statement to @entity1 today explaining his veto , @entity0 said he was opposing the bill because ' this act of @entity1 conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest -- including our security , safety , and environment			1
' that message was all but lost on @entity2 , who accused @entity0 in a barrage of attacks on tuesday , of playing politics and kowtowing to environmental groups			2
recently elected @entity204 sen. @entity203 called the president 's veto ' ridiculous			2
' @entity208 's senior senator , @entity207 , contended that the move was ' just sheer political spite			0
' the @entity211 sent reporters an email blasting @entity0 as the ' obstructor in chief			2
' ' there is simply no reason whatsoever for the president not to approve this project that will create thousands of jobs for @entity17 workers and put our country one step closer to energy independence , ' @entity217 sen. @entity216 said			0
@entity110 rep. @entity228 said @entity0 was putting the ' priorities of radical environmentalists ahead of the needs and priorities of hardworking @entity17 families			0
' president @entity0 's veto is a triumph of politics over common sense , ' @entity235 rep. @entity234 said			1
' his own @entity11 completed five reviews , totaling more than 22,000 pages , and concluded that the @entity6 is a project that will create jobs , and actually improve safety and the environment			0
' the only possible reason to oppose the project is politics , ' he concluded			0
the president 's spokesman told reporters today that the veto was not the president taking ' a specific position on the pipeline itself			1
' rather , it is him handing off the decision to experts within the administration the @entity2 - controlled @entity23 passed the bill earlier in february on a 270 - 152 vote , following weeks of debate and tweaks in the @entity24 to insert language stating that climate change is real and not a hoax			1
@entity2 leaders in @entity1 delayed sending the bill to the @entity23 until they returned from a weeklong recess , ensuring they would be on hand to denounce the president when he vetoed the bill			1
the veto forced @entity2 , still reveling in their dramatic gains in the midterm elections , to confront the limitations of being unable to turn their ideas into law without the president 's consent - despite the fact they now control both chambers of @entity1			1
@entity2 leaders were mulling a number of potential next steps			0
in addition to trying to peel off enough @entity288 to override @entity0 's veto - an unlikely proposition - republicans were considering inserting @entity6 into other critical legislation dealing with energy , spending or infrastructure in hopes that @entity0 would be less likely to veto those priorities , @entity61 , said			1
' we 'll look to see if we can get some more bipartisan support , ' the @entity62 lawmaker noted			0
@entity0 last wielded his veto power in october 2010 , nixing a relatively mundane bill dealing with recognition of documents notarized out of state			2
with the @entity6 bill , @entity0 's veto count stands at just three - far fewer than most of his predecessors			1
yet his veto threats have been piling up rapidly since @entity2 took full control of @entity1 , numbering more than a dozen so far this year			1
the president has said he wo n't approve @entity6 if it 's found to significantly increase @entity17 emissions of carbon dioxide , the chief greenhouse gas blamed for global warming			0
a @entity11 analysis found that the tar sands would be developed one way or another , meaning construction of the pipeline would n't necessarily affect emissions			2
the @entity322 earlier this month called for that analysis to be revisited , arguing that a drop in oil prices may have altered the equation .			0

it is only the third veto of @entity0 's presidency ; with @entity2 now in control of both chambers of @entity1 it 's unlikely to be his last
the @entity23 had said many times that the president would not sign the legislation - he believes the @entity11 should make the decision
the veto was not the president taking ' a specific position on the pipeline itself , ' @entity0 's spokesman told reporters today
*keystone* backers do not make up a large enough majority of the @entity23 or @entity24 to overturn a veto but @entity2 plan to try
