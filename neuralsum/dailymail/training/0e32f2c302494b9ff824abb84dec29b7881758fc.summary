by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:14 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 20:14 est , 20 november 2013 one of @entity3 ’s most senior police officers broke ranks yesterday to admit that crime figures can not be trusted			1
@entity6 said officers at every level are ‘ inadvertently ’ manipulating statistics because of the huge pressure to cut crime			1
the @entity13 chief said an ‘ obsession ’ with measuring police performance over more than a decade has left a legacy of unwitting corruption			1
statistics : police minister @entity20 said crime figures can not be relied on he was backed by other senior colleagues who said different forces are ‘ inconsistent ’ in how they log the trail of misery left by criminals			1
they said many crimes from rape to bicycle theft and criminal damage are grossly under - reported , sometimes because victims lack confidence in police			1
meanwhile other fast - emerging threats such as child exploitation and abuse , as well as internet fraud and blackmail are left off official figures			0
speaking at a meeting of police chiefs , mr @entity6 said levels of domestic violence and rape would soar if the ‘ utter reality ’ of crime was revealed			1
‘ inadvertently , i think , we are still putting pressure on officers to do all they can to manipulate and create crime reductions , ’ he said			1
‘ the truth is if we really wanted to get to get the position in crime we would see a massive increase in domestic violence			0
‘ it is whether we have the nerve to step away from crime reductions and the obsession with crime figures and move to a real environment where we do properly record			1
‘ it is sadly what is told to me by many forces still is that everything people do everything they can to make sure crime is not going up			0
‘ the consequence is another threat to integrity			0
this is inadvertently caused by what we have done over the past decade			0
‘ i do n’t think they do it because they are inherently corrupt , they are doing it because the pressure is on to reduce crime			1
’ mr @entity6 ’s unusually candid comments highlighted a rift between the government and the highest ranks of police			1
they came amid reports that some forces are experiencing a rise in overall crime for the first time in many years			0
the @entity90 says it has removed all police targets to remove red tape and enable police to be ‘ single - minded crime fighters ’			2
but forces are still measured by their performance on key offences and chiefs said this creates a relentless pressure to record as few crimes as possible			1
earlier this week a serving @entity103 officer sparked a furore when he told a parliamentary committee that crimes are disappearing in a ‘ puff of smoke ’			0
accuracy : senior colleagues of mr @entity6 said forces were inconsistent when it came to logging the trail of misery left by criminals ( file picture ) mps were told official statistics are routinely massaged by officers desperate to show they are making the streets safer			1
at yesterday ’s meeting of the @entity121 ( @entity121 ) , police minister @entity20 was told crime figures simply can not be relied upon			2
sir @entity123 , who heads @entity124 , said the drive to give frontline officer more discretion has led to different interpretations of how crimes are logged			0
he said : ‘ we all know , essentially , that recorded crime is unreliable statistically because there are so many variations in it			0
‘ it is not about ‘ fiddling ’ figures , when you look at the more minimal type of crime there is a large field of interpretation about whether they are crimes or not			2
’ but mr @entity20 reacted angrily , telling chief constables that massaging crime figures crosses a ‘ thick red line ’ and is ‘ straight - forwardly unacceptable ’			2
he said that politicians do n’t try and win elections by ‘ fiddling the votes ’ and that he is ‘ surprised and disappointed ’ by the claims			0
asked if crime figures are accurate , mr @entity20 replied : ‘ in most cases they are			0
we will be looking very carefully at what we have heard			0
’ the police watchdog , @entity158 , is undertaking a review of how all forces record crime			2
it is expected to uncover widespread discrepancies in whether specific incidents should be categorised as a crime , and if so , what offence took place			0
@entity169 chief constable @entity168 , who is the national lead on crime figures , admitted performance targets have created ‘ perverse incentives ’			1
but he said in many cases officers do not record offences in the ‘ public interest ’ , for example over a playground dispute or when a child steals from home			0
other reasons for poor or inaccurate recording could ‘ lack of awareness ’ , work pressure and professional discretion , he added			2
mr @entity168 said : ‘ nobody joins the police service with the intention of recording crime inaccurately			2

@entity6 said statistics are manipulated *due* to pressure to cut crime
@entity13 chief constable said there is an ' obsession ' with performance
claimed crimes are under reported because victims lack confidence in the police
