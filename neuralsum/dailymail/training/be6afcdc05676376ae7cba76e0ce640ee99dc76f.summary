@entity7 president @entity6 unveiled the extraordinary proposal yesterday , as he outlined his latest plans for the next seven - year @entity3 budget			1
mr @entity6 initially suggested that the @entity1 could keep the £ 3.2 billion - a - year rebate famously secured by @entity12			1
@entity14 president @entity6 's plan to dramatically cut @entity1 's @entity3 rebate is likely to anger @entity16 an @entity3 diplomat said there was an acceptance among negotiators that ending @entity1 ’s rebate would scupper any chance of a deal , adding : ‘ people realise that no @entity1 prime minister can go back to the @entity26 and defend having given up the rebate			1
’ but detailed proposals revealed that @entity1 would be expected to contribute to its own rebate in future			1
officials refused to say how much money would be involved			0
but if the payment is made at the @entity1 ’s standard 13 per cent @entity3 contribution , it would cost £ 416 million a year , or almost £ 3 billion over the seven - year period			1
however , according to new documents the @entity3 president wants to go even further and impose a 25 per cent cut for 2014 to 2020 , costing a total of £ 5.6 billion			2
@entity1 government sources last night insisted that the rebate - which was watered down by @entity43 - was ‘ non-negotiable ’			1
a senior source also rejected a ‘ compromise ’ budget proposal which would see funding for the @entity3 rise by more than the rate of inflation			0
@entity16 has indicated he will veto anything that goes beyond a real - terms freeze when the budget negotiations begin in @entity5 later this month			0
‘ our position is extremely clear , ’ the source said			0
‘ the prime minister has said he wants a budget freeze at worst and , with his veto last year , he has demonstrated he is serious about this			0
’ mps voted earlier this month for the @entity3 budget to be cut			0
in 1984 the then - prime minister @entity12 secured the rebate by banging the table and demanding ' our own money back ' @entity68 mp @entity67 described mr @entity6 ’s proposals as ‘ ludicrous ’			1
mr @entity67 said : ‘ a rebate that we have to pay for ourselves is not a rebate			0
it is a complete non-starter and suggests that they are not serious about achieving a deal - it is just unacceptable			0
‘ there has been a parting of the ways between the @entity3 leadership and the @entity1 people , and the gap is now so wide it is hard to see how a deal can be done			2
’ mr @entity6 ’s lastest proposals represent a modest reduction in the original one trillion euros ( £ 800 billion ) demanded by @entity5			2
but a real terms freeze would require a cut of up to £ 160 billion in the plans - much further than mr @entity6 is willing to go			1
@entity1 sources believe a deal is possible on a budget freeze this month , but unlikely			2
‘ a freeze is possible , but the landing pad is the size of a postage stamp and it ’s covered in trip wires , ’ a source said			0
’ officials believe it is more likely that this month ’s summit will result in a stand - off , with a decision delayed until next year			0
sources in @entity5 have suggested the summit could even be cancelled to allow mr @entity6 to save face			0
@entity1 owes it @entity3 rebate to @entity12 ’s famously tough negotiating stance in @entity110			1
in 1984 the then prime minister secured the rebate by banging the table and demanding ‘ our own money back ’ during a summit with @entity110 leaders in @entity116 , in @entity117			2
when she threatened to withhold @entity1 ’s annual payments to @entity5 , fellow @entity3 leaders eventually caved in			0
in the intervening years the deal has been worth tens of billions of pounds to @entity122 gave away a large chunk of the rebate during negotiations on the last seven - year budget deal .			1
