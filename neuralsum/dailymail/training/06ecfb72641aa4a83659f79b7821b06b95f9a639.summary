@entity7 , 32 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity4 , has spent the last five years driving across @entity4 to capture ' humble ' rest stops			1

a photographer has embarked on a journey to capture the remaining rest stops on the roadsides of @entity4 before they vanish ; pictured here is a stop near @entity20 , @entity9 the @entity21 , @entity22 offers passers - by incredible views of the landscape each of the rest - stops display a very inque style of architecture ; here is a stop near @entity32 , @entity9 ' my inspiration was the structures themselves , ' said miss @entity7			1
' i am a big fan of mid-century architecture and can usually spot it when i see it			0
when i moved to @entity9 , eight years ago , and started noticing these old stops set out on gorgeous minimalist landscapes , i was instantly inspired			1
' there are tables shaded by faux oil rigs , teepees and wagon wheels , and geometric shapes echoing classic mid-century design			0
they are a really great example of @entity51			0
' the results of her documentation show that rest stops vary in design and usually take influences from the state , town or city			1
astop near @entity62 , @entity22 might be a good place to shield yourself from any extreme weather conditions this stop near @entity8 , @entity66 looks like it could become more like a sauna should the sun reach full strength this resting place in @entity72 , @entity22 is dwarfed by snow - covered mountains in the background miss @entity7 said : ' think people will learn how historically significant these unassuming stops are and i do n't think a lot of people realize how unique the design of each stop is until you look at dozens of them at a time			1
i think most people will also find beauty in something they never expected to when they slow down and take a good look			0
' when i started the project i did a little research and was alarmed to read that they were currently being closed and demolished all over the country			0
i immediately felt an urgency to document as many as i could , as quickly as i could			0
it was also really interesting to find out how much thought went into these stops			2
' when @entity98 designed the @entity99 in 1956 , it standardized highway design from coast to coast			0
the one element that stayed within the jurisdiction of the states , however , was their rest stop design			2
@entity4 really took advantage of that and used the best architects and designers , and their creativity , to design stops that represented the different regions of their state and their cultural and historical significance			2
' this stop near @entity118 , @entity66 is of the more simple style , and would just about fit a family of four under cover it may not have walls , but this stop at @entity126 , @entity124 does at least have a roof to protect from any rain or snow this stop at the @entity132 , @entity130 might not be the prettiest , but it looks of sturdy nature a stop near @entity135 , @entity9 ; @entity7 , 32 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity4 , has spent the last five years driving across @entity4 to capture humble rest stops miss @entity137 is now aiming to create a book of all the rest stops , called ' @entity142 - a photo book of @entity4 's @entity141 ' by december next year with her project still ongoing			1
all of the locations will be captioned , along with their gps coordinates , with plans for a historian to write an essay for the book			0
miss @entity7 , who is sometimes accompanied by her mother on her trips , will continue to document more rest stops into the @entity155			1
she added : ' when i tell people i am working on a project documenting rest stops , a lot of them look at me funny as they are probably picturing dirty toilets and truck drivers			2
the shade at this stop in @entity166 , @entity130 is just what is needed on the desert landscape that can reach sweltering point @entity7 's journey has seen photograph over 150 rest stops , including this one near @entity173 , @entity22 , while driving over 20,000 miles across 17 states you 'd better hope there 's not too many weary travellers at this stop near @entity179 , @entity130 , with space at a premium resembling an old - style jail cell , this stop at @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity130 retains a certain style ' once i show them a few of the photos though , they get it immediately and love the project			1
people love to point out which ones they 've been to and share their stories and memories of visiting these stops			0
' my mom joined me on almost all of the trips			0
we are great travel buddies and the trips with her were so much fun			0
she would just sit in a chair and read while i shot the rest stops			2
