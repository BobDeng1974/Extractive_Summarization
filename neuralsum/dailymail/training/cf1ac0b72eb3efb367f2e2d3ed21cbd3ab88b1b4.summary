by @entity0 published : 18:57 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 21:24 est , 9 november 2013 when @entity4 revealed in 2010 that the vegetables and fruits that @entity7 eat everyday are extremely toxic , with chemical content that could cause serious health problems , the @entity1 of its own accord told the state government to review the situation			1
the government literally watered down the report , telling the court that the food was perfectly safe and that the @entity4 's figures were hugely exaggerated			1
now , in a stinging and embarrassing no - trust vote against the @entity7 government , the @entity1 has told the government to conduct toxicity tests over again			1
fears : pesticide chemicals are used as ripening and colouring agents for fruit and vegetables			2
recent reports claim that poisons found on vegetables and fruits had the lethal potential to cause cancer not just that , it has also asked a court - appointed expert committee as well as an amicus curiae ( assistant to the court ) for a much larger sample to be tested and also a checklist of preventive measures			0
the court 's order came on november 6 , the last date of hearing in the matter			0
the order followed a submission by the @entity7 government earlier this week stating that the pesticide content present in fruits and vegetables being sold in the capital was within permissible limits and that they were not harmful			2
@entity4 found that pesticides such as chlordane , endrin and heptachlor ( which can cause serious neurological problems , kidney damage and skin diseases ) were rampantly being used in fruits and vegetables supplied across @entity7			1
the chemicals are used as ripening and colouring agents			0
it also said that poisons found on the vegetables and fruits had the lethal potential to cause cancer			0
the @entity4 found several banned pesticides as well and the level of some of the pesticides were 750 times that of @entity75 standards			1
the court 's own panel of experts had told the @entity79 that it had visited markets in @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 and found pesticides , toxic colours and hormones present in the samples it had checked			2
the court had ordered an inspection of fruits and vegetables for pesticides content while hearing a @entity98 on may 29			0
when the government went back to court , its reply said that the amount of pesticides consumed through fruits and vegetables in @entity105 was a fraction of that in @entity108 and @entity75			1
this , it claimed , had been deduced by several sample surveys carried out by its lab. it also submitted that the @entity116 department picked up 88 samples since january this year and the report on 70 items suggests that the pesticide content in them was less			2
" the quantity of pesticides in these samples is under the consumable limits and did not pose any health - related threat , " it said			0
in addition to this , the government also submitted a report by the agricultural marketing department on 1,513 samples of fruits and vegetables containing pesticides within the " prescribed range "			0
@entity139 of @entity4 told @entity140 that " major pesticide manufacturers have started discrediting our notion that pesticide residuals are high in content present in the vegetables and fruits and it also appears that the government 's effort to whitewash our fight showing that there is indeed alarming presence "			1
he also claimed that the @entity4 was threatened with a rs 25 crore legal notice , asking it to withdraw stories about pesticides from the media			1
but the high court seemed to agree with the @entity4 about the government 's attempt to underplay the extent of pesticides and toxins in the fruits and vegetables and junked the state 's plea			1
the court said " â€¦ we find these pleadings surprising because the material brought on record before us shows a picture which is far from what is painted in the affidavit			0
@entity177 pesticides have been found in the vegetables in the national capital territory			0
" the court directed the government to test more samples and come up with definite ways to curb the use of harmful pesticides by february 5 , 2014 , the next date of hearing .			0

@entity1 orders the government to conduct toxicity tests again
@entity4 claims government sample not large enough
chemicals linked to brain problems , kidney damage and skin diseases
pesticide levels is 750 times that of @entity75 standards
*campaigners* faced with a rs 25 crore legal notice from pesticide industry
