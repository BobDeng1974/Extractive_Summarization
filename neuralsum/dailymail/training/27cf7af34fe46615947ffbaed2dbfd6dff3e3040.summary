@entity0 has resigned his membership of the @entity2 and will be unable to play in any future @entity3 unless he rejoins			1
the gifted @entity4 , who once rose as high as no 3 in the world , delivered the shock news after opening his season at the @entity9 in @entity10 on the @entity11 with a terrific first round of 62 on thursday			1
the 37 - year - old was a member of the @entity2 for 13 years and served on the @entity14 for plenty of those			2
but the 13 - time winner will concentrate on playing in @entity17 this season because he wants to cut down on travelling , after becoming a father for the first time last year			2
@entity0 shot a sparkling 62 during the first round of the @entity9 in @entity10 on thursday @entity0 is a talented ball - striker and has been ranked as high as no 3 in the world world ranking : no 78 career high world ranking : no 3 @entity26 appearances : 2004 , 2006 , 2008 professional wins : 16 @entity2 wins : 13 ( includes @entity28 2006 , @entity29 2009 ) best major finish : 3rd at @entity31 , 2010 other : @entity32 2001 @entity33 2006 ‘ for as long as i have been a professional i have been a member of the @entity2 , so it was a very tough decision , ’ he said			1
‘ but i live in @entity36 and playing in @entity17 full - time will enable me to spend more time at home with @entity39 ( his wife ) and @entity42 ( his son )			2
that ’s really become the focus for me			0
’ @entity0 played in three successive @entity3 from 2004 and was unlucky not to get a wild card in 2010 , when he was the world no 7			1
he could decide to rejoin the @entity2 next year but , with the @entity26 qualifying process beginning in september , he would be giving everyone else a four - month head start			1
ironically enough , his decision comes against the background of leading @entity17 @entity53 going the other way and committing to membership of the @entity2 , with @entity56 likely to follow suit			1
@entity0 ( centre right ) with other members of @entity60 's @entity26 winning team at the @entity62 in 2006 @entity0 became the only man ever to win a @entity26 match with a hole - in - one at the @entity62 however , to be fair to @entity0 , their circumstances are different			1
the two @entity17 are comfortably ranked inside the world ’s top 50 , and so gain entry to all the majors and @entity73 events that count for membership on both tours			1
@entity0 is presently ranked 70th , and it ’s much harder to play both tours with that ranking , where there are no guarantees			2
@entity0 acknowledged it was difficult to miss the @entity83 @entity82 , where he has won twice in the past			0
‘ i stewed over that one for a long time and believe me it was n’t a decision that i took lightly , ’ he said			0
while one course specialist is absent , another has set an imposing target for everyone else over the weekend			0
@entity92 has already won this event three times and has become a hot favourite to win it again after following up his brilliant first round 64 with a 67 on friday to reach a fabulous total of 13 under par. in winning the @entity99 last june he showed what a formidable frontrunner he is when he built on two opening rounds of 65 to walk away from the field over the weekend			0
it would be no surprise if he repeated the trick			0
@entity92 built up a five - shot advantage over the other players in his half of the field and piled on the pressure on the likes of world no 1 @entity115 and @entity56 , who were both late starters on friday and who began their second rounds at five under			0
one high - profile player who could n’t keep pace was @entity92 ’s playing partner , @entity119			0
he finished on a total of two under after a second round 69 and faced an anxious wait to see if it was good enough to make the halfway cut .			0

@entity0 has resigned his membership of the @entity2
former world @entity128 wants to play more in the @entity17
decision means he will be *unavailable* for @entity26 *selection*
