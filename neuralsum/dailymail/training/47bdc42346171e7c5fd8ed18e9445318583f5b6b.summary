@entity0 , the world 's favorite capitalist board game , was first invented by a left - wing campaigner as a protest against the unbridled thirst for profit , a new book claims			1
@entity8 , the daughter of a progressive newspaper publisher from @entity10 , filed a legal claim for her landlord 's game in 1903 , 30 years before @entity14 began manufacturing @entity0			1
her story disputes the origin myth sometimes distributed with the game , which claims @entity18 came up with @entity0 in the 1930s , saving himself and @entity20 from ruin			1
these powerful businessmen , including such figures as @entity40 and @entity41 , controlled much of the @entity30 economy in the nineteenth century , when there were massive disparities of wealth between rich and poor			0
@entity8 was inspired to create the game by the theories of @entity48 , an economist and politician			1
he advocated for the institution of a single ' land - value tax ' to shift the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy landlords			0
each person legitimately owns 100 per cent of the value they create , said @entity48 , but natural resources , common opportunities and , most importantly , the value of land , belongs equally to each person in a community			0
@entity8 had learned of @entity48 's theories from her father , who once ran for office in @entity10 on an anti-monopoly ticket , but it was n't until she was 37 and living with friends in @entity71 that she finally perfected her game			2
she was granted @entity73 for @entity75 's game on january 5 , 1904			0
in 1906 , she moved to @entity76 where she and fellow @entity77 formed the @entity78 to self - publish her invention			0
@entity31 wrote : ' she created two sets of rules for her game : an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created , and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents			0
' her dualistic approach was a teaching tool meant to demonstrate that the first set of rules was morally superior			0
' pretender : @entity18 , left , earned millions after he took the essence of @entity8 's game and sold a modified version to @entity20			1
@entity96 is a recent issue of the @entity99 version of the board game despite a lack of major financial backing , @entity8 's game quickly spread among left - wing intellectuals , particularly in the @entity104 , @entity31 wrote			1
college students also took it up , many of them apparently making their own boards according to the rules @entity8 laid out			0
but it was after it spread to a @entity113 community in @entity114 , @entity115 , that @entity8 began to lose control of her invention			2
it was this version , which included various modifications including the @entity114 neighborhoods on @entity20 ' first issues of the game , that was picked up by @entity18			1
@entity18 pitched his version of the game to @entity20 , who snapped it up			1
the company then struck a deal with @entity8 to buy out her landlord 's @entity25 patent , as well as two more of her game ideas			2
as the game grew in popularity , @entity8 was gradually pushed aside , despite her public protestations			2
eventually , even after newspaper reports in which she presented original game boards to prove she was the game 's true creator , her progressive set of rules was dispensed with			1
by the 1970s , the false notion that the game had been created solely by @entity18 had become more than popular folklore : it was printed in the game 's instructions			2
even now , a potted history of @entity0 on the website of @entity148 , the toy giant that currently owns the rights , makes no mention of its history prior to 1935			0
despite the eclipse of her socially progressive take on the @entity0 board game , it seems that @entity8 anticipated one of the game 's most - notorious effects - family rows over the unfair behavior of players to opponents who find themselves in hard times			1
in a commentary on @entity25 given to the @entity165 in 1902 , she wrote : ' there are those who argue that it may be a dangerous thing to teach children how they may thus get the advantage of their fellows , but let me tell you there are no fairer - minded beings in the world than our own little @entity30 children			0
' watch them in their play and see how quick they are , should any one of their number attempt to cheat or take undue advantage of another , to cry , " no fair ! " and who has not heard almost every little girl say , " i wo n't play if you do n't play fair			0
" ' let the children once see clearly the gross injustice of our present land system and when they grow up , if they are allowed to develop naturally , the evil will soon be remedied			0
' @entity8 's role in the genesis of @entity0 was uncovered by a economics professor during a long legal battle against @entity20			1
@entity200 found @entity8 's patents after the company tried to stop him producing his own anti-monopoly game in 1973			2
they entered court record and helped him finally win a @entity207 case against @entity20			0
but it was too late for @entity8 , who died in relative obscurity in 1948 , a widow without children , having made just $ 500 from her idea .			1

@entity8 came up with @entity0 as a protest against capitalism
her original game became a cult *classic* among @entity220 left - wingers
but in the 1930s @entity18 sold a modified version to @entity20
he became a millionaire , but @entity8 made just $ 500 from her invention
