but today the @entity4 leader said he believes in the power of love , adding that it is the whole meaning of life			1
mr @entity0 made the comments while giving a speech at the @entity11 on the same day it was claimed a @entity4 army convoy of 32 tanks crossed into the @entity15 despite the @entity16 vowing to keep a fragile truce			1
pictured : pro-russian tanks near the town of @entity32 near @entity33 early last week crossing the border : a @entity4 army convoy with 32 tanks has entered @entity15 despite a ceasefire , @entity15 's military claimed today			1
pictured : a tank being used by @entity41 separatists in @entity15 on october 28 addressing the gathered audience , he started speaking about love saying it is at the heart of his philosophy			1
according to the @entity49 , he said : ' the meaning of our whole life and existence is love			2
' it is love to the family , to the children , to the motherland			0
this phenomenon is complicated , it lies at heart of any of our behaviours			0
' but despite talking about matters of the heart , @entity15 's military has today claimed that a fleet of @entity4 tanks including 16 howitzer artillery systems and 30 trucks containing ammunition and fighters crossed the border			1
if true it is the latest blow to a truce between @entity41 separatists and @entity15 's military which has already been broken several times			2
@entity0 was visiting @entity76 in @entity20 , pictured , when he made the comments @entity28 's army spokesman @entity27 told a televised briefing the incursion happened yesterday , adding : ' the deployment continues of military equipment and @entity4 mercenaries to the front lines			1
' supplies of military equipment and enemy fighters from the @entity4 are continuing '			2
meanwhile earlier , mr @entity0 had also explained that there was nothing wrong with @entity21 's deal with @entity91 to divide up @entity22 in 1939 because the @entity22 did the same thing with the @entity93 in 1938			1
@entity0 met with students and history teachers at the @entity76 in @entity20 to discuss a range of issues concerning the @entity98 and @entity99			1
he also addressed the ongoing crisis in @entity15			2
he said it was important that @entity4 academics were involved in attempts to re-write the history of the 20th century so the impact of the @entity106 was not forgotten			1
commenting on the weeks leading up to @entity99 , @entity0 said : ' but i completely agree with you that we need to fully study this period , as well as others			2
why ? that period is also interesting			0
@entity0 urged @entity4 academics to get involved in attempts to rewrite the history of the 20th century so the impact of the @entity106 is not forgotten or underplayed by western historians and academics ' because before that , we had the so - called @entity26 in 1938			1
and what is it ? incidentally , your colleagues in western nations hush it up			0
' @entity124 arrived , shook his paper and said , “ i brought you peace ” when he returned to @entity129 after the talks			2
to which @entity132 , i believe , in private , stated , “ well , now the war is inevitable			0
” ' because appeasement of the aggressor , which @entity137 was , would clearly lead to a major future military conflict , and some people understood that			2
there should be a deep multilateral study of what was happening before @entity99 ' @entity0 attempted to claim there was a difference between the @entity26 and the non-aggression deal between the @entity106 and @entity137			1
@entity0 said that @entity21 , left , needed time to rearm before he could successfully fight @entity91 , right he said : ' for example , there are still arguments about the @entity150 , and the @entity106 is blamed for dividing @entity22			1
but what did @entity22 itself do , when the @entity151 invaded @entity25 ? it took part of @entity25			0
and then , in turn , the same thing happened to @entity22			0
' i do not want to blame anyone here , but serious studies should show that these were the foreign policy methods at the time			0
the @entity106 signed a non-aggression agreement with @entity137			0
they say , “ oh , how bad			0
” but what is so bad about it , if the @entity106 did not want to fight ? what is so bad ? ' @entity0 said : ' we can not deny the enormous input of our allies into the victory over @entity137			1
but we must compare the victims sacrificed at the altar of this common victory , the efforts and significance			0
' and to do this , we simply need to restore some information : how many @entity151 divisions were on the @entity182 , and how many fought on the @entity183 ? simply the number of tanks , artillery , planes on the @entity182 and the @entity183			2
we simply need to talk about this , to repeat it again , to count			0
but to do this , of course , we must work in the archives			0
' he also said it was necessary to compare the 25 million victims in the @entity106 to the combined allied losses			0
@entity0 said it was important that history properly recorded the sacrifice of the @entity4 people during conflict @entity0 claimed that even @entity205 historians acknowledge that without @entity4 in 1914 , @entity203 would have fallen addressing the @entity207 , @entity0 suggests that @entity4 intervention into the conflict saved @entity203			1
he said : ' it is very interesting to show the real events of @entity207 this is exceedingly important in understanding the relationship between nations , peoples and governments			0
after all , the allies were playing the game , they were competing against one another , but they also helped one another			0
' for example , at the time , everyone knew and said , and nobody denies it today , that @entity4 saved @entity203 with its offense			1
' we must give credit to the allies that in 1915 , when the @entity4 army suffered a defeat , the allies gathered and began offensive actions at the cost of enormous losses – granted , they did not achieve a result , but they did it			1
and all of this ought to be discussed , but in order to discuss it , it must be researched			0
