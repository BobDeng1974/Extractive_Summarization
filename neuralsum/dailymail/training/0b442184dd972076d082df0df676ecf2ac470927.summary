@entity0 , 20 , a marine biologist student at the @entity1 of @entity2 was swept out to sea friday off the coast of @entity5			1
@entity0 was on a school trip and decided to do some early - morning coral collecting when her leg cramped and the tide pulled her away from the reef , starting a 16 - hour nightmare that would leave @entity0 hallucinating from dehydration with severe sunburns , jellyfish stings and blisters			1
miraculously , she made it back to shore alive - by herself			2
but while she was swimming alone in the coral reefs around @entity29 , she started cramping in her stomach and leg and was pushed out to sea by the ocean currents			1
at first @entity0 thought it would be safer to try and stay in the same place , thinking that her group would soon notice her missing and send search and rescue crews after her			1
after two hours of idling and no sign of other life , she decided she would have to swim back herself			1
just keep swimming : the red line shows @entity0 ' path out to sea , while the green line charts her swim back			1
the short blue line is the route locals took to kayak her back to her resort ' it 's kind of strange because even when i did n't feel like i was strong enough , there was enough of me that still wanted to keep going			2
it did n't seem like a choice			0
i just - i had to keep going , ' @entity0 told @entity56			1
and kept going she did			0
sixteen hours after she first went out to snorkel , she made it back to land where locals found her and kayaked her back to the resort she was staying at			1
it turns out that her group had noticed she was missing when she did n't turn up to breakfast at 7:30am			0
@entity65 , the professor supervising the trip , notified authorities and rescue boats were out in the water searching for @entity0 twenty minutes later			1
' i was furious with her when we realized she had gone out with herself			0
she knows better , ' @entity65 said			0
' the search was immediately on			0
' the rescue team grew to include 100 people by noon , including officials from two governments , coast guards , scuba divers , kayakers and locals on all the islands			0
but when no one spotted @entity0 everyone grew to fear the worst			2
when the locals brought back @entity0 , her professor still could n't believe her student was alive			1
' my first reaction was i thought they were bringing back her body , because it was so long and it was dark			2
then , one of my students came out and said , " she 's alive ! she 's alive ! " ' @entity65 said			0
' everyone broke out in tears and grabbed her			0
' @entity65 is going to make sure that an event like that never happens again under her watch			0
next year she plans to make it mandatory for students to wear bright orange life vests when out snorkeling , and is even thinking about gps devices that track the students in the water			0
' bottom line , though , do n't go out by yourself , ' she said			0
it had been a long sixteen hours for @entity0			1
she endured severe sunburns , jellyfish stings , blisters , and hallucinations from dehydration , but is alive and recovering at her grandmother 's house in @entity2			2
' i 'm safe , well loved , and ready to take a break from the beach for a while , ' @entity0 wrote on @entity116			2
