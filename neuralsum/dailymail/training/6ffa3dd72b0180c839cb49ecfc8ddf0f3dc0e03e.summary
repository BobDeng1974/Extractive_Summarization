she endures up to six hours of sexual arousal a day and once had more than 180 orgasms in just two hours			1
but mother @entity3 , 30 , from @entity4 said the rare condition which causes intense waves of pleasure is ' ruining her life ' as she is house - bound and can not work			1
she was diagnosed with persistent genital arousal disorder three years ago and became reclusive after having spontaneous orgasms in the supermarket , on the school run and even in the playground			1
' it is embarrassing and confusing and humiliating , ' she said			0
' when you are around children you feel like a pervert because you have all these really strong feelings rushing through your body at the same time			0
' so if imagine you ca n't help out in class or go on school trips because the kids do n't understand , the parents do n't understand			0
' even doing the school run is a worry because the arousal will build and build and i just have to stay in the car until it is over or try and mask it			1
' it has devastated my involvement in my son 's life because i feel too dirty to be a part of it			1
we want him to be a normal kid but at the same time he ca n't have friends around because mom has this condition			1
' the worst thing is i ca n't explain it to him because he 's too young			0
' she developed the condition suddenly while grocery shopping three years ago			1
walking through the store she suddenly found herself aroused by everything she saw , smelt and touched			0
the mother - of - one began to panic and the arousal continued until she fell to the floor and orgasmed multiple times			2
' it was one of the most intense orgasms i had ever had and it was with no assistance , ' she said			0
' i was frightened and confused , i just ran out of the store and as i drove home i kept orgasming			0
she had a 10 - year - old son @entity24 and said she is now too embarrassed to do the school run ' this was the first time and it was six hours of constant build up and orgasm with just seconds in between			2
' she has tried everything to cure her condition including ice , cold showers , changing her diet and increasing her exercise regime , but nothing works			1
the mother - of - one has learnt to control showing her arousal , but said it can really affect her mental well - being			2
' it makes me giggle because of the momentary high and outwardly i look okay but inwardly it 's a torture			0
dr @entity94 , an expert on sexual medicine at @entity96 in @entity97 said : ' persistent genital arousal disorder is a newly recognised condition , where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire			1
' pgad sufferers experience intrusive , unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting			1
this arousal can persist for hours , days or even longer			1
' this can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm , this often does n't help or can worsen the symptoms			2
' spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it 's those women who ca n't control the arousal which is uncommon			1
' i see around 20 women a year with this condition , it may be as common as one in 100 we just do n't know			2
' sometimes it may resolve on its own , there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient			0
' ' it is ruining my life , because it messes with your head			1
you body is running on a high , on an up and down , so it really affects your moods			0
' some days when it 's really bad i just want to shut the curtains and never get up			0
' other days i have little control over my body , and i will only have suffered 10 orgasms that day and i feel i could go back to work , get my life back			1
' on a good day life goes on , a bad day it 's disabling but i still have to pick up @entity24 from school , be a wife to @entity151 and make the dinner			1
' on a bad day it 's like the cookie monster on cookies			2
' she suffered with her condition for months before it became too unbearable to handle			1
after having an attack of 160 orgasms - not including multiple orgasms - in just two hours , mrs @entity3 sought the advice of her gp who was left baffled			1
later , medical experts would identify the incurable condition , which causes dehydration , injured knees and ankles and ultimately exhaustion from lack of sleep			2
she has been unable to wear high - heels since developing the condition as she never knows when she will suffer an attack			2
' you ca n't say to your future boss , ' i may not be able to come in today because i suffer from orgasms ' , he would think you were making it up , ' she said			0
' but it is n't just the embarrassment it 's needing a change of clothes , it 's that moment if you have a bad one and your knees give way and you hurt yourself			0
' you ca n't be a risk or a burden			0
' the condition has also put pressure on her marriage as she craves affection , intimacy and physical contact because of the number of hormones in her body			0
before her spontaneous orgasms started , she had only climaxed with her husband and the couple had sex around four times a month			0
' we still have sex but it can become incredibly frustrating for both of us because i am forever aroused , ' she said			0
the mother - of - one said her relationship with her husband @entity17 has become more strained			0
