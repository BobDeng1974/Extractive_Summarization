he was n’t quite collecting signatures for the campaign to ‘ get @entity8 to @entity9 ’ but nor was @entity3 of a mind to keep his bourgeoning respect for the player under a veil , either			1
the @entity11 midfielder , as @entity12 revealed earlier this month , has an admirer in the shape of @entity9 manager @entity15			1
recent personal checks by the @entity17 have confirmed a player blessed with pace , skill and bravery on the ball — everything he looks for in a midfielder , in fact			1
on sunday at @entity27 , @entity8 ’s credentials will be given another stern examination when @entity15 ’s side look to extend their winning sequence in the @entity31 to nine matches			1
@entity3 feels the full force of a @entity8 tackle during a meeting last season whatever transpires , the contribution of the 22 - year - old @entity38 could have significant ramifications for the transfer window which opens at the turn of the year			1
certainly , if @entity15 seeks a second opinion from his skipper on @entity8 ’s credentials before asking chief executive @entity45 to pick up the phone , it would be a brave man to bet against the @entity11 star swelling the @entity50 contingent at @entity51 in the near future			1
asked if he felt @entity8 was good enough to cut it at @entity9 , @entity3 replied : ‘ i do n’t see why not			1
i ’ve seen his attributes when he ’s been away with @entity50 , too , and what he does			1
‘ he understands that you ’ve got to show some respect but when he goes on the park he wants to win games as well			1
i love that about players			1
he works hard and wants to win games			1
you get disappointed if you do n’t			1
he ’s one of those lads			2
‘ it ’s not really up to me who we sign but there are some great @entity50 players out there			1
we signed @entity70 ( @entity71 ) and @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , while @entity74 ( @entity75 ) has come through the youths as well			2
we are bringing in @entity50 players as well			2
’ @entity8 is a player who can raise his game for the big occasion , and could cause @entity9 problems pressed to expand upon what in particular impressed him about the man he will face on sunday , @entity3 said : ‘ he works hard and always wants the ball			1
that ’s the main thing			2
especially in @entity50 , people can go hiding and do n’t want it and do n’t want to play in the big games			2
‘ he ’s a big - game player and he always seems to do really well against us			2
he ’s aggressive , strong and is direct as well			2
that ’s what i like about him			2
’ @entity3 ’s admiration stretches beyond just one individual at @entity27			1
almost two years since @entity96 and @entity97 left the @entity99 dugout for @entity100 , @entity11 fans have grown accustomed to a staple diet of entertaining , effective football			1
‘ @entity96 and @entity97 have got them playing really good football , ’ @entity3 added			1
‘ they get the ball down and try and play			2
‘ if you look around their squad they ’ve got some great players — some talented young ones as well			2
‘ @entity8 is a great player , ( @entity113 ) @entity112 and ( @entity115 ) @entity114 up front as well			1
they always create chances , but it ’s all about us on the day			2
if we turn up and play well , we should have too much for any team			2
’ @entity11 know to their cost that @entity3 is not merely mouthing off in that regard			1
back in august , they descended on @entity123 in optimistic mood but left humiliated after suffering a 6 - 1 drubbing			2
just weeks into @entity15 ’s regime , his @entity9 players left the field to thunderous applause at half - time			1
@entity15 is an admirer of the @entity11 midfielder , and could try and sign him in january welcome though such an ovation was , the manager — in his heart of hearts — could have lived without it			1
although he could n’t admit it at the time , deep down he knew such an inspiring display was something of a freak occurrence			2
‘ yeah , the worst thing of being a football manager is to let people down , ’ he said of the indifferent games that followed			2
‘ that ’s why it is so hard because you really want to make people happy			0
that ’s the same for the players			0
‘ i was n’t surprised that day			0
@entity11 attacked us and that opened up things for us			1
we also scored four goals from set - plays			0
i think if you go through goal chances we had eight and we scored six			0
so we were very effective			0
‘ the last four , five , six games we ’ve had 10 to 15 chances in every game			0
so if you see behind the result , i think we ’ve improved although we have n’t been so effective as we were in that @entity11 game			1
‘ in the transition we will go up and down			0
now we have gone through six months with some good games and some bad games , but i ’m very happy we are in all four tournaments now			0
we have gone through it in a good way and used the energy in the right way			0
’ @entity15 has had to learn quickly that quality time on the training ground with players is a luxury rarely afforded to @entity9 managers			1
@entity9 were superb as they thrashed @entity11 earlier in the season , and will hope for a repeat on sunday this week was the first since the campaign began that had n’t been interrupted by a midweek match or international football			1
for a new manager striving to do things his way , such constant interruptions have been a source of deep frustration			0
‘ we need more of this , ’ @entity15 stated			1
‘ it is hard to get the message across normally , so i have very much appreciated the opportunity this week			0
we ’ve had three very good days on the training pitch and that ’s been needed			0
‘ it is what the job is about for me			0
it ’s getting there , but everything is a bit slower than what it would be if we would be able to train the team three days in a row every week , like i ’m used to			0
‘ here you have to do it in different ways			0
you have to use more video , more one - to - one talks and team talks			0
‘ but you also ca n’t do too much of that because you can tire the players out mentally			0
i think everybody ’s understanding more where we want to go , how we want to play			0
i see so much potential			0
’ @entity3 ( left ) jokes with @entity220 in training , as @entity9 got a rare full week on the training pitches it can safely be assumed that once the festive programme is completed at @entity225 on january 5 , eight days at a winter training camp in @entity227 will be wisely spent			1
‘ it ’s evolution , not revolution , ’ @entity15 cautioned			1
‘ it ’s not like i ’m going to be able to show them in two training sessions everything in the world that i know and what i can do			0
‘ i believe you will ( see the team improve ) , but it ’s little by little			0
we ’ll go more and more together			0
we ’re working on the right things			0
there ’s a good attitude in the group , a good mood			0
‘ that makes it also so much better			0
’ after @entity27 , @entity9 entertain @entity247 next saturday before visits to @entity99 and @entity249 in the @entity250			1
for @entity15 , who has spent the last few years holidaying in @entity252 over @entity253 , it ’s a huge change			1
not that he ’d have it any other way , though			0
‘ every game is like @entity253 , ’ he said			0
my motivation is so high i just have to stagger myself so i do n’t want too much			0
i am always holding back because you need to take it step by step and save your energy throughout the long season			0

@entity15 may try and sign @entity8 in january
@entity3 has been impressed by @entity8 for club and country
