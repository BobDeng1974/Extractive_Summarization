by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 5 january 2013 a man has received nearly 300 phone calls after his number was broadcast on @entity5 's @entity4			1
the comedian @entity6 wrote down the number on the panel show , telling viewers it belonged to fellow panellist @entity11 , and urged the audience to ' call him whenever you want '			1
but the number belonged to @entity15 , a picture researcher , who has now received nearly 300 calls after the broadcaster allowed the number to be viewed			1
the number was shown on the @entity4 after @entity6 scrawled it down and claimed it belonged to @entity11 a row has been brewing after @entity6 and @entity21 made a raft of vulgar jokes @entity6 , 24 , had made up the combination , which had too many digits on it to be genuine , and @entity5 broadcast it - although they claim it was partially obscured and only shown briefly			1
but as the extra digits came at the end of mr @entity15 's number , it meant people automatically dialled him , despite them typing the full combination			1
mr @entity15 , 27 , from @entity33 , has complained to @entity34 and is now taking legal advice over what further steps he can take , the @entity32 reported			1
@entity6 was spotted today as the furore over the show grew @entity5 has apologised to mr @entity15 , who says he does not want to change his number as he had paid for one that was ' easy to remember '			1
but the broadcaster insisted viewers must have ' guessed ' the number because it was partially obscured on screen			2
the show had already resulted in more than 160 complaints to @entity34 and @entity5 because of offensive and vulgar jokes made about the @entity49 , the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
the programme was broadcast on december 30 and immediately afterwards mr @entity15 , who had not watched the show , began getting calls from people who hated @entity11 and wanted to shout abuse , or people who thought they were calling @entity6			1
mr @entity15 told the @entity32 : ' i did n’t even bother going to work on monday because i knew my phone would n’t stop ringing and i could n’t switch it off because a relative is ill and i needed to be contactable			1
' a @entity5 spokesman said : ' an illegible and non-functional number which contained more digits than a standard mobile number was shown very briefly on the contestant ’s panel on @entity4 , ' the newspaper reported			1
' whilst it was obscured and only shown briefly , some viewers have attempted to guess the number and this appears to have led to calls being made to this phone			2
' we have apologised and have further obscured the digits on repeats of the show			2
' @entity34 is ' assessing the complaints ' but is yet to launch an investigation , a spokesman said			1
halfway through the two - hour show @entity21 took a bottle of red wine and two glasses from beneath his desk and poured himself and @entity6 a drink , then started eating pizza			2
the pair were soon appeared to be drunk and @entity21 was slurring his words			0
he then started to make crude comments about @entity95 ’s @entity94 star @entity93 and @entity6 continued to drink more and host @entity96 later pointed out that the pair had drunk a bottle of wine each			0
afterwards @entity6 told his @entity101 followers : ' we got so drunk			0
' viewers took to @entity101 and television forums to vent their dismay even as the programme was being broadcast			2
the @entity4 of 2012 was far from unusual among programmes billed as ' light entertainment ' , in the way it revelled in lewd , humiliating jokes @entity6 comes from a privileged background			2
