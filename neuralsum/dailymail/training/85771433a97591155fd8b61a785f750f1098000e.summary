@entity0 asked his players to fly back and think of @entity2 as they returned to their clubs with homework assignments after monday ’s 2 - 0 win in @entity6			1
@entity0 and his coaching team are determined not to lose any positivity from that result before next month ’s @entity11 qualifiers against @entity12 and @entity13			2
@entity14 has been sent back to @entity15 with video clips of @entity17 and @entity18 , both experts in the midfield holding role he played for the first time in @entity23			1
tactical battle : @entity0 's decision to set his players up in a diamond formation proved to be a good one clear instructions : @entity0 has told his players to study certain players and the diamond formation pass master : @entity0 wants @entity14 to play in a similar role to what @entity17 does for @entity33 others have been encouraged to think about their specific roles in @entity2 ’s new formation and to stay in touch with @entity0 ’s coaching team , who know that some — like @entity14 and captain @entity41 — may fill different roles for their clubs			1
@entity14 said : ‘ we ’ve got to do our homework because we do n’t get long together			2
‘ i ’ll have to learn in that role but that formation is going to be the way forward and we ’ll only get better at it			0
’ after five winless games and a poor @entity51 , spirits have been lifted by two wins in six days — especially by the game in @entity23 , when @entity0 used a midfield diamond for the first time			2
the @entity2 boss now wants his squad to be more forceful with their opinions and has introduced players - only meetings where the new generation have their say			1
@entity41 said : ‘ players speak who would n’t ( if ) coaches are there			2
’ captain fantastic : @entity41 led his side to victory in his first competitive game as @entity2 skipper @entity73 @entity2 players stepped up - @entity0 second in command : @entity76 centre back @entity75 will wear the armband when @entity41 is unavailable @entity0 believes his forums will not only see players take responsibility off the field but encourage them to do so during a match			1
in @entity23 , @entity0 ’s three most experienced starters — @entity41 , @entity85 and @entity75 — all led by example			1
@entity76 centre half @entity75 was told he will be the captain if @entity41 is ever unavailable , with @entity85 third in command			1
@entity75 said : ‘ against @entity90 was the first time i ’d worn the armband			2
i know it was the last few minutes of a friendly but it still meant a hell of a lot to me			0
’ monday ’s success also strengthened @entity0 ’s hand as he hit out at @entity98 on tuesday			0
the @entity100 manager claimed players no longer want to play for @entity2 after the 1 - 0 win over @entity90 but @entity0 said : ‘ the thing about these players is they all have a burning desire to play for @entity2			1
that theory that players care more about their club sides is nonsense			0
they care about both — as they should			0
’ unfair criticism : @entity0 has hit out at @entity100 boss @entity98 for suggesting @entity2 players do not care about representing their country after beating the @entity6 — on paper their most difficult opponents — @entity2 are already looking at potential training camps in @entity118 , for the @entity120 finals			1
@entity0 is determined not to repeat the @entity51 blunder of having a hotel 90 minutes away from the training facilities			0
the @entity124 released a statement on thursday after @entity2 fans in @entity23 chanted ‘ * * * * off @entity127 , we ’re all voting yes ’ in reference to next week ’s referendum			0
@entity2 play @entity127 in a friendly at @entity131 in november and the @entity124 are keen to distance themselves from political issues			0
@entity133 , managing director of @entity2 , said : ‘ we are working closely with the @entity124 and taking all usual security precautions			0
we were pleased that the @entity136 fixture in 2013 passed peacefully with over 20,000 @entity127 fans adding to the atmosphere of respectful rivalry			0

@entity14 has been told to watch video clips of @entity17
