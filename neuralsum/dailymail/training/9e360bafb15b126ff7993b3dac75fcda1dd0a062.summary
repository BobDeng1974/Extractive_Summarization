it is the end product of the most expensive weapons programme in @entity3 history , set back by glitches and overspending , but today marked the first time an @entity8 fighter landed on a carrier ship			1
this video shows the @entity12 stealth fighter , which has cost the government nearly $ 400billion so far , touching down on the deck of the @entity15 off the coast of @entity17			1
the operation is being hailed by the @entity19 as a major step forward in the race to get the aircraft operational , after the entire @entity3 fleet was grounded earlier this year following an engine fire			2
there are three variants - the standard @entity45 , designed for conventional takeoff , the @entity56 for short take off and vertical landing , and the @entity8 which is designed for use on carriers			1
aircrew : one @entity63 : @entity64 ( 1,217.3mph ) length : 51ft @entity66 : 35ft @entity68 altitude : 50,000ft today marks the first time an f - 35c has been landed on a carrier using the tail - hook system , where a large metal hook hanging from the back of the aircraft snags on a cable laid across the deck of the carrier , slowing it down very quickly			1
@entity79 , spokesman for the @entity19 's f - 35 joint program office , said the landing was part of a two - week sea - based test that runs until november 17			0
the sea testing of the plane will give officials key data about the ship 's performance on a carrier , and allow any adjustments needed to keep the program on track for initial use by the fleet in 2018			2
the latest exercises are part of an extensive array of sea tests as the aircraft enters the final phase of its development ahead of an expected 2018 deployment in video footage the plane can be seen using a tail - hook to land - grappling on to a wire laid across the deck the @entity45 has three variants - the @entity45 , designed for conventional runway takeoff , the @entity56 , designed for short landing and vertical takeoff , and the @entity8 , designed for use on aircraft carriers @entity117 test pilot commander @entity116 , who landed the cf - 03 aircraft on the @entity15 flight deck just after noon , called it a ' landmark event			1
' vice admiral @entity122 , commander of @entity123 , said the landing was ' historic , ' noting that it begins ' the integration of the next generation of warfighting capability into our carrier - based wings			2
' the jet , and a second due to arrive later monday or tuesday , will carry out two weeks of testing at sea , the first of three testing phases planned for the carrier variant of the @entity45			2
the jets will perform operational manoeuvres , including various catapult takeoffs and arrested landings using a tailhook that had be redesigned after early test problems on land			0
the @entity45 and its two variants will form the backbone of the @entity3 airforce , while @entity50 partners such as the @entity51 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity52 also expected to buy the aircraft the fighter is designed to be invisible to radar and can travel at up to @entity150 , more than one and a half times the speed of sound the entire fleet of @entity3 planes had to be grounded earlier this year following the discovery of a cracked rotor blade in one of the engines , and an engine fire air force lieutenant general @entity160 , who runs the program for the @entity19 , said the @entity117 , @entity19 and contractors had been preparing for the testing for months			1
the high - tech fighter allows the pilot to fly at up to 1.6 times the speed of sound while being completely invisible to radar			0
the fighter 's helmet contains a display which maps the battlefield below and will even map underneath the plane - allowing the pilot to effectively see through the floor			0
graphics projected directly onto the visor inside the helmet give a 360 - degree view , with icons representing threats and friendly forces for miles around the aircraft			0
two touchscreens display all of the pilot 's information , and allow him to immediately share data with commanders at sea , in the air or on the ground			0
the jet , and a second due to arrive later monday or tuesday , will carry out two weeks of testing at sea , the first of three testing phases			0

@entity45 fighter cost $ 400billion to develop and was hit by *delays*
today marked first time @entity8 variant landed *successfully* on aircraft carrier
exercise hailed as ' landmark ' moment ahead of expected 2018 deployment
