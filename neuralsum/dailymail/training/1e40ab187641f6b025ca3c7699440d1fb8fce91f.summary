the thousands of comments posted on the websites included : @entity214 : ‘ ten years ’ imprisonment for killing a member of the @entity101 , yet killing @entity217 in his bedroom was fine			2
he is still a human being , what ’s the difference ? of course , silly old me , forgot the governments of this world can do what they please ! ’ oilywater@rumandcoffee : ‘ @entity226 goes down for life , 10 years min. that ’s going to inflict more damage to the @entity5 than the @entity101 ever could			1
’ @entity238 : ‘ it ’s a war ! who could blame him for shooting that guy after witnessing his comrades ’ legs hanging in the trees			2

should have been given a medal			0
talk about lions led by donkeys ! ’ @entity272 : ‘ locking him up is a disgrace			2

‘ if you put these people next to each other , the moral gap is huge			0
he has been given a longer sentence than some rapists and child molesters			0
