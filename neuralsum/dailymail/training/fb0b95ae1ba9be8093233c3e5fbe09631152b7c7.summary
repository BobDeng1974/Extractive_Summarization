by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 felt @entity2 were unlucky to leave the @entity3 without a win after showing themselves as a ' good team ' against @entity7			1
the @entity2 ' underwhelming campaign came to an end as they played out a goalless draw with the surprise group winners in a dead rubber in @entity13			1
@entity1 told @entity14 : ' we showed today what a good team we can be			1
' apart from the first 10 or 12 minutes of the game i thought we dominated it totally			0
' unfortunately we did n't take our goal chances today			1
had we taken them it would have been a comfortable victory			0
' content : the @entity2 manager was pleased that his side had given the fans something to smile about reserves : @entity1 joins @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 to greet fans @entity46 missed three good chances for @entity2 and was unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty in the first half after a clash with @entity51			1
@entity1 said : ' we created the chances , that is important , and normally @entity46 is so clinical			1
' i am not that concerned			0
i know he will take the goal chances in the future			2
the important thing is to keep giving him the opportunity			0
' but i have got to say i think we are really unlucky not to win this game			0
' i am pleased at least to have given the fans something to cheer about it terms of our performance			2
' wide of the mark : @entity46 had three good chances but failed to add to his sole @entity3 goal against @entity73 good luck : @entity1 hugs @entity7 coach @entity75 as the opposition secured top spot in @entity78 the result meant @entity7 finished top of @entity78 with seven points while @entity2 , already eliminated after defeats to @entity73 and @entity83 , ended bottom with one			1
with his side 's exit already confirmed before the game , @entity1 made nine changes to his starting line - up to give other squad members an opportunity			1
he said : ' i thought they all did very well and i thought the whole back four was absolutely excellent			0
' we restricted a team that has beaten @entity73 and @entity83 and topped the group , we restricted them to almost no chances			2
' @entity100 was very good behind and in midfield i thought we dominated it , we outplayed them in that area			2
' the only thing we did n't do is take them and that 's a great disappointment			1
' new era : @entity109 was one of those making his @entity3 bow as @entity1 made big changes veteran midfielder @entity22 , who captained the side , also felt @entity2 should have won the match			1
the 36 - year - old said : ' it was a difficult game to approach			0
' i think we did everything we could do			0
we showed a bit of character , we prepared right for the last two days			0
everyone knows how tough it 's been			0
' it was n't vintage but we had enough chances to win the game			2
i think we played some good stuff , bright stuff at times , and created enough chances to win			2
' @entity22 's future as an @entity2 player beyond the tournament has been the subject of speculation			1
agreement : @entity1 and @entity22 both felt @entity2 should have come out on top against the group winners he was asked about the issue but said he had not yet made a decision on whether he would retire from international football			1
he said : ' i do n't know			0
i really enjoyed being involved and i love playing for my country , that 's obvious			0
i am 36 and still doing it			0
if i feel i can offer something i will do but at the moment it is too soon to say			0
' @entity148 : @entity22 replaced @entity41 in midfield in what could be his final @entity2 appearance still standing : @entity153 chairman @entity152 has said that @entity1 will manage @entity2 at @entity154 despite a poor showing in @entity156			1
