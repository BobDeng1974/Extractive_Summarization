by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 18:50 est , 25 july 2012 in two of the three tests , the birds ¿ @entity5 jays ¿ did just as well as the seven - year - old children it ’s a suggestion that will give pause for thought to even the proudest of parents			1
for no matter how bright they believe their son or daughter is , until the age of seven , children are , at least in some respects , no brainier than birds			1
in simple experiments , birds did just as well as children up until the age of seven			1
researchers pitted birds against boys and girls using tests inspired by the @entity27 ’s fable in which a thirsty crow is able to drink from a pitcher after using pebbles to raise the water level to within its reach			1
in two of the three tests at @entity35 , the birds – eurasian jays – did just as well as the seven - year - old children			1
after this , the human mind proved superior to the bird brain			0
the experiments built on earlier work in which jays quickly learned that adding stones to a cylinder half - filled with water would bring a tasty treat floating on the surface within reach of their beaks			1
in a second task the jays – colourful members of the crow family and about the same size as jackdaws – realised it was better to use pebbles , which sink , than corks , which float			1
when @entity62 children , aged four to ten , were set similar tasks , they did as well as the jays on the first , up to the age of seven			2
brainy boy ? up until the age of seven , children are , at least in some respects , be no brainier than birds from the age of eight , the pupils learned more quickly than the birds			2
the pattern was similar with the second task – except four - year - old children did worse than the jays			1
however , a third , more complex , task separated the youngsters from the birds			2
it again involved dropping objects into water to raise its level			0
but this time , a u-shaped tube was used , with the join at its bottom hidden , giving the impression it was two separate tubes			0
it meant dropping a stone into one ‘ tube ’ led to the water rising in the ‘ other ’ – a counter-intuitive result			0
this appeared to confuse the birds			2
however , the children did as well as before , the journal @entity97 reports			0
the researchers said this shows children are better at putting preconceptions aside			0
@entity102 , a phd student , said : ‘ it is a child ’s job to learn about the world			0
they ca n’t do that if they ’re limited by a preconceived idea about what is or is not possible			0
‘ for a child , if it works , it works			0
the birds , however , found it much harder to learn what was happening because they were put off by the fact it should n’t be happening			2

@entity5 jays *outperform* 7 - year - olds in logic tests
birds do better than humans in two out of three tests
