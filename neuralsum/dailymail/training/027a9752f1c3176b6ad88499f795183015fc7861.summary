by @entity0 published : 09:09 est , 12 october 2012 updated : 09:09 est , 12 october 2012 it 's a big , bad world out there			2
but for one tiny turtle it clearly proved to be a little too frightening for exploration just yet			2
the nervous creature hatched from its egg but then stayed there for two more days , peering at the outside world before finally emerging			1
the @entity8 , which is native to south east @entity9 , is endangered due to over collection in the wild for food and the pet trade			1
nervous : the little turtle peers out from the tiny hole in its egg ... and then stays there for two more days finding its feet : the tiny turtle finally emerges from the comfort of its temporary home the little creature was hatched at the @entity24 in @entity25 , which houses 75 different species of turtle			1
the @entity8 has a very brittle shell and it is not uncommon for the parents to crush them by accident			1
this one broke a hole in its shell after a 126 - day incubation period but then stayed in there for another two days			1
senior herpetologist at the aquarium @entity40 said : ' unlike other endangered turtles reared at the aquarium this year , this recent addition was rather slow to venture into the world			0
' @entity45 just come right out , but this turtle seemed content to open one end of the egg and look out at the world from inside the shell			1
this baby turtle hatched after an incubation period lasting 126 days			2
' it stayed there for two days before emerging			0
' it is the first time that the aquarium has successfully hatched a @entity8 and it is one of only about 20 in accredited zoos and aquariums in the entire @entity25			1
rare : the @entity8 , native to south east @entity9 , is endangered due to over collection in the wild for food and the pet trade @entity66 get their common names from the three raised ridges , or ' keels ' running the length of their shells			1
the edge of the shell has a number of sharp spikes near the tail			0
they are mainly carnivorous and terrestrial , living near water rather than in it and adults grow up to seven inches long			0
the species is native to @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
like many other @entity90 , keeled box turtles have been over-collected in the wild for food , medicine and the pet trade			0
several conservation organisations are working to protect the remaining wild populations from illegal trade , while zoos and aquariums are working toward increasing assurance populations in human care			0
this assures that the species does not go extinct if these animals disappear in the wild			0
the @entity24 has one of the largest turtle collections on public display with more than 500 individuals representing 75 species			2
the @entity24 now has six @entity66			2
there are three adults , one male and two females , this new baby and a pair of young @entity116 .			0
