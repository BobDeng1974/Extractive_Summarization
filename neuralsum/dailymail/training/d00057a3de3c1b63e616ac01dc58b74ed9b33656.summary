yesterday , a spokesman for @entity38 app @entity36 , who carried out the research , said : ' we 're flooded with images of people that conform to traditional " @entity47 " notions of beauty , but it is n't always about looks			2
' the results show many brits have a secret celebrity crush that they would be less keen to voice or feel others would n't agree with them about			1
' that shows that there 's more to attraction and it seems a strong personality or authority plays a part , with @entity30 and @entity24 proving popular			0
' the @entity36 app works using a complex algorithm through a computer program that performs high - performance face identification and facial feature recognition			0

' unfortunately for most of us , we ca n't emulate the standard of beauty shown to us in the media , but the celebrities on this list are a lot more down to earth in their appearance , and that 's reflected by the number of @entity36 matches people like @entity30 have			0
