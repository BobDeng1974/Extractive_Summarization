by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:31 est , 2 february 2014 one in five lung transplant patients are given organs from 20 - a - day smokers , research has revealed			1
overall , almost a half of donated lungs come from someone who had smoked , according to a major @entity11 study			0
using lung transplants from smokers is a way of boosting supply as there is a constant shortage of donor organs			1
discovery : transplant patients who are given smokers ' lungs ( right ) are just as likely to survive as those who receive organs from non-smokers ( left ) , a study has revealed			1
some patients even had higher survival rates but for one in five patients , their donors had smoked a packet a day or more for at least 20 years			1
despite this , the researchers said patients ' survival rate was not harmed by receiving a smoker 's lung and the research should ease patients ' fears about donors who had smoked			2
the study showed that patients who received lungs from non-smokers actually had a slightly lower one - year survival rate			1
the research was carried out at @entity47 in north - west @entity48			2
it analysed the difference in short and medium - term survival rates between patients given lungs from both smokers and non-smokers			1
since 2007 , 237 lung transplants have been carried out and 90 per cent of them were double - lung transplants			1
in total , 53 per cent were given lungs from non-smokers , while 29 per cent got lungs from donors who smoked for less than 20 years and 18 per cent were given the lungs of people who smoked 20 or more a day for at least 20 years			0
concern : the use of smokers ' lungs in transplants has sparked controversy - largely because of its perceived risk to patients ( file picture ) @entity76 : one - year and three - year survival rates were about the same for all three groups			1
non-smokers performed relatively poorly in the short term with 77.7 per cent of transplant patients surviving one year compared to 90.8 per cent with smokers ' lungs			2
there was no significant difference in the overall effectiveness of the lungs , time spent in intensive care and in hospital			0
@entity89 , director of heart and lung transplantation and consultant cardiac surgeon at @entity94 and @entity95 , said : ' donor lungs from even heavy smokers may provide a valuable avenue for increasing donor organ availability			1
' he said the results showed that even donors with a heavy smoking history ' may provide a much - needed lease on life to the critically ill patient whose chances of survival diminish with every day or week that passes by on the waiting list '			0
he added : ' i believe that candidates significantly decrease their chances of survival if they choose to decline organs from smokers			0
' mr @entity89 said that although it may ' seem strange ' that smokers ' lungs perform just as well , he stressed that all organs are assessed before operations go ahead to ensure ' maximum quality and safety '			0
@entity11 @entity123 data shows that only 20 per cent of patients get transplants within six months			0
the figure rises to 51 per cent after three years , but by that time nearly one in three patients has died waiting for a transplant			0
lung transplants are carried out for patients with a range of serious ailments including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis			2
the results of the study were reported in the @entity138			0
research site : the study was conducted at @entity47 ( pictured ) in @entity141 , north west @entity48			0

patients given smokers ' lungs are just as likely to survive , says new study
237 lung transplants carried out at @entity47 over six - year period
out of these , 47 per cent of patients received organs from heavy smokers
meanwhile , 53 per cent were given lungs from non-smoking donors
however , survival rates were similar over one - year and three - year *periods*
