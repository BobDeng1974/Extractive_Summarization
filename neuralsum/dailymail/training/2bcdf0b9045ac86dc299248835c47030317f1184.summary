if remembering your four digit pin is confusing , things are about to get a lot worse			0
researchers have unveiled a new , safer system using colours and symbols as well as numbers			1
they say it could cut atm fraud dramatically			0
the keypad of the future ? the colours and symbols move around each time the pad is used , and are displayed on its screen a user chooses a pin with a combination of numbers , colours and shapes / symbols : for example - 3 , square , pink , flag			1
each time that the user has to input their pin , the colours and symbols randomly change position on the keypad , so you ’re never pressing the same sequence of keys			1
called @entity35 , the idea came to inventor @entity36 after a friend was a victim of @entity40 fraud			2
' @entity41 is a very simple , but effective idea with a higher level of security than traditional @entity44 , ' he said			0
the system would avoid many current practices used by fraudster to steal @entity44 numbers , such as ' shoulder surfing ' to see which keys are being pressed			2
because different keys would be pressed every time a withdrawl was made , it would be impossible to find a pin without seeing the screen and keypad clearly			2
' it looks like much like any other 10 digit keypad , but instead of each button having just a number , they also have a colour and a symbol / shape , ' the firm says			1

it could also be used to unlock smartphones , tablets and even doors , the firm says			0
' the great thing about @entity90 is that it 's a software solution , so if it was available on @entity93 / @entity92 , all you need to do is update current devices rather than upgrade or change them , ' said @entity36			0
the first company to use tri-pin is @entity97 on there @entity99 app on @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 the system could be used on existing atm machines by updating their software			0
