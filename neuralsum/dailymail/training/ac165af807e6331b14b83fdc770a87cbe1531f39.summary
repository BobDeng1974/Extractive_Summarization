by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 14:06 est , 2 april 2013 when i heard mums get asked more questions per hour than @entity4 faces at @entity6 's questions , i was n't surprised			2
girls aged four are the most persistent interrogators , demanding an astonishing 390 answers every day			2
mums have taken to searching the internet for help with explaining why the sky is blue and water is wet			2
i sympathise - i was an irritatingly curious child , but the trouble is i 've never got out of the habit			1
every day dozens of questions about modern life bubble up through my consciousness , demanding answers			2
@entity0 would like to know if @entity19 would be so funny with neat hair , and why @entity21 has been given a column about food when she clearly does n't eat all that much sadly , i never receive any			1
and , judging by my postbag , you feel the same			2
what we need instead of a radio show called @entity29 - hosted by @entity30 , on which politicians never give any answers , just a load of the same old waffling rubbish - is a show called @entity36			1
i would gladly be the host , because it 's bound to be a smash hit			2
here are some of the recurring @entity40 that clog up my brain day in and day out , and which no politician or expert has been able to answer : 1			2
why does @entity21 write about feasts in a food magazine when she obviously does n't eat much ? 2			1
sorry , another @entity21 question , but she is a modern enigma			1
why does she outline her eyes with that black stuff - is it to make sure we know that those two little white things with pupils in them next to her nose are eyes , not ears ? ( that 's how i feel about lip - liner , too			1
how does @entity61 ' feel our pain ' ? he has n't given birth , stayed at home to breastfeed his babies or given up his career to be a house husband			1
we know he can cry ( ok , snivel ) and look sad , and is probably henpecked			2
but is he a vertebrate that has pain sensors ? 4			2
does @entity70 have more than two expressions : cross and even crosser ? does he put stuff in his eyes so they look very white on telly ? 5			1
does @entity19 ever comb his hair or is it part of his brand ? if he combed it , would his brain work differently and be less ' fun ' ? 6			2
is anyone going to take the blame for failures in the @entity87 ? how many deaths in an @entity87 hospital does it take for one executive to hand in their notice ? does ten grannies , a couple of babies , half a dozen mums and five old men wasting away from preventable bugs and infection add up to enough human misery for one highly paid @entity87 executive to give up their pension ? 7			2
if we spend so much time moaning about kids leaving school illiterate , why do n't we spend more money on teachers and reduce class sizes ? 8			0
the complexities of modern language			0
what does the word ' luxury ' mean when written on a @entity116 emery board ? likewise , the words ' limited edition ' splashed across a @entity120 bag of rocket salad ? @entity122 once meant something we could n't afford			0
limited edition meant an artwork			0
now they mean dog biscuits and panty liners - help , guidance needed ! 9			1
are benefits being reduced or not ? according to one minister , @entity133 , claimants will see benefits rise year on year			0
according to @entity135 , @entity136 , the bill will be cut			0
is this mysterious thing called a @entity138 a bit like my pension schemes : a bit of paper that arrives once a year and is completely incomprehensible ? 10			0
i did n't get the @entity144 in a financial mess			0
we did n't speculate on currencies , futures , derivatives , dodgy mortgages or commodities			0
i pay all my tax in the @entity144 every year - and so do most of you			1
so why are we asked to tighten our belts , accept lower wages , work fewer hours , pay higher taxes and cough up more to eat , travel and heat our homes ? in short , why am i sending a bigger proportion of what i earn back to @entity163 to pay off some debt i did n't cause in the first place ? just thought i 'd ask ! stones stuck in the mud @entity168 and @entity169 the @entity170 play @entity171 - a month before @entity169 turns 70			1
as a youthful pensioner , i should be celebrating , but i find it deeply depressing			0
the @entity170 are smug and unthreatening , a showband charging ludicrous prices for old hits			1
punk and protest and confrontation in pop have been replaced by bland cosiness , like the other headline act at @entity183			0
as a teenager i watched the @entity170 rehearse in @entity185 and noted every appearance in my diary			1
they represented everything the establishment found threatening - sex with anyone you fancied , drugs and radical politics			1
the @entity170 got stuck in a rut - they rarely collaborate with young musicians to re-invent themselves			1
i would n't wear a frock from 1963 , so why listen to this old stuff ? @entity200 is n't a crime l plates young people in @entity204 can no longer go out at night without being accompanied by an adult			1
to fight antisocial behaviour , a curfew has been imposed on under - 16s between 9pm and 6am in parts of the town			1
a good idea on one level , but it smacks of desperation			0
the sight of coppers frog - marching home any teenager who dares to pop out for a beer with their mates fills me with gloom			1
loafing about at night is what teenagers have always done			0
i spent hours mincing past my chip shop in the hope of attracting one spotty youth			0
surely police efforts should be focused on known troublemakers , ensuring that young people have places such as under - used church halls to go to and let off steam ? in another worrying development , the government is considering imposing a curfew on young drivers , too , and extending the time during which their licence can be revoked if they incur more than six penalty points			1
motoring organisations want newly qualified drivers banned from the road between 11pm and 4am , to be allowed only one passenger under 20 and to lose their licence if they ’ve consumed alcohol			0
these measures might sound good in theory , but what is needed is better education for drivers and more access to motor workshops and apprenticeships for car - crazy boys and girls			1
at this rate , we might as well lock up all under - 16s each night so they ca n’t smoke , drink , swear , drive or breathe anywhere we do n’t approve of			1
only joking ! @entity260 it up @entity261 sewing is one of the most restful hobbies			0
as a teenager , i made all my own clothes , re-cutting patterns to make skinny shift dresses , tight @entity271 shorts and shirts with curvy collars			0
as an architecture student , i designed and stitched silver coats and skirts for a trendy shop in @entity278 , so i was never exactly a poor student , though my college work probably suffered as a result			0
i was thrilled to find a new @entity282 series about dressmaking starts tomorrow at 8pm - until i read the host is that female faucet of mindless gush , stick insect fashionista @entity261			1
she probably irons her hair , not her paper patterns , and knows as much about sewing as @entity290 does about baking			0
the @entity282 says looks do n't matter when they choose their female presenters			0
you ca n't pull the darning wool over my eyes			0
pass the bucket , @entity298 @entity299 i could n't face watching the @entity282 's imagine on @entity299			0
the singer wrote it , directed it , starred in it and it was all about her favourite subject - herself			1
@entity299 wore a leather corset reminiscent of a hi - tech cheese cutter to perform at the @entity307			1
she says she 's a feminist and is headlining a charity concert in @entity309 on june 1 to promote women 's rights , produced by the team responsible for @entity312 and sponsored by @entity313			0
the superstar just happens to be touring @entity315 with her mrs @entity317 tour - referring to her married name			2
she says : ' i need to find a new word for feminism ... like bootylicious			0
' that sounds about as empowering as her crotch - hugging leather knickers			2
i feel a bit queasy .			0
