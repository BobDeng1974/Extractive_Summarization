the terror warlord who has declared himself leader of the @entity3 world , but was criticsed for wearing an expensive - looking wristwatch , may have instead been wearing a more modest item designed to predict prayer times			1
@entity7 , the leader of the @entity8 - known formerly as @entity9 - recently declared himself leader of a @entity3 caliphate and launched a scathing attack on the @entity13			1
but his fearsome address - in which he demanded loyalty from the world 's 1.2billion @entity16 and hailed ' long years of jihad ' - was undermined by his outfit			1
fit for a caliph : jihadists online claim that , rather than a @entity28 , @entity38 was wearing the @entity41 , pictured above viewers of his video quickly latched on to the incongruous piece of jewellery , suggesting that it could be a @entity28 , @entity48 or a £ 3,500 @entity49 of the western world he despises			1
but today @entity52 supporters of the caliph hit back , saying that his watch is in fact a @entity57 - @entity41 watch , which can predict calls to prayer worldwide , according to the @entity60			1
it has not been confirmed whether the watch is the exact model he wears , but if it were it would offer @entity65 features including a compass pointing to @entity67 and the option to set the date by the gregorian calendar or a @entity3 equivalent			1
social media posts from on user explained : ' @entity41 watches are really good - it beebs when it 's @entity76 ( prayer ) time			2
alhamdulilah ! the @entity78 has good taste			0
' another added : ' i want this ! ! ! n i want his black turban too			0
! ' the public appearance - a rarity for the leader dubbed ' the invisible @entity78 ' - seemed to be an attempt to mimic @entity3 leaders of 1,000 years ago , when @entity3 empires ruled huge , unified tracts of the world			1
described as the world ’s most wanted man , militants operating under @entity95 ’s control have spread terror through @entity99 and @entity100 in an attempt to form a new @entity3 state in the @entity103			2
the @entity105 fighters , responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands , have vowed to expand the so - called caliphate to huge swathes of @entity109 and @entity110			2
watch me : the self - anointed ' @entity111 ' conducted a 20 - minute sermon wearing the watch this week alternative : despite the criticism some have claimed it is in fact a pious @entity3 model video footage of @entity95 , who has garnered the nickname ‘ the invisible sheikh ’ due to his elusive nature , emerged online on friday and was quickly spread by jihadi websites			1
fighters from the group – previously known as @entity9 - were among those who joined a packed congregation at the @entity129 in @entity35 , @entity100 ’s second largest city , as he delivered the 21 - minute speech			0
referring to himself as ‘ the leader who presides over you ’ , @entity7 said that he could return the @entity3 world to ‘ dignity , might , rights and leadership			1
’ he said : ‘ i am the wali ( leader ) who presides over you , though i am not the best of you , so if you see that i am right , assist me			0
’ ‘ i am not better than you or more virtuous than you , ’ he added			0
people were quick to spot the watch being worn by @entity38 as he conducted the 20 - minute sermon another asked on @entity147 what make watch the @entity111 was wearing during the video he also used the sermon to praise his army of fighters , who have taken control of @entity35 only one month before , and called for the strict interpretation of islamic law			2
‘ @entity156 gave your mujahedeen brothers victory after long years of jihad and patience ... so they declared the caliphate and placed the caliph in charge , ’ he said			2
‘ this is a duty on muslims that has been lost for centuries			0
’ the supposition that the wristwatch was an expensive @entity30 model was particularly embarrassing given that it seemed to contradict the content of his speech			1
the @entity175 in particular has been styled a ' @entity177 ' watch in honour of the long - standing association of the spy films with the model			2
when @entity182 took over the role of @entity177 in 1995 he wore the @entity184 in the movie @entity185			0
in all later films , @entity182 wore an @entity188			0
@entity189 , who starred in @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 , also wears the @entity175			0
the watch was formerly believed to be either a @entity28 , @entity48 or £ 4,000 @entity175 ( pictured ) fit for a spy : actor @entity182 as @entity177 wearing the @entity175 watch only two images of @entity95 – who was the leader of @entity9 - are thought to have existed before his appearance in the video			1
reports have claimed that the terror chief even insists on talking to his deputies wearing a mask in an effort to protect his identity			0
@entity100 officials last night said they were still working to authenticate the video but it is understood initial investigations have concluded the preacher is @entity95			0
the @entity210 offered £ 5.8million for information leading to his capture or death in 2011 the group is thought to be made up of 11,000 fighters in @entity100 and @entity99 and 3,000 foreign jihadis , including 500 @entity218 .			0

@entity7 , the leader of the @entity8 , declared himself caliph
he demanded loyalty from the world 's @entity224 in video address
but was mocked for wearing expensive - looking wristwatch
some speculated it was an @entity30 model worth as much as £ 3,500
however , @entity52 *defenders* of the caliph said it was a £ *260* @entity3 watch
the *device* - by maker @entity239 - predicts prayer times and points to @entity67
