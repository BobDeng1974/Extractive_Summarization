officials say he created false provenances for the antiquities			2
the discovery was made after a visitor last year recognized the name of @entity17 's @entity18 gallery as the source of a 2,000 - year - old terra cotta rattle and contacted authorities , said @entity49 , the museum 's director			1
museum officials then pored over their records and determined six other @entity4 items had ties to @entity17			1
he said @entity17 donated one of the items and sold five to the museum , while one was a gift from someone else			1
agents are hailing the @entity63 museum for being the first @entity16 institution to publicly and easily cooperate with the investigation , dubbed ' @entity66 , ' involving four arrests and the recovery of thousands of pieces worth a total of $ 150 million			1
' owning stolen stuff is not part of our mission , ' mr @entity49 said			0
' i 'm not sure we 've done anything heroic			0
we just want to do the right thing			0
' mr @entity49 watched as agents inspected the items - the rattle , figurines , architectural fragments and tiles - and them hauled them in packed crates into a truck			1
the items were found to have been sourced from @entity17 ( pictured ) , who is facing charges in @entity4 @entity88 , a special agent for @entity89 , inspects the artifacts in the basement of the @entity6 this tile is believed to have been looted from a religious temple or ancient @entity3 site in @entity4 they have now been packed up and sent to @entity18 , from where they will be returned to @entity4 's government @entity99 stressed there was no culpability on the museum 's part , as it was n't aware of the items ' provenance when it acquired them between 1991 and 2003			1
mr @entity49 said @entity16 art museums are becoming more rigorous in vetting the history of objects they acquire			2
' could we have done a better job ? sure , ' he said			0
' were we a victim ? yes			0
' homeland security investigations special agent @entity88 said it was not uncommon for unsavory dealers to donate ill - gotten items for tax benefits and other reasons			2
mr @entity88 is part of a group of agents in @entity18 that focus on cultural property crime whose work includes dismantling the organizations behind the crimes and repatriating the seized pieces			2
some institutions are reluctant to come forward , partly because of the financial loss involved , he said			0
it 's very rare for evidence to come to light to show a museum has items that were illegally obtained , said @entity134 , president and ceo of the @entity136			2
an item looted from @entity4 is wrapped up in packaging before being sent back to @entity4 the stunning antiquities were sourced from art dealer @entity17 , who is facing charges in @entity4 ' claims might come from time to time			1
but most often those claims are based on just interest or the construction of national identity , ' he said			0
' if evidence is provided that 's convincing , no museum will resist			0
' he cited an example from about 10 years ago when @entity153 police uncovered evidence revealing a number of items that were improperly removed from @entity153			0
the @entity16 museums where some of the items ended up returned them , he said			0
repatriation has become more common in the past couple of decades , said @entity162 , a professor of @entity164 and @entity165 art and archaeology at the @entity167			0
as a general rule of thumb , museums and art collectors avoid purchasing items exported without clear and valid documentation before 1970 - the year of a @entity174 cultural agreement targeting trafficking in antiquities , he said			2
' transparency is important , and if the @entity63 museum has been open , that 's probably to be applauded , ' @entity162 said			0
