@entity0 from @entity1 in @entity2 was the first person to have a womb transplant			1
she is looking forward to having @entity4 @entity6 ’s first womb transplant could be carried out in just two years			1
surgeons in @entity8 are on the verge of perfecting the procedure that will allow childless women to carry their own babies			1
@entity13 , who plans to carry out the pioneering op , says it could provide a ‘ ray of light ’ for the 15,000 young @entity6 women of childbearing age who were born without a womb or had it removed due to illness			1
however , critics question whether giving a woman the chance to experience the joy of pregnancy is worth ‘ experimenting ’ on an unborn child			1
mr @entity13 , a consultant gynaecological surgeon at the @entity28 in west @entity8 , has spent almost 15 years researching the subject and today launches the charity @entity30 to raise the £ 500,000 needed for the first five ops			1
a womb has only been transplanted successfully once before , in @entity33 last august			1
but the recipient has not yet become pregnant			1
@entity0 , who is due to start @entity4 in september in the hope of conceiving a much longed - for child , recently told the @entity37 : ‘ if i had a magic wand , i would want to be pregnant now			1
i just want to hold my baby in my arms , to be a mother			1
’ mr @entity13 , of charity @entity30 , is using a similar technique to the @entity33 surgeons but says his work has been delayed by lack of funding			1
he has already ploughed significant amounts of his own money into the quest and hopes the appeal will attract donations from medical charities and members of the public			1
he has already done successful womb transplants in rabbits and one became pregnant , although it later miscarried			2
more work on rabbits and then on sheep is planned			2
if successful , the operation could be carried out on a @entity6 woman in as little as two years			2
danger : fertility expert @entity65 says the risks are not worth taking			2
surrogacy is an alternative option mr @entity13 has already been approached by more than 50 women			1
the candidate for surgery would be between 20 and 40 and born without a womb or had it removed due to illness			2
the woman would have ovaries and so be able to produce eggs , will be given a womb from a dead donor in a four - hour operation			2
powerful immunosuppressant drugs will prevent the new womb from being rejected and six months to a year later , the woman will be given @entity4 to become pregnant			2
any baby will have to delivered by caesarean section because the new tissue will not stand up to a natural birth			2
the woman is likely to be at extra risk of a host of complications of pregnancy , as well as miscarrying or having a premature birth			0
the process does not end there			0
long - term risks of disease and side effects from the anti-rejection drugs mean the new womb will need to be taken out again after one or two pregnancies			0
currently , such women have their options limited to remaining childless , adoption or surrogacy			0
@entity104 , who had a hysterectomy due to cancer said she would have had a womb transplant ' in a second ' if it had been available @entity104 had a hysterectomy within months of being married - and would have had a womb transplant in a second			0
mrs @entity104 was just 32 when she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer of the womb and had the lifesaving hysterectomy			0
she said : ‘ i had just been married for six months , i ’d always wanted children and i was absolutely devastated			0
’ after deciding against adoption because of the length of time it would take , the @entity118 settled on surrogacy			0
they now have two boys , aged four and five , who are genetically their own and were carried by the same surrogate mother			0
mrs @entity104 , who is now 40 and lives in @entity8 where she is setting up a business , says that she has no regrets about the route she chose – but would have opted for a womb transplant had it been available			0
she said : ‘ @entity132 was the most fantastic experience but i would have had a womb transplant in a second			0
‘ i would have done what it took to carry a baby , if the option had been there			0
’ although surrogacy would allow them to have a child that is genetically their own , it is banned in some countries and legally and ethically fraught in others			0
mr @entity13 said : ‘ in many women , there is a deep yearning to carry children and this is not fulfilled by surrogacy			1
‘ i ’ve had my own crisis with this project over the years , are we doing the right thing ? ‘ but when you meet women in this position , i know in my heart of hearts that if we do it safely , it is the right thing			0
’ he added that by 2020 , the procedure could be routine enough and inexpensive enough for use on the @entity169			1
fertility expert @entity65 says the risks are not worth taking and some women have to accept they wo n’t become mothers			0
and the @entity174 has reservations about the welfare of the mother and of the child			0
professor @entity179 , a consultant gynaecologist and @entity174 spokesman , said : ‘ significant concerns need to be addressed to everybody ’s satisfaction before we go ahead and offer this as a viable option			1

consultant @entity13 says procedure could be routine enough and inexpensive enough for use on the @entity169 by 2020
