@entity0 has revealed how @entity1 gave him tips and advice about protecting his head in @entity7 football ’s danger zone after seeing him hurt in a collision with @entity11 ’s @entity10			1
@entity0 was forced off after clashing with @entity10 two weeks ago and @entity1 , who required emergency surgery after fracturing his skull at @entity14 in 2006 and still wears a headguard as a result , was keen to share his expertise on the subject			1
the two @entity20 goalkeepers went away on international duty but that did not stop the @entity23 calling and sending text messages to his @entity26 clubmate with advice about using his shoulders and back to protect his head when diving among the boots			2
@entity0 suffered a heavy blow when he came out to challenge @entity10 a fortnight ago @entity10 immediately showed concern for @entity0 as the keeper appeared badly hurt on the pitch @entity0 said : ‘ he told me that in the @entity36 , maybe some strikers really go in against the keepers , so sometimes it is better to protect your head , to go down quicker and with your back or your shoulder protecting your head			1
‘ that was a tip he gave me and it ’s good because , when you come into a new league sometimes things are different			0
‘ in @entity51 there is more organisation , maybe more football , while here maybe some teams are going quicker with the long ball and rushing it to the front			0
the @entity26 was escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room ' it ’s maybe more physical here and maybe the referees do n’t whistle as quick as they do in @entity51			0
’ @entity0 recovered to play twice for @entity65 during the international break and was back in the @entity20 team at @entity68 on saturday , which meant a return to the bench for @entity1 , who had replaced him during the first half against @entity11			2
the two players are duelling for the same place in the team and @entity1 must be smarting having been the club ’s undisputed no 1 for a decade , but it speaks volumes that he is so quick to call and text with offers of help			0
@entity1 was injured in a collision with @entity83 in 2006 , suffering a depressed fracture to his skull @entity1 lies on the floor after the collision , and has worn a protective cap since the incident			1
