by @entity0 the traditional family structure with a father as the breadwinner and a mother who stays home to raise children is becoming increasingly uncommon in @entity8			1
just one in five families fits the ' traditional ' model which has become less popular over the past decade , research shows			0
in @entity8 , 22 per cent of families were made up of a male breadwinner and a female who did not work in 2011 , a slight decline from 23 per cent a decade earlier			2
only one in five @entity8 families fits a traditional structure with a father who works and a mother who stays at home to raise the children the research on modern fatherhood was conducted by the @entity26 , the @entity27 and @entity28 who surveyed 1,500 men across eight countries - @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , the @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity8			2
the results showed that the number of male breadwinners is declining across @entity42 - with @entity37 showing the biggest drop			2
this was attributed to the availability of part - time work and flexible jobs			1
dr @entity48 , from the @entity26 , said : ‘ we are seeing not only a greater level of equality in economic provisioning between parents , but also a growth in new working models involving more part - time and other flexible forms of employment			1
’ a decade ago nearly half of all families were headed by a man , but figures from 2011 show that this has dropped to 28 per cent			0
@entity34 fell from 46 per cent to 36 per cent , while @entity33 and the @entity35 were shown to have the lowest number of working fathers			0
end of an era ? this graph shows how male breadwinners are declining in @entity42 with @entity37 and the @entity35 showing the biggest fall between 2001 and 2011 fathers were also surveyed on how their job affected family life			0
more than a quarter of @entity8 fathers said they are always or often too tired after work to enjoy the things they would like to do at home with their family , and another 35 per cent said they often worry about work problems even when they are not in the office			1
dr @entity84 , of @entity28 , said : ‘ this research shows that in the @entity8 many fathers allow their job to undermine their family life			0
' it suggests that there are lessons we can learn from countries like the @entity35 where fathers appear to have a better work life balance			0
’ professor @entity95 , director of the @entity96 , also said the research showed that many @entity8 fathers allowed their job to encroach on home life			1
she said : ‘ nearly one - third of @entity8 fathers still work over 48 hours a week and a tenth over 60 hours a week			1
‘ if the coalition government is really serious about being family friendly it should sign up to the @entity103 , which will take pressure of @entity8 families and allow parents the choice of sharing work hours between them in a more balanced and modern way			0

the number of @entity8 fathers who bring home the bacon is declining
*housewives* who stay home to look after the children are becoming rarer
