thousands of students converged on a university campus in @entity2 today , launching a week - long boycott of classes in protest against @entity7 's decision to rule out fully democratic elections in the former @entity10 colony			1
students from more than 20 universities and colleges streamed into the grounds of picturesque , bay - side @entity13 , where they were greeted by banners that said : ' the boycott must happen			1
disobey and grasp your destiny			0
' some sat in a circle playing guitars , while others folded leaflets urging students to boycott classes in a protest which coincides with a trip to @entity7 by some of @entity2 's most powerful business tycoons , who are expected to talk about government policies with @entity37 leader @entity36			1
@entity7 decided in august to rule out open nominations for candidates under proposed guidelines for the first - ever elections to choose the city 's top leader , which have been promised for 2017			1
the @entity68 , @entity37 's legislature , instead insists that candidates be vetted by an elite committee that is similar to the body of mostly pro-beijing elites that has until now selected the city 's leaders			1
democracy groups reject such screening for loyalty to @entity7 and demand elections that offer a genuine choice			0
the strike marks the beginning of a week - long boycott of university classes being backed by academics the action coincides with a visit to @entity7 by some of @entity2 's wealthiest business tycoons to discuss government policy with @entity37 leader @entity36 ' i believe on august 31 , when the @entity68 made their decision , it crushed the dreams of some @entity2 people who have been fighting hard for democracy for the past 30 years , ' said third - year student @entity95			1
leading academics in @entity2 have voiced support for the boycott , with some offering to record lectures and post them online for students who miss school to watch later			2
about 380 academics and other school staff have signed a petition supporting the students , saying they should not ' stand alone '			0
' at the minimum , [ the strike ] can provide a wakeup call to tens of thousands of university and secondary school students in @entity2 , ' said @entity112 , a professor at @entity113 and one of the organisers of the signature campaign			2
he added that the organisers are ' trying to inspire many other fellow classmates to be aware of and be devoted to the democratic movement '			0
one in five people say they are considering leaving @entity2 because of concerns over its political future the boycott is being organised by groups such as the @entity126 and @entity127			1
a survey by the @entity13 showed more than a fifth of @entity2 residents are considering leaving the city , spurred by concerns over its political future			1
residents overall feel pessimistic about the current political climate , according to the poll , released yesterday			0
on a scale of zero to 10 , with zero being ' extremely pessimistic ' , the average response was 4.22			0
however , about 46 per cent said they did not support the movement to occupy the @entity58 finance district			1
' @entity2 is on the brink of another wave of mass migration , ' said @entity143 , a professor at the @entity144 who is unaffiliated with the poll			0
' more and more people will leave in the next few years as the election for the chief executive approaches			0
' the city saw waves of migration leading up to the transfer of sovereignty from the @entity10 to @entity37 in 1997 , when tens of thousands left every year			2
@entity156 also surged in the wake of the @entity159 crackdown in 1989 , when @entity7 violently suppressed protests by thousands of students calling for democracy			2
many went to @entity164 , @entity165 and the @entity166 , only to return later as the political and economic situation in @entity2 stabilised			0
@entity2 returned to @entity37 rule with freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland under a policy of ' one country , two systems '			2
@entity37 is terrified those calls will spread to mainland cities , threatening the @entity178 's grip on power .			0
