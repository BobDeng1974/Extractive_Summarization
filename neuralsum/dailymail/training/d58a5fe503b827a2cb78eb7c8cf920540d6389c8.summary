by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 the adult daughter of baby @entity5 's father @entity4 has broken her silence , admitting she was responsible for whispers that the @entity8 believed baby @entity5 was dead			1
in an interview published by local newspaper @entity11 , @entity9 said she had told friends the baby , who has @entity15 , had died because it was simpler than ' dragging them into all the confusion '			2
' my parents never said @entity5 had died , that came from me , ' the newspaper quoted ms @entity9 saying			2
the @entity9 family : featuring @entity9 ( far right ) , @entity4 ( far left ) and @entity27 ( right of @entity4 )			2
@entity29 , pictured here with surrogate child @entity5 , has claimed she was asked to abort him and his twin sister @entity31 seven months in to her pregnancy ' the only reason i told my friends that he had died was that it was easier than dragging them all into the confusion			1
' ' i thought it would be easier to say he had passed away and then have to explain it later on if he came home			0
' ms @entity9 added that baby @entity5 's twin sister , @entity31 , was a happy little girl who only cried during teething			2
she said that mr @entity25 , a convicted child sex offender had done a ' terrible thing ' in the past , but she believed in the integrity of the child protection system			0
overnight @entity50 claimed on @entity51 that @entity4 and @entity27 asked her to abort both children when she was seven months pregnant			1
ms @entity29 also said the agents and doctors caring for were aware that @entity5 had @entity15 early into her pregnancy			1
furthermore , she said she used someone else 's name and @entity58 to register for surrogacy as she was only 19 when she made the agreement with an agency			0
' it was the agent ... she said that they ( the @entity8 ) wanted to abort both of the children '			2
ms @entity29 told the program , adding she broke down in tears when she received this news			1
' she said that the parents had been very shocked and frightened ... they were insisting on the abortion			0
i said i could n't do that ... cause i was seven months into the pregnancy already			2
' ms @entity29 said she was then given the option to abort just one of the children - the one with a disability - though she still refused this as she believed she was too far into the pregnancy			1
' they told me that the child would have to be injected with some drugs ( or poison ) to take his life and then be taken out by surgical process			0
then the girl would go into the incubator right away ... these words have since then stayed in my head ' , ms @entity29 revealed			1
in an interview with a @entity92 news program , she said @entity4 and @entity27 knew months before she did that @entity5 had down @entity93 also in her interview in @entity92 , ms @entity29 said she believed doctors , agents and the @entity97 knew about @entity5 's @entity15 as early as four months into her pregnancy , but they did not notify her until she started having complications around seven months			1
she said she was sent test results to her home throughout her pregnancy , telling her that her babies were healthy and neither had any disability , mental or otherwise			0
' the agency , the doctors as well as the parents knew ( about @entity5 's @entity15 ) already since the fourth month of the pregnancy ' , ms @entity29 claimed			1
' i was getting sick and had to go and stay in the hospital ... around the seventh month of the pregnancy			0
that 's when they told me			0
but before that they have never mentioned anything about it to me			0
' in their first interview since the scandal broke , the @entity8 said on sunday night they would have asked the surrogate mother to terminate the pregnancy if they had known earlier on about @entity5 's disability			2
however they claimed they knew nothing about his condition until around the seven month mark			2
ms @entity29 also said doctors and her surrogacy agents were aware of a condition she carried which may result in any baby being born with a disability , but they did not notify her in @entity133 , laws on the terminations of pregnancies vary state to state , but in @entity133 - where the @entity8 are from - the four month mark would still be considered a safe time to abort the children as it is legal to have an abortion during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy			1
ms @entity29 , who already has two children of her own , also said she believed she was misled by the agents and doctors in charge of her , as they withheld information about a health condition she had			1
when she underwent blood tests prior to carrying the embryo , they showed ms @entity29 had thalassemia , a common blood disorder that can cause stillbirth , a range of growth and learning disorders and heart failure			1
' nobody told me anything ... i asked the agency that if i had this disease ... would that mean that i should not get into pregnancy ? they said that it was okay			0
the doctor said it was alright ' , she told the program			0
' i did n't know that if you have thalassemia there will be great chances that your child will suffer from down - syndrome			0
if the doctor had told me ... probably i would not have gone through with the procedure			0
' the @entity8 , pictured here with @entity5 's twin sister @entity31 , have been at the centre of the surrogacy scandal after ms @entity29 claimed they left @entity5 in @entity92 because of his disability another twist raised by ms @entity29 was that she originally registered for surrogacy using the identity of her partner 's brother 's girlfriend , as she was three months shy of 20 years old at the time			1
' the agency told that is was okay ... that i could use somebody else 's @entity58 instead			0
i did n't know what they were using my name for ... they just told me that they will need give this name to the clinic ... to register myself ' , she said			0
ms @entity29 claimed she did this as she had little knowledge about the surrogacy process , and only changed her name on the forms after she had to sign documents at the embassy .			1
