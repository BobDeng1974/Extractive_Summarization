vets have performed what could be one of the world ’s smallest amputations - on a field mouse run over by a wheelie bin			1
the rodent - called @entity7 - was left with serious injuries when @entity10 , 51 , put out her rubbish at her home in @entity13 , @entity14			1
she scooped up the mouse and took it to @entity16 in nearby @entity17 - and despite a slim chance he would survive , they carried out surgery to remove his crushed leg			1
now , mrs @entity10 has decided to keep @entity7 as a pet - despite admitting she is ' petrified ' of mice			1
vets have since been astounded by the recovery of @entity7 , who has been adopted by @entity41 and her husband @entity42 , 56 , who now live with the animal at their £ 135,000 semi-detached house			0
mr @entity33 told @entity46 that the operation cost the vet 's about £ 200 to perform , but if someone had brought the mouse in for treatment as a pet they would have been charged about £ 150			1
administration worker @entity41 said : ‘ my husband and i love wildlife and we would n’t hurt a fly so we could n’t have left a tiny injured mouse to die outside in the freezing cold			2
‘ even though i ’m petrified of mice , i was mortified when i saw that i ’d hurt him and there was blood coming from his leg			2
@entity33 thought he might not come through the operation			0
up and about : vets have been amazed by the recovery of @entity7 , who has been adopted by the @entity66 couple ‘ but then i got a call saying he had pulled through and i was so relieved			0
he has thrived ever since and is so full of character , with the brightest eyes and the loveliest coat			0
’ @entity7 ’s treatment was paid for by @entity74 ’s £ 3,000 - a - year fund for treating stray animals and is made up of donations - including from marathon runs by mr @entity33 and his wife @entity79			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ his chances of survival were slim , so we had to think carefully before authorising major surgery on such a small animal			2
that decision has certainly proved right as mouse and owner so happy			0
‘ when he came in i said i would fix him if it was possible to do so			0
he would n’t have been able to be released back into the wild but i agreed to amputate if @entity10 was prepared to keep him as a pet			2
removing the leg is relatively easy , it ’s just a bit fiddly , and because @entity7 was so young , he has adapted to life as a pet			0
