by @entity0 published : 19:37 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 19:37 est , 13 june 2012 @entity1 was yesterday urged in the @entity2 to finally end @entity4 ’s decade of suffering and give the @entity7 ’s sufferer ‘ his life back ’			1
the prime minister came under pressure to deliver on his promise to show ‘ compassion ’ towards mr @entity4 , whom the @entity14 accuse of hacking into military computers			1
in @entity18 , both mr @entity1 and @entity17 leader @entity16 promised to help mr @entity4 , who judges and doctors say could take his own life if extradited			1
@entity1 has come under pressure to deliver on his promise to give @entity4 ' his life back ' but , two years after the @entity23 came to power , he remains in limbo - waiting to see if he will be bundled on a plane to the @entity14 , where he faces spending a decade or more behind bars mr @entity4 , now 46 , was first arrested on charges of hacking into @entity30 and @entity31 computers from his north @entity33 home on march 9 , 2002 - meaning he has already spent ten years living in constant fear			1
yesterday , at @entity10 ’s questions , his plight was again raised by the campaigning @entity40 mp @entity39			0
mr @entity39 said : ‘ the prime minister has called for compassion for my constituent @entity4 , who doctors report is likely to take his life if he is extradited			1
mr @entity4 , pictured with his mother @entity45 , was first arrested in 2002 ‘ the deputy prime minister has also said that it would be cruel if he were to be extradited			1
‘ so can the government be true to its word and stop the extradition and finally after ten years give @entity4 his life back ? ’ mr @entity1 replied that the home secretary , @entity52 , was currently considering new medical evidence about the hacker and would reach a decision soon			1
judges have said that , under the very strict terms of the @entity60 / @entity14 extradition deal , it would not be a breach of mr @entity4 ’s rights to bundle him on a plane			2
but his supporters say that the risk of suicide - which has been acknowledged by the courts - should be sufficient grounds for mrs may to intervene			0
a string of @entity71 approved mr @entity4 ’s extradition - severely limiting the options still left open to mrs may			2
she has been studying the medical reports for a number of months , with the courts pressing for a decision in the case before the end of july			0
mrs @entity82 ’s mum , @entity45 , says consultant forensic psychiatrist @entity83 , who is a @entity84 approved expert , considered her son ‘ unfit for trial ’ and at extreme risk of suicide in april 2012			0
his report , which has been sent to mrs may , concluded : ‘ if he survives the transit to the @entity14 , he will be so traumatised that he may remain unfit to plead for a considerable period			0
@entity16 , pictured with mrs @entity45 outside the @entity84 in 2009 , has also pledged his support to mr @entity4 in the past ‘ i strongly recommend that once mr @entity4 has recovered from his current ordeal his trial takes place in the @entity60 ’ the @entity97 has been campaigning for the past three years to halt mr @entity4 ’s extradition to the @entity14 he has also been backed by a string of mps , mental health charities and celebrities , who all argue that he should stand trial in the @entity60			1
his alleged crimes were committed from the bedroom of his north @entity33 flat			0
he hacked into both @entity30 and @entity31 computers while looking for evidence of the existence of ‘ little green men ’			0
mr @entity4 ’s case sparked huge concern over the @entity113 , which opponents argue is lopsided			2
@entity100 have demanded a change in the law so that , in future , @entity60 will be placed on trial in the @entity60 if that is where the bulk of their offending took place			2
mrs may is separately considering a report into where there needs to be significant changes to the extradition treaty , which was signed by @entity71 in 2003 .			0
