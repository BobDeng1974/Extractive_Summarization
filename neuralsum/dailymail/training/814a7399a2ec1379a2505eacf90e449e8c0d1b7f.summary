a dozen chacma baboons clambered into a third floor flat after one of their accomplices managed to get the window open			1
the baboons raided the cabinets , stole food , ripped off the curtains and even made it off with a teddy bear			1
cheeky monkeys : the hairy burglars scaled the block of flats ' brick walls and raided the property even getting their grubby hands on the curtains the hairy burglars scaled the block of flats ' brick walls and raided the property in @entity4 , @entity31 , while its owners were out			1
stunned neighbours and passersby watched in disbelief as the monkeys made off with bedsheets , curtains and the toy after their 30 minute pillage			2
one brazen baboon even appeared to use the salmon - coloured curtains as a disguise when they flee the scene of their crime			2
it is thought they initially entered the flat looking for food - raiding the fridges and trashing the kitchen			0
but it was the big teddy bear that won their affections , as the baboons played with the toy and groomed it like it was another monkey			1
breaking and entering : a group of baboons make their way into a flat in @entity4 which they proceeded to trash completely making friends : one of the baboons scales back down the building holding the family 's teddy bear clever disguise : one of the baboons covered itself in the pink curtains as the group fled the scene with their takings @entity76 , from @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , travelled to @entity4 , @entity31 , to take photographs of the famous baboons in the area			1
the 43 - year - old wildlife photographer and journalist said : ‘ at the beginning , only one of the baboons was inside the flat			0
‘ he opened the wide front windows to the flat with his mouth , and around ten baboons then came into the flat			2
‘ they were in there for more than half an hour as nobody was able to do anything			0
the owners were out and nobody had any keys to enter			0
‘ i am quite used to working with monkeys , but i was amazed			0
and then when they came out with a blanket , curtains and a giant teddy bear , i was even more astonished			1
‘ the baboons played with the teddy bear like a kid plays with a doll			1
they even groomed it like a monkey ! ’ havoc : the owners returned to a completely trashed kitchen after the baboons had their way mr @entity76 added : ‘ it is easy to understand the baboons are looking for food , but they are intelligent and very social animals			0
‘ interactions and social behaviours are a big part of their education to become an adult baboon			0
‘ play seems to be a very good way for the youngsters to learn how to behave as baboon			0
‘ they love to be hidden behind leaves and tree trunks in the wild - i have seen that several times			0
‘ here , they do the same with new materials , like a blanket or curtains			0
‘ but the teddy bear used as a doll is much more of a mystery to me , especially because the adult baboons used it too			1
’ the monkey raids are common in @entity31 , where monitoring teams are employed to try to keep the baboons at bay .			2
