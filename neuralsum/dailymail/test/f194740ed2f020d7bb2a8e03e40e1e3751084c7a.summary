fearing for their lives , hundreds of @entity1 immigrants have begun arriving in their home countries after fleeing the bloody violence that has swept across @entity1			1
among them were some 400 @entity6 – including pregnant women and babies – who were packed onto buses to escape the anti-immigrant attacks that have left seven people dead in recent days			1
they were pictured wearily disembarking in the safe haven of a migration centre in the @entity6 border town of @entity15 after leaving @entity16 yesterday			1
about 3,200 @entity17 have also sought refuge in temporary camps amid the ensuing chaos			0
their plight emerged as @entity1 's influential @entity23 denied whipping up the xenophobic hatred in the country that has forced thousands from their homes			1
but addressing a tribal gathering of several thousand @entity61 in the port city of @entity16 the king insisted he had been taken out of context			2
' my speech ... was directed at the police , calling for stricter law enforcement , but that was never reported , ' he said			0
' the public was instead given another side of my speech , which has been twisted and misrepresented			0
this violence directed at our brothers and sisters is shameful			0
' meanwhile , in @entity17 , information minister @entity77 said six buses carrying 390 @entity17 from @entity16 were sent to @entity17 yesterday , while five more buses were expected to leave today			1
those killed in the anti-immigrant unrest included two @entity17 , according to @entity17 's government			0
louis @entity83 , @entity1 's top diplomat in @entity85 , said his @entity87 mission has warned @entity1 citizens in @entity85 ' to exercise vigilance and limit their movements ' following threats of reprisal attacks			1
@entity17 families fleeing xenophobic violence disembark a bus at @entity97 in @entity98 , after being repatriated from @entity1 a group of 390 @entity17 fleeing xenophobic violence wait at @entity97 in @entity98			1
@entity1 authorities have struggled to contain mobs in the economic capital @entity104 and @entity16 who have been attacking foreigners from @entity6 , @entity17 , @entity107 and other @entity1 countries similarly , security was increased at the @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 , after telephoned threats , said @entity114 , the high commissioner			1
activists in some @entity1 countries have also organised protests and called for a boycott of @entity1 goods as @entity1 is a powerful trading partner in the region			1
@entity122 , a @entity123 - based company , said it temporarily repatriated its 62 @entity1 workers at a titanium mine in @entity107 after ' reciprocal unrest ' there that stemmed from the @entity1 violence			2
the mine 's total workforce is nearly 1,400			0
the outbreak of violence in @entity1 against immigrants has tarnished the reputation of a country that has one of the biggest economies on the continent and has been a destination for people seeking opportunity and an escape from turbulence elsewhere in @entity1			1
horrific pictures released yesterday showed a @entity107 man bleeding to death in a gutter after being savagely attack by a gang who stabbed him with knives and bludgeoned him with a wrench in @entity152 near @entity104			0
in a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself			0
@entity1 was also dubbed the ' rainbow nation ' for its relatively peaceful transition to democracy after the end of white racist rule in 1994			2
attack : shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround @entity171 and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in @entity152 near @entity104 now the government is struggling to contain negative fallout from attacks on immigrants in some areas of @entity16 and @entity104 that killed seven people since the end of march			1
professor @entity182 , an @entity1 diplomacy and foreign policy expert at the @entity185 said the @entity1 government should be ' less reactive and more proactive ' in dealing with tensions over immigrants			1
he said the country should ' be a bit more humble ' about its aspirations as a continental leader , adding : ' we are in denial			0
' @entity23 , an influential figure among the @entity61 ethnic group in @entity1 , condemned the attacks in a speech monday at a @entity16 sports stadium			1
his remarks followed allegations that he provoked the violence with reported comments in which he said foreigners should go home			2
doctors tried in vain to save mr @entity171 's life			0
his cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket president @entity219 postponed a ceremony , scheduled for next week , in which the country 's highest official honor is bestowed on @entity1 and foreigners who have contributed to @entity1 , his office said			2
the event will be postponed so @entity1 can mourn the victims of the anti-immigrant violence , including three @entity1 and four foreigners , it said			2
the attacks in @entity1 stem from a perception that immigrants , many from other @entity1 countries , are taking jobs at the expense of @entity1 in a country with high unemployment			1
many people have entered @entity1 illegally , though the government has said a large number of immigrants are working legally and contributing to economic development			2
the violence recalls similar unrest in @entity1 in 2008 in which 60 people died			0
in january this year , four people died during looting of foreign - owned shops in areas of @entity104			0
the violence is particularly unfortunate because other @entity1 nations provided shelter and other aid to @entity1 activists during the battle against white minority rule , said @entity114 , the @entity1 diplomat in @entity112			0
' the young people have forgotten the contribution of @entity1 countries to @entity1 's fight against apartheid and need to be educated on this , ' she said .			0
