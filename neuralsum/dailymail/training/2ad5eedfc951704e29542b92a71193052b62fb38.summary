by @entity0 and @entity1 for the @entity2 and @entity3 for the @entity2 @entity5 contestant @entity4 has revealed she left the show not because of the ice cream pudding controversy , but because she lost her sense of smell and taste in a freak accident			1
viewers of this week ’s @entity5 saw one contestant ’s ice cream pudding reduced to slush in an apparent act of sabotage by @entity17 , causing her rival to storm off and also be eliminated from the competition			2
the grandmother has since railed against the @entity23 show 's producers , claiming their editing ' fakery ' made it appear as though it was a deliberate act of sabotage			1
she has also now clarified that she left the show because she fainted and banged her head during supper with the other contestants just before production of the following episode was due to start			1
in a freak accident , the pensioner , who lives near @entity33 in @entity34 , said : ' i fainted - which i have never done - and bashed my head , severing my olfactory nerve			2
so i have now lost my sense of smell and most of my taste			2
' she added that she has some sensation of foods which are very salty or vinegary , but has been told by a specialist that nothing medically can be done to repair the damage and she may never fully recover her senses			0
stroll down for video upset : @entity4 , 69 , pictured at her home in @entity34 , says she has been unfairly blamed for a rival 's failed @entity52 on last night 's show - it later emerged that she never returned to the show wednesday night 's show descended into chaos when bearded competitor @entity59 binned his pudding after the ice cream melted in the @entity63 heat and stormed out of the tent @entity65 - who at 69 is the show 's oldest ever contestant - was clearly seen removing his pudding from the freezer despite being warned by another that it belonged to him - but mrs @entity4 said today she was the victim of a ' stitch up ' meltdown : this is the moment @entity59 decided he had to bin his @entity52 after it collapsed @entity73 - haired mrs @entity4 , 69 , wept as she claimed the corporation had cast her as the villain , deliberately editing the show to make it look as if she had left the dessert out of the freezer for several minutes			1
the @entity80 reported she said : ' it 's a form of fakery and trickery			0
' they deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the sake of entertainment			0
the @entity23 should be ashamed			2
' the scandal is the biggest to hit @entity90 off since last year ’s @entity92 drama , when one contestant tearfully admitted taking another ’s custard to use in a trifle			0
getting to the soggy bottom of the baked @entity98 incident , however , was proving rather more difficult last night			0
the story starts on wednesday when 8million viewers watched bearded @entity59 , 31 , throw a wobbly when he found his dessert had been reduced to a splodge after mrs @entity4 took it out of the freezer			1
@entity4 says the knives have been out for her and she sobbed after watching the show last night mr @entity59 , 31 , screamed in frustration and was knocked out of the competition after he walked up to judges @entity108 and @entity110 with a bin in his hand instead of a pudding he was eliminated after he presented it in a bin to judges @entity108 and @entity110 , then stormed off set			1
that led to mrs @entity4 , from @entity34 , being pilloried as a cheat in cruel online comments			1
there were more than 550 complaints to the @entity23			2
she , however , insisted the recording had been edited to make it seem as if she had left the meringue and ice cream dessert out for minutes , rather than seconds			2
‘ they deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the sake of entertainment , ’ she said			0
‘ the @entity23 should be ashamed			2
‘ the cake was out of the freezer for 40 seconds and i was asking who it belonged to			0
then @entity59 walked over and took it away			0
it happened as simply as that			0
‘ @entity59 did n’t blame me at all			0
i was very disappointed and upset by how they cleverly edited the show and as a result i have people saying all sorts of nasty things about me			0
’ what happened to @entity59 's baked @entity98 and is the @entity23 to blame for its destruction ? others pointed out that wednesday ’s episode had been filmed in a tent in the may heatwave			1
fellow competitor @entity148 , 33 , said some freezers had not worked properly in the heat and added : ‘ poor @entity4 is a scapegoat for @entity23			1
’ the @entity23 has received at least 811 complaints about the episode , and the regulator @entity155 received another 13 - a baker 's dozen			1
twelve of the complaints to @entity155 were raising concerns about the apparent sabotage of the bearded baker 's dessert , the regulator said			1
but today the regulator confirmed it will not investigate further , saying : ' having assessed viewers ’ complaints received to date , they do not raise issues warranting further investigation under @entity155 ’s rules			1
' a spokesman added that if further complaints are raised they will be addressed			0
judge @entity108 , 79 , said his behaviour was ' unacceptable ' and refused to put him through to the next round the @entity176 construction engineer won the sympathy of many who felt he had been the victim of an underhand plot by his rivals how the @entity2 reported on wednesday 's scandal even mr @entity59 said : ‘ i do n’t hold @entity4 responsible in any way			1
there are no grudges , we are still friends and keep in contact regularly			0
’ however , he disputed the claim that the dessert was out of the freezer for only 40 seconds or so , saying it must have been longer because otherwise it would not have melted so much			0
a @entity23 spokesman said : ‘ @entity4 removing @entity59 ’s ice cream from the freezer for less than a minute was in no way responsible for @entity59 ’s departure			1

@entity4 says ' knives are out ' for her and she cried after seeing show
