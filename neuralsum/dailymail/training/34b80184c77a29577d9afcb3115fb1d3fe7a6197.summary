by @entity0 published : 22:56 est , 15 august 2013 @entity2 : 00:59 est , 16 august 2013 the @entity4 has broken privacy rules or overstepped its legal authority thousands of times each year since @entity8 granted the agency broad new powers in 2008 , the @entity3 reported thursday			1
most of the infractions involve unauthorized surveillance of @entity14 or foreign intelligence targets in the @entity14 , both of which are restricted by law and executive order			1
they range from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interception of @entity14 emails and telephone calls , the @entity3 said , citing an internal audit and other top - secret documents provided it earlier this summer from @entity4 leaker @entity27 , a former systems analyst with the agency			1
busted : the @entity4 broke privacy rules thousands of times since it was granted broad new powers in 2008 in one of the documents , agency personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic language in reports to the @entity37 and the @entity38			2
the @entity3 cited a 2008 example of the interception of a ' large number ' of calls placed from @entity43 when a programming error confused @entity14 area code 202 for 20 , the international dialing code for @entity47 , according to a ' quality assurance ' review that was not distributed to the @entity4 's oversight staff			1
in what the @entity3 said appeared to be one of the most serious violations , the @entity4 diverted large volumes of international data passing through fiber - optic cables in the @entity14 into a repository where the material could be stored temporarily for processing and selection			1
the operation collected and commingled @entity14 and foreign emails , the @entity3 said , citing a top - secret internal @entity4 newsletter			1
@entity4 lawyers told the @entity65 that the agency could not practicably filter out the communications of @entity14			1
in october 2011 , months after the program got underway , the court ruled that the collection effort was unconstitutional			0
the @entity71 reported that 1,904 of the incidents appeared to be ' roamers ' - foreign nationals whose cell phones were being wiretapped without warrants who then came to the @entity14 according to the audit , a sharp increase in such incidents in a single quarter could have resulted from @entity83 citizens traveling to the @entity14 to celebrate the @entity84 with family			1
' we 're a human - run agency operating in a complex environment with a number of different regulatory regimes , so at times we find ourselves on the wrong side of the line , ' a senior @entity4 official said in an interview , speaking to the newspaper with @entity96 permission on the condition of anonymity			2
he added , ' you can look at it as a percentage of our total activity that occurs each day			0
you look at a number in absolute terms that looks big , and when you look at it in relative terms , it looks a little different			0
' the @entity4 audit obtained by the @entity3 dated may 2012 , counted 2,776 incidents in the preceding 12 months of unauthorized collection , storage , access to or distribution of legally protected communications			2
many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure			0
the most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 @entity14 and green - card holders			1
the @entity126 : @entity27 gave documents outlining the infractions to the @entity3 earlier this summer the documents included a level of detail and analysis that is not routinely shared with @entity8 or the special court that oversees surveillance , the paper said			0
in one of the documents , agency personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic language in reports to the @entity37 and the @entity38			0
in an emailed statement to @entity0 late thursday , @entity140 , @entity4 's director of compliance , said , ' we want people to report if they have made a mistake or even if they believe that an @entity4 activity is not consistent with the rules			0
' @entity4 , like other regulated organizations , also has a " hotline " for people to report - and no adverse action or reprisal can be taken for the simple act of reporting			2
' we take each report seriously , investigate the matter , address the issue , constantly look for trends and address them as well - all as a part of @entity4 's internal oversight and compliance efforts			0
what 's more , we keep our overseers informed through both immediate reporting and periodic reporting			0
' director of national intelligence @entity166 claimed during a @entity169 hearing that the @entity4 does n't collect information on innocent @entity14 president @entity171 recently pledged to provide more transparency and oversight in the @entity4 surveillance programs			2
the issue has divided the @entity8 , with some representatives among them @entity180 @entity179 @entity178 , insisting that data collection is critical to national security , while others criticizing the intelligence agency for going to far in their efforts			0
some members of the @entity187 , including @entity189 @entity188 of @entity190 , have been trying for some time to get the @entity4 to give some kind of accounting of how much data it collects " incidentally " on @entity14 through various electronic dragnets			1
the @entity171 administration has strongly resisted such disclosures .			0

the violations range from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interception of @entity14 emails and telephone calls
in 2008 , the @entity4 intercepted a ' large number ' of calls placed from @entity43 when a programming error confused @entity14 area code 202 for 20 , the international dialing code for @entity47
the most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 @entity14 and green - card holders
