by @entity0 with @entity2 , @entity3 and sir @entity4 among fans of his work , it 's safe to say that artist @entity7 has no shortage of celebrity followers			1
now the a-list favourite has turned his paintbrush on @entity12 for his third collection of paintings , a @entity15			1
the works , which will go on display in @entity18 for the first time on friday , include versions of some of @entity23 's most iconic sights as well as haunting depictions of the desolate desert panoramas that surround @entity12			2
spectacular : the new exhibition by @entity29 artist @entity7 offers an abstract take on @entity12 along with the pool at a-list favourite @entity32 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37 also get the @entity39 treatment , rendered lonely and haunting in his work			1
the @entity18 - born artist has made a name for himself thanks to his woozily abstract style of painting and deconstructed landscapes			2
described by @entity46 as ' a new art superstar ' , @entity39 , currently one of the @entity29 's most important contemporary artists , was even favourably compared to @entity49 by @entity51 art critic @entity50			2
yet despite the beauty of his work , @entity7 says the drawings of @entity54 - created after he was sectioned - were an early inspiration			0
famous fans : sir @entity4 ( left ) and 12 years a slave star @entity2 ( right ) big name supporter : @entity7 with actress and long time fan @entity3 at one of his exhibitions speaking to @entity51 , he explained : i think the drawings i had a book of were from his years in an asylum â € “ these bizarre interactions between human form and insects			1
' my headspace was filled with this completely traditional form of painting infused with the completely surreal			0
' while his own work has a surreal quality of its own , his delicately rendered @entity12 tableaux are far from bizarre , and rather than getting him sectioned , are more than likely to win him a few more a-list fans			0
@entity2 might just have to start paying more for his decor			0
a splendid isolation is curated by @entity79 and opens on 28th march at the new gallery space at @entity81 on @entity82			0
