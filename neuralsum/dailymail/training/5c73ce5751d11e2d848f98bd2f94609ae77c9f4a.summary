the defence lawyer has spent considerable time in previous hearings dwelling on miss @entity0 's drinking habits			1

' all of which can be corroborated , unlike the defence 's story			0
' while he attacked my daughter 's character , he forgot to mention that his clients regularly frequented bars and consumed alcohol			0
' mrs @entity0 also said the defence lawyer did not address what the men are accused of doing to her daughter 's body following her death			2
she argued : ' if it was self - defence , why did the lawyer not mention them removing my daughter 's body to the desert by car , purchasing coal and fuel and burning her body beyond recognition and then going back to the scene to make sure they had burnt her body ? ' if it was self - defence , would you do that ? ' during yesterday 's hearing , the lawyer for the @entity128 family asked that their request for 20 million @entity132 , Â£ 3.5million , in compensation from the convicted men be referred to a civil court			2
