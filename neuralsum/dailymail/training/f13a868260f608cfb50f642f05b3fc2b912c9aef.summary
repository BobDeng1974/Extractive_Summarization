now the @entity15 has criticised him for bringing ' shame and obloquy ' on his profession and becoming the object of ' jokes and ridicule '			1
inappropriate : judge @entity8 sent this nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff @entity8 admitted in april that he had sent a naked picture of the top half of his body to court bailiff @entity27			1

' a ruling issued yesterday by the @entity15 allowed @entity8 to keep his job , but ordered that he be publicly censured for his antics			1
the court declared that the judge ' conducted himself in a flippant manner and did not give the interview the seriousness he should have			2
as a result , he brought shame and obloquy to the judiciary			1
' it also referred to the worldwide furore over the photograph , noting : ' the interview , and the digital image , spread rapidly around the internet and became the subject of jokes and ridicule			2
' @entity58 : @entity8 , a specialist in sex misconduct cases on @entity61 's @entity60 , batted away claims sending a semi-naked shower picture via mobile phone was ' totally inappropriate ' ms @entity27 apparently told officials she used the picture ' as inspiration to motivate her to improve her workouts and eating habits '			1

i 've got no shame in my game			2
i ai n't talking to nobody else 's wife			0

his seemingly arrogant stance has angered his colleague 's husband			0
the court bailiff 's spouse said : ' it 's totally inappropriate			0
it says a lot that he 's flawed			0
' he 's not what he appears to be , at least not to the general public because he has access to kids , he has access to different charitable functions			0
