by @entity0 published : 07:03 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 19:53 est , 25 october 2012 given that there are 41 independent coffee shops in the area , there is clearly an appetite for the occasional cappuccino			1
but when @entity8 announced plans to open a branch in @entity11 , it left a very bitter taste			2
residents feared the arrival of the chain would ruin the south @entity18 market town ’s identity and turn it into a ‘ clone ’			1
storm of protest : @entity8 was forced to pull out of @entity11 , pictured , after residents in the town fought to preserve its independence so determined were locals to keep @entity26 off their picturesque medieval streets that the town , which has a population of 8,336 , produced a petition of almost 6,000 signatures and held protest marches and meetings			1
and three months later , in a rare triumph of people power over big business , the ‘ no to @entity26 ’ campaign has scored a remarkable victory			2
yesterday the chain announced that fierce opposition from residents had forced it to abandon its plans for a 70 - seat cafe in the town			2
in a statement on their website , the campaigners said they were ‘ absolutely delighted ’ by the company ’s decision to withdraw			0
5,000 local people signed a petition to stop @entity26 building a coffee shop in the town as residents pride themselves on independent coffee shops , right they continued : ‘ we are impressed @entity26 has taken the time to understand our town , its economy and the 5,700 people who signed the petition asking @entity26 to reconsider			1
‘ this is a major milestone for local communities and is a day when the value of localism comes into its own			0
’ brasserie owner @entity65 said : ‘ we ’re happy with the decision @entity26 has made			2
‘ @entity11 is pretty independent and different as a town , and we ’re seeking to protect that			1
’ @entity26 ’s climbdown was announced in a letter from the company which was also signed by @entity73 mp @entity72 and @entity11 mayor @entity74 – who thanked the coffee giant ‘ for being prepared to listen to our concerns and showing that they care ’			1
dr @entity72 said : ‘ costa have considered all the issues and decided that they will not come to @entity11			0
result : brasserie owner @entity65 said : ¿ we ¿ re happy with the decision @entity26 has made			0
@entity11 is pretty independent and different as a town , and we ¿ re seeking to protect that ' ‘ i welcome that decision and want to thank @entity26 for being prepared to listen to those concerns			1
’ the coffee shop had been given planning permission by @entity87 – but that decision was greeted by a 150 - strong group of placard - wielding demonstrators who marched through the town ’s streets			2
the @entity94 campaign was also supported by former resident and author @entity96 , who once won a literary award from the @entity99 group which owns the coffee chain			0
of @entity26 ’s 2,344 @entity102 stores , 19 are in @entity18 , where it employs nearly 200 people			2

earlier this month , the founder of @entity26 said it had too many branches			0
@entity112 - born @entity26 , 70 , who created the company with his brother @entity114 in the 1970s , likened the chain to supermarket monolith @entity117 and said @entity26 had taken over in his home town of @entity119 , @entity120 , where a sixth branch is due to open			1
before the dramatic retreat , a spokesman for @entity26 had insisted the company would ‘ aim to complement the local offering and support the local community ’ in @entity11			1
@entity126 : the town boasts 41 independent coffee outlets and is well - known in the @entity129 for its ' alternative ' image but in yesterday ’s letter , managing director @entity131 wrote : ‘ in all communities in which we operate , we seek to be a force for good , contributing to growth , creating jobs and supporting our local community			1
‘ in making this decision @entity26 has recognised the strength of feeling in @entity11 against national brands and taken into account the specific circumstances of @entity11			1
‘ @entity11 is a town with a long and proud history of independent retailers			1
it has one of the lowest percentage of branded stores of any town of its size in the @entity102 , very few empty shop fronts , as well as a very high proportion of places selling coffee			0
’ campaigner @entity158 said he was ‘ flabbergasted ’ by the ‘ good sense ’ the firm had shown			0

we are an independent town and we do n’t want a clone high street			0
’ @entity167 , co-owner of @entity168 , said : ‘ it ’s surprising that they ’ve made the decision after everything seemed to be set			0
i ’ve never heard of a big company like @entity26 doing anything like this before			0
