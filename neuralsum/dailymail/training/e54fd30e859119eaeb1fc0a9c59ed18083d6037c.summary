well what are we going to do now ? how are we going to survive without our daily @entity3 tv treat ? when ’s the next one ? no doubt the type of questions posed amongst friends and work colleagues the morning after the memorable @entity8 drew to a fittingly dramatic climax with @entity10 beating @entity11 late in extra-time on sunday evening			1
an audience of 20.6million @entity15 viewers watched the @entity3 final , the vast majority , as expected on the @entity18 , as both football fans and those less committed , were drawn to a tournament that has surpassed expectations for excitement and audience engagement			1
@entity38 averaged 2.9m viewers , peaking at 3.9m			0
this has been a @entity3 that has caught the imagination of a wider public and been a shot in the arm for free - to - air broadcasting			1
a @entity15 @entity46 , with the next two @entity47 already contractually secured , the @entity3 , in their entirety , remain the protected domain of the @entity18 and @entity38 for the foreseeable future			1
and it would seem the two broadcasting giants fully appreciate what they ’ve got			0
they have scheduled the matches generously			0
there has been plenty of room to preview and review the action and also to get a sense of the fun and festivities over there in @entity64			0
this has also been the first @entity3 to truly combine traditional viewing and the new and growing breed of online users			1
high flyer : @entity70 made an airbourne entrance on the @entity18 's @entity3 coverage maestro : @entity70 ( right ) excelled in his presenting role during the @entity3 one for the future : former @entity77 defender @entity76 showed he could have a career in media signing off : @entity81 's career at the @entity18 ended with sunday night 's @entity3 final @entity83 lauds near - perfect tournament both broadcasters can take satisfaction from their coverage of the event			1
@entity89 has less sport than in its glory years but can still rise to the occasion and deliver memorable television			0
@entity70 ’s presentation of the tournament has been outstanding – his journey from top - class striker to top - class tv presenter is now complete			1
he ’s handled the whole proceedings with enthusiasm and eloquence			0
and , when reaching for his glasses to read a news story , there ’s even been a touch of @entity106 about him			0
loved or unloved , he has enjoyed being at the @entity3 and it ’s showed			1
and whilst @entity38 ’s beach - side ‘ studio ’ , complete with knee - caps , was slightly over-done , it showed they had confidence in what they were about			1
perhaps the ‘ spirit of the 1970 @entity38 @entity117 ’ was in play			0
@entity76 clearly proved himself to be ‘ tomorrow ’s ’ man in the punditry stakes , as @entity18 ’s @entity81 bade farewell			2
@entity121 put in a string of positive studio shifts and @entity124 and @entity125 both gave @entity18 bosses serious options for more studio and co-commentary work in the future			1
beach boys ( from left ) : @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity107 , @entity135 and @entity136 interesting : @entity136 's hair was battered by the wind but his analysis was spot on for @entity38 the first of many : @entity143 can be excused for the first goal but his defending was woeful throughout on @entity38 , @entity136 spoke like somebody who should still be at the very heart of the game , whilst @entity133 has that wonderful touch of knowing his stuff but delivering it in a marvelously circuitous way			1
a week or so ago on @entity152 , @entity151 was asked whether this was the best @entity3 ever			2
typically , @entity151 qualified his response			0
‘ it has been great but still needs a great game to define it			0
’ within 24 hours we watched agog on @entity18 as @entity10 scored four goals in six minutes in their 7 - 1 demolition of hosts @entity64			2
this @entity3 had its memorable match , and some			2
a final salute should go to @entity162 , the production arm that brought the matches to our screens			2
for over four and a half weeks their sure - handed match direction has captured the action perfectly and it is nice to know that the @entity170 itself was directed by an @entity172 , @entity173			0
this has been a hugely enjoyable @entity3 for viewers to watch , and one that @entity178 ’s early exit , failed to diminish			2
we wanted a ‘ football party ’ and we truly got one			0
video lessons to be learned from @entity3 - @entity183			1

an audience of 20.6million watched the @entity3 final in the @entity15
@entity70 's journey to top - class presenter is now complete
@entity76 , @entity136 , @entity125 , @entity124 all impressed
