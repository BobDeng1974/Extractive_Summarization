a council spent a staggering £ 200,000 on a hunt for a notorious internet blogger known as ‘ mr monkey ’ after he insulted local councillors			1
the anonymous writer referred to councillors as ‘ @entity8 ’ , ‘ @entity9 ’ , ‘ @entity10 ’ and ‘ @entity11 ’ as he promised to ‘ expose the truth ’ behind their alleged lies			1
despite the internet troll abandoning the blog in 2009 , the north east council have only just called off the manhunt - having spent the last five years searching for him			1
@entity19 in @entity20 launched the search after insisting it had a ' duty of care ' to protect employees from malicious accusations made by a blogger known as ' mr monkey ' @entity19 launched the search after insisting they had a ‘ duty of care ’ to protect their employees from malicious accusations made online			1
they immediately hired @entity33 lawyers @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , to try and trace those responsible - all funded by the public purse			0
but after spending more than £ 214,000 on the search for mr @entity3 , town hall bosses have now decided to drop the hunt			1
last night the council investigation was branded a ' ludicrous ' waste of money			0
@entity44 , a spokesman for the @entity45 , said : ' pursuing this claim at the expense of hard - pressed taxpayers was ludicrous and the investigation has wasted thousands of pounds			0
good sense has finally prevailed , but taxpayers have had to foot a massive bill in the meantime			0
' the mr @entity3 blog first appeared in 2008 where defamatory comments were made about @entity19 leader @entity56 , @entity58 colleague @entity57 , the late @entity59 and @entity61 councillor @entity60 and council regeneration boss @entity62			1
in the blog – which at its prime was getting over 4,000 hits a day – mr @entity3 used nicknames for the workers as he went on to label them ‘ f * * * wits ’ , ‘ lazy ’ and ‘ scheming , lying , cheating and corrupt w * * * * * * ’			2
the council suspected there was also a connection between several twitter accounts and ' mr monkey ' and , as a result , the courts in @entity75 forced @entity82 to hand over private account details of some of its users nicknames included @entity9 , @entity8 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 ’ , @entity10 of @entity91 and @entity11			1
mr @entity3 ’s aim was to ‘ focus on political news and gossip in @entity95 … and leave no stone unturned in an attempt to expose the truth ’			1
he accused some of the leaders of vote rigging , claiming expenses for ‘ piss ups ’ , and documented their alleged drunken misadventures and dodgy affairs			0
the blog also had a ‘ @entity107 ’ , and detailed private information about the potential parliamentary candidates , as well as commenting on their fashion sense			0
in 2009 he became aware of workers at the council trying to silence him , to which he responded : ‘ it seems senior councillors and a handful of council officers have become so obsessed with mr @entity119 that they ’ll stop at nothing to close it down			1
’ the blogger alleged that council officers tried to censor the blog by barring access to it from council owned computers			1
employees of the council were said to have asked legal action to be taken against the anonymous blogger but mr @entity3 said the executive of the council originally refused this action , which left them feeling ‘ angry ’ and ‘ frustrated ’			2
mr @entity3 added : ‘ imagine what the public would say about a council who spends hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers money chasing a monkey and all because the @entity89 ca n’t face the prospect of being labelled as a couple of scheming , lying , cheating and corrupt w * * * * * *			1
’ defamatory comments were made on the ' mr @entity3 ' blog - which received about 4,000 visits a day , about council leader @entity56 ( right ) and @entity61 councillor @entity60 ( left ) , as well as various other councillors in july 2009 , for exact reasons unknown , mr @entity3 said after causing ‘ mayhem in the corridors of power ’ he would no longer be posting any new material on the blog			1
he said he had spent months agonising over whether to retire , but had finally decided to spend more time with his family			0
but despite no blog posts appearing on the site since , council bosses continued to spend taxpayers money on trying to find him			2
at some point in 2009 , the council instructed the @entity165 lawyers to try to find out those responsible , insisting it had a ‘ duty of care ’ towards its staff			1
the firm produced an 18 - page dossier in july 2011 which said mr @entity3 was most likely a two - man operation and that libel action would be ‘ highly successful ’ if pursued through the @entity172 or @entity165 courts			0
the case was taken to the @entity165 , because that is where @entity176 , the online publishing platform for the blog , is based , and the council wanted to unmask the person behind the site			0
' pursuing this claim at the expense of hard - pressed taxpayers was ludicrous and the investigation has wasted thousands of pounds			0
' - @entity44 , @entity45 the council suspected there was also a connection between several twitter accounts and mr @entity3			2
as a result , the courts in @entity75 ended up forcing @entity82 to hand over private account details of some of its users - but it did not lead them to the mystery blogger			0
on june 17 , the council abandoned its legal action after a freedom of information request was submitted asking about the current bill			0
they wrote to the courts in the @entity165 and the case was dismissed			0
a council spokesman said : ‘ the council took legal action because it has a duty of care to protect its staff and officials from the kind of harassment and intimidation caused by this malicious and libellous blog , which , if left unchallenged , would have seriously damaged the reputations of innocent people			2
‘ since the council initiated the action in 2009 , the libellous comments have stopped and there have been no new postings on the blog			2
‘ taking legal action attracted some criticism , but as a council we felt it was our duty to mount this challenge in order to protect people from cyber-bullying and harassment			2
‘ we stand by this principle			0
