council chiefs have been blamed for leaving their town a ' laughing stock ' after @entity4 lights were finally put up today - a month late			1
while most people were preparing to take down their @entity4 decorations today on the @entity8 , @entity5 were erecting illuminations in @entity11 town centre in the @entity12			1
the late decorations come following a row over a set of bulbs and talks had held with local people to help solve the argument over replacing the £ 600 set of lights			1
the illuminations were put up today , a month late the late decorations come following a row over a set of bulbs			1
but rather than waiting until next year to put up the lights , the council decided to put them up today and rebranded them as ' @entity33 ' but the decision came too late for contractors to carry out the work in time for the @entity4 period			1
and rather than waiting until next year , the authority has decided to erect the tree decorations this week - and rebranded the display as ' @entity33 ' instead			1
today furious residents and local councillors slammed the council and described the move as a ' joke '			2
chairman of @entity47 @entity46 said : ' we are very angry about this			0
the town has been treated very badly			0
' our councillors pushed very hard to get us some better lights but to no avail			0
' eventually , two days before @entity55 , officers came to us and said they had got the funding for some new lights but it was too late for the contractors to get them up			0
' they said it will be done this month and the display will be called winter lights instead			0
' we do n’t think it is good enough at all			0
' @entity64 of @entity47 who had been involved in a row over the lights with @entity5 shop owner @entity67 , 44 , added : ' everyone feels really let down by the council			1
' we must be the only town in the country who is putting their @entity4 decorations up in the @entity74 - we are a laughing stock			1
while another resident @entity76 , 67 , added : ' the lights the council usually put up are very tacky and minimalistic			2
' i was delighted when i heard they had paid for new ones but when we heard it would n’t be going up until after @entity4 it became a farce			0
' it is the @entity8 and everyone is taking their decorations down and here we are putting up ours			2
however , @entity5 has defended the decision to install the lights after the festive period , saying the new display will look ' amazing '			2
councillor @entity94 , cabinet member for regeneration , said : ' the original lights , which were deemed unsafe and no longer fit for purpose , were removed in preparation for the new scheme			0
@entity5 , pictured , have defended the decision to install the lights after the festive period , saying the new display will look ' amazing ' ' the new lights , which are being installed for future use , will look amazing as hundreds of @entity105 bulbs will bring sparkle and light to the @entity108			2
' according to the tradition , @entity4 decorations should come down on the @entity8 which officially falls on january 5			1
other people maintain the actual date falls on the @entity113 on january 6 and churches often keep manger decorations up as part of their services			0
the @entity113 marks the visit of the three @entity119 to the baby jesus and in which he was revealed as the son of @entity122 .			0

a row meant @entity4 lights were *delayed* in being put up
*problem* was solved but it was too late to put them up before @entity4
instead @entity5 put them up today , on the day of the @entity8
locals say the authority has made the town look like a ' laughing stock '
the decorations have been rebranded as ' @entity33 ' by the council
