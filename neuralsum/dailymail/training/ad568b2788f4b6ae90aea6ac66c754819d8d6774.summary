@entity1 's cricketers may have slumped to a one - day international series defeat in @entity3 , but the team spirit seems to remain undamaged			1
that 's judging by a tweet from batsman @entity7 , who gave his team - mates the chance to play a prank on him when he forgot to lock his hotel room door			2
his fellow @entity1 players wasted no time in making @entity7 regret the error of his ways by dumping the entire contents of his room on top of his bed			2
@entity7 tweeted the above image of his hotel room after accidentally leaving the door unlocked @entity7 ( right ) in action at the batting crease for @entity1 in the fifth one day international in @entity3 but @entity7 , who saw the funny side of the joke , seems to know who the pranksters are			1
alongside the image of his ruined room , the @entity31 batsman wrote the caption ' i guess i deserve it for not locking my room door			0
# @entity37 ? @ alexhales1 @entity38 '			0
@entity1 are 4 - 2 down in the one day series against @entity3 with the final match set to take place in @entity43 on tuesday			1
@entity7 should be in the side as the tourists look to sign off with a win			0
@entity7 believes @entity47 is one of the culprits who trashed his room after leaving it unlocked			0

@entity1 are *approaching* the *end* of a seven - match tour of @entity3
the hosts have an *unassailable* 4 - 2 lead with only one match remaining
but *morale* appears to be high among the *members* of the @entity1 camp
