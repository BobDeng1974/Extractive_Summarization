published : 10:56 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 06:22 est , 8 march 2013 a ' @entity1 ' couple renounced their religion to have the first civil wedding ceremony in @entity4 - and then had to keep it secret for two months			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , both @entity8 , did not tell anyone they had tied the knot after deciding to take a secret stand against the country 's restrictive marriage laws			1
they are from different @entity16 sects , @entity17 and @entity18 , and had to erase their @entity16 faith from their id cards before they were allowed the civil ceremony			0
the couple then convinced a mayor in the east of the war - torn country , which was riven by civil conflict from 1975 to 1990 , to marry them under an ancient loophole that allows non-religious people to be wed. now they are at the centre of a nationwide backlash over whether civil ceremonies should be introduced			0
a day to remember : @entity6 ( left ) and @entity7 ( right ) are pictured on their wedding day			2
the pair are the first to have entered a civil union in @entity4 happy : the couple 's civil union has sparked a fierce debate on marriage laws in the country and the pair hope that their example will see the law eventually relaxed couples from one of the country 's 18 different religions normally have to travel 125 miles to @entity54 , the nearest place they can enter a civil partnership			1
but @entity6 and @entity7 became the first pairing to hold such a ceremony on @entity4 soil , marrying in @entity60 in the east of the country last november			1
@entity64 teacher @entity6 , 29 , told @entity65 : ' @entity4 is a country based on sectarianism , once civil marriage is legalised , this means that the first column of sectarianism is broken			2
' in order to hold the ceremony , the pair had to remove their religious sects - @entity17 and @entity18 - from their national identity cards , a practice which has been legal in the country since 2009			2
after obtaining papers from their local mayor , they could then take advantage of an obscure 1936 law that allows people who do not belong to a particular religious denomination to enter a civil union			0
the pair kept the wedding secret for two months while the interior ministry approved the marriage but decided to go public when confirmation of their union had still not arrived last month			1
going public : the pair kept their union secret while they waited for registration paperwork to come through , but they went public after waiting two months without getting the union rubber stamped the pair have since received overwhelming support on social media websites a @entity106 group called @entity107 ... w @entity104 ( we had a civil marriage ... may you as well ) , set up for those married in civil unions abroad to share their pictures has attracted 25,000 ' likes ' within days of its launch			1
but prime minister @entity115 said that civil union is a contentious issue that @entity4 does n't need right now			2
@entity4 's @entity118 , the leader of the country 's @entity120 community , issued a fatwa against civil marriage in january but @entity6 says that the pair were expecting their union to spark outrage in some quarters			1
in love : as @entity8 , the pair could have legally married in @entity4 , but decided to take a stand against the country 's laws by entering a civil union she said : ' civil marriage threatens the politicians , because once sectarianism is broken , this means we wo n't be following them blindly by our sects , we will be following our loyalty to the country			1
' the newlyweds hope that other couples will follow their lead but they currently have no legal backing governing civil marriage			0
according to family lawyer @entity147 , two @entity8 who wed would be subject to @entity148			0
the lawyer said that it is difficult to see the law changing in the near future			0
but for couples from different religions , civil unions have no legal grounding			0
previous attempts to legalise civil marriage in the 1950s and in 1998 have failed .			0

@entity6 and @entity7 wed last november in @entity60
they kept the wedding a secret while waiting for government documents
but when they had n't arrived , the pair decided to take their union public
their partnership has sparked fierce debate on @entity4 marriage laws
