by @entity0 @entity1 have sounded out @entity2 about a possible move to @entity4 ’s – with @entity5 so far reluctant to grant the @entity6 his dream switch to @entity8			1
@entity2 , the former @entity9 and @entity10 manager , last week told @entity11 of his desire to succeed @entity13 in the hot seat in @entity8 ’s @entity15			1
@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 have also been linked with the @entity5 post together with @entity21 , whose representatives were asked earlier in the week if the job would be of interest him			1
up for the job : @entity2 , who left @entity10 after narrowly missing out on promotion , has put his name forward for the @entity5 role @entity29 is also in the running for the job and bookmakers yesterday were cutting the odds on the fomer @entity35 captain			1
@entity5 ’s problem in recruiting @entity13 ’s successor appears to be the reluctance of some potential candidates to show their hand – with the current vacancies at @entity1 and @entity42 muddying the waters			1
the south coast club are now compiling a shortlist for the successor to @entity49 - bound @entity48 and last night they broke cover to ask @entity51 midfielder @entity2 if he would be interested in talking to them			2
it ’s believed , however , that @entity2 ’s preference would be a crack at the @entity56 with @entity5			1
@entity21 and @entity16 are also thought to be on @entity1 ’ chairman @entity58 ’s short - list together with @entity13 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
@entity2 , who resigned from @entity10 after missing out in the semi-finals of the @entity66 play - offs , is also attracting interest from @entity68			1
double act : will @entity21 ( left ) be united with @entity70 at @entity5 ? @entity21 has an offer from @entity72 but has so far not committed			2
@entity29 ’s link to the managerial vacancy at @entity5 surfaced again last night following a flurry of bets placed on the @entity78 assistant manager			2
the odds on @entity29 being appointed as the next @entity5 supremo were dramatically slashed from 33/1 to even money – one firm , @entity82 , went 8/11			2
while betting indicators are not always reliable , @entity11 understands that @entity29 is firmly on the radar of the @entity86 hierarchy			0
@entity88 manager @entity87 has predicted @entity29 will return to front - line club management and has stated he would not stand in his way should his right - hand man express a desire to move on			0
@entity29 is due to speak to the media at the @entity94 later today ahead of saturday ’s friendly against @entity96 at @entity95			0
it ’s likely one item will dominate the agenda			0
winning pedigree : @entity21 won the @entity101 with @entity102 in 2013 earlier this week , @entity29 spoke of his admiration for @entity5 , for whom he played half a season for at the end of his career , but declined to push himself forward as a candidate			0
‘ they are a brilliant club , an absolutely fantastic football club , one of the best in the world			0
but i have got a job , ’ he said			0
since becoming @entity78 assistant manager , @entity29 has been linked with jobs at @entity116 , @entity117 , as an assistant to @entity119 at @entity120 , and now @entity5			2
his profile has also risen with his @entity123 work where his presence guarantees high ratings			0
@entity5 ’s major shareholder , @entity127 , is a close friend of @entity87 and has direct access to discussing @entity29 ’s suitability for the @entity5 job , if required			1
the @entity132 refused to comment on the rising speculation			0
new man in charge : @entity48 has been named as the new manager of @entity49			0

@entity1 keen on recruiting former @entity10 boss @entity2
@entity2 wants @entity5 job but the club have not yet offered him a role
