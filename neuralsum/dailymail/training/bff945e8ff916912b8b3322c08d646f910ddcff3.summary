the @entity13 has a history of being opposed to measure b and gives the reason that actors are tested for @entity24 every 14 days			0
wrap it up : after a law that requires porn actors to wear condoms passed in @entity8 , many producers have been looking to shoot porns in neighboring towns @entity1 does n't require that actors get tested , and therefore could put them at risk for disease			1
measure b was enforced by the @entity37 @entity36 ( @entity38 ) to ensure the safety of porn actors			1
unfortunately , less people want to watch porns with actors wearing condoms			1
porn actress @entity44 told @entity45 , i would n't mind using condoms more			2
it 's just not what people want to see			0
' if people do n't want to see it , they wont pay for it			0
people are still filing porn permits , but they 're doing it in neighboring towns			2
@entity59 @entity58 in the @entity60 : @entity8 porn actors must wear condoms during porn shoots in the area ' most production companies have ceased shooting in @entity8			1
they have other options in other states and communities , ' said @entity14 to @entity71			0
the neighboring city of @entity73 issued a 45 - day moratorium on porn productions because a a growing number of requests to shoot in the area caused concern for city officials			2
@entity73 does n't have a condom rule so officials called the moratorium to ' study it so we can craft certain regulations , ' said assistant city attorney @entity85			0
