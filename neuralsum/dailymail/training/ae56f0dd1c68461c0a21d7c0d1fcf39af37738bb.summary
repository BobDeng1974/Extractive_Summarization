@entity3 leader @entity2 must face international justice for human rights abuses committed by the state that are comparable to atrocities committed in the @entity9 era , a @entity1 investigator said today			1
@entity10 , the @entity1 special rapporteur on human rights in @entity3 , said there was enough evidence of systematic torture , starvation and killings , to hold the isolated country 's leader accountable			1
a @entity1 inquiry concluded in a february 17 report that @entity3 security chiefs and possibly even @entity2 himself should face international justice for ordering ' massive ' human rights atrocities - including torture and starvation			1
' and therefore it 's only now that we are in the position to in fact directly put culpability on the supreme leader for these massive human rights violations			2
' a resolution drafted by the @entity54 and @entity55 has urged @entity3 's referral to the @entity57 for crimes against humanity - but it does not single @entity2 out by name			1
@entity3 has dismissed the @entity1 inquiry as part of an @entity64 plot aimed at destroying the country 's political system			1
in recent months , the country 's diplomats have also been on a vigorous campaign to counter the moves to drag @entity3 to the @entity57			2
mr @entity10 added : ' that , perhaps , has somewhat agitated the @entity3 delegation			0
' the draft resolution could go to a @entity1 general assembly committee that deals with human rights as early as next week			1
a photo released by the country 's tightly - controlled media outlets shows a battalion of troops in @entity80 if approved , it will be put to a vote at the @entity83 in december			0
only the 15 - member @entity84 can refer the situation in @entity3 to the @entity57 , but diplomats say @entity87 , @entity3 's main benefactor , would likely veto such a move			2
recently , it was reported that @entity2 had ordered one of his top military officials be shot by firing squad for changing the words of a socialist anthem when singing karaoke			0
he was said to be furious after learning the man had changed the lines ' thanks to our party ' to ' thanks to your party ' and ' hate your enemies , love your country , ' to ' hate your wife , love your mistress '			0
the move was considered a sign of a rebellious spirit and the man was dragged out of his home and put to death by firing squad the next day			0
it was also revealed that other former military leaders had suffered death by firing squad after they were caught watching @entity121 soap operas .			0
