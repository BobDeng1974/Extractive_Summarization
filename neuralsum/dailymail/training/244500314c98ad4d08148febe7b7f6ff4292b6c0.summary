shadow chancellor @entity2 ’s whizzkid younger brother has received a huge @entity5 bonus of about £ 4.5 million			1
@entity6 , a senior executive at bond traders @entity8 , is being feted as one of the @entity5 ’s fastest - rising stars since being promoted to deputy chief investment officer last month			1
and the latest published figures reveal the scale of his rewards			0
while his combined annual salary and bonus generally tops £ 1 million , @entity6 was one of seven @entity8 directors to share a bonus pot of £ 57 million in 2012			1
the @entity3 's brother @entity6 , a senior executive at bond traders @entity8 , is being feted as one of the @entity5 ’s fastest - rising stars since being promoted to deputy chief investment officer last month			1
the shadow chancellor – whose leader @entity23 has been highly critical of bankers ’ bonuses – will cost his brother dear if @entity27 win the next election			0
his soak - the - rich plan to raise the top rate of tax from 45p to 50p would cost @entity6 at least an extra £ 45,000 on his average annual earnings – and £ 225,000 more on the windfall			2
he would have paid around £ 2 million on his bonus under the current @entity36 regime			2
but under his big brother ’s proposal , he would have to pay about £ 2.25 million			2
@entity6 , who at 40 is six years @entity23 ’s junior , enjoys a lifestyle to go with his earnings : he takes holidays in the fashionable @entity42 outside @entity43 , has rented a home from @entity46 star @entity45 and recently bought a £ 6.5 million ‘ @entity50 ’ property in @entity49 ’s @entity48			1
to add insult to injury , @entity6 is also said to be a better football player than his brother ( above ) by contrast , big brother @entity23 has to make do with his £ 65,000 mp ’s salary and lives in a terrace house in @entity59 , @entity49 , with his wife and fellow shadow cabinet minister @entity61			1
just to rub it in , one friend of both brothers observed that @entity6 is also ‘ a better footballer ’ than his brother – or at least ‘ carries a bit less weight on the pitch ’			2
and he added pointedly : ‘ @entity6 is also a really nice bloke			1
’ the income gulf has , according to one of @entity6 ’s friends , led him to quip that he should be classified as ‘ the @entity72 ’s largest political donor ’ because of how much he is forced to ‘ help [ his ] brother out ’			0
the gulf has not always been so wide			0
the @entity6 brothers initially followed very similar paths			0
both were privately educated in @entity80 , went on to become academic stars at @entity82 and @entity83 , and then worked as economics writers at the @entity85			0
@entity86 , the former editor of the @entity85 , who worked with both brothers , has said : ‘ more than once i heard [ @entity6 ] referred to as @entity23 ’s clever brother			1
' he ’s a modest , cerebral guy , without the pointy elbows of his brother			0
’ mr @entity86 added that @entity6 ‘ always had a modest way of putting his views across ’ and was ‘ more interested in finding the truth about economics and markets ’			0
@entity23 switched to politics in the mid- 1990s and @entity6 went on to become one of the top earners now being targeted by the @entity3			2
@entity6 ’s rising profile in the @entity5 has caused political embarrassment for @entity100 in may 2010 , while @entity23 was in the @entity101 , @entity8 declared it had begun selling off @entity72 government debt – effectively a vote of no confidence in the government ’s economic policies			1
@entity6 was the company ’s head of @entity110 investment			0
one mutual friend said of the earnings gap last night : ‘ it ’s a bit galling for @entity114 are clever boys , and you could argue @entity23 has more power , but no one likes to be outstripped by their younger siblings			0

@entity6 is a senior executive at bond traders @entity8
now being feted as one of the @entity5 ’s fastest - rising stars
he was one of seven directors to share a bonus pot of £ 57 million in 2012
also said to be a better footballer than @entity23 and a ' really nice bloke '
