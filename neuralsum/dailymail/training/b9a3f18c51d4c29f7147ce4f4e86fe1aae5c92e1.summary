' we showed her the till receipt proving we had paid but she did not say sorry , or even say anything at all , and we left the supermarket			0
' by this time the team leader had arrived and confirmed i had paid			0
' upsetting : the 19 - year - old was confronted as he wheeled away his trolley having paid with cash he complained to the store afterwards and was given a £ 5 gift voucher but said said the amount was an insult for the allegation that he was a thief			1
