the images had been uploaded to @entity70 , an online storage system available to all @entity73 users which synchronises with iphones and @entity75			2
it is thought many of the victims would have had their photos uploaded automatically without realising they had allowed the process to happen through their devices ' security settings			0
users ' @entity70 accounts are private , but hackers found a vulnerability in one of the site 's login pages which allowed them to enter multiple passwords until they cracked users ' details			1
@entity73 quickly fixed the glitch , but by then the damage had been done			0
today it emerged 100,000 more videos and images have been leaked online after they were intercepted from @entity97 ( above )			2
the pictures are feared to contain a large cache of child pornography , as half of the app 's users are aged between 13 and 17			0
images sent using the app are designed to disappear after they have been viewed once , but recipients can take screenshots of the pictures and forward them to other people			0
he strongly denies that he was responsible for the hacking , as did his pole - dancing wife @entity31 , 25 , who said the pictures were all taken ' from open sources '			2
she admitted on her social network that her husband 's exposure had been salutary after the story about the website , featuring naked pictures of stars , was taken up by by the @entity123 media			1
' in @entity7 this story was broadcast on all the channels and all the media wrote about it			2
in one day our life turned to something like hell , ' she complained , not mentioning the angst for celebrities whose private pictures were featured by her husband without their permission			0
but she admitted the couple may avoid travelling to the @entity137 where her husband could be at risk of prosecution			0
' we should probably only go on holidays to @entity141 now , ' she said			0
@entity142 star @entity4 , 24 , called the publication of pictures ' a sex crime , a sexual violation '			0
@entity43 , 34 , complained of ' a sex crime and a complete invasion of privacy			0
' @entity15 initially claimed that the site belonged to a mystery @entity7 living in @entity153 but later admitted he collected thousands of hacked images and videos after they were posted on various web sources			1
' the first pictures appeared on the internet on august 31 and i decided to make a website and to carry out an experiment if people were interested in such photographs			0
' and it turned out they were very much interested			0
i posted the pictures to the website and it quickly became popular			0
' he alleged stars sent him their pictures to be included on his site - which we are not naming			2
asked who volunteered their naked images , he said : ' i do not remember the names of those celebrities			0
' he also complained to the @entity7 media that he had been found by @entity181 journalists even though ' all my personal details were closed '			2
in fact they were not , since he had openly registered his name as a website owner and registered the address of his mother - who works in a jewellery shop - in @entity190 , a @entity7 city best known as the home of @entity193 cars			1
he did not appear to give the same privacy concerns to the women whose pictures he uploaded , after they were stolen from @entity73 's @entity70			2
he said his site is now ' living its own life ' and he was no longer promoting it			2
earlier he alleged that many of the stars got ' good publicity ' from the exposure			1
speaking out : the actress @entity4 said of the leak : ' it 's disgusting			0
the law needs to be changed '			0
