a @entity1 mushroom could hold the key to killing the virus that causes cervical cancer			1
the human papilloma virus ( @entity6 ) is a common , and highly contagious , infection that affects skin and the moist membrane linings of the body , for example , in the cervix , mouth and throat			1
more than three quarters of all women acquire the virus during their lives and some strains can cause cervical cancer			2
@entity1 shiitake mushrooms contain a unique chemical called @entity23 , which may help boost the immune system and block tumour growth but new @entity27 research has found an extract found in shiitake mushrooms may play a role in preventing @entity6 - related cancers			1
@entity6 is spread via sexual contact and causes cervical cancer in women as well as cancer of the throat , anus and penis			1
shiitake mushrooms , which have been used medicinally in their native @entity39 for centuries , they contain a unique chemical called active hexose correlated compound ( @entity23 ) , which is a mixture of amino acids , polysaccharides and minerals			1
currently , there is no effective medicine or supplement to treat @entity6 , which is associated with more than 99 percent of cervical cancer cases			2
in the new study , 10 women with the hpv virus were given an extract of the mushroom , once a day for six months			2
of those , five were successfully treated and the pilot clinical trial is now being extended to include a larger number of patients			0
professor @entity62 , of the @entity63 , said : ' the results are very encouraging			0
' we were able to determine at least three months of treatment is necessary but some need to extend that to six months			0
' since @entity23 is a nutritional supplement with no side effects and other immune modulating benefits , we will be planning on using six months of treatment in our phase two clinical study to have consistent study treatment plan			0
' previous research has shown @entity23 boosts the immune system by increasing the number of cells which help the body fight off infections and block tumour growth			1
the human papilloma virus ( @entity6 ) is a common , and highly contagious , infection which can cause cervical cancer			1
currently , there is no effective medicine or supplement to treat @entity6 professor @entity62 presented her results at an @entity90 in @entity91			0
it is understood that while the results were seen in women , @entity23 will have the same result on men			2
it may also be capable of treating genital warts in men			0
earlier this year , she reported that in mice , @entity23 led to the eradication of @entity6 within 90 days			1
it also decreased the rate of cervical tumour growth			2
@entity23 works as an immunotherapy , which is a treatment that uses a body 's own immune system to help fight disease			0
dr @entity62 said : ' @entity23 is a common , well tolerated nutritional supplement that has been used for decades in @entity110			0
' i am very excited to be pursuing a nutritional approach to trying to find a treatment for hpv infections			0

extract found in shiitake mushrooms may help prevent @entity6 - related cancers
@entity6 is a contagious infection that affects skin , cervix , mouth and throat
shiitake mushrooms contain chemical @entity23 which may boost immunity
*5/10* women given extract were succesfully treated for cervical cancer
previous research shows @entity23 can help block tumour growth
in mice , @entity23 led to the eradication of @entity6 within 90 days
