by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson ok , so it was n’t quite the tower block being detonated : @entity3 went down fighting , a post 's width from equalising in injury time and ultimately only second - best because of @entity10 ’s brilliance			1
but the @entity11 represented their most realistic chance to win a trophy this season and a trophyless campaign means heads will roll			0
@entity17 appears to have already decided his time at the club will come to an end at the end of the season			0
he was criticised when @entity3 were winning so he knew what was coming as soon as they started losing			2
scroll down to watch @entity25 appearing exhausted in training before @entity11 final up in arms : @entity25 reacts during @entity3 's @entity11 final defeat against @entity30 teapot : the @entity33 superstar puts his hands on his hips as he faces up to a toothless display pals and rivals : @entity39 ( right ) comforts @entity25 after the game rubbing it in : @entity30 playmaker @entity42 celebrates as @entity25 reflects on his poor performance ca n't hold him off : @entity25 keeps @entity10 at arm 's length , but it was the former @entity47 star who had the last laugh no comfort : @entity51 puts his arm round @entity25 after the defeat against @entity3 's arch rivals @entity10 hailed in @entity55 as ' run of a lifetime ' from fresh - faced youngster to global star - the changing face of @entity10 step - by - step guide to @entity10 's wonder goal @entity63 claims @entity10 ' now a superstar ' as @entity65 savours perfect night @entity66 hails @entity10 as ' extraordinary ' ' it ’s been a hard week , ' he said after the @entity30 defeat			1
his side are now out of two competitions and almost out of a third inside seven days			0
@entity17 rotated his squad earlier in the season so that they might not tire in the later big games - as they did so disastrously last year against @entity75 in the @entity77 semi-final - but there is no accounting for @entity10			1
' it ’s incredible to see at that stage of the game someone with the power to make that run and then the composure to finish as he did , ' said the @entity3 coach of his tormentor			2
if , as expected , @entity17 goes , two candidates will lead the race to replace him			2
@entity93 's @entity92 appeals to the @entity3 media because of his swashbuckling football and charismatic press conferences			1
but @entity98 coach @entity97 might be a more realistic option and would be many fans ' choice			0
@entity102 - @entity10 ! the @entity104 star ( centre ) scored a sensational winning goal to land the cup for @entity30 money well spent : the world 's most expensive footballer at £ 86m has won his new side a trophy already @entity97 will also be a safer bet			1
as a former player at the @entity115 he will not look to compromise the ' @entity3 way ' and will not complain if the club ca n't make any signings this summer - he is in much the same position at @entity120 , who can only sign @entity123 players			1
if president @entity124 comes up with an acceptable candidate to replace @entity17 then he may save his own skin			1
but if supporters are unhappy at the prospective new manager then attention will turn to a board still marked by its association to @entity132 , the last president who oversaw the @entity51 contract fiasco and failed to satisfy @entity135 's demands for @entity3 to put the status of their under 18 players in order			0
the ban on transfers will perhaps save the squad from a major overhaul although any big offers for players such as @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 may be accepted regardless			0
time to go : @entity3 boss @entity17 ( left ) knows his days are numbered at the @entity115 going , going , gone ? @entity145 , who has been a star at right back for @entity3 , could be leaving this summer the club are still hopeful they can buy time in the transfer market by appealing to the @entity152 in @entity153 , freeing them up to spend at the end of this season before any ban kicks in next winter if they lose the appeal			1
what ca n't be bought is the happiness and form of @entity25			0
' @entity164 in action ' was the most used headline after his no - show in the final			0
the slalom dribbles have been replaced by a melancholic meandering and there is a sense that until the old @entity25 returns @entity3 will struggle to emerge from the doldrums .			2

@entity25 's lack of form criticised after @entity11 final
@entity3 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity30 in @entity179
@entity3 boss @entity17 is expected to leave in the summer
@entity93 coach @entity92 is the favourite to replace @entity17
@entity120 's @entity97 is the other candidate
@entity3 face a transfer ban in the summer , meaning no squad overhaul
