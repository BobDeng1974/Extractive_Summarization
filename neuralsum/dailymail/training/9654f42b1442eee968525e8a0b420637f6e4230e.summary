the promising 21 - year - old had to have a chunk of her skull removed to heal a dangerous blood clot in her brain , but now she has made a remarkable recovery and has been attending classes at @entity12 again			1
five other students were injured - but none so badly as @entity9 , who was discovered at the scene by classmate @entity29 breathing in a way ' where it 's like you 're on the verge of dying '			1
rather than returning home to @entity48 a few days later as she had planned , the business major was confined to a hospital bed in @entity6			1
she had a fractured skull and blood clots in the brain , causing doctors to remove part of her skull to relieve the swelling			2
hospital : @entity9 slipped into a coma after the minivan driven by a classmate rolled over on the road damage : the popular student had part of her brain removed and replaced with a plastic implant care : @entity9 's mother @entity68 helps her navigate the stairs in their home in @entity71 , @entity48 her parents @entity72 and @entity68 - who later said they did not blame mr @entity33 for the crash , because ' that could have been any one of our kids at the wheel ' - flew across the world to be at her side			1
it took a month before @entity9 smiled again , and at that time she was still confined to hospital in @entity84			2
her flowing hair brunette hair had been cut short and she was made to wear a hockey helmet to protect her brain where the skull had been cut out			0

agony : the student had to wear a hockey helmet for months to protect her brain from further damage rehab : a therapist worked with @entity9 in the months after the accident to help her walk again in early august , she was allowed to return home , to a house in the town of @entity71 which had been specially kitted out to take account of her condition			2
with the help of extra bannisters and railings and a modified bathroom , she started to be able to take care of herself - but she still needed her parents to drive her in to @entity84 twice a week for therapy			0
@entity9 started seeing other people again around this time , but was humiliated by having to wear her helmet and told two friends : ' sorry you have to see me like this			0
' she was still plagued by her injuries - and doctors said the damage to her brain had caused her to overestimate the pace of her own recovery			0
but in september , on the first day of the new academic year , she finally had her skull repaired , with surgeons inserting a custom - made piece of plastic where the bone had been cut away			0
prep : meg with a nurse before the operation to repair her skull last september surgery : surgeons , nurses and anaestheologists laying @entity9 out on the operating table procedure : the operating table at @entity142 during @entity9 's surgery she was keen to return to college following the operation , but her therapist advised her to attend community college or audit a @entity12 class instead			1

' not great , not phenomenal			0

she has reunited with mr @entity33 , who was banned from the road for six months after pleading guilty to careless driving			0
and she has also seen mr @entity29 , who has suffered flashbacks since the accident but said that having @entity9 back at @entity12 would help heal the mental scars			1
