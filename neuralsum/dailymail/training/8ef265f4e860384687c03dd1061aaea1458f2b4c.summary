by @entity0 for the @entity1 they simply wanted to smarten up their local area , and were happy to give up their own time to do it			0
but one group of neighbours faced an unexpected obstacle as they prepared to take up litter - pickers and clean up their street … the local council			1
it informed the residents that under health and safety legislation , it had no choice but to order them to down tools because they had not been trained to use them			0
@entity18 , member of @entity19 , with equipment supplied by @entity21 yesterday the volunteers – part of a network backed by none other than the local council – said they were ‘ stunned ’ by the demand			1
@entity28 , who was among those planning to help spruce up @entity30 in the @entity32 area of @entity21 , said : ‘ we have been collecting litter for a number of years and were issued with a small amount of litter - pickers to support us doing this			1
‘ why are we now being told we can not use them without training – why now ? ‘ we were told it is because the litter - pickers were issued by the council			1
’ she pointed out that she and her fellow residents – members of @entity19 , backed by @entity21 – were still expected to use wheelie bins , also issued by the council			1
‘ does this mean that all the residents in @entity49 should undergo moving and handling training to avoid personal injury ? ’ she added			2
‘ we have worked very hard trying to empower people into taking responsibility to pick up litter in front of their own properties			2
this action can have the opposing effect			0
’ @entity60 , another volunteer , said : ‘ i feel that the council is doing everything it can to deter us from carrying on as a group but it is not going to stop us			1
’ they were backed by @entity65 , another resident , who said he was ‘ stunned ’			0
he added : ‘ as a community group , we act responsibly at all times around waste on the street because of the known risks			0
‘ so , to learn after carrying out regular litter picks safely for so many months that training was now required came as a shock			2
‘ i am fearful that such an approach will put off concerned members of the public looking to take pride in their community by looking to collect litter from the street if the council puts in place such requirements			2
we should be looking to empower people to care for their community , not place hurdles in their way			0
’ and fellow volunteer @entity87 said : ‘ it has come as a great blow and a shame to hear that the council is stopping dedicated volunteers within the community taking pride within their area , spending hours of their time litter - picking			1
’ @entity97 , @entity21 ’s strategic director for neighbourhoods , said the authority wanted people to help keep their streets clean but there were dangers and it was legally obliged to train them if they were using council equipment			1
he added : ‘ we absolutely want to encourage people to pick up litter and to take pride in their locality			0
the volunteers were cleaning @entity30 in @entity32 , @entity21 , when they were told to stop by the council ‘ under the @entity109 , we have a duty of care on people undertaking work on our behalf			1
‘ where we are asked by people to work on our behalf , we have to satisfy ourselves that they understand the risks and what they are going to be doing			0
‘ with litter , there could be needles in what they pick up or large items could be heavy			0
’ mr @entity97 added : ‘ if anything were to go wrong , we could potentially be sued as we ’ve sanctioned that work			0
’ the council is understood to have let the team hold on to the litter - pickers until they can be trained in how to use them properly			2
in the year to march , there were 6,651 incidents of fly - tipping in @entity21 , including 5,173 in the @entity32 and @entity133 wards , but no convictions .			1

volunteers cleaning the streets in @entity32 , @entity21 , were ordered to stop
they had been issued with a small number of litter pickers by the council
but @entity21 said they could not continue as they had no training
volunteer @entity28 said they have been collecting litter for years
