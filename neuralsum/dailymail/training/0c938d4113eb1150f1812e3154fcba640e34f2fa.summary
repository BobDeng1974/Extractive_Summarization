the startup 's system includes an app , alongside a series of physical alarms that sound emergency tones as soon as possible , before the shaking reaches that particular location in the past 30 days , more than 1,400 earthquakes have struck globally - and at least 160 of them have rocked the @entity10 across @entity11 and the west coast			1
the @entity10 government is working with a number of experts to develop an early warning system to give residents a heads up about such natural disasters as quickly as possible			2
and one firm , called @entity21 , is developing a service called @entity23 that monitors quakes and shaking using a smartphone app. the @entity27 - based startup 's system includes an app , alongside a series of in - home or office alarms that sound an emergency tone as soon as possible , before the shaking reaches that particular location			1
the system also plays a countdown to warn the homeowner , or office worker , when the shaking will reach them , and reveals how intense it will be - ranging from light to severe			1
additionally , the app includes tips on what to do if the user is indoors , outdoors , or in a moving vehicle			0
the app works as a standalone product , meaning that if an earthquake hits while a user is out of the house or office , they are still sent a warning			1
it does this using the phone ’s in - built sensors			1
the firm developed the technology in partnership with mapping provider @entity58 , as well as the @entity60			0
its mission is to ‘ improve , expand , and lower the costs of the existing earthquake early warning systems			0
’ the work is part of a larger project set up by the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) to develop an earthquake early warning system ( @entity71 ) for the country - dubbed @entity72			1
@entity21 is developing a system called @entity23 that monitors quakes and shaking using a smartphone app and sensors built into physical alarms			1
it is hoped it will reduce the amount of damage caused by natural disasters in the @entity10			0
the aftermath of the 1994 @entity84 earthquake is pictured a demonstration earthquake early warning system called @entity86 began sending test notifications to selected users in january 2012			1
but , @entity21 said the system needs to be further tested , and additional funding is needed to complete the final research and development of the system			2
the point of an earthquake early warning system is to ‘ rapidly detect the initiation of an earthquake , estimate the level of ground shaking intensity to be expected , and issue a warning before significant ground shaking starts ’ explained @entity105			2
a network of seismic sensors detect the first energy to radiate from an earthquake , known as the p - wave energy , as well as the location and the magnitude of the earthquake			1
then , the system estimates how far and wide the ground shaking will spread			0
the system provides a second warning before the so - called s - wave arrives , which brings the strong shaking that typically causes most of the damage			2
warnings are sent to local and state public emergency response officials , critical infrastructure , private businesses , and the public			0
@entity71 systems have already been successfully implemented in @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , and other nations with varying degrees of sophistication and coverage			0

and the @entity27 startup is hoping to develop and release the system over the next three years			1
it admits that , while the system may only provide a few seconds warning , depending on their distance from the centre , the system still gives people enough time to get to safety			0
the developers added that this also gives officials time to disable gas lines and manage transport links , for example			0
the app will be free , but the alarms are set to cost $ 100 ( £ 60 ) each .			1

there are two *options* available from @entity27 - based @entity21
its app detects signs of quakes when users are away from home or work
and its alarms can be fitted to *buildings* to warn homeowners or staff
sensors detects signs of a quake , which then triggers an emergency tone
a countdown tells users when the shaking will reach their location and warns them how severe it will be
startup is hoping to develop , test and release the product in three years
the app will be free , but the alarms are expected to cost $ 100 ( £ 60 each )
