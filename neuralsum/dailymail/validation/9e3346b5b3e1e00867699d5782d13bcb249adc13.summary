this is the man who spent two years touring the @entity2 in a quest to find the perfect pie			1
author @entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , had his fingers in a total of 314 pastries on his search for the best the country has to offer			1
the 41 - year - old judged each pie on a number of important criteria - purveyor , premises , purchase , place , pastry , presentation , package , palate , price , and portion - as part of his research for a book on @entity2 pies			1
the pie - mad author said : ' sometimes i go looking for the pie , sometimes the pie finds me			2
sometimes it 's a shop recommendation , sometimes i just hit a particular town or city and see what it has got to offer			0
' people , towns , cities and counties are proud of their pies and love to make and eat their own regional variations of them			0
' it was my staple diet for 700 days , although i was prepared to mix it up a bit in the interests of research			0
there were also pasties , chunky steak pies , breakfast items , and chicken and mushroom pies			0
' the crowning winner set him back Â£ 1.15 from @entity71 and @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity36 , and was awarded a heartwarming 61 points			1
@entity5 's book life of pies reviewing it , the father - of - one said : this is what i 've been searching for ! ' externally it does n't look at all spectacular but once i open it up i 'm left in awe as to how they pack it all in			1
' layer after layer of thick spud slice expanding like a concertina			0
it looks like one of those penny drops at the fairground where the chutes zig zag			0
' the 41 - year - old 's love of pies originates from his hometown - arguably the pie capital of the @entity2			1
' it is the duty of a @entity6 man to sample as many pies as is humanly possible from around the world , ' he said			0
' for many decades large swathes of professional and amateur commentators alike have laughed at the town of @entity6 and mocked its inhabitants for being pie eating simpletons			0
' nevertheless what i discovered during my research is that pies are not necessarily a @entity6 thing			2
they are a national treasure where each area has its individual intricacies and delicacies			0
' you know the way @entity129 parades around his @entity131 mansion in his dressing gown surrounded by a bevy of poolside beauties ? ' well that 's how i feel when you put pies in front of me through my eyes , there 's no ugly ones and each and every one of them deserves to be loved equally			2
' the @entity6 native crowned a humble meat and potato pie from a bakers in @entity36 as @entity2 's best and after years of practice in eating them , he has firm rules as to how they should be consumed			1
@entity5 said : ' a pie has to be completely encased for a start - otherwise there 's no chance of eating it with your hands , and the top crust should be the decorative invitation to the party that lies within			1
' oh and if that pastry falls apart , then so do i. with rage			0
' @entity5 has penned a book on finding the perfect pie - with in depth reviews of each and every one he has sunk his teeth into			1
