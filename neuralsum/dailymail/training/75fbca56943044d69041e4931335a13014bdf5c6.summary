by @entity1 reporter published : 12:41 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 : 12:41 est , 10 february 2014 an elderly man claims he has waited eight years to have a hernia operation on the @entity6			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , was first referred for surgery in 2006 but the 77 - year - old widower is still waiting for the operation to take place			1
he said : ‘ i know things are bad at @entity14 , but eight years ca n’t be right			2
@entity7 , 77 , says he has been waiting eight years for a hernia operation on the @entity6 ‘ my life is on hold			1
i ca n’t socialise , i ca n’t go out and have a little dance			2
’ mr @entity7 agrees that fate has also played a role in the long delay			1
at one stage he decided to go private but it snowed and the operation was cancelled			1
then he experienced more bad luck			2
‘ i agreed to go to @entity26 in @entity27 in 2011 but ended up in intensive care following an allergic reaction to an antibiotic so i still had the hernia , ’ he said			1
‘ then in october last year i went into @entity32 and they told me i was having the operation			1
i waited three hours and they sent me home			2
’ mr @entity7 , who says he has paid @entity38 all his working life , has even gone to his mp @entity40 about the situation			1
if left untreated some hernias can cause a bowel obstruction or cut off the blood supply to the affected tissue - both are medical emergencies			0
at one point , mr @entity7 was told he would have the operation at @entity32 ( pictured ) but he waited for three hours and was then sent home because there were no spare beds a spokesman for @entity54 said : ‘ mr @entity7 was due to have undergone surgery at @entity32 in october			1
‘ unfortunately we sometimes have to postpone non-urgent , pre-planned operations due to emergency patients needing urgent , unplanned care			2
‘ although @entity32 continues to be extremely busy , we are in contact with mr @entity7 to arrange an alternative date as soon as possible			1
‘ we offer our sincere apologies for any inconvenience and upset caused			0
’ a hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or tissue wall			0
they can occur anywhere in the abdomen and there are several different types			0
these include hernias where part of the bowel comes through the abdomen and into the groin - inguinal hernias - and hernias where tissue pokes through a surgical wound			0
inguinal hernias account for three in four cases			0
about one in four men and three in 100 women will have an inguinal hernia during their lifetime			0
hernias are more common in older people , those who are obese , those who do a lot of heavy lifting and those with a long - term cough			0
some hernias cause no problems while others can cause a bowel obstruction or interrupt the blood supply to the affected tissue - both of these situations are medical emergencies			0
some hernias need to be operated on - whether surgery is required depends on the location of the hernia and what symptoms it is causing			0

@entity7 was first referred for the operation in 2006
it has been cancelled because of snow , a *shortage* of beds and because he had an allergic reaction to antibiotics and ended up in intensive care
he is still waiting for it to take place and says his ' life is on hold '
