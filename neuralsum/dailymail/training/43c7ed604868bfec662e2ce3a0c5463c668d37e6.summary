by @entity0 once - teeming @entity2 marinas are idle as a 14 - year drought steadily drops water levels to historic lows			1
officials from nearby @entity7 are pushing conservation , but are also drilling a new pipeline to keep drawing water from the lake			1
hundreds of miles away , farmers who receive water from the lake behind @entity15 are preparing for the worst			1
the receding shoreline at one of the main reservoirs in the vast @entity20 water system is raising concerns about the future of a network serving a perennially parched region home to 40 million people and 4 million acres of farmland			1
right , how they appeared last week			2
@entity49 's largest man - made reservoir dropped below 1,082 feet above sea level marina operators , water managers and farmers who for decades have chased every drop of water across the booming @entity58 and part of @entity60 are closely tracking the reservoir water level already at its lowest point since it was first filled in the 1930s			1
' we just hope for snow and rain up in @entity20 , so it 'll come our way , ' said marina operator @entity68 , referring to precipitation in the @entity71 that flows down the @entity20 to help fill the reservoir separating @entity38 and @entity73			0
by 2016 , continued drought could trigger cuts in water deliveries to both states			2
while water authorities say they 've been saving water for potential dry days , the prospect of the first cuts is already prompting action			2
' i 've downsized in the last couple of years , probably a good thing the way this water shortage is going , ' said farmer @entity88 , who has planted just 225 of the 1,500 acres that are typically green this time of year on his farm south of @entity91			1
boats are moored at the @entity93 in 2007 ( top ) but in 2008 the marina was moved - and for good reason ! a buoy at what was once the @entity97 sits high and dry			0
the lack of rain has pushed most of @entity102 and @entity38 into extreme or exceptional drought a fish cleaning station is seen far from any water at the @entity37 in @entity38			1
the lake supplies water to parts of @entity38 , @entity73 , @entity102 and northern @entity60 , and the supply is disappearing ( @entity111 ) boats are moored at the @entity93 in 2007			1
( @entity112 ) a pair of rest rooms on pontoon floats rest on dirt in @entity117 where the marina was once located last week , officials announced an $ 11 million pilot program involving the federal government and water agencies in @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity7 and @entity91 to pay farmers , cities and industries to reduce river water use			1
' we can certainly hope for better conditions than we 've experienced in recent times , but we have to actively and continue to plan for the worst case , ' said @entity133 , director of the @entity73 @entity134			0
this week , an update from the federal @entity136 , the keeper of the @entity20 network 's dams and reservoirs , will help set the course for water deliveries for the next two years			2
administrators say they 're confident they can meet current commitments next year			2
federal officials and water administrators in metro areas such as @entity7 and @entity91 say they 're committed to finding new ways to make every drop of river water count — from cloud seeding to pipelines to new reservoirs to desalination plants			1
they point to agreements to leave surpluses unused in wet years , share pain in dry years and buy water designated for farms for city use			0
( @entity46 ) @entity93 is seen behind dry cracked earth in an area that was once filled with water			0
( @entity164 ) @entity2 is seen in the distance behind dry cracked earth in an area that used to be underwater at many lakes , now landlocked boat docks are upward hikes from the water the @entity173 @entity172 predicts some meat and produce prices will rise as much as 6 % as farmers pay more money to water crops and feed livestock @entity2 is seen in the distance behind boats in dry dock near the @entity93 in 2007 ( top ) but now things are even worse ( below ) but they 're all watching @entity2 , the biggest in a @entity20 basin that supplies water to @entity102 , @entity73 , @entity20 , @entity60 , @entity38 , @entity188 , @entity189 and part of @entity60			1
the states get annual allotments dating to the @entity193 of 1922			0
over the years , the amount has n't kept pace with a @entity197 development boom in the @entity58 , and pressure has increased with drought gripping the region for almost 15 years			0
the effect of increased demand and diminished supply is visible on @entity2 's canyon walls			1
a white mineral band often compared with a bathtub ring marks the depleted water level			2
the lake is expected to drop to 1,080 feet above sea level this year — down almost the width of a football field from a high of 1,225 feet in 1983			0
a projected level of 1,075 feet in january 2016 would trigger cuts in water deliveries to @entity73 and @entity38			0
at 1,000 feet , drinking water intakes would go dry to @entity7 , a city of 2 million residents and a destination for 40 million tourists per year that is almost completely dependent on the reservoir			1
that has the @entity222 spending more than $ 800 million to build a 20 - foot - diameter pipe so it can keep getting water			0
boats are moored at the @entity93 in 2007 ( top ) but in 2008 the marina was moved - and for good reason ! @entity229 , 13 , climbs on a boat at the @entity117 boat ramp			0
last week , @entity49 's largest man - made reservoir dropped below 1,082 feet above sea level , the lowest it 's been since the @entity15 was built in the 1930s @entity38 's @entity2 , the nation 's largest reservoir , has hit an all time - low since it was first filled in the 1930s , raising concerns that a water shortage could be declared for a region home to 40 million people in seven fast - growing states the dwindling supplies are easy to see in this comparison over just seven years			1
a 14 - year drought in the @entity58 and a dwindling supply of water from the @entity20 the region is also stressing water conservation , prohibiting grass lawns for new homes and fountains at businesses			1
officials say the overall effort has reduced consumption 33 percent in recent years while the @entity7 area added 400,000 residents			2
but severely restricting water use for swimming pools or lawns in a city like @entity91 would n't make much difference , said @entity265 , the city 's @entity266 director , because conservation efforts need to be applied across the western @entity173 ' the solution ca n't come just from municipal conservation ; there is n't enough water there , ' she said			1
if cuts do come , they 'll test the agreements forged in recent years between big , growing cities and farmers			0
in @entity102 , home to 38 million residents , farmers in the sparsely populated @entity280 in southeast @entity102 have senior water rights ensuring that they get water regardless of the condition			1
@entity286 , general manager of the @entity287 , defends his agency 's position at the head of the line and dismisses the idea that water should go to those who can pay the most or make the most compelling economic argument			0
the @entity296 has been forced to close or extend boat launch ramps , and move entire marinas to try to keep up with the receding water level what was once the @entity97 sits high and dry next to @entity2 @entity280 farmers grow some 200 crops , @entity302 said , from alfalfa to cotton and celery to zucchini			1
' there has to be a place in a diverse economy and a diverse @entity58 for a place like this that grows food and fiber year - round , ' he said			0
in @entity73 , reduced deliveries of @entity20 water would largely affect the @entity317 , which manages canals supplying 80 percent of the state 's population			2
a tiered system means farmers would face cuts first , shielding native american tribes and big cities			0
@entity88 , who owns @entity326 in @entity327 , @entity73 , worries about the future of farming in the region			0
tighter supplies mean there will be less farming and fewer dollars going to agricultural services like fertilizer suppliers			0
' eventually , ' he said , ' the prices are going to hit the consumer			2
sooner or later , it 's got to go up			0
so it 's just a domino effect			0

@entity102 drought having ramifications beyond the state
drought has depleted vast @entity2 this week to levels not seen since @entity15 was completed in the 1930s
experts say the water levels will be enough to supply water to places like @entity7 , @entity91 and @entity124 for only one more year
meat and produce prices are on the rise as a result
mandatory and *voluntary* conservation water programs being *implemented* in @entity362
tourism businesses also are taking a hit
