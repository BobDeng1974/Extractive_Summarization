by @entity0 follow @ @ charlieskillen @entity1 are embroiled in a bizarre pre-season row over the identity of an @entity5 side they thrashed 13 - 0			1
the @entity1 thought they were playing @entity8 side @entity7 , after an original match against @entity10 was cancelled			1
in fact the game was against a select xi from the @entity15 region comprised of non-professional players			0
' in our original match report for this warm - up fixture , acting in good faith on the basis of information given to the club , we incorrectly reported that we had played against local club side @entity22			2
' in fact the game was against an @entity15 regional select side and we are happy to put the record straight and apologise to @entity22 and their fans for the misunderstanding			0
preparation : the @entity1 are preparing for life back in the @entity42 under @entity17 this season following relegation from the @entity44 ' the game was convened at very short notice following the late cancellation of our previously scheduled match against @entity10			2
' the hospitality shown to @entity1 by the people in @entity52 and the surrounding area has been excellent and our training camp there has seen the squad continue to build their fitness levels , as we gear up for our three forthcoming friendlies against top - flight @entity60 opposition in the shape of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
' @entity1 proved much too strong for their opponents as @entity17 fielded a strong side to take on the locals as they eased to a 13 - 0 win at the @entity70 in @entity52			1
the wave of goals included braces for @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , plus further goals from @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 completed the rout .			0

forced to update the match report as 13 - 0 win was in fact against non-professionals from the local region
