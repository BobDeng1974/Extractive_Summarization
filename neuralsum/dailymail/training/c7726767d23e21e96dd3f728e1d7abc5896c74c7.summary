by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:18 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 09:28 est , 9 may 2013 fled : @entity2 called 911 seconds after she fled the @entity4 dungeon a @entity4 911 dispatch tape released on wednesday gives a revealing insight into how the situation unfolded for dispatchers and police after they received @entity2 ’s call for help			1
police were initially dispatched at 5:51pm on monday after a report of a 911 call from a female ‘ who says her named is @entity2 and that she had been kidnapped ten years ago			1
’ the dispatcher sent officers to 2210 @entity18 where @entity19 had said she fled after escaping her captor 's home at 2207 @entity18 , where she had been held captive for a decade			2
by 5:55 p.m. , police arrived at the scene and immediately recognized the seriousness of the situation			1
‘ this might be for real , ’ an officer can be heard saying			2
‘ @entity2 might be in this house also			2
’ then at about 5:59 p.m. , an officer confirmed what no one was expecting to happen			0
‘ we found ‘ em. we found ‘ em , ’ said the officer while cries from the women can be heard in the background			1
an officer then called for ambulances to respond to the scene , as one of the women was having trouble breathing			2
within a short period , @entity4 police confirmed they had located missing women @entity2 , @entity2 and @entity2 , as well as @entity19 ’s six - year - old daughter			1
all three were taken to the hospital			0
2207 @entity18 , @entity4 , where the three girls have been held captive for the past decade found : @entity2 ( right ) and @entity2 ( left ) were found alive in @entity4 on monday afternoon @entity4 officials have revealed they are reviewing the actions of the 911 dispatcher who took @entity2 ’s call seconds after she fled the @entity4 dungeon where she and two others had been held captive			1
the 911 dispatcher - one of the first people miss @entity2 spoke to after her decade long captivity - has been criticized for not comforting the distressed caller and not keeping the 26 - year - old on the phone until the police arrived			1
miss @entity2 's phone call on monday evening from a neighbor 's phone lasted less than two minutes			1
miss @entity2 , who disappeared in 2003 aged 14 , is heard screaming down the phone to an @entity65 police operator : ' i 've been kidnapped and i 've been missing for 10 years , and i 'm , i 'm here , i 'm free now			1
' but multiple times the dispatcher ’s response was ' talk to the police when they get there , ' before asking the name of miss @entity2 ’s captor , as well as his age and ethnicity			1
brothers : from left , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 have all been arrested in connection with the abduction of @entity2 , @entity2 and @entity2 almost ten years ago in the 911 call miss @entity2 implores the dispatcher that she needs the police immediately , but she is told authorities will be sent as soon as a ' car becomes open			1
' at one point when miss @entity2 says ' i 'm @entity2			2
i 've been on the news for the last 10 years , ' the dispatcher replies ' i got that , dear			2
' in the recording the emotional cries from @entity92 and @entity2 can be heard			1
as miss @entity2 becomes more frantic the dispatcher says ' the police are on their way ; talk to them when they get there			1
' the dispatcher , whose identity has not been revealed , repeats again ' i told you they 're on their way ; talk to them when they get there , ok			0
' combing : @entity4 police and @entity107 agents search a yard			0
there were apparently signs that dirt had recently been moved in the backyard of the house ' one of the things that jumped out was that after the dispatch took the information , she moved on to the next call			0
i think that realizing the gravity of the situation , the dispatch might have stayed on the call with that person , ' @entity125 , a dispatcher for 20 years in @entity126 , @entity119 told the @entity127			2
' you generally want to hold the person on the phone and try to make a personal connection until law enforcement can get there			0
' @entity134 played the full 9 - 1 - 1 call for @entity136 and training officer @entity137 , who admitted she would have kept miss @entity2 on the phone			1
' in this call , she was afraid that the man who had her was coming back			0
if i had kept her on the phone , and he came back , we could have alerted officers , ' ms @entity137 said			0
in response @entity146 director @entity145 said police were dispatched and on scene in the west side neighborhood in less than two minutes			0
this map shows the block , @entity152 , in @entity4 where the three girls went missing , years apart			2
they were found monday on @entity18 , approximately three miles from where they were abducted ' while the call - taker complied with policies and procedures which enabled a very fast response by police , we have noted some concerns which will be the focus of our review , including the call - taker ’s failure to remain on the line with ms. @entity2 until police arrived on scene			1
' please be assured that this matter will be investigated , and if necessary , appropriate corrective action taken			0
' i would like to note that the call - taker did take the call , create an event and send it to the channel dispatcher in less than 90 seconds			2
within 1 minutes and 18 seconds from the time that the call - taker answered the call our dispatcher was broadcasting the assignment to available police units			1
' as a result of the call - taker ’s actions , police were dispatched and on scene in less than two minutes			2
