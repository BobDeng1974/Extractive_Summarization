two points dropped at home to relegation threatened @entity3 and midfield keystone @entity4 banned for three games and , surprise , surprise , it is all down to the decisions which went against @entity10			1
' minute 30 , minute 33 , minute 43 and minute 69 , ' was pretty much all @entity11 wanted to say after the game , pointing everyone towards incidents which might have twice produced a red card for @entity16 and twice earned the home team a penalty			1
@entity16 was certainly fortunate to get away with the tackle on @entity4 , which sparked a retaliatory shove which earned the @entity22 a red card which will rule him out of the @entity26 final and @entity28 games against @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity31 rises above the @entity10 defence to equalise for @entity3 against @entity28 leaders @entity10 at @entity34 @entity10 goalkeeper @entity35 can only watch in vain as @entity38 's header beats the @entity40 international @entity38 wheels away in celebration after finding the target with a header to level proceedings at @entity34 with 10 minutes left @entity11 tried to keep it cryptic at his post-match press conference , but you did n’t need to be a super sleuth to work out the four incidents that had so enraged the @entity10 manager			1
so let us enlighten you on the flashpoints ... 30 minutes — @entity16 sends @entity56 crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back			1
@entity56 rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken			0
verdict : should have been a free - kick and could have been a yellow card			0
33 minutes — @entity56 fires a shot at goal but @entity67 diverts it with an outstretched arm , as he turns his back to goal			1
verdict : should have been a @entity10 penalty			0
43 minutes — @entity74 tumbles to the ground after @entity3 captain @entity76 leans into him with an oustretched arm			2
verdict : could have been a @entity10 penalty but would have been very soft			0
69 minutes — @entity16 misses the ball and almost snaps @entity4 ’s left shin with his studs but @entity72 waves play on			1
an enraged @entity4 leaps up and pushes @entity16 over violently			2
@entity72 sends off @entity4 and books @entity56 for trying to take red card out of his hand			1
verdict : shocking tackle merited a red card for @entity16 and a @entity10 free - kick			1
with his side leading the @entity10 midfielder is given his marching orders from referee @entity72 in the 70th minute of the match @entity16 also got away with a first - half challenge on the airborne @entity56 , which might have been punished but was n't with anything more than a free - kick to @entity10			1
the penalty claims might have gone @entity11 's way on another day but still his team must shoulder the blame			1
they can not hide behind the campaign imagined by their manager			0
@entity10 were rattled by the loss of @entity4 , 11 minutes from time , and appeared to be still seething at the injustice of it all when @entity16 was allowed to turn , in @entity4 territory , on the edge of the penalty area , and unleash a low drive which was turned wide by @entity35			1
from the corner , taken as @entity112 was prepared to come on as a substitute , @entity31 climbed above @entity115 to head @entity117 's cross into the net and equalise			2
if the referee lost his focus and made mistakes , then so did @entity11 's players			1
@entity112 returned to the bench and @entity124 came on instead			0
the flash of temper from @entity4 was most out of character and understandable when you see replays of the high challenge by @entity16 , well above the ankle , but he must know you can not react by sprinting 10 yards and throwing him to the floor			1
@entity56 , still aggrieved from his skirmish with @entity16 , could not help getting involved and was booked for trying to stop @entity72 brandishing his red card			1
@entity10 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity35 6 ; @entity56 6.5 , @entity137 6 , @entity138 6.5 , @entity139 6 ( @entity124 85 ) ; @entity140 5.5 , @entity4 6 ; @entity141 6.5 ( @entity142 63 , 5 ) , @entity143 5 ( @entity115 72 , 6 ) , hazard 8 ; costa 5 subs not used : @entity145 , @entity115 , @entity146 , @entity112 , @entity147 scorer : @entity56 14 booked : @entity56 sent off : @entity4 manager : @entity11 6 @entity3 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity150 7 ; @entity117 6.5 , @entity76 6.5 , @entity151 6 , @entity38 7 ; @entity152 5 , @entity153 6.5 , @entity154 7 , @entity67 6 ( @entity155 79 ) ; @entity16 6 , @entity156 5.5			1

@entity35 smashes his hand against the crossbar in frustration after @entity10 throw away their lead against @entity3 @entity4 reacts to a challenge from @entity16 which earns him a straight red card in the 70th minute @entity138 seemed to be the coolest head			1
if there were others , @entity10 might have defended their 1 - 0 lead and would not be lamenting @entity3 's fighting spirit and two lost points			1
and to think it had all started so well for @entity187			0
five days after his vital ' away goal ' in @entity189 , @entity56 struck with a goal made by @entity168 , and featuring @entity191 , the @entity193 making only his second start but who seems to have struck an instant chemistry with those around him			0
@entity141 forced an early save from @entity150 with a header and his pass launched hazard into the penalty box , where the @entity202 jinked to his right , skipped past three defenders , had the vision to spot @entity56 and cut a cross short to his feet			0
@entity4 is given his marching orders by referee @entity72 and is now set to miss the @entity26 final against @entity210 @entity138 and @entity137 restrain a furious @entity4 after he shown the red card for reacting to @entity16 ' horror tackle perhaps @entity11 's complaints about the @entity214 has been enduring had an effect on @entity3 's defenders as they failed to get close to him			1
@entity56 tucked the chance away at the near post , his third goal of the month , his sixth of the season and his 31st for the club			0
not bad for a defender , although there have been times this season when the thundering right - back is more of an attacker			0
he was on the rampage once again before half - time to unleash a fierce drive which crashed into @entity67 's arm as the @entity3 winger turned his back on the ball			2
this was the first of @entity11 's phantom penalties			1
on another day it would have been given			0
@entity67 's arm was extended away from his body and the ball had travelled some distance towards him , albeit at incredible speed			0
@entity56 was unimpressed , especially as this was only three minutes after he had been booted from behind by @entity16			2
the other phantom penalty came two minutes before half - time when @entity76 seemed to give @entity74 a nudge from behind as the striker wriggled free			0
@entity74 exaggerated his tumble to the turf and was appalled when referee @entity72 played on			0
@entity56 turns the ball past @entity3 goalkeeper @entity150 to give @entity10 the lead at @entity34 @entity74 and @entity72 have history from the first leg of the @entity26 semi-final at @entity256			1
@entity150 saved from @entity143 soon after conceding , but the visitors readjusted and there were flashes of encouragement for @entity166 before half - time , underlining how far his team have come since they were swept away by @entity10 at @entity263 on the opening day of the campaign			0
@entity16 caught a volley sweetly from the edge of the penalty box but it was too near the goalkeeper , @entity76 headed over when free at a corner			0
@entity35 beat away a deflected effort from @entity16 after the break , but @entity10 slowly regained control , creating a cluster of second - half chances with @entity168 influential			2
matic almost smuggled in a second from a messy corner and @entity74 released by @entity168 had a left - footer saved			0
@entity10 's top scorer then beat the ground with his fist as he came within inches of reaching crosses from either full - back			2
then the red card rocked the home team			0
without @entity4 , they are not the same team , losing the midfield balance , which will concern @entity11 as he looks at the next three games			2
@entity4 's dismissal is unlikely to be overturned as @entity16 ' provocation is not sufficient enough as a defence			2
the @entity3 forward however could face an @entity296 charge for his part in the incident			0
@entity38 levelled from the corner to earn the point @entity166 thought his battling team deserved , and they might have had more			0
as @entity10 pressed forward in search of a late winner , @entity156 broke clear in the fourth minute of stoppage time and almost won it for @entity3			2
the @entity22 international steers the ball past the @entity3 goalkeeper after @entity308 crosses for him @entity150 could do nothing to prevent @entity56 finding the net as the @entity3 keeper throws out an arm and a leg in vain @entity56 wheels away in celebration as the @entity3 defenders look at one another as the league leaders go 1 - 0 up @entity56 points to his head as e celebrates with hazard after the @entity202 international beat two men to claim a brilliant assist @entity56 , who also scored against @entity325 in the @entity326 this week celebrates with his team - mates after firing @entity10 haead @entity10 midfielder @entity329 catches @entity3 's @entity117 in the face with his arm during a challenge @entity3 striker @entity16 goes down under a challenge from @entity10 defender @entity137 @entity334 strains every sinew as he rises to head clear under a challenge from @entity16 during the first half january signing @entity191 takes on @entity3 full back @entity31 during saturday 's clash at @entity34 @entity10 manager @entity11 barks instructions to his players from the touchline during the match against @entity3 @entity10 captain @entity138 warms up ahead of kick - off as the players wear t - shirts reading ' support @entity10 , support equality ' a @entity10 supporter holds up an anti-racism sign that reads ' no racism at @entity352 , that 's the way we like it !
