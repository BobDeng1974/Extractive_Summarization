@entity1 's most senior police officer yesterday warned that right - wing extremists could ' hijack ' vigilante patrols protecting against looters			1
acting metropolitan police commissioner @entity5 singled out the @entity6 and the @entity7 as two organisations who might exploit the situation			1
his warning comes amid intelligence that the @entity6 has successfully infiltrated vigilante groups in @entity14 , @entity15 – scene of some of the worst mindless violence and criminality on sunday night – and @entity20 in @entity21			1
extremists : a police officer directs men off the street as vigilantes were joined by members of the @entity6 on a march through @entity14 , north @entity21 protest : vigilantes run through the streets of @entity14 on tuesday night			1
police accused them of diverting resources away from other communities police warn the potential for this to ' fuel the flames ' of an already fraught situation by adding a ' violent racial element ' is ' enormous and worrying			1
' residents claimed some @entity6 supporters were involved in organising vigilante patrols of young white men under the name @entity45 on tuesday night			1
they split into three 30 - strong groups in contact by mobile telephone and @entity49 to patrol the streets			2
underlining police concerns , the @entity6 said yesterday : ' supporters have taken to the streets to help defend their communities and prepare for the clean - up operations that must follow the last few days of rioting and looting			1
' we already have members organising themselves in @entity21 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , and are also looking to organise efforts in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
' drain on resources : police officers detain a man in @entity20 , south @entity21 , on tuesday night , where members of the @entity6 had gathered to act as anti-riot ' vigilantes ' mobs : a police van is patrols the streets in @entity20 , south - east @entity21 , as vigilantes mill around waiting for looters to appear hundreds of police officers descended on a @entity21 suburb last night to disperse about 60 men who claimed to be protecting shops and businesses there for a second night			1
the men , apparently supporters of the extreme - right @entity6 , gathered in a pedestrianised square in @entity20 drinking cans of beer and chanting ' we love you @entity95 '			1
with shops and pubs in the high street shut , the group – white men aged in their 20s to 50s – brought carrier bags with beer in them and drank and sat on benches			0
but around 300 police officers flooded the high street , surrounding the group			0
around 8.30pm , the order was given to disperse the group of @entity6 supporters – and youths who had arrived to see what was going on			2
officers moved in to shepherd the group away from the square , known as @entity117 , and out of the town down @entity119			0
it was reported that some bottles were thrown at the police			0
the presence of the @entity6 in @entity20 has been condemned by local politicians			0
@entity20 mp @entity125 , a shadow home office spokesman said : ' the @entity6 just want to put a sinister racial twist on this			1
' all these police resources for what ? to deal with the @entity6 ? that 's appalling			2
these police officers could be used elsewhere , protecting communities across @entity21 , but they have got to be in here to deal with these drunken yobs who have decided to come to @entity20 and cause racial tension			1
' on tuesday night around 50 members of the group joined with 150 to 200 locals to protect @entity20 from looters they claimed were expected to try to attack the area			1
they tried to march towards @entity141 – hit by rioting on monday night – but were pushed back towards @entity20 by police and dispersed around 11.30pm			0
there were no arrests and no reports of damage			0
speaking as he toured @entity14 yesterday , mr @entity5 said : ' i am worried that there are groups out there like the @entity6 and @entity7 who are trying to hijack this and cause more tensions in the community			1
they are politically motivated groups who have another agenda			0
' he added : ' i have not got a problem with community groups protecting their property or places of worship , which was n't needed in the end			0
' but he warned : ' the police will arrest anyone committing a criminal act , whether they are looting or vigilantes breaking the law			1
' the @entity172 's deputy assistant commissioner @entity171 echoed those warnings yesterday , saying : ' what i do n't need is these so - called vigilantes , who appeared to have been drinking too much , taking policing resources away from what they should have been doing – which is preventing the looting			0
' he spoke out after hundreds of residents in several @entity21 areas joined together to drive off would - be looters			2
some groups had armed themselves with lengths of pipe and baseball bats , while some shopkeepers had knives in their stores , claiming that police were ' nowhere to be seen ' and had ' failed ' them during the first three days of violence			0
@entity196 men armed with hockey sticks and metal bars were on guard yesterday in both @entity200 and @entity201 and stressed they were there with the ' full knowledge ' of police			0
yesterday , the @entity6 said : ' we are hoping to safeguard local businesses through a strong physical presence , and discourage trouble - makers from gathering in our town and city centres			2
' the @entity6 , and all decent people , be they black , white , @entity211 , @entity196 , @entity212 or @entity213 , are sickened by this mindless , selfish and ultimately self - defeating behaviour			2
' but @entity215 , the anti-fascist organisation , expressed deep concern last night at the @entity6 involvement , saying : ' the news that the @entity6 is promising to come out on the streets to defend our communities from rioters should be met with the derision and contempt it deserves			2
' the @entity6 is the last thing our communities need			0
