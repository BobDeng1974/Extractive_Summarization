@entity0 equalled @entity3 's @entity2 record by reaching 71 goals in 90 games as @entity6 beat @entity7 to reach the last 16			1
playing against his old club , @entity8 is without a goal in his first three games for @entity6 but @entity0 's double at least meant the former @entity14 striker got his first win for his new club			1
@entity0 scored from @entity18 's cross on 76 minutes to reach @entity3 's landmark and book @entity6 's place in the knockout stages			1
@entity0 heads into an empty net to give @entity6 the lead after @entity24 had come out but failed to clear the ball @entity26 goalkeeper @entity24 left his line but failed to collect the ball , leaving @entity0 to head @entity30 's cross into an empty net @entity8 's pin - point cross finds @entity0 at the far post leaving the unfortunate @entity24 unable to cover @entity35 star @entity0 celebrates scoring the opening goal of the game , which took his tally to 70 @entity2 goals @entity0 is congratulated by @entity40 , @entity8 and @entity41 after moving within one goal of @entity3 's @entity2 record @entity7 : @entity24 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 80 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 72 ) , @entity53 , @entity54 ( @entity55 62 ) , @entity56			1

@entity8 's best opportunity to open his account came on the hour when @entity0 played him through			1
he had promised not to celebrate if he scored against his former club and the promise was not tested as @entity24 came out to save his shot			2
@entity72 was once again out in the cold this time not in the stands but on the bench as @entity85 paired @entity30 with @entity65			2
@entity69 took his place in midfield to draw level with @entity89 on a record 144 @entity2 games , but all eyes were on @entity8			1
the man who scored over 100 goals for @entity7 in little more than 150 games , captained them to success in the @entity98 final in his final full season and played enough games in his last campaign – before moving to @entity14 in january 2011 – to earn a league winners medal has always enjoyed the unstinting support of the club 's supporters even during what was a troubled last season at the club marred by a ban for biting @entity109			1
they cheered his name as the @entity6 team was read out and just hoped he would net score his first @entity6 goal against them			2
@entity6 's former player @entity114 , who is now @entity115 at @entity7 , described the @entity6 front three that @entity8 now makes up with @entity0 and @entity41 as ' a dream ' before the game but this was the first time the fantastic three had finished the game with three points ; albeit after a difficult first half			1
@entity41 had the ball in the net on four minutes but his goal was ruled out for offside and it was the last we saw of @entity6 's attack for a while as @entity7 domintated			1
@entity128 picked up on a poor clearance from @entity63 and shaved a post with his shot and @entity62 then had to turn @entity133 's shot away for a corner as @entity7 had their first chances			0
@entity62 's save and some timely interceptions from @entity40 and @entity65 were all that was keeping @entity7 at bay			0
@entity8 forced a corner to give @entity6 some much - needed respite but @entity7 were laying siege to @entity6 's goal			1
@entity142 handled in the box and was lucky to escape without conceding a penalty			0
at the other end he forced a save from @entity24 but @entity7 remained on top			2
the night gets worse for @entity58 's men when @entity45 is sent off for picking up two bookings former @entity150 forward @entity41 holds off @entity151 at the @entity152 on wednesday night @entity6 's @entity154 forward @entity8 leaps into the air to reach the ball during his side 's clash with @entity7 in @entity159 former @entity14 and @entity160 midfielder @entity65 fights for the ball with @entity162 @entity163 remonstrates with former @entity165 midfielder @entity164 during the @entity167 match they were furious when @entity151 stayed down injured in the @entity6 area and the visitors played on and forced a free - kick at the other end			1
@entity0 took the kick and @entity24 saved brilliantly but seconds later he made the mistake that would cost @entity7 the lead			1
he came for a 50 - 50 ball with @entity30 , lost the race			0
the central defender crossed from the byline and @entity0 scored with a looping header			1
it was the most unusual of goals – a @entity0 header from a cross from a centre - half – but it calmed @entity6 's nerves in what had been a chaotic first half			1
and it was goal number 70 in 90 @entity2 games that left him level with @entity193 and one short of @entity3 's record			1
@entity0 turned provider on the hour sliding a pass through for @entity8			2
it should have been his first goal for @entity6			0
his first touch took him clear of the @entity7 defence but @entity24 won the one - on - one and so there was no ' no - celebration ' from the @entity154 who had promised to respect his former supporters			2
@entity55 headed against the post as @entity7 pushed for the equalizer but they were reduced to ten men when @entity45 was sent off for a second bookable offence and as @entity6 poured forward wth the extra man @entity0 got his historic goal			1
@entity8 promised not to celebrate against his old club , but that promise was n't tested after he missed his one - on - one @entity26 winger @entity151 , who is only 19 - years - old , tries to shake off the attention of @entity214 full back @entity40 @entity0 takes a free - kick during the first half , @entity215 keeper @entity24 dived to his right to bat it away the result will calm talk of crisis at the @entity224			1
@entity8 will hope he gets off the mark soon after another frustrating night in front of goal			0
there were at least signs in the second half when he played more centrally and @entity0 tucked in behind him that things are beginning to click			0
@entity85 still has problems , with @entity233 below par at right - back and @entity72 an unused substitute			2
but he also has @entity0			0
the @entity35 had a quiet first half hour as @entity6 suffered but when he came alive he killed the game			0
and at just 27 years of age has leveled with @entity3 – the only difference being that it has taken him 90 games and not 142 as it did the @entity241			0
' @entity0 is the best player i have seen in my life ' said @entity85 after his double			2
he added : ' we were better in the second half			0
we always tried to win the ball back as far from our goal as possible and we were able to do that better after the break			0
' it 's important qualify with two games left			0
we have to improve we know that much but i have no complaints about the attitude of my players			0
' @entity6 's talented front three of @entity8 , @entity0 and @entity41 discuss their plan for a free - kick @entity7 's players defend frantically while @entity41 and @entity0 try to pick up the loose ball in the box @entity46 reacts angrily to a decision by referee @entity76 during the @entity167 clash in @entity159 @entity7 midfielder @entity264 kicks the ball away while being closed down by @entity6 's @entity266 @entity7 fans wave their flags and play drums in the build up to the match against the @entity214 giants in the @entity26 capital former @entity14 striker @entity8 , now playing for @entity6 , spent four years with @entity7 in what was an incredibly prolific period former @entity6 midfielder and current manager @entity85 watches on as his team face the @entity26 giants in @entity152 @entity6 's players celebrate after ending their two - game losing streak with a 2 - 0 win over @entity7 @entity8 applauds the crowd at his old home stadium - the @entity152 - where he spent four years with @entity7 @entity8 is without a goal in his first three games for @entity6 , but he did at least get his first win on wednesday			1

@entity72 dropped for the second *consecutive* match by @entity6 boss @entity85
@entity0 opened the scoring with a header after an error by @entity7 goalkeeper @entity24
@entity0 then scored again to equal @entity3 's @entity2 goal - scoring record of 71 strikes
@entity45 was sent off for @entity58 's side
@entity8 started against his former club @entity7 , where he spent four successful years
