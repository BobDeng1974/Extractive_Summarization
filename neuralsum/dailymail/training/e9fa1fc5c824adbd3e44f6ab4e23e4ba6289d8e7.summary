by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 06:54 est , 26 june 2013 researchers have proved that brain - training programs can significantly improve memory and language skills - especially in older people			1
the study from @entity8 found that just 20 minutes of brain training once every four days can improve your immediate memory recall , and help you remember things for longer			1
previous studies have claimed that brain training programs can delay dementia in later life but little research has been done into the immediate benefits of the software on older people			1
researchers from @entity21 have found that computerised brain training programs can significantly improve memory and language skills , especially in older people			1
previous studies found the games can ward off dementia in later life but the immediate benefits of the programs were relatively unknown evidence suggests that adults who keep their brains active by reading , listening to the radio or doing puzzles , can delay the onset of dementia			2
but these people may then decline more quickly when they do eventually exhibit symptoms			0
according to dr @entity37 from @entity38 in @entity39 , mentally stimulating activities may help the brain ' rewire ' itself to circumvent the effects of dementia			0
however , once the disease is diagnosed , damage to the brain is likely to be greater than it would be in someone who was not mentally stimulated			0
during the 12 - year study , @entity37 found that mental activity appeared to delay the start of @entity51 's and then speed up its progress , while reducing the overall amount of time a person suffers from the disease			0
the @entity8 team studied 69 dementia - free participants , with an average age of 82			0
they each lived in retirement communities in southern @entity21			0
each participant played a computerized brain - fitness program called @entity62			0
the program trains the brain through more than 400 exercises in the areas of short - and long - term memory , language , visual - spatial processing , reasoning and problem - solving , and calculation skills			1
of the 69 participants , 52 of them played at least 40 sessions of the game over a six - month period			0
each session lasted 20 minutes			0
all of the 52 participants showed improvement in both immediate and delayed memory skills , as well as language skills , when compared with the 17 members from a control group			1
the findings suggest that older adults who participate in computerised brain training can improve their cognitive skills			1
according to the researchers , age - related memory decline affects approximately 40 percent of older adults			2
this @entity8 study is one of the first studies to assess the cognitive effects of a computerised memory - training program			2
the study 's findings add to a body of research exploring whether brain fitness tools may help improve language and memory and ultimately help protect individuals from the cognitive decline associated with aging and alzheimer 's disease			2
according to @entity8 research , just 20 minutes of brain - training once every four days using software such as @entity107 , pictured left , and dr @entity110 's brain training : how @entity113 ? , right , can significantly improve memory and language skills in older people for example , they confirm the findings from @entity120 , which claimed just 15 minutes a day spent on brain training exercises promotes the growth of new brain cells			1
the @entity125 researchers studied 64 people , aged from 20 to 71 and suffering problems including traumatic brain damage , stroke and dementia			2
one group of volunteers were given handheld electronic devices and asked to play a brain training game which tested short - term memory for just 15 minutes			1
the others carried out traditional word recall exercises using pen and paper			0
the researchers then tested all the participants on a traditional memory recall task , and found a significant improvement in both groups			1
but for those who had practised on computer games , recall had improved by 60 per cent - compared with 37 per cent for those who practised on paper .			0

researchers from @entity21 noticed a significant improvement in memory among older people who played brain training games
the study also found that games *increased* the participants ' language skills
