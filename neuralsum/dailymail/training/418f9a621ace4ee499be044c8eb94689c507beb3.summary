an incredibly rare albino dolphin was filmed near the @entity2 coast hunting for its dinner			1
the albino bottlenose , thought to be an adolescent , was seen poking its dorsal fin above the water several times in the @entity9 , by the east coast of the state			1
a few seconds later it exposes more of its body - and briefly crests the surface with its nose - before swimming away with a regular - colored gray bottlenose			0
some researchers believe there are only 20 albino dolphins on the planet			1
@entity41 filmed the creature swimming not far from the shore on december 10 , and the footage was uploaded to @entity45 by the institute just over a week later			0
it has reportedly been seen again in the area since			0
according to @entity51 , the animal 's behavior implies that it was hunting fish during the filming			1

dolphins with especially severe albino traits can sometimes suffer from impaired vision - though the rarity of the creatures means that extensive research is yet to be carried out , and theories often have to be extrapolated from albino humans			2
although rare , the white dolphins often capture the imaginations of marine enthusiasts			2
sightings of a baby albino off the @entity95 coast in 2007 caused a flurry of excitement , as did an adult albino , who was found swimming in the @entity100 , near @entity61 , last summer			2
in the wild : this photograph , by diver and photographer @entity102 , shows an albino off the @entity107 coast			0
