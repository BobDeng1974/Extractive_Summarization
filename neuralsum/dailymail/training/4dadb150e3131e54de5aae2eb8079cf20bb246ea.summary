angry birds game , which counts @entity1 and @entity2 as fans , worth £ 1.2billion flock of fans have already downloaded 250million times by @entity7 reporter last updated at 9:49 am on 13th august 2011 @entity10 , the world 's largest internet social network acted yesterday to boost its games content			1
the move came on the same day that @entity13 introduced games on its recently - launched social network @entity15			2
@entity13 launched its social networking site in june , signing up more than 10 million users in the first two weeks			2
game : @entity19 is now on offer on @entity15 , if you 've have n't got an iphone the company said it would offer 16 games from third party developers on @entity15 , including @entity26 , @entity27 and the infectiously popular @entity19 game			1
the game has become a blockbuster , with users downloading it 250million times to launch furious birds at egg - stealing green pigs			1
dveloped by @entity36 , there are rumours that companies want to invest in the game which would make it worth an estimated £ 1.2billion			1
its flock of fans spend a combined 200million minutes throwing angry birds at pinching pigs and the game has sold more than three million toys , according to @entity47			1
@entity13 , which has a stake of undisclosed size in @entity26 , said it will roll out games gradually on @entity15 , and make the game feature available to everyone ' soon			1
' games on @entity15 have their own separate page , which may help convert @entity10 users bored with reading their friends ’ game notifications			1
new look : search engine giant @entity13 brought its own twist to social networking @entity62 , @entity13 senior vice president , @entity61 said : ' that means giving you control over when you see games , how you play them and with whom you share your experiences			2
' games in @entity15 are there when you want them and gone when you do n’t			2
' ' you can see the latest game updates from your circles , browse the invites you 've received and check out games that people you know have played recently			1
founder : @entity78 in a news conference at @entity10 headquarters ' your circles will only see the updates when they ’re interested in playing games too			2
' and @entity15 users who have no interest in playing online games can just ignore the games tab			2
now @entity10 is keen to harness the popularity of games on its service			2
@entity10 , which was hosting 100 game developers for an event at its @entity94 headquarters in @entity95 , announced some new features to improve the gaming experience on its website , as well as a policy loosening restrictions on how developers can market their games			1
the changes will expand the types of notifications that @entity10 users see when their friends are playing games on the website , rolling back restrictions made last year that provoked grumbles among some game developers			1
@entity10 head of games @entity113 said : ' our games ecosystem has continued to grow			0
but there 's no question that we want to grow it faster in a more high quality way for our users and developers			0
' games such as @entity26 's @entity125 are some of the most popular activities on @entity10			0
more than 200million users play games on @entity10 every month , and the company takes a 30 per cent cut of the sale of virtual goods bought by users during gaming			0
@entity135 : games such as @entity125 provide income for @entity10 with the two web giants competing to attract users to their respective online services , the dueling social gaming announcements underscored what could emerge as a key battleground between the two companies			0
@entity144 , a partner at venture capital firm @entity145 , which has invested in social game companies said of @entity13 's announcement : ' it turns out that people like to play games , and it 's core to the social networking use case			1
' online : sites such as @entity10 allow users to keep up to date with friends @entity144 added that @entity13 's move to offer games on its social network provides game developers with a compelling alternative to @entity10			1
but he said the most important consideration for game makers is which social network has the most users			1
' right now no one is going to be willing to give up @entity10 because it 's where the users are today			0
@entity15 got a terrific start but it 's got a ways to go			0
' among the new gaming features introduced by @entity10 on thursday are the ability to expand the size of the window in which games are played on @entity10 's site , new ways for users to create bookmarks for their favorite games and a scrolling ' ticker ' that highlights the games a person 's friends are playing , their recent scores and achievements			0
in loosening restrictions on game updates within @entity10 's general newsfeed , the company must walk a fine line between helping developers promote their games on the network and irking users that are not avid gamers			1
@entity10 's newsfeed - which displays a rolling stream of messages , photos and updates from friends - is a vital distribution channel for gamemakers , allowing companies like @entity26 , @entity206 ' @entity205 and @entity207 to reach vast numbers of users			0
but it has caused some backlash among @entity10 's non-gaming users , who found the constant notifications about their friends ' progress within various games to be irrelevant and annoying			0
@entity216 : @entity13 headquarters in @entity218 , @entity94 last year , @entity10 clamped down on the practice , so that @entity10 users would receive notifications only about games which they had also installed			0
under the new policy , @entity10 users will see notifications about any game their friends are playing			2
but @entity113 said the company had developed special algorithms that will only display updates if @entity10 has a reason to believe they are relevant to the person			0
if the person shows no interest in certain types of games , @entity10 wo n't serve them updates in the newsfeed			0
' no one wants to go back to the bad old days of people being very unhappy about gaming because they feel like they 're being spammed all the time , ' said @entity113			0
' that 's the key which we really spent months and months working on , is that tricky balance of trying to expose a lot more games to people , but only to the people who we think want to play those games			0
