emerging out of the landscape with the rumble of its powerful engine , this sinister - looking machine looks as if it comes from a battlefield or the set of a @entity7 film			2
but instead of helping people face a fictional apocalyptic reality , the tractor is the latest in agricultural machinery and is designed to make life easier for farmers			1
called the @entity15 , it can cultivate a staggering 150 acres of land in a single day , which is the equivalents of 100 football pitches			1
the @entity33 - made tractor is guided by gps and steers with an accuracy over the ground of less than an inch			1
gps systems are used to steer tractors in more precise patterns than humans are capable of			1
the @entity33 - made tractor is controlled by satellite and works and steers with an accuracy over the ground of less than an inch			1
its rugged appearance bears some resemblance to the vehicles in @entity7 ( pictured ) called the @entity15 , the tractor ( pictured ) can cultivate a staggering 150 acres of land in a single day , which is the equivalents of 100 football pitches			1
and unlike the vehicles in @entity7 , it 's built to keep drivers comfortable , with leather seats and a dvd player fitted in the cab @entity60 told @entity61 that @entity34 steering systems are farmers ’ favourite piece of modern farming technology			1
steering systems got one third of the total votes out of the top 10 favourite farming tools			1
they are used to steer tractors in more precise patterns than humans are capable of , resulting in significant savings and improved productivity			2
@entity34 provides accurate location information by calculating the distance from at least three satellites and can also be used on farms to analyse soil fertility , @entity76 , professor of biological and agricultural engineering at @entity78 wrote in an article for the conversation			1
farmers can use a gps receiver to collect soil samples from pre-selected parts of fields			1
they then send the samples off to a lab for analysis , which creates a fertility map of their farm			2
farmers can use the map to work out the amount of fertiliser needed for each location , giving their crops the best chance of growing and saving them money			2
variable - rate technology ( @entity107 ) fertiliser applicators dispense just the right amount of fertiliser in each location , varying the qualities as the farmers go along			2
before @entity34 , it was down to the driver to keep the tractor straight to avoid using too much seed , fertiliser or fuel , but today many farmers have some form of gps steering , which means overlapping has all but disappeared and straight lines are easy			1
this has resulted in significant savings and improved productivity , which is why the innovation is a firm favourite with tech - savvy farmers			2
@entity34 self - steering systems were voted as being @entity134 farmners ' favourite piece of modern farming technology in a poll by @entity60			2
but not all tractors using the technology are as impressive and inwardly luxurious as this latest model			2
despite its rugged appearance , the tractor offers a comfortable ride for drivers			1
the cab is fitted with climate control and the seat is leather and heated			1
there is even a dvd player to watch while the tractor follows its pre-set path up and down fields			1
only 28 of the machines - which cost up to a quarter of a million pounds each ( $ 373,000 ) - will be made , and @entity134 is set to be one of the biggest markets			0
one @entity157 land - owner said : ‘ years ago a 1,000 - acre farm would have employed 40 men - but with a machine like this the same acreage can be farmed by just one man			2
’ in the film , people travel across an apocalyptic wasteland with few resources in a bid to survive			0
@entity7 , a man of action and few words , seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos			0
this truck is one of the extraordinary vehicles to feature in the latest film only 28 of the machines ( pictured ) - which cost up to a quarter of a million pounds each ( $ 373,000 ) - will be made , and @entity134 is set to be one of the biggest markets the tractor 's rugged appearance bears some resemblance to the vehicles in @entity190 still from the latest film , shows @entity191 , who plays @entity7 riding a motorcycle in considerable discomfort			1
however , the tractor features luxuries such as leather seats , for example for farmers , aerial photographs taken by drones offer a quick and easy way to check on the progress of crops and determine where they may need to replant or direct pesticide applications			1
researchers at the @entity208 are using drones on farms to take aerial photos of crops growing in research plots			0
@entity214 , a crop science teacher at the university , deliberately made mistakes on one test plot by not applying enough nitrogen fertilizer and is now using drones to see if they can reveal potentially weaker crops			0
‘ as the crop gets up and going , we 'll fly over it and see if we can detect those areas sooner than we could visually from the ground , ’ he said			0
‘ we 're also looking at doing some scans over our herbicide studies to see if the drone photography can help us identify where crops are stressed by postemergence herbicide applications			0
’ mr @entity214 spent two summers as a commercial crop scout and said that walking through tasseling corn in high temperatures is unpleasant			0
‘ the odds of actually getting to the far end of that field on foot to see what 's going on are pretty slim			0
to get a bird 's - eye view of your crop , the drones offer a handy way to do it			0
’ he is using two quadricopters affixed with a @entity249 camera and a @entity251 camera with a lens for infrared photography to see if they can spot potential crop trouble			0
‘ standard pictures and video taken with drones can tell us a lot			0
but what we 're looking to give us even more information is multispectral cameras that can give us imagery in other wavelengths , such as near - infrared , to help us identify areas of crop stress			0
‘ it probably is n't going to tell us what the problem is , but it will tell us where problems are so that we can target our scouting in those specific areas and determine what might be occurring			0
’ infrared images will help the researchers identify plants in the farm that appear to be absorbing or reflecting light differently - an indication that the plants are under some type of stress , such as pests , disease or nutrient deficiencies			0
the drones may be used to spot an invasive weed called @entity289 amaranth , which is spreading across the @entity290 and is becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides to the extent that it could drastically reduce farmers ' yield potential in affected fields			0
‘ before the soybean rows close , or if we get a different spectrum response from some of these weeds as they break through the canopy , we may see some of those weeds show up in the imagery as well to identify where there are hot spots and problems , ’ mr @entity214 said .			0

tractor has a rugged look and is the latest in agricultural machinery
@entity15 can cultivate 150 acres of land in a single day
it has a gps steering system so it can drive in *perfectly* straight lines
cab of the tractor has luxuries such as leather seats and a dvd player
