by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 and @entity4 will be in @entity5 to watch the first head - to - head in what promises to be an intriguing early - season tussle for @entity10 fly - half places			1
the two national coaches will be fascinated spectators at the @entity12 as @entity13 and @entity15 lock horns when @entity16 take on @entity17			1
the pair will be aiming to guide their sides to an opening win in the @entity21 , but also score personal points ahead of next month ’s belated naming of the senior eps squad for the autumn international campaign			0
@entity13 will be out to continue the positive momentum which propelled him back into the @entity27 ranks at the end of last season			1
fly - half : @entity31 man @entity13 is hoping to seal his place as @entity10 's fly - half having done enough to convince @entity34 and his assistants that he had the requisite attitude to go with his considerable talent , he was picked for the tour of @entity39 and fared well with encouraging cameos in the first and third @entity41 , and a fine game against the @entity43			1
in contrast , @entity44 is playing catch - up as he seeks to re-establish his own burgeoning credentials			1
the 21 - year - old had climbed to the status of first reserve during the @entity51 – ending the tournament with a glittering contribution off the bench against @entity55 in @entity56			2
yet , just as the @entity17 tyro seemed destined to go to @entity39 as first - choice for the series opener , in the temporary absence of @entity61 , he aggravated a shoulder injury and was told he needed surgery			2
forced to watch the tour from afar , he saw @entity65 and @entity13 push their selection case			1
it left him driven to respond at the start of this season , in the knowledge @entity72 of @entity73 is also in the @entity10 mix. competition : @entity15 is playing catch - up as he seeks to re-establish himself after his injury statement : has @entity13 done enough to convince @entity3 he has the attitude to go with his talent ? @entity81 will make his competitive debut for @entity83 against @entity84 at @entity85 today , with his own agendas to address			1
he will be desperate to show more of the composed form he produced against the @entity39 in @entity88 , to move on from an altogether more chastening experience in @entity90 two weeks later			0
and he will be striving to fend off the challenge for the @entity83 playmaker role posed by @entity93 , who is available again after serving a ban			0
@entity93 was sufficiently convincing in his work in the shadow of @entity97 last season that the rookie ultimately ousted the far more experienced @entity10 stand - off from the @entity101			1
he was on course to go to @entity103 with @entity104 in june , until being suspended for gouging @entity105 in the @entity83 ’ @entity21 semi-final defeat at @entity109			0
options : as well as @entity13 and @entity44 , @entity65 and @entity72 are other options for @entity34 @entity10 forwards coach @entity113 will be at @entity85 but , rather than focusing on the scrap for the hosts ’ fly half berth , his eye will be drawn to more earthy matters up front			1
he will monitor @entity120 ’ return to action after the @entity83 hooker missed the @entity39 trip on compassionate grounds			0
@entity84 replacement props @entity125 and @entity127 will also come under scrutiny			0
@entity129 admits he will be inspired by @entity130 when he leads @entity131 for the 2014 - 15 season			2
@entity129 ’s first taste of captaincy will be today ’s opening match of the traditional @entity137 double - header against @entity138 at @entity139			2
@entity129 played alongside @entity130 for six years			0
he said : ‘ to me @entity130 was everything you want in a leader			0
i ’m not trying to be @entity130 wo n’t copy him			0
you ca n’t help but be inspired by a guy who was a natural leader and had respect from people			0
