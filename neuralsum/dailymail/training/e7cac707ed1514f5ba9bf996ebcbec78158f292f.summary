an unlikely entrant is about to join the space race next year , as @entity2 launches its first home - built satellite			0
the country 's first satellite may not cause too much jealousy at @entity8 - the @entity10 - 1 satellite is made of three 10cm by 10cm cubes , slightly more modest than the @entity12			1
@entity13 is being built at the @entity15 @entity14 in @entity16 , @entity17 by a local company , @entity18			1
@entity21 's @entity20 - 1 satellite will be the first satellite to launch from @entity15 - the hi - tech vehicle is expected to launch next year gateway to the stars ? workers at @entity21 claim that few people believe that they are making satellites in @entity17 's @entity16 ( pictured ) @entity29 's systems engineer @entity28 says , ' people often ask me what my job is and i tell them that i 'm building satellites in @entity16 ' ‘ sometimes they do n't believe it			1
sometimes they laugh at me			0
’ @entity18 has made dozens of tiny ' @entity37 ' vehicles for other companies - 10cm by 10cm cubes			1
chief executive @entity40 says , ‘ a typical @entity37 mission was a student - built satellite that would maybe go beep or try something out that did n't cost a lot of money			2
' but the company is to link three cubes together to create @entity10 - 1 - which will be the first complete satellite to be assembled by @entity18			2
it 's part of a pilot programme from the @entity53 to test new technologies in space			0
mechanical design engineer @entity56 is well aware of its particular significance for @entity18 - and for @entity15			0
‘ it 's our first full platform , ’ he said			0
‘ so by demonstrating this we can demonstrate that we can build a full satellite			0
we 'll have the pedigree			0
’ @entity37 is expected to enter orbit next year			1
to boldly go : scientists hope to have @entity13 , which stands for @entity67 @entity66 , in orbit later this year the underlying @entity37 concept came originally from @entity69 - to create a satellite 10cm by 10cm by 10cm			1
more than 600 cubesats have been launched so far			0
the @entity17 firm has made components for 40 % of them			2
examples include @entity8 's @entity75 - 1 , a 5 kilogram @entity37 which is carrying bacteria inside a miniature laboratory and @entity8 's @entity79 mission which is studying the relationship between lightning and mysterious bright flashes of gamma radiation in the upper atmosphere of our planet			2
the low - @entity88 orbit of @entity37 is also ideal for disaster monitoring and @entity88 sciences , as the lower a satellite orbits , the less time it takes to complete a revolution of the @entity88 .			1

satellite made in @entity17 's @entity16
three linked ' cubes ' will orbit @entity88 and radio to ground
' @entity37 ' vehicle is just 10cm by 10cm
expected to launch in 2013
