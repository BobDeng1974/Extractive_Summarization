by @entity0 a new app , put together by the @entity2 , allows users to virtually step back onto the city streets of @entity5 in the 1800s to experience the city 's rich history and the majesty behind some of its old architecture			1
the mobile phone program was developed in a bid to engage the library 's audience in a new way while making a fraction of their collection of 300,000 photographs more accessible			1
using up to 300 photographs , @entity23 : @entity24 uses your location to show nearby buildings , street views and aerial photographs - as well as the stories of each location - from as early as 1840			1
' there 's kind of a perception that the old city of @entity5 has been progressively demolished over the years , but one of the fascinating things is once you 're aware of what lies beneath the surface , you realise that old @entity5 is still there - it 's just hidden , ' @entity32 , the @entity2 of @entity34 's director of digital strategy said			1
@entity43 ( left ) was completed in 1910			2
it is now @entity5 's busiest station ( right ) , used by over 100,000 people every day			1
in 2013 the @entity48 announced a billion dollar refurbishment , to include a water - front amphitheatre and a market whilst still retaining the iconic dome and arched entrance the @entity54 ( pictured left in 1954 ) were a six storied brick building on the corner of @entity57 and @entity58 , built in the early 1890s , and was home to the @entity60 and @entity61			2
the building was sold to the @entity63 in 1946 and demolished in the 1970s			2
it was replaced with an office block , which then gave way to a busy shopping mall the @entity67 was a three storey building on the corner of @entity57 and @entity69 , constructed in 1880			2
after demolition , the doorway was placed on the facade of the @entity73 in the grounds of the @entity75			2
following the demolition of the school , the doorway was placed at an exit from the university 's underground car park			1
it is now a set of shops ' for instance , i noticed the other day that if you look at the @entity88 and look at earlier photos , part of the facade is missing – the front of the building as it 's currently presented is very different			1
' it ’s an old building so you 'd expect it to look the way it used to look			2
but you can see how things have changed			2
a lot of things have evolved with the times , but buildings are still there			1
' another obvious interesting point is where buildings have just disappeared			2
one of the sad loses of the city was the old @entity5 fish markets			1
they were an extraordinary set of old @entity112 buildings down at the far end of @entity43 - they were demolished in 1956 and replaced with a car park			2
' built in 1888 , the @entity115 stood at the corner of @entity117 and @entity118 - once the largest hotel in @entity120			0
it went broke , along with many other @entity5 businesses and re-opened in 1923 with an alcohol licence , as the @entity124			1
it contained over 400 bedrooms , billiards rooms and dining room , with a sign over the entrance which read ' stay here			0
you 'll be welcome '			0

the first @entity149 ( left ) opened in february 1856 , during the @entity34 gold rush			1
the current building ( right ) , which is in fact made up of 23 buildings , takes up an entire city block the app began being designed when the @entity2 noticed the sheer interest in their images as well as urban history amongst the general public			1
' the proportion of files being accessed via our catalogue were images , and this had gone up 300 per cent in a two year period , ' mr @entity32 said			1
' we also noticed an emergence in interest in urban history and a lot of our images are appearing on the web in context of people really getting into what the city used to look like			1
' the bluestone @entity178 ( left ) on @entity179 was built in the mid 1800s and housed both male and female criminals			0
during its operation it housed many hardened criminals , as well as petty offenders , the mentally ill and the homeless			0

' the reason it 's called @entity23 is because we started with intentions of extending it into a series , ' mr @entity32 said			1
' the feedback we 've received from our social media communities is people love the app and they 're saying " when are you going to do my suburb ? " ' it can certainly extend out to even regional areas ; the gold fields are a perfect opportunity and point in history			1
we have a very rich collection for the early gold days and virtually every area has a rich history			2
