isolated : age @entity0 warned that nearly 400,000 people aged at least 65 were worried about being lonely this @entity2			1
above , file image beleaguered @entity7 departments face being overwhelmed at @entity2 by lonely , elderly people , @entity5 ’s most senior casualty doctor said last night			1
the warning from professor @entity10 came as care minister @entity11 urged @entity5 to care for isolated neighbours to prevent the @entity0 becoming a ‘ neglectful society ’			1
professor @entity10 , the director for acute care for @entity16 , said the impact of loneliness on older people could cause a major spike in admissions to @entity7			1
studies show sick people left alone over the festive period are more likely to go to casualty with worse problems			2
he urged any who are ill to call their pharmacist , gp or the @entity32 helpline for advice , adding : ‘ do n’t end up in @entity7 please			1
’ @entity7 departments are in crisis			1
fewer than 90 per cent of patients were seen within four hours at casualty in the week up to december 14 – the worst week on record			0
last night , the charity @entity0 warned that nearly 400,000 people aged at least 65 were worried about being lonely this @entity2			1
in @entity16 , 51 per cent of all people over 75 live alone and 5million older people say the television is their main companion			1
recent town hall cuts mean more councils are only sending carers round for 15 - minute visits , even though this is often a pensioner ’s only contact in a week			1
research shows loneliness and social isolation are harmful to physical health			2
studies indicate that lack of social connections is as likely to cause early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day			2
professor @entity10 cited a recent study in the @entity61 that showed a clear link between social isolation and care needs in those over 75 admitted to @entity7			1
he warned anyone feeling ‘ under the weather ’ to get treatment early , and urged people to join @entity16 ’s @entity70 , which encourages people to look in on an elderly friend or neighbour over @entity2 to make sure they are warm and coping well			1
he added : ‘ over @entity2 we want to keep people out of @entity7 departments as far as possible			1
we know there is a correlation between people who are on their own and admission to hospital			2
‘ we often see a sharp spike in emergency admissions at this time of year and we know that the majority of these are elderly people who have stored up a health problem at home and have n’t sought treatment early hoping it will go away			1
’ mr @entity11 said too many people knew all about their friends on social media but nothing about those next door			2
if more people checked on vulnerable neighbours , he said , it would have a positive impact on their mental and physical health and ‘ help give them their life back ’			1
his plea came as official statistics showed just 44 per cent of elderly people receiving care services received as much social contact as they would like			1
the @entity110 minister said he volunteered once a fortnight to visit a 90 - year - old woman called @entity113 , to take her books to read and have a chat			1
he added : ‘ @entity2 is a time of contrasts			1
for most it is a time of family , social occasions and warmth			0
for those who are lonely it could n’t be more different			2
‘ for too many people @entity2 is a time when loneliness becomes so acute as to be almost unbearable			1
‘ it ’s the loneliness that gnaws away at us , steadily eroding our self - esteem and putting our mental and physical health at risk			1
‘ strong communities and a fairer society means doing our bit			2
it means looking in on neighbours – using some of our spare time for the benefit of others			2
‘ if you know someone who may be lonely , pick up the phone , visit or volunteer as i have in a small way			2
you do n’t know the difference it will make			0
’ this @entity2 , think about the people who live in the houses you walk past each day - and the neighbours you have never met , urges minister of state for care and support @entity11 call to action : care minister @entity11 , above , urges @entity5 to get to know their neighbours @entity2 is a time of contrasts			1
for most it is a time of family , social occasions and warmth			0
for those who are lonely it could n’t be more different			2
for too many people @entity2 is a time when loneliness becomes so acute as to be almost unbearable			1
it ’s the loneliness that gnaws away at us , steadily eroding our self - esteem and putting our mental and physical health at risk			1
it is a grim irony of modern life that we know the most intimate detail of our social media friends ’ lives , but often not even our neighbours ’ names			2
it can affect anyone and everyone and it is more complex than people living alone			1
it ’s the husband caring for his wife who has dementia , it is the family recently bereaved or it is the man who has lost touch with work friends since he retired			0
strong communities and a fairer society means doing our bit			2
it means looking in on neighbours			0
it means using some of our spare time for the benefit of others			0
we could all do more			0
we all want to do more			0
but in our busy lives it can be easy to forget that thousands of people can often go for days without speaking to the people they care about or without having contact with anyone at all			1
the @entity190 is a free confidential helpline providing friendship and advice to people			0
it is open 24 hours a day , every day of the year and i have seen for myself that it is a real lifeline for so many			0
i ’ve spoken to some of the wonderful characters who call @entity201 and it is plain to see that even a weekly call can make a difference			0
local and national government play a critical role in the community but society as a whole holds the answers			0
we are all living longer and our extended families have often been dispersed far and wide and as a result there is more chance of us being alone , socially isolated and lonely			2
all of us – including me - have to be more creative with how we make our communities better especially to make sure we do n’t become a neglectful society			1
inclusive : mr @entity11 is encouraging people to be more creative with how they make their communities better to make sure that we do n't become a neglectful society			1
( file image ) i am thankful to the thousands of people who already volunteer across the country			0
i know first - hand the satisfaction i get from volunteering with the @entity228			0
i visit a woman called @entity113 as part of the books on wheels service , once a fortnight i drop off books and stay for a chat			0
for some people who receive books as part of this service , the volunteer is the only person they ever see			0
i get a lot from the visit and i hope @entity113 does too			0
she is a wonderful 90 year old with amazing fighting spirit			0
we can not compel people to volunteer			0
our role is to support those projects which help people to volunteer and to create an environment where volunteering activities can take place more easily			0
this is why we have given funding grants to @entity255 and other organisations			0
formal care is also important , which is why we ’ve given councils an extra £ 1.1 billion this year for social care and will go further next year by joining up health and care services through our £ 5.3 billion @entity262			2
this integrated approach is already helping to tackle loneliness			0
for example , in @entity266 and in @entity267 , @entity268 , there are integrated care pioneer projects which are enabling older people to lead a more independent life and is helping to reduce @entity7 admissions			1
local gps link volunteers to people living alone			2
the simple act of friendship and companionship makes such a difference			0
you help to give that person their life back			0
and that has a positive impact on mental and physical health			0
this @entity2 , @entity288 and beyond i want to encourage people to think about the people who live in the houses they walk past each day – the neighbours they do n’t know and have never met			1
if you know someone who may be lonely , pick up the phone or visit			0
or volunteer your time as i have done in a small way			0
you do n’t know the difference it will make .			0
