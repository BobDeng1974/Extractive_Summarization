new technology is allowing people who are paralysed to walk again			2
@entity2 , 42 , suffered a serious work accident 11 years ago and damaged his spine which left him unable to walk			1
yet today he is able to get out of his chair , stand six foot two inches tall and walk across the room			1
this is all thanks to a lightweight robot he wears , referred to as ' electronic legs ' or a ' powered exoskelton '			2
@entity2 , 42 , injured his spine and was left unable to walk			1
but thanks to new ' wearable robots ' being developed , he is now able to stand up and walk on his own @entity2 's model is called @entity16 , and is among several competing products being used and tested in @entity19 rehabilitation hospitals that hold promise not only for people with spinal injuries , but also those recovering from strokes or suffering with multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy			1
the technology is thought to be at least a year away from the market , and at two stone , the @entity16 is the lightest of the powered exoskeletons			1
it snaps together from pieces that fit into a backpack			0
the goal is for the user to be able to carry it on a wheelchair , put it together , strap it on and walk independently			1
none of the products , including the @entity16 , are yet approved for personal use , meaning they must be used under the supervision of a physical therapist			1
@entity2 , from @entity47 , demonstrated the device this week at the @entity19 @entity50 meeting in @entity51 , and successfully negotiated a noisy , crowded hallway of medical professionals and people with spinal injuries in wheelchairs			1
write caption here when he leaned forward , the device took a first step			0
when he tilted from side to side , it walked			0
when @entity2 wanted to stop , he leaned back and the robotic leg braces came to a halt			1
@entity2 used forearm crutches for balance			1
a battery in the hip piece powers the motors in the robotic legs			0
' being able to speak eye - to - eye [ with a person ] is just a big emotional boost , ' @entity2 said			1
' being able to walk up to you and say hello is not a big thing until you can not do it			2
' the devices will not replace wheelchairs , which are faster			0
' none of the devices are speedy enough for a paralysed person to walk across a street before the light changes , ' said @entity83 of the @entity84 , who is testing a number of similar devices			0
' none of them have fall prevention technology either			0
if the person falls , they can hurt themselves badly			0
' if you fall down , how do you get off a robot that is strapped into you ? ' the technology needs to become even lighter and have longer - lasting batteries , he said			0
it is hoped the devices might help prevent pressure sores from sitting too long in a wheelchair , improve heart health , develop muscle strength , lift depression and ultimately bring down medical costs by keeping healthier patients out of the hospital			2
companies in @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 make competing devices , and all the products are becoming less bulky as they are refined			0
the @entity16 was invented at @entity115 in @entity116 and tested at the @entity117 , a rehabilitation hospital in @entity118			2
it 's unclear exactly how much the devices will cost if they become available for personal use			0
some technology news media reports have said $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 .			0

the @entity16 ' powered exoskeleton ' can be strapped to leg but weighs 2 stone
not available to *public* yet but hoped to be available within ' a few years '
@entity2 , 42 , lost ability to walk after work accident damaged his spine but now he can stand up and walk across the room without a wheelchair
