by @entity0 published : 16:24 gmt , 19 april 2013 updated : 18:00 gmt , 19 april 2013 few games divided opinion like @entity3			0
many praised the game 's wonderful graphics - going so far as to judge other gamers ' ' rigs ' on whether or not they could run the game at optimal settings			1
others could n't look past the somewhat clunky gameplay			0
even now , the combined use of @entity15 anti-aliasing , advanced depth of field effects , @entity19 10 object - based motion blur and a host of post processing effects is a challenge for most graphics cards			1
and @entity24 will be no different			0
what a view : last @entity24 is set to push pcs to their absolute limit - but can still be enjoyed on mid-range cards following on from the events of 2033 , you play @entity31 , who is part of a dwindling number of survivors living underneath a ruined @entity35			1
on the surface , animals and humans have been exposed to poisonous substances turning them into ravenous flesh - eating monsters			2
thankfully , @entity31 has an exotic array of improvised hand - made weapons at his disposal			2
developer 4a games have optimised their 4a engine , allowing it run faster than in its predecessor			0
the already eye - poppingly realistic textures have been made even more detailed , through the use of 2048x2048 textures , and geometric detail has improved through extra environmental and object - based tessellation			1
the @entity57 is one of the most powerful graphics cards in the world			1
the single - chip card uses the same technology behind the world 's fastest super computer			1
it has its own vapor chamber , allowing heat to escape and features a dynamic fan to prevent the card from overheating			0
similar to 2033 , @entity24 also features hardware - accelerated @entity71 effects			2
this allows for the realistic destruction of scene objects during combat , and the enhancement of other game elements , such as particle effects			0
it 's for these reasons that the developers recommend the game be played using either one of the two fastest graphics cards around , these being the @entity57 and the flagship gtx 690			1
no details have emerged yet on the optimum @entity88 equivalents			0
however , those with lesser cards can still enjoy the game , too - as ' optimum settings ' is likely to represent 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second			1
photorealistic ? @entity3 : last @entity24 features more open expanses than its claustrophobic predecessor - a likely reason behind the immense hardware demands on the mid-range to high @entity85 cards , for example the 670 or above , you 're likely to see the same graphical fidelity just at a lower frame rate - a spokesperson at @entity57 confirming to @entity106 that the game will still be ' very playable '			1
@entity24 will also support @entity108 , however , only the most powerful pcs will be able to run the game at its best using that display			2
although console owners will likely see a dip in visual quality , the @entity112 engine will squeeze every last drop of power from the aging @entity118 and @entity119			0
for more information visit : @entity121 @entity3 : last @entity24 is released on april 26			0
follow us on @entity123 : @ @entity124 and on @entity125 : @entity126 .			0

last light set to push pcs to limit with host of technology - *including* depth of field , tessellation and motion blur
although developers recommend @entity138 and @entity57 , @entity57 confirm game will be ' very playable ' on highest setting with lesser cards
