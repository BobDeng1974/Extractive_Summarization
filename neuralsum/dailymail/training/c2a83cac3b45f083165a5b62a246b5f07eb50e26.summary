by @entity0 @entity1 has said critics of his defence cuts , including outgoing deputy supreme commander of @entity6 sir @entity5 , are ' talking nonsense ' defence secretary @entity1 yesterday accused top generals of talking ‘ nonsense ’ , following a fresh warning that spending cuts are weakening the @entity12			1
in an interview yesterday general sir @entity5 warned that ministers were taking ‘ one hell of a risk ’ by replacing thousands of regular troops with part - time reservists			1
sir @entity5 , outgoing deputy supreme commander of @entity6 , said a series of cuts had left the @entity12 ‘ hollowed out ’			1
he said the @entity23 had been ‘ cut to the bone ’ , leaving it unable to take part in some @entity6 operations			2
his intervention is the latest in a series of warnings from senior military figures , both in this country and abroad			2
mr @entity1 insisted that the criticism was unfounded , pointing out that @entity33 still had the fourth largest defence budget in the world			1
he also revealed that @entity33 forces will be deployed on @entity6 war games in the @entity39 states to help ward off the threat posed by @entity41 in the wake of the @entity44 crisis			0
‘ nobody should be in any doubt of our resolve to live up to our commitments under the @entity6 treaty , ’ he said			0
asked if he was listening to the concerns of sir @entity5 and others he told the @entity54 ’s @entity53 : ‘ of course i ’m listening , and much of what i ’m hearing is nonsense			1
’ mr @entity1 said @entity33 remained a ‘ credible , capable and reliable ’ ally to the @entity58 , despite a recent warning from former @entity58 defence secretary @entity60 that defence cuts meant we could no longer be considered a ‘ full partner ’			1
‘ of course we have had to make savings , of course we have had to take some very tough decisions , ’ he said			0
mr @entity1 acknowledged concerns about cuts to the @entity23 , which have left @entity33 without an operational aircraft carrier until 2020			1
he said the @entity23 would ‘ like to have more assets ’ , but insisted it was still taking part in regular @entity6 operations			0
sir @entity5 ’s criticisms are the most outspoken yet by a serving senior military figure			1
although he stepped down from his @entity6 role at the end of last week he will remain the @entity79 ’s third most senior officer until he retires in august			0
the government plans to slash regular troop numbers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 and replace lost numbers with up to 35,000 reservists in an interview with the @entity85 he raised concerns about the government ’s controversial plan to slash regular troop numbers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020			1
the so - called @entity79 initiative involves trying to replace the lost capability by recruiting a 35,000 - strong force of reservists			1
over the same period , the @entity23 and the @entity93 are each preparing to lose 5,000 regulars and gain 500 reservists			2
sir @entity5 said it was still unclear whether the plan ‘ is going to work or not ’ and added that recruiting reservists on such a scale would require ‘ a complete shift in culture ’ among commanders			1
‘ it ’s certainly a hell of a risk , ’ he said			2
‘ the point at which a risk becomes a gamble is a subjective view			2
i think the jury is still out			0
’ but he reserved his biggest concerns for cuts to the @entity23			0
‘ a hollowed - out navy means you ca n’t project power , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve heard this said in the @entity117 , “ the yardstick by which we measure ourselves is our ability to punch above our weight ”			0
you ca n’t do that now			0
by that yardstick , therefore , we ’re failing			0
’ in a statement , the @entity117 said : ‘ with a restructured , more flexible and agile @entity79 and with £ 160billion planned on new equipment over the next decade , we will ensure our armed forces retain their formidable range of capabilities and ability to project power across the globe			0
