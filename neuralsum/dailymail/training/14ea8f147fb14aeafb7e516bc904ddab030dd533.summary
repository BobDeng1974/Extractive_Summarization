no government could refuse the challenge after the bloody provocations of @entity3			2
but having decided by a huge majority to embark on what @entity7 warned would be a long campaign , the @entity5 vote on friday did not make clear what the endgame would be			2
without knowing what victory will look like , have we embarked on a war we can not win ? our model of victory is what happened at the end of the @entity19 when the @entity20 successfully established democracy in defeated @entity22 and @entity23			1
the @entity39 thought it had kept @entity41 ’s promise to bring democracy to @entity26			2
but ‘ winner takes all ’ at the polls in countries riven by bitter religious rivalries means democracy has a sour taste for losers			2
things went wrong in @entity26 despite the presence of so many @entity52 and @entity53 troops and billions of dollars in aid , training and equipment			2
now @entity7 tells us to ‘ forget ’ the last @entity26 war			0
this time things will be different			1
just air power to back up local and regional allies who share our hostility to @entity34			1
that all seems straightforward enough			0
the enemy is obvious , almost a caricature of evil			0
but though knowing your enemy is vital in war , knowing what your allies ’ real aims are is equally @entity75 is our allies who frighten me almost as much as @entity34			1
on the ground , the @entity20 has friends who have daggers drawn with each other			0
and they have contempt for our values			0
even leaving aside the oil - rich @entity86 despots who have signed up for the @entity89 campaign for their own reasons , inside @entity91 , its key regional member , @entity93 , is not fully on board			0
@entity93 borders both @entity26 and @entity97 and has @entity91 ’s second - largest armed forces after @entity99 precisely because @entity93 is right in the thick of the @entity100 , its government has a very different take on the crisis			1
in @entity105 and @entity106 , the @entity103 of the region seem natural allies against the common @entity34 enemy			1
arming the @entity103 to fight the jihadis seems a neat way to get local boots to do the fighting on the ground in @entity26 and @entity97			0
@entity93 president @entity114 , seen right with @entity52 vice president @entity115 , has been a vocal critic of @entity116 and his open border policy to @entity97 has let foreign fighters , including hundreds from @entity53 , flow into the ranks of the jihadi forces but to @entity93 , @entity103 are not natural allies			1
with so many @entity103 people living in @entity93 itself , @entity122 fears arming @entity103 to fight is today will provide them with the weapons to fight for independence from @entity93 tomorrow			0
given how much expensive @entity52 weaponry fell into @entity34 hands earlier this year as the @entity128 disintegrated , is @entity93 unreasonable to harbour suspicions that defeat of is by the @entity103 @entity132 guerrillas could be the signal for a well - armed war for independence by its @entity103 ? but the @entity136 - led @entity93 government has been drifting away from the @entity20 in any case			1
president @entity114 has been a vocal critic of @entity116 and his open border policy to @entity97 has let foreign fighters , including hundreds from @entity53 , flow into the ranks of the jihadi forces fighting the @entity143 regime , but also taking @entity145 aid workers hostages			1
@entity97 ’s civil war is key to the crisis			0
but there , too , @entity145 values and the @entity20 ’s allies are in conflict			1
@entity151 and its @entity153 neighbours say they support the @entity52 - led alliance but they do n’t want the victory of @entity157			1
what we see as the best way to guarantee a future for peace and freedom , our @entity86 allies see as a mortal threat			1
the @entity167 fundamentalist monarchs tolerated their rich subjects funding is - style jihadis to fight @entity143 and other allies of @entity171 , which they hate and fear			1
@entity122 fears arming @entity103 to fight is today will provide them with the weapons to fight for independence from @entity93 tomorrow but when upstart jihadis like the self - proclaimed caliph , @entity178 , began to get too big for their boots , the ruling sheikhs were happy to join in cutting him down to size			0
but promoting democracy , human rights , respect for women and religious minorities are not their war aims			0
chaos breeds enemies like @entity34			1
it is not the solution			0
if anarchy is the problem , and democracy does n’t take root easily , is dictatorship the answer ? given how unsavoury and unreliable some of our allies in the @entity100 are , it is remarkable how reluctant @entity145 leaders have been to join up with the regimes of @entity97 or @entity171 , who have very good reasons of their own for hating and fearing @entity34			2
@entity7 , like @entity206 , has pronounced @entity143 beyond the pale			0
so it looks like the @entity20 is undertaking a three - sided war in the @entity100 , fighting @entity143 and his allies as well as his enemies			1
this may be consistent , but is it wise ? if the @entity20 is n’t prepared to cooperate with the forces fighting is in its main strongholds in @entity97 , then mission creep by our troops seems inevitable			2
a case exists for special forces operations against specific targets , like ‘ high value ’ is targets or safe houses where hostages are held			1
but large - scale deployment of @entity145 soldiers on the ground would be an admission of failure			0
this is a war which we can not win for the locals			0
maybe they ca n’t win it for themselves			0
barring a lucky strike which knocks out the @entity34 leadership and demoralises their supporters , air power is not going to produce rapid results			0
nobody should anticipate a victory in the @entity100 day 1945 - style			2
the crimes of @entity34 give us the right to fight it , but the war can not be won by the @entity20 without local support			0
tragically for us , the enemy and our dubious allies will decide the terms of victory or defeat .			1

our model of victory is what happened at the end of the @entity19
this time our allies and enemies will decide ' the terms of victory or defeat '
a case exists for special forces operations against top is targets
