@entity2 may have beaten his girlfriend with a cricket bat before shooting her , @entity1 police believe			1
detectives are reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the @entity9 champion ’s bedroom and to have established that model @entity11 ’s skull had been ‘ crushed ’			1
this and other evidence – a smashed bathroom door , a 9mm pistol , the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led them to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘ rock solid ’			0
police have rubbished speculation that @entity2 – who is known to have kept a pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder			1
prosecutors have formally charged @entity2 with premeditated murder but the @entity2 ’s family say he firmly denies such a charge			2
yesterday it emerged that he called his close friend @entity48 shortly after the killing – reportedly before the emergency services were alerted – and told him : ‘ there has been a terrible accident , i shot @entity11			1
’ mr @entity48 rushed to the house , where he said @entity2 repeatedly told him : ‘ my baba , i ’ve killed my baba			2
’ while no officials would comment publicly on the case , a disturbing – though disputed – picture of what may have happened in @entity2 ’s home started to emerge			1
@entity62 have said they heard shouting coming from the house at around 1.30am			0
there were some suggestions , quickly denied , that the row may have been about miss @entity11 ’s friendship with a rugby player			1
at around 3.20am , four shots rang out – apparently not all at once			0
the first person @entity2 called was his father @entity70 , 59			1
shock : @entity2 appears in court charged with premeditated murder , but says he killed his girlfriend accidentally after mistaking her for an intruder at his home when he arrived , he allegedly saw his son carrying his nightie - clad girlfriend down the stairs			1
she had been shot in the head , hip , arm and hand			0
@entity2 – and later paramedics – struggled in vain to save miss @entity11 ’s life			1
police reportedly found the bloodied cricket bat in the bedroom			1
the en - suite bathroom door was riddled with holes , a pistol holster was found by @entity2 ’s bed and a gun cartridge was on the floor			2
@entity1 ’s @entity96 quoted an unnamed police source as saying : ‘ the suspicion is that the first shot , in the bedroom , hit her in the hip			1
she then ran and locked herself in the toilet			0
‘ she was doubled over because of the pain			0
he fired three more shots			0
she probably covered her head , which is why the bullet also went through her hand			0
’ the source said police are carrying out tests to establish whose blood is on the bat			2
while one scenario is that @entity2 attacked @entity115 with the wooden bat , it has also been claimed that the model may have used it to defend herself			1
rugby star @entity120 's agent said the ' sad ordeal ' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the @entity127 's friendship with miss @entity11 a third possibility is that @entity2 used it to break down the bathroom door			1
those close to @entity2 have suggested that he may done so in a bid to ‘ save ’ his dying girlfriend			2
according to this theory , the athlete first shot @entity115 by accident , whereupon she fled to the bathroom			0
he then shot at the door lock to try to get in , accidentally killing her			0
@entity2 ’s father appeared to suggest it is this version that he believes			2
while he admitted that he had not talked to his son in detail about what happened , he said he had ‘ zero doubt ’ that the sportsman thought miss @entity11 was an intruder			1
a more likely defence from @entity2 is to acknowledge that there was a row but that he did not intend to kill her			0
@entity2 : @entity2 ran in both the @entity150 and @entity9 some in @entity1 have speculated about the nature of miss @entity11 ’s friendship with @entity127 rugby player @entity120 , and whether this played a part in the tragedy			1
the 24 - year - old was keen to distance himself from such reports at the weekend			0
his agent said : ‘ this whole sad ordeal has got nothing to do with him			0
’ last night @entity2 ’s agent said he had withdrawn him from all planned races but insisted his sponsors were sticking by him			2
the tragedy has also cast fresh light on @entity2 ’s apparent attraction to danger and weaponry			0
miss @entity11 's father @entity172 wept as he said he and his wife june were at ' a complete loss ' as well as owning a pistol and machine gun , at the time of miss @entity11 ’s death he reportedly had seven outstanding firearm licence applications			1
one was for same type of assault rifle used in the recent @entity182 in the @entity183			0
