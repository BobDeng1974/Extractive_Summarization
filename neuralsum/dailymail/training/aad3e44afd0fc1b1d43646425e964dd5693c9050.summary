@entity0 says that the latest figures show that welfare reforms are working the number of workless households has fallen by its sharpest rate since records began			1
there are now 3.3million homes in which no one has a job , a drop of more than 270,000 in a year and the biggest fall since 1996			1
however , it still means that one in six @entity15 households are unemployed			2
the fall in benefits - dependent families was heralded as a sign that the government ’s welfare reforms – designed to make it less lucrative to live off the state rather than find a job – were working			1
while overall 16 per cent of households have no adults working , this rises to 21 per cent in the @entity28			1
in the @entity30 , the figure is just 12 per cent			0
according to the @entity34 , the number of children living in workless households also fell by 132,000 from a year earlier , to 1.5million			1
this equates to one in eight children , compared to one in five almost 20 years ago			0
work and pensions secretary @entity0 said : ‘ there is no better example of welfare reform in action than giving children the economic security of living in a household where people are bringing home a regular pay packet			1
‘ my priority has always been to get people back to work who had been left behind – people for whom work was not part of their life			0
‘ these record figures show that not only are we successfully helping people to escape worklessness and turn their lives around , but we are also giving hope to the next generation			0
’ @entity63 households are defined as homes where no one aged 16 or over is employed , either because they can not or will not find a job , or because they are unable to work due to family or studying commitments , retirement , sickness or disability			1
the data showed that single parent households with dependent children were most likely to have no one in work			2
the level of workless households has fallen to 16 per cent , the lowest level since records began in 1996 married men , or men living with a partner , were the most likely to be employed			1
@entity85 , co-founder of jobseekers ’ website @entity83 , said : ‘ the jobs market has come on leaps and bounds			0
however , the headline numbers gloss over some subtleties of the recovery			0
‘ @entity94 parents with dependent children are still the least likely to be employed – more could still certainly be done to help single parents break back into the workforce			0
’ he also pointed out the regional variations , saying : ‘ the recovery is uneven throughout the country , with the proportion of workless households in the @entity28 remaining high			0
‘ areas like @entity103 are still in the first throes of recovery			0
there are still 11 jobseekers searching for every available role in the city			0
‘ compare this to cities like @entity112 , where vacancies outnumber jobseekers , and job - hunting in the @entity28 looks somewhat bleak			2
’ earlier this month , @entity34 data showed the biggest fall in @entity15 unemployment for 40 years			2
it fell by 538,000 in the past year , the largest drop since records began in 1972 , while employment rose to record levels of 30.7million .			1

in 16 *%* of homes no - one has a job , @entity34 says
