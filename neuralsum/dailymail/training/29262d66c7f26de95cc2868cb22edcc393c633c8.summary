what do dogs want , petting or being spoken to ? according to a study it ’s very much the former			1
scientists found that dogs had a preference for petting , whether it was from a stranger or from their owner			2
and it was found that dogs will only respond to vocal praise when they are very familiar with an owner and their voice			2
in the study they found dogs were more satisfied by physical contact			1
but they also found that dogs never tired of being petted			1
the results were true for dogs being petter by strangers and their owners the research was led by dr @entity34 from the @entity18			1
in the study , co-authored by dr @entity37 of @entity38 , the scientists examined a variety of dogs and their responses to situations			0
they looked at shelter dogs , owned dogs with strangers providing interactions and owned dogs with their owner providing interactions			0
scientists think they know why domestic species tend to have certain characteristics that accompany their tameness , such as floppier ears , patches of white fur , and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws			0
geneticists believe that a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest , link all these traits , which are seen in many people ’s pet cats and dogs			0
although the experts ' proposal has not yet been tested , it is the first hypothesis that connects several components of the ‘ domestication syndrome			0
’ it not only applies to mammals like dogs , foxes , pigs , horses , sheep and rabbits , but it may even explain similar changes in domesticated birds and fish , according to the study published in the journal @entity84			0
across all groups they found the dogs had a preference for petting over vocal praise			2
additionally they found that dogs never tired of being petted			1
when the dogs were petted they also preferred to stay in the proximity of the experimenter			2
but when only vocal praise was used they showed little proximity - seeking behaviour , on a similar level to when no interaction was initiated at all			0
‘ overall , petting seems to be an important interaction between dogs and humans that might maintain inter-specific social behavior but vocal praise likely has to be specifically conditioned , ’ the researchers write			0
previous research this year from the same two scientists , however , found that petting was n’t the be-all and end - all ; the animals actually preferred food to being touched			1
when food was readily available the dogs preferred to eat than be petted , and when access to food was limited the dogs showed ‘ sensitivity ’			1
‘ overall , petting seems to be an important interaction between dogs and humans that might maintain inter-specific social behavior but vocal praise likely has to be specifically conditioned , ’ the researchers write			0
in previous research they also found that dogs preferred food to petting			1
