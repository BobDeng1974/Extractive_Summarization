@entity0 admitted he was physically and mentally exhausted and in need of a holiday — but it may have to be a short one			1
the exertions of keeping @entity6 in the @entity7 and negotiating a route to the @entity10 final took a heavy toll on the former @entity13 centre back , who looked as if he had thrown himself into every header and tackle on saturday			1
it was an energy - sapping end to an afternoon which started high on promise but ultimately just failed to deliver			2
how close @entity0 ’s side came , though , thanks to the manager ’s canny tactical approach in the face of so many obstacles			1
dejected : @entity0 says there is no consolation in having contributed to a fantastic final salute : @entity0 acknowledges the fans , who gave him , and @entity6 , superb backing during , and after , the final beating relegation has already enhanced @entity0 ’s reputation this season , to the extent that most neutrals would have been rooting for his team at @entity38			1
pushing @entity39 all the way — despite missing @entity41 and @entity42 , both cup - tied — added another impressive bullet point to his managerial c.v			2
in the end , @entity6 surrendered an early 2 - 0 lead			1
they now face a fixture schedule that allows little scope for recharging batteries and will be a further test of @entity0 ’s management skills			1
after succumbing to @entity53 ’s extra-time winner , @entity6 will now enter next season ’s @entity54 at the third qualifying round stage on either july 29 or 30			1
it sent a shudder through @entity0 , who will start an urgent summer recruitment drive by trying to turn @entity64 midfielder @entity63 ’s loan move into a permanent deal for around £ 7million			1
‘ we ’ve got @entity69 football now , and we are going to have to try and enjoy it , ’ he said with a wry chuckle			2
‘ whether we ’ve got the resources and bank power , i ai n’t so sure			2
‘ there are all sorts of rules , and we ’ve only got 21 players to pick from at the moment			1
we ’ve got a game in july , and we will have played four times by the end of august , and i ’m not sure we ’re quite ready for that			1
@entity82 : @entity63 , who has been on loan from @entity64 , is a player @entity0 would like again next year watching on : @entity0 ( right ) can only watch as @entity39 start to celebrate at the final whistle break time : the @entity6 boss says he needs to take a break from football before planning for next season @entity6 will enter the @entity54 in the third qualifying round on july 31 along with @entity69 giants @entity91 and @entity92			1
their tie is unlikely to be glamorous though — they are likely to face the likes of @entity95 from @entity96 , @entity97 from @entity98 or @entity99 from @entity100			2
@entity64 , who finished sixth in the @entity7 , join a round a later for the play - offs while @entity104 join the competition in the group stages			0
as for lucky @entity13 , they can enjoy thursday nights free of the @entity54			1
mr @entity107 will be pleased			0
‘ i ’m completely gone , and need to get away , so i will tackle all that when i get back			0
but we have to make sure this is n’t the end of the story , after all we ’ve done and all we put into this final , and that is the challenge for us now			0
‘ how many players do we need ? certainly five or six			1
we landed two or three really big ones , like @entity117 and @entity63 — who we hope to secure as our player now after having him on loan			0
' but it ’s an ongoing process , and there are out - of - contract players to sort out as well			2
there ’s a lot to be done to make sure we are ready to go again , but i need a break first			0
i ’m absolutely b * * * * cksed ! ’ it is a quick turnaround for @entity0 , and other clubs ’ retained lists may prove required poolside reading at his holiday retreat , but his players are convinced he will come up with all the answers			1
their faith in him is unshakeable			0
‘ people go on about second - season syndrome in the @entity7 , but the gaffer will make sure we do n’t suffer from that , ’ said defender @entity136			1
‘ that ’s what he ’s paid for , and he has done really well in the last two transfer windows			0
faith : @entity146 ( left ) , who gave @entity6 the lead at @entity38 , trusts @entity0 to get it right again next season perfect start : @entity0 celebrates going in front at @entity38 , but @entity6 were unable to hang on against @entity39 ‘ he signed players who kept us up , and what we have achieved has to act as a springboard			1
there can be no going backwards , but there wo n’t be			0
' the gaffer wo n’t allow it.we all expect to see a few new faces when we return , and that ’s just what we need to cope with the extra demands next season			2
it is going to give everyone a lift			0
‘ getting something sorted out with @entity63 would be a good start			2
he ’s been massive for us			0
i ’d not seen a lot of him before , but once he came here , he hit it off straightaway			0
hopefully there ’s a deal to be done there			0
’ there is an uncomplicated bluntness about @entity0 that brings the best out of players who might not be automatic choices at other @entity7 clubs			1
they know where they stand and what is expected , and it shone through again , as he looked back on one of the most dramatic and enthralling finals of recent times			0
he could have taken comfort from his unfancied side running @entity39 so close and playing a full part in a two - hour classic that was compelling viewing even as late as the 116th minute , when substitute @entity196 reached the ball a split - second before @entity39 keeper @entity199 on the left touchline but steered his angled shot agonisingly wide of a gaping goal			0
in the final analysis , though , they fell short , and that was all that mattered			0
p * * * all : @entity0 says the medal he received from prince @entity208 for coming second is meaningless being able to hold heads high did n’t come close to atoning for not being able to lift the first trophy of his managerial career			1
asked if there might be a cup with his name on it one day , @entity0 replied : ‘ i thought it might have been this one			1
i could n’t have asked more of my players , and it looked like we might do it			2
it has taken me 16 years to get to this stage , but it was n’t to be			0
‘ to me , it ’s no consolation that we have contributed so much to a final that will live long in the memory			0
' it does n’t make it any better or easier to accept			0
there is no satisfaction in coming so close			0
it means p * * * - all			1
a loser ’s medal does n’t sit well with me			2

@entity0 says runners up medal ' means p * * * all '
@entity6 boss thinks they need five or six new players for next season
@entity247 *'s* @entity54 season will start in july
defender @entity136 *insists* club will avoid second season syndrome
