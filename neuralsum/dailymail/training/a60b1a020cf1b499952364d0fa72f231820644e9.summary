@entity1 manager @entity0 admits @entity3 counterpart @entity2 may sometimes be criticised for his methods but fans have to accept he ' guarantees ' results			1
this season @entity2 has added a more attacking element to his style to capitalise on the summer signings of @entity11 and @entity12 and that has taken the @entity3 into the top four			1
the former @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 boss has long been associated with a more direct brand of football which brought criticism from his own fans last season , when they finished 14th			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) is a results man , according to @entity1 manager @entity0 at the end of last season , @entity3 fans had lost patience with @entity2 , holding banners at matches however , that appears to have been forgotten as wins against defending champions @entity31 and runners - up @entity33 have helped the side into the @entity36 places			1
' @entity2 is a very experienced manager who has been in this league for a long time , ' said @entity0 ahead of their meeting at @entity41 on saturday			1
' he has been building clubs , coping with big expectations , but he always guarantees results			0
' what he has done with @entity3 this season is find a good balance of a side who can be difficult to play against but still really threaten in dead - ball situations but now they have brought in flair and players who can score goals out of nothing from open play and that is a really strong combination			1
' in football you make your own choices and decisions and there are many styles you can play and it is up to fans to like or dislike that			2
' winning is important ; for certain people in the game the only thing that matters is the result , for others who are a bit more romantic they appreciate more the way you win or the way you want to play than just the short - term result			0
@entity0 ( right ) believes it can be a very successful season for @entity3 , given their impressive start last time out , @entity1 's @entity81 ( centre ) scored a penalty as the @entity1 drew 1 - 1 at @entity84 ' i think it can be a really successful year for @entity3			1
' @entity0 's concern as his side return from the international break looking to build on seven points from their last three matches is a growing injury list			2
he has 10 players undergoing treatment at the moment , among them left - back @entity81 and midfielders @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
with @entity81 rated ' touch and go ' and @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 all out , it is likely @entity0 will have to tinker with his defence with @entity107 in line for his first @entity109 start after a one - minute debut as a substitute in april			2
' we have a large squad			0
i feel they are coping well with the demands we have this season , ' said the @entity118			0
@entity3 have had a brilliant start to the season , and sit fourth in the @entity109 table @entity12 ( left ) pictured scoring at @entity31 at @entity123 - @entity3 won the game 2 - 1 ' it is nothing different			2
the team is ready to adapt and cope with variations			0
' we have options ; @entity107 has been playing really well behind the scenes with the under - 21s			0
' at the other end of the scale former academy graduate @entity133 is set to make his 400th appearance for the club , joining just a dozen players , including the likes of @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , who have reached the landmark			1
' it is so difficult to find such a loyal footballer who can also cope with the demands of the modern game , ' said @entity0			2
' you need to swim against the current because there are so many forces taking you away from spending 10 years at one football club			0
' i think @entity133 and @entity153 are two big pillars for us in the way they have come through the academy , devoted their careers to the club and they are true @entity162			0
