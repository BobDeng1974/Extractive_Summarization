@entity2 's ' @entity1 ' , valued at about 6 million crowns ( £ 563,700 ) , was recovered by @entity12 , an art recovery specialist at the @entity14 in @entity15			1

once the match had been confirmed , mr @entity12 , executive director at the @entity14 , negotiated its safe return			1
' we are happy the painting seems to be okay and in good condition , ' said miss @entity18			0
' it was a good start to the @entity53			0
' mr @entity12 would not give details of how he got hold of the @entity2			0
' no arms were broken and no payments were made , ' he said , adding the painting would be returned to the museum through @entity5 's ministry of culture			0
mr @entity12 also hailed @entity61 , the director of the @entity3 in 1987 , who told reporters at the time the painting was too well known to sell on the open market			1
' i commend the museum for not giving in to ransom demands a quarter century ago , ' he said			0
' stolen artwork has no real value in the legitimate marketplace and will eventually resurface ... it 's just a matter of waiting it out			0
' rightful home : the painting was stolen from the @entity3 in may 1987 when a thief used a smashed his way into the museum in a nighttime raid , escaping moments with the canvas moments before security arrived the @entity14 claims to be the world ’s largest private database of lost and stolen art , antiques and collectables			1
art collectors , museums and galleries register the works in their possession with the @entity14 , and it works in concert with law enforcement agencies to find and recover any that are lost and stolen			1
it also offers art dealers a due diligence service which allows them to check whether works they have been asked to handle are in fact stolen			2

of the 360,000 objects remaining on the @entity14 's database , mr @entity12 said there were several he particularly wanted to find			2
the first is a hoard including paintings by @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 worth £ 185million stolen from the @entity156 in @entity157 in 1990			0
there is a £ 3million reward for the paintings			0
