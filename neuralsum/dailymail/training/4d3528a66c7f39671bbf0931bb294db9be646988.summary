sci - fi film @entity0 introduced the idea that large , vertical screens could one day be controlled using just gestures			2
but while the film was a work of fiction set 40 years in the future , a university in @entity6 has taken the technology one step closer to reality			0
the @entity14 features a tabletop , touchscreen display surround by a ' curtain of mist '			1
this curtain is made of fog screens that work in a similar way to touch displays , letting users move images around and manipulate their orientation within the smoke			1

these images can then be pushed through the fog screens and onto the tabletop display , where they are controlled using traditional touchscreen gestures			1
for example , a designer could rotate a virtual model , change its tilt and appearance on the fog screen before pushing it on the touchscreen and saving it			2

for example , a designer could rotate a virtual model and change it 's tilt and appearance on the fog screen before pushing it back onto the touchscreen to save or print it			2
alternatively , a group of people could work on the same design project by picking up various models and placing them on their personal fog screens			2
they could then each edit the individual parts before pushing them back onto the completed group image			0
@entity14 was created by professor @entity87 and dr @entity88 from the @entity29 's @entity89			2
these images can then be pushed through the fog screens and onto the tabletop display , where they are controlled using traditional touchscreen gestures			1
for example , a designer could rotate a virtual model , pictured , on the fog screen before pushing it on the touchscreen and saving it alternatively , a group of people could work on the same design project by picking up various models and placing them on their personal fog screens , pictured , and editing them before pushing them back onto the completed image as well as being ' reach - through ' , the screens are also see - through meaning users can see both the item the y are manipulating , as well as any relevant items on the touchscreen			1
the researchers said personal fog screens allow a range of ' customisations and novel interactions ' such as showing @entity120 personal content on the screen and 3d content above the tabletop			1
professor @entity87 added : ' @entity14 broadens the potential of conventional tables in many novel and unique ways			0
this diagram explains the different features of the @entity14			0
professor @entity87 from the university said the @entity14 could support new forms of interaction and collaboration in the future			0
the technology will be unveiled at the @entity138 international conference later this month ' the personal screen provides direct line of sight and access to the different interaction spaces			0
' users can be aware of each other 's actions and can easily switch between interacting with the personal screen to the tabletop surface or the interaction section			0
' this allows users to break in or out of shared tasks and switch between individual and group work			0

the *system* was developed by researchers at the @entity29
it features a tabletop , touchscreen display surrounded by a *‘* curtain of mist *’*
this mist is made of fog screens that act in a similar way to touchscreens
for example , items can be controlled and moved around the mist
pushing the item through the mist transfers it to the touchscreen display
