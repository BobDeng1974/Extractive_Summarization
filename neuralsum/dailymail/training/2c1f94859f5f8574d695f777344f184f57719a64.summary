by @entity0 an ancient @entity3 cave nearly the size of four football pitches and with its own underground lake may be responsible for sparking the age - old myth about the @entity3 underworld god @entity8 , archaeologists claim			1
the cavern - named @entity9 which means ' foxhole ' - laid undiscovered for centuries in @entity12 , @entity13 , southern @entity14 , until a man walking his dog found a tiny entrance to the cave in the 1950s			1
experts have spent the last few decades excavating the cave and believe hundreds of people lived inside @entity22 , making it one the oldest prehistoric villages in @entity25 , before the cave entrance collapsed burying everyone alive 5,000 years ago			2
he is a greedy god who is greatly concerned with increasing his subjects			0
he also presided over funeral rites and defended the right of the dead to due burial			0
as soon as he was born , @entity8 was devoured by @entity55 , the @entity57 god of time and the ages , along with four of his siblings			1
@entity61 later caused the @entity57 to disgorge them , and together they drove the @entity57 gods from heaven and locked them away in the pit of @entity65			0
when the victorious brothers then drew lots for the division of the cosmos , @entity8 received the third portion , the dark dismal realm of the underworld , as his domain			1
geographically , the underworld is surrounded by a series of rivers : the @entity77 ( river of woe ) , @entity80 ( river of lamentation ) , @entity83 ( river of fire ) , @entity86 ( river of unbreakable oath by which the gods swear ) , and @entity90 ( river of forgetfulness )			0
once across the rivers an adamantine gate , guarded by @entity94 , forms the entrance to the kingdom			0
archaeologists have now uncovered tools , pottery , obsidian , silver and copper artifacts that date back to the @entity104 , which began in @entity14 began around 9,000 years ago , soon before the @entity105			1
but the most important find - that the cave was used as a cemetery and for burial rituals - has led researchers to believe it could have inspired the legend of @entity8 ' underworld			1
the first archaeologist to ever dig inside @entity22 , @entity39 , suggests that the @entity104 residents believed the cave was @entity8			1
researcher @entity116 , an archaeologist at @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119 , told @entity120 : ' you can easily see why @entity39 would make that hypothesis			0
the cave really does recall the underworld , @entity8 and the @entity125			1
' @entity9 existed right before the @entity126 in @entity14 , so we 're kind of seeing the beginnings of things that produced the age of heroes in @entity14			2
' you have to imagine the place torchlit , filled with people lighting bonfires and burying the dead			0
' the burial sites and rituals that took place really do give the cave an underworld feel			2
it 's like @entity8 , complete with its own @entity125			2
hidden treasures : the cave in southern @entity14 remained hidden for centuries until it was discovered by a dog walker in the 1950s @entity149 graves : people apparently performed burials and spiritual rituals in the cave historical importance : experts believe the cave society dates back to the @entity104 - making it one of the oldest prehistoric villages in @entity25 ' @entity39 has always argued ... that the cave was a kind of pilgrimage site where important people were buried , leading to the fanciful idea that this was the original entrance to @entity8 , that it was the source of the @entity3 fascination with the underworld			1
' the cave is more than 1,000 metres long with a huge central chamber but the archaeologists still have a long way to go before they have explored the entire ruin			2
mr @entity116 added : ' we do n't know how much deeper deposits go			0
for all we know , we might have @entity172 down there			0
we just have n't dug deep enough to know			0
' on site : @entity38 co-directors @entity116 and @entity176 , of @entity177 , overlooking @entity12 where the cave is based in western @entity13 a lot to learn : researcher @entity180 analyzing deposits in the 1,000 metre long @entity182 clues : thousands of @entity104 pottery shards , which came from a variety of places , were excavated from @entity182			1

the cave - named *alepotrypa* - dates back to the @entity104 but laid undiscovered in southern @entity14 until the 1950s
archaeologists have uncovered tools , pottery , obsidian , silver and copper artifacts
findings suggest cave *dwellers* might have *connected* the cave with @entity8
