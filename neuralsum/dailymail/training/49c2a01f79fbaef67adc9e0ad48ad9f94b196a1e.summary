by @entity0 published : 15:53 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 16:03 est , 25 november 2013 a retired property mogul came close to losing out on a £ 5.5million tax break - because of his domestic goddess wife 's ' great cooking '			0
@entity5 insisted he was resident in @entity6 when he received a £ 29million dividend from selling off his family property portfolio			1
but @entity9 were equally adamant that his heart remained in @entity12 's prosperous @entity11 - where his wife , @entity14 , as well as being a high - powered charity chief , was legendary with family and friends for her sumptuous home cooking			0
the tax authorities cited the couple 's regular returns to @entity12 for @entity23 festivals and traditional friday night suppers with their grown - up children as evidence that they had never really left - and were thus subject to the full gamut of @entity30 taxes			1
plush : @entity33 , in @entity11 , @entity12 , where @entity9 claimed mr @entity5 actually lived and , as a result , owed millions in tax the couple spent about 200 days in @entity6 ( pictured ) during the tax year in question and mr @entity5 told the tribunal that , after his departure from @entity40 , @entity33 ' did not feel like home ' any more now , however , a tax tribunal has handed victory to mr @entity5 , 64 , ruling that he had truly made his home in the tax haven principality after more than 30 years managing the family 's £ 60million property empire - a task which he viewed as ' drudgery '			1
mr @entity5 - described as a thoughtful and ' not particularly extrovert ' man who ' devours ' reference books and loves playing @entity52 - found himself suddenly at the helm of the family 's business at just 21 when his father died prematurely			2
his ' meticulous and highly organised ' mind - when combined with the ' more extovert ' style of his wife and brother , @entity61 - led to phenomenal success for the family 's property business , the @entity65			0
the couple made their home in a splendid town house in exclusive @entity33 , @entity11 , filling it with furniture and fittings worth up to half - a - million pounds and bringing up their children , @entity74 and @entity75 , there			0
but , by 2005 , mr @entity5 had had enough			2
describing his daily work life as drudgery ' , he said he had never much liked his job and believed he had enough money to retire , said tribunal judge , @entity80			0
his brother set about selling off the family 's property holdings and , in may 2005 , mr @entity5 received a £ 29million dividend			1
mr @entity5 and his wife enjoyed watching the @entity86 and tennis tournaments in @entity6 , once sitting close to @entity88 in a restaurant			1
file pictures @entity9 said £ 5.5million in income tax was due on that bonanza but the judge said ' battle lines were drawn ' in a ' hard - fought ' case when mr @entity5 insisted he and his wife had moved to @entity6 in april 2005 and did not owe a penny			1
the tax authorities pointed to the couple 's fondness for their @entity12 home and continued close contact with their children and a large circle of friends as evidence that their hearts had remained in @entity11 and that they had never lost their @entity30 residence			1
@entity109 had only reluctantly given up her role as chairman of @entity23 charity - the @entity113 - and had had ' mixed feelings ' about leaving her home and following her husband to @entity6			0
@entity9 said the couple 's regular returns to @entity33 - so that mrs @entity109 could cook for friends and family on friday nights and @entity23 feast days - showed that , in their hearts , they had never left			0
the couple 's twin @entity124 cars had remained behind them in @entity12 and mr @entity5 had applied for a residents parking permit , confirming that he was resident in @entity33			1
however , judge @entity80 said the couple had bought two luxury flats in @entity6 and , although mr @entity5 returned to @entity30 22 times in the 2005/06 tax year , he had kept well below the 90 - day limit for overseas residency			1
the couple enjoyed visits from their children and friends , entertaining them at famous venues , including the top floor restaurant at the @entity140			0
file picture ruling that the couple had made ' a distinct break ' with @entity30 , the judge added that family and friends ' enjoyment of mrs @entity109 's culinary prowess was just one of a number of motives for their return trips to @entity12			1
friday night dinners were ' an ingrained feature of @entity23 family life ' and the judge observed : ' it seems odd to suppose that sustaining mr @entity5 's claim to have become @entity158 resident should require that the invariable @entity23 tradition should be abandoned or artificially restricted			1
' whilst they were ' very fond ' of @entity33 , mr @entity5 had genuinely sought a ' more relaxed lifestyle ' in @entity6 , losing two stone through a healthy exercise regime of walking and swimming , while his wife loved combing the food markets for delicacies			2
a lifelong migraine sufferer , mr @entity5 said he had never endured one since setting foot in @entity6 , where he and his wife enjoyed watching the @entity86 and tennis tournaments , once sitting close to @entity88 in a restaurant			2
mr @entity5 admitted that ' his lifestyle in @entity6 might be regarded by some as not terribly fulfilling '			2
but the judge added : ' however , not only was it what he wanted , and what totally suited his more solitary personality , but it was in some ways more fulfilling than many other ways of spending one 's early retirement			0
' the couple enjoyed visits from their children and friends , entertaining them at world famous venues , including the top floor restaurant at the @entity140 , and travelled frequently into @entity191 and @entity192			0
they spent about 200 days in the principality during the critical tax year and mr @entity5 told the tribunal that , after his departure from @entity40 , @entity33 ' did not feel like home ' any more			2
ruling that mr @entity5 had ' unquestionably acquired a habitual abode in @entity6 ' , the judge said he and his wife had enjoyed the affluent , sun - filled , lifestyle and had taken full advantage of the countless attractions ' the principality had to offer			1
they had intended to make @entity6 their ' home in every sense ' and had done so ' for various personal reasons , going well beyond merely camping abroad to avoid tax , ' the judge added			0
the tribunal heard that , after @entity75 gave birth to the couple 's grandchild in 2009 , mrs @entity109 was drawn more and more back to the @entity30 and the couple returned to @entity33 permanently in may 2010 .			0

@entity5 moved to @entity6 after a £ 29million dividend from family firm
but tax authorities claim mr @entity5 and wife never gave up @entity30 residency
they pointed to friday night dinners in @entity12 as evidence they had *n't* left
but judge said the couple had made a new life in @entity6
