by @entity1 reporter published : 16:34 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 07:30 est , 17 october 2013 @entity2 has posted its second - highest ever ratings - despite the new third season being widely criticized as ' confusing ' and a ' train wreck '			1
sunday night 's episode , @entity7 , which saw the return of @entity9 ( @entity10 ) averaged 1.81 million viewers for its 9pm episode - followed by a season best 2.62million for its three airings at 11pm and 1am on monday			1
and this made it the @entity19 drama 's second - largest audience for any night , behind only its second - season finale , according to @entity22			1
but despite the ratings , the tv hit has been castigated for its plotlines , which have so far seen errant @entity27 agent @entity26 ( @entity28 ) forcibly detained in a psychiatric unit - while her former lover sgt @entity9 was discovered in @entity30 , being kept in a prison of his own in an abandoned , half - finished skyscraper in @entity34 , referred to as the @entity7			2
why @entity35 ? homeland fans have taken their outrage for the teenage character 's attitude and general mopiness online and have called for her to be killed off the show following sunday 's episode , stars including @entity44 and actress @entity45 took to @entity47 to berate the show			1
@entity44 , 51 , tweeted : ' homeland tonight ... totally confused ' , while @entity50 , 37 , added : ' you guys ! what is going on with # homeland this season ? ! ' actress @entity56 added : ' homeland writers , how about we just have @entity26 take her meds , take over the @entity27 , annihilate @entity35 , and solve puzzles all day ? ' meanwhile , tv writer @entity61 said : ' still not sure where i stand on last night 's @entity2			1
i admired its quiet ambition but ca n't argue with folks who found it a little tedious			0
' another tweeter , @entity67 added : ' the # @entity69 have temporarily lost big screen privileges so i can catch up on last week 's @entity71			2
i 've traded one train wreck for another			1
' favorable father : @entity35 is less beloved than her father @entity9 , who is a terrorist while another viewer @entity77 ‏ tweeted : ' catching up on @entity2 ! @entity78 is still crazy , @entity9 is still confusing and the episode is going nowhere ! # ineedstufftohitthefanagain ' the @entity47 rampage comes after @entity2 fans spoke of their fury for @entity9 's daughter @entity35 - and the big role she took in the second episode			1
as @entity88 reported last week , the moody teen , played by @entity87 , has been a subject of ridicule in fan message boards and online ever since the show began two years ago , but her stock has gone down of late since she has been granted so much screen time in the new season 's first two episodes			1
adding to the virtual vitriol about @entity35 's prominent plot lines is the fact that her father was notably absent from the third season following the explosive finale this spring			2
rather than just making @entity105 scowls at their televisions , viewers took to @entity47 on sunday night to lament once more their hatred of the teenager who ( spoiler alert ) has recently come out of rehab following a suicide attempt			1
' why is @entity35 still on the tv , why @entity114 , ' @entity47 user @entity113 wrote			2
' i thought that # homeland people would have realized by now nobody likes dana , but no , they give her a storyline nobody cares about , ' fellow user @ rapturebus wrote			0
teenage angst : actress @entity87 , who plays @entity35 , said that she finds it funny how much time people dedicate to bashing her character online the decision to include the @entity9 family prominently - while leaving viewers in the dark about the whereabouts of @entity9 himself - was a conscious one for the creators			0
' there are all these families that are the victims of somebody in the family doing an act of violence			0
whether it ’s @entity141 , whether it ’s @entity142 , the @entity144 bombers , these people all have families who suffer the consequences of these psychopathic actions , ' show - runner @entity138 told @entity149			2
' it was interesting to think about what would happen to the @entity9 family			0
' screen time : the two episodes of season three of @entity2 have dedicated a good portion of the episodes to @entity35 's story line and her new romantic interest actress @entity87 , who plays the tortured teen , finds the attention paid to her character ’s moods and ticks funny - including the spoof that @entity164 did , where they played up her tendency to fiddle with her hands when feeling nervous			1
there are also similarities being drawn between @entity35 and the character of @entity170 from @entity171 , who was also the subject of scorn and the inspiration for hate - filled @entity176 groups			0
‘ characters are not always supposed to be loved			0
you could look at most characters and see mixed reactions			0
i do n’t take it personally			0
i think it ’s kind of interesting to see people , like , spending so much time focusing on something like that , ’ @entity87 said in an interview with @entity178 .			0
