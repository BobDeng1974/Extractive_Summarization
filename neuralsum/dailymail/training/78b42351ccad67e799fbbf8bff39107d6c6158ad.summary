@entity0 had the right idea - seat people on a round table and they are less likely to be argumentative and more likely to feel ' they belong ' , new research claims			1
but put them in rows , such as a row of candidates opposite @entity9 on @entity10 , and it is more likely to bring out a person 's ' individual ' streak			0
the findings could be useful for the layouts of classrooms , restaurants and hotel lobbies , said economic professors			1
strategic : @entity21 researchers found that people seated in a circular pattern were less likely to argue than those sat in a square or in a row it could even make the difference to the way people feel at events like weddings or in a meeting , said the study for the @entity34			1
@entity21 researchers sat volunteers around different shaped tables and analysed their reactions to a variety of advertising			1
they found that those seated in a circle or oval were more positive about adverts which conveyed groups - such as a family or a bunch of friends			2
those seated in angular arrangements , such as in a square or rectangle , identified more with those ads portraying individuals or mavericks			2
you 're fired ! : @entity10 's angular boardroom can set people up for confrontations and bring out a person 's ' maverick streak ' , according to researchers subconsciously , the style of seating brings out one of two conflicting attitudes , said the researchers from @entity66 and @entity68 universities			1
authors @entity69 and @entity70 wrote : ' the geometric shape of a seating arrangement can impact consumers by priming one of two fundamental needs - the need to belong or the need to be unique			0
' they added : ' seating arrangements influence consumers in a wide range of settings such as restaurants , hotel lobbies , public transit , or waiting areas in airports and doctors ' offices			0
' circular - shaped seating arrangements prime a need to belong while angular shaped seating arrangements prime a need to be unique			2
' @entity94 : the findings could have implications for businesses who hold regular meetings and want increase productivity and avoid confrontations between colleagues circular seating arrangements are often used on tv to convey a warmer , conversational approach , such as with football pundits on @entity107			1
@entity110 's guests , for instance , are sat together on a curved sofa and his chair is positioned as an extension of the same semi circle to produce a chatty , friendly show			0
but when @entity116 famously grilled an increasingly flustered @entity117 on @entity118 , they were positioned geometrically opposite each other			0
that interview is now famous for being confrontational with @entity116 asking the then @entity121 home secretary to repeatedly answer the same question he felt he was avoiding			0
on @entity10 , the candidates sit at one side of a long rectangle table and the panel led by @entity9 at the other , and the result is a lot more confrontational			0
the researchers added : ' the shape of a seating arrangement , a subtle environmental cue , can activate fundamental human needs , and these needs in turn affect consumer responses			2

@entity21 researchers found that sitting around a circular table made people feel as if they belonged to a group and in turn less argumentative
but angular tables made people show more *selfish* traits in a group
the findings could have implications for classrooms , boardrooms and even the humble dinner party
