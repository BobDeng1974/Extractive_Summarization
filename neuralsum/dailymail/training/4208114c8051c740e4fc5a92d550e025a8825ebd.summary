by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 12 november 2013 a new six - runway hub airport to the east of @entity3 could be built within seven years at a cost of £ 47.3billion			1
however , the ambitious plans would require the closure of @entity7 , which employs 76,000 people			1
the proposed new airport would sit on a purpose - built island off the @entity11 in @entity12 in the @entity13 , some 50 miles east of central @entity3 , and would be known as @entity14			1
soaring ambition : an artist 's impression of the £ 47.3bn @entity14 , which would be built on an artificial island in the @entity13 rivals : as a result of @entity23 's plans , @entity7 airport would likely have to close to accommodate the ambitious scheme the @entity26 government and business groups want to expand flights to fast - growing economies to ensure the @entity26 can tap into billions of pounds of trade opportunities			1
with @entity7 , @entity3 's biggest airport , operating at 99 per cent capacity , more runways are needed			1
however , the island airport has been criticised by environmental groups , who say the estuary is not just ' dead space waiting for development '			1
the proposal was released by @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , a consortium formed by @entity3 mayor @entity43 to address the capital 's air capacity crunch			1
the plan , to be launched on monday at the @entity47 , comes two years after architect @entity48 unveiled proposals for a four - runway hub in the @entity13 , backed by @entity43 and dubbed ' @entity14 '			2
the estuary airport is a passion project for mr @entity43 , who has blasted plans for a third - or even fourth - runway at @entity7			1
he said any expansion will ' consign millions of @entity56 to unacceptable levels of noise pollution ' , while a three - runway airport would be ' obsolete ' as soon as it was built			0
@entity23 said the new hub would have six runways and could be built within seven years without having to demolish houses or industrial infrastructure			0
it will also create 200,000 jobs			2
@entity23 said the new hub would have six runways and could be built within seven years without having to demolish houses or industrial infrastructure bold : an artist 's impression of the airport 's concourse ' this project avoids flying over densely populated areas of @entity3 and the south east , removing completely the noise contours and impact which have bedevilled millions of people throughout and around @entity3 over the past 40 years , ' a @entity41 spokeswoman said			1
@entity23 has proposed the @entity7 site is ' recycled ' into a new borough for @entity3 , creating housing and business opportunities			1
it added : ' under wartime legislation in 1944 , the village of @entity7 and valuable farmland was requisitioned for a new military airfield			0
' relocation and recycling the tightly constrained @entity7 airport site as a city extension for @entity3 , will allow a transformation of acres of runway concrete into a real piece of city , with the return of bio-diversity , in gardens , lakes and a landscape park system full of trees , birds and other wildlife			1
' proposed rail lines to link the airport to the capital , 50 miles away gateway : the @entity26 government and business groups want to expand flights to fast - growing economies to ensure the @entity26 can tap into billions of pounds of trade opportunities vast : the outline of @entity7 in red above , superimposed over @entity3			1
@entity23 calls @entity7 ' highly constrained and overloaded ' the @entity113 last year set up the @entity114 , chaired by @entity115 , to look into airport capacity in southern @entity117			2
it is due to publish a list of potential schemes by the end of this year with the final report due after the 2015 general election			0
earlier this year bosses at @entity7 , @entity125 and @entity127 airports urged the government to let them build additional runways to solve the capacity shortage , plans vigorously opposed by @entity43			2
he previously proposed a new four - runway hub should be built either east of central @entity3 on the @entity133 or further out in the @entity13 on an artificial island			1
in july mr @entity43 , said : ' this is further welcome argument in favour of the feasibility of having a new hub airport in the @entity13			2
officials at @entity7 ( pictured ) have vehemently opposed the plans , saying an extra runway is the solution to @entity26 's air capacity woes the scheme has attracted condemnation from a number of environmental groups , notably @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 @entity26			1
the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) has also dismissed the campaign and says the consortium has failed to address the ' considerable ' environmental issues			0
it said much of the estuary has international environmental protection and added that hundreds of thousands of birds use the estuary as a major migratory route , posing a considerable threat to planes from bird strike			0
@entity164 , the @entity151 ’s director for @entity117 said : ' @entity43 continues to pursue this pipe dream , but no amount of wishful thinking on his behalf changes the fact that the @entity13 is not dead space waiting for development			0
' it is home to an immense number of birds and other wildlife			0
you can not recreate the estuary nor move the native or migratory wildlife that relies on it for food and shelter			0
' i 'm sure the mayor does n't want to go down in history as the man who decimated not just birds in the @entity13 , but global species too , while putting air passengers lives at risk due to bird strike			0
' with so many options available for a multi-runway hub airport in a new location , it would be folly for the @entity114 to give countenance to the prospect of expanding @entity7 , the most noise - polluting airport in @entity200			2
' but @entity7 vehemently opposes the plans			2
in june @entity202 , ceo of @entity7 , said : ' @entity26 already has one of the world ’s most successful international hub airports in @entity7			0
' expanding @entity7 will put @entity26 ahead in the global race , connecting @entity26 business to growth more quickly and at less cost to the taxpayer than any other option for new capacity			0
' @entity7 is better located for passengers , business and jobs			0
why build from scratch at a new hub when we can build on the strength that already exists around @entity7 today ? '			0

the airport would sit on an artificial island 50 miles east of @entity3
it is a *pet* project for @entity3 mayor @entity43
plans would require the ' recycling ' of @entity7 into new @entity3 borough
the consortium claim 200,000 jobs will be created by ambitious project
@entity7 , which is pushing for extra runway , *strongly* opposes plan
environmental groups also claim airport will *devastate* region 's *ecology*
