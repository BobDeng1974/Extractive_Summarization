the mother of @entity3 shooter @entity1 is planning a memoir in which she will confront the ' indescribable grief and shame ' she has lived with since the 1999 tragedy			1
@entity7 said on tuesday that it had acquired a book by @entity9 , saying she was compelled to share her story after the murders at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , and other schools			1
the book is currently untitled and has no release date			1
@entity9 will donate any author profits to mental health research and charitable organizations			1
they killed 12 students and a teacher at @entity3 before taking their own lives @entity1 and fellow senior student @entity25 killed 12 students and one teacher and injured 26 others at the @entity34 school before taking their own lives in 1999			2
the large - scale attack also involved a fire bomb used to distract fire fighters			0
at the time , it was the worst school shooting in the country 's history before 2012 , when shooter @entity41 killed 20 students and six teaching staff at @entity12 in @entity14			1
@entity9 has previously described her feelings in an essay for @entity48 's @entity47 and in interviews for @entity51 's book , @entity50			1
mrs @entity9 and her husband @entity53 , have spoken little to the press following the @entity3 tragedy , the @entity52 reported in 2004 , but did not move or change their names			2
in her lengthy essay for @entity47 in 2009 , mrs @entity9 wrote : ' in the weeks and months that followed the killings , i was nearly insane with sorrow for the suffering my son had caused , and with grief for the child i had lost			2
' she continued : ' but while i perceived myself to be a victim of the tragedy , i did n't have the comfort of being perceived that way by most of the community			0
i was widely viewed as a perpetrator or at least an accomplice since i was the person who had raised a ' monster			0
'' mrs @entity9 also told author @entity51 : ' i can never decide whether it ’s worse to think your child was hardwired to be like this and that you could n’t have done anything , or to think he was a good person and something set this off in him			2
' @entity9 , the mother of @entity3 shooter @entity1 , is planning a memoir , @entity7 said on tuesday the killers ' diaries from the time offered chilling details about their activities in the months before the attack			1
they had ' to do ' lists , with each purchase of gasoline or a weapon marked off , and they had a hit list with at least 42 entries , all of them blacked out			0
on a calendar entry for april 20 , 1999 , the time 11.10 is at the top - an approximate reference to the time the attack began			0
elsewhere in the calendar are notations including ' get nails ' and ' get propane , fill my clips ' and ' finish fuses '			0
' once i finally start my killing , keep this in mind , there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who i do n't want to die , the rest must ( expletive ) die ! ' @entity25 wrote in a journal entry from october 1998 , six months before the attack			0
a scrawled entry in @entity9 's day planner apparently sketches out april 20 , 1999 , down to the minute , starting with a 6am meeting , a 10.30am ' set up , ' an 11.12am ' gear up ' and at 11.16am , ' hahaha			0
