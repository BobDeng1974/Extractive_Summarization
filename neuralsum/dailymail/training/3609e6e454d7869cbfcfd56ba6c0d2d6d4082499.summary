by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:04 pm on 21st june 2011 new details have emerged of how seriously the @entity4 government was bracing itself for a full scale nuclear crisis in the wake of @entity10 's @entity9 disaster			1
documents show how advisers rushed to work out how bad the crisis might get , and the plans drawn up for ' the worst case scenario ' to protect @entity4 citizens - including the @entity17 in @entity18 issuing iodine pills to expats and visitors in the capital and @entity23 , 70 miles from @entity9			0
the government 's emergency committee @entity24 were also on standby to screen passengers landing at @entity27 from @entity10 for radioactive contamination , it has been revealed			1
smoke is seen coming from the area of the no. 3 reactor of the @entity33 nuclear power plant in march a hydrogen explosion at the @entity9 power plant			0
@entity4 was bracing itself for ' the worst case scenario ' the tsunami - stricken @entity33 nuclear power plant heavily damaged by the earthquake and tsunami the experts were working on a ' reasonable worst case scenario ' with the plant releasing more radiation than @entity45 in 1986			1
the devastating 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck the east coast of @entity10 on march 11 unleashing a tsunami and then a nuclear nightmare centred on the nuclear plant of @entity9			0
an explosion knocked out cooling systems and backup diesel generators on march 12 , leading to explosions at three reactors and a fire at a fourth that was undergoing regular maintenance and was empty of fuel			0
the radiation leak sparked fears of full - scale nuclear disaster after some 28,000 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami and sixteen towns , 95,000 buildings and 23 railway stations were destroyed			2
the new details of @entity4 's contingency plans were revealed by the @entity69 following a @entity71 request			0
among the documents - prepared for sir @entity77 , chairman of the @entity78 for @entity79 ( @entity80 ) - was advice from the @entity82 on damage to the plant , public safety assessments from the @entity73 , ( @entity73 ) models of the radioactive plume			0
many documents were not released for fear they may impact on international relations , the newspaper revealed			2
a man is being tested for possible radiation exposure at an evacuation centre in @entity9			2
in @entity4 , experts were on standby to screen air passengers local residents of @entity97 village who lived within 20km area from the stricken nuclear power plant were evacuated to @entity102 city they do show , however , that advisers worked frantically to establish how bad the leak was in the first few days of the crisis , and feared that an explosion at one reactor or fuel pond could result in multiple explosions			0
they said ' the reasonable worst case scenario ' was if there was leaking radiation from six spent fuel ponds at the plant and all three reactors were damaged			2
they worked out that if this happened , 9.92 million terabecquerels of radiation could be been propelled into the air - almost double that released during the @entity45 in @entity121 in 1986			1
however , the accident was not expected to be as bad as @entity45			1
in march , radiation was detected across @entity4 , 5,500 miles away from the plant , in @entity125 and @entity126 - although experts said the levels were ' minuscule ' and posed no health risks to @entity4			2
on march 25 , the @entity73 drew up plans to screen air passengers arriving in the @entity4 from @entity10 in the event of a major leak in radiation			0
@entity4 's crisis plan was based on a scenario where almost double the amount of radiation was released into the air than the 1986 @entity45 power plant disaster , pictured @entity10 officials declared a 12 mile evacuation zone around the plant and another 140,000 living within 18 miles were told not to leave their homes , turn off their air conditioning and stop drinking tap water			1
@entity4 advised citizens to give the area a 30 mile berth and to leave @entity18 , 150 miles away			0
in april , @entity10 admitted that the spread of radiation was out of control and that the government had raised the crisis level to the worst on the international scale - level 7			1
@entity156 has only been applied to the @entity45 accident in the @entity158 in 1986 .			1

government braced itself for almost double the radiation released by @entity45
