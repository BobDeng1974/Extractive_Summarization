' mr @entity88 said @entity11 and @entity12 were arrested by police later that evening , but both denied deliberately causing mr @entity2 's death			1
' really , they were saying well , it must have been an accident , that he fell off the boat and somehow , and even though it was moving forward , he managed to get entangled at the back , ' he said			0
' the prosecution ’s case is that both defendants agreed that mr @entity2 should be run over by the boat and deliberately killed , and that each is guilty of murder			1
' @entity102 , who was at @entity17 with her family , spotted the speedboat in a broken state next to a groyne at the beach at around 9pm , said mr @entity88			2
@entity12 - who was covered in blood - was reportedly ‘ fiddling ’ with the propellor at the back of the boat for about 20 minutes			1

' once the boat had been tied up , mrs @entity130 saw what she believed to be a body in the water and said " oh my goodness , i think it ’s a body " , ' said mr @entity88			2
' the response from the man on the boat , @entity12 , was " oh , maybe it ’s a dummy "			2
' plainly he knew perfectly well it was not but far from calling for any help or acknowledging it was a body , his response was - " i think it ’s a dummy "			2
' mr @entity125 then called the police - prompting @entity12 to swear and say : ' what , the filth ? ' , the court heard			1
however , the defendant later apologised and explained that he had had ' a hell of a day '			0
@entity12 and @entity11 then abandoned the vessel and flagged down a taxi to take them back to the @entity153 van they had arrived in earlier , the court heard			1
@entity11 reportedly told the driver : ‘ yeah , we murder ’ , when asked about their day			1

the pair were arrested after driving back to the car park - where they had left a bag containing a bloody towel and a meat cleaver - at around 10pm			0
@entity11 , who had been driving , was more than 2.5 times over the drink drive limit , the court heard			2
mr @entity88 said : ' version one of @entity11 ’s story , which is absolutely untrue , was that he had driven forwards , @entity172 had fallen off the back and somehow become entangled in the propeller			2
' @entity179 experts say that really would not happen , but a moment ’s common sense would also demonstrate that			0
it is a complete lie			0
' both of the defendants confessed to killing mr @entity2 in bugged conversations while on police bail and showed ‘ callousness and indifference ’ , mr @entity88 said			1
he added : ' both were totally indifferent to the suffering they would have caused			0

in the recordings , he said : ' he was floating , floating like a hundred yards away			0
i turned around , went around him and said : ‘ you ’re not bullying any c * * * now are ya ? you ’re not bullying any c * * * now are ya ? ’ ' you got ta realise we ’re f * * * ing covered in blood , beat to f * * *			0
we were going round , there i was driving round , i said " you ’re not f * * * ing beating up c * * * s now are ya ? ' i honestly , mate , i just whacked the throttle down , whacked the throttle down and i ’m not remorseful			0

the anger came out and i let it take control			0
i keep getting nightmares since it happened , over and over again			0

' what ’s done is done			0
