by @entity1 reporter created 4:11 pm on 9th august 2011 some men may be more likely to riot because of their ' impulsive ' brains			0
certain individuals have lower levels of a brain chemical that helps keep behaviour under control , scientists believe			1
researchers from the @entity12 uncovered a link between impulsiveness and levels of the neurotransmitter @entity16 in a key brain region			1
do rioters , pictured looting a shop in @entity21 , have lower levels of a brain chemical that helps keep behaviour under control ? those with low levels tended to be more aggressive and to respond rashly to ' urges '			1
@entity16 is one of a family of brain chemicals that allow signals to flow between neurons			1
around 30 male university students had their levels of @entity16 measured using a specialised type of brain scan			1
they were also asked to complete questionnaires that assessed different aspects of impulsiveness , a trait known to influence self - control			2
participants with more gaba in the pre-frontal brain region had lower scores for ' urgency ' - the tendency to behave rashly in response to distress or strong emotions and urges			0
men with lower gaba levels had higher urgency ratings , making them more likely to act aggressively , drink and take drugs			0
the link with @entity16 was specific to the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex , a region critical to higher thinking functions			2
the research , funded by the @entity57 , is published in the journal @entity59			0
men with lower gaba - one of a family of brain chemicals that allow signals to flow between neurons - levels had higher urgency ratings , making them more likely to act aggressively , drink and take drugs lead scientist dr @entity66 said : ' what is clear is that the way people behave results from a complex interaction between a number of genetic , social and environmental factors			1
' what we 've found is that one of the reasons why some men act impulsively may be related to lower concentration of @entity16 in a specific part of men 's brains			1
' none of the undergraduates taking part in the study had any history of psychiatric disorders or substance dependence			0
the research helps to illustrate the role of basic brain physiology in controlling behaviour , said the scientists			2
' the ability to regulate our behaviour in response to a constantly changing physical and social world is key to adapted life , ' said dr boy			0
' failure in this finely - tuned mechanism is particularly important in most psychiatric disorders , where impulsiveness is the second most common symptom			0
' we hope this research will lead to further studies and help bridge the gap between recent genetic studies and imaging studies of psychiatric disorders			0
' further to publication of this article , researchers at the @entity12 have asked us to make clear that their findings – which related to how some people have lower levels of the brain chemical that keeps behaviour under control – made no mention of rioting			1
we are happy to make this clear .			2
