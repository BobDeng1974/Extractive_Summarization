in an effort to mark @entity3 , two @entity1 men have gotten their stomach into knots trying to speed eat a @entity1 food icon			1
unfortunately , the two men failed their first @entity9 attempt : downing a pretzel in 30 seconds without any water			0
however , a winner was eventually declared - one minute and 12 seconds later than his initial attempt target			1
after taking their seats , the two contestants chose their pretzels , rubbed off the salt and waited for the timer to start			0
realising the difficult task ahead , both men folded their pretzels - attempting to trick their minds into believing they only had half the amount in front of them left to eat			0
their mind trick did nâ€™t appear to help though , as neither men were quick to finish after the fold			0
struggling : @entity29 struggled to keep eating the pretzel , without any water , even after scraping off the salt and folding it in half eyes on the prize : @entity29 's fellow competitor could n't help but check how the eventual winner was getting along with the task at hand open wide ! before declaring him the winner , the official from @entity42 had to inspect that @entity29 had swallowed all of the pretzel eventually , after three attempts , @entity29 scored the @entity9 with his pretzel scoffing time of one minute and 42 seconds			1
the men attempted the feat to mark @entity3 on thursday at a shopping centre in @entity50 , outside @entity51 .			2

the two men first attempted to speed eat a pretzel in thirty seconds
