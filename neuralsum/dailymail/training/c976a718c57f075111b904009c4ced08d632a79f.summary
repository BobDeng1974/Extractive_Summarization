by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 02:15 est , 5 august 2013 the country 's 10 biggest water companies are the biggest polluters of rivers and beaches , it was reported today			1
but despite the water companies being responsible for more than 1,000 pollution incidents since 2005 , they have only been fined £ 3.5million			1
incidents include sewage pumping into harbours and rivers and pollution killing fish and wildlife			1
pollution : many @entity19 beaches , including @entity20 , failed to meet the minimum water quality standards set by the @entity22 last summer offences : the country 's 10 biggest water companies were responsible for more than 1,000 pollution incidents since 2005 , including into rivers and streams according to the data , obtained by @entity28 from the @entity29 under the @entity30 , only around a third of incidents led to a fine , with companies being cautioned for the others			1
the average fine was £ 10,800 - a pittance in comparison with the £ 10.5billion customers paid the water companies in 2010 - 11			1
an @entity29 spokesman said pollution could have a ' devastating effect on rivers , beaches , land , wildlife and , in the worst cases , communities '			2
@entity50 are concerned the penalties for pollution are too small to encourage the water companies to act to prevent it			1
@entity55 mp , chair of the @entity56 , told @entity28 : ' in law , the " polluter pays " principle is supposed to deter companies from damaging the environment , but in this case the penalties appear to be so pitiful that water companies seem to be accepting them as the price of doing business			1
' while @entity67 mp , deputy leader of the @entity68 , told the newspaper : ' these figures are another indictment of the failings of our privatised water companies in @entity75			1
many of them make large profits , pay huge dividends , increase prices and pay little tax			0
when , in addition , these figures show they do n't deliver clean water , the public is entitled to say that our monopoly water providers are neither good corporate citizens nor good stewards of our precious environmental assets			2
' the @entity91 for @entity75 and @entity92 proposed increasing fines depending on the size of the company earlier this year			2
its consultation into the level of fines for water companies recommended setting the standard fine for deliberate instances of pollution at £ 750,000 , with the option of changing it for £ 270,000 to £ 2million depending on the nature of the offence			1
costs : much of @entity19 's sewerage system is still based on @entity110 infrastructure which takes millions of pounds to maintain but water companies strongly denied they saw fines as a normal part of doing business			1
@entity115 was the most frequently punished company with 242 offences since 2005 , including one fine of £ 200,000 for 22 incidents of sewage leaking into the @entity120 , in @entity121			2
a spokesman for the company said : ' to claim that @entity115 are content to continue to pay fines and accept cautions , rather than improve our performance is completely inaccurate and very damaging			2
in our case , the number of incidents is declining overall			0
' the number of occasions when we have been fined has dropped since 2005			0
the instances actually went down year - on - year , five years out of nine			0
so to suggest we ‘ accept the fine and carry on ’ is plainly absurd			0
' we ’re not denying we have very occasional problems , and every incident of pollution is one too many for us			0
but the trend for @entity115 has been one of improvement			0
' @entity143 received the largest fines over the period - a total of £ 842,500 for 87 incidents			2
it said it was not in its interests to simply accept fines and cautions and carry on regardless because the cost of clearing up pollution - which is the responsibility of the water companies - can be ' enormous '			1
@entity157 was the third most fined company , and its offences included one incident where a works manager ordered the destruction and falsification of records			0
fines : @entity165 , whose @entity167 sewage works site is pictured , was the most heavily fined company works : the water companies insist accepting pollution because of small fines is not in their interests as they have to pay for repair and clean - up costs it said it recognised ' there is still more work to do ' but added that within the next two years it will have spent £ 2.3billion on maintaining and upgrading infrastructure , including 40,000 miles of sewerage pipes			1
a spokesman for @entity184 , which represents water companies , said : ' the water industry takes its responsibilities to the natural environment very seriously and any incident that has had a negative impact is deeply regrettable			1
' we never want to see incidents of pollution			2
the significant environmental and social implications , in addition to the unpredictable burden on resources following an incident , mean it is in no one ’s interest to pay fines and accept cautions			0
' water companies invest billions of pounds each year to safeguard the natural environment while providing people with high quality , healthy water to drink and healthy rivers , beaches and bathing waters to enjoy			1
' while it ’s widely accepted there is still room for improvement , there is clear evidence of progress in many areas with the number of pollution incidents reducing year - on - year and growing investment in a number of initiatives to protect and nurture the natural environment			2
' an @entity29 worker treats the @entity227 at @entity228 , @entity229 , after it was contaminated with untreated sewage and cyanide a major river was polluted after poisonous cyanide it contaminated sewage treatment works			0
thousands of fish were killed after part - treated sewage , with contained traces of the cyanide , leaked into the @entity227 in @entity229			0
the incident began after cyanide entered a sewage treatment works in @entity241 through the pipe network			0
it killed the bacteria used in the sewage treatment process with the result that partially - treated effluent was discharged into the river			0
this contained ' one part in a million ' of cyanide as well as ammonia , said a spokesman for the @entity29 following the incident three years ago			0
the public were warned to stay away from the river as officials tried to trace where the cyanide had come from .			0
