by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 07:51 est , 11 january 2013 an international surf firm has come to the rescue of a featherless penguin by creating him a designer wetsuit			2
bald humboldt penguin @entity6 , 14 , was at risk of sunburn after all his body feathers fell out in just one day - rather than the usual few weeks of moulting			1
with nothing to protect him from the weather , the two - foot - tall bird faced a depressing three weeks indoors as he waited for them to grow back			1
custom fit : international surf firm @entity17 came to the rescue by making @entity6 his own wetsuit unusual : @entity6 lost all his feathers in a single day instead of the usual few weeks , leaving him at risk great outdoors : instead of a miserable three weeks indoors , @entity6 is splashing around thanks to his wetsuit it would have meant staying away from his friends , partner , and young chicks at @entity30 , near @entity31 , @entity32			1
but @entity33 - based @entity17 has given @entity6 a sponsorship deal - usually reserved for international surf and snowboarding stars			1
the firm has made a warm and protective wetsuit that offers a snug custom - measured fit and includes holes for his head and wings			2
@entity6 is now swimming , eating , and playing with the other penguins as usual			1
the rubber wetsuit is extremely flexible and does not restrict his movement			0
it even has his name on the back in large white print			0
it was made from the leg of a suit donated by a member of park staff , but three years of swimming and grooming took its toll , leaving it ' tatty ' , freyed at the edges and coming apart at the seams			0
' the warm and protective wetsuit offers a snug custom - measured fit and includes holes for his wings ' show off : @entity6 is the envy of his fellow humboldt penguins thanks to his new designer gear protection : keepers had thought about covering @entity6 in suncream but feared it would quickly come off special customer : the water - loving mammal has been given a sponsorship deal usually reserved for surf stars his keepers put out an appeal for a new suit and were delighted when @entity17 heard of his plight and responded			1
@entity80 , from @entity30 , said : ' @entity6 was in desperate need of a new wetsuit as his old one was starting to fall apart			1
' his wetsuits see a lot of activity with him constantly on the go , swimming , climbing rocks and preening			0
' he certainly looks the part with his custom made @entity17 wetsuit			2
' he has been preening his wetsuit just as he would if he had feathers and his partner @entity96 has joined in too			0
' @entity80 added : ' @entity6 is a very healthy bird , but for some reason his feathers drop out very quickly , before the new feathers grow back in time			2
comfortable : the 14 - year - old penguin has been preening the wetsuit just as he would if he had feathers bite to eat : @entity30 keepers say @entity6 is constantly on the go - swimming , climbing and preening watchful eye : every year is different for @entity6 , with keepers never sure when he will lose his feathers ' every year is different for @entity6 and we can never be sure when he will lose his feathers but as soon as he starts looking bald we put the wetsuit on him			1
' @entity6 has had a wetsuit before so he is used to wearing them and acts just like any other penguin in the colony			1
' when penguins moult over a period of around three weeks every year their old feathers are replaced with a new , clean set.but @entity6 has baffled keepers by losing all his feathers in just one day , leaving him strangely bald apart from his head			1
keepers initially thought about covering the bird in suncream but reasoned it would quickly come off in the water			0
the suit has the added benefit of keeping him warm on cold nights			0
visitors are already flocking in to his enclosure to see @entity6 parading around in his special gear			2
@entity133 : the wetsuit has the added benefit of keeping @entity135 during cold nights @entity137 attraction : visitors are already flocking to see @entity6 and his wetsuit at the @entity32 park generous gift : ' it was an absolute pleasure for us to provide @entity6 with a new wetsuit ' @entity144 , from @entity17 , said : ' it was an absolute pleasure for us to provide @entity6 with a new wetsuit			1
' in celebration we would like to invite him onto the @entity17 team			2
after all , he is the ultimate coldwater specialist			0
' @entity151 penguins live along the coasts of @entity153 and @entity154 within the reaches of the @entity156			0
it is a cold current of water running from the @entity159 to the equator , from which they take their name			0
@entity151 penguins are thought to be declining in number , possibly due to increasing water temperatures and reducing food supply			0
they can live up to 30 years in captivity .			0

the humboldt penguin moulted in one day instead of the usually few weeks
@entity6 was at risk of sunburn and faced a depressing three weeks indoors
but he is outdoors enjoying life at @entity30 , @entity32 , thanks to @entity17
