by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 13:08 est , 18 june 2013 a woman trying to live on nothing but water for up to six months is calling it quits after 47 days			1
@entity5 , 65 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , stopped eating on may 3 in a bid to explore breatharianism - the concept that food is not necessary and sunlight provides all of the nourishment the body needs			1
but on sunday she announced via @entity14 and @entity15 that she is ending the extreme self - experiment because she has realized that it 's ' totally dangerous ' and likely to cause death			1
she continued : ' somebody doing this without all of that in place is synonymous to watching a tightrope walker high in the air , admiring them and thinking you can do it too			2
' now that i see all that feedback , i am really seeing that it is totally dangerous ' ' if i got up there and tried to copy them , the result would be instant death			2
' ms @entity5 will ' slowly ' resume eating on june 19			1
in 45 days she has lost 20per cent of her body weight , taking her five - foot four - inch frame down from 159 to 126 pounds			1
other than water she has also been drinking tea with a ' splash of milk ' and recently started taking daily vitamin supplements			1
dr @entity50 explains in the @entity51 the length of survival without food is influenced by factors such as body weight , other health considerations and , most importantly , the presence or absence of dehydration			1
unlike total starvation , near - total starvation with continued hydration has occurred frequently , both in history - during famines , for example - and in patients under medical supervision			1
a q&a section on @entity71 's @entity70 website explains that after one day without food , the body will have used up its carbohydrates			1
after that , it 's on to the fat reserves			1
the average person apparently has enough fat reserves to live for four to six weeks without food			0
from there the body begins to use its protein reserves - basically , the body itself - which causes irreparable damage to vital organs including the brain			1
it states that on average people can last for about eight weeks on water alone , give or take about a week for an over or underweight person , respectively			0
unpleasant side effects of her no - food diet have included ' sensations of bile ' at the back of her throat , sickness , nausea and constipation			2
it also impacted on her social life			0
on day seven she wrote : ' my friends had a barbeque tonight ! i could not actually smell it but i could hear them all having a good time			0
they did send me their love but no steak ! ' food is such a social connection that to give up the addiction to food also requires learning how to interact in a non-food situation			0
' imagine going to a wedding or a party or a buffet and not eating ! i do n’t even want to think of it ! ' confined to the same four walls , ms @entity5 has been filling her time with movies , exercise and sleep			1
in one of her video entries she claimed she felt ' very well ' and only occasionally experienced ' twinges of what feels like hunger '			2
however , now she days that negative public reaction has caused her to reconsider what she is doing			2
' there are a lot of people who are genuinely concerned for safety and genuinely do n't think it 's possible and believe it to be dangerous , ' she said on sunday			2
' now that i see all that feedback , i am really seeing that it is totally dangerous			0
' under surveillance : the retiree installed security cameras around her home to prove she did n't sneak snacks doctors have warned that it is not possible for humans to photosynthesize , and four deaths have been linked to people who apparently had tried			0
too extreme : ms @entity5 set out to survive on nothing but water for six months another motivating factor for ending the experiment , says ms @entity5 , is that she ’s out of money			1
originally she hoped publicizing her efforts through social media would help keep her financially afloat , but to date she has only received $ 425 in contributions via her website			0
for the experiment she maxed out her credit cards buying equipment such as eight security cameras			0
she had them installed in her small trailer to prove she was n’t sneaking snacks			0
the last day she ate solid food was on april 30			0
she then embarked on a three - day juice cleanse and underwent colonics in preparation for the prolonged fast			2
as for her first meal , she told the @entity177 it will consist of ‘ lemon juice for vitamin c and a spoonful of maple syrup in warm water for energy ’			0
she will then move on to liquidy vegetables such as spinach or zucchini sautéed in water			0
' there are thought to be more than 5,000 breatharianists and light nutritionists worldwide .			0

in 45 days @entity192 has lost 20per cent of her body weight , taking her five - foot four - inch frame down from 159 to 126 pounds
