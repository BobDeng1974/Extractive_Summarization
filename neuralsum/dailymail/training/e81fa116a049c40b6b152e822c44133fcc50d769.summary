angry @entity0 ordered @entity3 chief @entity2 to leave @entity4 after a furious showdown over the decision to make @entity9 federalist @entity8 the new president of the @entity10			1
@entity11 mr @entity2 was summarily led to the @entity13 door after the men clashed in the ornate @entity15 over mr @entity0 ’s claim former @entity18 prime minister @entity8 ’s appointment spells disaster for @entity20 – and @entity21			1
tempers flared at mr @entity0 ’s determination to expose u-turns by mr @entity2 , @entity26 leader @entity25 , @entity28 ’s @entity27 and @entity30 ’s @entity29 on mr @entity8			1
in a last - minute gambit , mr @entity0 told mr @entity2 at the @entity4 meeting on monday that he intended to demand a formal vote on mr @entity8 ’s appointment , to shame the ‘ @entity8 turncoats ’ – as one @entity20 diplomat called them – at friday ’s summit in @entity41 where the final decision was taken			1
mr @entity0 was convinced that mr @entity2 , the chairman of the @entity61 , planned to nod it through with @entity47 in a bogus attempt to claim the @entity3 was united			1
if @entity0 needed inspiration to give mr @entity2 a @entity66 - style @entity65 , he had chosen the right setting for their meeting			1
two against one : @entity0 thought that he had @entity71 and @entity25 onside in his battle against @entity8 only for them to turn on him the @entity74 was redecorated in @entity76 style on the personal orders of @entity66 when she was in @entity4			1
@entity0 fixed mr @entity2 with a @entity79 - style glare as they sat opposite each other on opposing cream sofas			1
‘ if it is to be @entity8 , i insist on a formal vote , ’ said @entity0			2
mr @entity2 blinked : ‘ i will decide how the vote is conducted			2
’ mr @entity0 : ‘ you must guarantee there will be a proper vote			1
’ mr @entity2 : ‘ i have said i will decide that			2
’ mr @entity0 ’s face flushed with frustration : ‘ i do n’t want you saying “ anyone who agrees with @entity0 raise your hands ? ” after i have spoken			1
i want a vote , and the names recorded			0
’ still , mr @entity2 sat on the fence			2
mr @entity0 finally snapped : ‘ if you wo n’t give me that assurance , there is no point in continuing this meeting			1
’ mr @entity2 glanced at his chief of staff , sitting next to him , then across to mr @entity0 , and finally at the floor			1
thrown out : mr @entity2 was described by @entity106 's leader @entity105 as having ' all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low - grade bank clerk ' mr @entity0 leapt to his feet and motioned that the meeting was over			1
he led mr @entity113 to @entity4 ’s famous black door where they shook hands and said goodbye with the minimum of degree of cordiality needed to observe diplomatic protocol			0
but it did not mask the truth : mr @entity2 , cruelly described by @entity106 ’s leader @entity105 as having ‘ all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low - grade bank clerk , ’ had been thrown out in all but name			2
by the time mr @entity0 arrived for an @entity3 leaders ’ dinner at the historic @entity127 in @entity11 on thursday , to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the @entity129 , he knew he had lost the ‘ @entity130 ’			1
other @entity3 leaders , and @entity47 in particular , feared embarrassing headlines of ‘ @entity133 ’			1
they need n’t have worried : mr @entity0 made a tactical , and diplomatic retreat			2
‘ i am not going to cause a fuss			0
it is an important moment in the history of @entity21 and we must honour it properly , ’ he said			0
in reality , he had little ammunition left			0
afterwards , his limousine took him direct to @entity41 , where he talked late into the night with the @entity20 ’s envoy to the @entity3 , @entity144 , to discuss his tactics for the crunch meeting on @entity8 at the @entity61 ’s ‘ @entity151 ’ hq , named after a 16th - century @entity41 philosopher who advocated the virtues of constancy			2
it was a trait the prime minister found hard to identify as he surveyed the 27 others leader sitting around him on the 80th floor			0
he eyeballed each and every one of them : the ones who had told him mr @entity8 was ‘ too federalist ’ , who told him in hushed tones he ‘ drinks a little too much ’ , who told him mr @entity8 was ‘ lazy ’			1
in return , he told them why they would live to regret abandoning the traditional power of elected @entity3 leaders to block the appointment of an @entity10 president if it was against a vital national interest			1
under the new , and suitably teutonic titled ‘ spitzenkandidaten ’ ( @entity26 for frontrunners ) rule , parties in the @entity3 parliaments choose the candidates			0
@entity26 speaking mr @entity8 was the ‘ spitzenkandidat ’ of the @entity181 , even though it has less than one in three of the total number of @entity178 – and none from the @entity20			2
mr @entity0 did not mince his words : ‘ some people are bringing the @entity3 into disrepute by saying one thing in public and another in private			1
let me tell you bluntly , you will regret this			0
@entity20 has a problem with mr @entity8 because of his federalist views			1
he does not mean anything to people in @entity20			0
they do n’t know him			0
how could they ? he has never campaigned there , ’ he added caustically			0
‘ this time it is our problem			0
but next time , it will be you			0
anyone round this table who has a strong objection to an @entity3 president will be trapped			2
by giving away the power of leaders to defend their national interests you , too , will be powerless to act			0
’ and he went round the room , picking off his targets			0
looking towards the leaders of the three former @entity210 @entity209 , @entity211 , @entity33 and @entity212 , he said : ‘ our protection for you is taken for granted , but another president could disagree			0
’ he moved on to @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			0
‘ we put your interests ahead of those of @entity221 , but what if a spitzenkandidat president thinks that trade deals with @entity221 are more important ? ’ continuing his virtual tour of the @entity3 southwards , he said : ‘ @entity226 has remained in the @entity227 , but what if a future president wants them out ? they ’d be stuck			0
’ the economies of @entity30 and @entity233 could suffer if a new president wanted to change the ‘ growth and stability pact ’ which stops debt - ridden @entity3 countries going broke			0
‘ @entity239 has exceptionally low corporation taxes			0
what will you do if a new spitzenkandidat president says you ca n’t have them ? ‘ the fundamental principle of the @entity3 is the democratically elected leaders of the member states have the right to decide these issues			2
in making mr @entity8 president , you are going back on all of that			1
‘ the @entity10 is becoming the creature of the parliament			0

@entity255 throws @entity10 president @entity2 out of 10 @entity13 in row over new president
several @entity3 leaders told mr @entity0 privately they thought @entity8 not up to the job
in public they changed their views and backed mr @entity8
mr @entity8 , *59* , has been *dogged* by *rumours* of a drink problem for years
