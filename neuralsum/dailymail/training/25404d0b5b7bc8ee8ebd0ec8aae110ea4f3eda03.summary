by @entity0 for the @entity1 they came to @entity3 from their native @entity4 in search of new lives			1
@entity7 and @entity8 met , married , started a family and began a successful restaurant business			1
but six decades on from the day they set foot in the capital , mrs @entity11 would become a tragic victim of the other side of @entity17 , horrifically slaughtered in her garden by a machete - wielding killer			1
her daughter @entity41 told the @entity1 : ‘ it ’s just the most horrendous thing to do to another human being			1
we simply ca n’t make any sense of it			1
’ mrs @entity11 arrived in @entity17 from southern @entity4 in the 1950s and immediately found a job as a nanny			1
@entity22 had travelled separately to @entity48 but knew he had found his future wife from the moment he first saw her			2
together they saved enough money to fulfil a dream of starting their own business and raised @entity29 and a son , @entity30 , making sure they immersed themselves in @entity58 culture without forgetting their @entity4 roots			1
they ran a succession of cafes and snack bars in different parts of the city before settling in @entity3			1
tributes : tributes gathered outside one of the @entity3 snack bars which had been run by the 82 - year - old mr @entity8 died in 2008 but in @entity72 , the family continued the business with @entity74 building up a solid base of regular customers who enjoyed mrs @entity11 ’s friendliness as much as her food			1
she had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe that she and her son ran in @entity83 , a few minutes walk from her home			2
known there as @entity86 , she had become a much loved and familiar face , gradually handing over the running to @entity30 , now 53 , after her husband died			2

‘ she was a very nice lady , and she would n’t give up working			0
we would joke that i could n’t understand her after 35 years because of her strong @entity4 accent			1
’ @entity122 , 44 , a worker at a @entity83 florist , said : ‘ she was a very friendly lady			0
she was lovely really , like a lovely grandma			0
’ by last night the cafe had become a focal point for tributes , a carpet of flowers and wreaths growing in front of the shuttered doors			2
most were left by shocked friends , customers and nearby local businesses , one describing her as ‘ a truly wonderful lady ’			0
another encapsulated local anger and grief in six poignant words : ‘ one more angel taken , ’ it said			0

‘ he was always down , he never smiled , he never had any money			0
he was a known failure			0
’ another friend said : ‘ he is from a @entity171 background but he is not a good @entity171 – he gambles , plays roulette			0
