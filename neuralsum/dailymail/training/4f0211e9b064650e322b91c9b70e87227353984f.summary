an @entity1 man looking to exact revenge on the worst car he has ever owned is offering - up the demolished product on @entity5			1
@entity6 , who set about on a mission to destroy his @entity8 earlier this year , has less than two months until he and some complete strangers smash it to smithereens			2
after four years of fruitless car dealer and court negotiations , the @entity12 revealed that mr @entity6 had decided to take the less orthodox approach of smashing the $ 49,000 vehicle to pieces			1
now , in another twist to his ambitious bid to send a message to @entity21 , he is selling the wrecked heap on @entity5			1
an auger will start the demolition process by drilling a ' sunroof ' into the top of the dodgy jeep there are plans to also set the car on fire - but mr @entity24 has assured it will be done in the safety of 4 hectares of private property once mr @entity24 has destroyed the car - he will get rid of the scrap heap on @entity5 a hammer and crow bar will be among the tools used in the destruction of the jeep listed under ' cars , @entity44 ' is the details of the very frank and forthright ad , which according to mr @entity24 , does not hide any nasty secrets - unlike the @entity50 dealer who sold it to him			1
' destroy my jeep - you 're buying the wreck , ' the ad says , with a description that reads : ' we are about to totally destroy our $ 49,000 2010 @entity59 , as we refuse to pretend everything is ok and sell this onto someone else , so you are bidding on the wreck ! ' mr @entity6 is well into a second @entity65 campaign to re-coup some of the cost of the $ 49,000 vehicle , after the first one failed to raise the $ 22,500 amount @entity21 offered to him to buyback the car			1
he has since dropped the price to $ 18,500 and those who donate will have the chance to be involved in the car 's destruction			1
the ad continues : ' we intend on hitting it with hammers , shooting arrows into it , smashing out headlights , windows and mirrors			2
' ' @entity85 comes the 34 - tonne excavators that will have a drill attachment fitted to drill a 2 - foot - wide ' sunroof ' into the top and another large hole in the back to pin down the car , while another excavator fitted with a claw ' removes ' the engine by tearing it out through the front grill			2
people have 53 days to pledge their cash to smash the jeep which has been the bane of mr @entity24 's existence ever since he drove it out of its @entity50 dealership			2
once finished , the pieces will be sold - off on @entity5 where the bidding for the scrap heap has already begun			2
mr @entity6 is hoping that people will pay for the fun of destroying his car , which he says is ' cursed ' and a ' lemon ' so far there has been 57 bids for the demolished product and there have been 65 pledges for people to help him show the vehicle who is boss			1
' i do n't know who or why would want to bid on it			2
. maybe @entity21 are bidding for it and trying to bury it , ' mr @entity24 told @entity120			0
he said there is a point to his particularly crazy idea			0
' there 's two things , ' he said			0
' i do n't want to have to sell this car to somewhere else , because that 's not fair , and i ca n't afford to just tear it apart and lose $ 28,000			2
' he has already paid off about half the cost of the original price			0
the other reason - he hopes the demolition job will raise awareness to change consumer law in @entity1 and send a message to @entity21 about its dodgy dealings			0
for $ 12 supporters can have their name written in permanent marker on the car before it is smashed up , $ 22 will buy someone a go at the car with a sledge hammer , $ 250 will enable someone to destroy the engine and $ 5,000 grants someone the right to set fire to the jeep at the end of the process			1
the car is now littered in signatures from the people who have pledged money			2
everyone , providing it is within reason , will get to choose their weapon of choice			0
mr @entity24 needs to raise another $ 13,000 in 53 days on @entity65 before the @entity150 gets demolished among the more outlandish requests to demolish the car include parking it on a rifle range and firing bullets at it , and using an auger to drill a hole through the car 's roof			1
the second request , mr @entity24 has accepted			0
' it is a machinery company and they are providing the equipment to smash it , ' he said			0
' so we will begin with an auger drilling a hole through the roof of the car			0
' mr @entity6 insists he has never driven the car off - road and that it has only done 12,000km less than the average four - wheel - drive for its age			1
mr @entity6 said he is taking extreme measures after years of frustration with his ' cursed ' @entity8 , which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 has had all number of problems , including the fuel line falling off , coolant leaks , the rear strut leaking oil , ongoing ignition failure , and the turbo inlet manifold cracking			1
' things happen with cars , but you should n't have 20 things wrong with it , requiring four tow trucks and a push [ when the car broke down before he even got it out of the showroom ] , ' he told @entity120			0
mr @entity6 said he ' tried everything possible the right way ' to get a resolution from @entity21 , contacting the dealer , importer , @entity211 and the @entity212			1
mr @entity6 said he wanted to shoot the jeep with guns but that 's illegal in @entity1 and so people will have to settle for bow and arrow assaults on the vehicle the @entity221 project was started after mr @entity6 felt he had exhausted all formal options of communication with @entity21 @entity21 offered mr @entity6 a settlement of $ 22,500 for the car , for which he originally paid $ 49,000 , and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $ 28,000 for it , but he says he feels uncomfortable with both options			1
' it 's become a matter of principle for me , if i take their money , they 're going to on - sell the car at a profit and someone 's going to end up with my lemon and i just do n't think that 's right			0
' i might as well try and find some lighter side to the whole thing			0
' the @entity65 campaign is a way of doing just that , as well as putting pressure on big companies who think they can bully unhappy customers into giving up , he said			1
' i 'm just really disappointed in their lack of want to resolve this issue and i certainly tried all the formal ways to resolve this			0
' i guess in this day and age of social media it puts pressure on companies to do the right thing by their customers and i 'm really hoping they review their policies			0
' mr @entity6 adds that he has ' never done anything like this before ' and does not think all jeeps are faulty			1
' i do n't think it 's all @entity150 , it 's just there 's something systemically wrong with this one			0
' once the destruction of the @entity150 has taken place , mr @entity6 says he just wants to put this chapter behind him			1
he will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he 'll purchase he does know one thing			0
' it wo n't be a jeep			0

@entity6 started a @entity65 campaign to get people involved in destroying his car

the price is at $ 1200 , 57 people have bid and *thousands* more are watching
requests include shooting bullets at the vehicle on a rifle range
