the former @entity1 @entity0 is pressing for rules to be relaxed so that clergy can report serious crimes such as child abuse for centuries the secrecy of the confessional has been sacrosanct , but the @entity8 may relax the rules to allow clergy to reveal serious crimes such as child abuse			1
former @entity1 @entity0 – who last year led an inquiry into clerical sex abuse in the @entity8 – is pressing for the changes , along with members of the @entity8 ’s ‘ parliament ’ , the @entity15			1
but any change will be fiercely resisted by traditionalists who think clergy should retain the trust of worshippers			2
it will also cause tensions with @entity23 , who believe the seal of the confessional should remain inviolable			0
@entity28 ’s moves follow a decision by the @entity30 to allow its priests to report crimes they hear during confession to the police			1
the sacrament of penance , in which a believer privately confesses their sins to a priest , is usually associated with the @entity23			0
however about a quarter of the @entity8 ’s clergy hear confessions – usually face to face in a private room rather than in a booth in a church			1
the archbishop of canterbury @entity47 last year urged more @entity49 to adopt the practice , saying the experience could be ‘ enormously powerful ’			0
however @entity28 , whose report for @entity47 led to an apology by the church to victims , said : ‘ it is very important that anything criminal that involves the abuse of people should not be protected			0
’ he said the @entity8 had to ensure any reforms were workable , but the @entity54 had provided ‘ a very good model ’			2
for more than 400 years clergy have been banned under @entity8 law from disclosing ‘ secret and hidden sins ’ revealed by penitents , including criminal offences			1
but in july the @entity15 of the @entity30 voted to allow clergy to go to the police if the person who confessed refused to do so , saying the safety of victims must be paramount			1
these crimes include child abuse , child pornography or other offences that would lead to a jail term of five years or more			1
dioceses in @entity79 are expected to introduce the changes by the end of the year			0
and the @entity82 , a member of the @entity8 ’s @entity15 , has tabled a motion calling for @entity8 law to be amended so priests are no longer compelled to keep confessions of abuse confidential			1
the issue could be raised at the next @entity15 meeting in november , as bishops brace themselves for tough questioning from a @entity92 inquiry into abuse in institutions including the @entity8			2
a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ the guidelines for clergy are being considered for debate in november at @entity15			2
the @entity79 model is one of a number of options which will be considered as part of the ongoing discussions			0
’ however one senior synod member said : ‘ if we go down the @entity79 route we have destroyed the priesthood			0
you should be able to go to a priest and tell them everything			0
this is the @entity23 tradition and we have always followed it			0
if we did something different now it would upset everybody			0
’ and the @entity115 of @entity116 and @entity118 @entity117 said a @entity8 rule change could put pressure on the @entity23 to do the same , but added : ‘ we will never relax the absolute requirement of confidentiality			1
