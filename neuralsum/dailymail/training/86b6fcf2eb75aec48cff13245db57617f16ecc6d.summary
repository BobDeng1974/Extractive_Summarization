@entity0 is the 30th @entity1 player to have left the club on loan this season alone			1
he is perhaps the club ’s brightest prospect in years and could now spend the rest of this campaign at @entity8 in the championship			1
there have been some dissenting voices at the @entity12 ’ use of the system , with the staggering statistics used as a stick to beat the big spenders with			1
thirty this season , and similar numbers in each of the last three , too			1
the first is to allow the real talents to hone their skills in lower divisions in a bid to hit the ground running on arrival back at @entity58			1
the second is to merely push players into the shop window ; those who will not make it into the club ’s first - team squad , but who could happily carve careers for themselves in @entity67 , the @entity68 or lower reaches of the @entity70			0
@entity21 can not escape the fact that the only player of genuine title - winning pedigree to break through from the academy over the last 15 years is @entity28			1
but now he believes they have a cluster ready to make the big time			0
the manager said at the start of the season that he would have failed should @entity0 , @entity82 and @entity83 do n’t find themselves @entity85 players in the future			1
@entity88 have taken @entity90 's brother @entity89 on loan for the campaign @entity93 has not done featured regularly for @entity94 while @entity95 ( right ) has been in @entity96 he also spoke about the academy structure at @entity1 last month			1
' if you do n't bring kids through the academy , the best thing is to close the academy , ’ he said			1
‘ if the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough , and you do n't bring kids up , then close the door and use the money to buy players			0
‘ you need to prove the academy works well and is worth it			1
‘ for the first time i have been at @entity1 there is a clear group of four or five players between 17 and 20 clearly identified that we know — unless something happens inside their heads — that have to be @entity1 players			1

@entity0 – @entity8 ( youth loan - could end season ) @entity164 's ( left ) performances for @entity165 have seen him move on loan to @entity166 @entity144 signed for @entity145 ( left ) with @entity123 at @entity124 until the end of the season @entity151 is trying to make a further name for himself while at @entity178 ' @entity152 @entity147 ( left , playing for @entity124 ) and @entity167 ( for @entity168 ) are both loaned for the season @entity153 has struggled to make his mark at @entity1 but is plying his trade at @entity154 in @entity182 @entity161 ( pictured in the summer ) is at @entity162 , while @entity163 played for @entity34 at @entity183 @entity184 ( centre , playing for @entity186 ) is currently on loan with @entity188 @entity138 spent time at @entity139 earlier this year before a switch to @entity140 ‘ if , in a few years , @entity0 , @entity82 and @entity83 are not national team players , i should blame myself			1
’ @entity0 is the first of the clutch – that includes @entity193 - to depart temporarily , and will learn his craft in the second tier			1
@entity1 see this as key in their players ’ development and offers an indication as to whether they will sink or swim when asked to make the step up			1
past experiences dictates that more than a few could fail , however			0
big things were expected of @entity45 , for example , but his floundering in the @entity68 meant he is extremely unlikely ever to play at @entity207 again			0
the game time their crop of young talent is currently garnering should stand them in good stead to make a run at the first team ; and if not , to impact on other @entity70 clubs further down the line			0
@entity42 perhaps wo n’t provide much competition for @entity219 or @entity220 as a central striker , but – given his prowess for @entity224 last year and @entity34 this – should find he enjoys a career in the top flight			0
but then there are the likes of @entity37 who is at @entity230 side @entity39 , even though the central defender so impressed at the back end of last season			0
looking back to last year , the central midfielder @entity234 formed part of @entity237 's midfield who passed their way out of @entity67 and earned a permanent move to @entity241 on the back of it			0
while he never played for the @entity1 senior team , they should consider that a job well done			1
central midfielders @entity142 ( left ) and @entity157 have been at @entity143 and @entity158 respectively @entity156 was loaned to @entity31 but has since joined boyhood club @entity248 big things are expected of @entity132 ( at @entity124 , left )			0
@entity130 joined @entity250 side @entity131 @entity129 celebrates scoring for @entity124 during the @entity253 @entity252 match against @entity254 @entity134 has formed part of @entity135 's back four and @entity136 is at @entity137 ( right ) there are too many who fall by the wayside , though			1
@entity47 nor @entity263 did n't fancy him last year and - despite being given chances at @entity261 and @entity34 - he has now been farmed out to the club 's partner team @entity124			0
@entity136 has jumped from club to club , too			0
the man whose transfer in 2009 cost @entity1 more than a few headaches needs to kick on but they have afforded him ample opportunity			1
now at @entity137 , his time is now			0
@entity21 just hopes that the alarming lack of academy products playing for @entity1 will change			1
@entity276 - @entity275 the imposing box - to - box midfielder made his first - team debut against @entity279 last month			0
seen as the one of the club ’s top prospects , the 17 - year - old stands at 6ft 4in and is able to dominate a game with his physical presence and range of passing			0
@entity0 dubbed the academy ’s successor to @entity290 , @entity0 appeared for @entity1 in last season ’s @entity291 and is the current @entity85 under 20 captain			1
a bustling midfielder with a lethal eye for goal , the 19 - year - old will be eager to try his hand in the @entity68 with @entity8			0
@entity299 frequently the shining light in games well above his age group , the diminutive attacking midfielder is the focal point of the @entity305 attacking play			0
able to fearlessly run at defenders and possessing a great finish , at just 18 @entity309 is one of the jewels in the academy crown			0
@entity138 having lost his way at @entity139 in the first half of the season , @entity138 has a chance to be a vital part of high - flying @entity140 ’s promotion push from @entity67			0
with an accomplished creative eye and a composure on the ball that belies his 19 years , @entity138 provided the craft to @entity0 ’s hustle for last season ’s youth side			1
@entity82 snapped up from @entity326 in 2013 , striker @entity82 has been tipped for @entity85 stardom by @entity21			0
helping @entity85 win last summer ’s under 17 @entity68 , @entity82 ’s hold - up play , technique , speed and finishing ability means he is adept across the front line			0

@entity0 is the 30th player to leave @entity1 on loan this season
over the last 15 years , @entity28 is @entity1 's only real academy success
@entity0 has joined @entity25 wednesday on a youth loan
@entity1 have used the system to their *advantage* in the past
