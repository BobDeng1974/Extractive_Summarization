by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter a last - minute change avoided what could have been an uncomfortable moment in the september 11 museum dedication ceremony : @entity8 governor @entity7 followed by ' @entity9			2
' the original program for the ceremony had @entity7 's remarks followed by @entity14 's performance of the song			1
that sent social media aflutter with speculation that the scheduling was a jab at the governor over accusations that his staff intentionally clogged traffic near the @entity25 to punish a political adversary			0
in her place , fellow @entity38 singer @entity41 , herself a 9/11 widow , performed ' @entity43			1
' the spokesman said the change had nothing to do with @entity7 or the song			0
the @entity49 song has been referenced numerous times to skewer @entity7 over the ' bridgegate ' scandal			2
the @entity52 strongly maintains he never had any knowledge that the bridge closing was orchestrated by staffers in his own office - and certainly never ordered the closing			0
however , the scandal damaged @entity7 's brand			1
he had been considered an early front - runner for the 2016 @entity52 presidential nomination before @entity64			0
now , his name comes up in conversation considerably less			0
9/11 window @entity41 performs ' @entity43 ' after @entity7 's speech - thus avoiding the ' @entity9 ' flap			1

singer @entity14 was set to perform the song - which some saw as a *job* at @entity7 's ' @entity64 ' scandal
she *canceled* the appearance *wednesday* night , saying she had a cold
9/11 widow @entity41 performed ' @entity43 ' instead
