@entity0 left @entity2 supporters in no doubt about the relationship breakdown between the club and wantaway midfielder @entity6			1
manager @entity0 did n't mince his words in branding the player a ' sick - note ' and revealed that he 's asked @entity6 to leave @entity10 without @entity11 paying up the remainder of his one - year contract			1
but @entity0 asserts that while the 24 - year - old wants to depart , he is sitting on his contract and wants a pay - off			2
@entity2 manager @entity0 did n't hold back when talking about wantaway midfielder @entity6 marrow ( right ) wants to leave the club and has made just four appearances for @entity11 this season @entity2 currently sit just above the @entity23 relegation zone in 22nd position , having won seven and drawn three of their 24 league games this season			1
the @entity29 were knocked out in the first round of both the @entity31 and the @entity32			2
@entity11 reached the second round of the @entity34 and were beaten on penalties by @entity36			0
@entity6 returned to the @entity23 strugglers this week after being absent for a month with illness			1
' @entity6 is back with us after his sick note period expired , ' @entity0 said			1
' the situation with him is that @entity6 wants to leave the football club			1
i also want @entity6 to leave the football club			1
' we 're going through a process of finding the best way for him to leave the club which is financially beneficial to both parties			0
' fortunately for @entity6 , while he is here , and does n't want to be here , he still gets paid			2
unfortunately for me while @entity6 is here , and does n't want to be here , i 've still got to pay him			2
' i 've asked @entity6 to leave and not take the money he 's owed			1
that has been my negotiating strategy			0
we 've obviously hit a stumbling block on that			0
@entity0 gives instructions to his players during a match against @entity61 last month ' in the short term , the beauty of what we 've got with working for a very honourable football club is that we will continue to pay @entity6 for his services , even though he does n't want to be here			1
' marrow has only played four league games since a free transfer from @entity70 in the summer			1
meanwhile , winger @entity71 - who has been absent from the club to ' refocus his mind ' - was also the subject of some straight talking from @entity0			0
' i did n't ask him to go away , ' @entity0 added			2
' being completely honest , @entity71 was n't happy , but nor was i. and usually when there 's two unhappy people , there needs to be a separation			0
@entity71 in action for @entity2 during a pre-season friendly against @entity84 last july ' we 're both unhappy about the same things			0
@entity71 's unhappy because he 's not playing , and i was unhappy because @entity71 was n't playing			0
and i know the reasons why @entity71 was n't playing			0
' he 's not in my thoughts for the weekend because he 's not fit			0
' @entity11 face consecutive relegations if they can not arrest a slump in form which sees them just two points off the bottom two in the basement division .			0
