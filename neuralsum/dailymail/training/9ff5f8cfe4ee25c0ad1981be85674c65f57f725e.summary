the victim had been awarded £ 40,000 in damages from his previous employers after he was fired over false claims he made inappropriate advances towards a woman			1
suffering marriage problems after having a stroke , the unnamed man eventually found casual work in a furniture business with close friend @entity1			1
but when he told @entity1 about the ordeal , his new boss devised a series of scams to steal the money - including a bizarre ' kiss and tell ' threat			2
father - of - three @entity1 , 50 , recruited a friend to pose as the victim 's former colleague and told her to demand £ 10,000 - or she would expose their ' liaison '			1
in a hand - written contract that he was forced to sign , the woman made false claims the victim had groped her breasts			1
the man was said to have felt ' backed into a corner ' and agreed to pay the cash			0
today , @entity1 , who has not repaid the victim , was jailed for three years after he admitted fraud and blackmail at @entity42 's @entity41			0
the court heard how the victim , from the @entity45 area of @entity46 , confided in @entity1 about asking a former colleague to go for a drink in what was described as ' inappropriate circumstances '			1
he then told him about a ' settlement fee ' of £ 40,000 he received from his former employer			1
in september 2011 , the victim was called by a woman who claimed to be the same woman he was accused of inappropriately approaching through work			0
she demanded £ 10,000 from him and threatened to ' tell her story ' to a newspaper and make false accusations of sexual assault if he failed to pay			2
the distressed victim told @entity1 about the threat - but the boss falsely said his business had also received a phone call from the same woman			1
@entity1 falsely told the victim that his solicitor had advised him that the allegations could be so damaging that the furniture company would be shut down			1
the victim felt backed into a corner so agreed to pay the money			0
kiss and tell : @entity1 offered to take the victim 's money and give it to ' the woman '			2
he returned with this receipt @entity1 then told the man he would take the money to the woman , and returned with a handwritten statement to confirm she had received the payment			2
it read : ' this payment is for harassment and sexual advances			0
touching my breasts , we will have no contact with anyone or speak to anyone about this matter			0
this is the end of the matter			0
' in early 2012 year , the victim gave £ 13,000 to @entity1 , who told him about an investment where specialist furniture could be bought from @entity101 and sold for ' handsome profit ' in the @entity103			1
when he was then told by @entity105 that a return on the furniture investment had been ' delayed ' , the victim became suspicious and contacted the police in may 2012			2
it emerged he had also paid @entity105 a further £ 2,000 after he falsely claimed he could get a quick sale for his house through a property firm			1
in court @entity1 claimed he was ' deeply remorseful			0
' but judge @entity114 told @entity1 : ' these were extremely serious and particularly mean offences			0
' after the case , pc @entity117 of @entity119 said : ' the victim considered @entity1 to be a friend , but now we know that he was manipulating this man for financial gain			2
' over a period of time , @entity1 took complete advantage of the trust that had been placed in him , seizing on the victim ’s vulnerabilities			0
' these vulnerabilities included a sense of distress and embarrassment at the way in which he left his job , and that became the fuel for this man to become a victim of blackmail			0
' @entity1 has now been put behind bars for his dishonesty and i hope that this gives the victim some closure so he can take steps to rebuild his life			0
