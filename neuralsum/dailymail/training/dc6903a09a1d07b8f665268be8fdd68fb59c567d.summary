swooping from the sky , all synwell the lonely bird of prey really wants is to find a mate			1
but being one of the world ’s biggest and most powerful owls , with a 5ft 6in wingspan and talons like scalpels , his advances might seem a little forceful			2
woefully misguided too , as unfortunate victims of the eagle owl ’s indiscriminate love bombing in a @entity15 market town can testify only too well			1
take @entity16 , 70 , a retired nurse who ended up with a broken arm after she caught @entity19 ’s enormous orange eyes one night when she tried to photograph him perched on a lamppost , hooting			1
synwell the owl has been swooping down on frightened residents in @entity24 in his search for a mate			1
left , he lands on @entity29 in his garden and right , @entity16 , whose arm was broken by his wings ‘ he was making such a noise , so i went outside and shone my torch on him to try to get a picture , ’ she said			1
‘ he did n’t seem to like that			0
he drew his wings up and took off – flying straight at me			0
’ she tried to run back to her house but while dodging the bird , which stands over 2ft tall and weighs as much as a small dog , she tripped and fractured her right forearm as she broke her fall			1
‘ if he was being romantic , he should have gone to @entity43			0
i had no time to run from him , he just dive - bombed me			1
he ’s certainly got no fear of humans , ’ she said			0
it is the latest in a series of incidents in @entity49 , @entity50 , involving @entity19 , who was named after an area of the town by locals			1
@entity55 , 74 , has been swooped on in the street , and her husband @entity57 , 66 , was targeted outside their home			1
mr @entity60 said : ‘ we were so shocked by the incident that my wife wo n’t go outside the house now without taking an umbrella for defence			1
if he comes at you , there can be no warning			0
’ despite his misadventures , @entity19 has become so popular since he took up residence two years ago that residents have created a @entity75 page for him to record sightings , incidents and photographs – and he has amassed 457 followers			1
of course , some ca n’t resist posting updates about the twit - twooer on @entity83 too			2
@entity85 owls are found all over @entity86 , but are rarely seen in @entity87			0
they have been known in captivity in this country since at least the 17th century , says the @entity91 , and remain popular with falconers and collectors			0
the owl perched atop a tree in the @entity50 village			2
@entity19 has left other residents with claw marks on their foreheads and in fear of being swooped upon but dozens of eagle owls , which feed on small mammals but can be trained to kill foxes , escape every year			1
@entity19 has tags on his legs and is thought to have been born in captivity before escaping or being abandoned			0
experts say that explains why he seems so eager to get to grips with humans			0
@entity114 , from the @entity115 for @entity116 at @entity117 in the @entity118 , said : ‘ captive birds think their mother was human , so new humans are potential partners , hence it flies at them			0
‘ he ’s not actually attacking , but he ’s a big bird with dirty great talons , so it ’s certainly a nerve - racking experience if he takes a sudden fancy to you			1
’ the centre is keen to rescue the bird , if the town approves			2
but support for @entity19 is so strong that even mrs @entity16 bears him no ill - feeling , although her husband @entity135 has bought a sonic scarer to deter him from further visits			1
‘ if he is looking for love , he ’s certainly taking bold risks , ’ she said			2
‘ a lot of people are concerned he might get hurt if someone takes the law into their own hands			0
’ for @entity29 and @entity147 , both 67 , @entity19 is a welcome visitor			0
mrs @entity147 can even call him down by mimicking his hoots – although her husband always steps in at the last second so the owl lands on him ( pictured above )			2
mr @entity29 said : ‘ he does a little tap dance then flies off again			0
i ’m not frightened of him , he ’s beautiful			0
’ others , however , have wondered what might happen if @entity19 swooped on a small child			2
his @entity75 page also contains warnings about his behaviour			0
‘ do not leave the house if the owl is out ! he just swooped at me as i walked down my drive , ’ posted @entity160			1
‘ claw marks on my head ! ’			0
