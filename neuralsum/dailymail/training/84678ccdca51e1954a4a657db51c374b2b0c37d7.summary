by @entity0 published : 20:05 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 20:49 est , 25 november 2013 @entity1 hailed a deal struck with @entity3 over its nuclear programme as good for the world after hours of ‘ painstaking ’ negotiations			1
the foreign secretary said the agreement , which would force @entity3 to downgrade its almost weapons - grade uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions , was a victory for diplomacy			1
but critics including @entity15 and @entity16 warned it was a ‘ disaster ’ for world peace , lifting £ 4.3 billion worth of sanctions on @entity3 with little evidence that @entity20 was serious about abandoning its nuclear programme			1
deal : @entity1 , who met @entity23 secretary of state @entity24 last night , hailed the deal over @entity3 's nuclear programme the deal was struck in @entity29 between @entity3 , the @entity23 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 after winning the critical endorsement of @entity3 ’s supreme leader , ayatollah @entity36			1
under the arrangement , @entity3 will benefit from the unfreezing of its foreign currency reserves and gain sanctions relief in trade in gold , precious metals , petrochemicals , auto and aircraft parts			2
there are hopes that the break - through will thaw decades of poor relations between @entity3 and @entity23 which started with the @entity51 in 1979			2
it is however just the first step in a six month programme aimed at getting @entity3 to stop enriching its uranium			2
there also seemed to be confusion between the world powers and @entity3 as to whether the deal would stop all uranium enrichment by @entity20			1
mr @entity1 said it would force @entity3 to scrap its stockpile of uranium that was enriched to 20 per cent			1
announcement : politicians including @entity1 ( far left ) announce the deal at the @entity67 today he described the negotiations as ‘ painstaking ’ on @entity69 but later insisted it was a ‘ good deal ’ for the @entity71 and the world			1
it will also force @entity3 to stop enriching uranium beyond the 5 per cent level – slightly above what is required to run a nuclear power plant			0
@entity3 is also meant to stop development of new enrichment centrifuges but will not be forced to dismantle existing ones during the six - month negotiation period			0
it will however have to stop work on its heavy - water reactor near the city of @entity85 which could lead to the development of weapons - grade plutonium			0
blessing : the deal won the critical endorsement of @entity3 ¿ s supreme leader ayatollah @entity36 mr @entity1 met @entity23 secretary of state @entity24 last night alongside the @entity93 prime minister to discuss the deal and the wider @entity71			1
he said the agreement should ‘ give us faith in the power of diplomacy and pressure to resolve even some very intractable problems			1
‘ this is a change in behaviour from @entity3 and we should respond constructively and openly to that and that ’s what we ’re doing , the tone of these meetings is very different from the past , i think they are very sincere , they are very tough negotiators			0
’ mr @entity1 said it was inevitable that countries such as @entity15 and @entity16 would harbour doubts over the credibility of the deal			1
the foreign secretary admitted @entity3 has a ‘ history of not revealing the truth of its nuclear programme ’ but he added it was the first time @entity3 had entered into an international agreement about its nuclear programme			0
after meeting mr @entity1 , senator @entity24 said the hard work could only begin now			1
this would involve taking the ‘ enormous steps in terms of verification , transparency and accountability			0
’ @entity3 ’s foreign minister and chief negotiator , @entity129 , said it was only the ‘ first step ’			0
‘ we need to start moving in the direction of restoring confidence , a direction which we have managed to move against in the past , ’ he said			0
@entity23 president @entity137 warned the tap of sanctions relief could be turned off if @entity3 did not keep up its end of the agreement			0
‘ there are substantial limitations which will help prevent @entity3 from building a nuclear weapon , ” he said in a late - night appearance at the @entity144 after the deal was sealed			1
‘ simply put , they cut off @entity3 ’s most likely paths to a bomb			0
’ warning : @entity23 president @entity137 , left , warned the tap of sanctions relief could be turned off if @entity3 did not keep up its end of the agreement			0
meanwhile @entity15 prime minister @entity155 , right , condemned the deal but @entity15 prime minister @entity155 condemned the deal			2
‘ what was achieved last night in @entity29 is not a historic agreement , it was a historic mistake , ’ he said			0
‘ today the world has become a much more dangerous place because the most dangerous regime in the world took a significant step towards obtaining the world ’s most dangerous weapon			2
’ and a @entity16 official said his government was ‘ very concerned about these negotiations with @entity3 ’ , adding : ‘ there is a lot of worry right now about threats to the region			1
’ @entity176 , @entity177 ’s shadow foreign secretary , said the deal was potentially the most important announcement between @entity3 and the @entity180 for decades			2
‘ crucially , the apparent agreement of the @entity3 government to curb enrichment and grant greater access to inspectors show the important progress that appears to have been made			0
‘ the strength of the agreement will be tested through its implementation , and if @entity3 is shown to renege on its obligations then the international community should be ready to reverse sanctions relief and maintain pressure			0
he added : ‘ in the days ahead it will be important for the @entity32 government to provide further details to @entity198 so that the interim deal can be closely scrutinised			2

@entity1 said that the *landmark* deal was a victory for diplomacy
but critics including @entity16 declared it a disaster for world peace
