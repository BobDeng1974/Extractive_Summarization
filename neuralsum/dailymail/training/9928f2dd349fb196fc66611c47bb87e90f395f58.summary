i was instead left with damage to my home and work that had to be reaccomplished for thousands more than originally estimated			2
member comments : my home was damaged ' the " work " had to be re-accomplished ; and @entity0 tried to sue me for " monies due for his " work			1

" i said that @entity195 " did n't want to talk to him , " closed the door , and called the police			0
( the police said his reason was that he had a " lien on my house " ; however this " lien " was made null and void the day i won the case according to the court			0
