the scene in the @entity1 could not be further removed from the horrors of war			2
there is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served , a clink of cutlery on crockery , the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups			0
somewhere outside , the clouds part and light floods the lounge			0
i reach for another scone , ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream , and marvel that , in this context , 70 years seems an eternity			0
rewind those seven decades and @entity27 's only five - star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital @entity31 – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere			1
seventy years on : @entity31 in @entity27 is one of the key locations for the @entity36 during the @entity38 ( 30 june 1940 to 9 may 1945 ) , this stately retreat was commandeered as the @entity39			1
invading officers would have stalked its corridors			0
by april 1945 , they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on @entity46 , and the @entity47 – bypassed by the @entity49 fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation			1
that eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto			2
the ongoing @entity53 ( 3 april – 11 may ) is a five - week hurrah of history , parades , concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – @entity27 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
this is no small feat. fiercely individual , the islands have never before combined to stage a big event			2
but here they have common cause			0
@entity68 itself will turn @entity31 and @entity60 's capital @entity70 into swirls of people and music			1
it is not difficult to find traces of @entity27 's harrowing half - decade			1
the occupation lingers in the old @entity78 fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy , sinister tower of @entity81 which rears up on the west coast ; the similarly menacing @entity83 in the north			1
intrigued , i stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of @entity89 , on the south - west shore			2
it is an oddly unnerving experience , the pillar - box slots in the bastion 's sides eyeing me quietly			2
when i face the water , i almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine - gun barrel on my neck			2
coastal curves : @entity27 's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of @entity102 you can go further into @entity27 's wartime heritage			1
what appears to be a car park behind @entity107 on the western outskirts of @entity31 reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the @entity47			1
hidden down a damp flight of stairs , the former @entity78 @entity112 is all but invisible unless you know it is there			1
this , of course , was the point			0
its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter , semaphore murmur and serious conversation			0
@entity78 signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls			1
the bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light			2
the @entity136 at @entity137 offers further perspective , flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of @entity142 , a local girl who dated ( and married ) a @entity78 officer ; on the other , exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island 's @entity147 population , and copies of the @entity150 turned to propaganda sheet			1
the darkness of life under @entity155 rule is most obvious at the @entity156 , at @entity157			2
this enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave - labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process			1
as did many of the injured @entity78 troops brought here from @entity167 after the d - day landings			1
with its dank passages and horror - film ambience , the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building			0
an island guardian : @entity175 has protected the east coast of @entity60 since the 13th century the picture is replicated 27 miles to the south - east			1
@entity60 is a short hop from @entity27 – around an hour by fast ferry , less by air			1
here , the @entity181 – another military - medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening , with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels			0
the side - effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies			0
but so can the joy that liberation brought			0
glorious video footage shows euphoria in @entity70 as the news of @entity78 surrender broke ; the @entity204 being hoisted at the @entity205			1
the hotel came to symbolise the @entity47 ' moment of deliverance			1
in a way , it still does , peering across what is now called @entity212 , where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing , as if they are flying a kite			0
other echoes resound across @entity70			0
the @entity220 and @entity221 has a catalogue of copies of the @entity224 dating back 125 years , its photos recalling the war era in day - by - day detail ( albeit through a fog of strict @entity78 control )			1
the nearby @entity230 proffers the @entity231 – a montage of bright images , stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995 , which depict @entity60 brought to heel – armed troops in the streets , the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire			1
and the @entity242 is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the @entity245 which were forced on islanders by the @entity155 authorities			0
there are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces			0
bright days ahead : a view of the pretty coastal enclave of @entity256 from the ramparts of @entity175 the heaviness of the @entity78 bootprint is perhaps summed up by @entity260 – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite			2
this colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – ' protected ' @entity70 from the far side of @entity265 's @entity102			0
the stairs into its depths seem to go down forever , to gun posts , control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as i walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy			0
and yet , just seven miles north - west , it all feels like a bad dream			0
@entity279 's @entity278 gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner			0
in the summer of 1940 , it was another @entity78 outpost , requisitioned as a hang - out by @entity286 pilots			1
it is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted			0
over breakfast , i peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach , and at @entity279 's , a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand			0
there is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks , the @entity47 are remembering a time when there was			2
