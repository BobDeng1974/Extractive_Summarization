raising questions : @entity5 on board the spirit of @entity20 during the @entity21 on the @entity23 members of the royal family @entity5 spent the pageant in close proximity to the @entity27 , prince @entity28 and the @entity29 and in an astonishing error of judgment the @entity31 charity director , who now lives in @entity32 in the @entity33 , was allowed to mingle with @entity36 on the @entity4 during sunday ’s @entity37			1

’ mr @entity5 defended his place on the body , saying : ‘ i have never tried to hide my convictions , even though the evidence presented was contentious			0
