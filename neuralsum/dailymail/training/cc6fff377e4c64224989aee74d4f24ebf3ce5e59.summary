a baby born without an immune system is trialling a world - first gene therapy cure to ‘ re-boot ’ her body ’s defence systems and give her the chance of life outside a sterilised environment			1
seventeen - month - old @entity10 suffers from @entity11 ( @entity12 ) - an inherited condition known as ‘ bubble baby ’ syndrome - which affects just one in 300,000 babies			2
she has all the appearance of a healthy child but her body is unable to fight even the mildest germs - meaning even a cough or sneeze could kill her			1
@entity10 , 17 - months - old , was born with @entity11 which means her body is unable to fight germs the radical new treatment - devised by doctors at @entity26 - has its risks but @entity10 ’s parents @entity29 and @entity31 , from @entity32 , have been left with few choices			1
‘ with @entity10 ’s condition , you ’re against a ticking clock , ’ said mr @entity31 , 43 , a real estate project manager			2
‘ if you do n’t do anything within the year , the chances of recovery and survival are very limited			0
‘ it ’s very rare that a child survives beyond two if nothing is done			0
’ @entity10 was diagnosed in march 2012 after her mother became concerned that she was sleeping too much and not feeding properly			2
at five - weeks - old she was admitted to hospital where doctors discovered that she had multiple infections including advanced pneumonia			0
@entity10 ( pictured with parents , @entity52 and @entity29 ) is having a world - first gene therapy treatment to 're - boot ' her body 's defence systems and give her the chance of life outside a sterilised environment the treatment works by re-engineering @entity10 's bone marrow to add a vital missing gene			1
doctors hope that this will allow her body to create its own immune system she was placed in isolation to stop her coming into contact with any more disease and the infections were tackled with a cocktail of antibiotics and anti-viral drugs			1
the family had to scrub down and wear masks and gowns before being allowed through an airlock - type room to see their critically ill daughter			0
things then went from bad to worse as doctors told them @entity10 needed an urgent bone marrow transplant for any chance of survival			1
both her sisters and parents did not match and so @entity31 and mrs @entity10 campaigned for the public to register as donors with the @entity92 and equivalent charities abroad			2
@entity10 ( pictured moments after her birth ) was believed to be a healthy baby until her mother noticed that she was sleeping a lot and not feeding well			2
she was admitted to hospital at five - weeks - old tests revealed that she was suffering from numerous infections			0
she was diagnosed with @entity11 and put on the bone marrow donor list but no match could be found but with @entity10 getting worse by the day the family decided to move her to @entity26			1
over the following months she slowly started to recover and finally put on weight and doctors managed to create an ‘ artificial ’ immune system for her			2
she has to take 15 medications a day and immunoglobulin transfusions every three weeks to maintain it - but it is still very weak			0
at this point , professor @entity111 , a consultant in paediatric immunology , approached the family about the possibility of gene therapy - and things are now starting to look brighter			2
a team led by the professor is in the process of trialling a new form of gene therapy on the youngster			2
@entity10 was getting sicker by the day waiting for a transplant so her parents moved her to @entity26 for pioneering treatment doctors used an extensive drug regime to create an ' artificial immune system ' for her but she is still very weak @entity10 is missing a gene which produces an enzyme vital to the production of a healthy immune system			1
the doctors have harvested her bone marrow and have re-engineered it using a new type of ‘ reprogrammed virus ’ to splice the vital gene she is missing into her dna profile			1
the re-engineered bone marrow has been re-inserted into her body and they hope a fully functioning immune system will develop			1
doctors estimate a 60 to 90 per cent chance of success			0
professor @entity111 told @entity147 that he hopes this form of gene therapy will be able to help many other children as well , and that it could eventually replace bone marrow transplants as the main form of treatment for children with immunodeficiency			1
as part of the treatment , @entity10 underwent a session of chemotherapy to wipe her existing bone marrow so that the new one can grow in its place			1
they are trying a new treatment which involves harvesting some of her bone marrow and re-engineering it to include a vital gene that she was missing			1
they hope this will allow her body to create its own immune system she has suffered sickness and lost some of her light - blonde hair in the process			1
she also had to be housed in a sterilised room during treatment to minimise the risk of catching a potentially fatal disease			0
@entity12 is a genetic disorder which results in a poor antibody response to germs			0
it is the most severe form of primary immunodeficiency and can be caused by any one of nine different gene mutations			0
it is also known as the bubble boy disease because one patient , @entity185 , became famous for spending 12 years living in a sterile bubble			0
patients are usually affected by severe infections early in their life - these can include pneumonia , meningitis and ear infections			0
if left untreated , the babies usually die within one year			0
the most common treatment is a bone marrow transplant			1
there were several scares after she contracted a virus and the bone marrow became contaminated with bacteria when it was inserted into her body			1
however , mr @entity31 said that in ‘ true @entity10 style ’ she fought them off and her cell count started to move slowly in the right direction			0
as this is a pioneering treatment , the long - term outlook for @entity10 is unclear and it could be months , years or even decades for side effects to surface			2
@entity10 returned home last month but the family will not know if her body has started producing its own immune system until @entity213			1
if the gene therapy treatment is found to be unsuccessful , @entity10 will require a bone marrow transplant			1
although a potential match has been found - this is not the preferred option as @entity10 would require more aggressive chemotherapy and face the risk that her body will reject the donor marrow			1
mr @entity31 , who has another daughter , @entity222 , 11 , from a previous marriage , said : ‘ when i look back at the last year of what we ’ve been through and what ’s happened to our family , it ’s very hard to describe			0
‘ i can only really summarise it as like playing a record and someone just grabs the needle and pulls it straight off with a horrendous scratch and then there ’s just silence			0
’ @entity10 ( pictured with her sister , @entity236 , three ) also had chemotherapy to wipe her existing bone marrow and allow the new marrow to grow			1
doctors believe there is a 60 to 90 per cent chance the treatment will be a success however , they have been buoyed by @entity10 ’s ‘ fighting spirit ’ which has seen her battle through several close scrapes			0
he added : ‘ @entity10 has maintained this internal resilience , which has baffled some of the doctors , where by , she has fought through all of these things whilst having no real immune system			1
‘ there is no medical answer why , she just has a very strong constitution which has enabled her to survive			0
‘ she ’s now , in a very strange way , a very confident baby , in that she ’s so used to being examined by doctors and people looking at her , people prodding , poking her , injecting her , that she ’s almost a child that welcomes any form of human interaction in the hospital , especially as when at home she ’s quite isolated			0
’ since @entity10 left hospital , the family have had to turn their house into a quarantine zone and must screen everyone , and everything , that enters the house			2
@entity10 has now been allowed home but her parents will not know whether the treatment has worked until @entity213			2
they have to disinfect everything ( pictured ) to ensure she is not exposed to germs mrs @entity10 , 39 , said : ‘ we sterilise probably three to four times a day and then anything that drops on the floor has to be washed and sterilised again			1
‘ there ’s also obsessive hand - washing			0
this is a house of compulsive hand - washers , but it has worked , it has really prevented any infections			0
’ the barriers they have had to impose on @entity10 has been particularly hard on the couple ’s other daughter @entity236 , three			0
she has to have limited contact with other children because of the risk of picking up a cold			0
mr @entity31 said he often sees her staring longingly out of the window at the other kids playing outside			0

@entity10 was born with @entity11
her body is unable to fight even mild germs meaning a cold could kill her
her parents are forced to disinfect their house 2 or 3 times a day
@entity314 was offered a bone marrow transplant but no donor could be found
@entity26 is now treating her with pioneering therapy
involves re-engineering her bone marrow to add a vital missing gene
they hope this will allow her to develop her own immune system
