by @entity0 lawmakers in @entity2 found a novel way to reduce rape and sexually transmitted diseases when they accidentally decriminalized prostitution			1
instances of rape dropped almost by one - third , and gonorrhea infection rates among women have dropped nearly 40 per cent after legislators revealed in 2003 they had effectively legalized the exchange of sex for money			1
the findings are detailed in a @entity17 paper , and show a sharp drop in instances of those events until state once again made prostitution illegal in 2009 – and then realized a significant jump in rapes			1
marked change : the number of rapes reported in @entity2 declines after the red line , which denotes the moment officials publicly acknowledged prostitution was no longer illegal researchers @entity33 , of @entity34 , and @entity35 , of @entity36 , believe their findings prove conclusively that legalizing prostitution lowers instances of rape and of @entity41 , they told the @entity42			1
the discovery was made during a 2003 court case in which a judge ruled that laws then on the books were not sufficient enough to prosecute a suspected prostitute , according to the @entity42			1
lawmakers had accidentally made the change by deleting too many words from statutes back in the 1980s and only made the discovery nearly 20 years later			1
the public announcement set off a wave of women being trafficked into the state to be used as sex slaves , opponents argued to the paper			0
but it also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of rapes being reported			0
statistics show instances of rape hitting an all - time high before dropping 31 per cent during the six - years prostitution was effectively legal			1
correlation : legalizing prostitution appears to have reduced rapes in @entity2 , according to at least two researchers @entity73 and @entity74 insist that 824 rapes were prevented by men having easier access to prostitutes			2
this finding held true across three separate methods of looking at the data			0
‘ i think we have convinced ourselves that we have done everything we can do rule out alternative explanations , ’ said @entity73			0
but this also raises a troubling question not addressed by the two men about whether prostitution is rape			2
‘ women in prostitution generally describe it as paid rape			2
that ’s what if feels like to them , ’ psychologist @entity96 told the @entity42			0
@entity99 , an expert with @entity100 , also argued that legalizing the sex work led to more women being brought in to @entity2 against their will			0
‘ demand fuels trafficking , ’ said @entity99			0
‘ with the demand for commercial sex , there 's an incentive for traffickers to traffic women and girls to these locations			0
with increased demand , you ’d expect to see increased supply			0
’ @entity73 and @entity74 discovered the majority of the women deciding to enter the world ’s oldest profession were @entity120 and @entity121			2
they also insisted to the @entity42 that prices dropped and the incentive for organized crime to enter the racket diminished – until the state once again made prostitution illegal			2
reported rapes saw a modest jump , but to only a fraction of where they were prior to 2003 , the study showed .			1

the laws were accidentally taken off the books in the early 1980s and not discovered changed until nearly 20 years later
rape rates dropped 31 per cent and @entity41 infections rates nearly 40 per cent from 2003 to 2009 , a study found
instances of rape rose *slightly* in 2009 after prostitutes were once again forced back into the shadows
