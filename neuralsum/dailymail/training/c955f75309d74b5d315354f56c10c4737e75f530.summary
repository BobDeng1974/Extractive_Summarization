barred : the university installed special gold bars to prevent students from jumping off the upper floor 's of the school 's library after a string of suicides in the 2003 - 2004 academic year the top 50 college has received a reputation for its high suicide rate after a string of four deaths in the 2003 - 2004 academic year			1
this prompted the school to install special gold bars on the atrium of @entity115 where many of the suicides occurred			1
students have argued that while the bars stop suicides from happening in the library , the university is n't doing a good enough job at addressing the root of the issue			1
