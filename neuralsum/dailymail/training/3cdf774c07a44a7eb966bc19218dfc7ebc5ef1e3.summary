with weeks to go until the @entity1 kicks off , the preparations are well and truly underway			1
it 's time for new stars , new optimism , and of course a new ball			2
unveiled by adidas in late 2013 , the ‘ @entity15 ’ is the official ball of the @entity1 and it ’s the 12th the sports giant has made for the global tournament - and @entity11 took the opportunity to road - test it back in december			1
following on from the heavily criticised @entity16 in @entity17 , the science inside the new ball has now been revealed to show how the best players in the world will have the perfect tool on the pitch			1
the never - before - seen panel shape revolutionizes the game by producing faster flight speed and maintaining true roundness			0
the bladder of the @entity15 ball is made of latex and provides the desired rebound			1
the ball is textured and feels more like the adidas ’ finale 13 , the official @entity55 ball , than the adidas @entity16 used in @entity17 four years ago			1
the @entity61 ball , in a bold white / night blue / multicolor colorway befitting @entity59 , is the most colorful ever for a @entity62			0
@entity25 came under fire four years ago for the unpredictability of their ball , with goalkeepers especially unimpressed			1
@entity68 compared it to a ' beach ball ' , @entity67 said it made players ' look like drunken sailors ' and @entity59 stopper @entity75 claimed it was ' like a ball from a supermarket '			0
but adidas claim the ' rougher ' @entity15 will avoid an ' unreliable flight ' , and will have vastly improved touch and accuracy			1
‘ we do extensive flight path analysis and the results have shown constant and predictable paths with deviations hardly recognisable , ’ @entity83 , @entity25 football director , told the @entity84			1
the ball itself weighs 437 grams ( 0.96 pounds ) and it has a water absorption rate of just 0.2 per cent , meaning it can retain its shape , size and weight even in the rain ( which could benefit @entity98 in @entity99 )			0
the manufacturers have recently announced that a promotional ball will be fitted with six cameras to capture a 360 degree view of the on - pitch action			1
according to their @entity107 page : ' adidas developed an innovative camera - ball ; the brazucam			0
capturing 360º views through six different lenses , offering fans around the world the opportunity to enjoy and share the love of football from an entirely new perspective			0
skills test : @entity119 ( left ) and @entity120 ( centre ) juggle with the @entity123 ball in training on wednesday keep up : @entity125 ( second right ) also got a taste of the official @entity1 ball at @entity128 likes what he sees ? @entity59 boss @entity130 ( centre ) casts his eye over his squad weighs 437grams circumference 69cm rebound 141cm loss of pressure 7 % water absorption 0.2 % altitude 0 - 1600m tested over 2.5 years 600 players involved 287 players interviewed ( 30 % non-adidas players ) six - panel shape @entity142 carcass butyl bladder @entity145 based foam material @entity146 thermal bonding all - over regular texture the ball is created by six propeller - shaped polyurethane panels being thermally bonded together			1
between the seams the @entity15 also has a different geometry to other balls , helping it remain more stable in the air			1
‘ the most important thing on the soccer ball is how much roughness you have , ’ dr @entity156 , an aerodynamics expert at @entity159 ’s @entity158 in @entity160 , told the @entity84			0
smoother balls , as seen with the previous @entity16 , are more unpredictable due to a process known as ‘ knuckling ’			1
as air passes over the seams it can create a force that knocks or moves the ball			1
the @entity15 , with its multiple seams and roughness , will be less prone to the ‘ volatile swoops ’ of the @entity16			1
‘ the smoother you make the ball , the higher the speed at which it knuckles , ’ says dr @entity156			0
‘ in essence what happened in my opinion is that with the traditional ball , the critical speed at which you got maximum knuckling was lower than the typical kicking speed in @entity1 soccer			2
‘ by making the ball smoother , that critical speed went up and happened to coincide with the typical kicking speeds , about 50 to 55 miles ( 80 to 88 kilometres ) per hour , especially in free kick situations			0
’ this year ’s rougher ball brings us ‘ back to square one ’ says dr @entity156			0
another way the @entity15 seems to have overtaken the @entity16 from four years ago is the depth of the seams			1
the @entity15 ’s are about 0.06 inches ( 1.56 millimetres ) , compared to just 0.02 inches ( 0.48 millimetres ) for the @entity16 , about three times shallower			1
the total length of the seams on the @entity15 are also longer , and all of this combines to make the ball rougher - travelling further			1
it can be compared to dimples on a golf ball , with the seams disrupting the flow of air			2
‘ this agitation is essential for fast and reliable flight , ’ dr @entity212 , a research fellow at the @entity213 at @entity214			0
robo - boot : the @entity15 underwent a series of extensive tests , including this robotic boot trial , in order to meet and exceed @entity62 regulations putting the pieces together : the @entity15 ball is comprised of a groundbreaking six - panel design , which improves symmetry , uniformity and efficiency ‘ a perfectly smooth ball experiences large amounts of drag and high aerodynamic forces			1
‘ the seams of a football disturb the flow of the air			2
‘ this results in a smaller wake - area of low pressure - behind the ball - reducing the pressure difference and reducing the force , which slows the ball down			0
the lower drag force means the ball travels for a longer distance			2
’ the result is that the ball should more closely resemble traditional 32 - panelled balls that most footballers are used to , with @entity156 insisting ' the complaitns we got in the last two @entity251 will be minimised			0
despite this ball having just six panels , the deep and long seams will create one of the most advanced footballs yet used at a @entity1			1
and @entity75 , hoping to lift a dream trophy with his @entity259 colleagues this summer , is a lot happier			0
' the ball is a good one , we had contact with it today , ' the former @entity263 and @entity264 player said of the @entity15 after training with it on wednesday			2
' i think the outfield players are going to like it too , ' he added			0
glove affair : goalkeeper @entity75 eyes the new @entity15 ball during training in @entity278 still like it , @entity75 ? the keeper gestures after a ball is struck past him and into the net back of the net : goalkeeper @entity284 stretches for the ball but ca n't prevent a goal during training bring on the @entity61 : @entity98 captain @entity288 believes the new @entity1 ball will be the best yet world in his hands : @entity292 will be hoping to lead @entity293 to glory at next summer 's showpiece in @entity59 @entity297 - based players have had a six - month advantage with the colourful samba - inspired ball , as @entity98 and other nations could not kick it competitively due to a @entity303 contract			1
they have been using a similar @entity305 ball			0
@entity59 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 must also use the ball in their international friendlies leading towards the @entity1			2
@entity292 used the @entity15 in an international friendly for @entity293 , and @entity98 captain @entity288 has joined him in praising the newest model			2
' the sign of a good ball is when no one really talks about it , ’ the @entity319 midfielder said at the launch event in december			0
‘ i do n’t think anyone will have anything negative to say about @entity15			0
i think the feedback from players will be really positive			0
' it 's very true and reliable , and those are the two most important things i want from a ball			0
' the @entity55 ball has always been a big favourite among the players because of how reliable it is			2
@entity15 ’s very similar and i think the players will be very happy about that			2

@entity25 has unveiled how the @entity15 has been improved for the players
the @entity1 football is a big improvement from 2010 's effort
it has longer and deeper seams to make it less volatile in the air
this means it will travel further and more accurately during games
2010 's @entity16 was criticised for being too unpredictable by players
promotional ball has six cameras ( @entity359 ) fitted to capture on - field action
@entity363 national team already praising the new ball
