by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 may have smashed their transfer record to sign striker @entity4 but manager @entity5 insists the fee is irrelevant if the player fulfils his potential			1
the @entity9 international landed on @entity11 for a flying visit from his homeland on wednesday to finalise a five - year contract after a £ 28million deal - believed to be a £ 25million fee with subsequent add - ons - was agreed with @entity18			1
@entity2 's previous record was the £ 15million paid to @entity20 in 2006 for midfielder @entity21 , who moved on to @entity22 last summer for £ 28million			1
permanent home : @entity4 has joined @entity2 from @entity18 for £ 28m , having spent last season on loan at @entity26 you must deliver : manager @entity5 has called upon @entity4 to justify his transfer fee , a club record , and fulfil his potential @entity5 stressed , however , the player will not carry that burden into the dressing room			1
' @entity34 is vitally important but his transfer fee will not count for anything in terms of him developing and having an important role in the side , ' said the @entity40			2
' this dressing room has got a special feeling and it is not about how much you pay for players to come in , it is about selecting the players to be in there			0
' we really needed @entity49 at the club and that is where the chairman ( @entity53 ) and the board have been exceptional and i do think it is a key moment at our club			0
' i am looking at that number nine position - and i am probably biased - but he is potentially the best choice in world football			0
' in years to come you will see him develop into someone special but nothing changes for @entity65 ' he needs to enjoy his football , have the same standards he had and i am excited to see how far @entity34 can take us and how far we can take @entity69 familiar surroundings : @entity4 spent last season on loan at @entity2 , scoring 16 goals in 33 appearances hot shot : @entity4 celebrates scoring against @entity76 at @entity77 last season ' that is the partnership we can see here			1
' it is true this moment in @entity49 's career is very significant because he is very ambitious , he wants to be successful and win things and wants to develop to the top of his potential			2
' that is what we want to be as a team , so it is a perfect fit			0
' @entity4 said he is comfortable with the transfer fee and intends to provide the goals , having scored 16 in 33 appearances on loan at @entity26 last season , to help fire the club into the @entity96			1
asked how long it could be until the @entity2 were playing alongside @entity99 's elite the @entity9 said : ' if we continue to develop like we did last season very soon			1
' i wanted to stay in the @entity101 because it is the most attractive league in the world and also the best			0
' for me it was easy to stay here and help the team reach that level			0
not wanted : @entity108 took the decision to sell @entity4 , believing that @entity18 had sufficient attacking options for the season ahead ' i think the club wants to make a statement and i want to help the club to make a statement in this league			1
' i do n't put myself under pressure and just want to help my team - mates make this team as good as possible			0
' @entity5 is still keen to add more signings , having already secured another loan player @entity122 on a permanent deal and also brought in £ 4million midfielder @entity124			2
however , he may now have to rely on loan signings - the @entity2 have been linked with a temporary deal for @entity18 's @entity127 - having used most of his transfer budget to secure @entity4			1
incoming : @entity122 ( centre ) , who was on loan at @entity2 from @entity131 , has also made his contract permanent ' i said before we signed @entity34 we need three attacking players and that has not changed , ' said the @entity2 boss			2
' i always said money should n't be the difference between being able to challenge or not			0
' it excites me when i see the side we have			0
maybe some have the excuse of having to have a certain amount of money to challenge for titles but i do n't look at it that way			0
