governments ' refusal to send troops and the @entity5 's bungling response to @entity6 has cost lives , aid charities say			1
a catalogue of errors has led to the outbreak teetering on the brink of becoming the ' definitive humanitarian disaster of our generation ' , @entity8 said as it made a rare appeal for troops to be sent to @entity18			1
the charity accused world powers that did not send soldiers of ' costing lives ' , warning that there was a two - month window to curb the spread of the virus			1
a ' brain drain ' , which has seen medical staff leave the worst - affected nations to countries such as @entity45 , has left parts of western @entity18 ill - equipped to deal with the crisis			1
according to @entity50 , @entity49 executive director @entity48 said : ' we are angry that the global response to this outbreak has been so slow and inadequate			1
' we have been amazed that for months the burden of the response could be carried by one single , private medical organisation , while pleading for more help and watching the situation get worse and worse			0
@entity18 's ' brain drain ' : most of the brightest medical students moved to wealthier nations , leaving the virus - hit nations ill - equipped			1
slow to act : @entity5 and @entity65 countries have been accused of reacting slowly to the crisis , with aid still only trickling through			1
incompetent workers : dr @entity69 , who discovered @entity6 , says @entity5 's regional office in @entity18 did not act when the virus began to spread			1
lack of information : an internal report from @entity5 suggests people in the worst - affected nations were not made aware of how to deal @entity6			1
bureaucracy : the same leaked document says ' politically motivated appointments ' held up the @entity81 agency 's response			0
not enough money : world powers , including @entity84 , have been accused of not donating enough aid to countries tackling @entity6			1
' when the outbreak is under control , we must reflect on how health systems can have failed quite so badly			0
but the priority for now must remain the urgent fight against @entity6 – we simply can not afford to fail			0
' @entity6 has claimed the lives of 4,500 people so far , with 8,914 infected , although the true number is far higher			2
the worst - hit nations are @entity33 , @entity97 and @entity98			0
according to a leaked internal report from @entity5 , who are organising the international response to the crisis , serious mistakes were made while dealing with the virus ' spread			1
the report says the @entity81 agency acted too slowly in its response to the initial @entity6 outbreak and that ' politically motivated appointments ' created too much bureaucracy			2
' nearly everyone involved in the response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall			0
a perfect storm was brewing , ' it says			0
while many of the richest countries have donated aid to the crisis - hit region , people have called on some nations to up their efforts			2
the @entity45 has donated £ 75million to the cause , more than all except the @entity127 , and @entity128 has called on other @entity130 countries to double their contribution			1
the prime minister has also sent 750 troops to western @entity18			1
more than 4,500 people have died from @entity6 in western @entity18 , and this number will continue to grow until world leaders send more troops to the region , @entity8 said shadow international development secretary @entity139 said @entity6 was an ' existential threat to some of the countries that are affected by it ' in @entity18			1
speaking on @entity143 , he said : ' this has taken the entire world , including the @entity45 , far too long to get to a position of dealing with this as effectively as it should			0
' the early warnings of this were in march and april of this year and it 's now taken the world until this moment to see the scale of the disaster			0
' he said the @entity45 was ' doing well ' in the scale of its response but other countries had to do their bit			0
' the fact is the founder of @entity163 @entity162 has given many more times the donations than countries like @entity84			2
@entity167 , the furniture warehouse , has given more or about the same as @entity84			2
' so there are countries that are n't doing enough and we have to say that publicly and we have to try and persuade them			0
but if countries like @entity84 wo n't do their bit we have also got to embarrass them			2
' dr @entity69 , who discovered the ebola virus , said who had acted far too slowly			0
he said : ' it 's the regional office in @entity18 that 's the front line			2
and they did n't do anything			0
that office is really not competent			0
