a massive offshore wind farm scheme designed to power a million homes has been axed , raising the risk that @entity3 could be hit by blackouts			1
@entity6 company @entity5 pulled the plug on the £ 4billion , 240 - turbine @entity9 project in the @entity11 , citing ‘ technical challenges ’ and spiralling costs			1
but critics yesterday blamed disagreements within the @entity16 for creating uncertainty and discouraging investment in renewable energy			1
@entity20 has said he wants to ‘ roll back ’ green taxes in next week ’s autumn statement , with senior @entity24 sources last week alleging he ordered ministers to ditch the ‘ green c * * p ’			0
scrapped : @entity6 developer @entity5 is pulling the plug on the 240 - turbine @entity9 project , pictured , the @entity28 said but leading @entity32 remain committed to green levies , which currently add £ 112 to the average bill , and pay for clean energy such as wind farms and solar panels			1
an industry insider said : ‘ the mixed messages coming from government over whether it supports renewables has undermined investor confidence			0
‘ without a consistent approach , this will not be the last large - scale project that gets pulled			2
’ there are 22 offshore wind farms in operation , supplying power for 2.5million homes			2
another 24 are either being built or in the pipeline , with offshore wind expected to generate enough electricity for 15million homes in the next decade			2
@entity56 , energy analyst at @entity57 , said scrapping the @entity9 could risk energy security			1
‘ the reason the government liked offshore wind was that you can build them in really big chunks and they produce a lot of power , unlike onshore wind , ’ he added			0
‘ when big coal plants come offline , you have to have something that can replace them			0
' new nuclear wo n’t be ready until the end of the next decade			0
now it looks like wind wo n’t be ready until then as well , so what will replace our coal ? ’ @entity79 , director of offshore wind at @entity5 , said : ‘ given the technological challenges and market conditions , now is not the right time for @entity5 to continue to progress with this project			0
’ claims : critics blame @entity16 for discouraging investment in renewable energy for the company 's decision to pull the plug on the project the @entity9 had drawn criticism from environmentalists , concerned about its impact on marine wildlife , and campaigners who branded the planned 720ft - high turbines as unsightly			1
but @entity101 spokesman @entity100 said : ‘ @entity103 green - bashing by some at the heart of the @entity16 is starting to cost jobs and threaten the future security of our energy supply			1
’ @entity110 has also been accused of fuelling uncertainty after pledging to freeze energy prices for almost two years if @entity113 wins the next election			0
last month , @entity115 warned the risk of blackouts this winter was at its highest for six years			0
the number of coal - based power plants in the @entity3 has fallen sharply due to @entity122 legislation , which has caused older , polluting , fossil - fuel plants to be turned off			2
plans for some gas - fired plants have been suspended because of economic pressures			0
a @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ the decision was made on purely technical grounds and reflects the many complex challenges of constructing offshore wind farms			2
the @entity3 still expects to deploy significant amounts of offshore wind by 2020 and we remain well placed to meet our 2020 renewable energy target			1
