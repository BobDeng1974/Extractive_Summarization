warning : metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity0 has warned there could already be as many as 200 return jihadis in @entity3 there could already be as many as 200 returned jihadis in @entity3 alone , @entity5 ’s most senior policeman has warned			1
speaking yesterday , metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity0 also added his voice to those calling for terrorists who go abroad to fight to be stripped of their @entity5 passports			1
and he called for the return of the controversial control orders which were used to tightly restrict the movement and behaviour of terror suspects			1
the orders were replaced in 2011 by less restrictive measures , but with more than 500 @entity5 said to be fighting for @entity19 and other militant groups in @entity21 and @entity22 – and 250 said to have returned to the @entity5 – sir @entity0 said the ‘ drum beat has changed ’			1
speaking on @entity25 , he said : ‘ certainly for us anything that either stops them from going or preferably stops them from coming back is a good idea			0
‘ if it works , we should do that			0
it seems to me it ’s a privilege to have a passport and be a citizen of this country , and if you ’re going to start fighting in another country on behalf of another state , or against another state , it seems to me that you ’ve made a choice about where you what to be			0
’ and he warned the real number of ‘ militarised ’ jihadi fighters back in the country could exceed the official estimate of 250			0
@entity5 militants have adopted an increasingly high profile in @entity21 , posting sickening pictures of corpses and beheadings on social media			1
the murderer of @entity58 journalist @entity57 , 40 , who was beheaded as part of an @entity61 video , is thought by voice experts to be from @entity3 or the south - east			2
sir @entity0 said the force is working with @entity58 counterparts to firmly establish whether the murderer is @entity5			2
calling for a return of ‘ something like ’ the abolished control orders – which enabled the authorities to tell terror suspects where to live and place them under lengthy curfews – he added : ‘ they were stopped because the threat was reduced and quite properly they were seen as too intrusive			2
sickening video : the murderer of @entity58 journalist @entity57 , 40 , who was beheaded as part of an is video ( pictured ) , is thought by voice experts to be from @entity3 or the south - east ‘ but i think these things have got to be considered when the drum beat changes , and it ’s clear that the drum beat has changed			0
’ earlier this week @entity85 said those who ‘ continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state ’ should lose their @entity5 citizenship , and the law should be changed so there is a ‘ rebuttable presumption ’ that those visiting war areas without notifying the authorities had done so for a terrorist purpose			0
sir @entity0 – who also said that there had been ‘ too much sensitivity ’ over tackling hate preachers on the streets of @entity5 – added : ‘ the big thing for us , that we have talked about , is if we can get an assumption that when people come back and they have been to @entity21 , they have been involved in terrorism – if they can prove they have n’t then it ’s up to them			1
’ speaking out : earlier this week @entity85 ( pictured ) said those who ‘ continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state ’ should lose their @entity5 citizenship			0
