watching a recent episode of the female detective drama @entity3 , i suddenly felt deeply uncomfortable			1
the heroines of the @entity5 show — two gutsy , senior , women police officers — were discussing how to solve a crime , while their bumbling male counterparts sat around , gawping helplessly			1
whenever the men managed to get a word in edgeways , it was to suggest a course of action that was utterly stupid and they were put in their place by their female superiors			1
there is something dishonourable about the portrayal of men as completely useless for the purposes of entertainment says @entity24 no doubt this demonstration of ‘ girl power ’ is intended to make the show appeal to me as a woman , but instead , it made me feel rather queasy			1
there was something dishonourable about the portrayal of men as completely useless for the purposes of entertainment			1
yet the more i flicked through the channels , the more i realised that , increasingly , almost everything on tv — from comedies to reality shows , murder mysteries and even adverts — now features women as the heroines , equipped with a fine brain , while men are depicted as thoughtless buffoons , aggressors , or ineffective idiots			1
take a recent @entity49 advert			0
a dad and his two offspring are sitting at a table in one of the chain ’s restaurants , waiting for @entity56 to bring their order over			0
both children remain engrossed in their phones , as @entity60 unsuccessfully attempts to get their attention by suggesting activities for the afternoon			0
watching a recent episode of the female detective drama @entity3 , @entity24 suddenly felt deeply uncomfortable when @entity56 returns and makes the same suggestions , naturally both kids answer immediately , leaving @entity60 looking like a twit			1
it gets a cheap laugh and might be easy to shrug off , were it not for the fact that any advertiser who tried to achieve sales by belittling women would n’t be tolerated			2
it ’s the same story in tv comedy			0
in the really big hit shows , there seems to be a pretty set formula , whereby the male characters are idiotic , if endearing , fools , saved from themselves by the women			1
in friends , for example , the male characters , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , are , respectively , two well - meaning but ineffectual geeks and an unthinking lothario , while the female characters , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , are far more well - rounded and worldly			1
from @entity95 to @entity96 , the most influential @entity98 shows feature flaky men who wo n’t be serious , or take responsibility for anything			2
the formula persists in popular @entity104 tv			0
in @entity105 , buffoonish @entity105 , played by writer @entity106 , veers between sentimental fool and drunken idiot and is , apparently , incapable of growing up			0
he ’s constantly wrong - footed by his on - off love interest , the formidable @entity111 ( co-writer @entity110 )			2
in family comedy outnumbered , @entity112 is the blundering dad who is constantly befuddled by his children			0
his wife , @entity115 , is exhausted and long - suffering , but far sharper , shrewder and more capable			2
in the wildly popular children ’s cartoon show @entity117 , the family ’s father , @entity118 , is a hapless bumbler , while it ’s clear @entity124 is the boss of the household			0
what all of these shows have in common is that they exaggerate the uselessness of men			2
but it ’s the insidiousness of this socially - acceptable sexism that ’s most concerning			1
for it ’s not overt hatred of men , rather the casual denigration of them , so often done for comic effect			2
in friends the male characters are well - meaning but ineffectual geeks and an unthinking lothario , while the female characters are far more well - rounded it seems belittling men barely registers any more , yet making fun of women — especially joking about violence towards women — is something we ’d never stand for			1
consequently , comedienne @entity151 is able to make jokes about men that would never be deemed acceptable the other way around			1
for example : ‘ what ’s the way to a man ’s heart ? straight through the chest with a kitchen knife			0
’ and do n’t laugh , but there is also an alarming trend for men to be portrayed as sex objects			2
gone are the days when a half - naked woman could come on stage in a skimpy , lamé two - piece , smiling inanely , as a magician ’s assistant			1
but the amount of male flesh on display in shows like @entity175 is staggering			1
yes , the women wear skimpy costumes , too , but when the camera lingers over the naked torsos of dancers like @entity183 , the whoops from the audience are reminiscent of the @entity185 amphitheatre			2
when @entity187 danced the @entity189 topless in series eight , head judge @entity186 congratulated him on ‘ working your assets ’ , while @entity193 declared : ‘ your body looks amazing , which helps			1
’ they would never get away with it if they leered over a woman ’s physique so blatantly			2
is it all harmless fun ? i do n’t think so			0
in spreading @entity203 : the @entity204 , @entity205 and co-author @entity206 warn that this patronising of men is now so pervasive in movies , tv , comic strips and even greetings cards , that it could have ‘ disastrous consequences ’ for society , and eventually provoke a serious backlash against women			1
since the mid- 1990s , they argue , men have been increasingly portrayed as evil or inadequate			2
they have gone so far as to say there is now a culture of ‘ misandry ’ — literally ‘ hatred of men ’			2
when @entity187 danced the @entity189 topless in series eight , head judge @entity186 congratulated him on ‘ working your assets ’ which would never be acceptable to say of a woman ‘ our hypothesis is that , like misogyny once upon a time , misandry has become so deeply embedded in our culture that few people , including men , even recognise it , ’ they write			1
feminists have rightly fought for an end to men putting women down , but we will surely never improve relations between the sexes by ushering in a new era of sexism that consists of women constantly traducing men			1
once you are aware of it , you start noticing how this culture of misandry seems to permeate everything			0
as i had lunch with a friend recently , she snatched up her ringing phone and began barking a tirade of abuse into it			0
‘ what do you mean , you ca n’t find their football kit ? i do n’t have time for this ! show some initiative			0
i ca n’t nursemaid you			0
do n’t call me again			0
’ i assumed she was having bother on the nanny front , but no — it was her husband , a man who works tirelessly , in a highly - pressurised career , to support her and their children			2
he was off work that day and had offered to stay at home with the kids so she could go to lunch with me			0
comedienne @entity151 is able to make jokes about men that would never be deemed acceptable the other way around i wish i could say her diatribe was an isolated incident			1
i notice more and more that my girlfriends speak to their husbands and boyfriends in a derogatory manner , as if they are somehow inferior			0
needless to say , they then complain that they are not ‘ manly ’ enough in their attitude , or in the bedroom			0
i have to confess that i ’m not altogether innocent			0
my boyfriend , @entity291 , and i were in @entity292 the other day , when i snapped at him to hurry up because he could n’t decide what to order			0
he walked out , which was hugely embarrassing for me			0
but i would n’t have put up with him talking to me in this obnoxious way , so why should he ? i count myself fortunate to have a boyfriend who is an unreconstructed , traditional — even macho — male			2
what ’s particularly worrying is that a lot of my friends do not hesitate in putting their husbands down in front of the children			2
surely , in doing so , they teach their daughters to denigrate and disrespect men and make their sons feel emasculated and demoralised			0
is it any wonder girls are now outperforming boys at @entity310 and a-level ? girls are already ahead in most subjects by the age of five and the gap widens as they get older , the latest research shows			0
last year , there were 40,000 more female applicants for university places than male , while women outnumber men by three to two in many universities			1
there are also more young women entering the top professions such as medicine			0
research also suggests a quarter of @entity104 women are now the family breadwinner — five times more than at the start of the @entity334			0
female earnings have soared 44 per cent since then , compared with 6 per cent for men			1
psychologist @entity337 , author of boys and young men : attention must be paid , says relegating men to supporting roles , such as stay - at - home dad or house - husband , is damaging			1
‘ were n’t under - education , under - employment and relegation to the home among the major motivators for the modern women ’s movement ? are we parents of sons simply supposed to sit back and say to our boys , “ college is n’t essential , but if you do go , maybe you ’ll meet a future doctor or lawyer ; in fact , maybe you could be her secretary			1
and , listen , there ’s nothing wrong with being a house - husband ! ” last year , there were 40,000 more female applicants for university places than male , while women outnumber men by three to two in many universities ‘ did women working far below their true abilities turn out to be a good thing ? obviously not			1
then why should we expect it to be a good thing for men ? ’ ultimately , if the background noise of our lives is banter about male inadequacy , while leering at their biceps , it is in no one ’s interests — least of all women ’s			1
one of the unintended consequences of belittling men is that we women end up with the sort of men we really do n’t like , if truth be told			1
for , when we are not lampooning men for being idiots , we seem to be attacking them for not being manly enough			0
we only have ourselves to blame			0
if we want our men to be in any way exciting , gallant , high - earning , swashbuckling , or , indeed , protective , we have to allow them to keep their dignity and self - respect			1
running a man down never turned him into @entity400 .			0

there is something dishonourable about portraying men as useless
in friends the male characters are well - meaning but ineffectual geeks
the female characters are far more worldly and well - rounded
@entity187 was *praised* on @entity175 for working his assets
such comments would be *unacceptable* if made about a woman
@entity151 jokes about men that would *n't* be acceptable about women
last year , there were 40,000 more female applicants for university places
women outnumber men by three to two in many universities
