by @entity1 reporter published : 16:00 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 17:40 est , 16 october 2013 a two - year - old boy died from meningitis after his parent 's desperate 999 call got ' lost in the system ' and referred to @entity7 meaning a paramedic was not sent out until it was too late to save him			1
@entity10 was rushed to the @entity11 a full hour - and - a - half after his parents called the emergency services - but by then medics said it was too late to save his life			1
an inquest heard how @entity10 's family , originally from the @entity18 , had dialled 999 at 10.26pm on may 29 last year after a large rash formed quickly on the youngster 's belly at their home in @entity25 , @entity26			1
delay : @entity10 , 2 , was rushed to the @entity11 ( pictured ) a full hour - and - a - half after his parents called the emergency services - but by then medics said it was too late to save his life @entity30 , acting service delivery manager for @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , said that because none of the family members spoke @entity35 , it was ' difficult ' for the call handler to determine how serious the incident was			1
she admitted the call handler failed to source an interpreter , which meant he did not grasp how serious the situation was			1
as a result , he wrongly chose to involve @entity7 , when it was the @entity45 - which deal with more urgent 999 calls - which needed to be sent details			2
he also failed to complete the referral form to @entity7			2
the inquest at @entity50 heard a second 999 call , which was properly handled , was made at 10.50pm and led to a paramedic arriving at the scene at 11.29pm			1
assistant deputy coroner @entity54 , ruled that had the first 999 call been handled correctly , a paramedic would have arrived approximately 13 minutes earlier			1
dr @entity57 , who led frantic efforts to save the youngster told the inquest the boy had developed meningococcal septicaemia - a life - threatening infection brought on by meningitis			1
he said it was a condition that can bring about death very quickly and that ' every minute counts '			0
asked if @entity10 would have lived had he arrived at hospital sooner , dr @entity57 replied : ' probably , yes '			1
mr @entity54 , said it was ' not possible to say ' whether @entity10 would have survived had the earlier call not been ' lost in the system ' and the response been 13 minutes quicker			2
it also emerged that a paramedic chose to go against national guidelines when it came to treating @entity10 at the house			2
@entity78 - the first paramedic to arrive - said the boy was so ill it was clear he needed a dose of the antibiotic benzylpenicillin			0
guidelines stated the drug should not be administered if the medic is unsure about whether the patient has any allergies			0
mr @entity78 said this was impossible to determine as nobody in the house spoke @entity35			0
based on the fact the child ’s condition was rapidly deteriorating , he instructed a colleague to administer the benzylpenicillin			0
mr @entity96 said the paramedic was ' between the devil and the deep , blue sea ' and that he should be praised for ' bravely ' making the call that he did			0
the inquest was also told about a ' missed opportunity ' earlier in the day to uncover the serious nature of @entity10 ’s illness			0
@entity10 ’s grandfather , also called @entity10 , phoned @entity107 , on the day the toddler fell ill. mr @entity10 explained , via a telephone interpreting service , that @entity10 had a fever , pain in his stomach and was struggling to breathe			1
the receptionist , @entity113 , advised him to fetch some medicine from a pharmacy to ' bring his temperature down '			0
giving evidence , she admitted she should have ' concentrated more on the abdominal pain '			0
however , mr @entity96 did not criticise her actions , pointing out that there had been no clear signs to suggest the @entity10 was seriously ill and that she advised mr @entity10 to call back if his condition deteriorated			2
in delivering his verdict , mr @entity96 said @entity10 had fallen victim to a condition that was every parent ’s and medic ’s ' worst nightmare '			0
afterwards , a spokesperson for @entity31 said it was ' sorry for the error in the categorisation of the call ' , and that action had been taken to prevent the incident happening again .			0
