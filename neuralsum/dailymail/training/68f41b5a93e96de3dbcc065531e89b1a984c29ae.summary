' hey , is your dad the bass player in @entity2 ? ' there it was … the standard question during my weekly social event			1
as usual , i 'd try not to act irritated , slap on a smile and respond with a civil return : ' yes he is ! @entity12 ' @entity11			1
' a tedious drone of questions about fame , tours and life - as - ­ the ‐ daughter ‐ of ‐ a ‐ d ‐ list ‐ rock ‐ star would follow , most of which i would politely answer before excusing myself to get another wine … or two			2
i suppose it would be socially inappropriate to tell the truth : that you ca n't judge a band by its cover			0
my responses ( if not silence ) are melancholy answers , much like how i respond to sloppy pick - up attempts or family friends who ask the age - old questions such as ' what are you studying ? ' or ' what are your life goals ? ' my father is a stranger to me , and does not deserve any personal rhetoric , especially through superficial email			1
@entity27 ( left ) , with her sister , @entity55 , has told how her father is a ' stranger ' to her @entity2 at a hotel room in @entity58 circa 1988 - from left @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
@entity65 was raised by her mother @entity66 ( left ) and says she has ' a very fortunate life ' however , there was an occasion recently when i did manage to find a heated reaction			1
a mere few hours after the much ‐ awaited @entity2 miniseries : ' @entity72 , ' aired in @entity73 , i had a lovely egotistical email in my inbox asking : ` ' what did you think of @entity78 playing myself ? ' much like the @entity2 autobiography , the series failed on all accounts to factually explain @entity12 's personal life – not to mention his @entity84 syndrome			1
@entity65 and her sister @entity55 grew up on a @entity87 farm with their father when he was n't touring @entity65 writes that her father @entity12 has ' five children in three different countries ' @entity65 writes that her dad is ' now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside ' the lovable @entity78 , playing my father , @entity97 ' , rationalises sleeping with a backup singer because he was ' lonely ' and ' she was beautiful '			1
there you go folks , it 's all justified when you see a beautiful woman and you 're lonely on tour , while your pregnant wife was at home with a brand new @entity108 as a gift for your return			1
the series seemed to conveniently leave out the fact that @entity12 has five children in three different countries and is now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside			1
or that the fetus in the opening scene of ' @entity72 ' - soon to be me , has mostly grown up without a father			2
@entity119 rock band @entity2 first formed in @entity120 as @entity2 in 1977			2
the band - made up of @entity122 on keyboards , @entity61 on drums , @entity62 on guitar , @entity60 on guitar and saxophone , @entity63 on bass , and main lyricist @entity59 on vocals - was fronted by @entity59 for 20 years			0
the star , who dated pop singer @entity130 in the 1990s , was found dead in his hotel suite in @entity120 in november 1997			0
@entity2 , who have sold close to 40 million records worldwide , had their story turned into a tv mini series in 2013			1
@entity2 : never @entity136 aired on the @entity137 in february this year and told of the band 's behind the scenes antics			1
@entity141 played @entity59 , @entity142 played @entity60 , @entity143 played @entity62 , @entity78 played @entity27 , @entity144 was @entity61 and @entity145 was @entity122			2
meanwhile , @entity146 played band manager @entity147 and @entity148 was cast as @entity130			0
sure , i had a comfortable childhood			0
until the age of thirteen , i was riding in tractor buckets , hunting bandicoots and sitting in the tin dingy on one of our dams - all memories i shared with my dad and our secluded farm in @entity161 , @entity87 , north of @entity120			0
but as my proverbial father once quoted in their autobiography ' @entity165 to @entity166 ' : ' the cliché is true : you do n't know what you 've got until it 's gone			2
' for $ 45 apiece , you would think he would stick to a more honest motto			0
when @entity2 's long ‐ lived fame fell to the wayside , as it expectedly did , my dad did not accept it easily			1
for a man who thrived off a diet of sex , drugs and rock'n'roll , a settled family lifestyle with us was not appealing in the slightest – he longed to be back on tour fooling around with instruments and women			0
about the time we sold the farm , everything went south , including my mother , sister and me			0
my father told us he was packing up and moving to the @entity193 to marry one of his conquests on the day we were moving house			1
there were the obvious reassurances ( as in any divorce scenario ) that the family would remain as close to normal as possible and our father / daughter relationship would not falter			0
how could it ? he was only moving 12,000 kilometres away			0
we are a decade on , and i am lucky to receive an email on my birthday – never filled with anything more than petty small talk , attached photos of his two - ­ year ‐ old blonde twins and the frequent sign - off of , ' i am your @entity212 ' – which is obviously always read in the voice of @entity215			0
@entity65 ( right ) and her sister , @entity55 , says her father ' longed to be back on tour fooling around with instruments and women ' she explains how her little sister found out about her father 's affairs in the @entity2 autobiography in the school library @entity65 ( pictured here on her 21st birthday with a friend ) says she is ' fine ' because her mother raised her a multitude of excuses have escaped my dad 's mouth in his time , but never the word ' sorry '			1
it is clear he is not sorry that my little sister found out about his first affair in the @entity2 autobiography in the school library , or that we were sent to four psychologists to understand why we were upset with him for abandoning us like stray dogs			2
for the record , i am fine			0
thanks to my mother i have a very fortunate life and am working hard to follow my dreams			0
if i have learnt one thing from my parents though , it 's how far apart two people can be			0

@entity27 , 22 , has *revealed* how the only contact she has with her father is via email
@entity265 , *57* , now lives in the @entity193 with a new wife and children
@entity65 says the recent @entity137 tv series about @entity2 failed to ' factually explain @entity12 's personal life '
she says it did not mention her father 's ' @entity84 syndrome '
