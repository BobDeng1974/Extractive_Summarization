by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 19:48 est , 5 december 2013 @entity1 of @entity2 , the most senior woman in the judiciary , said @entity4 must rule on prisoner votes @entity7 judges have the right to overrule @entity9 when it comes to votes for prisoners , one of this country ’s leading judges has declared			1
@entity1 , the deputy president of the @entity16 and the most senior woman among the judiciary , said @entity4 human rights judges must step in to protect prisoners because @entity20 will not do the job			1
and in a ringing defence of the @entity23 , she condemned critics who want to deport foreign criminals or illegal immigrants who claim to have family ties in @entity28			1
some people , she said , think we should ‘ deprive @entity28 children of their right to live and grow up and be educated here if this will be the effect of deporting their only or primary carer			2
’ @entity1 added : ‘ some critics are simply hostile to anything @entity7			1
’ the defence of the @entity4 court and human rights law opened up a rift between @entity1 and other senior judges who have launched fierce attacks on the @entity44 over the past few days			1
this week recently - retired lord chief justice lord judge said that ‘ @entity4 is not superior to our @entity16 ’ and warned of a ‘ democratic deficit ’ which has grown because @entity7 human rights judges meddle in matters that should be for @entity9			1
in an even more strongly - worded intervention earlier this month another @entity16 judge , @entity50 , compared the behaviour of the @entity4 court on prisoner voting to the activities of communist @entity56			0
‘ to give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old @entity56 was democratic , ’ he said			0
@entity1 ’s speech - given as a lecture at the end of november but published only yesterday - set her at odds with her colleagues and confirmed that there is now serious division among the leaders of the judiciary over human rights law			1
the prisoner voting row has been running since 2005 , when @entity4 judges ordered @entity28 to give the vote to convicted prisoners , who have historically been considered to have removed themselves from the electorate			1
despite overwhelming votes in favour of maintaining the law in the @entity83 , the @entity7 judges have continued to repeat their instructions			2
@entity1 said : ‘ i have no personal view on which prisoners should be given the right to vote			2
but i do think that the issue is a good example of why we need human rights legislation			2
‘ @entity9 is rightly proud that it represents and is accountable to the people			0
@entity1 said @entity20 can not be trusted to protect the interests of prisoners ‘ but members elected under the present franchise do not represent , and are not accountable to , the people who are currently disenfranchised			1
‘ the purpose of any human rights protection is to protect the rights of those whom the majority are unwilling to protect : democracy values everyone equally even if the majority do not			2
’ @entity1 added that the media were hostile to the @entity23 , passed by @entity105 in 1998 to make @entity4 rules part of @entity28 law , because ‘ it was seen as a threat to press freedom from the outset			1
’ she added that ‘ there was a perception that it has prevented us from sending some dangerous foreigners back to their home countries and generally allowed people with no right to be in this country to stay here once they have established a private or family life here			0
‘ not every member of the public is persuaded that we should not export people if there is a real risk that they will be tortured in the country to which we send them , ’ @entity1 said			0
she said ‘ it may be no coincidence ’ that home secretary @entity135 and justice secretary @entity136 ‘ have been most vocal in their opposition ’ to the @entity23			0
scrapping the @entity23 , @entity1 said , would ‘ raise all sorts of interesting questions about the effect of the decisions which have been made during the period while the @entity23 was in force			0
’ she said that that new rights had been established and ‘ there is indeed a point to the @entity23			0
’ @entity1 , 68 and twice married , has been an appeal judge since 1999 and , in 2009 , the first woman on the @entity16			2
she has built a reputation as the most radical and feminist of the senior judiciary			0
as head of the @entity150 that recommends reforms to the government , she shaped the @entity153 , the 1980 law blamed by some for stripping parents of power over their children , and the @entity159 , a no - fault divorce reform law pushed through by @entity161 that was later dropped when it proved unworkable			0
in a @entity16 judgement in 2011 , she changed the definition of domestic violence so that it now includes shouting at a partner or denying them money as well as actual physical assault .			0

@entity1 has called for @entity4 *'s* human rights judges to protect prisoners , claiming *mps* can not be trusted to do the job
most senior woman in judiciary condemned critics who want to deport foreign criminals or illegal immigrants who claim to have family in @entity28
she said : ' some critics are simply hostile to anything @entity7 '
