they say the devil is in the detail			0
but one horrified @entity4 mom was left reeling after she saw , what she describes , as a detailed ' satanic symbol ' in the break lights of a school bus while driving through @entity9 , @entity10			1
@entity11 from @entity12 said she was stuck behind the bus in traffic when she was cursed with the sight of the star - shaped red break lights in a circle which looked like a @entity19 pentagram			1
@entity20 ? this is the school bus which had the ' evil ' satanic pentagram symbol in its brake lights close up : the lights were caught on camera by a worried woman after she saw them while stuck in traffic symbol : the ' @entity29 ' is a symbol used by witches and satanists for their own style of worship worried that she was being shown an evil sign as she drove through town , @entity11 snapped a picture of it and shared it with her local news station			1
she told @entity39 : ' anyone who fears a @entity41 , if not @entity41 and @entity42 , should be outraged			0
if you ca n't put a cross on there , you can not put a pentagram on it			0
' the ' @entity29 ' is a symbol used by witches , wiccans and @entity19			1
some satanists and occultists have adopted it as their holy symbol , but other faiths use it as well			2
since her discovery , @entity11 has been joined by other local parents who believe that something sinister could be happening in the area - culminating in the takeover of taillights on school buses			1
they have all taken to social media to protest against the ' evil ' brake lights on a government vehicle			2
they 're now calling for the lights to be removed from the buses and replaced with a single red bulb so that they can rest easily at nights knowing that they 're no longer in use			2
@entity11 from @entity12 , was driving in traffic when she caught sight of the star - shaped red break light wiccan : @entity78 , pictured , said people needed to ' find out what it really means before getting riled up ' but one practicing @entity77 said that there is nothing to fear and everyone needs to calm down			1
@entity78 , a practicing wiccan told @entity39 : ' find out what it really means before you start getting riled up and all worked up about something			0
' others argue that it was not a @entity91 sign and was simply a red brake light			0
@entity93 and the @entity94 declined to comment .			0

@entity11 from @entity12 was driving in traffic when she saw the lights
she immediately thought they looked like an evil @entity19 pentagram
satanists use the pentagram as a symbol of worship along with others
@entity11 and other local parents think it could signal something sinister
they want the lights to be removed so that their faith can be restored
