by @entity0 published : 02:41 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 07:27 est , 10 march 2014 ex-member : former diamond mountain member @entity2 told @entity5 's @entity4 about the bizarre practices of the retreats leader @entity7 a new investigation into a mysterious @entity10 yoga retreat - likened to cult - and the death of one of its members alleges the @entity16 - educated leader condoned bizarre tantric sex rituals at his camp			1
it was the death of @entity21 - graduate @entity20 from exposure and dehydration in the desert after he had been expelled from his love rivals @entity7 's @entity26 in june 2012 , that shone at light on the shady religious practices of the @entity30 community			1
aired on sunday , @entity5 's @entity4 re-examined the circumstances surrounding @entity20 's passing and spoke with a former member , almost two years after he was found in a cave alongside his wife , @entity35 who had separated from @entity7 three years previously			1
@entity20 and @entity35 were hardcore devotees of @entity37 , studying literally at the feet of @entity7 at his @entity10 desert compound			1
by all accounts , @entity7 demanded total obedience from his followers , that some have compared to a the megalomania of a cult			1
at the @entity48 retreat , nearly 40 aherents pledge to meditate for three years , three months and three days			2
their only communication is by paper and pen			0
mysterious end : @entity20 , died after fleeing a @entity30 retreat with his wife @entity35 , right			1
they camped in the @entity57 mountains where @entity20 died of exposure and dehydration divisive : @entity7 's teachings and rituals were questioned during the course of his relationship with @entity35			1
he and @entity35 lived in a yurt together , right , for years before she left him for @entity20 , their attendant it is run by divisive @entity16 - educated monk and @entity35 's former husband , @entity7 , whose teachings have been rejected as unconventional by some , including the @entity72			1
@entity7 , who had previously run a diamond business worth tens of millions of dollars , raised eyebrows for promoting @entity30 principles as a path to financial success , the @entity73 reported in the aftermath of @entity20 's death in 2012			1
one of his former students , yoga teacher @entity81 described the leader as a ' charismatic @entity30 teacher ' who he respected until his popularity ' turned him into a celebrity '			1
others have cited concerning initiation ceremonies			0
another former volunteer , @entity2 , told @entity5 's @entity4 that his involved ' kissing and genital touching '			2
he also made the bizarre claim that @entity7 , who as a @entity30 monk should not have had sex let alone marry , made unusual exceptions for bedding @entity35			1
' he said that he had never had sex with a human woman , ' said @entity2 to @entity4 , explaining that @entity7 told his followers that @entity35 was a supernatural being and not a woman			2
according to @entity2 the sexual rituals at @entity26 became increasingly bizarre			1
' it was so surreal , but then there was a part of me that was thinking that these were some kind of sacred rituals and perhaps something amazing is going to happen , ' said @entity2			2
another former follower , @entity30 monk , @entity110 described walking in on @entity20 ’s creepy devotional practice to @entity7			1
yoga retreat : this is @entity26 sanctuary in @entity10 where attendees agree to live in silence for three years ' @entity7 had a room in this temple in @entity118 and sometimes i would crash there , ' said @entity110			1
' so i walked in once and saw @entity20 , lying prostrate on the floor in the middle of some sort of devotion to @entity7			1
' he was very much intent on staying with @entity7 - it was very clear he had some form of attraction to the teachings of @entity7			1
witness : @entity30 monk @entity110 saw first hand the devotion of @entity20 to @entity7 ' the strong devotion that @entity7 asked of his followers came with a tantric element			1
' there are normal relationships a @entity30 with have with his followers and then there are vows of a tantric nature			2
' you have to do what they say			0
this can be very dangerous when taken out of context and is like a cult			0
' another of his questionable practices was his secret marriage to @entity35 , which is forbidden by @entity37			0
it lasted more than a decade and ended in 2010 - a month before she married @entity20			1
the couple met in @entity154 when he was her teacher			0
despite the 20 - year age gap , their friendship became something more - and they vowed never to stray more than 15ft from each other			2
@entity7 and @entity35 had lived together in a yurt throughout a three - year retreat he had promoted from 1999 , but they claimed they were celibate and kept the marriage secret from others			1
but , as the @entity169 reported , his version of celibacy was also questionable			0
criticism : @entity30 scholar @entity172 , left , and the @entity72 , centre , both turned their backs on @entity7 after it came to light that he had married ' we are not allowed to have sex , but in yoga there are practices that involve joining with a partner , ' he said			1
' they are secret , and you are not allowed to disclose them			0
you might think of them as sex , but their purpose is to move inner energy			0
it takes very strict training			0
' together , the couple wrote books and presented lectures around the world			0
when the marriage came to light , @entity7 said he and his wife came from @entity200 backgrounds so they wanted to carry out a @entity200 partnership , as well as a @entity30 one			1
he added that he wanted her to be able to legally claim his possessions if he passed away			0
but the union garnered derision from @entity30 scholar @entity172 , father of actress @entity208 , who said he should renounce his monastic vows - but @entity7 refused			1
the @entity72 's office called it ' unconventional behavior ' and refused to see him when he traveled to @entity213 with his students in 2006			2
but in 2009 , @entity35 left @entity7 for @entity20 , a young student who had once served as their attendant			1
after , @entity7 was seen dancing in @entity218 clubs with @entity220 models			2
he said of the break up : ' you should see your partner as an angel who came to teach you			0
i look at @entity35 that way - the education is finished and now she is teaching a new person			2
if you try to see it that way , it helps your heart to hurt less			0
' her union with @entity20 seemed far from simple			2
in a lecture before they fled , she admitted he had become violent and she had stabbed him			0
tragic : @entity20 , right , was found by a search - and - rescue team in a cave after @entity35 , left , raised the alarm she used a knife the couple had been given as a wedding present , but later claimed she was practicing martial arts and it went wrong			1
he suffered three stab wounds to the chest			0
in a letter written after they left the retreat , she wrote : ' of course it was an accident ! i would never do harm to anyone ’s body on purpose , least of all my holy husband , who i adore			0
' she explained : ' we were simply fooling around , like children playing with their father ’s samurai sword , unaware that eventually someone is bound to get hurt			0
' after the incident , they were given five days to leave , but they left immediately			0
in her letter , @entity35 said they were not ready to re-enter the world so were going camping on land next to the retreat ' to get our thoughts settled '			0
when members of the retreat searched for them , they hid in a cave			0
the people also left water for them , knowing they were around , but the couple fell ill and could not retrieve it , authorities said			0
on april 22 at 6 a.m. - six weeks after they left the retreat - @entity35 sent a distress signal to @entity26 from a transmitter she had been carrying			2
when caretakers could not find the couple , they called 911			0
a search - and - rescue team from the @entity291 found @entity20 had died from dehydration and exposure , and his wife was weak and delerious			1
three of @entity26 ’s caretakers set out to look for her and mr. @entity20 , but could not find them			2
around 8 a.m. , the caretakers called 911			0
the retreat will end on april 3 , 2014			0
of its original 39 participants , 34 remain .			0
