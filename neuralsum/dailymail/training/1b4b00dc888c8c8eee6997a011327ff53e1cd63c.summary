epidemic : rising levels of obesity is a major problem sweeping the @entity11 people with a @entity18 of 30 or more are considered to be obese and are at risk of serious health defects			1
' obesity has contributed to a stunning rise in chronic disease rates and health care costs			2
it is one of the biggest health crises the country has ever faced , ' said @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity38 executive director			0
' the good news is that we have a growing body of evidence and approaches that we know can help reduce obesity , improve nutrition and increase physical activity based on making healthier choices easier for @entity11			2

' later this summer @entity39 and @entity38 will release the annual report @entity153 as in @entity154 , analysing state obesity rates and policy efforts to address the epidemic , as well as recommendations			1
it will include details on where costs could be saved from citizens achieving a mere five per cent @entity18 reduction			1
for a six - foot - tall person weighing 200 pounds , a 5 per cent reduction in @entity18 would be the equivalent of losing roughly 10 pounds			0
the report will also , for the first time , forecast 2030 obesity rates in each state and the likely resulting rise in obesity - related disease rates and health care costs			1
