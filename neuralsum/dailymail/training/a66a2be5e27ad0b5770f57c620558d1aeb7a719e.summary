by @entity0 tragic : @entity1 , 17 , was mauled by a 39 - stone polar bear as he slept during a trek through @entity4 an @entity6 schoolboy was mauled to death by a polar bear while trekking through @entity4 after his team leaders used paper clips to secure the safety wire			1
@entity1 , 17 , was on a £ 2,500 adventure holiday to the remote @entity14 islands when a bear entered their camp , dragged him out of his tent , and killed him			1
four others were severely injured before they managed to shoot the bear			2
today , it emerged the trip - wire which should have alerted them when the bear approached had been secured by a paper clip			1
the alert system is designed to set off mines if an animal or intruder crosses the wire			1
but organisers of the @entity33 trek in august 2011 , which hosted 73 children , today admitted one of the wires was faulty and a team leader tried to fix it using the piece of stationery			1
the revelation comes at the start of an inquest into @entity1 's death			1
a report published to coincide with the first day found the trip wires were inadequate , there should have been a bear watch , and the team should have been trained to use rifles			1
sir @entity51 , author of the report , blasted the ' inadequate ' safety measures advised by @entity4 authorities , ruling that the incident ' was not unforeseeable '			1
he said teams should not be allowed to trek in the @entity56 without proper rifle training			1
and the team relied on an ' inconsistent ' trip - wire system to alert them to the presence of polar bears - but it was inadequate as the warning would be too late			1
however , @entity65 , from the @entity33 , defended the move , claiming it made the wire more effective			0
he said : ' the whole system is designed to give you an alert for you to wake up and do something about it			2
it 's not a defence , it 's not going to kill an intruder , it 's going to alert you			0
' mr @entity65 also admitted that the tripwires were not working perfectly and one of the leaders had adapted one using a paper clip to make the trigger - mechanism more sensitive			1
he continued : ' it was a paper clip and it did improve the system , and i had no reason to doubt that was the case			1
' mr @entity65 said that the alternative system of carrying out bear watches had been put in place at the base camp after a recent sighting of a polar bear in the region , but nothing had been seen for the week that they had been held			1
@entity1 's parents @entity51 and @entity99 leave the coroner following the first day of the inquest into their son 's death			1
his mother said they presumed a trip so expensive would be safe danger : a report by sir @entity51 found the trip - wires used to sound alarms when a polar bear approaches did not work			1
the animal tore apart @entity114 's tent , dragged him out and mauled him before chasing others @entity1 's parents @entity99 , a gp , and @entity51 , a surgeon , appeared in court to say they presumed a trip so expensive would be safe			1
dr @entity121 said she was ' more anxious ' than her husband and son and went through every detail in the risk assessment to reassure herself about the group 's protection			0
' the trip was an expensive trip , i believed that they would have proper equipment , ' she said			0
' i thought @entity1 would have a bear flare , i thought they would have things like bear spray			1
' i believed that the camp would be protected by trip wire			1
i was naive , i had no idea how a camp site should be set up at that stage			0
' i did n't know there was the possibility that a trip wire may or may not work			1
i did n't know they were so fraught with difficulty			0
' the team had set up camp on the @entity149 glacier and were sleeping in five tents when the 39 - stone bear struck			2
four others were injured by the rampaging animal before team leader @entity154 , 27 , managed to shoot the animal in the head with a rifle			1
students @entity159 , 16 , and @entity160 , 17 , who were sharing a tent with @entity114 , were seriously injured in the attack			2
shot : after a scramble to find bullets for a rifle , one of the leaders shot the underweight 24 - year - old bear describing the incident , sir @entity51 explained how the bear had approached through the north - western side of the trip - wire system but none of the warning mines had exploded			1
it then ripped open the tent on @entity1 's side and dragged him out , causing potentially fatal head wounds			2
the rest of the camp woke up to screaming and shouts of ' bear ! '			0
@entity1 appeared to try and sit up and stand but the bear reared up and slammed into him , pushing him to the ground			2
he was not seen to move again , the report says			0
there was then a shambolic scramble for guns , but no one in the team could work the rifles			0
' in the meantime , ' he writes , ' [ one of the leaders ] had got hold of the rifle			0
he operated the bolt to seek to load and cock the rifle but it failed to fire			0
he operated the bolt on three or four more occasions without causing the rifle to fire			0
on each occasion a bullet was ejected on to the ground leaving the rifle empty			0
' the bear then turned on [ the leader ] and mauled him about the head			2
[ the other leader ] had previously emerged from the rear of the leaders ' tent			0
' he was unable to pick up the gun as the bear was over it			0
' he realised that , having seen the attempts to shoot the bear fail , he needed the spare bullets but was not immediately conscious of where they were and shouted for help in finding them			0
' unable to load a pen flare , he started throwing stones at the bear - which turned on him and mauled him too			2
the bear continued to move between the bodies of @entity1 and the two leaders , while attacking other members of the group as they tried to flee			2
sir @entity51 described how some members of the camp had managed to escape to about 20 metres from the scene			0
he continued : ' [ the first leader ] now managed to find one of the bullets that had been ejected , went back into the front of the tent to retrieve the rifle , loaded the rifle and , as the bear came back close to him , shot it dead			2
' the trip was an expensive trip , i believed that they would have proper equipment - @entity1 's mother , dr @entity99 sir @entity51 said the group then rallied and started to tend to the injured and calls were made for help from the local emergency services , although problems were experienced with the communications equipment , and the rescue team arrived by helicopter in a ' remarkable 35 minutes '			1
a post mortem on @entity114 concluded that his death was caused by ' extensive soft tissue and bone injuries to the face and neck including destruction of the right facial artery '			0
an investigation found that it was ' a very old bear ' in the region of 24 years old with 25 being the usual maximum			0
it was seriously underweight , about 250kg rather than the typical 400kg and it had ' heavily worn and painful teeth '			0
sir @entity51 concluded by praising the group members for their bravery			0
he said : ' all members including not least @entity1 demonstrated great courage in the face of the attack which started while the camp was asleep			2
' likewise considerable presence of mind was shown by the uninjured members of the party in the aftermath of the attack in tending to the wounded and calling for help			0
' the inquest continues .			0
