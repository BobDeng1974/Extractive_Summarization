by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 , mail online deputy political editor pressure on @entity4 to quit as @entity6 leader intensified last night after the party ’s wipeout in the @entity10 elections			1
following a catastrophic night , which cost him all but one of his meps , he was forced to admit he had lost the argument over @entity10			0
in an emotional interview , in which his eyes appeared bloodshot , the deputy prime minister said being beaten into fifth place by the @entity21 had been ‘ gutting and heartbreaking ’			1
but mr @entity4 found an unlikely ally this morning - in @entity23			1
the former prime minister praised mr @entity4 's ' courage and leadership ' in taking on @entity27			1
but mr @entity23 added that the @entity6 were still on course to be wiped out in next year 's general election			1
@entity49 and activists broke cover to insist that mr @entity4 should resign , saying it would be ‘ insanity ’ to carry on without a change of leadership after such an ‘ abysmal ’ result			1
leaked polling published by the @entity58 suggested the @entity6 wipeout could be repeated at next year ’s general election , with mr @entity4 even set to lose his own seat			1
the concerns over mr @entity4 ’s future are now so serious that senior @entity64 are discussing what it would mean for the future of the @entity67 if mr @entity4 was forced to stand down			1
on a dramatic political day : in a catastrophic night , the @entity6 lost all their seats in every region apart from the @entity71 as @entity27 romped to victory with 24 meps and a 28 per cent share of the vote			1
@entity42 ended the night with 20 meps , the @entity64 19 and the @entity43 three			2
how the nation voted it led to calls yesterday for mr @entity4 to stand down , with business secretary @entity80 tipped as his possible replacement			1
after several hours of silence yesterday , mr @entity80 was forced to publicly deny there was an ‘ issue ’ over leadership			2
but at a rally in @entity31 , mr @entity46 said : ‘ i would be very surprised if he [ mr @entity4 ] led the @entity6 into the next general election			1
’ he thanked mr @entity88 for challenging him to two tv debates , which the @entity6 leader was widely judged to have lost badly			2
mr @entity46 said : ‘ @entity4 , to whom i am personally extremely grateful , because challenging us to those debates really kicked off the whole @entity10 election campaign			1
’ but the former prime minister @entity23 said mr @entity4 had done the right thing in standing up to mr @entity46			1
he said : ' to be fair to @entity4 , i do n’t want to damage him by saying this , but over the last few years he ’s shown quite a lot of leadership and courage as a leader			1
' but the problem the @entity6 have is nothing to do with @entity10			0
the problem they have is very simple			0
they fought the 2010 election on a platform significantly to the left of @entity42 and then ended up in a @entity41 government with a platform significantly to the right of @entity42			0
' if you 're someone who voted @entity6 in 2010 because you liked their total opposition to tuition fees , you 're going to be somewhat disappointed , let 's say , when the people you vote for end up in a government that triples them			2
that 's the problem the @entity6 have and there 's not much cure for that			2
' former @entity125 chancellor @entity124 said the @entity6 were in a ' big electoral dilemma ' because they were no longer the protest party			2
he said : ' i prefer the politics to the psephology			0
but actually , if you think about the @entity133 , firstly they 've lost the protest vote - which is a big part of their vote			0
if you want to protest , you vote @entity27 now because [ the @entity6 ] have joined the government			2
' they lost about 50 % of their former supporters who were otherwise on the left , @entity42 supporters who voted @entity6 to try to keep the @entity41 out			0
' so the @entity133 are on a big electoral dilemma ; pro-europeans probably voted @entity6 at this election but most pro-europeans did n't vote			0
' celebration : a jubilant mr @entity46 sank pints at the @entity147 - and credited mr @entity4 with his victory @entity4 felt the true force of public disenchantment with his party in his own back yard			1
in @entity153 , where he stands as an mp , the @entity6 were pushed into fifth place			2
in nearby @entity157 , it was a similar situation for @entity158			0
he sits as one of the town ’s mps , but @entity42 only came second there , behind @entity27			0
the @entity64 face a tough by - election in @entity164 next week and will be hoping to improve on their standing in the @entity10 vote			0
@entity27 beat them by 10,027 votes to 9,641			0
but @entity170 fought off the @entity27 challenge in @entity172 – which contains his @entity174 seat			2
the @entity64 held @entity27 off into second place			2
the opinion polls which were leaked were commissioned by a @entity6 activist and suggest that mr @entity4 will lose in @entity178 to labour by 33 points to 23 , finishing even behind the @entity64			1
in the 2010 election , mr @entity4 won over 50 per cent of the vote			1
the polling also suggested the @entity6 will lose @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185			2
but a @entity6 spokesman dismissed the poll 's findings			0
he said : ' we have no idea where this polling comes from but it has clearly been commissioned and leaked for political purposes			0
' it bears no relation to the result we saw on thursday night , where @entity6 secured 38.7 % of the vote across @entity178			0
@entity42 managed 23.6 % , whilst the @entity64 came fifth with just 10.7 %			0
' mr @entity4 , appearing at @entity38 in @entity31 , appealed for his party to hold its nerve until next year ’s general election , insisting ousting him as leader would be even more catastrophic for the party ’s prospects			1
looking exhausted , he said : ‘ if i thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership , changing strategy , changing approaches , bailing out now , changing direction , then i would n’t hesitate advocating it			0
’ isolated : mr @entity4 after voting in the @entity10 elections			1
leaked polls suggest he would lose his seat but 12 @entity6 mps were said to be ready to publicly call for mr @entity4 ’s head , though some of those on the list denied involvement in a plot			1
@entity6 mp @entity221 said he wanted mr cable to take over as leader , blaming his party ’s ‘ abysmal ’ showing on voters ’ attitude to mr @entity4			1
‘ if we carry on as usual we are like the generals at the @entity228 , because the losses are so horrendous			0
given the scale of the losses , to call for business as usual is frankly ludicrous , ’ he said			0
former @entity6 president @entity233 said mr @entity4 was ‘ politically toxic ’ and ‘ no longer credible ’ and should step down as party leader , while remaining deputy prime minister			1
business secretary mr @entity80 , who is currently in @entity237 , said the results were ‘ exceptionally disappointing ’			0
but he added : ‘ @entity4 did a bold thing in standing up to the eurosceptic wave which has engulfed much of continental @entity10			0
we are the only party to have taken that on and he personally deserves tremendous credit for that			0
‘ there is no leadership issue ... now is not the time for infighting and introspection			0
the party must hold its nerve			0
’ there is a small band of ‘ @entity64 ’ in the @entity252 , who believe a change of leader would restore @entity6 fortunes – which in turn could stop @entity42 picking up enough disaffected @entity6 votes to win power			1
senior @entity64 are understood to believe mr @entity4 is likely to survive the leadership crisis but have discussed for the first time what would happen if he is pushed out			1
they expect the @entity6 would move to a so - called ‘ confidence and supply ’ arrangement , under which a minority party in a coalition pledges @entity268 support to the government in any motion of confidence , or any @entity272 relating to finance and spending			2
it would not prevent the minority party opposing the government on other areas of policy .			0
