when they first played one another seven years ago @entity0 was left fuming at @entity3 ’s behaviour			1
on sunday afternoon they will fight it out for the @entity6 and the @entity7 …			1
and the tidy sum of $ 11.44 million			1
the pair are tied at the top after @entity0 shot 67 – his 25th score under par out of his last 27 rounds - and @entity3 a 69			1
for the former , there ’s the chance to add yet more lustre to a season that has already seen him claim two majors plus two other prestigious events			0
for the latter , he has the opportunity to win for the second week in a row			0
if either wins the event with its $ 1.44 million first prize , they will also take home the $ 10 million @entity30 bonus			2
@entity39 , @entity38 , @entity37 or the ever - consistent @entity36 might have might have something to say about that			1
@entity36 starts two off the pace , with the other trio a further shot adrift			1
but if either @entity0 or @entity3 remain in the top two one of them will win the @entity30 bonus , regardless of the efforts of the others , because of their higher ranking going into the event , following the first three @entity30 play - off tournaments			1
back in 2007 it was all about pride at the @entity61 , where @entity0 felt @entity3 went too far in playing the role of the ugly @entity63			1
‘ loud and obnoxious ’ was his verdict			0
@entity0 watches his tee shot on the tenth hole during the third round of the @entity6 happily the pair have now settled their differences			1
‘ we were very young at the @entity61 , ’ said 27 year old @entity3			2
‘ at 20 you ’re going to do things you ’re going to regret			0
’ they ’ve not done too much to regret in the interim , of course			0
the pair began this event as the two hottest players in the world – and have gone out and shown it			0
out in the last group as well on saturday , they fought a tense battle , with @entity3 ’s brilliant putting stroke keeping him in the race			2
he has now gone more than 150 holes since his last three putt – and has n’t missed one inside 6ft for two events			0
as for @entity0 , he shrugged aside a slow start to the back nine with a wonderful eagle three at the 15th , where he rolled in a 30ft putt			2
@entity0 versus @entity3 would be a brilliant dress rehearsal for the @entity95 at @entity96 but for the fact the latter is n’t part of the @entity63 team			1
neither is @entity42 , the other young @entity63 who currently leads the @entity30 race but who has left himself a mountain to climb today after slipping four off the pace			0
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity3 are tied for the lead going into the final round in @entity108 @entity0 shakes hands with @entity3 following their third round of the @entity6 @entity63 @entity95 captain @entity111 underlined his exasperation with a text to @entity3 on friday : ’ why did n’t you play like this earlier ? ’ but leaving @entity42 behind is all his own fault			1
he took on @entity0 over the final 36 holes in @entity117 a fortnight ago and beat him – just 24 hours before the wild cards were announced			2
the timing looked perfect – except @entity111 went for @entity120			0
as he has been doing all week , @entity121 continued to trawl the bottom of the field , coming in with a 72 to be placed 27th in the 29 man field			0
playing alongside him , fellow wild card pick @entity126 beat him by one to be tied 25th			0
as one frustrated @entity63 wittily put it : ’ they worked on their worse ball strategy for @entity96			0
’ @entity130 has fought back wonderfully following a first round 72 with back - to - back rounds of 66			2
even if he won the event it would be unlikely he would win the $ 10 million as well , but with $ 3 million going to the man who finishes second in the @entity30 and anyone in the top five claiming a seven - figure sum , he has set himself up for a massive payday on sunday			1
@entity40 kicks his club after hitting from the fairway on the 17th hole during the third round			0

@entity0 shot 67 in the third round to share the lead with @entity3
*rivals* will will fight it out for the @entity6 , the @entity7 and the tidy sum of $ 11.44 million
@entity39 , @entity38 , @entity37 and @entity36 in *chasing* pack
