by @entity0 published : 10:45 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 29 october 2013 could a t - shirt improve your posture ? the makers of the @entity6 t - shirt would certainly like you to believe so			1
their new t - shirt , designed in @entity9 , has just launched in the @entity10 and claims it can , ‘ through its innovative , patented , flexible ’ design which ‘ encourages the holding of the shoulders in a beautiful position ’ give you ‘ a dream posture			1
’ of course this is n't the first bit of kit designed to get us sitting upright with our shoulders back			0
a new t - shirt , called @entity6 , has just launched in the @entity10 and claims it can give you ' a dream posture ' last year @entity23 launched their £ 25 @entity25 posture bra , while @entity26 , £ 37.99 , is a slightly complicated looking strap and harness contraption that was originally developed to help horse riders sit up straight but has become popular with everyone from nurses to yoga fans			1
but this is the first time such technology has been put into a t - shirt			2
so how does it work ? from the outside it looks like a simple white cotton t - shirt but turn it inside out and you 'll find a stiffer blue fabric that 's bonded to the cotton in a pattern that goes across the top part of the back , over the shoulders and around the upper arms			1
the idea is that the stiffer fabric should sit flat against your back - as it will when you have your shoulder blades back and down , and your back flat			1
the company says that the t - shirt is made in @entity9 from very specialist materials using a very time - consuming process which , they maintain , justifies the £ 108 price but start to curve your back or bring your shoulders forward , and the stiffer fabric wo n't flex with you , so you feel some resistance across your back , shoulders and upper arms , sort of strait - jacket lite , if you will			1
apparently the t - shirt is ‘ most efficient when it is fitted ’ basically if you ’re undecided , opt for a smaller size			2
as i usually wear a 10 - 12 , i go for the @entity70 , which is equivalent to a 10			0
it 's nicely cut - although could do with being a little bit longer in the body - and just looks like a normal white t - shirt , albeit quite a tight one			2
i can feel it pulling across my shoulders - which is of course the point as it reminds me to pull my shoulders back			0
unfortunately - maybe because i 'm too easily distracted - the reminder does n't last for long			0
all too soon with an urgent email and a couple of phone calls vying for my attention , my shoulders are rounding and yes , while feeling the shirt pull across my back and at the tops of my arms is not terribly comfortable , it 's not so painful that it 's forefront of my mind			0
what is painful is the price - € 127 or a staggering £ 108			2
for that , i want something that 's going to give me the deportment of a ballerina who 's spent three years at a @entity100 finishing school , not something that allows me to slump back into my previous poor posture without much effort or discomfort			0
the company says that the t - shirt is made in @entity9 from very specialist materials using a very time - consuming process which , they maintain , justifies the price			1
personally , i 'm not convinced - maybe if your concentration is better than mine , or your bank balance is bigger , it 's a worthwhile investment , but with proven posture prompters that are less expensive , i wo n't be bending over to get my wallet out of my bag for this one			0
