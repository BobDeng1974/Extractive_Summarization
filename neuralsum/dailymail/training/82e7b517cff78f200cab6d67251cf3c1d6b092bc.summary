' we ’re friends and we were talking more than a year ago about a small capsule that would be @entity2 ’s eye and aesthetic but with the @entity5 style			0
' one pair of jewel - encrusted stilettos was inspired by a vintage @entity40 necklace belonging to ms @entity41 , and the collection also includes gladiator sandals , pumps , and a suede bootie , according to the publication			1
