by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 governor @entity2 treated a standing - room crowd to a stinging indictment of the @entity6 and its biggest names on thursday			1
and spectators at the @entity9 who saw him speak say the speech marked the beginning of a presidential campaign			1
' our ideas are better than their ideas , ' @entity2 said of political progressives in a speech that hit all the top - tier political hot buttons including abortion , organized labor , government entitlements adn the @entity24 administration 's economic policies			1
and he made a point of praising @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , the @entity31 governors of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 – all likely 2016 swing states where the eventual @entity31 nominee will spend considerable time			1
' for sure , he 's running , ' @entity9 attendee @entity38 , a @entity3 , told @entity39			1
' at this point , is there any doubt ? ' ' it 's really going to happen , ' said @entity44 , attending the event in his home state of @entity47			0
he put the odds of a @entity2 candidacy at ' about 80 per cent			2
all 20 said they expected him to get into the 2016 race for the @entity68			2
only three said they wished he would n't			0
it 's a stunning turnaround for a blue - state governor who was banned from last year 's @entity9 event because of his hearty embrace of president @entity24 , who worked to provide @entity3 with much - needed disaster aid after @entity76			1
on thursday , thousands of the nation 's most driven right - wingers gave him near - unanimous standing ovations both before and after his remarks			0
but @entity2 , bruised by a scandal involving allegedly intentional traffic jams targeting a mayor who opposed him , gave his adversaries more ammunition to use against him			2
without naming them directly , he gave an unmistakable defense of @entity90 , the liberal - incensing billionaire industrialists known for supporting conservative and libertarian causes			0
oops : the no - politicking rule is being loosely enforced at @entity9 this year possible contenders : @entity2 ( c ) bumped into @entity33 sen. @entity96 ( @entity97 ) in the vip area at @entity9 on thursday ; both could be @entity31 primary contenders two years from now a slimmer - than - before @entity2 appealed to anti-democrat sentiments , saying ' our ideas are better than theirs ' senate majority leader @entity103 lashed out at the @entity90 brothers this week on the @entity106 floor			1
' the oil baron @entity90 brothers are very good at protecting and growing their prodigious future and fortune , ' he said			0
' there ’s nothing un-american about that			0
but what is un-american is when shadowy billionaires pour unlimited money into our democracy to rig the system to benefit themselves and the wealthiest one percent			0
' @entity2 took @entity103 head - on and cast him as a cynical opponent of job - creators			1
' what they 're for in @entity54 , ' he said , is – the leader of the @entity52 stands up and rails against two @entity1 entrepreneurs			2
' ' @entity103 should get back to work , ' @entity2 jabbed , ' and stop railing against great @entity1 who are creating jobs			1
' ' the fact is , ' he added in a call to arms , ' that we have to take these guys on directly			0
' @entity2 committed one unforced error that may come back to haunt him : a claim that the @entity138 has never hosted a speaker who opposed abortion rights			2
the @entity9 crowd ranges in age from millennials to baby boomers , including some who yearn from the @entity147 ' @entity146 ' abortion is on the back - burner at @entity9 this year , failing to command a panel discussion or a keynote speech topic , but @entity2 brought it up in an attempt to paint @entity52 as ideologically rigid forgiven ? @entity2 was banned from last year 's cpac because he pumped up @entity24 's image in an election season following the flow of post-hurricane federal aid dollars ' at our national convention , we ’ve had people like @entity161 and @entity162 and @entity163 speak at our national conventions			1
even though i do n’t agree with their position on abortion , ' he said			0
' tell me , sir , ' @entity2 continued , recounting a conversation with a liberal constituent , ' the last pro-life @entity171 who was allowed to speak at a @entity6 convention ? by the way , do n’t strain yourself , because there ’s never been one			1
they ’re the party of intolerance , not us			2
' but @entity103 , the @entity106 majority leader from @entity182 , is pro-life			2
so are former louisiana democratic senator @entity183 and former @entity185 @entity184 of @entity34			0
all were frequent @entity138 speakers			0
@entity2 never mentioned @entity187 , one likely @entity6 presidential nominee , but set aside a minute of his time at the podium to attack president @entity24 's economic policies as ' the cold , hard hand of the government determining winners and losers			1
' ' we do n't have an income inequality problem ; we have an opportunity inequality problem , ' @entity2 said			1
he also lashed out at news outlets in a thinly veiled slap at the negative coverage his ' @entity204 ' scandal has brought			0
' we have to stop letting the media define who we are and what we stand for , ' he said to vigorous applause			0
both @entity209 and @entity210 cut away from the speech less than three minutes in .			0

@entity39 took an informal poll of 20 random @entity9 attendees who heard @entity2 speak : all 20 said he 's running for president
' our ideas are better than theirs , ' @entity2 said of @entity221
he praised the @entity31 governors of 2016 swing states and attacked president @entity24 for creating ' opportunity inequality ' in @entity1
@entity2 never mentioned @entity187 by name but defended the billionaire koch brothers against attacks from sen. @entity103
he made one *glaring* error , *incorrectly* claiming democrats are ' the party of intolerance ' because pro-life speakers have never addressed their *quadrennial* national convention
