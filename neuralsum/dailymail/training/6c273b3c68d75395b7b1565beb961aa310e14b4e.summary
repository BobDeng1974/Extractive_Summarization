@entity1 soldiers saw prisoners being hooded , given electric shocks and kept in cells the size of dog kennels for prolonged periods at @entity8 @entity1 troops working at a secretive @entity12 detention centre in @entity13 saw prisoners being given electric shocks , brutally beaten and locked in ‘ kennels ’ , it was claimed last night			1
for the first time , servicemen at the notorious @entity8 in @entity18 have spoken of how they saw @entity12 abuse and torture terror suspects			1
one captive had his false leg pulled off and was beaten around the head with it , they said			2
but when the troops complained about the treatment , a @entity27 officer said : ‘ you did n’t see that – do you understand ? ’ the claims will fuel suspicions that military chiefs and ministers turned a blind eye to the abuse			0
the allegations follow the scandal over @entity39 , a civilian beaten to death by @entity1 troops in @entity13 in 2003 and abuses at the @entity12 - run @entity45 prison			1
at @entity8 , two @entity47 squadrons and an @entity49 unit had guard and transport duties while @entity53 and @entity54 troops were based nearby			2
the joint @entity12 - @entity1 special forces unit , code - named @entity56 , worked to seize key insurgents.but few @entity1 personnel were allowed into the camp ’s interrogation area			1
this included a room with every surface painted black , where the worst abuses are said to have been carried out			0
@entity1 forces have told how they witnessed @entity13 prisoners being tortured in a secret @entity12 detention centre in @entity68 ( file photo ) on the tenth anniversary of the invasion of @entity13 , former @entity1 personnel have come forward			1
two @entity53 members told how they saw two @entity13 prisoners being tortured in an area run by @entity76 , the @entity12 special forces unit			1
one said : ‘ they were given electric shocks from cattle prods and their heads were held under the water in the swimming pool			0
’ witnesses said prisoners were held in cells the size of large dog kennels made of wire mesh and corrugated iron			0
@entity89 , who was defence secretary at the time , insisted he had no knowledge of @entity8 one told @entity91 : ‘ the prisoners were taken into a hangar to be bagged and tagged , a bag put over their heads and their hands plasticuffed behind their backs			2
they would be driven to the @entity97			0
they were in pretty poor shape when they were taken out			0
’ ' everyone 's seen the @entity45 pictures			0
but i 've seen it with my own eyes			0
' another former soldier said : ' i saw one man having his prosthetic leg being pulled off him , and being beaten about the head with it before he was thrown onto the truck			2
' suspects were brought to the secret prison at @entity68 , known as @entity8 for questioning by both @entity12 military and civilian interrogators			1
their methods were so brutal that they drew condemnation not only from a @entity12 human rights body but from a special investigator reporting to the @entity118			2
the @entity91 reports that @entity89 , defence secretary at the time , insisted he had no knowledge of the camp or the activities carried out there			0
when it was pointed out to him that the @entity1 military had provided transport services and a guard force , and had helped to detain @entity128 ’s inmates , he reportedly replied : ‘ i ’ve never heard of the place			1
’ in the same manner the @entity130 has repeatedly failed to address questions about ministerial approval of @entity1 operations at @entity8			1
nor would the department say whether ministers had been made aware of concerns about human rights abuses there			0
there is no suggestion @entity1 personnel carried out any abuse but questions have been raised about what ministers knew .			1

one serviceman says he saw a prisoner beaten with his prosthetic limb
