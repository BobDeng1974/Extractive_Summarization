@entity0 will aim to balance a refreshed team with a winning one when @entity2 , still reeling from the @entity4 loss at @entity5 , host @entity6 in the @entity8 third round on sunday			1
rather than send his front - line players into battle swiftly after a loss which saw @entity2 's @entity13 advantage wiped out , @entity0 is likely to rotate his options after an arduous festive schedule			1
' obviously we are going to rest a couple of players			1
that 's normal , ' he said			2
video @entity0 : @entity6 are a good team , but we 'll rest players @entity2 manager @entity0 has said he will rest a couple of players against @entity6 in the @entity8 @entity25 ( left ) could start against @entity6 , but goalkeeper @entity26 could miss out through injury ( right ) @entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) could feature against @entity6 after not playing at @entity5 @entity30 ( second right ) controls the ball in training as @entity33 ( second left ) closes him down @entity34 ( second left ) was training for @entity2 the day after their 5 - 3 defeat to @entity5 at @entity36 ' and give a chance to other people to play and to show ( what they can do )			1
' obviously we want to try to beat @entity6 , but at the same time we have to analyse the players ' condition and make the right decision for them			1
' striker @entity44 and forward @entity45 are among the front - line @entity2 players who could be rotated out of the starting @entity48 @entity49 could replace @entity26 in goal , depending on the severity of the latter 's finger injury , while @entity34 , @entity54 and @entity55 could also be afforded a rest after the 5 - 3 loss at @entity36			1
rather than turn to youth , like @entity59 , @entity60 or @entity61 , @entity0 is planning to field players who have been on the first - team periphery this term , like @entity25 , who has been hampered by a niggling groin injury , but remains an integral figure in the season run - in			1
' i have players from the first - team and players that we need to have in condition to play , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity25 is getting there step by step			0
he played 45 minutes ( against @entity5 )			0
' he 's a player we need and he 's a player we have n't had for the first part of the season			2
@entity49 could deputise in place of @entity26 if he is not fit to play against @entity6 striker @entity44 ( right ) could be one of the players rested against @entity6 by @entity0 @entity82 ( right ) takes on @entity30 ( centre ) in training as he looks to earn a start in the @entity8 @entity86 ( second right ) could feature against @entity6 as he was an unused substitute against @entity5 ' when we had him he was not really ready and finally he looks like he 's almost getting there			1
' @entity0 is still to ascertain the full extent of @entity26 ' finger problem , but has a more than capable deputy in @entity49 , who may have played anyway			1
the @entity94 boss added : ' he ( @entity26 ) has a problem in one of his fingers			1
let 's see what happens			2
' i do n't know ( if it 's broken )			2
i just asked if he could carry on at half - time ( at @entity5 )			0
' when @entity2 were unbeaten , eight points clear of @entity106 in the @entity13 and apparently cruising , thoughts of some turned to a quadruple quest			0
now , with a championship title battle in full swing , the @entity8 could be deemed a distraction , but @entity0 's approach remains			1
' it 's impossible to go for one trophy , or two , or three , or four , ' he said			2
' it 's only possible to go for the next match			2
and the next match is @entity8 and we want to try to win the @entity8			1
@entity0 ( centre ) denied that the @entity8 is a distraction for @entity2 , and said he wants to win the trophy @entity121 ( centre ) has demanded a response from @entity2 after a 5 - 3 defeat to @entity5 on thursday @entity125 ( centre ) scored @entity106 's winner as they moved level on points with @entity2 ' we do n't choose competitions			1
we choose the next match and the next match is against @entity6			1
and it 's an important match			0
' it 's a difficult game			0
it 's a good team , one of the best teams in the @entity136			0
' we have the experience of the difficulties against teams like @entity140 , @entity141 , teams that we played already this season			0
' they have a good team			0
they did n't play this @entity149 fixture			0
' they will go to try to beat us , so we need to be alert because the game is going to be difficult			0
' @entity121 hopes @entity2 will respond to seeing their advantage over defending @entity13 champions @entity106 evaporate			0
@entity125 , a team - mate of @entity121 's for 13 seasons at @entity155 , scored to earn last season 's league winners victory over @entity158 before @entity2 's defeat at @entity5			0
' it 's hard to see them claw us back , ' @entity121 said on chelseafc.com			0
@entity0 criticised the performance of referee @entity166 ( centre ) after the defeat to @entity5 @entity54 ( centre ) may face disciplinary reaction for kicking @entity5 striker @entity170 ( second right ) ' we were eight points in front and now we 're level on points			2
' it 's disappointing to have lost that lead but we said in the dressing room we 'll come together , put a run together and hopefully get a lead again			0
' the defeat could have many ramifications , not least for the title race and @entity0 , who invited scrutiny on the performance of referee @entity166 at @entity36 and could face @entity185 disciplinary action			2
@entity54 could also be punished retrospectively for kicking @entity5 striker @entity170 in the back .			0

@entity0 will rest a ' a couple of players ' against @entity6 in the third round of the @entity8
goalkeeper @entity26 could be ruled out *due* to a finger injury , so @entity49 is ready to deputise
@entity0 would like to play @entity196 so he can contiue his *comeback* , but the club 's *youngsters* could miss out
