world poverty is shrinking and developing countries are becoming less poor according to a new study by @entity3			1
@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 were the ' star performers ' of the 22 - country study carried out by the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , followed by @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the report predicts that some of the poorest countries in the world could see acute poverty eradicated within 20 years			1
the department measured poverty by using a new term called the @entity24 , or @entity25			2
it measures the intensity of different deprivations that poor people face including nutrition , education and sanitation and not just income			0
researchers have devised a new term for measuring poverty called the @entity24 which is shown along the bottom of the graph			2
the lighter bar shows the original @entity25 and the darker bar shows the current @entity25 if people are deprived in a third or more of ten indicators , the global index identifies them as ' @entity25 poor '			0
the study was carried out by dr @entity46 and dr @entity47			0
dr @entity46 said : ' using this measure , we found that reductions in intensity – the percentage of deprivations people experience at the same time – were strongest in relatively poorer countries , such as @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
' in some countries , if progress continues at the same rate , current generations may see the end of acute multidimensional poverty			1
if people are deprived in a third or more of ten indicators , the global index identifies them as ' @entity25 poor ' for example , if the study ’s ' star ' countries , @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6 , continue to reduce poverty at the current rate , they will halve @entity25 in less than 10 years and eradicate it in 20			1
however , the future for other countries does not look as positive			0
‘ at the current rate of reduction , it will take @entity57 45 years to halve multidimensional poverty ; in other words , to achieve poverty levels equivalent to those @entity84 has now , ’ said @entity11 ’s dr @entity77 , who calculated the predictions			1
‘ based on the same assumptions , it will take @entity87 41 years and @entity58 74 years to eradicate acute poverty as measured by the @entity25			1
' but we hope that by providing a more complete and balanced picture , these measures will help spur the eradication of multidimensional poverty			0
’ improvements : @entity4 did the best in areas like nutrition and child mortality @entity4 did the best in areas like nutrition , child mortality , electricity , improved flooring and assets			2
@entity5 showed the biggest improvement in sanitation and water , and @entity6 did best in improving sanitation and school attendance			1
the @entity25 can also be broken down to reveal the varying rates of progress in different regions of a country or among different social groups			0
for example , in @entity4 , although it had an outstanding overall performance , three of the 13 regions lagged behind the rest of the country , with no statistically significant reduction in @entity25 poverty			1
by contrast , @entity5 and @entity6 achieved significant reductions in both the scale and intensity of multidimensional poverty in every one of their regions			1
‘ this ability of the @entity25 to reveal inequalities at a regional level , as well as between social groups , makes it a vital tool for policymakers , ’ said dr @entity127 , one of @entity11 ’s research team			0
‘ the global @entity25 allows us to compare people ’s poverty and see in what ways they are deprived , in order to address these interconnected deprivations and target interventions more accurately			0
’ the release of the report on changes in poverty over time follows the publication of the @entity25 in the @entity150 's human development report 2013			2
in 2013 , @entity11 found that a total of 1.6billion people are living in multidimensional poverty - more than 30 per cent of the combined populations of the 104 countries analysed			2
it is the first time research has tracked overlapping deprivations in health , education and living standards .			0

poverty levels in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have *dropped*
