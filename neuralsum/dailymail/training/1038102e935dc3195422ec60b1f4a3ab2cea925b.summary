@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 is expected to be recalled by @entity2 on sunday for the opening game of their @entity5 title defence , but is still waiting for a new contract offer from the champions with less than two years left on his current deal			1
city boss @entity9 has moved quickly to reassure 27 - year - old @entity0 about his position even though he was left out of last weekend ’s @entity12 clash with @entity13			0
after @entity2 ’s 3 - 0 defeat at @entity15 with @entity16 in goal , @entity9 is leaning towards starting with the tried and tested @entity0 for their first league match at @entity20			1
number one : @entity0 is expected to start in goal for @entity2 against @entity20 on sunday tough battle : @entity0 will have to fight off competition from new @entity2 team - mate @entity16 @entity0 has been @entity2 ’s regular goalkeeper in both their @entity5 titles in the last three seasons but his longer - term future is less certain			1
although @entity2 mentioned the possibility of a new contract offer at the end of last season , nothing has been discussed since , with the club prioritising the signatures of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 on long - term teals			0
striker @entity40 is expected to follow suit shortly			0
@entity0 ’s current contract runs until 2016 and @entity2 will have to consider their options before the end of the year as the player ’s transfer value will start to decrease the nearer it gets to the end of the term			1
he would probably cost around £ 30million in the current transfer market			0
decision maker : @entity9 will decide who will start in goal for @entity2 in their league opener @entity0 , who signed for @entity2 from @entity55 before they were under @entity57 ownership , is happy on and off the pitch in @entity59 but will be glad to given the nod by @entity9 to start the league season			2
he joined @entity2 ’s pre-season tour of the @entity63 late after playing for @entity1 at the @entity64 but put in an impressive 45 - minute performance against @entity66 in @entity67			2
@entity0 is regarded as one of the most commanding goalkeepers in @entity70 but @entity9 decided to sign £ 6million @entity71 from his former club @entity72 because he is a fan of the @entity74 ’s kicking ability			0
@entity71 is renowned as a good “ keeper sweeper ” but strayed from his line too often in the defeat against @entity13			0
@entity2 probable team : @entity0 - @entity79 , @entity36 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85			1

the @entity1 goalkeeper is expected to start for @entity2 against @entity20
@entity2 custodian @entity0 has two years left on his current deal
