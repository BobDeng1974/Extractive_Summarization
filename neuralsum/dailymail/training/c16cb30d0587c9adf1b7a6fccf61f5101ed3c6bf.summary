by @entity1 reporter the number of pets being put down in animal shelters across the @entity5 has declined dramatically in the past four decades			1
according to the @entity9 , the number of dogs and cats being euthanized today is about one - fifth of what it was in the 1970s			1
that 's even as the number of pets in the country is booming from 64 million to 160 million over the same time period			1
tiny orphans : chihuahuas make up about a third of the dogs at many @entity22 animal shelters ' they were euthanizing about 15 million pets back in 1970 , ' @entity23 , vice president of companion animals at the @entity9 told @entity27			1
' we ’re now down to about three million every year			2
of course , that ’s three million too many			0
but that is tremendous progress that ’s been made over the last four decades			0
' @entity33 grassroots spay and neuter campaigns have also helped to reduce the number of unwanted pets			1
@entity23 says a major part of the reduction is societal attitudes towards pets			0
' i mean pets are really considered part of the family , ' @entity23 told @entity27			0
' and that has been a shift over the many decades where maybe pets were a little more utilitarian			0
' another factor is better coordination among animal welfare organizations to try and keep animals out of shelters			2
still too high : about 50 per cent of the animals that enter shelters are euthanized changing attitudes : people now think of animals as a part of their family , rather than something more utilitarian , says @entity23 although the number of pets entering shelters has fallen , 50 per cent that do enter are euthanized			1
@entity27 reports that in the @entity68 area , a non-profit organization called @entity69 is seeking to help both pet owners and animal shelters			1
' what we found was that so many of the calls from the people who wanted to surrender their pets , they did n’t actually want to surrender their pets , ' @entity72 , @entity69 ’s community outreach director , told @entity27			2
' they may have had some financial hardship where they could n’t afford dog food			0
they may have had a fence complaint where the dog was getting out			0
' @entity69 will help pet owners in any way they can to keep the animal out of the shelter , from providing donated pet food to mending fences			2
the organization has also helped shelters to reduce their euthanasia rates by organizing pet drives in shopping malls and other high - traffic areas .			0

the number of dog and cats being euthanized has *dropped* dramatically in the past *40* years
in the 1970s , the number of pets in the @entity5 was 64 million and 15 million per year were euthanized
today there are *164* million pets but only three million per year are euthanized
this is *due* to spay and neuter campaigns and changing attitudes towards pets
@entity69 is seeking to take the number of euthanized pets down to zero
the organizations helps animals stay out of shelters by helping *struggling* owners
