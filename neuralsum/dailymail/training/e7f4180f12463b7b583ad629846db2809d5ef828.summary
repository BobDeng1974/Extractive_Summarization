there is a new contender for dumbest criminal after a group of young men dragged stolen , flaming port - a - loos behind their car and seemed surprised by the nauseating stench that ensued			1
the less - than - smooth criminals then further proved their ignorance by incriminating themselves ; catching the attention of police by posting footage of their faecal fiasco on @entity14			1
the young men attached chains to two port - a - loos during the dead of night and then took off at great speed , with the portable toilets banging into each other and spilling waste all over the road			1
the culprits follow the ute filming the disgusting , dangerous antics			2
the hooligans can be heard guffawing and retching as they speed through the @entity43 , overcome by the putrid stench as the container of waste catches alight			1
‘ i can smell sh * * , oh @entity49 ! ’ the voice can be heard yelling in surprise			0
others yell excitedly , giggling so hard that their exclamations are inaudible			0
the flaming toilets tumble , knocking over street signs and upending any objects which came in their path			0
proving no lesson had been learnt , the @entity58 tried again , stealing another port - a - loo			2
‘ sh * * got everywhere ! ’ they can be heard squealing			0

@entity80 superintendent @entity79 says he is well aware of the crime , thanks to the criminals conveniently uploading footage of their stupid stunt , according to @entity86			2
