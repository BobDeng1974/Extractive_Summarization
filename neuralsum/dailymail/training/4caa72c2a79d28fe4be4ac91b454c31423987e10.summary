cricket ’s moral code is mazy at the best of times but it has rarely appeared more complex than in the mixed reaction to the controversial and unusual ‘ @entity4 ’ of @entity5 by @entity6 at @entity7			1
opinions among pundits and the public seem evenly divided on whether @entity11 was within his rights to run @entity5 out backing up and , more pertinently , whether @entity13 should have withdrawn the appeal			1
your gut instinct as a cricket lover to any ‘ spirit of the game ’ issue is as good a means as any of deciding your viewpoint			0
my mind was made up as soon as @entity25 raised his finger in the deciding one - day international			0
it felt that way then and it still does now after much contemplation			0
' @entity32 ' : @entity5 ( right ) is run out backing up by @entity11 , sparking a storm of controversy flashpoint : @entity37 captain @entity36 ( left ) lectures @entity6 skipper @entity13 ( second right ) as @entity38 ( right ) and @entity39 also get involved at @entity7 this is not a case of simply backing @entity37 and i am fully aware that @entity6 had warned @entity5 and broke no laws or regulations			1
but ‘ @entity48 ’ feels different from any issue of non-walking or other run - out controversies			2
for instance , i strongly criticised @entity37 for not calling @entity50 back when he was run out at @entity51 in 2008 after colliding with @entity52			1
there was just no way they could justify that piece of poor sportsmanship			0
i also felt that @entity58 had no need to call @entity38 back at @entity60 three years ago because he had been dozy in the extreme in wandering off for tea when it was unclear that the ball had crossed the boundary and was dead			1
yet i had no issue with @entity68 ’s non-walk in last year ’s ashes and feel that selective walking , as we have seen from some big figures in the game ’s history who have shamefully claimed the moral high ground , is a bigger offence			1
leading question : @entity36 and @entity13 had words at the end following the @entity83 skipper 's decision not to call @entity5 back following the controversial ' @entity32 ' confusing ? well , yes , but each incident has to be treated on its merits			1
so why is this one so bad ? in his distinctive way , @entity87 hit the nail on the head when he tweeted : ‘ i did a @entity32 on @entity91 against @entity92			0
it was given out but my dad told me he wished i was adopted , he was so disgusted			0
’ the reaction of @entity95 is one that will resonate with any coach or schoolteacher in charge of a youth game			0
parents : what would you say if your kid ‘ mankaded ’ someone in their next game and then said , ‘ it ’s ok , i saw it on tv in @entity37 ’s match ? ’ i hope you would put them up for adoption as @entity87 almost was , because it is unedifying and shabby			2
the biggest irony , of course , is that @entity58 withdrew a @entity32 appeal in a one - day international two years ago			2
who were the opponents ? @entity6			2
who was at the crease ? @entity13			0
yet that did nothing to influence the @entity83 captain , even though he was surrounded by senior players when @entity25 asked him if he wanted to withdraw the appeal			0
you 've got to go : umpire @entity25 ( left ) gives @entity5 out after his run out by @entity11 ( right ) what is clear is that the incident has added spice to the test series			1
@entity36 said @entity6 had crossed a line and that there would be a hangover at next week ’s first test at @entity136 , but it was the press conference which followed @entity36 ’s on tuesday night that was most illuminating			2
the highly respected and experienced @entity139 bristled on behalf of his captain , his team and , significantly , his bowler @entity11			0
the key to this issue is that @entity6 feel wronged over the reporting of @entity11 for a suspect bowling action and that , i believe , led them to running out @entity5 in the way they did			1
the inference is that they suspect an @entity153 conspiracy against @entity11 and there was implied criticism of umpire @entity156 from @entity6 team manager @entity157 , who was alongside @entity139 at @entity7			1
clearly , two simmering teams will head to @entity159 ’s next week			0
against the spirit of the game : @entity50 ( left ) should have been called by by @entity37 following his run out after this collision with @entity52 in 2008 @entity37 may have lost only 3 - 2 against the world ’s most consistently successful limited - overs team but much of their batting was old - fashioned and formulaic , while a lot of the seam bowling lacked discipline and penetration			1
while @entity37 laboured at @entity7 , @entity171 was smashing 18 fours and six sixes in his 167 for @entity174 at @entity175			1
he really does need to be included in a one - paced @entity37 50 - over top four before another @entity176 comes and goes with a minimal @entity153 contribution			2
@entity171 force : @entity174 opener @entity171 hit 18 fours and six sixes in his 167 against @entity180 in the championship			0

@entity5 run out backing up , which sparked controversy at @entity7
incident could lead to bad blood between @entity37 and @entity6 in @entity188
@entity5 incident different to @entity50 run out in 2008 or @entity38 being called back by @entity58 in 2011
each incident must be *judged* on its own merit - no *problem* with @entity68 's non-walk at @entity60 in @entity195
@entity6 feel there 's a conspiracy against @entity11
