not going : president and mrs. @entity1 wo n't make the trip to @entity3 , in what is seen as a huge snub to @entity7 president @entity6 president @entity1 , vice president @entity8 , and their families will skip the opening or closing ceremonies of the @entity13 in @entity3 , @entity7 , breaking with recent tradition that has seen very senior @entity16 officials in attendance when athletes from around the world arrive for competition			1
the move will be seen as a snub of @entity7 president @entity6 , since the last four @entity23 saw far more senior administration officials in attendance			2
and adding to the in - your - face decision , the @entity26 will include an openly gay athlete , @entity29 , among its luminaries when the @entity32 games open – in defiance of @entity7 's new national anti-gay laws			1
the last time an @entity35 kicked off without an @entity26 president , vice president , first lady or former president in attendance was 2000 , when the event was held in @entity42 , @entity43			1
first lady @entity1 went to @entity44 in 2012 for the opening of the @entity23			0
in 2010 , vice president @entity8 led the @entity26 delegation at the ceremonies in @entity49 , @entity50			1
and then - president @entity51 traveled halfway around the world to @entity53 , @entity54 when the summer games opened there in 2008			0
former president @entity56 lobbied @entity51 to boycott the @entity53 games , criticizing @entity54 's reaction to violence in @entity60 and its inaction in the face of genocide in @entity64			0
but @entity51 ultimately decided to attend			0
the @entity16 announced tuesday afternoon that the official delegations for the @entity3 opening and closing ceremonies will include @entity26 ambassador to @entity7 @entity69 , @entity16 deputy chief of staff for policy @entity70 and deputy secretary of state @entity71			1
no one from the first family of the @entity8 family was included , nor was any current member of the president 's cabinet			0
@entity26 sports luminaries joining the group at the opening ceremonies will include tennis legend @entity29 and figure skating gold medalist @entity112			2
@entity1 's delegation to the closing ceremonies in @entity3 will include speed skaters @entity115 and @entity117 , along with women 's ice hockey star @entity118			2
the presence of the openly gay @entity29 on feb. 7 in @entity3 is likely a direct slam on @entity7 's anti-homosexuality laws ; but @entity124 , who leads @entity7 's @entity13 organizing committee , has said there will be no repercussions against athletes who wear rainbow pins or show other small - scale disdain for the government policy			1
slighted : @entity7 president @entity6 wo n't see his @entity26 counterpart in @entity3 , or anyone within arm 's reach of the @entity26 president flag - waver - in - chief : president @entity51 brought his whole family -- including his dad , former president @entity139 -- to the @entity140 in @entity53 , @entity54 first lady @entity141 went to @entity142 , @entity143 in 2006 to lead the @entity26 delegation for the @entity13 , but this time the highest - ranking official will be from the @entity146 in june @entity7 's parliament passed legislation banning what it called ' propaganda ' about gay lifestyles , which it terms ' nontraditional sexual relations			1
' lawmakers said the measure was required in order to protect the well - being of children			0
@entity7 president @entity6 has banned demonstrations and organized protests during , before and immediately after the @entity23			0
but the @entity161 has decided to designate ' protest zones ' in @entity3 – likely far away from tv cameras – in order to funnel discontent into a manageable area			0
tensions with @entity7 reached a boiling point this year after national security leaker @entity169 fled there with what administration officials now admit were ' millions ' of state secrets			1
@entity6 has granted him temporary asylum , and the @entity26 government is resisting calls to offer him an amnesty in exchange for the secure return of the intelligence he stole			0
the elephant in the dacha : @entity184 leaker @entity169 is still in @entity7 , and the @entity26 is none too pleased that president @entity6 has given him temporary asylum			2

the openly gay @entity26 tennis icon @entity29 will be in attendance , in a slam on @entity7 's anti-gay laws *enacted* this year
the @entity193 *marked* the last time the @entity26 was n't represented by a president , vice president , first lady or former president
the @entity169 affair has added new tensions to @entity26 - @entity7 relations
@entity146 officials and a @entity16 deputy will lead the president 's delegation to @entity3 in february
