it started as a corner shop herbalist in @entity2 in 1849 , and grew to become one of the most recognisable names on the @entity6 high street			1
now boots the chemist is the latest home - grown brand to be sold off to an @entity10 firm – in a deal worth nearly £ 6billion			1
@entity10 giant @entity12 already owns a 45 per cent stake in the @entity6 chain , which it acquired for £ 4billion in 2012			1
it is now set to buy the remaining 55 per cent to become the sole owner			1
end of an era : boots is the latest @entity6 brand to be sold off to a @entity10 firm – in a deal worth nearly £ 6billion boots is the latest in a long line of well - known @entity6 brands to be sold off to foreign companies			1
@entity10 supermarket chain @entity25 took over @entity27 in 1999 , while @entity28 has been owned by @entity10 firm @entity29 since 2010			2
@entity31 tycoon @entity30 , the chairman of @entity19 , is set to make around £ 1.5billion from the deal			1
he and private equity firm @entity33 have owned the business since 2007			0
@entity12 and boots have developed several joint initiatives over the past two years – for example , @entity19 ’ popular @entity38 anti-ageing serums have been sold in the @entity10 by @entity12 stores			1
it is now possible the @entity6 outlets will stock more @entity10 brands , and may introduce @entity10 - style health screening clinics to allow customers to test their blood glucose or cholesterol levels			2
@entity12 bosses are planning a major cost - cutting exercise designed to save £ 594million by 2017 , however it is unclear how this will affect the @entity6 firm ’s 70,000 staff and 2,500 stores			2
mr @entity30 , 73 , will be appointed executive vice chairman of the new business , called @entity57			1
he has described the deal as more of a ‘ merger ’ than an @entity10 takeover , adding that several @entity6 executives from @entity19 have already been given high - profile jobs by @entity12			1
he said : ‘ i strongly believe that the merger will bring significant growth opportunities for both mature and emerging markets			0
‘ today ’s announcement reflects the great track record and accomplishments of our people to date and i am convinced that their skills , expertise and commitment will continue to make a positive contribution			0
’ the sale will mean the @entity10 retailer owns more than 11,000 shops in 12 countries , as well as the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution network in the world			2
@entity12 ’ @entity10 boss , @entity83 , will run the new company as president and chief executive			1
like boots , @entity12 began as a single pharmacy			2
it was opened in 1901 by @entity90 @entity89 , and by 1919 had expanded to 20 stores selling food and drink as well as medicines			0
much of its early success stemmed from selling whiskey on prescription during the prohibition era			0
@entity12 has come under fire for continuing to stock tobacco products alongside medicines , but the company claims this means it is more readily able to offer customers advice and products to help them quit smoking			2
when the deal was in its early stages , some suggested that @entity12 planned to move its headquarters from the @entity10 to @entity6 in order to save on corporation tax			1
but the firm has said this is not the case , and it will remain based at its current site in @entity116			0
boots ’ head office will stay in @entity2 , where the business was founded in 1849 by farm worker @entity120 , a methodist who felt strongly about the need to make medicines available to the poor			1
when he died in 1860 aged 45 , his wife @entity126 and son @entity128 took over the chain			0
by 1890 , it had grown to more than 200 stores			0
... but it could mean less queueing and cheaper medicines by @entity134 , associate city editor long queues to pick up a prescription at @entity19 could be a thing of the past after the chemist ’s merger with @entity12			1
the @entity10 giant , which has more than 8,000 outlets across the @entity10 , is more advanced when it comes to the technology it uses to run its pharmacy counters			2
thanks to the superior systems , waiting times are usually shorter and pharmacists do not need to spend as much time rummaging around on the shelves behind the counter to find medicines			0
end of this headache ? customers wait to be served in a boots branch at @entity156 , @entity157 boots in the @entity6 could also copy @entity12 ’ pharmacy apps			1
one allows customers to get a repeat prescription by scanning their medicine ’s barcode on a smartphone			0
they can then pick up their order in just 30 minutes			0
at flagship @entity12 shops , there is also a no - appointment - needed doctor service , which could be replicated here			0
the @entity10 pharmacies offer many more vaccinations , including those for travellers going to exotic locations			0
if boots began offering these services , it would save @entity6 customers the inconvenience of a trip to the doctor ’s surgery for a jab			0
in the longer term , @entity19 ’ @entity10 deal could lead to cheaper drugs , thanks to a separate partnership it has forged with a @entity10 wholesaler called @entity189			1
after the @entity19 - @entity12 merger they will be able to hand in medicine orders together , putting them in a very strong position to achieve the lowest prices			1
combined , the pair will be the biggest purchaser of non-patent drugs on the planet			0
and the traffic is not all one way			0
while @entity19 is a mid-market staple of the @entity6 shopping scene , pharmacies in the @entity10 are an entirely different matter			1
‘ drugstores ’ are typically cheap and cheerful bazaars where toiletries and vitamin pills nestle next to cheap electronic goods , lurid cuddly toys and even fridges full of beer			0
when it comes to cosmetics , drugstores offer budget brands , usually with no testers or ladies in white coats to advise			0
women wanting a more upmarket experience have to head for the glitzy department stores and pay top dollar for designer lotions and potions			0
but @entity19 is set to bring a slice of the @entity6 high street to @entity12 , launching wider ranges of its well - known brands including @entity38 and @entity230 in @entity10 stores , and recruiting in - house beauty advisers			1
it will sell well - loved products such as @entity38 lipsticks to @entity10 women , and remodel @entity12 stores along @entity6 lines			2
finally , @entity6 customers will be relieved to learn that the advantage loyalty card will not be affected by the merger , and that the familiar ‘ three for two ’ offers on @entity19 products will continue as normal .			2

@entity10 chain @entity12 is set to buy the 55 per cent of @entity19 is does *n't* yet own
@entity31 tycoon @entity30 , @entity19 chairman , set to make abound £ 1.5bn
boots ’ hq will stay in @entity2 , where business was founded in 1849
