our guide shouts : ‘ do you know what culture is ? ’ to a group of rowdy @entity3 trying to climb a column in the gladiators ’ arena			2
before they can answer , he adds : ‘ i do n’t think you do			2
’ we are just starting our tour of @entity12 , and it is already obvious that @entity14 runs a tight ship			1
when @entity20 erupted ( ‘ how far away is @entity20 ? i already told you			2
’ ) on august 24 , ad 79 , the explosion was the equivalent of two atomic bombs being detonated			0
blast from the past : @entity12 , where the @entity22 recalls former glories , is a wonderful site anyone who did not escape the ash was asphyxiated			1
‘ they had a few minutes when they knew their fate , ’ @entity14 informs us solemnly			0
one of the remarkable plaster - cast bodies that were formed using the spaces these unfortunate souls left in the earth when they shrank to nothing — displayed in a glass cabinet — shows a contorted man on his back , with his hands up in front of him			1
his terror is almost palpable			0
there are only nine of us on this escorted tour with @entity46 , which is a refreshingly intimate luxury as @entity48 reveals @entity12 ’s sophistication			1
it was built on a grid , with roads running north to south and east to west - with stepping stones across the main street to help pedestrians avoid cascading water			2
much maligned : @entity58 has a reputation for grime and crime - but few cities have a more picturesque setting they also built vaulted ceilings at the public baths ( so condensation did not drip on people having massages ) , bakeries on most street corners and ornate houses			1
they even used to write graffiti			0
these flourishes of street art have modern - day echoes in @entity58 , the starting point for our tour , a 15 - mile hop from @entity12			1
almost every space on the city ’s pastel - coloured buildings has been used as an informal canvas			1
@entity58 is known for grime , but it can be enthralling , its narrow lanes packed with people , beeping mopeds and laundry hanging from balconies			1
our group get along well			0
we also have plenty of time to ourselves and do n’t eat every meal together , so it never feels like a school trip			0
here 's one i made earlier : @entity100 emerges from her cookery class at @entity102 , clutching an @entity104 cake - and perhaps still wondering about her encounter with a naked @entity106 in @entity58 ( not the one shown here ) the @entity108 is a wonderful @entity58 oddity — an alley where @entity111 is a permanent affair			1
little workshops sell festive figurines , although i struggle to grasp how the naked statuette of @entity106 ( or the , thankfully , clothed @entity115 ) could be a seasonal bauble			0
we are all awestruck when we enter the @entity118 and glimpse its marble centrepiece , @entity120 ( the @entity121 ) , carved in 1753 by @entity122			0
we move on to @entity102 in @entity123			0
perfectly positioned for a trip to the nearby ruined @entity127 temples at @entity128 , it is part of @entity130 ’s 250 - acre buffalo farm			2
she turned this cluster of stone buildings into a haven for rural tourism in 1991			0
come explore : @entity58 has many intriguing districts - like the @entity137 - that many visitors never see @entity102 also features a splendid old farmhouse , the @entity140			1
here , the @entity130 and her kitchen staff give us a cooking lesson , making ricotta - filled ravioli , @entity104 cake , sublime pizza and fried mozzarella			2
i eat my bodyweight in carbohydrates , and we tour the farm			0
the buffalo are docile and curious			0
one licks my foot with a giant grey tongue as the cows queue to be milked			0
as we return to the house we see that a calf has just been born			0
its innocent expression is the exact opposite of the frightened faces frozen in time at @entity12			1
@entity162 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies from @entity163 to @entity58 from £ 78 return			1
a seven - day tour of @entity58 , @entity166 , @entity12 and the @entity167 with @entity46 ( 020 8987 0990 , www.backroadstouring.co.uk ) starts at £ 1,545 per person .			1

@entity12 , while well known , remains one of @entity172 's most *spectacular* sites
@entity58 is a city known for crime and grime - but has many *lovely* corners
the city also boasts a year - round @entity111 market selling *naughty* baubles
