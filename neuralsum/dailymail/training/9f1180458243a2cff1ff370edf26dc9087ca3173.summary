in the escalating battle of big data vs. human experts , score another win for numbers			0
the most accurate predictions of which movies the @entity8 will deem ' culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant ' are not the views of critics or fans but a simple algorithm applied to a database , researchers have found			1
the crucial data , scientists reported in @entity16 , are what the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) calls ' connections ' - films , television episodes and other works that allude to an earlier movie			1
by the 25 - year - lag rule , the 1971 box - office disappointment ' @entity24 ' should be in the registry : @entity17 lists 52 long - lag citations to it , the 37th most in @entity30 analysis			1
in december , six months after the scientists submitted theirpaper , the @entity8 added ' @entity33 ' to the list of 650cinematic immortals , just as the research predicted			2
the number of references to a film more than 25 years after its in the @entity17 database release was a nearly infallible predictor of whether itwould make the registry , topping 91 percent accuracy , saidapplied mathematician and study author @entity45			1
for 15,425 films in @entity17 examined in the study , the measure that was most predictive of which made it into the @entity8 's @entity52 , which honors ' significant ' movies , was the number of references to it by other films released many years later			1
the 1972 classic ' @entity61 , ' for instance , is referred to by 1,323 films and television episodes , which as recently as 2014 quoted the ' offer he ca n't refuse ' line , referred to the famous horse - head scene , or played the theme music , for instance			0
' @entity61 ' made the registry in 1990			0
the number of references to a film more than 25 years after its release was a nearly infallible predictor of whether it would make the registry , topping 91 percent accuracy , said applied mathematician and study author @entity77 of @entity79			0
critics ' judgments , @entity83 wins , and box - office numbers did not come close			1
films are nominated for the registry by the public and chosen by the @entity88 in consultation with a board of experts including critics , academics , directors , screenwriters and other industry insiders			0
by the 25 - year - lag rule , the 1971 box - office disappointment ' @entity24 ' should be in the registry : @entity17 lists 52 long - lag citations to it , the 37th most in the @entity79 analysis			1
in december , six months after the scientists submitted their paper , the @entity8 added ' @entity33 ' to the list of 650 cinematic immortals , just as the research predicted			2
the end of the @entity83 ? critics ' judgments , @entity83 wins , and box - office numbers didnot come close to the algorithm , the study found			1
' experts have biases that can affect how they evaluate things , ' said physicist and co-author @entity117 of @entity79			0
' automated , objective methods do n't suffer from that			0
it may hurt our pride , but they can perform as well as or better than experts			0
' other movies identified by the @entity79 algorithm as likely to make the @entity52 include ' @entity127 , ' ' @entity128 ' and ' @entity129			2
' of course , humans are not entirely superfluous : flesh - and - blood creators must decide to refer to an earlier gem in order to establish the crucial @entity17 ' connections			2

team used algorithm to analyse the @entity17 database
analysed connections between film and others
able to predict better than humans which movies made it into the @entity8 's @entity52 for ' significant ' films
predicted the 1971 box - office disappointment ' @entity24 ' should be in the registry - six months before it was added
