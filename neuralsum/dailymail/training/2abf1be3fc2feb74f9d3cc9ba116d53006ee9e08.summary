the pr executive who was summarily dismissed after her racist @entity1 sparked a revolt on social media has apologised - as her own father called her a ‘ f * * * * * * idiot ’			1
@entity7 said that she was ‘ ashamed ’ over her actions and said she had been ‘ cavalier ’ in making her tasteless joke about the @entity11 crisis in @entity12 but her father , who has not been publicly named , was more forthright and said that what she did was ‘ unforgivable ’			1
flying into the storm : this photo , snapped by @entity1 user @entity17 , was taken as @entity7 got off a 12 hour flight at @entity21 airport after arriving from @entity22			1
the pr representative would have just been discovering the furor her racist @entity1 had created while she was in the air he also apparently backed the campaign to name and shame his daughter as , in an ironic twist , it emerged he moved his family from @entity21 to the @entity31 in 1994 to escape racism at the end of @entity34			1
@entity7 is now thought to be holed up with her family in @entity12 and will be spending @entity36 coming to terms with her sudden ascent to the @entity40 's public enemy no.1			1
losing her job as a communications director could also mean losing her @entity31 work visa - potentially forcing her to leave @entity31			0
@entity7 was fired by @entity44 , a major @entity31 media company which owns @entity45 and @entity46 , after she sent the tweet as she was about to board a 12 - hour flight from @entity22 to @entity21			1
it read : ‘ going to @entity12			2
hope i do n't get @entity50			2
i 'm @entity51 ! ' the post was retweeted over 3,000 times and was picked up by media outlets around the world , however @entity7 remained completely unaware of it all because she was in the air			1
the blonde publicist was pictured arriving in @entity21 looking shocked and talking on her phone			0
moments later the offending @entity1 and @entity7 's @entity1 account disappeared - and @entity44 announced it had fired her			1
now she has apologised in a statement released to @entity62 , a @entity12 newspaper			2
it read : ‘ my greatest concern was this statement reach @entity12 first			2
‘ words can not express how sorry i am , and how necessary it is for me to apologize to the people of @entity12 , who i have offended due to a needless and careless tweet			2
‘ there is an @entity11 crisis taking place in this country , that we read about in @entity31 , but do not live with or face on a continuous basis			2
unfortunately , it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand			0
‘ for being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not discriminate by race , gender or sexual orientation , but which terrifies us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus , i am ashamed			0
@entity7 has no idea her offensive tweet made the news because she is on a flight to @entity12 career suicide : @entity44 says that they will take ' appropriate action ' against the tweet sent by @entity7 ( pictured above in shots from her @entity97 account ) with the high powered executive likely to lose her job ‘ this is my father 's country , and i was born here			1
i cherish my ties to @entity12 and my frequent visits , but i am in anguish knowing that my remarks have caused pain to so many people here ; my family , friends and fellow @entity12			1
i am very sorry for the pain i caused			0
’ twitter user @entity111 , who lives in @entity21 , had been so astonished by the story when it erupted he went to the airport to meet @entity7 where he spoke to her family			2
he tweeted : ‘ @entity7 's dad is apologeti & basically in tears			1
" i decided to raise her in the @entity31			0
@entity12 was too racist "			2
oh , the irony ! ’ @entity111 also said that @entity7 ’s father did not seem racist and claimed he said : ‘ i 'm so incredibly ashamed of her			1
she 's a f * * * * * * idiot ’			0
the dad also said : ‘ she better know she 'll be paying for this ! ’ @entity111 wrote : ‘ based on the few mins chat , it seemed father made the decision to move to the @entity31			0
he believed this to be best for his family			0
‘ @entity7 's dad is like many @entity12 who fled the country post ' 94			1
he believed " the country would be a s * * * hole "			0
when @entity111 took a picture of @entity7 on his mobile phone her teenager brother shouted at him , but their father apparently stepped in and said : ‘ you should be apologizing to him ! what she did was unforgivable ! ’ @entity7 landed in @entity12 on @entity145 43 about 11.30pm friday and one can only imagine the number of angry responses she would have received once turning her cell phone on			1
joke 's on her : @entity7 's tweet inspired twitter users like this one to make a mock page dedicated to her racist comments you most certainly can : this tweet @entity7 wrote in january may have been a self fulfilling prophecy the hashtag ' # hasjustinelandedyet ' was trending on @entity1 around the world at the time as thousands awaited @entity7 's response			1
as @entity7 ’s tweet went viral on the internet she blasted for being ' outrageous ' and ' inappropriate ' , with titles like ' @entity165 ' stacking up against her			1
before confirming they had fired her - and with @entity7 still in mid-air - @entity44 released a statement condemning her behaviour as ' outrageous and offensive '			1
' this is an outrageous , offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of @entity44 , ’ said the statement			2
‘ unfortunately , the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight , but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action , ' a representative from @entity44 told the @entity181			1
@entity44 later announced she had been dismissed			2
in an ugly twist , @entity7 herself is now being subjected to racism herself on @entity1			1
amongst the many brutal tweets which were sent her way was one from a user calling themselves @entity189 who wrote : ‘ @entity191 ’			0
in - flight internet service provider @entity192 was also forced to backtrack after trying to cash in on the row			0
on its official @entity1 account @entity192 wrote : ‘ next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off , make sure you are getting on a @ @entity192 flight ! @entity198 ’ when users complained that such a comment was ‘ shameful ’ the company made things worse by saying to one user : ‘ with inflight connectivity the full story would have already been out there			2
’ only when @entity192 ’s first comment had been retweeted 1,000 times and branded ‘ weak and exploitative ’ did it change its mind			0
what a mess : @entity7 will have some explaining to do for her sloppy behavior on twitter the next @entity1 read : ‘ @ @entity214 , apologize for response to your @entity216 or wrong , it ’s not our policy to engage on these @entity220 clearly need a review			1
’ @entity7 ’s blunder led to scrutiny of not just her racist @entity1 , but tweets she had written @entity224 february 2012 she wrote : ' i had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night			1
' then about 12 hours before the racist @entity1 , she wrote : ' @entity229 : you 're in first class			2
get some deodorant ' - @entity235 monologue as i inhale @entity237			0
' however it was ' joke ' about @entity12 and @entity11 that caused the commotion			1
@entity1 user @entity243 wrote in response : ' wow ! reinforce the ignorant @entity31 stereotype much ? ' @entity247 tweeted : ' are you even real ? ! ? this is utterly ghastly on so many levels			2
' @entity251 wrote : ' listen , homegirl is about to be fired			0
' @entity253 stated that there is a possibility that the young pr executive 's account may have been hacked			0
however that is unlikely as her twitter profile has a number of other tweets that may also be deemed offensive			0
@entity7 wrote : ' i ca n't be fired for things i say while intoxicated right ? ' @entity7 also wrote : ' i like animals , but when it 's this cold out i 'll skin one myself for the fur ' and tweeted the comment directly at @entity270 , a famous animal rights organization			1
the @entity272 alum also tweeted : ' last day of hurricane season			0
ca n't wait for evacuations next year			0
' ironically enough , @entity272 is located in @entity275 , a city in which more than half of the population is black , according to @entity279			0
@entity275 also suffered tremendously after @entity280 decimated homes , took several lives , and wrecked the local economy			0
one @entity1 user took it so far as to create a fake profile for @entity7 named @entity286			1
her byline reads , ' pr disaster			0
' one of the mock tweets reads , ' i think the lady across the aisle is clicking at me			0
i 'm sorry ... i do n't speak @entity295 # whitesanta # longestflightever # haveilandedyet ' another mock tweet reads , ' @ @entity297 downing # @entity298 all flight in support of # @entity301 ! @entity302 sent me a @entity303 , but i sent it back ! ' @entity304 tried contacting @entity44 's media relations department , and since the contact listed on their website was @entity7 herself , no one was available for comment			1
on the @entity44 website her name has been removed and has been replaced with ' corporate communications			0
' the voice mail which previously gave out her personal cell phone number for media inquiries with a strict deadline , has also been changed			0
the reason @entity7 is traveling to @entity12 is still unknown , but chances are that @entity7 wo n't get the warmest @entity36 welcome			1
according to dosomething.org out of the 34 million people in the world who have @entity324 , 69 percent live in @entity325			0
there are around 23.8 million people in @entity12 with @entity11			1
@entity11 ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ) is caused by the @entity324 ( human immunodeficiency syndrome )			2
it can be transmitted via sexual intercourse , blood to blood contact , or childbirth			0
@entity324 greatly lowers the human immune system making it easier for those infected to carry fatal diseases .			0

@entity7 has been sacked following the furor her racist and insensitive @entity1 caused after it went viral
she caused a @entity1 revolt on friday after posting : ' going to @entity12 . hope i do n't get @entity11 . just kidding . i 'm white ! '
she has not yet issued an apology or explanation
@entity7 was the head pr representative of @entity44 , owned by @entity349 and responsible for websites like @entity46 , @entity351 , and @entity352 to name a few
@entity44 *slammed* their employee 's behavior as ' outrageous ' and said they would take ' appropriate action ' and have confirmed they ' parted ways with the employee in question '
in february 2012 @entity7 tweeted : ' i had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night . '
