a breakthrough in fertility science could lead to a huge boost in the success of @entity5 , scientists said today			1
@entity5 - or ‘ in vitro fertilisation ’ - is currently the only hope for many women to have a baby , and some 50,000 undergo the treatment every year in @entity11			2
but despite its popularity , the procedure has a poor success rate , with 75 per cent of @entity5 rounds failing to produce a baby			1
they have discovered a ‘ molecular switch ’ which stops an embryo being accepted in the mother ’s womb			1
if that switch can be blocked with drugs , it could potentially boost the number of babies born using @entity5 by up to 18,000 a year			1
about 37 per cent of @entity5 rounds are thought to fail because the embryo does not implant into the wall of the uterus			2
women who repeatedly suffer this failure have been shown to have high levels of a molecular switch which interferes in the communication between the embryo and the mother ’s womb			1
in laboratory tests , the researchers found that if they reduced levels of the molecule - called @entity45 - the embryo was less likely to be rejected			0
study leader professor @entity47 , whose work is published in the @entity49 , said : ‘ when an embryo is ready for implantation , its replacement is carefully timed to coincide with the window of maximal receptivity in the uterus			0
‘ this window is open for no more than four days			0
’ professor @entity47 ’s team found that a protein called @entity61 is required during the four - day window for the embryo to stick to the uterus			0
their tests suggest that the @entity45 molecular switch stops the crucial protein from growing in that window			2
scientists have discovered a ‘ molecular switch ’ which stops an embryo being accepted in the mother ’s womb			1
if that switch can be blocked with drugs , it could potentially boost the number of babies born using ivf by up to 18,000 a year dr @entity77 , a reproductive scientists who worked on the project , said the breakthrough could change the lives of childless women - although the team is a long way from turning it into a successful treatment			1
crucially , there are already chemicals on the market which have been shown to block @entity89 , and those could be developed to stop this molecular switch from interfering in the @entity5 process			1
‘ there are lots of ways in which we can inhibit micrornas in the lab , ’ she said			0
‘ eventually drugs might be developed that could improve implantation rates			0
’ professor @entity47 added : ‘ this is one of the hardest groups of women to treat in fertility science and rates are still very low across the board			0
‘ repeated ivf cycles are stressful and can be expensive too			0
‘ greater understanding of the mechanisms which control success or failure can lead directly to treatments to make @entity5 cycles more efficient so that infertile couples can start their families			2

@entity5 has a poor success rate , with 75 *%* of rounds failing to produce a baby
scientists have now discovered ' molecular switch ' involved in the process
this stops an embryo being accepted in the mother ’s womb , they say
if switch could be blocked with drugs , it could boost success of ivf
