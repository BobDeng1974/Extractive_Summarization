by @entity0 published : 19:13 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 19:14 est , 25 november 2013 shocking : for some young girls , sex is a currency - a new report has found girls are trading sex in return for favours , status or protection , according to a shocking official inquiry			1
many offer their bodies in exchange for ‘ goods ’ such as alcohol or drugs or to pay off a debt , researchers found			1
others do it to gain what they think is respect among peers by being associated with popular or powerful individuals			1
the survey of 500 people aged between 13 and 28 said the findings indicated a ‘ deep malaise within society ’			2
abuse is rarely reported by victims , some as young as 11 , because they believe it is normal behaviour , largely because of the desensitising effect of hardcore porn			1
young witnesses also fail to report offences because they blame victims for ‘ bringing harm on themselves ’ owing to the way they dress or their previous sexual history			1
child protection organisations were criticised for ‘ persistent failings that result in children falling through the net that is supposed to protect them ’			2
the details emerged in three reports from the @entity52			1
the reports were primarily involved with sexual exploitation in gangs and groups , where some perpetrators are just 12 years old			1
however , deputy commissioner @entity58 said the problems were ‘ more widespread ’			0
‘ our findings about the scale and nature of this form of sexual violence have left our panel members aghast , ’ she added			0
‘ we have found shocking and profoundly distressing evidence of sexual assault , including rape , being carried out by young people against other children and other young people			1
‘ while we have published chilling evidence of this violence in gang - associated contexts , we know too that it is more widespread			0
this is a deep malaise within society from which we must not shirk			0
’ in addition to the 500 surveyed in depth , others took part in interviews and child protection organisations , police forces and other groups were questioned			0
the currency in sex being used in playgrounds and the streets was most prevalent among gangs and groups of youths and the women who are in their sphere of influence			0
around 2,409 are known to have been abused in these circumstances and 16,500 were identified as being at risk			0
two - thirds of the young people who took part in the survey were aware of girls who had been pressurised or coerced into sexual activity			1
@entity104 said the victim had submitted in return for ‘ status or protection ’			0
this left them at risk from other gangs , however			0
one young person told researchers : ‘ she like used to sleep with just one gang ... and this other gang they seen her on the bus , dragged her off ... took her to someone ’s house or whatever , made her [ perform sex acts ]			0
’ findings : abuse is rarely reported by victims because they think it is normal behaviour due to the desensitising effect of pornography , the report claims ( posed by model ) two - fifths knew about rapes that had taken place and a third knew of instances where girls had been assaulted by more than one man			1
only one in 12 young victims would consider speaking to someone else about what had happened			1
if they did , it was generally a friend			0
one in 14 youths knew girls who had sex with several gang members to be accepted into their group			2
one said : ‘ she had sex with every boy in a gang just to be part of their gang			0
’ two in five gave examples of sex swapped for ‘ tangible goods ’ such as alcohol or drugs			1
some 46 per cent of young people thought victims ‘ deserved it ’ or ‘ asked for it ’			2
this was particularly true of young women who were sexually active with more than one person and were seen to have ‘ less right to withhold consent ’ – even though they were often pressured into having sex in the first place			0
miss @entity58 said victims were effectively invisible because child protection agencies did n’t believe what youngsters told them , failed to recognise ‘ patterns of exploitation ’ they were unfamiliar with and did n’t share information with police and other children ’s services			2
miss @entity58 said that the ‘ sheer levels of sadism ’ uncovered by the inquiry had been shocking			2
‘ in terms of the child - on - child , the peer - on - peer – whether in a gang - involved situation or not – it ’s the chilling inevitability of it that has been really deeply shocking			2
it ’s part of the warp and weft of those young people ’s lives			0
’ the reports come at the end of a two - year enquiry into child sex abuse			1
an earlier report , released last year , was criticised for failing to highlight the targeting of white girls by @entity202 men and other @entity203 .			1

girls offer their bodies in exchange for alcohol , drugs or to pay off debt
others do it to gain respect among peers , shocking report has found
abuse is rarely reported by victims as many believe it is ' normal behaviour '
