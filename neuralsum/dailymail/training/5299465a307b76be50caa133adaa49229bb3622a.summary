by @entity0 banks have threatened to charge for current accounts if they are broken up to create more competition banks have threatened to charge for current accounts if they are broken up to create more competition			1
and it is feared this would mean the poorest customers would be effectively dumped and left without an account			2
the @entity11 banks – @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 – have held a stranglehold over personal and small business customers for years			1
consumer advocates say their domination allows them to rip off account holders by charging higher prices for overdrafts and small business loans			0
they also argue that customers suffer from too little choice			2
plans to break up the banks are intended to introduce more competition and create a better deal for customers			1
the @entity32 , led by sir @entity33 , recommended the banks should be ring - fenced into retail divisions serving ordinary customers and ‘ casino ’ operations for @entity40 clients			1
he said if that does not work they should be broken up			0
labour leader @entity44 is expected tomorrow to unveil reforms which could cap a bank ’s market share to between 20 and 25 per cent , forcing them to offload branches to smaller rivals			0
it is thought mr @entity44 will also call for a @entity52 inquiry but his proposals for a market cap have been criticised by the conservatives and @entity57 governor @entity56			0
giving evidence to the @entity59 yesterday , mr @entity56 said : ‘ just breaking up an institution does n’t necessarily create or enable a more intensive competitive structure			2
’ a senior source at one of the biggest banks said yesterday the reforms would lead to banks either getting rid of their poorest and least profitable customers or charging them fees they can ill afford			1
the @entity32 , led by sir @entity33 , recommended the banks should be ring - fenced into retail divisions serving ordinary customers and ' casino ' operations for @entity40 clients he said they will also increase pressure on lenders to introduce fees for all current account holders			1
currently , four in five current accounts are free , while there are more than nine million basic bank accounts for poorer customers , who are only allowed to deposit and withdraw money , but can not have an overdraft			2
these free accounts cater for lower earners , the unemployed and those on benefits			0
one executive said : ‘ if you go down this route the people who will suffer will be the lowest earners			0
this would be a disaster for financial inclusion and mean many people will be left without current accounts			0
’ shadow treasury minister @entity100 hit back , saying : ‘ it ’s almost predictable that banks will stoop so low as to use these appalling scare tactics to preserve the status quo and avoid major reforms of the banking sector			1
’ but @entity108 mp @entity107 , a member of the @entity59 , said : ‘ these simplistic , interventionist ideas show the economic illiteracy of the @entity112 leadership			0
' it is inevitable that banks will become more selective about customers and many low earners could be frozen out of the market			1
