by @entity0 @entity1 who celebrated his first birthday yesterday , has undeniably earned himself the title of @entity5 cutie but it looks like the one - year - old may grow up to be a real @entity8			0
@entity11 graphic designer and illustrator , @entity9 has created an image of what young @entity1 might look like at the age of 18			1
the artist referred to the genetic traits that @entity1 has developed from his mother and father when using a computer to generate the final image			2
@entity9 , 30 , also referred back to images of the royal baby 's parents when they were younger in order to create an accurate prediction of his future appearance			2
she told the @entity38 : ' @entity1 has a very similar face to @entity40 ’s when he was a toddler			0
but , at the same time , his cheeks look a lot like baby @entity43 ’s and that ca n’t be ignored			0
especially as @entity43 has dimples , which are also a dominant trait , so it ’s very likely @entity1 will have them as well			0
' @entity9 referred back to images of @entity43 and @entity40 when predicting @entity1 's appearance at 18 according to @entity9 , @entity1 should expect to develop his mother 's dimples ( left ) but should avoid his father 's thinning hair ( right ) in order to make the final product the artist combined the current facial traits of both @entity1 's parents			1
' to create the remainder of the image , i merged @entity43 ’s hairline , ears and edge of mouth with @entity40 ’s nose , brows , forehead and lips			0
' although we can expect @entity1 to develop the same enviable dimples of his mother and face shapes of his father there are some attributes that the @entity1 can expect to avoid			1
@entity9 referred back to images of @entity43 ( left ) and @entity40 ( right ) when they were babies while creating the future - image of @entity1 @entity9 continued to say that she did n't believe that @entity1 would suffer from the same hair thinning that we have recently noticed on his father @entity40			2
' it looks likely that @entity1 wo n't go bald , as that trait is passed down on the mother 's side , and given her brother @entity88 and father @entity89 's full heads of hair , the little prince should also keep hold of his ! ' peas in a pod : @entity9 added that @entity1 has a very similar to face shape to what his father had as a toddler ( pictured )			1

@entity11 illustrator has created image of @entity1 as an adult
used images of his parents to create the final picture
@entity1 can expect to develop his mum 's dimples and dad 's face shape
