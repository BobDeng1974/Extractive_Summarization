detective constable @entity34 said : ' she denied everything in formal interviews , never showed any remorse and never admitted any wrong - doing			0
' she was in a position of trust at the hospital , working alongside other members of staff caring for vulnerable patients			1
' the assaults represented a loss of control and abuse of that trust			0
' @entity48 , mitigating , described @entity1 ’s actions as horseplay gone too far , saying they reflected a lack of training at the private hospital			2
he asked district judge @entity55 to show leniency on the basis that the assaults were without malice			1
judge @entity55 , sentencing @entity1 at @entity61 , repeatedly expressed astonishment that somebody with @entity1 ’s background was allowed to work with vulnerable people and questioned whether the hospital had been investigated as a result			1
describing the situation as ‘ disturbing ’ , he said : ' this young lady has a certain conviction and has ended up in a position of carer , working one to one with a group of teenagers with certain difficulties			0

' the term play fighting has been used and that is unbelievable , you went far too far and there was an element of humiliation			0
' following the events , the hospital was warned by the @entity100 for putting patients at significant risk ’ by failing to conduct risk assessments relating to the suitability of employees to work with vulnerable people			2
a spokesman from @entity16 said the decision to employ @entity1 was taken by previous owners @entity110			1
she said : ' the decision to employ this person and change her role was taken under the previous ownership of the hospital			0

it has robust procedures , including routine cctv recordings , in place to safeguard patients and staff alike			0
