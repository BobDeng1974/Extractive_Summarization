the most common time to have a heart attack or a stroke is 6.30am			0
now scientists think they have found out why this is – and it is all down to the body clock			0
researchers discovered that levels of a protein in people ’s blood that slows the breakdown of clots peaks at 6.30am			1
people are most likely to have a heart attack or a stroke at 6.30am because of a peak in a protein in the blood the team , from @entity21 , in @entity22 , and @entity23 , looked into why the number of heart attacks and strokes peak in the morning			1
they studied the protein levels in the bodies of 12 healthy adult volunteers for two weeks			0
the participants were assessed while their daily routines were desynchronised from their natural body clocks			0
the aim of this was to establish whether it is the natural body clock or the person ’s activities that causes protein levels to fluctuate			0
researchers specifically studied changes in the body ’s level of the protein plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( @entity44 - 1 ) , which inhibits the breakdown of blood clots			1
these are a major contributor to heart attack and some strokes			2
the research , published in the journal @entity52 , found a strict rhythm in body ’s level of @entity44 with a peak at about 6.30am			1
this protein slows the breakdown of blood clots meaning strokes and heart attacks are more likely study author dr @entity61 , director of the @entity62 at @entity21 , said : ‘ our findings suggest that the circadian system , or the internal body clock , contributes to the increased risk for cardiovascular events in the morning			1
’ his colleague and co-author , dr @entity69 , director of the @entity70 of @entity71 , added : ‘ our findings indicate that the human circadian system causes a morning peak in circulating levels of @entity44 , independent of any behavioural or environmental influences			1
‘ indeed , the circadian system determined to a large extent the @entity44 rhythm observed during a regular sleep / wake cycle			2
‘ this morning peak in @entity44 could help explain adverse cardiovascular events in vulnerable individuals			2
’ the researchers added that these studies established the circadian control of @entity44 in healthy individuals and that future research is required to test whether this rhythm is amplified , blunted or shifted in vulnerable individuals , such as those with obesity , diabetes , or cardiovascular disease .			0

the level of a specific protein in the blood peaks in the early morning
this protein - @entity44 - 1 - slows the breakdown of blood clots
so , when it is at its *highest* level , heart attacks and strokes are more likely
