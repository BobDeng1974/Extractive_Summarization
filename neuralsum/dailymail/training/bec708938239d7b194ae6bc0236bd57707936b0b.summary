congenital arthrogryposis is a rare condition that causes curved joints in several areas of the body at birth			1
contrary to popular belief , it is not a deformation of the joints themselves , but one of the tissue that surrounds them , thus fusing joints in place			2
it is caused by a number of factors , including lack of space in the uterus , muscle abnormalities , nerve abnormalities , blood circulation problems and maternal illness			0
the condition is present in about one in every 3,000 babies and is usually detected before birth			2
treatment options include physiotherapy , splinting and surgery			0
