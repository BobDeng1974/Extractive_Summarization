by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 14:04 est , 17 october 2013 a wandering cat is set to be reunited with his owner in @entity4 a year after he went missing - after being discovered 450 miles away from home , in a @entity7 bank			1
nine - year - old silver tabby @entity8 disappeared from @entity10 , south @entity4 , last october , with distraught owner @entity11 giving him up for dead but last week the cat strolled into a branch of @entity6 in @entity14 , @entity15 , after learning how to activate the automatic door			1
nine - year - old tabby @entity8 which was found in @entity14 , @entity7 , more than 400 miles from his home in @entity4			1
the curious cat is pictured with @entity21 , 14 , who is looking after him in @entity23 miles : nine - year - old silver tabby @entity8 disappeared from @entity10 , south @entity4 , last october and was found in @entity14 , @entity15 shocked staff only noticed their new guest after he settled down for a nap on an armchair			1
workers handed him in to the @entity31 charity , and when he was checked for a microchip it revealed he was 449 miles from home			0
his owner ’s mother @entity34 said she could not believe her ears when she took the call - though she admitted that @entity8 - nicknamed @entity38 after a children 's book - has always been a ' character '			1
before he made his road trip , @entity8 was well known in @entity10 , where dogs crossed the street to avoid him and he would force motorists to drive round him by sitting in the road			1
just like the children ’s book character @entity38 , he also had several houses he visited to be fed. he was known by different names including @entity51 and @entity52 , and he had his own chair in the home of an elderly neighbour			2
office manager ms @entity34 , 59 , said : ' none of us can believe it			0
i ca n’t get over it			0
' @entity8 has always been a @entity38 , but he has surpassed @entity38 this time			1
' i was just thinking on thursday that it must be a year since he was last seen			2
on friday afternoon i had a call from a vet in @entity14 saying he had just been handed in			2
' how on earth had he got over 400 miles from @entity65 and where has he been for the last year ? ' staff at @entity31 are now planning to arrange for @entity8 to be flown back to @entity4 to be reunited with @entity34 and daughter @entity67			1
@entity8 joined the family eight years ago , when he used to go to their home and be fed before disappearing again			2
eventually ms @entity11 , 33 , an art teacher and mother - of - two , decided to give him a permanent home and had him neutered and microchipped , but he did not curb his wandering ways			2
the nine - year - old silver tabby turned up in @entity14 this week , more than 400 miles and a year after he went missing from his home in @entity4 the travelling tom disappeared from his home in @entity65 last october and has been missing so long his owners thought he was dead she added : ' he was always a character and a @entity81 , for those who know the children ’s story			1
' he used to sit in the middle of her road and cars would go round him , he hated dogs so they would cross the road to avoid him and he had several names - @entity52 , @entity51 and apparently someone thought @entity51 was pregnant			2
' he also used to hang around the old people ’s home in her street and had his own chair in the home of an elderly neighbour			0
' @entity8 ’s disappearances became more frequent after ms @entity11 ’s son @entity101 was born three years ago , and last october he vanished altogether			1
the family searched all his usual haunts before giving up , convinced he was dead			0
luckily @entity104 , who works at the @entity106 surgery in @entity14 , had been asked to give @entity8 the once - over and check him for a microchip after he had been handed to @entity31			1
the tabby had learned how to operate the door of the nearby @entity6 , and had been going inside to sleep on the chairs left out for customers			1
she said : ' he had been staying in the bank , as he had learned how to open the doors and was going in and lying on the chairs			0
' they brought him in and i scanned him			0
at first when i saw the phone number and address i thought maybe they had moved up but when i got in contact with the owners they were still in @entity4			1
but last week the cat strolled into a branch of @entity6 in @entity14 , @entity15 , after learning how to activate the automatic door ' they thought he was dead			1
they had not seen him for a year			0
' she was absolutely in shock			0
i phoned and said do you have a silver tabby called @entity8 , and i told her that we had got him			1
' she asked where we were , and i heard her shouting her husband and saying " they ’ve found @entity8 and he ’s in @entity7 "			2
' he must have jumped in a van or a lorry			0
' he was in pretty good condition			0
i think somebody had been looking after him			0
he is really nice and friendly			0
' staff at @entity31 are now trying to arrange to fly @entity8 back home , but they still have no idea how he made it all the way to @entity15			1
the most likely theory is that he hopped into a lorry or removal van which was travelling north			0
but the most pressing problem now facing @entity8 ’s owners is how to keep tabs on him once he is back in his old neighbourhood			1
ms @entity34 added : ' if @entity67 was driving home and saw him up the road she would stop the car and he would jump in			0
he must have done something like that			0
' we ’re absolutely overjoyed to be getting him back , but it ’s going to be hard keeping him in			0
' there is another @entity81 book about @entity38 going to the @entity167			0
i think @entity8 must have read them			2
