@entity0 admits he feared for his own future and @entity3 ’s season after he rowed with supporters ahead of their 4 - 0 humiliation at @entity6 , labelling the day ‘ one of the darkest of my life ’			1
this evening , caretaker boss @entity0 and his players will be bidding for revenge against a @entity6 side who played their part in one of the worst days in @entity3 ’ s recent history			1
@entity0 , then assistant to @entity19 , got involved in an expletive - laden altercation with fans before the game when he objected to a ‘ @entity25 ’ banner in the away end			1
@entity3 caretaker manager @entity0 regrets his involvement in a row with supporters in september @entity0 ( second left ) argued with fans before @entity3 were beaten 4 - 0 by @entity6 @entity3 fans hold a banner revealing their frustration at former manager @entity19 during that game what followed on the pitch was a comprehensive drubbing to leave the @entity37 bottom of the @entity38 as the @entity3 turned on the team and their manager			1
and @entity0 – who was a teenage player at @entity41 before returning as a coach in 1992 - says that september afternoon ranks as the lowest of his time at the club			1
‘ it was absolutely the worst day of my time here – it was one of the darkest days of my life to be honest , ’ he said			2
‘ i was embarrassed to be part of @entity3 coaching staff			1
i feared the worst for the season that night			1
it stayed with me for a long time			2
‘ yes , we played against a good team but we created nothing on the day and they could have won it by six or seven , and that 's not right			2
i 'll be telling the guys at the team meeting that we 've got a point to prove			0
’ @entity0 later issued an apology for the clash with fans , as did goalkeeping coach @entity63 , who got involved in a @entity64 row with another supporter			1
and @entity0 reflected : ‘ it started badly even before kick - off			1
i have to go on record to say i did n't have a problem with the fans protesting , but when @entity71 said to me he was a bit disappointed with the banners being raised before kick - off , that was the only thing that upset me			0
@entity76 ( centre ) scored twice for @entity6 against @entity3 and @entity0 will need to stop him former @entity79 manager @entity78 has been linked with the permanent manager 's vacancy at @entity3 ‘ people who know me know that i 'm never going to walk away from a situation like that			1
i was trying to do the best for the team and all i was saying was telling them not to put the banners up there and then			0
then he came back at me a couple of times and unfortunately i reacted the wrong way			0
‘ you know what i 'm like , i 'm not a shrinking violet , am i ? i apologised afterwards , absolutely , and rightly so , but there was n't one that came the other way			0
’ @entity0 , though , says he was concerned about the reaction towards him in the following game at home to @entity102			2
‘ i do care and i 'd realised i made a mistake , ’ said @entity0 , who celebrated his 50th birthday yesterday			2
‘ i realised how bad we 'd been during the game			0
the fans were right to be unhappy with the way we 'd played			0
i made that situation even worse and going into the @entity102 game straight after , i did feel uncomfortable for the first time ever when we were doing the warm - up			0
‘ i was n't quite sure of the reaction i 'd get from people but i have to say it was very good			0
that surprised me a bit to be honest			0
‘ then we went on a winning run and the reaction from the fans was brilliant , that helped and made us stronger			0
’ @entity0 could remain at the helm at @entity3 until the summer , when @entity78 could take the job @entity0 , meanwhile , will sit down with managing director @entity123 after today 's game to discuss the club 's search for a new head coach			1
the squad fly to @entity129 tomorrow for a four - day break and do not play again until the trip to @entity102 on january 31			0
it is expected that an announcement will be made before the end of the month , with former @entity79 boss @entity78 the favourite to be installed			2
he , though , would prefer to wait until the summer and there is a strong possibility that @entity0 will be put in charge until may .			1

@entity0 argued with @entity3 supporters before *emphatic* defeat
he admitted he regrets the *incident* and feared for his future at the club
@entity0 could remain in charge of @entity3 until the end of the season
