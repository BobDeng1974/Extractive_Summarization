@entity1 ’s missing fans will need a little more convincing before they start queuing around the block for season tickets despite an impressive late cameo from teenager @entity5			1
@entity7 ’s men showed enough huff and puff against @entity10 on their first appearance at @entity12 this pre-season but rarely looked like breaking down the disciplined @entity14 until injury time when @entity16 hit the crossbar			1
it has been a frustrating build - up to the campaign for @entity1 who had lost two of their previous three friendlies against @entity24 and @entity25			1
new beginnings : @entity27 is working alongside @entity7 as the club 's new assistant manager mr reliable : @entity31 was @entity1 's stand - out player last season with a series of outstanding displays on the move : @entity36 will be looking to build on an encouraging season last term there were encouraging displays from youngster @entity41 , and @entity43 and @entity44 who hardly got a kick for @entity1 last season due to injury and loan spells			1
but with @entity50 still on the treatment table , a lack of firepower will worry @entity7 and his assistant @entity27			2
season ticket sales are substantially down from last season ’s figure of 28,000 and @entity56 may want to see how the team perform in their first @entity59 game at @entity60 next weekend before deciding whether to commit for the campaign			1
@entity1 ’s first home game in the league is against @entity64 on august 23			2
@entity10 ’s best - known player to @entity67 fans was @entity68 , who used to play for @entity69 and was part of @entity73 ’s @entity72 squad in @entity74 this summer			2
the visitors certainly gave a decent demonstration of the @entity14 art of defending and @entity1 were restricted to half - chances for @entity79 and @entity36 in a poor opening 45 minutes			1
@entity1 tried to introduce more zip in the second period			2
@entity79 was foiled by goalkeeper @entity83 and @entity84 had an effort land on the roof of the net			0
forgotten man : @entity44 may yet turn his @entity1 career around under @entity7 back on track ? @entity16 and @entity90 could become key players for @entity1 this season the arrival of substitute bent after 64 minutes reminded @entity1 fans they do have a proven goalscorer on their books but the question is whether he still remains potent at the age of 30			1
at the other end of the age scale , 18 - year - old @entity5 showed promise of a brighter future for the long - suffering @entity103 and @entity104			0
one strong run after 75 minutes had the @entity10 defence backtracking			0
perhaps the youngster should have taken a shot but he unselfishly laid a pass off to fellow substitute @entity110 , who took a heavy first touch to waste the opening			0
encouraged , @entity16 made a sharp into the penalty area but captain @entity114 placed his cross too close to the defence and the ball never arrived			0
@entity118 showed ambition with a late long - range shot then @entity16 hit the crossbar from a pull - back by @entity41			0
it was close , but not close enough			0
@entity1 must hope that is not going to be the story of their season			1
elsewhere , @entity127 came on as a late substitute for the home side as he made his first appearance since the @entity72 .			0

@entity1 could only manage a *goalless* draw against @entity10
it has been a *disappointing* pre-season for @entity7 's side
they travel to @entity60 on the opening *day* of the new season next satur*day*
