@entity1 aviation regulators loosened restrictions on the commercial use of drones on thursday , granting six television and movie production companies permission to use the small , remotely piloted aircraft to shoot scenes on closed sets			1
the @entity10 said it would allow filming with drones provided the aircraft weigh 55 pounds ( 25 kg ) or less , are used within sight of the remote pilot , who must hold a private pilot 's license , and are flown under 400 feet ( 120 meters ) in altitude , among other restrictions			1
the approval marks a major advance for the growing drone industry , which is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity once restrictions on commercial use of drones are removed			1
the @entity10 currently bans most commercial drone flights , but is required by @entity24 to integrate drones into the @entity1 airspace in coming years			1
ready for takeoff : the @entity10 said it would allow filming with drones provided the aircraft weigh 55 pounds ( 25 kg ) or less , are used within sight of the remote pilot , who must hold a private pilot 's license , and are flown under 400 feet ( 120 meters ) in altitude , among other restrictions ' this is the first step to allowing the film and television industry to use unmanned aircraft systems in our nation 's airspace , and it 's a milestone in the wider effort to allow unmanned aircraft for many different types of commercial use , ' transportation secretary @entity33 said in a conference call			1
the six companies that received @entity10 exemptions from the drone ban are @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity56 dba @entity54 , and @entity57 , @entity58 the @entity10 said it has asked for additional information from @entity60 , a seventh aerial video company that filed for exemptions with this group in june			1
the agency said it is working closely with the company to obtain the information			0
in granting the exemptions , the @entity10 barred the six companies from making drone flights at night , required that flights take place on sets closed to the public , and said operators must inspect the aircraft before each flight			1
the approval marks a major advance for the growing drone industry , which is expected to generate billions of dollars in economic activity once restrictions on commercial use of drones are removed the film and television industry hailed the @entity10 decision			1
' today 's announcement is a great victory for the industry but also a great victory for audiences , ' @entity84 , chairman and chief executive officer of the @entity86 , said on the conference call			0
@entity84 noted that drones have been used in other countries to film scenes in such movies as the @entity98 film ' @entity99 ' and the ' @entity101 ' series			0
' this is going to bring a lot of business back home to the @entity1 , ' he said			2
the drone industry has mushroomed in recent years with the arrival of small , inexpensive remote - control aircraft that can carry cameras , sensors or other equipment that makes them useful for a wide range of uses , from inspecting oil pipelines to crop dusting to locating people lost in the wilderness			2
the drone industry would create at least 70,000 @entity1 jobs in the first three years after the aircraft are integrated into @entity1 airspace , and generate nearly $ 14 billion in economic activity , according to the @entity122 , a trade group			2
the @entity10 's approval shows the agency working relatively quickly to approve new uses , since the petitions for exemptions were filed in may and june			2
under law , the agency had to respond to the requests in 120 days , said attorney @entity131 , of counsel at @entity133 , who filed the exemption requests to the @entity10			2
' it 's for the six specific companies on closed - set filming , ' said @entity131			0
' it 's restrictive and regulatory in nature			0
but it 's a welcome first step			0
' the exemptions come as the @entity10 is still drafting proposed rules for integrating commercial drones into the national airspace the exemptions come as the @entity10 is still drafting proposed rules for integrating commercial drones into the national airspace			1
a draft set of those rules is circulating in @entity150 , according to industry sources , but the @entity10 is widely expected to miss a deadline of publishing the draft rules this year			0
final approval is expected to be years away , which means exemptions like those granted on thursday are the only way businesses can legally get permission to use them			0
last year , the @entity1 government created six sites for testing broader commercial uses , in @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170			1
among the potential uses : @entity172 has said it is developing airborne drones capable of flying on their own and delivering anything from candy to medicine			0
@entity178 announced plans last year to use drones to make home deliveries .			0

the @entity10 will let the production companies fly small drones on closed sets in the @entity1
@entity187 will soon have a new angle on capturing aerial *footage*
@entity10 has approved exemptions that would for the first time allow six aerial *photo* and video production companies to use the devices
