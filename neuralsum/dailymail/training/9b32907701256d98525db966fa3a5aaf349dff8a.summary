already it has become the defining image of the title race : the slip , the desperate scramble to get upright and the despairing chase as @entity6 closes in on goal to score for @entity8			0
it encapsulated everything that has made the @entity11 a compelling global spectacle			0
there was genuine pathos in seeing a player of @entity17 ’s stature close to a title that no one had ever imagined him winning , only to see it fall away in the final games of the season , in part as a result of his own mistake			1
it was almost irrelevant that title races are not decided in single moments , that a combination of events over nine months determines the outcome and that , in that @entity8 match , there was still time for @entity35 to recover			0
such rationality is obscured by the power of a 10 - second video clip that seemingly changed @entity17 ’s destiny			1
‘ we were top of the @entity11			0
but that ’s football , that ’s life			0
i ca n’t feel sorry for myself			2
’ and for @entity17 the words have to be meaningful rather than a mantra he repeats to comfort himself			1
he is sat in the @entity61 resort on the @entity62 in @entity63 , here on @entity66 duty , and he is the captain of a young , inexperienced squad who are about to travel to @entity69 to play in the @entity71 finals			1
football challenges do not come much greater and for @entity17 there is no time for introspection			1
not that he is one to dwell on failures			0
he has managed to avoid viewing a repeat of his error			0
‘ i have n’t seen it			2
when you slip … is there anybody who has n’t slipped at any time in their life ? the difference is i did it at a bad time and at a bad place , at a bad moment			2
‘ if i ’d done a bad backpass , scored an own goal , or done my job wrong it would have really beaten me up for a long time			1
i keep saying to myself , how , where and why ? there are no answers because it was a slip			0
‘ if i had made that mistake when i was younger — for example when i scored that own goal against @entity8 ( in the 2005 league cup final ) when i was around 23			0
that killed me for a long time			0
’ he recalls : ‘ you are not experienced enough to know that you can make up for it with time , that the memory will fade away			2
i put myself under an awful lot more pressure then			0
that ’s not to say i wo n’t put the same pressure on myself to make up for this one , but i ’ve learned to cope better with setbacks through age			1
‘ i do n’t like making mistakes , big mistakes at important times			2
i ’ve made more than a few through my career but as a player with experience you learn to deal with them that little bit better the older you get			2
yes , it hurt a lot — not just the slip , more letting the title slip towards the end because we ’d come so close and had a terrific season			1
‘ i was disappointed for all the lads , for all the supporters and everyone at the club , that we could n’t hang on and do it			2
it would have been a monumental achievement to go from seventh to first			0
but with experience you tend to look back at the positives as well as the negatives			0
to finish second in the hardest league in the world , to have the season i ’ve had personally , to watch the likes of @entity137 grow and to see the team do so well , was fantastic			0
’ his response is unsurprising			0
the end of the season must have been a crushing disappointment but he is 34 next week and old enough to maintain perspective			2
he is married to @entity143 , has three young daughters and they are quick to focus his mind on other matters			2
breakthrough : @entity8 striker @entity6 runs on to score the opening goal in 2 - 0 win against @entity35 ‘ they do n’t get involved with the football , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ @entity143 is clueless when it comes to football and none of my girls are interested so i had to deal with it myself			0
i do n’t want anyone around this table thinking i ’m a young , naive , insecure person who goes home and cries in his bedroom			1
' i ’m 33 years of age with 100 or so caps and 600 - odd appearances			1
i ’m big enough and brave enough to take it on the chin			0
i take responsibility for the slip and the damage it ’s done			0
but i ’ll prove to everybody in this @entity71 that i ’m fit , fresh and ready to perform			1
’ those reflections also reveal a trace of the thoughts of @entity175 , the renowned psychiatrist with whom @entity17 works and who is accompanying the @entity66 squad to @entity69			1
@entity17 once would have been marked down as a worrier ; certainly former @entity66 manager @entity179 thought so			1
that does not seem to be the case today			0
‘ i ’ve spoken to @entity175 about it , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ i talk to him about the good things and bad things i do in every single game and every training session			0
it ’s not just about the one case that i might dwell on for a long time			0
having @entity175 there is a bit of a help in dealing with it			0
’ clearly , with the @entity71 upon us , there are more pressing matters , for which @entity17 is grateful			1
disappointment : @entity17 shows his dejection after his slip led to the first goal ‘ otherwise i would be sitting on a sun lounger wondering about to the last three or four games of the season , keeping going over and over where it ’s gone wrong , asking myself why and where , driving myself potty			1
i ’ve got to park the slip at the back of my mind and forget about it because i ’ve got a huge tournament coming up			2
‘ once you start playing and training , different things come up to think about			0
for example , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217			0
those are the things on my mind			0
‘ i ’ve got to make sure for everyone ’s sake that i park the memory — i ca n’t change it			1
i ’ve got to try to perform as well as i can for everyone			0
’ indeed , the vibrancy and youth of this @entity66 squad may prove to be the best antidote to @entity17 ’s disappointments			1
‘ there is lots of energy in the camp , thank @entity234 , ’ added @entity17 , as he gestures to @entity137 , 19 , sitting nearby			1
‘ i have n’t told him yet but he ’ll be doing all my running ! ‘ there are plenty of legs , plenty of energy , plenty of excitement in the squad but it ’s also mixed with a couple of older , more experienced lads who have been around the block , and they will support them and take all the pressure off them			1
taking a break : @entity17 and @entity252 enjoy a breather during @entity66 's @entity71 preparations in @entity63 ‘ they ’ve got no worrying to be doing or any pressure at all from us			1
we want them to go out with no fear , to do as much damage as they can			0
they ’re certainly capable of it			0
‘ i ’m excited to be here surrounded by a lot of young talent			2
like me , i ’m sure you ’re all wondering how it ’s going to go and can they produce the form they ’ve produced with their clubs for @entity66 ? ‘ @entity272 will tell and we ’ll have to wait and see			1
but i ’ve got confidence and belief in these youngsters			0
‘ they ’ve shown for @entity35 in some really big games , against big opponents , that they have no fear and are capable of causing all sorts of problems			0
and i think that will be the case over in @entity69			1
’ for @entity17 , of course , it could be a last appearance on the world stage for his country			1
international retirement looms at the end of this tournament , although manager @entity291 will undoubtedly attempt to talk him out of it			1
@entity17 will make a decision at the end of the tournament			1
a good @entity71 and the promise of youth might persuade him to play on			1
final glory : it could be @entity17 's last appearance on the world stage for @entity66 with an eye to the future he adds : ‘ i ’m not going to leave anyone hanging			1
do n’t worry : as soon as the @entity71 is over i ’ll sit down with the manager and i ’ll make the decision			1
i have n’t made that decision because i have n’t had the chance to chat with the manager at length over it			1
‘ but i ’ll be chatting to ( @entity35 manager ) @entity311 , @entity291 and a few important people around me , whose opinion i respect , players i ’ve played with			0
‘ i ’ll chat to them all and make the right decision at the right time			1
it will be very close after the @entity71			2
it does depend on how the @entity71 goes , how i perform , how the team perform			2
am i still going to be wanted after the @entity71 ? these are all the questions we ’ll have to sit down and answer			2
‘ i wo n’t stay around if i ’m not wanted			2
i hope i perform to the level where i ’m wanted and i ’ve got that difficult decision to make			2
’ after all , next season @entity35 will play in the @entity323 , an additional if welcome burden			0
‘ that will be a factor , ’ says @entity17 earnestly , before smiling			2
‘ but we have to wait and see whether i ’m selected to play in those @entity323 games			0
’ a new generation is knocking on the door , impatient to arrive			0
but @entity66 and @entity35 will want to call on @entity17 for a year or two yet .			1

@entity17 : if i was n’t going to @entity69 i ’d be sitting on a sun lounger and driving myself potty over what went wrong
@entity17 is captain of a young , inexperienced squad who are about to travel to @entity69 for @entity71 finals
the 33 - year - old will make a decision on his @entity66 career at the end of the tournament
