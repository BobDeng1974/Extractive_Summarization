film critic @entity0 has dismissed sunday night 's @entity2 ceremony as ' little better than a crapshoot ' , and claimed @entity5 judges let their maids vote for them			0
several @entity8 names , including @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , are in the running for sunday 's @entity2			1
but the veteran broadcaster , who presented the @entity18 's @entity17 programme for 26 years , said the voting system is unfair - and that being nominated is just as worthy as taking home the famous statuette			1
' apart from best picture , for which everyone votes , all the nominees are chosen by their peers - actors by other actors , directors by other directors and so on			2
' if people who were probably vying with you for the same job think you did some of the best work of the year , that 's a true compliment			2
' @entity8 actor @entity9 has been hotly tipped to take home an @entity2 for his portrayal of @entity51 in @entity52 another brit , @entity10 has been nominated for his role in @entity55 , where he played codebreaker @entity56 @entity0 predicted that @entity26 actor @entity24 was more likely than @entity58 to scoop the best actor @entity2 , simply because the 63 - year - old is ' a local boy ... who has never won a major award '			1
' just being nominated for an @entity2 is a victory in itself , ' he said			0
' it 's only when it comes to picking the winners that everyone votes in every category and the whole thing becomes little better than a crapshoot			0
' @entity8 actress @entity12 is also in the running for @entity72 , thanks to her role opposite @entity75 in @entity76 ( pictured ) both @entity11 and @entity9 have been nominated for their parts in @entity52 , which has also been nominated for @entity80 both @entity13 and @entity10 have been nominated for @entity55 and @entity0 questioned whether members of the @entity82 entitled to vote for the prestigious awards have even seen all of the films vying for the prizes			1
' personal likes and dislikes come into play			0
you might vote for someone simply because he or she was nice to you on the set , ' he said			0
' then there 's the question of whether all the voters actually saw all the films			2
it 's not unknown for some , especially the elderly , to get their maids to watch them on dvd and deliver their opinions			0
' @entity102 , in which @entity103 plays @entity106 @entity105 , is also among those nominated for @entity80 the @entity108 is also up for the biggest prize on @entity2 night , with the 87th @entity2 ceremony taking place on sunday @entity112 - a biopic of @entity114 - is among the @entity80 nominations coming of age @entity117 , which was filmed over the course of 12 years could win @entity80 whiplash has also been nominated for the major prize , while @entity121 ( left ) is in the running for best supporting actor @entity80 @entity102 birdman boyhood the @entity108 the @entity126 @entity112 the @entity127 whiplash best director @entity130 , @entity26 @entity131 , @entity132 @entity133 , @entity134 @entity135 , @entity108 @entity136 , @entity55 best actor @entity138 , @entity134 @entity103 , @entity139 sniper @entity10 , @entity55 @entity24 , @entity26 @entity9 , @entity52 best actress @entity141 , two days one night @entity11 , @entity52 @entity142 , @entity143 @entity12 , @entity76 @entity144 , @entity145 best supporting actor @entity147 , @entity148 @entity149 , @entity132 @entity150 , @entity26 @entity151 , @entity134 @entity121 , @entity152 best supporting actress @entity154 , @entity132 @entity155 , @entity145 @entity13 , @entity55 @entity156 , @entity26 @entity157 , @entity158 @entity159 birdman – @entity161 the @entity108 – @entity162 @entity163 – @entity164 & @entity165 mr. @entity166 – @entity167 unbroken – @entity168 @entity17 @entity163 @entity169 @entity170 @entity171 @entity172 @entity173 @entity102 the @entity126 inherent vice the @entity127 whiplash @entity176 birdman boyhood @entity134 the @entity108 @entity179 @entity180 @entity134 the @entity108 @entity181 @entity182 the @entity108 the @entity126 interstellar mr. @entity166 the @entity127 @entity184 “ @entity185 , ” @entity186 “ everything is awesome , ” the @entity187 “ glory , ” @entity112 “ @entity190 , ” beyond the @entity191 “ i ’m not gon na @entity193 , ” @entity192 … i ’ll be me best @entity195 @entity196 the @entity197 @entity198 @entity199 the tale of princess @entity201 @entity202 — short crisis hotline : @entity204 1 @entity205 our curse the @entity208 @entity209 @entity210 @entity102 boyhood the @entity108 the @entity126 whiplash @entity213 the @entity108 the @entity126 interstellar @entity158 mr. @entity166 @entity215 the bigger picture the @entity217 feast me and my @entity220 a single life @entity222 @entity223 @entity224 and @entity225 @entity226 @entity227 the phone call @entity229 @entity102 birdman the @entity231 : @entity232 interstellar unbroken @entity234 @entity102 birdman interstellar unbroken whiplash best visual effects @entity239 : the winter soldier @entity241 @entity181 interstellar x-men : @entity243 @entity202 — feature @entity245 finding @entity246 last days of @entity247 the @entity248 @entity249 @entity250 the @entity108 inherent vice @entity158 @entity252 mr. @entity166			1
