the temporary installation of new outdoor urinals along a party street has been met with revolt			1
for more than 10 years , @entity4 has been trying to manage public urination in @entity7 's busy nightclub strip and hope these portable toilets will be the answer			1
the loos are aimed at longtime perpetrators - believed to be drunken men - who have been relieving themselves in front of businesses and alleyways , one councillor told @entity17			1
but when two blocks of portable urinals were put up on friday night , locals were ' disgusted ' and ' offended ' by what they could see			1
three blocks of portable urinals were put up in @entity7 on friday night as part of a one week trial by @entity4 @entity26 says they are trying to find ways to deter drunken men from urinating in front of shops and alleyways councillor @entity31 says public urination along @entity33 and @entity34 in @entity7 , southeastern @entity35 , has been an issue for 10 to 12 years			1
' we 've had drunk people urinating in shop fronts , on windows and all over footpaths for a long time now , ' he told @entity17			2
' i do n't like the urinals either but they 're are less offensive than the alternative			2
' these urinals are just a way for us to manage the problem as council simply does n't have the power to arrest people who urinate in public			2
' to deter drunken men from having a tinkle in inappropriate places , council put up two blocks of portable loos on friday night			1
the podiums are designed so up to three men are able to use them at the same time			2

' @entity72 says many are also concerned about the design of the loos			0
' they have modesty panels but i do n't think they 're big enough so tomorrow we 're installing bigger shields which will approach the full body length , ' he said			0
' the urinals will only be operating between midnight and dawn so during other times they will be locked so people ca n't use them			1
' the toilets are on a one week trial and will be reviewed by council after december 26			0
@entity72 says it 's too early to judge whether the urinals have been successful			0
' it 's a seasonal issue for us , obviously becoming worse during this time of year , ' he said			0
' so @entity95 will be the big test			0

@entity4 put up temporary outdoor urinals along its busy party street
the council hope this would stop drunken men from urinating in front of shops and alleyways
but locals say it is ' offensive ' to see men relieving themselves in the portable loos
each podium has three urinals and has a *plastic* panel which covers just the backside of users
they will only be open from midnight to dawn
