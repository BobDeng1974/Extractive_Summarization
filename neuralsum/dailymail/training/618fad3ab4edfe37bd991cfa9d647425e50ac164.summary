an @entity1 probe launched eight years ago to explore @entity2 has awoken from hibernation in deep space as it nears the dwarf planet and its moons			1
@entity7 came out of hibernation this evening and has transmitted a message back to mission control on @entity10 showing that all of its systems are fully working			1
@entity14 , a physicist from @entity15 , said : ' @entity7 is healthy and cruising quietly through deep space , nearly three billion miles from home , but its rest is over			0
' the @entity7 probe has successfully awoke from its last period of hibernation 3billion miles from @entity10 as it prepares to make the first detailed observations of @entity2 and its atmosphere ( artist 's impression ) the craft is currently three billion miles from this planet meaning radio messages beamed back take nearly four and a half hours to arrive			1
@entity7 was launched in january 2006 and drifted through space in hibernation for 1,873 days , about two thirds of its journey , while it travelled to the edge of our solar system			0
during its trip , @entity37 engineers briefly woke the craft every few months to check if its systems were still functioning			0
the craft 's computer has also been sending a weekly message to @entity10 , making 267 messages since it launched			0
during its journey , @entity7 passed three to four times closer to @entity47 than the previous probe , using the planet 's gravity to increase its speed and reduce journey times to @entity2 by three years			1
while the probe has now awoken from its last hibernation phase , it will still take seven months to reach its closet point from @entity2 , passing within 7,767miles of the planet 's surface in july 2015			1
as it flies past , it will beam images of @entity2 and its largest moon @entity59 back to @entity10 , which will be the most detailed pictures ever taken of the bodies			1
while there it will also examine several small , icy bodies in the @entity65 , the most densely populated part of our solar system which begins around 2.5billion miles from @entity10			2
as @entity2 has an elliptical , or oval - shaped orbit , it strays into this region on its 247.7 - year orbit around the sun. the object there are leftover debris from the birth of our solar system 4.6billion years ago			2
scientists have identified three possible objects that @entity7 could collect data from , which sit about 1.5billion miles further on from @entity2			1
@entity7 begins its exploration of @entity2 in january at a distance of about 160million miles			2
this image of @entity47 and its moon @entity84 was taken by @entity7 as it passed close to the planet in 2007 , using its gravitational field to boost its speed and reduce the journey time to @entity2 by three years during its mission , @entity7 will collect data on @entity2 and @entity59 's surfaces , giving astronomers an up - close look at the dim surfaces that are difficult to see from @entity10			1
the craft carries onboard seven instruments including infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers - which measure uv and infra - red waves , a multicolor camera , a high - resolution telescopic camera and a space dust detector			0
all of the instruments aboard @entity7 draw power from a radioisotope thermoelectric generator - a type of nuclear motor - which provides less power than a pair of 100 - watt light bulbs			0
@entity2 is about 2,300 kilometers in diameter , smaller than @entity10 's moon , and has a mass about 500 times less than @entity10			2
in 2006 , the @entity115 withdrew @entity2 's status as a planet , reclassifying it as a dwarf planet and leaving the solar system with eight planets			1
the news that @entity7 has successfully awoken is just the latest development in what has been an exciting few weeks for space travel			0
on november 12 the @entity125 made a momentous achievement in the history of space travel by successfully landing the first space probe , @entity130 , on a comet			0
though the probe 's harpoons failed to launch , meaning it ultimately landed in a cave with its main solar panels blocked , it managed to use all of its instruments before running out of battery			0
and two days ago @entity37 launched the first test flight of its @entity140 space - craft , hailed as the start of the @entity143 - era , it has the potential to carry astronauts to an asteroid and the red planet .			0

@entity7 probe has woken from hibernation 3billion miles from @entity10
signal saying all systems working took four hours to reach mission control
observing @entity2 before passing close to dwarf planet in july next year
it will then take the most detailed pictures of its surface ever seen
will then observe objects in @entity65 - another 1.5billion miles away
