by @entity1 reporter published : 22:15 est , 17 july 2012 updated : 22:15 est , 17 july 2012 giant tv screens have helped to bring families back together in the living room , new research suggests			1
@entity7 's @entity6 found that despite competing challenges for recreational time , the time people spent watching television has actually gone up			1
@entity13 viewers spent an average of four hours each day watching tv in 2011 , up from 3.6 hours in 2002			1
meanwhile , in the first quarter of this year , more than 35 per cent of tv sets sold were at least 33in in size			0
happy family : big televisions are luring the children back to the living room , a new report by media regulator @entity7 suggests @entity25 , @entity7 's director of research , said larger and flatter tv screens appeared to be bringing children back into the living room , reversing a trend which saw them watching a separate set in their bedroom			1
' television viewing has been robust between 2002 and 2011 , ' he said			1
' what 's interesting here is that with all these new technologies being adopted by 16 to 24 - year - olds and to some extent children , we 're not seeing tv viewing among those age groups falling			1
' it 's always been lower than average for the younger age groups because they have different lifestyles and less time at home			1
but we 're not seeing a major impact on tv viewing by all this extra adoption and use of new technology			0
' at the same time we are seeing an increase in viewing among the older age groups			0
' some 40 per cent of households had only one tv set in 2011 , compared to 35 per cent in 2002			2
in 2011 , individuals watched around 209 minutes of tv on their main set each day , compared to 187 minutes on a main set in 2002			1
' one of the things that has helped drive strong tv viewing figures is the evolution of television technology , ' mr @entity25 added			0
' in the past 10 years we have seen the development of widescreen television , hd television , screens getting flatter and very importantly screens are getting bigger ... ' what this is doing is actually bringing people back into the living room and television is taking on a new role as a family experience whereas 10 years ago , in the early 2000s , we were seeing kids , different members of the family watching different television shows in different rooms using different sets			1
' the quality of the tv viewing experience has improved , the choice of channels has improved			0
' we 've now got new technologies like digital video recorders that are improving the television experience			2
we believe that has all helped to maintain television viewing at around four hours a day			1
' he said that if younger members of the family did watch different shows , they now tended to use a laptop rather than a different set			0
' kids are now more likely to watch stuff on their computer or on their laptop through the iplayer rather than go up and watch television , ' he said			0
' the proportion of digitally enabled second tv sets is relatively low compared to the proportion of analogue tv sets say 10 years ago			0
' they 're not replacing their tvs in their bedrooms			0
they 're relying on laptops or different screens			2
we 're not going to see that mass adoption of tv screens all around the house			2
' glued : in 2011 , individuals watched around 209 minutes of tv on their main set each day , compared to 187 minutes on a main set in 2002 while tv watching has remained stable , the long - term radio listening trend has gone down			1
in 2011 , @entity13 adults spent 22.5 hours a week listening to the radio , down from 24 hours in 2001			1
but the figure was up by 24 minutes on 2010			0
among 15 - to 24 - year - olds , the long - term downwards listening trend was even more pronounced , by 22 per cent compared with 2001			2
@entity135 was the most popular digital - only station , reaching 1.5 million listeners in the first quarter of 2012			2
mr @entity25 said : ' there has been a gradual decline in listening , being driven primarily by the younger age group			0
' while they have remained pretty consistent with their tv viewing their radio viewing has gone down significantly			0
' in the future we 're likely to see these trends continuing			0

@entity13 viewers spend an average 4 hours a day in front of the *box* - up from 3.6 hours in 2002
@entity7 suggests new technologies like @entity155 , flat screens and bigger screen sizes have drawn viewers back
