a young woman was so desperate to find the father of her unborn son that she posted an ad on @entity4 with unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers			1
@entity7 , 24 , had a one night stand with a man in @entity9 , @entity10 on april 23 this year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome			1
for five months , @entity7 frantically searched for the father but had no luck as she only knew his first name and what suburb he lived in			1
' i was at my wits end , ' she told @entity19			2
' i tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant i do n't give up despite exhausting all avenues			0
' i stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen , maybe i will get lucky , ' she said			0
' unfortunately all i got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be @entity47			1
' the most offensive messages were from people saying that @entity7 , who is due in mid january , should have opted for a termination			1
' when it was shared on the @entity54 bible page a lot of people made single - minded comments aimed at me , no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant , ' she said			1
' sometimes i want to be like one of those people on @entity61 screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they 're booing about ! ' @entity7 was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby @entity7 ( pictured before being pregnant ) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome @entity7 was n't exactly shocked to be called names like a ' sl * * ' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying ' kill it '			1
' it was sad to see people saying i should get an abortion , those were the only comments that hurt			0
' ' society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship , ' she said			0
' i was more mad at the amount of women ( mums included ) saying i should n't go through with it			0
' but @entity7 has risen above the horrendous backlash and ca n't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months			1
' all i can say is i chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because i did n't think i could have children , ' she said			0
' even though i knew this guy had disappeared i did n't want to give up my chance and i 'm so grateful i did n't			2
' @entity7 is due in mid january and ca n't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months despite the fall - out from the ad - @entity7 has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends			1
' it has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person , ' she said			0
' i could n't be happier , i am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment			0
' she is also looking forward to getting back into shape ' excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape ! ' she said			0
' i hate that i 'm so limited physically			0
' @entity7 still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son 's life			1
' i do hope that i can find him and let him know , he can make his own choice , ' she said			2
' but more for the sake of the kid , when he asks questions or wants to find him i want to be prepared			2
' she still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son 's life			2
