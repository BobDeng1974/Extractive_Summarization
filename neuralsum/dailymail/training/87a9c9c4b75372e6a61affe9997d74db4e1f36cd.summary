the world ’s largest gingerbread house has been constructed in @entity2 and it ’s big enough to board a family of five and packs a gut - busting 35 million calories			1
members of the @entity8 , @entity6 pitched in november 30 to snag the @entity9 with the help of nearly one ton of butter , 7,200 eggs , and thousands more pounds brown sugar and flour			1
‘ basically it has everything but indoor plumbing , ’ said @entity15 , general manager of the @entity6			1
that ’s 39,201.8 cubic feet of magic , according to @entity47 — big enough to muscle out the previous record that was set in 2006 at @entity51 ’s @entity50			2
‘ i think what impresses me most is the community spirit around the record attempt , ’ @entity15 ’s colleague @entity52 told @entity53			2
‘ people came together for this remarkable cause and really worked hard at it			0
’ the astonishing home was built as a tourist attraction with proceeds all going to the trauma program at nearby @entity64			1
what ’s more , nearly all the supplies used in the construction were donated			0
holiday wonderland : @entity69 is allowed a close peek at the amazing house , but most visitors are kept a safe distance form its delectable facade challenges : the house has seen its roadbumps including melting heat and dissolving rain and humidity that would make any gingerbread man wobble sweet deal : proceeds benefit the trauma program at nearby @entity64 in less than a week , the house has raised $ 150,000 and attracts 600 people per night			1
according to today , a local home builder and architect designed the home , but it was @entity15 who dreamed it up			0
‘ i ’m both a @entity94 junkie and a @entity96 guy , and twelve to fourteen months ago i saw something about gingerbread houses , and it spurred me to find out what the largest one ever built was , ’ @entity15 said			2
once he found that out , there was no stopping him			0
@entity105 ambitions : this mockup shows one vision creators had for the record - breaking gingerbread house not all sugar and spice : the house contains a skeleton of wood and that holds all the gingerbread together			1
but the entire facade is edible kind souls : the house was built entirely by volunteers and contains a whopping 22,300 pieces of candy ‘ in june , i was at a luncheon with @entity124 , and i got this crazy idea to build the world ’s largest gingerbread house and combine it with their drive to build a center for their trauma program , and they bit , ’ he explained			1
the house construction was not without its kinks			2
humidity and heat are issues they ’ve had to contest with , but that ’s not all			0
‘ the biggest issue has been bees , ’ @entity15 said			0
‘ we called in a beekeeper the other night and he said there was a cluster of about 2,000 bees			2
we ’ve worked all around them through the process			0
they ’re not bothering us			0
they ’re just getting drunk on sugar			0
’ the house costs $ 2 for children and $ 3 for adults and will stand through mid-december .			1

the 22 - foot house was built by a group of volunteers from @entity8 , @entity2 's @entity6
the proceeds will benefit the nearby @entity64
in less than a week , the house has raised $ 150,000 and attracted 600 per night
