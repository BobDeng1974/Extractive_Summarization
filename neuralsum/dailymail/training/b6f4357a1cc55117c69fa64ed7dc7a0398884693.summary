@entity0 marked his first league start in more than seven months with the winning goal as @entity3 sank @entity4 1 - 0 at the den. the @entity7 defender had just one @entity9 appearance to his name this season having been sidelined since march with an @entity13 injury			1
but he powered home a second - half header to end @entity3 's eight - game winless run and also halt @entity4 's winning start under new manager @entity19			1
@entity3 's @entity0 rises above the rest to head his team in front against @entity4 on saturday afternoon @entity0 celebrates his goal with his @entity3 team - mates in @entity26 clash at @entity27 @entity29 's men had failed to win any of their previous eight games before the victory against @entity4 however @entity19 will be wondering how his @entity4 side , who are still winless on the road this season , did not take the lead late in the first half			1
instead @entity3 were indebted to a stunning double save from former @entity39 goalkeeper @entity38 to deny @entity40 and then , from close range , @entity42			0
neither @entity38 nor opposite number @entity43 had been called into action for the majority of the half due to some wayward finishing from both sides			0
@entity50 fired wide and @entity51 headed over for @entity3 while @entity52 and @entity42 sent presentable opportunities over the crossbar for the visitors			0
@entity3 's @entity56 tussles with @entity52 of @entity4 in a deserved win for the home side @entity59 ( centre ) dribbles through @entity4 's @entity61 and @entity62 but 10 minutes before the interval a slip in the @entity3 defence saw the ball break to @entity40 on the left - hand side of the area			1
the winger drove in a volley which @entity38 got down well to block , but only as far as @entity42 who had what appeared a simple task to tap the ball into an empty net from all of six yards out			0
however , @entity38 managed to spring back up and spread himself to deny the striker with his legs in spectacular fashion			0
that save proved all the more vital nine minutes into the second half when @entity0 , named captain on his return to the starting line - up , made the breakthrough			0
@entity85 ( left ) is put under pressure by @entity3 striker @entity51 near the @entity4 area @entity0 had just one @entity9 appearance to his name this season having been sidelined since march @entity50 whipped in a corner from the right and @entity0 rose above @entity93 and @entity62 at the far post to thump a downward header through a crowd of players and into the net			1
@entity3 could have added to their lead but @entity51 lobbed over the crossbar when clean through and then missed the rebound after @entity103 's shot was parried , while @entity104 drove wide from 15 yards			2
@entity4 had a late penalty shout for handball against @entity0 , after a mazy run from sub @entity108 , waved away as the @entity109 held out for a much - needed win .			2

@entity0 scores for @entity3 after his goal just before the hour mark
@entity29 's men had failed to win any of their previous eight games
@entity4 have now failed to win any of their last seven away games in the *championship* this season , drawing four and losing three
