@entity0 could not have wished for a better start at @entity2			1
from the 7 - 0 opening win over @entity5 to the victory over @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity3 returns home with the @entity10 , @entity11 and , most importantly , an unbeaten record			1
it sounds a simple enough quality but one that can not be underestimated at @entity2 after the club ’s shocking decline under @entity28			0
the @entity29 has taken largely the same group and transformed them into a team which , even at this early stage , will clearly be a very different proposition			0
whether it was the faultless penalties in the shootout win over @entity36 or the character shown to come back and beat @entity7 , @entity2 are already playing for their new manager and that is half the battle			1
not giving in : @entity2 came from behind to defeat @entity7 in their latest pre-season friendly 2			1
the @entity29 is not scared to make radical changes			0
the new 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 formation is quite a departure from @entity2 formations under sir @entity47 and @entity28 , but @entity3 believes that is the best system to get the most out of the players at his disposal			1
rather than simply throwing money at new signings , he is prepared to alter the fundamental line - up of the team to suit the players he has			0
those who do n’t fit into his plans – @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 – will not be kept hanging around			0
they will be shipped out at the first opportunity			0
on the move ? @entity3 looks set to allow several players to leave the club , including @entity57 ( above ) 3			2
@entity17 is onside with the new regime			0
having almost left @entity2 in @entity47 ’s final season because of the favouritism shown towards @entity71 , and then been cajoled back into line by @entity28 , there were concerns that @entity3 ’s close relationship with @entity75 would alienate @entity17 all over again			1
instead , he has scored five goals on tour , won the @entity78 at the @entity11 and impressed the manager to such an extent that he is set to be named captain ahead of @entity75			2
you only had to listen to @entity3 and @entity17 speaking about one another in @entity8 to see that the @entity84 striker is happy with the situation			2
stick with me : @entity17 ( right ) looks to be happy playing under the new @entity2 boss in the mood : @entity17 ( above ) has scored five goals during @entity2 's impressive pre-season tour silverware : @entity91 and @entity17 lift the @entity11 2014 @entity92 4			1
@entity93 is @entity2 's first choice no 10			1
ignore the fact he wears @entity96 , @entity93 ’s deployment in that role behind two strikers in @entity3 ’s new formation on tour shows that he has the manager ’s faith			1
he never looked comfortable playing in a wider position under @entity28 following hsi £ 37.1million move from @entity106 , and there were even questions about his future at @entity110 when @entity3 came in			0
but @entity93 has benefitted from the manager ’s willingness to mould the system around the players he likes , and the @entity115 appears much happier in the new system			0
@entity61 , on the other hand , has been deemed surplus to requirements			0
in the middle : @entity93 will be @entity2 's first choice no 10 after a good pre-season with @entity3 's side in action : @entity125 competes with @entity93 during the @entity11 2014 final 5			1
@entity127 has a future at @entity2 after all			2
if you had to draw up a list of players likely to leave @entity110 if @entity28 had stayed at the club , @entity127 would have been towards the front of the queue right behind @entity59			0
even when @entity3 took over , his aversion to using out - and - out wingers meant that @entity127 , @entity58 and @entity137 were immediately under threat			2
@entity127 has tried to reinvent himself as a wing - back in the mould of @entity141 , even though his defensive deficiencies were exposed by @entity143 against @entity7			2
that is something he needs to work on , but going forward @entity127 was a real threat and looks like he has a new lease of life at @entity2			0
@entity149 wants reinforcements new skill : @entity127 has tried to reinvent himself as a wing - back in the mould of @entity141 easy street : @entity93 scores against @entity154 during @entity2 's unbeaten pre-season tour redemption : @entity127 's @entity2 career has been given a new lease of life by @entity3 chance : @entity137 ( left ) could see more football under @entity3 than he did under @entity28			1

@entity0 's @entity2 side remain unbeaten in pre-season tour of the @entity16
@entity2 come from behind to defeat @entity166 *rivals* @entity7
@entity3 's pre-season campaign began with a 7 - 0 win against @entity5
red *devils* leave @entity16 with @entity10 and @entity11
@entity17 seems to be *enjoying* working under new boss
@entity93 looks set to play in his favoured no 10 role for @entity2
@entity127 's @entity2 career has been *rejuvenated*
