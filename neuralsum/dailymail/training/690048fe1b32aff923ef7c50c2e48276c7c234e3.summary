the family of a senior @entity2 commander tried to get @entity4 's film oh ! what a @entity5 banned because they regarded it as a ' sordid ' insult to his memory			1
descendants of the @entity12 sir @entity11 , who led the @entity13 from 1914 to 1915 , took legal advice and appealed to the film censor			1
on july 7 , 1968 , his son colonel @entity11 , who has also since died , wrote to the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , calling it a ' despicable attempt to create sensation for the sordid purpose of making money '			1
the family 's letters have been found in the @entity17 archive			1
he said that it was anti-war , but very ' pro-soldier '			0
in his letter to sir @entity38 , the then director of the @entity17 , @entity36 is particularly alarmed by reports that his father who is to be played by sir @entity41 will be seen dancing while the casualties continue to mount up on the front line			1
he wrote : ' it appears to be a disgraceful performance making fun of a time of great national peril and falsely portraying the commander - in - chief as indulging in dancing while the fighting was going on and his men were being killed			0
' ' in appealing to your board to prevent this despicable attempt to create sensation for the sordid purpose of making money , i would point out that not only the reputation of a great soldier is involved but the prestige of the @entity63			0
@entity41 's depiction of sir @entity11 ( pictured ) was seen as prancing and pouting by critics colonel @entity11 said the production should either be banned or the offensive references to his father should be removed			1
three days after receiving the letter @entity38 wrote to @entity71 to warn him of the @entity67 's concerns			2
@entity4 assured @entity38 that the film was anti-war rather than anti any particular soldier			2
he wrote : ' when the first letter arrived , i held a special screening of all the material for a positive battery of lawyers who unanimously proclaimed that the film is neither libellous or offensive			2
he added : ' let me assure you @entity11 that i would never have anything to do with a film such as the one colonel @entity36 mentions in his letter and in fact i believe that the only way to be truly ante - war is to be pro â€“ soldiers , for if one dislikes the soldiers , it 's difficult to get concerned when they become casualties			1
' ' as you know we have totally eschewed blood and gore and are trying to make our points by means of speech based upon historical record			0
i can not believe that colonel @entity36 would wish to curb my right to read history aloud			0
' just weeks earlier @entity4 wrote to @entity38 to share the ' dread ' and ' insane ' news that he was about to direct his first film			2
@entity4 's 1969 film oh ! what a @entity5 starring @entity107 as the @entity108 and @entity109 as @entity110 @entity111 starred in the film as @entity113 alongside @entity41 @entity4 who would go on to direct a string of hit films including @entity116 , shadowlands and @entity118 wrote : ' you might have heard but in case you have n't i write to tell you of the dread news that i am about to take the fatal step of directing my first film			2
nothing easy of course , like a contained little domestic drama , but a picture shot entirely on location with almost 40 musical numbers in it and a cast that would put your eye out			0
you see , i am insane , ' sir @entity11 carved out a reputation for himself during the @entity137 , he headed the @entity13 for the first two years of the @entity2 and was then made commander in chief , @entity139			1
he retired from the @entity63 in april 1921 and was elevated to the @entity140 in 1922			0
opinion about @entity36 's contribution to the war effort remains divided to this day			0
the late @entity144 described him as weak willed man of medium height in @entity147 his seminal history of the first world war			0
but other commentators have been far more generous and they stress that @entity36 was a far more popular figure in the ranks than other senior figures like @entity154 or @entity155			0
his family may have been right , however , to be wary of how @entity41 performance which was subsequently described as pouting and prancing			0
sir @entity11 died aged 72 in 1925 and his son died in 1958			1
@entity41 's depiction of sir @entity11 was seen as prancing and pouting by critics .			1
