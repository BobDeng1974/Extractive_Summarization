the pilot who died in a tragic accident aboard @entity3 's @entity2 has been identified			1
@entity4 , a father of two and pilot with @entity6 , was killed on friday when @entity2 exploded just minutes after it detached from its mother ship , @entity8			1
@entity9 , @entity10 's widow , told @entity11 , ' i have lost the love of my life			1
i am living in hell right now			2
' the identity of the other pilot , who was critically injured when he ejected from the plane at 45,000 feet , is still unknown			2
@entity4 , 39 , had piloted @entity2 as recently as august 28			1
it crashed to the ground in a remote region of @entity33 's @entity32 , killing one pilot and seriously injuring another addressing the media at the crash site on saturday morning , @entity3 ceo @entity35 said , ' this is a very tough time for all of us at @entity2 , @entity40 and @entity6 , and our thoughts remain with the families of the brave @entity6 pilots , and all those affected by this tragedy			1
' he added , ' in testing the boundaries of human capabilities and technologies , we are standing on the shoulders of giants			0
yesterday , we fell short			0
we will now comprehensively assess the results of the crash and are determined to learn from this and move forward together as a company			0
' @entity35 then closed out his statement by saying , ' i truly believe that humanity ’s greatest achievements come out of our greatest pain			2
this team is a group of the bravest , brightest , most determined and most resilient people i have ever had the privilege of knowing			0
we are determined to honour the bravery of the pilots and teams here by learning from this tragedy			0
only then can we move forward , united behind a collective desire to push the boundaries of human endeavor			0
' @entity35 also said he had never met @entity4 before , though photo and video evidence of the two celebrating a successful run in april 2013 seems to suggest otherwise			1
the two are seen clearly talking and posing for photos in video released by @entity2 , making the blunder that much more embarrassing for @entity35 and his team			1
past meeting : oddly , @entity35 said he had never met @entity4 , even though the two can be seen talking and celebrating following a flight in april 2013 pilot pals : @entity10 ( second from left ) with fellow pilots ( left to right ) @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 @entity35 flew to the site of the crash immediately after the tragedy occurred on friday , and has been working closely with authorities to try and determine what went wrong during friday 's flight			1
even though @entity35 claims he had never met him , @entity4 was one of the biggest contributors to the man 's dream of sending people into space from the beginning			1
@entity4 had flown numerous missions on @entity2 for years , including the all important first successful rocket - powered run in april 2013			1
he was also the pilot in the first glide flight back in 2010 , and flew as recently as august 28 of this year			2
in video from the 2013 mission , it is clear what a humble man @entity4 was , and just how dedicated he was to his job			1
as @entity35 and @entity2 exec @entity111 proudly talk about all they have accomplished , and how ' jazzed ' they are with the success of the run , @entity10 and fellow pilot @entity87 say nothing and seem to avoid the spotlight , this even though they had just accomplished the remarkable feat of piloting @entity2 as it broke the sound barrier			1
speaking with @entity11 , neighbor @entity119 said of @entity4 , ' he ’s one of a kind , very , very special , an incredible individual who everybody liked			1
' he added , ' @entity123 was just an incredible human being and my friend			0
he was a kind , unselfish man and i ’m going to miss him			0
everybody here will miss him			0
' the 39 - year - old leaves behind two children , a son and a daughter , and his wife @entity9			1
said @entity119 , ' they are the perfect , ideal family , great neighbors and great friends			0
' in a blog - post en route , @entity35 wrote : ' i am writing this as we refuel on one of the most difficult trips i have ever had to make			1
i will be in @entity32 soon to join the @entity2 and @entity149 teams involved in the @entity2 flight test program			1
' @entity32 is also where i want to be – with the dedicated and hard - working people who are now in shock at this devastating loss ... we ’ve always known that the road to space is extremely difficult - and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history			2
' he concluded : ' space is hard - but worth it			2
we will persevere and move forward together			0
' in a press conference friday afternoon , @entity111 , chief executive of @entity2 , said ; ‘ our primary thoughts at the moment are with the crew and families and we are doing everything we can for them now			2
' ' @entity160 is hard , and today was a tough day			0
the future rest on hard days like this			0
' briefing : @entity4 ( second from left ) getting briefed by @entity172 ( center ) before the april 2013 flight @entity175 , who is in charge of the @entity177 , where @entity2 was launched friday , also remained optimistic about the future of space travel			1
he said : ' stay the course			0
if it was easy it would not be interesting to me and my colleagues standing next to me			0
' ‘ we are doing this for you and your generation			0
it is a cause far greater than any one of us singularly			0
i compare it to the @entity191 expedition [ the first circumnavigation of the @entity193 ]			0
’ the @entity194 ( @entity194 ) , has also launched an investigation into the crash			0
pet project : @entity35 applauds @entity4 after his successful run in april 2013 celebrate : @entity35 then posed for photos with @entity4 and @entity87 in may , @entity2 announced it was switching the fuel used in the vehicle 's hybrid rocket motor , hydroxyl - terminated polybutadiene , a form of rubber , to a polyamide - based plastic			1
during a media tour of @entity2 's @entity32 facilities on october 4 that marked the tenth anniversary of the final flight of @entity212 , the suborbital vehicle that won the $ 10 - million @entity214 , company officials said they expected to resume powered test flights ' imminently ' once qualification tests of the new motor were done			1
at the @entity219 in @entity220 , @entity221 , on october 15 , @entity2 chief executive @entity111 said the company had completed those qualification tests			1
' we expect to get back into powered test flight quite soon , ' he said			0
@entity2 has been under development at @entity227 and @entity228 in the desert northeast of @entity230			2
@entity2 is carried aloft by a specially designed mothership and then released before igniting its rocket for suborbital thrill ride into space and then a return to @entity193 as a glider			1
ticket cost : the starting price for flights is $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by @entity35 and his family			1
training : passengers are required to go through a ' @entity243 ' , including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly			0
once aboard : @entity2 will carry six passengers and two pilots			2
each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead			0
a climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites			0
passengers become ' astronauts ' when they reach the @entity269 line , the boundary of @entity193 's atmosphere , at which point @entity2 separates from its carrier aircraft , @entity261 the spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness , with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours.the spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound the space ship is 60ft long with a 90inch diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity			1
flight path : a climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites			2
passengers become ' astronauts ' when they reach the @entity269 line , the boundary of @entity193 's atmosphere , at which point @entity2 separates from its carrier aircraft , @entity261 the spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness , with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours			1
the spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound flight frequency : initially one per week , eventually to have two flights per day			2
@entity35 ’s big project has also attracted a slew of big name passengers happy to pay for this once in a lifetime experience , including newlyweds @entity296 and @entity298 ; @entity299 and his manager @entity300 ; @entity301 , who plans to try and sing in space ; former pop star @entity303 , who has long been vocal about his desire to head to space ; @entity306 , who was the 500th customer to purchase a ticket ; @entity308 ; @entity309 ; and @entity310 , who would be the first royal in space and who dates @entity314 , an executive at @entity2			1
@entity315 also got a ticket for his birthday from ex-wife @entity318 when the two were married			0
@entity320 bought a ticket as well so @entity315 would not have to go alone			0
@entity322 and @entity323 are also set to fly , but got their seats for free			0
@entity323 because she is married to @entity35 ’s nephew , @entity327 , and @entity322 because @entity35 wanted to offer the legendary astrophysicist a chance to go into space .			2
