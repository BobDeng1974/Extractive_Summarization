there were some big calls at @entity2 , but @entity3 were the deserving winners of a terrific game which leaves me thinking there are direct comparisons between @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity9 , rather like @entity10 at present , have the team ethic , work - rate and commitment that every coach dreams of and are hugely competitive			1
but at the elite level , they are a couple of world - class players short of being able to seal the deal			0
@entity3 in contrast had the two ‘ special ’ players on view yesterday in @entity24 and @entity25 who would both command a place in any current @entity27 on form like that			2
dejected : @entity9 players stand on the @entity2 pitch helpless after their @entity33 final defeat disappointed : the @entity35 club were on the wrong end of a 24 - 20 defeat champions : @entity3 lifting the @entity33 trophy world class : sir @entity41 believes that @entity42 is a game changer that is two huge finals @entity9 have lost in the last week on top of two big semi-finals last season			1
close , very close , but no cigar			0
i am a big admirer of @entity51 and am much encouraged by what @entity52 has achieved so far with @entity10 but , in both cases , there is another big step to take			2
to win at the elite level you need to either unearth special players or take the shackles off and free those you already have			0
fine player that @entity62 is , @entity9 need a more creative ball player and much better attacking kicker at no. 12			2
this is the case with @entity10 as well			2
to win a @entity68 , @entity10 need at least four star players			2
we saw how the @entity73 - @entity72 axis ran the show for @entity75 against @entity9 in @entity76 last week and i am convinced a @entity80 - @entity79 combo could do the same for @entity10 , assuming the @entity10 forwards continue their upward path			1
@entity79 worries me a little in the short term , regardless of any injury concerns			0
he was poor yesterday by his own standards and was taught a lesson by @entity73 last week			0
there will be some mental scars there as well as bruises as he flies down to @entity92			0
he will bounce back but its been a tough week or two			0
close , but no cigar : @entity9 needed a more creative number 12 than @entity62 on saturday @entity96 : @entity75 's @entity73 and @entity72 ( bottom ) meanwhile , i love the way @entity24 has been going about his business this season — he is becoming a player of @entity105 ’s stature , that ’s how highly i rate him			1
he used to be a bit ragged and there were occasional flashes of ill - discipline but he has tightened that side of his game and now produces every time he goes on the field			2
@entity114 and the @entity116 coaches have done a fine job with him and he was the player on view yesterday who will have most impressed @entity120 and the @entity92 down in @entity121			0
@entity24 will have a big role to play in the @entity123			0
key man : @entity24 ( top ) can be compared to legendary captain @entity105 says @entity41 last week , @entity127 rugby fans said goodbye to @entity73 in @entity76 and yesterday it was @entity131 ’s turn at @entity2			1
some big names and important players are leaving the arena			0
it was @entity120 ’s great misfortune that his career coincided with a handful of the very best locks in the history of @entity142 rugby - @entity105 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 - but he still won 57 caps and captained his country			2
do n’t underestimate his value			0
@entity131 ’s superb line - out skills and consistency for @entity151 , and then @entity9 , kept @entity10 ’s best locks right on their toes throughout their careers			1
that is gold dust if you are national coach , that strength in depth drives everybody on to new heights			0
bowing out : @entity131 has retired after many years at the top when i worked with @entity120 he was the first forward i had encountered who really wanted to work with coaches to plot and plan line - outs in detail			1
his line - out knowledge is second to none in world rugby and it is strange that @entity10 have not seen this			1
a humble man in the mould of @entity73 , @entity120 has set the tone at @entity9			2
@entity176 has pulled off an outstanding piece of business by signing @entity120 as @entity180 ’s line - out coach for the @entity68			0
he will bring massive technical knowledge to the job			0
i am fascinated by this situation developing with @entity186 full - back @entity184 who has just broken into the @entity10 squad but will be playing with the @entity188 in the @entity190 next season			1
@entity184 has forced his way into @entity10 contention after a fine season in adversity in a struggling team , but is it really possible to challenge for an @entity10 @entity68 place while playing in our second - tier league ? i do n’t think so			1
you have to ask , would @entity201 pick a championship player for a vital @entity10 game at the @entity68 in @entity204 this month ? the answer is ‘ no ’ and the comparison is fair			1
call up : @entity186 full - back @entity184 has just broken into the @entity10 squad @entity184 ’s loyalty to @entity186 is not in question and , of course , ideally @entity210 would want his star player available , but we are talking about the season heading into a home @entity68			1
this is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity and there can be no compromise			0
a solution needs to be found and @entity10 and the @entity220 need to meet @entity186 halfway here			1
@entity184 needs to be loaned out to a @entity33 club for the season and preferably one who have qualified for the @entity224 , because he is playing catch - up and needs as much exposure to that level of rugby as possible			1
in return , the @entity220 should help fund a top - quality overseas test full - back replacement for @entity184 at @entity231			1
this is a time for solutions , not questions			0
the @entity33 or @entity235 ’s @entity234 — which is the best ? both flagship national leagues have enjoyed really good seasons and drive each other on , but for me the @entity234 just nicks it			1
the dazzling array of world talent in @entity235 makes for an intoxicating mix that will eventually inspire rather than baulk young @entity235 talent			2
divide : @entity244 won the @entity246 award whilst playing for @entity75 but is excluded from playing for @entity10 the atmosphere at some games - i was at @entity250 recently - is extraordinary , but what clinches it is that in @entity235 winning the @entity234 is still rated above winning the @entity253			1
that adds an incredible intensity to proceedings			0
would n’t it be interesting to stage an annual game between the two leagues in which the overseas players would all be available			0

@entity3 beat @entity9 24 - 20 ( @entity263 ) in the @entity33 final
@entity131 bows out as one of the greats of the game
@entity184 must leave @entity186 to further @entity10 career
@entity235 's @entity234 is better than @entity33 believes @entity41
