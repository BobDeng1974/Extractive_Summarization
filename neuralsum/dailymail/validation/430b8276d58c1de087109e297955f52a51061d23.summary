a @entity1 artist living in @entity2 has created a collection of tongue - in - cheek posters , depicting life as an ex-pat in the @entity7			1
@entity8 , 36,used her artistic skills to gently poke fun at everything from ubiquitous holiday snaps in front of the @entity15 building to the childcare and home help habits of foreigners living in @entity2			1
the former @entity20 graphic designer said the poster collection is a celebration of one of the world 's most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities			1
inspired by the good life led by ex-pats in @entity2 , @entity8 first got the idea when working on a campaign for the @entity48 at @entity20			1
' @entity2 is a new city and there are none of these old commercial printed ads , so i thought it could be a nice new art space to explore here , ' she tells @entity55			2
@entity2 is known for its many high - end shops , which @entity8 addresses in this ' @entity58 ' poster of ex-pat surrounded by purchases one of the themes in @entity8 's illustrations is to poke good - natured fun at the frequency with which ex-pats employ hired help , such as maids with temperatures of up to 40c in summer , activities such as playing golf are far from recommended in the @entity7 but is living in @entity2 really as glamorous as these posters make it out to be ? ' it depends on where you 're from and what your socioeconomic background is like , ' @entity8 says			1
' for people like myself , an average middle - class ex-pat from the @entity1 , day to day life in @entity2 is generally like living in any cosmopolitan city in the world			1
' people go to work , they take the kids to school , they get coffee , go to the supermarket , you name it , we do it here			0
' the differences - aside from living in sunshine all year round , which improves everyone 's mood massively - are that earnings are tax - free , we have a huge selection of great beaches and you can get anything delivered to your doorstep			0
' i would also say that @entity2 is one of the safest places in the world - every apartment building has a pool , gym and 24/7 security			2
' @entity110 , or @entity110 , is a 1.7 km waterfront area , frequented by ex-pats looking to soak up the sun despite the joking tone of her travel posters , @entity8 insists that most middle - class ex-pats live a relatively normal day - to - day existence ' real food at @entity120 ' : in @entity2 , this cheap @entity122 eatery is known as a great place to get a quick and unpretentious bite taxis are readily available and inexpensive , due to the prices of petrol in the region , but it still may take awhile to get to your destination despite such a reality , @entity8 recognises that it 's not uncommon for @entity1 to have many misconceptions about @entity2			1
' yes , the @entity7 is a @entity135 country , so there are certain laws and rules that might take a bit of getting used to , but the @entity7 is extremely tolerant , ' she explains			2
' after all , there are about eight million expats living here from all over the world			0
' many friends ask about the nightlife here and while we do let our hair down here , it all happens within the confines of licensed bars and clubs , or at home			0
' you do n't walk down the street being openly intoxicated			0
we all respect the culture			0
' @entity8 admits that one of the best things about living in @entity2 is seeing the city develop - both in its infrastructure and also artistically from excursions to @entity162 and @entity163 to having to renewing a visa : day tripping possibilities are endless in @entity2 in a gentle mockery of ex pat living , this image depicts a scruffy - and presumably lazy - young woman takes delivery of a chocolate bar as for @entity8 , who has been in @entity2 for eight years after intending to stay for just 12 months , she ca n't imagine living anywhere else			1
' the best part is seeing how the place is developing , ' she adds			0
' both in terms of infrastructure but also artistically			0
' as more people arrive , you get more diversity			0
' there are so many talented people doing amazing things here and you get the feeling that there 's something exciting happening all the time			0
' people say that @entity2 has no history or soul , but i disagree			2
how much history or soul did @entity35 or @entity194 have when they were only 40 years old ? '			1

@entity35 born @entity8 , 36 , is a graphic designer who moved to @entity2 eight years *ago* to pursue her career
her striking posters illustrate the life of a @entity1 ex-pat , gently poking fun at the *lifestyle* of foreigners in the @entity7
the vintage style is akin to the 30s and 40s travel and tourism adverts typified by @entity43 artist @entity42
