a homeless man who spent five hours dangling upside down after getting stuck in a window has been cleared of burglary after a court heard he had ' just been trying to find somewhere to sleep			1
' @entity5 scaled two fences and shimmied up a drainpipe to reach the window 10ft above the ground of a university building			1
but the 27 - year - old homeless man got his legs caught and he was left suspended upside down by his ankles in freezing conditions			1
mr @entity5 was arrested and charged with attempting to break into the @entity19 building on january 22			1
he was found not guilty of burglary after @entity17 heard he was simply trying to find shelter warm for the night			1
chair of the bench , @entity31 , said : ' we are not satisfied that you entered the building with intent to steal			0
' the court heard @entity37 and fellow student @entity38 were passing the university 's @entity40 building at 3am when they heard mr @entity5 's cries			1
they took photos of the man and made a video before realising the seriousness of the issue and deciding to phone emergency services			0
a fireman eased mr @entity5 through the window after his five hour ordeal at @entity19 in a 34 - second video , which has since received more than 70,000 views on the internet , the students can be heard asking mr @entity5 if there was any way they could help			1
he was freed by firefighters and spent two days at @entity60 before being charged with burglary with intent to steal			2
magistrates heard mr @entity5 had nowhere to stay on the night and after taking amphetamines , found himself in @entity65			1
doctors told mr @entity5 that they would have needed to amputate his leg if he spent a further 30 minutes suspended upside down from the window mr @entity5 said he saw the open sash window and decided to climb inside to find somewhere to sleep , but his plan went wrong when he became wedged			1
now the drug addict has vowed to ' change his ways ' after medics told him he could have lost his legs if he had been suspended any longer			1
mr @entity5 , of no fixed address , said : ' something trapped me in there			1
' i do n't know what it was			0
my legs just got caught and after a while i lost the circulation in my legs			1
i thought i was going to die			0
' i had been there so long , my legs had pins and needles and my shins felt like they had been cut badly			2
' then i saw this guy and he asked me what i was doing up there			0
i said ' it does n't matter what i 'm doing , please help me '			0
' i was n't bothered about the students laughing , i just wanted to get down			0
doctors told me another half an hour and i would have to have my legs amputated			2
' i 'm not a burglar			0
it 's like a lesson being taught			0
i 'm changing my ways			2
' the court heard mr @entity5 had 40 convictions for 69 previous offences , mainly shop thefts , and that he had been served with an anti-social behaviour notice , having previously been found on @entity108 premises			1
@entity109 , defending , said : ' he was a homeless drug addict loner who had nowhere else to go			1
the question is , did he intend to steal ? ' no. what he intended to do was find somewhere warm to go to sleep			2
he had no gloves and no means of carrying any items			2
' during the trial , mr @entity5 said he had not bothered looking for a hostel because he was not registered			1
but a spokesman for homelessness charity framework said : ' help is available for people who find themselves in this situation			0
@entity38 , left , who is studying history , said he initially thought mr @entity5 , top right , was a drunk student ' we will make every effort to find them accommodation in such cold weather			1
' for this reason we would urge anyone who is about to sleep rough to contact our street outreach team by calling our rough sleepers ' hotline on 0800 066 5356			2
' @entity38 , 19 , who is a first year student studying @entity124 , said : ' we initially thought it was a drunk student , because we 've got friends who would probably end up doing something like that			0
' but when we heard he was 27 i thought it might be a bit more sinister and he must have been trying to burgle the place			2
' but i did n't know he was homeless , so i guess that makes a lot of sense			2
' if you were in that situation you would just be desperate to find somewhere warm to sleep - it just went spectacularly badly for this bloke			0
. ' @entity37 , 20 , a property investment and finance student , added : we had been walking home from a night out when we literally stumbled across the guy			0
' all i could see was the lower half of the person 's legs poking out through the open part			0
' i called out ' are you ok ? ' the man 's voice was crying : ' i 've been here five hours , help ! ' ' ' he was crying out shouting ' let me go ' and i dialled 999 and told the operator what had happened			0
' two fire engines and three police cars arrived and they had to cut the guy out of the window			0
' the police took him away in handcuffs and we carried on home			0
