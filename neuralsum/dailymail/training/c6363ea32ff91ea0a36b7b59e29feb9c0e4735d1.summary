two @entity1 sky surveys named @entity2 and @entity3 are expected to discover 700,000 galaxies over the course of the new year			1
the huge new radio telescope facility in @entity7 will scour vast regions of space to provide clues about galaxy evolution			1
the £ 65m @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is located in a remote desert region of @entity7 , 196 miles from the port of @entity15			2
@entity12 will also help astronomers investigate one of the greatest mysteries of the universe : dark energy			0
this is the force which appears to be causing galaxies to fly apart at an accelerating rate			0
although no one is sure what dark energy is , it is believed to account for 73 per cent of the universe			0
scientists were able to predict @entity12 's capabilities by combining its specifications with computer simulations			2
dr @entity41 , a member of the @entity12 team from the @entity43 , said : ' @entity12 is a highly capable telescope			0
its surveys will find more galaxies , further away , and will be able to study them in more detail than any other radio telescope in the world			1
' we predict that @entity2 will find an amazing 600,000 new galaxies and @entity54 , spread over trillions of cubic light years of space			0
' on its first day in full operation , @entity12 will collect more data than is currently contained in all current radio astronomy archives or the @entity61 the telescope will examine galactic hydrogen gas – the fuel that forms stars – to see how galaxies have changed in the past 4bn years			2
@entity12 is a curtain raiser for an even more ambitious project , the @entity69 ( @entity69 )			1
with receiving stations stretching between @entity71 , @entity7 and @entity72 , @entity69 will be the world 's largest radio telescope when it begins operating in 2019			1
its combined antennae will provide radiation - collecting area of approximately 1 sq km. the @entity12 telescope is located in the @entity80 , an area of 50,000 square kms ( 19,300 square miles ) , or the size of @entity84 , with barely 120 people			0
the location is ideal because it is ' radio quiet ' , or lacks man - made radio signals that would interfere with the antennas picking up astronomical radio signals			0
using new ' radio cameras ' called phased array feeds , the telescope will be able scan the sky much more rapidly than existing radio telescopes and will give the telescope a field of view about 150 times the area of the @entity99			2
@entity12 is also the first building block in the world 's largest telescope , the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) which will be based in both @entity7 and @entity71 one of the antenna of the @entity1 @entity105 telescope the telescope will also search for alien life , although that is not its primary purpose			1

the two new sky surveys will use data from an array of 36 antennas each 12 meters ( 40 feet ) across
project is also the first building block in the world 's largest telescope , the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) which will be based in both @entity7 and @entity71
