gunned down by the @entity105 : @entity300 ' @entity299 ' @entity298 @entity300 ' @entity298 was the mother of five sons who ran the @entity298 crime gang in 1930 's @entity304			1
the popular image of @entity298 is of a criminal mastermind , @entity308 machine gun in hand , leading her boys out on hits against rival gangs during the heyday of the ' @entity315 ' era			0
but this was later found to have been at best exaggerated and at worst fabricated by the @entity105			0
while her sons were undoubtedly guilty of crimes including murder , robbery and kidnap , there is no evidence that @entity325 ever took part herself			2
however that is not say she was innocent - she would do everything within her power to protect her boys and helped them to evade capture on numerous occasions			0
she knew what they were up to , looked after them and helped them before and after they committed their crimes			0
they travelled together as mother and sons so as not to arouse suspicion of law enforcement			2
most notoriously , she died , aged 61 , in a hail of bullets , @entity308 in hand , during a ferocious battle with the @entity105 at her home in @entity349 , @entity350			0
official @entity105 reports from 1935 say that agents began the shoot - out at the @entity298 household by throwing three canisters of tear gas inside the house at 7.15 a.m. shooting began soon afterwards and the @entity359 were reported to have used @entity308 machine guns to attempt to repel the federal agents			0
three hours later , the agents reportedly had almost run out of ammunition and asked @entity364 , a handyman on the estate to check that @entity298 and her son were indeed dead			0
finding that they were , agents detailed the scene and noted that @entity325 had died in a curled - up position , her slippers on the floor nearby , beneath the bedroom window			0
some have suggested that the myth of @entity325 as the gang leader was created by @entity379 @entity378 to justify the killing by police of an old woman .			0
