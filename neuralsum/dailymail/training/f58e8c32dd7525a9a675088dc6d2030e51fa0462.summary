by @entity1 reporter published : 18:09 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 14:31 est , 29 october 2012 the billionaire owner of a $ 90 million condominium at a new luxury @entity5 building could only have to pay an estimated $ 20,000 in property taxes - a far cry from the $ 230,000 the city is owed			1
the staggering tax break for residents of @entity12 , a stunning 95 story residential building under construction on @entity15 , is intended for property developers who designate 20 per cent of their units to low income families			1
though the building could reap the benefit of the city 's housing program , the low income renters wo n't be housed in the posh building and instead will be placed in subsidized units in the outer boroughs of @entity27			1
opulent : @entity12 will be @entity27 's tallest residential once it opens in 2013 luxury : the building , located at 157 west 57th street in @entity5 , is currently under construction and was designed by @entity33 architect @entity32 @entity12 , @entity27 's tallest residential building - to - be , has been under construction since 2009 and is set to open in 2013			2
full - floor apartments start at floor 77 , with the @entity37 at the base , and the starting price for a space in the tower is reportedly $ 45 million			0
the tower , designed by @entity33 architect @entity32 , will offer luxury amenities like a full service spa , a screening room , private dining room , a full spa and even a pet wash room			0
the billionaires behind fashion label @entity51 , @entity53 and @entity54 , have both signed contracts for $ 50 million full - floor apartments in the tower at 157 w. 57th street			0
a sprawling 13,554 square foot apartment on the 75th and 76th floor on the building , reportedly sold for $ 90 million to an unknown buyer and the penthouse of @entity12 , located on the 89th and 90th floors , was rumored to have sold for $ 95 million			1
for the $ 95 million property , in normal circumstances taxes would ring up to roughly $ 230,000 annually but with the developer 's tax benefit , the wealthy buyer could only have to hand over less than 10 per cent of the tax bill , or $ 20,000 , to @entity70			1
high end : the units at the @entity5 tower reportedly start at $ 45 million stunning : the building overlooks @entity75 and comes with a slew of amenities including an indoor pool , a screening room , a pet - wash room , an arts atelier and a full service spa the @entity27 @entity83 ( @entity84 ) and the @entity85 administers the housing program , known as 421 , that provides a tax abatement to property developers that allocate residential units to the needy for a reduced price			1
luxury developers have taken advantage of the program , taking the tax break for units in high - priced buildings but not carving out space in those builders for lower income renters			1
instead , developers tend to provide low cost real estate in less expensive neighborhoods outside of @entity5			2
the developer of the luxury building , set to open in 2013 , has applied for the 421 exemption but has not yet been deemed eligible for the tax benefit , according to @entity110			2
high five : @entity53 , left , and @entity112 , second from right , celebrate the ipo for the label of fashion designer @entity51 , second left , in december 2011 but just the possibility of the tax benefit for the @entity117 of @entity27 , is causing an uproar			0
one local politician has decried the practice and is calling for an end to the entitlement			0
' this is an outrageous giveaway , ' @entity124 , a @entity27 councilman told @entity110			2
' we ca n't afford to be giving away millions of dollars in tax breaks for nothing			0
' the tax break is estimated to have cost the city more than $ 1 billion in lost tax revenue , according to the city â€™s @entity132			1
but the head of @entity135 , the company overseeing the construction of @entity12 , insisted that they have followed the city 's guidelines			0
' we 've had some benefit because of the abatements , but the real benefits have been to affordable housing , ' @entity140 , founder of @entity141 , told @entity110			0
' we 've done exactly what the program was intended to do , which is to create affordable housing			0

housing program , known as 421 , provides tax break for real estate developers who allocate 20 per cent of units for lower income residents
luxury building , one 57 , could be eligible for the benefit but will not be housing lower income renters
for $ 90 million penthouse , owner could only be *responsible* for $ 20,000 for $ 230,000 total tax bill
the property tax break has cost the city $ 1 billion in total tax revenue
local @entity27 councilman is calling for an end to the ' outrageous giveaway '
