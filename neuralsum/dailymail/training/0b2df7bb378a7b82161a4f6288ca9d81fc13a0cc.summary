by @entity0 published : 11:02 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 13:58 est , 30 march 2013 a man will spend his life in jail along with the hit man he hired from jail to kill his wife and family , but surviving relatives say they are n’t safe even with the man who tried to have them killed behind bars			1
police encountered an unthinkably gruesome scene at the home of @entity15 and @entity16 in february 2011			1
despicable : @entity21 , once a ' dashing ' @entity20 dancer , will spend his life in prison for having his wife and brother - in - law killed at the end of a trail of human teeth lay the body of @entity30 , an ordained minister , in a pool of his own blood			1
he ’d suffered a gunshot wound , stab wounds in the neck , and showed evidence he ’d been beaten			0
the body of @entity38 , 39 , lay nearby , too bloody for police to see the gunshot wound , but with the deep gash in her neck visible			0
the intruder had also tried to set fire to the @entity46 , @entity47 home			0
@entity38 was the @entity16 ’s sister - in - law , her husband @entity21 was @entity16 ’s brother			1
after years of escalating drug use , violent threats , and a restraining order barring @entity21 from having contact with his wife and daughter , @entity38 took her daughter and moved into the @entity16 home out of fear her husband would harm her and her daughter			1
but on february 23 , 2011 , @entity21 was harmed anyway			2
a man dressed as a ninja entered the @entity16 home and brutally slayed @entity30 , 49 , and @entity38 , all while @entity21 ’ 6 - year - old daughter @entity64 watched , horrified			1
the investigation and later accounts would paint @entity16 as a hero who fought to his death to protect the 6 - year - old and her mother			0
ghastly : in feb. 2011 , @entity21 ' daughter awoke to find her mother and uncle being shot and stabbed to death in this home in a quiet , secluded residential @entity47 community almost safe : @entity38 ( right ) and her daughter had fled from her drug - addicted , violent husband but he put a bounty on her head from jail sgt. @entity83 of the @entity84 , @entity47 sheriff ’s department was among the first to arrive at the scene and would later testify to all its gory details , but also to an uplifting one			1
@entity64 , who ’d only just seen her mother and uncle savagely slaughtered , was trying to be strong			0
‘ i have never seen a child go through such trauma and be so strong , ’ @entity83 told @entity90 in a march 29 episode of 20/20			0
‘ that little girl is absolutely nothing more than amazing			0
’ prosecutors in the case said that @entity64 woke up and saw the attacks , then ran to a neighbor ’s to call 911			0
investigators logically suspected @entity101 , who ’d been arrested four times for violating the restraining order his wife held			1
according to the family , former @entity20 dancer @entity21 was once dashing , but had become heavily addicted to methamphetamine and increasingly hostile in the time leading up to his wife leaving with the girl			1
while @entity21 ’ and her daughter settled into life with the @entity113 , @entity21 ’ behavior took and an even more disturbing turn			1
hero : @entity30 , an ordained minister , tried valiantly to fight off the intruder who eventually murdered him and his sister - in - law @entity38 ’ sister @entity118 described one particularly horrifying incident the occurred after @entity101 called to say he was dropping by to leave his wife and daughter ’s belongings at the end of the @entity16 ’s driveway			1
‘ all of the sudden i heard [ @entity38 ] scream , ’ @entity118 said			0
‘ she was standing there holding her wedding dress and he urinated across it and wrote a profanity			0
’ though he seemed disturbed enough to have committed the heinous crime , investigators hit a roadblock when they realized @entity21 was in jail at the time of the double murder			1
@entity83 and the other investigators remained convinced of @entity21 ’ involvement , however , they visited the car dealership where @entity21 worked and interviewed his co-woker , 27 - year - old @entity141			2
@entity141 had a suspicious wound on his head and police took him in for questioning			0
@entity141 would eventually admit to the killings and implicate three others , including @entity21 , in the killings			2
sick duo : high on cocaine and wearing a ninja outfit , @entity141 ( left ) broke in to his victims ' home , shot , and stabbed @entity30 and @entity38 to death while @entity155 ( right ) waited in the getaway vehicle he told them a middle - man named @entity159 offered @entity141 , on behalf of @entity21 , $ 5,000 each for the murders of his @entity21 ' sister @entity16 , his wife @entity38 , and brother - in - law @entity30			1
after using cocaine leading up to the crime , @entity141 told police her was driven to the home by an accomplice named @entity155			2
after a lengthy struggle with @entity16 , @entity141 says he managed to shoot and kill both him and @entity38			0
@entity155 would later confess he ’d been behind the wheel of the getaway car that night but not involved in the actual slayings			0
middleman : @entity159 ( pictured ) will spend the next 46 years in jail for playing go - between and helping @entity21 hire @entity141 to kill @entity21 ' family during most of the trial of @entity21 , @entity159 , @entity177 , and @entity141 , @entity21 maintained his innocence			1
the prosecution had a powerful case without @entity21 ’ confession , but 6 - year - old @entity64 would be forced to take the stand and recount the heinous crimes she witnessed			2
the family had to decide if they wanted to put @entity64 on the stand and pursue the death penalty or allow @entity21 to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison , sparing @entity64			1
they chose to spare the girl and @entity21 agreed to confession on the condition he be allowed to tape a message for his daughter to watch			2
‘ he put together a very short , cold videotape , basically that he would n't be able to see her anymore , ’ @entity38 ’ brother @entity197 told @entity90			2
‘ oddly enough , that , you know , she should be a good girl and stay out of trouble and not to do bad things			0
’ @entity159 and @entity177 will spend the next 46 years behind bars for their cursory roles in the crime			0
@entity141 and @entity209 were convicted and sentenced to life in prison			0
still dangerous ? @entity21 will spend the rest of his life behind bars but family says he receives money from an unknown patron and will stop at nothing to finish them off but surviving family like @entity16 , who was fortunate enough to be out of town on business the night of the crime and lives on in spite of the price tag once on her head , says instead of relief she feels only fear			1
she says her brother regularly receives cash from an unknown associate and prison officials confirm as much but say they are in control of how @entity21 uses the money while in prison			1
‘ i know what @entity101 does when he has access to money , ’ @entity16 said			0
‘ his job is n't done , i think he wants to come after me because i was n't home that night			2
and i think he wants to come after @entity118 and @entity240 because they are now the parents of my niece			0

police followed trail of human teeth to the gruesome crime scene where @entity21 ' wife and brother - in - law were shot , slashed , and left dead in pools of their own blood
@entity101 was arrested four times for violating a restraining order held by his wife before ordering the hit from jail , where he will now spend the rest of his life
' his job is n't done ' : @entity21 ' sister was supposed to die that night and now fears the well - *funded* killer will reach her and his child , even from prison
