by @entity0 published : 15:56 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 15:08 est , 6 march 2014 essay optional			1
no penalties for wrong answers			1
the @entity5 college entrance exam is undergoing sweeping revisions			2
changes in the annual test that millions of students take will also do away with some vocabulary words such as ' prevaricator ' and ' sagacious ' in favor of words more commonly used in school and on the job			1
@entity17 officials said wednesday the update â € ” the first since 2005 â € ” is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward			1
the test should offer ' worthy challenges , not artificial obstacles , ' said @entity17 president @entity29 at an announcement event in @entity31 , @entity32			1
the new sat will continue to test reading , writing and math skills , with an emphasis on analysis			2
scoring will return to a 1,600 - point scale last used in 2004 , with a separate score for the optional essay			0
for the first time , students will have the option of taking the test on computers			1
one of the biggest changes is that the extra penalty for wrong answers , which discouraged guessing , will be eliminated			1
and some vocabulary words will be replaced with words such as " synthesis " and ' empirical ' that are used more widely in classrooms and in work settings			0
@entity29 said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of @entity5 words currently have one recourse : drilling with flashcards			2
he said educators know that flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts , but ' when the @entity5 rolls around they become the royal road			0
students stop reading and start flipping			0
' the essay will be changed in other ways , too			0
it will measure students ' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument , instead of measuring the coherence of the writing but not the quality or accuracy of the reasoning			0
it will be up to school districts and colleges the students apply to as to whether the essay will be required			2
each exam will include a passage drawn from ' founding documents ' such as the @entity95 or from discussions they 've inspired			0
new measurement : essays will no longer be compulsory and wrong answers will not be penalized in the exams instead of testing a wide range of math concepts , the new exam will focus on a few areas , like algebra , deemed most needed for college and life afterward			1
a calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions , instead of on the entire math portion			0
a longstanding criticism of the sat is that students from wealthier households do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes			1
the @entity17 seeks to defuse that by saying it will partner with the nonprofit @entity118 to provide free test preparation materials for the redesigned sat. it also says every income - eligible student who takes the @entity5 will receive four fee waivers to apply for college , which continues an effort the @entity17 has had to assist low - income students			1
these are the first @entity5 upgrades since 2005 when the essay portion was added and analogy questions were removed			1
there have been other notable changes to the test , such as in 1994 when antonym questions were removed and calculators were allowed for the first time			2
the test was first used in 1926			0
the sat was taken last year by 1.7 million students			0
it has historically been more popular on the coasts , while the other popular standardized college entrance exam , the @entity140 , dominated the central @entity142 but the @entity140 overtook the sat in overall use in 2012 , in part because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of the states ' testing regimen			0
last year , the @entity140 said it would begin offering computer - based testing in 2015 .			0

@entity17 *outlined* changes to the examinations today
from 2016 students will be given the option of taking the exam on computer , extra penalties for wrong answers will be removed and the essay portion of the tests will no longer be compulsory
certain words will also be removed from the test in a bid to make it more focused on phrases and expressions *people* use in the working world
the tests were last updated in 2005
