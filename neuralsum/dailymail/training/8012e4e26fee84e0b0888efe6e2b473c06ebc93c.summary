when @entity1 headed to @entity2 for a day out with her partner of ten years , she expected city walks and tourist attractions - not a ring			1

and the moment @entity17 walked off under the guise of needing the toilet and @entity1 , 26 , entered the glass walkway for the romantic surprise has been captured on video			1
@entity17 , who had the proposal planned for months , made an excuse to walk off as they were about to go in the couple ( @entity1 , left , @entity17 , right ) consider @entity28 a very special and romantic place for them @entity1 was then left to enter the glass walkway on her own where she found six canvases covered in photos , quotes and memories of their relationship with tags on which @entity17 had written , ' you are and always will be my everything '			1
one was emblazoned with pictures of the couple as children , another included pictures and memories of their first date and an @entity50 holiday , ending with @entity17 's message : ' wherever we went we were happy because we were together			1
' when she reached the end , a chorus of @entity57 singers came out and sang her favourite song when @entity17 walked out with a rose to propose			2
the pair then clutched each other and swayed in a tearful embrace as the singers serenaded them			2
@entity17 said : ' i first had the idea that i wanted to propose in 2013			0

' @entity1 means the world to me			1
we have two children and have been together for 10 years			0
she always puts all of us first and i wanted a day that was just about her to show her just how much she is loved			0
@entity1 was then left to enter the glass walkway on her own , and she was overwhelmed the mother - of - two never expected anything like this - although she knew if @entity17 proposed it would be special @entity17 says he will never forget the day he became the first man to propose on @entity28 's new walkway finally @entity17 got down on one knee to pop the question as @entity1 sobbed with emotion			1
