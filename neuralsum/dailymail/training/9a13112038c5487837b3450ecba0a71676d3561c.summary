if @entity1 is little more than a shop window these days , then perhaps someone should consider cleaning the glass			2
it ’s hard to imagine anyone being overly impressed by a trip to watch @entity8 ’s side right now			2
this was just a typical day in the recent life of this stumbling club – it started with @entity13 being sold and @entity14 released ; it ended with a limp defeat			2
they have won two games in 10 in all competitions and a mediocre @entity21 campaign is all they have left to cling to after this cup exit			2
@entity24 scored the winner for @entity26 against @entity1 two minutes from time @entity29 's second - half free - kick got @entity26 back on level terms the 23 - year - old celebrates after drawing the @entity26 level at the @entity31 @entity32 rises highest to thump home a header from close range to give @entity1 the lead in the first half @entity1 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 ( @entity42 43 ) , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 85 ) , @entity48 , @entity32 , @entity49 ( @entity50 71			1
) subs not used : @entity52 , @entity13 , @entity53 , @entity54			2
goal : @entity32 25 @entity26 : @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 35 ) @entity56 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 89 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity24 82 ) , @entity68			1
subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73			2
goals : @entity63 64 , @entity24 87 referee : @entity76 attendance : 11,750 the greater priority at the moment , it seems , is slashing the wage bill by replacing the players of their past two managers with cheaper , lesser lights			1
@entity8 summed it up by saying last week : ‘ we are not shopping in @entity88 anymore			2
’ after watching @entity29 and @entity24 striker in the second half to cancel out @entity32 ’s opener , supporters started to leave			1
it is telling that @entity8 admitted he wanted to joined them			0
he said : ‘ it was probably the most disappointing 45 minutes since i have been here			0
we have had an honest and frank conversation after the game			0
‘ i would have probably walked out myself if i was in the crowd in that second period			0
there will be ups and downs in terms of making progress but this is a bad day for us			0
it is important for us to unite , be strong and respond to the criticism			0
’ @entity32 ( right ) celebrates with strike partner @entity49 after putting the @entity111 ahead on saturday @entity40 ( left ) holds off a challenge from former @entity1 and now @entity26 defender @entity58 ( right ) for @entity26 manager @entity114 , a cup winner as a player and coach at @entity118 , this was an altogether more enjoyable trip to @entity1 than last season , when a 1 - 0 defeat cost him his @entity122 job			1
he said : ‘ it feels better this time			0
we tweaked the mentality at half - time went on the front foot and deserved to win			1
‘ we just had a quiet chat to put one or two things right			0
we reminded them of their responsibilities when they cross the line and play for those fans			0
’ @entity114 made only two changes to the side that lost against @entity138 in the @entity21 , but even with a strong side they barely made a dent in the first half			1
@entity29 curled over after 11 minutes and @entity62 cut in from the right moments later before hitting a bouncing shot straight at @entity38			1
neither moment was particularly threatening			0
having gone from functional under @entity147 to attacking under @entity148 , they are back where they started , just not nearly so effective			0
certainly , the transitions and overhauls have been costly in a number of senses			0
@entity1 boss @entity8 looks on from the touchline before his side 's @entity157 home tie against @entity26 @entity8 's counterpart @entity26 boss @entity114 always watches on prior to kick - off the momentum for this club seems distinctly negative , though they at least had a lead to shout about in this fixture			1
as has so often been the case , it was @entity32 , the club ’s biggest earner but also their leading threat , who did the damage			1
@entity44 hooked in a corner from the left and the @entity175 ’s header was excellent			1
he has six goals in eight games and 12 for the season – the club ’s fortunes would be bleaker if he , too , is erased from the balance sheet			0
but a single cog can only do so much			0
@entity1 had a man less in midfield and the pressure built until @entity29 levelled in the 64th minute with a free - kick			1
@entity24 came off the bench and immediately forced a good save before he flicked the winner two minutes from time			1
@entity26 ’s upward curve under @entity114 continued ; a strange season for @entity1 just got a little bit worse .			1

@entity24 *completes* @entity26 comeback with 88th minute winner
@entity29 had earlier cancelled out @entity32 ' first - half header
*royals* advance through to @entity157 fifth round
