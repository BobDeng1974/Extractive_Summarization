@entity44 is a group of conditions that can cause sudden death in adults			2
they are caused by an abnormality of the rhythms of the heart			0
in about one in five cases of sudden cardiac death in young people , no definite cause of death can be found			1
this applies even once drugs have been excluded as a cause and a pathologist has examined the heart for structural abnormalities			0
these deaths are attributed to @entity12			0
it occurs when a cardiac arrest is brought on by a problem with the electrical functioning of the heart , even though the person has no disease affecting the heart			0
the alarm was raised when work colleagues could not get hold her on may 16 and sergeant major @entity72 and lieutenant @entity73 went to her house and broke in			0
in a statement , mr @entity72 said the pair searched the house calling ms @entity5 ’s name before they went upstairs and into a bedroom where he saw a ruffled duvet and said he smelt the smell of death			1
' i could @entity5 on the bed , ' he explained			2
' she looked to be sleeping , her eyes were closed and she seemed peaceful			0
she was cold to the touch			0
' mr @entity72 noticed some skin discolouration and riger mortis and could not find a pulse and told his officer : ' do not come in			0
you do not need to see this			0
' he then said he covered ms @entity5 with her duvet and said : ' rest , @entity5 ' and 999 was called			2

the baby and its placenta were also completely normal with no signs of problems or infection , the hearing was told			2
' i could not find a cause for @entity5 ’s sudden death having examined all her organs and having examined the baby and the placenta , ' he explained			1
' we do not know really what she died of but the most likely cause is a sudden cardiac death and the reason for that is that we ruled out any other cause of her death			1
' although her heart looked normal that does not rule out problems with the electric conduction of the heart that can cause death			1
@entity44 is a group of conditions that can cause sudden death in adults			2
they are caused by an abnormality of the rhythms of the heart ' and the fact that the lungs had fluid in them shows that the final process is the heart stopping			0

they are caused by an abnormality of the rhythms of the heart			0
' the expert said that this can be hereditary or acquired , but medicine can not be precise how and when the condition will strike			0

the family of ms @entity5 and mr @entity29 released a statement after the hearing which said : ' the sudden death of @entity5 has devastated us			1
“ she was a loving caring , intelligent and beautiful young woman who was looking forward to the birth of her baby girl in a few weeks ’ time			0
' recording a verdict of death by natural causes caused by sudden unexpected maternal / adult death , @entity9 coroner @entity167 said : ' it ’s a clearly very sad death of an apparently fit and healthy woman in the last stages of a pregnancy which makes the loss even harder because her daughter died in utero at the same time			1
' he explained that no underlying condition or problem had been found and added to mr @entity29 and ms @entity5 ’s mother and family : ' i realise that this is not altogether satisfactory but i have to accept that , within the limitations of medical knowledge at this time , it ’s not always possible to be absolutely specific			2
