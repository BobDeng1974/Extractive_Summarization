a @entity1 holidaymaker racked up a staggering £ 20,000 mobile phone bill after she used her internet to upload holiday snaps to @entity5			1
shocked @entity6 , 40 , was landed with the massive bill , which is 28 times the amount she paid for her holiday , when she decided to share photos of her trip to @entity12 on the social network			2
but by using her @entity15 mobile internet to upload the pictures , she ran up data roaming charges which worked out at huge £ 2,700 per day			1
shocked : @entity6 , above , was enjoying a week away with pals when she ran up the bill @entity6 , of @entity21 , @entity22 , had planned for her trip by buying £ 6 per day ' travel saver ' mobile internet bundle from her network provider			1
but @entity15 said that by buying into the deal , she had opted out of the cap on her normal tariff , which limits internet charges to £ 42 per day			1
upon her return , the mother - of - two was faced with monthly repayments of £ 3,000			2
speaking to @entity34 , she said : " i just thought it might be nice to put a few pictures on @entity5			1
i did n't have a clue what on earth had gone on			0
" i thought it was a wind - up			0
the whole holiday only cost me £ 700			2
it 's scare tactics - people do n't realise what these companies are doing			2
" after a national newspaper contacted @entity15 , they agreed to cut the bill from £ 19,656 to £ 875 because of ' exceptional circumstances ' a spokesperson for @entity15 said : " the customer used much more data than her chosen bundle			1
due to the exceptional circumstances we have offered a significant reduction			0
" fearing pressure from @entity60 , @entity6 who earns £ 10,000 per year as an accounts manager , said she plans to fight the revised bill in court			1
stung : the bill was more than 28 times the amount that @entity6 paid for her holiday			2
she plans to appeal in court the row comes with the @entity68 hoping to scrap data roaming charges across @entity71 completely by 2016			1
under current plans , companies will be banned from charging extra for incoming calls to people who are abroad from july 2014			0
that is the first stage in a move to abandon all other roaming charges by 2016			1
if the new rules come into force , mobile providers will either have to charge customers the same prices for phone calls across the @entity85 , or allow them to switch providers for the period they are abroad , without changing their sim card			1
currently , the mobile network three have taken the biggest step toward scrapping data roaming after they announced a tariff which allows users to browse the internet in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 for the same price as on their @entity1 plan			0
other networks offer bundles , which allow a set amount of data usage for a small fee which is then added to the customer 's monthly bill			2
@entity15 , @entity112 and @entity113 all offer packages allowing between 15 and 30 megabytes of data for around two to three pounds per day			2
rather than charge for a specific amount of usage , @entity117 's @entity116 tariff charges a customer £ 3 per day to use the internet at their @entity1 price plan whilst abroad in @entity71			1
networks are fighting the @entity126 legislation , insisting that a ban on data roaming charges will cost the industry £ 6billion per year			1
top tips : avoid running up huge phone bills abroad currently , holiday makers are advised to take precautions to avoid bumper bills , such as turning off data roaming and using free wi - fi			0
smartphones will automatically start to update data when they connect to another network on holiday but step - by - step instructions for how to turn off roaming on a range of popular handsets can be found at @entity144			0
users can connect to the internet at local wi - fi hotspots – often for free – while data roaming on their phone is still switched off or try the ‘ old - school ’ trick of visiting an internet cafe			0
experts recommend buying a booster , which works like an add - on for an existing price plan or package			0
it boosts the amount of calls , texts and data you can use when not in the @entity1			0
mobile networks offer a range of add - on packages for travellers who want to continue using the internet on holiday			0
they all have bundles for within @entity71 , starting at £ 1 a day for 20 megabytes ( 20mb ) of internet use with @entity15 , enough for an hour of @entity5 , according to @entity171			1
but those heading further afield could find they have less choice			0
@entity117 ’s @entity176 costs £ 5 a day for a 25mb daily allowance so holiday makers only pay on the days they use the internet			2
@entity15 ’s @entity182 add - ons start at £ 6 a day for 30mb each day but it costs £ 8 per mb if users go over their allowance			1
@entity113 charges £ 10 per @entity185 outside the @entity85 , although this rises to £ 75 for the same deal , depending on the country visited			1
some people recommend buying a local sim card to use when on holiday			0
however , this will only work for ‘ unlocked ’ phones and will give holidaymakers a new contact number			0
companies such as 0044 or @entity197 allow consumers to buy foreign sim cards before they go away			0
to avoid shock bills , experts recommend trying to download films , maps or music before departure			0
when it comes to calls , the @entity206 has vowed landline calls anywhere in @entity71 will cost the same as ringing friends at home , while mobile calls will be capped at 16p a minute , but there are no plans to prevent high charges for holiday makers venturing further afield			1
the proposals outlined by the @entity206 would ' abolish premiums ' within the 28 member states , meaning dialling relatives abroad would cost the same as a long - distance , domestic call			2
however , @entity224 has become the first @entity1 mobile operator to allow holidaymakers to text and call the @entity1 , as well as go online as part of their current mobile phone contracts			0
the company launched its ‘ @entity231 scheme , ’ which lets three customers use their phones in the republic of @entity101 , @entity96 , @entity100 , @entity97 , @entity99 , @entity102 and @entity98 without being billed for extra international roaming charges			1
it is hoped the move will spark a war among mobile phone network providers to let people use their phones abroad without worrying about the consequences .			0

@entity243 is more than *double* holidaymaker 's entire annual salary
she ran up the charges by uploading ' a few ' pictures to @entity5
@entity15 have slashed the bill but insist she must still pay £ 875
she plans to fight the charges in court
row comes as @entity206 plans to scrap @entity85 roaming charges
