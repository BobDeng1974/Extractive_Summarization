exclusive by @entity1 armed thug : @entity3 has been on the run for almost three years			1
he was serving life for wounding with intent , drugs and firearms offences a rapist , arsonist , two burglars , a gun criminal and a string of robbers feature on a list of on - the - run convicts that government officials tried to keep secret			1
the @entity20 can reveal the fugitives ’ identities after justice secretary @entity23 intervened to end the ‘ nonsense ’ of their privacy being protected			1
he said : ‘ they are wanted men and should be treated as such			2
’ a row erupted last week after officials at the @entity29 refused to release the names of 18 criminals who went on the run between may 2010 and march 2013			1
this newspaper had applied for the names to be released under @entity35 – pointing out that it could help to track them down			1
but officials said there was a blanket ban on releasing the criminals ’ identities because it was their own ‘ personal data ’ and it would be ‘ unfair ’ to them			1
the decision was taken without the knowledge of mr @entity23 who has now overruled the civil servants			1
of the original 18 names , he has published 13			1
they include rapist @entity49 , arsonist @entity50 , burglars @entity52 and @entity54 and robbers @entity55 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
also at large are @entity3 who was serving life for wounding with intent , drugs and firearms offences , @entity63 who was given almost seven years for wounding with intent , and @entity66 , a carer who stole £ 10,000 from a frail , elderly man			2
the other three are fraudster @entity69 , drink driver @entity70 and drug dealer @entity71			2
seven of the inmates walked out of @entity74 open prison in @entity75			2
wounding with intent : @entity63 escaped from his almost seven year sentence two years ago stole £ 10,000 : carer @entity66 was held in an open prison after he stole stole from a pensioner of the five names being withheld , two have been recaptured and face criminal charges , while police have asked for three more to remain classified on ‘ operational ’ grounds			1
the @entity20 submitted the @entity85 request three weeks ago after @entity86 absconded while on temporary release from an open prison			1
since then , there have been a string of other incidents of inmates absconding from open conditions , including murderer @entity94			2
@entity95 , like @entity86 , has been recaptured			2
over the weekend , details emerged about four more inmates who had absconded			0
@entity98 , @entity99 , 22 , who went on the run in april , is wanted after a woman was attacked at a holiday park in @entity103 last week			0
not secure : seven of the on - the - run inmates walked out of @entity74 open prison in @entity75 police have been prepared to release details in the immediate aftermath of an inmate disappearing			0
but the @entity29 would not release a comprehensive list			0
' they are wanted men , and should be treated as such ' : justice secretary @entity23 announced that names of on - the - run prisoners will be released mr @entity23 said that would now change			1
he told the @entity20 : ‘ prisoners on the run from open prisons have been in the news too often of late			1
‘ open prisons are used to prepare those coming to the end of very long sentences for reintegration into society			0
without them all the expert advice is that more people would reoffend after release			0
the number absconding from open prisons is a small fraction of what it was ten years ago under @entity132			0
they ’ve conveniently forgotten how bad things were when they were in office			0
‘ but we take any abscond very seriously , reporting it to the police immediately			0
the police catch most of them quickly			0
even so , i think the rules in open prisons have been too lax , and i am tightening them			0
‘ there ’ll be more stringent risk assessments , tighter rules about what people are allowed to do , and anyone who absconds will get a longer sentence and will be banned from going back to an open prison			0
‘ from the end of this year , we ’ll use gps tags to monitor where they are			0
and there ’ll be no nonsense about data protection laws when it comes to prisoners on the run			1
‘ they are wanted men , and should be treated as such			0
that ’s why on my watch we will not hold back their names , unless the police ask us not to for operational reasons			1

justice secretary intervenes after @entity20 *'s* @entity35
officials had said there was a blanket ban on releasing names of fugitives
names were their own ' personal data ' and it would be ' unfair ' , they said
now @entity23 has overruled the civil servants ' decision
