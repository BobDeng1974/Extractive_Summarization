by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 16:03 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 16:47 est , 18 march 2013 prosecutors have opened the murder trial of a @entity6 abortion provider by telling jurors he routinely forced women who came to him into labor and then killed their babies			1
dr. @entity12 faces the death penalty if convicted of first - degree murder in the deaths of seven infants allegedly born alive at his clinic			1
authorities say he would sever their spines with scissors			0
a pregnant refugee , @entity23 , also died after being given too much anesthesia and pain medication during a 2009 abortion at his @entity6 clinic			1
assistant district attorney @entity28 said that evidence would show that @entity12 , 72 , was a ' wolf in sheep 's clothing ' who ' used and abused desperate women '			1
charged : dr. @entity12 , a @entity6 abortion doctor , is accused of killing seven babies that were born alive			1
the opening statements in his trial began on monday she said he preyed on vulnerable women who were often seeking abortions later than the 24th week , after which abortions are illegal in @entity44			0
' the standard practice here was to slay babies , ' @entity28 said			0
' this is not a case about abortion ... this is a case about murder			0
' @entity28 says the unlicensed , untrained employees who helped carry out the gruesome procedures were equally desperate because they needed work			0
she says investigators found $ 250,000 in cash at @entity12 's home in 2010 , proof of the money he made from the abortion and pain clinic			1
but in his own statements , @entity12 's lawyer , @entity63 , accused officials of ' an elitist , racist prosecution ' against his black client			1
death : @entity69 , pictured with her husband , died at dr @entity12 's clinic in 2009 ' this is a targeted , elitist and racist prosecution of a doctor who ’s done nothing but give ( back ) to the poor and the people of @entity6 , ' @entity63 said			1
' it ’s a prosecutorial lynching of dr. @entity12			1
' @entity12 has pleaded not guilty			2
eight clinic workers charged with him have pleaded guilty , including his wife , a beautician accused of helping him perform stealth third - term abortions on sundays			2
@entity12 set out to offer women safe , legal abortions in the 1970s , but that 's far from what drug investigators say they found inside his @entity6 clinic in 2010			1
by then , @entity12 had gone years without health department inspections , perhaps because state officials preferred a hands - off approach to a political misstep in the abortion quagmire			2
victims : @entity12 is accused of killing @entity94 , the daughter of @entity95 ( pictured ) , after a botched abortion the result , according to a grand jury report , is that @entity12 's patients received the equivalent of the back - alley abortions that advocates of legalized abortion had hoped to eradicate			1
the devastating 2011 grand jury report describes nearly unfathomable conditions : fetal body parts stored in glass jars and staff refrigerators ; filthy , blood - stained operating areas ; women and teens maimed after @entity12 perforated a uterus or colon			2
' anybody walking into that clinic should have known immediately that it should have been shut down , ' said @entity117 , a lawyer for the family of @entity23			2
@entity6 prosecutors accuse state and local authorities of turning a blind eye to laws requiring regular inspections			2
and they say the occasional complaints that trickled in , one after an earlier patient death , went nowhere			0
house of horrors : a grand jury image shows what police claim are bags of body parts at the practice the case drew national attention and prompted state lawmakers to tighten clinic regulations			0
@entity44 abortion clinics now have to meet the same standards of care required by ambulatory surgical facilities , and other states are also adopting that rule			0
@entity145 and other providers complain that the cost of updating facilities to meet ambulatory clinic rules can be prohibitive and further restricts women 's access to abortions			0
@entity44 already required parental or judicial consent for minors , a 24 - hour waiting period and a ban on abortions after 24 weeks gestation			0
@entity69 had fled @entity159 and spent 19 years in refugee camps , some in @entity162 , before arriving in the @entity163 in 2008 with her husband and three children			0
' filthy ' : investigators say @entity12 's clinic , the @entity167 , catered to minorities , immigrants and poor women			1
it was also allegedly the site of unimaginable filth scene : a police car is seen outside the the @entity167 in 2011 following @entity12 's arrest when she discovered she was pregnant , she went to a clinic in @entity178 , where she lived , but was referred to @entity12 because she was in her second trimester			1
she was 19 weeks pregnant when her adult daughter brought her to @entity12 's women 's @entity181			1
the thin , 4 - foot - @entity183 , who spoke no @entity184 , was allegedly given a lethal dose of @entity186 and other drugs before @entity12 , the only licensed doctor on staff , ever arrived			0
@entity12 earned kudos by returning to the area after medical school , when he could have set up shop in the suburbs			0
he worked out of a storefront he bought in the run - down @entity196 section			0
but @entity12 came to operate under the radar , relying on unlicensed medical school graduates , untrained clerical staff and even a teen working after school to administer anesthesia and help perform abortions , usually on poor and immigrant women paying a few hundred dollars in cash			2
