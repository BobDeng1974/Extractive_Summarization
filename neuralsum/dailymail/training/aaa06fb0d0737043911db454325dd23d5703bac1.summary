by @entity0 published : 20:22 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 20:22 est , 30 november 2013 one of @entity4 ’s top barristers will tomorrow demand the release of court papers from the trial of @entity8 , the high - society fixer at the centre of the @entity12 sex scandal , claiming there has been a cover - up			1
@entity15 will publicly criticise the @entity16 for what he claims is its refusal to release the transcripts of the trial which took place 50 years ago			1
such transcripts are routinely made available to the public and mr @entity24 last night said he was not aware of another case where relevant papers had not been disclosed			2
@entity8 with @entity27 ( bottom left ) @entity29 and @entity30 ( right ) he said : ‘ @entity32 trial is the only trial in @entity4 legal history in which papers are being withheld			1
' this is the most idiotic secrecy which has meant that the cover - up in relation to @entity8 continues to this day			1
’ @entity38 dr @entity8 who was involved in the 1963 @entity12 affair mr @entity24 added : ‘ they have refused me access on an entirely bogus claim that the disclosure of the documents would contrary to the @entity43			1
once a trial is heard in open court , the open justice principle requires transcripts relating to that trial to be public			2
’ mr @entity24 has carried out his own review of the @entity8 trial after a lifetime ’s fascination with the case			1
tomorrow he will publish his findings in a 190 - page report which is expected to cast serious doubt on @entity8 ’s 1963 conviction for living off immoral earnings			1
it could lead to renewed pressure that the conviction should be overturned			0
the @entity12 scandal was sparked by the revelation that war minister @entity66 had an affair with @entity27 , a showgirl who was also in a relationship with a @entity70 naval attache			0
@entity8 , a successful osteopath and society portrait painter , had introduced the pair at a party in 1961			1
@entity8 was subsequently charged with living off the immoral earnings of @entity27 and her friend @entity76 , and with a separate charge of procuring prostitutes			1
he took a fatal overdose before his trial at the @entity81 ended and was still in a coma when he was found guilty of the first charge but cleared of the second			1
he died three days later on august 3 , 1963			0
@entity66 , in his time as the secretary of state for war before the scandal @entity88 wanted to give a knighthood to @entity66 but his plan was blocked by civil servants			0
mr @entity88 believed that @entity66 – forced to quit as minister of war in 1963 over his scandalous affair with @entity27 – deserved the honour because he worked tirelessly to restore his public reputation			0
documents obtained by this newspaper under freedom of information laws show that mr @entity88 was considering a knighthood for the former @entity101 mp in the @entity102 of 2000 in recognition of @entity66 ’s work for charity , including the @entity107 homeless project in @entity108			0
but the documents also show that civil servants were adamant that @entity66 did not deserve the award			0
one official wrote : ‘ @entity107 is not the most active or stimulating organisation			0
as a training provider it is very poor			0
we do not support a further honour			0
’ @entity66 , who had already been awarded a cbe in 1975 , died in 2006 aged 91			0
the decision to prosecute @entity8 , who is the subject of a new musical by @entity120 , remains highly contentious			2
sources close to mr @entity24 ’s investigation – first revealed by this newspaper in september – say it will argue that either the conviction should be quashed or that @entity8 should be granted a royal pardon			2
@entity88 thought that @entity66 had worked hard to rebuild his reputation after the 1963 scandal mr @entity24 declined to reveal his full conclusions , but added : ‘ i do analyse certain issues including whether the women were prostitutes at all , whether @entity8 lived off them or whether they , in fact , lived off him , and whether the judge behaved correctly in allowing the jury to convict on the evidence that was presented			1
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity16 said none of the six files relating to the @entity8 case was described as a ‘ transcript ’			2
but she confirmed that one file which contained allegations of prostitution and details of the sex lives of named individuals was closed until 2046 .			0

it is thought that ' covered - up ' papers could clear @entity38 @entity8
the society fixer took a fatal overdose during his trial in 1963
@entity15 will publicly criticise the @entity155
