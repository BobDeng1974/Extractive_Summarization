@entity6 , 28 , had feared she would never have another child after suffering a rare cancer of the adrenal gland			1
but to her total surprise , she discovered she was pregnant after months of gruelling surgery and chemotherapy - only for baby @entity13 to be diagnosed with meningitis when he was just three weeks old			1
@entity6 , 28 , had feared she would never have another child after suffering a rare cancer of the adrenal gland			1
but shortly after finishing gruelling chemotherapy , she discovered she was expecting baby @entity13 doctors discovered the tennis - ball sized tumour on top of mrs @entity6 's kidney in august 2011 when looking for a cause for her continual weight gain			1
the tumour was causing her to overproduce testosterone - making her pile on the pounds - and stopping her from getting pregnant			0
it was removed a month later , and she endured three months of daily chemotherapy before doctors found a second tumour , removed in may			0
shortly after that , and to her total surprise , she discovered she was expecting			0
mrs @entity6 , from @entity31 , said : ' i really thought that my body was just ruined by all i had been through			2
' i had to have fertility treatment before for my daughter , so with all the chemo , operations , and scarring on top of that , i thought i would never get pregnant - not in a million years			2
@entity13 arrived on september 14 , weighing a healthy 6lb 1oz			1
but just three weeks later , he was rushed to hospital with a high temperature and diagnosed with meningitis ' when i found out it was a big shock - you forget all the cancer			1
' i do believe things happen for a reason and that really this was meant to be			0
' @entity13 arrived on september 14 , weighing a healthy 6lb 1oz			1
but just three weeks after he was born , he was rushed to hospital with a high temperature			0
doctors warned mrs @entity6 and her husband @entity53 , 28 , that @entity13 most likely had potentially fatal meningitis - which was later confirmed by a lumbar puncture			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' it was petrifying			2
when they first did all the tests i did n’t want to believe what was happening to my baby			0
mother and son are both well again , although mrs @entity6 must have regular check - ups ' we were sleeping at the hospital for four nights and i would rather have taken his place			2
' they were telling us to prepare for things like brain damage			0
he was so tiny and wired up			0
luckily it was viral , so he could fight it on his own and pulled through and he ’s fine now , gaining weight and really healthy			0
' mrs @entity6 is now cancer free , but has to return to hospital every three months for check ups			2
she added : ' it is just all about waiting but for now i ’m looking forward to a different @entity81 with @entity13 and the rest of the family			0
