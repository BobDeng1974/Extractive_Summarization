by @entity0 for @entity1 for centuries , dogs have been man 's best friend , whether it was for companionship , hunting or protection			0
and now 21st century pets are being used to help humans with difficult illnesses to lead a more normal life			0
@entity14 , eight , from @entity15 , struggles with a severe form of autism that makes it difficult to communicate or express feelings in a way that is understood by others			1
@entity14 and his dog @entity22 , who transformed his life			1
until she arrived , the eight - year - old struggled to communicate with other humans			0
a severe case of autism left him often isolated from others			2
it that meant for many years , he rarely even smiled and had no friends			1
even a trip to the local shops could result in terrible distress , because every aspect of @entity14 's life needed to be regimented in order for him to be comfortable			2
it meant that as the years passed , he led an increasingly lonely and isolated life as contact with new people occurred less frequently			0
his mum @entity46 was heartbroken at having to watch her child become so sad and it seemed like there was little they could do to change the situation			0
she said : ' @entity14 was a very lonely little boy who had no friends , it was horrible to see how isolated and lonely he was			1
' for the family , it was difficult because everyday life would cause him great distress - even going to the shops			0
this meant my life had to be regimented to reduce this stress as much as possible			0
' but everything changed in 2013 , when @entity46 got in contact with the charity support dogs			0
through its @entity67 , they found a @entity69 called @entity70 , nicknamed @entity22 , who would become the new family pet			1
@entity14 rarely used to even smile , but since @entity22 arrived from @entity65 on the @entity67 , the transformation in his personality has been dramatic			1
in just a short while , the transformation to the whole @entity46 family was vast			0
@entity46 said : ' when @entity22 entered our family , our lives were changed and the change in @entity14 was phenomenal			1
' firstly , there was the difference she made in everyday life			0
' now when we need to go to the shops or want to go on a family day out we tell @entity14 that @entity22 wants to go and he does n’t become stressed			1
before @entity22 the dog arrived , a simple trip to the shops with his mum @entity46 ( pictured ) could cause huge distress to @entity14			1
but now he 's so confident that he 's even happy to talk to strangers who ask about his pet ' even when @entity22 is not around , knowing she is close by keeps @entity14 happy and calm			1
' but the biggest plus to having @entity22 around is the change in @entity14			1
@entity46 said : ' before when we went out in public , @entity14 would want to be invisible			2
' he would become very distressed if people wanted to talk to him , but now the difference is incredible			0
' if people stop to talk to him about @entity22 , he will happily stand and talk to strangers because he ’s proud of her			2
' i ca n’t put into words how incredible this is to watch - to go from wanting to be invisible to growing in confidence in everyday and wanting the world to see you			0
it ’s amazing ! ' @entity110 and @entity14 are now best friends , with @entity14 's mum crediting the dog with being the best medicine in the world			1
autism assistance dogs are specially trained to help a child become more independent and sociable in a safe way			2
in special cases like @entity14 's dogs are the only way of providing comfort to a child			2
@entity46 said : ' every @entity14 needs a @entity22 - they are best friends			1
' if @entity14 is sick or sad , she is there , without being told to do this			2
he loves her and she loves him			0
@entity22 is the best medicine			0
' @entity14 and @entity22 have been part of the @entity130 campaign , celebrating the nation ’s most treasured pets .			1

@entity14 , eight , has severe form of autism , so he struggles to communicate
until pet dog @entity22 came along , he had no friends and rarely even smiled
thanks to @entity22 , @entity14 is now confident child who even talks to strangers
