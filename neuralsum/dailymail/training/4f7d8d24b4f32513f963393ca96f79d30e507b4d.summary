@entity2 's @entity1 screening plans remained in chaos yesterday as airports said they had been given no instructions			1
after days of @entity8 indecision over whether to screen airline passengers to halt the spread of the deadly virus , @entity6 was yesterday still unable to say when the process would start or where it would find the medics to oversee it			1
with the incubation period for the disease as long as 21 days , it was feared the delay in introducing measures could mean the deadly virus is already in the @entity2			0
last night airports , airlines and @entity38 all said they were still waiting for instructions			2
@entity40 said it knew nothing about the new measures , with an airport spokesman adding : ‘ we ’ve not had anything at all			2
we ’re still waiting for @entity47			0
’ @entity47 , the government body which had previously said screening would not be effective , is now in charge of the programme but said it had no more details of how it would work			2
new problems : further questions have been raised about @entity8 plans to introduce enhanced screening for @entity1 at major airports and terminals , after @entity40 , pictured , said it knew nothing about the measures @entity62 mp @entity61 said the lack of precise information was ‘ shambolic ’ and critics called the proposed questionnaires ‘ a complete waste of time ’			1
@entity69 said the government was ‘ taking all the steps we can ’ to keep @entity2 safe from @entity1 but experts said the continued spread of the disease meant it was likely to arrive in this country soon			0
the @entity76 warned the number of cases is doubling every four weeks , with more than 4,000 people now dead in the worst ever outbreak of the virus			0
@entity6 said screening will be introduced at @entity25 , @entity40 and the @entity38 terminal for passengers from @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 in @entity30 – the three nations at the centre of the outbreak			1
taking aim : a thermal scanner is used to test the temperature of a passenger at a @entity96 airport yesterday , but @entity2 officials will only ask people if they feel unwell in the first instance they will be given a questionnaire about their potential exposure to @entity1 and their health			1
those assessed to pose a risk will have their temperature checked to test for a fever			0
defence : @entity69 , pictured today , said the government is ' taking all the steps we can ' to prevent an @entity1 outbreak in the @entity2 any with a high temperature will be isolated while they undergo further tests			1
but critics said a sufferer could show no symptoms on arrival in @entity2 but still fall ill days later			0
others said travellers would lie on questionnaires to avoid delays			0
@entity124 , professor of communicable diseases at the @entity126 , said the proposed screening was ‘ a complete waste of time ’			0
he said : ‘ why would anyone admit they have been in contact with someone when they ’re in a hurry to get through immigration control ? ’ asked if he believed @entity1 would reach @entity2 , he said : ‘ i think it ’s bound to happen			2
’ passengers arriving at @entity25 from @entity139 said their temperatures were taken in @entity141 before they boarded , but there were no checks on arrival in @entity2 – or any warnings about symptoms or where to seek help if they fell ill. new rules : passengers arrive for a @entity38 service at @entity151 but the company has admitted it is still not sure how it will work ministers were accused of a chaotic response to the @entity1 crisis last night after it emerged new screening measures at @entity2 airports amounted to little more than a questionnaire @entity161 police guard the entrance of a quarantined hotel in @entity164			1
a @entity2 man staying there has died of @entity1 and his travelling companion has showed symptoms of the disease health workers in @entity164 , @entity161 , outside the hospital where the @entity2 man died of what is believed to be @entity1 .			1

@entity6 orders screening at @entity25 and @entity40 and on @entity38
but passengers will only be asked a basic questionnaire about their health
@entity40 admits they *'ve* ' had nothing at all ' about how to screen passengers
@entity38 also says its staff does not know how the process will work
in @entity32 border staff are carrying out temperature screening
@entity189 who died in @entity164 , @entity161 , may have contracted @entity1
the *epidemic* has killed *3,800* and *infected* at least *8,000* so far
