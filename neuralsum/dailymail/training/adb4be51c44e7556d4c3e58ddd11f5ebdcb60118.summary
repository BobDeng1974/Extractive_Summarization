the father of the @entity2 tourist , who is on the run after a young @entity5 woman was found brutally murdered , has begged his son to turn himself in to police			1
the naked body of the 20 - year - old was found with her throat cut , hidden under a bed at the £ 12 - a - night @entity12 in the capital @entity14			1
police said they were searching for @entity16 , who is believed to still be in the country			1
murder : the woman was found at the @entity12 in @entity21 district , @entity5 his 69 - year - old father @entity22 , of @entity24 , @entity25 , said today that his son was a loner and did have a temper			1
he told @entity27 : ‘ if i could speak to him i would say , “ @entity16 , hand yourself in immediately , ” but i ’m not confident about the state he ’ll be in			1
’ the man had heard from his 47 - year - old son a few weeks ago when he called and said he had met a woman			2
she spoke briefly to @entity22 and he was glad to hear his son was happy			1
he said : ‘ he has a temper but he normally would n’t hurt anybody , particularly a woman			2
’ foreigners living in the country said today that @entity16 , from @entity25 , would be hungry and desperate after five days in hiding as the intense police search got under way			1
his photo and passport details have been issued to police posts on main highways , officials at all airports have been placed on alert and hotels and guest houses have been ordered to report him should he try to check in			0
possibly bedraggled and unshaven by now , the bespectacled @entity54 will quickly draw attention to himself if he does try to rent a room			0
room : the naked body of the victim was discovered under the bed in a hotel room it has not been revealed if he took his clothes with him when he left the @entity12 in @entity14 with his passport at 11pm on december 28 - three days after he checked in with the young woman			1
expatriates writing on a local discussion post said it was only a matter of time before @entity16 was arrested and interrogated about the murder of the 20 - year - old woman , whose body , with her throat slashed , was found under a bed in the £ 12 - a - night room			1
@entity16 had urged a receptionist to return his passport - customarily held until the bill was paid - on the night he left because he wanted to go to a bank so he could pay for the room the following morning			2
although no banks would have been open at that hour , he was given his passport and he walked out of the hotel , never to return			2
the woman 's body was found by a cleaner the next day			2
one writer , identified only as @entity87 , stated : ' this guy will be looking over his shoulder every day until he is finally and inevitably caught up with			0
' another wrote that the hotel was a two - minute stroll from @entity93 , a shopping mall , ' which as we all know is ground zero for scuzzy , dissolute foreign men			2
' the woman , who has yet to be formally identified as her body now remains in a @entity101 temple , was described by police as being aged about 20 and a little over 5ft tall			2
she was said by local people to have been seen in the past walking with foreign men beside the @entity105 in @entity14			0
@entity5 : the man had been staying at a restort in the country with the unnamed woman one expatriate wrote on the discussion page that he believed @entity16 had been living in @entity5 for six months , although that would have required obtaining a special visa or applying for an extension of his stay			1
' there is no indication that he has been able to leave the country , ' lieutenant colonel @entity116 , of @entity14 's foreigner police department , said last night			0
‘ we have made checks at all the obvious exit points and there is no listing for him			0
' there is speculation that @entity16 might simply have taken a motor bike ' taxi ' to a remote area and fled into the jungle where he might have found accommodation in a village where the locals would have not heard about the police hunt for him			1
a regular writer on the discussion page wrote : ' i doubt that he left by air			0
‘ that requires spending more money , using the internet , going to a travel agent , possibly having a credit card , going through computerised exit immigration , name being on passenger manifest , etc. murder : police today released details of what they said was a shocking crime ' bus to @entity157 makes more sense			0
or a flophouse a block away			0
' i have no contingency plan for what i would do in this situation			0
' i might bus it to @entity167 and try to blend with the tourists before figuring out my next move			0
' yet another expatriate noted : ' hiding out in @entity5 ? he 'll be found and arrested			1
' hopped the border to @entity172 ? he 'll be found , arrested and extradited			0
' ' hopped the border to @entity174 ? ditto			0
' ' made it back to @entity176 ( unlikely ) ? he 'll be arrested			0
' police sources said that to remain on the run , @entity16 would need cash , food and water , all of which would require him to make contact with people			1
and the more the word spread that he was wanted , the greater the chances of him being apprehended			0
police said that until @entity16 was found , the reasons for the young woman 's murder would remain a mystery - although one expatriate said there was always the remote possibility that she attacked the @entity54 and he defended himself , before making an effort to calmly leave the hotel .			1
