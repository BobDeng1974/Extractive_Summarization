caretaker boss @entity0 fears @entity1 could be run out of the play - offs entirely – after they threw away a late lead against @entity4 to draw 1 - 1			1
on a night when @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 returned to sit in the main stand alongside the new board - following the suspension of their predecessors earlier in the day - the team could n’t match the renewed sense of optimism around @entity15			1
dropping another two points not only means @entity18 can win the @entity20 title before the month is out , it also keeps @entity1 in third place behind @entity22 - with last night ’s visitors only six points adrift			1
@entity0 issues instructions to his layers during the 1 - 1 draw with @entity4 @entity0 says his side must be wary of @entity4 in fourth and @entity29 in fifth asked if he thought that either the @entity31 side or @entity29 could pip his team to the final play - off spot , @entity0 said : ‘ there is every chance			1
they are playing for the play - offs as much as we are			2
so we ca n’t be disrespectful of them			2
‘ @entity4 are a good side , as are @entity29			1
they are looking to win games like we ’re looking to win games			2
we ’ve got to work harder to turn it about			2
‘ i think it ’s going to go right to the wire , the play - off places , without a shadow of a doubt			2
we have to find a formula to get winning again , we are stuttering along			0
‘ we ’re not doing enough in front of goal and obviously not doing well enough to defend our goal			0
it ’s nothing other than hard work until we get back to winning games			0
’ @entity0 , who has won only three of his 10 games in charge since stepping in for @entity58 , said he had n’t yet been told if the new board had accepted the resignation he handed to the previous regime			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity62 , on loan from @entity64 , celebrates putting the home side ahead at @entity15 @entity67 striker @entity66 ( centre ) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller ‘ no - i would expect them to come to me , as opposed me going to them , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ve got games to concentrate on with the team , i ’m here to do that			0
i ’m sure if the board want to keep me they ’ll come and speak to me			0
’ a cool @entity62 finish following a goalmouth scramble with 13 minutes remaining should have been enough to give @entity1 an ill - deserved three points from a bitty performance			1
but @entity4 equalised three minutes from time , 17 - year - old sub @entity66 on the spot – and granted plenty of time - to bury the rebound from a @entity84 shot following a defensive mistake by home sub @entity87			1
the home team left the field to a smattering of boos from the second biggest @entity15 crowd of the season			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it ’s very disappointing , when supporters had come out , the new board is in place and the stadium is full			1
you get the lead and you are hoping to see it out – and do n’t do it through poor , poor defending			0
’ @entity1 legend @entity5 was in the stands at @entity15 for tuesday night 's @entity20 clash @entity62 celebrates hos goal with substitute @entity106 ( left ) , @entity107 and @entity108 queens moved a point clear in the fourth and final play - off spot , although boss @entity112 believed his team could have won , declaring : ‘ it would have been a travesty had we not got anything out of it			1
we were the better team and had the better chances			0
‘ but the boys reacted well after going behind and we are delighted young @entity66 got the goal			0
‘ @entity1 came out fast but we then controlled the game and some of our passing was excellent			1
we are happy with the point but , being greedy , i ’d have liked the three			0
it ’s still going to be difficult to make the play - offs			2
there are a few clubs in there but we will keep going			0
’ @entity129 , making just his second appearance for the club , said : ‘ it ’s the best feeling ever			2
the ball just fell at my feet and i managed to lift it over the keeper			0
i actually thought @entity84 was going to score before i did			0
my dad was in the crowd tonight but i have n’t yet had a chance to speak to him			0
