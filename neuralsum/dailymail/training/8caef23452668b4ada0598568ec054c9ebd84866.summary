crowdsourcing = how to be a bum in 2014			0
' @entity111 is a new phenomenon , but has become one of the fastest ways of making money over the internet			0
it is used by businesses , charities or other ventures to mobilise an army of investors , who often each put in only small sums			0
it can be a way for a people to obatin a share in a company but can also a way for people to donate to a cause anonymously			0
the first major website to take advantage of the new fundraising trend was @entity135			2
set up in 2009 , it allowed people to raise money for individual projects by setting up online accounts			0
for example , musician @entity141 raised £ 700,000 from 24,883 backers in june 2012 to make a new album and art book			2

' if you do not want to donate then you do not have to			0
it is a gesture not a tax			0
' i have had good connections to tap			0
i guess i am surprised that i have raised so much so quickly			0
@entity111 is going to get bigger and bigger			0
she added : ' my parents are not millionaires			0
my mother was a successful musician and she was able to pay off her house , but as she got older is has become harder to get work			2
' i am already so much in my mum 's debt			1
i would rather not do the degree than have my mum pay for it			2
' ' the idea is that you do the masters with me			0
on the private blog i will summarise all the cruxes of what i learn and turn it into easily digestible lay person times			0
' in a blog post in response to hateful comments , miss @entity1 wrote : ' i can not fathom the mindset one would need to possess to translate this frustration into spiteful comments			0
' ' i could possibly take out a bank loan ' like the rest of us ' ( there are no student loans available for masters students ) , but it should be clear for all to see that this solution to my problem would be far inferior to being given a large number of small , voluntary donations from people in exchange for a look - in on my area of academic interest as i study it			1
' so far she has raised £ 14,021 - just over half the cash she needs for tuition fees and living expenses			1
miss @entity1 has a minimum target of £ 14,523 to reach by august 1 , her deadline for accepting the offer , so she can pay her tuition and college fees up front			1
a £ 1 donation gets you access to to her ‘ exclusive master blog ’			1
donors who give £ 500 or more get a professionally bound and signed copy of @entity12 ’s prize - winning dissertation			1
an @entity7 spokesman said : ' fundraising for postgraduate scholarships is one of the @entity7 ’s key priorities and this year over 1,000 fully - funded scholarships were available from the @entity7 , its colleges and supporters for new master ’s and doctoral students in 2014 - 15 , which puts us in a very fortunate position compared to our @entity99 peers			1
' but for the many aspiring graduate students who do not receive scholarships , it can be very difficult to find the money for their studies and we hope that more can be done at a national level to ensure postgraduate study is open to all			0
