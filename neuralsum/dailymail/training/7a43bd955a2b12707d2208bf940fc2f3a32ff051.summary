by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 21 december 2012 updated : 05:18 est , 24 december 2012 @entity1 is always a stressful time for parents			1
so spare a thought for @entity4 , who has just celebrated the birth of her 12th child			1
this year , between the frenzied opening of stockings and presents and preparing a full @entity11 breakfast for 14 as well as lunch with all the trimmings , mrs @entity4 , 38 , will have to make time to feed five - week - old @entity15			1
fortunately , she is an expert at using her time efficiently as she and her husband , @entity17 , 39 , both work full time , rather than relying on the state to bankroll their huge family , and the children are home educated			1
‘ it is a long day but we have a lovely time and the children are happy , which is so rewarding			0
by the time all the younger children are in bed , @entity17 will have a @entity47 , which is his little treat , and i might go for a glass of @entity51			1
but if i am really shattered it might end up being a cup of tea			0
’ the couple ’s oldest child , @entity29 , is 19 , followed by @entity26 , 18 , and @entity30 , 13			1
then there is @entity32 , nine , @entity33 , seven , @entity25 , seven tomorrow , @entity34 , five , @entity35 , three , @entity24 , two , and 14 - month - old twins @entity28 and @entity31			0
@entity15 arrived on november 21			2
the day will begin in the small hours for mrs @entity4 , when she gives @entity59 a couple of bottle feeds			1
at 5am she and her husband will get up to start preparing breakfast , which is kept warm in the oven until the children have opened their stockings			2
cooking the turkey begins at 8am , after which the family ’s first present opening session takes place			0
with 150 - or - so gifts to open , time has to be set aside after lunch to finish the process			2
the smaller children have a nap mid-morning while mum puts the finishing touches to lunch , which is served around 1pm			0
what 's for lunch ? @entity4 and @entity17 will prepare a full @entity11 for the family of 14 on christmas day , before serving up lunch with all the trimmings later on supplies : @entity4 and baby @entity15 with the mountains of food for the @entity4 family @entity1 with the last of the gifts opened and the wrapping paper tidied up by 5pm , a buffet is laid on for the family before they settle down to play games			1
by 6pm , the gruelling round of putting children to bed begins , lasting around 90 minutes			0
mrs @entity4 then has a quick shower to freshen up and collapses on the sofa with a drink at 8pm			2
the family budget for @entity1 is around £ 2,000 – which includes around £ 200 on food and drink			1
gifts this year include an @entity106 , books , cameras , toys and clothes vouchers			0
mr and mrs @entity4 met when they were teenagers and married ten years ago			2
she used to work as a recruitment consultant but runs a website , @entity115 , which gives advice on how to run a large family			0
working from the couple ’s £ 200,000 detached house , near @entity120 in @entity121 , also allows her to home school the children			1
mr @entity124 is self - employed as a part - time joiner and helps out with the website and at home when he is not working			0
when the festive season is over , the family will get back to its usual routine , which involves a £ 200 weekly food shop			0
they are planning a two - month family road trip through @entity134 and @entity135 from april but hope to offset the cost with a book about the adventure			0
so , with each day already packed from end to end , do they plan to settle for a round dozen children ? not necessarily … ‘ having one more will not change our lives massively now , ’ said mrs @entity4 .			2

@entity4 , 38 , and her husband @entity17 , 39 , have just celebrated the birth of their 12th child , @entity15
the @entity121 couple , who now have seven sons and five daughters , set a £ 2,000 budget for @entity1
