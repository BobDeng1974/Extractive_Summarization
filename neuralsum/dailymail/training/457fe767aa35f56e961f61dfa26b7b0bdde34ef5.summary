the @entity0 has banned two men from @entity2 for two months for the alleged homophobic abuse aimed towards @entity5 referee @entity4 during @entity7 's defeat to @entity8 earlier this month			1
both men will also pay £ 1,000 each to a charity of @entity4 ' choosing following an initial @entity0 investigation			1
however , there is a second ongoing investigation into the alleged incident - which took place during the november international at @entity2 on november 8 and came to light in a letter from a spectator published in @entity20			2
referee @entity4 ( left ) is one of only a handful of openly homosexual people in rugby ' as a lifelong rugby fan , a straight man in his 60s , i could not believe that a bunch of men half my age watching a rugby match in the 21st century could be capable of hurling such nasty , foul - mouthed , racist , homophobic abuse at an openly gay match official , ' @entity34 , from @entity35 , wrote in a letter to @entity20 on wednesday			1
' my equally disgusted son is in his 30s but next to him , hearing this vitriol , was a little boy			0
' and @entity4 , speaking on @entity40 , says it 's others the abusers are hurting , not himself			1
' they go to the stadiums , get drunk and think its fine to shout abuse , ' @entity4 said			2
' it 's up to rugby people in the stadium saying ' that 's not acceptable in this sport ' so we can get rid of them from the game			0
' ' i 'd tell them to think twice about saying things , because it 's not me they 're hurting , it 's the young kid sitting in the row in front who 's maybe dealing with their own sexuality			2
' the most difficult thing i ever had to do in my life was accepting i was gay			0
it 's someone sitting two seats away , going through what i went through , dealing with who they are , who are the people they 're putting in danger			0
the @entity5 official is widely considered to be one of the world 's best referees ' i 've been there myself and i know they can tip you over the edge , i had a second chance , let 's make sure that we do n't put other people in that situation - because there 's no need for it in society and no need for it in life			1
' people say that i 've broken down barriers by being a gay man in sport , but the true heroes here are the ones who do n't stand by , who stand up and bring it to the attention of the governing bodies			0
' @entity4 is one of only a handful of homosexual people in rugby and admitted he contemplated suicide before he came out			0
he is also an extremely highly - respected referee and is regarded as one of world 's finest officials			0
two men have been banned from @entity2 for two years for the alleged homophobic abuse in a statement on friday , @entity0 chief executive @entity117 said : ' while instances of this nature are exceptionally rare , the @entity0 takes rugby 's values of teamwork , respect , enjoyment , discipline and sportsmanship very seriously , and is determined to uphold them			1
' we are all guardians of these aspects of the game , on and off the pitch , and it is these values which make the sport special			0
' in addition , the @entity0 has insisted it will endeavour to underline exactly what is expected from supporters at @entity2 - with messaging being inserted into every ticket pack , programme , on led boards and big screens throughout the ground highlighting the behaviour expected			1
