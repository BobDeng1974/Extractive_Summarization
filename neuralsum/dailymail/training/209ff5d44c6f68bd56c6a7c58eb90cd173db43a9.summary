former @entity1 defender @entity0 believes that football as a sport has become complacent in its efforts to deal with racism			1
speaking in response to the shameful incident in @entity8 this week in which @entity10 supporters prevented a black man from boarding a train while chanting : ' we 're racist and that 's the way we like it			2
' speaking on @entity16 : ' i think a lot of people became a bit complacent with racism because we 're not hearing it so much in stadiums in our country people believe we 've done the job			1
former @entity1 defender @entity0 speaking about racism on the ' fletch and @entity31 ' show on @entity16 @entity10 fans were filmed chanting ' we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it ' while on the train ' it 's been simmering , it 's there			1
we thought football was a tool to suppress it ( racism )			1
it 's a good vehicle but the bigger issue is society and education - to get into people 's homes and schools to educate away from this ignorance			1
' the @entity52 @entity51 man , now with @entity53 , wrote on @entity54 on saturday that ' complacency ' has allowed racism to prevail and reiterated those comments in a column for the @entity59 on sunday			1
but he wrote : ' to be fair to the ( @entity61 ) , they have done more than most to try to eradicate racism from the stands			1
' we are the standard - bearers			2
it 's not like going to parts of @entity65 when you would be thinking to yourself ' what are we going to get here ? '			2
even those people who are racists here tend to go into a stadium and turn the mute button on for 90 minutes			2
' but the game as a whole has to take a zero - tolerance approach			2
for years it 's been clear than @entity78 and @entity79 have shied away from doing what they needed to do			1
they have let football down time and time again			0
' the man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform the metropolitan police released images of three men they are keen to speak to following the incident in @entity8 the incident at the @entity93 metro station , which occurred ahead of @entity10 's @entity95 game against @entity96 on tuesday , was captured in mobile phone footage , which @entity0 views as a positive development			1
' the good thing to come out of what happened is that it showed how society is now so full of camera phones that to think you can get away with that sort of behaviour is crazy , ' he wrote			1
' social media platforms help identify people			0
anyone who acts like this and gets caught will be embarrassed when they go to work now			0
' but we need to find a way of weeding out the people with these ignorant feelings and help educate them			0
just punishing them is not enough			0
' @entity120 trustee @entity119 called for assault charges to be brought after the man , identified in media reports as @entity124 , was physically as well as racially attacked			0
@entity0 captaining @entity53 during their @entity126 defeat away at @entity127 on saturday former @entity129 striker @entity128 and former @entity51 defender @entity0 talking on @entity16 @entity119 told @entity134 @entity133 's @entity132 programme : ' this guy on the @entity136 was assaulted , he was pushed violently a couple of times , and i think if there are any criminal laws to be enforced then that should be done as well			1
' i was very shocked when i saw the pictures and extremely upset , not just for the individual concerned but for football in general because i thought those days were long gone			0
' within stadiums , they just do n't have a voice , these people - i would n't even call them supporters - but it manifests itself in what we saw in those pictures from @entity8			0
i think there 's a totally different behaviour ( when fans go abroad ) because they know they ca n't get away with it over here , that 's for sure			0
' we get very upset when we see our teams , particularly the black players , being subjected to that sort of language when they play abroad			0
' now we 've got people travelling , supposedly under the culture of @entity10 , spewing out that sort of language			0
it is extremely embarrassing , very upsetting , really disgusting , it does n't paint @entity170 football in the right light and we know that 99 per cent of supporters are better than that			0

@entity0 believes society has become complacent over racism
the former @entity1 defender said more education is needed
he also claimed @entity79 and @entity78 have not done enough
