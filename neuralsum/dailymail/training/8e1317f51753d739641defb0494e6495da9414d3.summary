@entity1 ' advocates have railed against graphic new public health warnings showing a father lighting a hand - rolled cigarette full of rotting flesh			1
@entity7 ( @entity6 ) today launches its new shock campaign alongside an expert review of the role of smoking in the progressive decline of the body 's major systems			2
proclaiming loudly that ' every cigarette rots you from the inside out ' , the adverts will begin to appear on digital and print billboards across the country , and also on video			2
so rotten : @entity7 ( @entity6 ) today launches its new shock anti-smoking campaign alongside an expert review of the role of smoking in the progressive decline of the body 's major systems but smokers ' rights group @entity28 called the campaign ' poisonous ' and accused @entity6 of making ' exaggerated claims '			1
urging officials to ' engage directly with consumers ' rather than use shock tactics , @entity28 chief executive @entity32 said ' there ca n't be a sane adult in the @entity38 who is n't well aware of the health risks of smoking			1
' @entity6 's campaign comes as the government 's chief medical officer warned the idea some people have that roll - ups are less harmful than ordinary cigarettes is wrong			1
professor dame @entity49 warned that both forms of smoking effectively ‘ rot ’ the body from the inside			0
she said that contrary to popular belief that roll - ups are natural and less dangerous , the tobacco contains just as many deadly chemicals			1
health officials are concerned that roll - ups are becoming increasingly popular amongst smokers who see them as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes			1
smoking : figures show that fewer in one in five @entity38 smoke , the lowest level in 80 years figures showed that 40 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women smokers use them , up from 18 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in 1990			1
but 49 per cent mistakenly believe they are less harmful , according to a survey of 627 individuals			0
professor dame @entity49 said : ‘ while many smokers know the damage cigarettes do to their hearts and lungs , they are much less likely to be aware of how harmful smoking is to the body - essentially ‘ rotting ’ it from the inside out , and roll - ups are no exception			1
smokers who use e-cigarettes are likely to stop or reduce their smoking , claims an independent review of trial data			0
almost one in 10 smokers using e-cigarettes had been able to quit the habit up to a year later , and around one - third had cut down			2
the review of two trials is published today in the @entity94 , the world ’s leading producer of systematic reviews			0
controversy continues over whether e-cigarettes have net benefits , amid fears that using them in public places will ‘ re-normalise ’ smoking , especially among young people , and reverse declining smoking rates			0
‘ january is a time when many people make @entity110 ’s resolutions to improve their health and try to stop smoking			0
‘ millions of people have used @entity115 support ( the @entity117 ’s stop smoking programme ) and we are hoping that this year , even more will take advantage of the free expertise and resources on offer			0
’ figures show that fewer in one in five @entity38 smoke , the lowest level in 80 years			1
health officials want to bring this down even further and they are concerned that rates are much higher in deprived areas			0
@entity28 described the campaign as ‘ rotten ’ , ‘ poisonous ’ and an ‘ abuse of public money ’			1
mr @entity32 said : ‘ there ca n't be a sane adult in the @entity38 who is n't well aware of the health risks of smoking			2
‘ what 's really poisonous is the way public health campaigners are constantly trying to scare and harass people with exaggerated claims and dubious statistics			2
‘ campaigns like this are an abuse of public money			0
education has been replaced by shrill scaremongering that is often counter-productive because it 's human nature to switch off when you 're being nagged or shouted at on an almost daily basis			0
‘ this is real life , not a @entity152 film			0

@entity1 ' rights group @entity28 calls campaign ' poisonous ' and ' exaggerated '
adverts *dovetail* with new report *dispelling* the notion roll - ups are healthier
fewer in one in five @entity38 are now smokers , the lowest level in 80 years
