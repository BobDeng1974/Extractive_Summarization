by @entity1 reporter published : 15:19 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 16:08 est , 15 october 2013 a woman who moved into an upscale hotel in southeast @entity4 nine years ago after her home went into foreclosure is being evicted after running up an unpaid bill of $ 29,000			1
@entity8 , 64 , said she checked into the @entity9 in 2004 after a lupus - like disorder forced her out of her job and eventually her home			1
staff at the hotel , where rooms cost as much as $ 200 per night , have refused to explain how @entity8 was allowed to stay at the hotel for so long while accruing the massive debts			1
but they finally began eviction proceedings after she filed for bankruptcy in june and she must now leave by october 24			1
@entity8 explained that after she lost her job , she had no choice but to move into the luxurious hotel as she has no family , no friends were able to take her in and she could not get a loan			2
' home ' : a @entity4 woman , @entity8 , has been living at the @entity9 ( pictured ) for nine years after a disability forced her to leave work and eventually led to her losing her home , she said luxury : she is being evicted after owing $ 29,000 after staying in an $ 89 - a - night room at the hotel ( pictured ) ' if i could be working , this would n't have happened in the first place , ' she told @entity36 of @entity37			1
' i had no vision of staying for nine and a half years , ' she added to @entity39			0
' but with no family , no longer with a home , the hotel became home and the staff became family			2
' she said that she was able to make some of the $ 89 - per - day fees with her monthly disability benefits , which total at $ 783 , but that she could not afford all of them			2
she claimed that she had accrued so many reward points during her stay that she reached the platinum level , the highest category , and hoped that this would knock money of the total bill			0
but when she tried to use points to pay for her stay , the hotel revoked her account - enforcing the small print , which says they reserve the right to reject any application of the points			2
she filed for bankruptcy in august and the @entity9 began its eviction proceedings			1
plan : her lawyer , @entity69 , said there is a possibility she could get subsidized housing a @entity74 judge granted the eviction on friday after @entity76 and her attorney , @entity69 , failed to show up in court			0
as @entity8 has been at the hotelfor more than 30 days , she is not a ' transient ' and landlord - tenant laws apply			0
the hotel therefore had to go through eviction procedures and could not forcibly make her leave			0
but hotel general manager @entity84 declined to discuss her case further , citing customer privacy , and calls from @entity88 seeking comment were not returned			0
her attorney , @entity69 , said there was a possibility she could get subsidized housing , which she qualifies for , but that the process could take weeks .			0

@entity8 moved into a $ 89 - a - night room at the @entity9 in @entity37 , @entity4 in 2004 after a disability caused her to lose her job and home
after she filed for bankruptcy in august , the hotel began eviction proceedings and a judge ruled she must leave by october 24
hotel staff declined to say why she had been allowed to stay for so long
