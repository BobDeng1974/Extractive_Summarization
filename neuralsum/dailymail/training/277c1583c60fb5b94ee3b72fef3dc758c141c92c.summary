he 's been to some high places in his time , but now @entity3 has turned even the @entity5 green - by lighting a cannabis joint in the bathroom			1
the rapper claimed he reassured @entity10 agents he would only be igniting a ' napkin ' before having a luxurious solo smoke on a recent visit			2
if his story is true he joins the likes of country singer @entity16 , who famously lit up a joint at @entity18 during the presidency of @entity20			2
when asked about his habit in 2006 , @entity36 famously replied : ' i inhaled frequently			1
' the confession was made on @entity3 's @entity41 ( ' @entity42 ' ) @entity43 show during an appearance by comedian and talk show host @entity30			0
@entity30 asked him : ' have you ever smoked at the @entity5 ? ' @entity3 replied : ' in the bathroom , not in the @entity5 but in the bathroom			1
it 's got history : @entity16 famously lit up a joint in the executive mansion during the term of @entity20 puff : @entity36 ( left in 1979 ) smoked heavily when he was younger and when asked whether he had inhaled in 2006 , he famously replied : ' that was the point '			1
@entity3 visited the @entity5 in december ( right ) ' i said " may i use the bathroom for a second ? "			1
and they said " what are you going to do , a number one or number two ? "			0
' @entity30 laughed and asked : ' who said this , the @entity68 ? ' @entity3 replied : ' nah , the @entity69			2
' so i said look , when i do a number two i usually have a cigarette or light something to get the aroma right			0
' and they said " you know what , you can light a piece of napkin " and i said " i 'll do that "			0
' taking an enormous puff on a marijuana joint , @entity3 added : ' and the napkin was this '			1
the 42 - year - old rapper , real name @entity88 , was at the @entity5 in december for the @entity90			1
he attended in a smart bow tie with other members of the music world to pay tribute to legends @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , opera star @entity99 and actress @entity100			0
risky : the rapper ( right ) told @entity30 he had managed to evade agents from the @entity69 or the @entity70 @entity103 : @entity3 is famous for his music - but also for his self - confessed , widely publicised cannabis use president @entity36 recently told the @entity107 magazine marijuana was no more harmful than alcohol			1
he was speaking as the debate continues over the decriminalisation - and even full legalisation - of the drug in certain states , spinning off a range of products from cannabis massage oils to cannabis coffee			0
' as has been well documented , i smoked pot as a kid , ' he said			0
' and i view it as a bad habit and a vice , not very different from the cigarettes that i smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life			2
' he added poorer sections of society including @entity131 and @entity132 were punished harsher for the same use than the middle classes			0
@entity3 's claim remains sadly unsubstantiated .			0
