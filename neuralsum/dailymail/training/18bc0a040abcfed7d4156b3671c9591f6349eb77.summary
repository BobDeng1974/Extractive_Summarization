how much would you pay for a car which is 18 years old and has been crashed – twice – by its not - so - careful owner ? well , if it ’s @entity5 ’s @entity4 that you have your eye on , you ’ll need an astonishing £ 8million			1
the @entity8 and mr @entity9 star has decided to part company with the 241mph @entity12 supercar which he bought new in 1997 for a then eye - watering £ 540,000			1
for sale : @entity5 poses with his @entity4 supercar , which was rebuilt by @entity4 at a cost of £ 900,000 @entity5 , 60 , first pranged the three - seater by hitting a @entity16 , then in 2011 he lost control on a slippery bend and smashed into a tree			1
that second crash ended in what is thought to be @entity12 ’s highest ever single car insurance payout , with the vehicle costing £ 900,000 to be rebuilt by @entity4			1
it also put up his annual insurance to an estimated £ 60,000			0
but it seems that the accidents may have actually added to the value of the @entity4 , which is now on the market with @entity32 dealer @entity30 , owned by @entity33 , formerly a director at @entity4			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ if i had the choice of buying a 1,000 - mile @entity4 that has been hidden away or @entity5 ’s with 41,000 miles , i would take @entity5 ’s			1
it has the interesting history and this is what people look for			0
@entity40 : @entity5 's car following the 2011 crash			1
he lost control on a slippery bend and smashed into a tree his car was destroyed after a crash ( pictured ) - but he successfully claimed £ 9,100 for repairs - the highest car insurance payout recorded in @entity12 the actor escaped escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder , but his vehicle was almost written - off ‘ a lot of cars are indicative of the people who own them , and a lot of serious car collectors own an @entity4 and that gives it great credibility			1
@entity62 has one , @entity63 has more than one			0
’ he added : ‘ it is pretty much a brand - new car too after the work carried out by @entity4			1
it ’s got full tax and @entity70 and is ready to go			0
’ @entity5 , who last year split from his wife of 23 years , @entity71 , said he had never seen the car as an investment			1
‘ i bought it for the quality of the thinking that went into its design , and now it has become a thing of value it is time for it to be enjoyed by someone else , ’ he told the @entity74			0
despite the accidents , the value of @entity5 's @entity4 has continued to soar and he has put it on the market for £ 8million the front of the @entity4 car was also wrecked in a collision with the rear of a @entity16 in october 1999 ‘ it ’s so quiet , so comfortable that you can use it , and enjoy it , on any journey			1
most of the miles i have done in it are journeys you might do in any other car – going to @entity98 ’s or doing the school run			0
the comedian insisted the car was never bought as an investment and said he chose it because of the quality of the design ‘ what i enjoyed most about it when i first drove it was how lovely it was to drive slowly			1
to pootle is a pleasure			0
’ shortly after buying the carbon - fibre car , @entity5 strapped his two young children into their child seats and they went on a five - hour drive to @entity114 for a holiday			2
the @entity4 is the world ’s fastest non-turbocharged production car , doing 0 - 62mph in 3.2 seconds			2
it does an average 15 miles to the gallon – just six in the worst case – and the engine bay is lined with 25g of gold foil			0
however , driving it has not always been fun for the comic actor			0
he almost wrote it off in august 2011 when he veered off a slippery section of the @entity127 near @entity128			0
it hit a tree and burst into flames			0
@entity5 escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder , while most of the back of the @entity4 was destroyed and the 6.1 - litre engine ended up 60ft away			1
more than a year of specialist repairs at @entity4 ’s base in @entity138 , @entity139 , was needed to fix it			0
mr @entity33 added : ‘ anyone who wants a wonderful car with a great story , which includes the accidents , then this @entity4 is a fantastic thing			2
apart from the accidents , i think @entity5 has enjoyed every minute with the @entity4 and i think he will have withdrawal when it is gone			2
’ @entity5 , said to be worth £ 71million , owns an impressive collection that includes a @entity149 , a @entity150 , an @entity151 , a vintage @entity152 , a 1939 @entity153 and a @entity154			0
the @entity8 and mr @entity9 star has decided to part company with the 241mph @entity12 supercar which he bought new in 1997 for a then eye - watering £ 540,000			1
above , the actor in character as mr @entity9 the @entity8 star said owning the car has been a ' partnership ' , pictured with @entity162 ( left ) and @entity163 ( right ) the @entity165 actor added to his extensive car collection with a @entity167 ( pictured ) most cars start to depreciate the moment they leave the showroom , but luxury vehicles tend to increase in value			2
this is partly because manufacturers tightly control production , meaning there is a limited supply even for the super-rich			0
@entity4 only ever built 64 @entity180 , all of them in the 1990s			2
the market value is also boosted by famous collectors adding to the allure of owning one – those with an @entity4 include @entity186 and @entity187			0
@entity5 ’s @entity4 will also have jumped in value because it is virtually brand new having been rebuilt after his 2011 crash			1
the modern equivalent of the @entity4 is the @entity191 , which went on sale for £ 866,000 in 2013 and now fetches up to £ 1.25million			0
