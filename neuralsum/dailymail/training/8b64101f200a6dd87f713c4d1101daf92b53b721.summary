@entity0 has unveiled its most powerful car ever – the 707 horsepower @entity2			1
the muscle car tops the competition with a 6.2 liter @entity7 engine that comes in either an eight - speed automatic or a six - speed manual transmission , the car maker announced			1
it is being positioned against the supercharged likes of @entity12 ’s @entity11 and @entity15 ’s @entity14 models			0
‘ one that restricts the engine to 500 hp and another that opens the gates of the @entity2 , ' said @entity34			0
both sets are actually keyless ignition key fobs , according to @entity38			0
even with just the black key fob , the supped - up @entity2 has 15 more horsepower than the next fastest model of the @entity2			2
‘ i thought we 'd reached the point of ridiculous horsepower numbers when the @entity47 hit in 2009 with 638 horsepower , ’ @entity41 , a senior director at the automotive web site @entity43 , told @entity38			2
‘ clearly i was off , as the horsepower wars appear to have only just begun			2
’ in the dust : the 707 hp @entity50 leaves all other cars trailing behind beast : the @entity53 is second only to the @entity2 with its 660 horsepower also fast : 2014 @entity54 has a staggering 638 horsepower , but only comes in third place gas mileage and pricing have not been publicly released by the automaker , but expect both to be wallet - busting			1
the beast will hit showroom floors in the fall			0
a four - door model is also expected to be released			0
