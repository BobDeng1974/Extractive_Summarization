it is one trademark celebration we ’ve seen rather a lot of this season			2
at the final whistle , if @entity7 have claimed the three points , their captain @entity5 hangs around on the pitch			1
the fans linger too , knowing what ’s coming			2
when all his team - mates have drifted off towards the tunnel , @entity13 runs towards the stands and gives a victory shout and a fist pump			2
the crowd respond with a guttural roar of their own			2
on saturday at @entity23 , @entity13 did the celebratory fist pump no less than six times			2
it was , by popular @entity28 consensus , the most passionate one yet			0
but then this had probably been the team ’s best performance yet			0
@entity5 often leads the celebrations for @entity7 after victory at @entity23 ‘ we are going up , ’ chorused the home faithful as @entity13 ( pictured ) finally made his way off			1
@entity7 look better equipped to mount a promotion challenge than in any of the last dozen campaigns since they dropped out of the @entity41			1
this was a surprisingly straightforward victory against a high - flying @entity45 side usually so assured on their travels but timid and toothless here			1
one of the @entity7 scorers was expected , the other less so			1
@entity50 international @entity49 rattled home his 14th of the season to move top of the @entity55 scorers ’ chart , before @entity57 headed in the contest - killing second			1
the diminutive @entity57 , discarded by his former club @entity60 , may have found himself on the scrapheap again at the end of last season but stayed at @entity7 to fight for his place — with outstanding results			1
@entity57 ( left ) has impressed at @entity23 , signing after being discarded by @entity60 @entity66 has been linked with @entity67 after an outstanding season so far in defence for @entity7 ‘ i think i was waxing lyrical about him last week , ’ said manager @entity70			1
‘ he just continues to flourish and get better and better			0
‘ we made them all back themselves in a little sweepstake within the club and if they do n’t get the goals , their £ 100 goes to charity			0
he only needs another seven so he ’d better pull his finger out			0
’ there was an amusing debate about @entity57 ’s actual stature			0
@entity85 suggested 5ft 7in , @entity70 thought that might be generous			0
either way , he managed to outmuscle two burly @entity45 players in @entity89 and @entity90 to head in @entity92 ’s perfect cross			1
‘ i ’m 5ft 5in , maybe 5ft 6in but i have always had a good leap on me , ’ said @entity57			0
‘ i win my fair share of headers out there on the wing			0
@entity70 has taken @entity7 to second in the @entity55 table @entity49 ( centre ) is congratulated after scoring for @entity7 against @entity45 at the weekend ‘ i saw the ball come in and i just timed my jump well			1
i probably leaned into them a bit to win it but i managed to get above them			0
‘ @entity70 said to me at the end of last season things have n’t really worked out so if a club came in for me or i wanted to leave he would not stand in my way			0
‘ but i said “ no ” straight away			0
i like @entity7 , i like @entity110 , i like the gaffer and @entity113 [ assistant manager @entity112 ] , and i wanted to stay and fight for my place			1
i ’ve done that and it ’s working out			0
’ with left - back @entity66 linked with a move to @entity67 , @entity70 is also braced for a flurry of interest in 18 - year - old midfielder @entity92 , whom @entity45 boss @entity120 described as the best player on the park			1
@entity92 , a product of the club ’s academy , has made his breakthrough this season but @entity70 issued a stern hands - off			2
‘ it would be wrong anyway			0
he should play his football here			0
it ’s funny , when he starts doing well , everyone wants to get him out the door and sell him to a big @entity41 club			0
if he wants to play in the @entity41 , let ’s see if we get there , ’ said the @entity7 manager			1
you can only imagine the @entity13 fist pump if they do make it			0
@entity143 manager @entity142 insisted the @entity145 loss to @entity146 would n’t affect his team			1
he was proved emphatically correct as the @entity148 routed @entity149 6 - 1 to ensure the @entity151 1 spot at @entity152			1
@entity155 ’s goal to make it 3 - 0 was pick of the bunch			2
@entity143 manager @entity142 ( right ) applauds @entity143 's fans after beating @entity149 6 - 1 ‘ it was an horrendous day , ’ said @entity149 manager @entity159			1
‘ i ’m angry , disappointed , embarrassed and upset			0
’ not the best start for new @entity60 boss @entity162 as they went down 1 - 0 at home to 10 - man @entity165			1
they ’ve now not scored in their last three championship games at the @entity168			0
@entity170 boss @entity169 said his team were ‘ sensational ’ as they routed @entity172 7 - 0 to move into the automatic promotion spots in @entity174			2
@entity162 lost his first game as @entity60 manager 1 - 0 at home against @entity165 , who went down to 10 men @entity179 struck twice and there were five other scorers			1
@entity182 left @entity185 ’s nine - match unbeaten run in tatters with a 3 - 0 win at @entity188 to move third in @entity189			2
the @entity190 have won their last eight home league games .			2
