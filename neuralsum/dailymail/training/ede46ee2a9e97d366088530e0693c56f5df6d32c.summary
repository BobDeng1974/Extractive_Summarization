by @entity0 published : 20:52 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 05:26 est , 13 november 2013 the average price of regular gas has fallen to $ 3.19 a gallon , with drivers in eight states now able to fill up their cars for less than $ 3			0
prices have been dropping by about a penny a day , according to @entity9 , with another six states close to falling below the $ 3 mark soon			2
the fall in prices has been credited to a strong flow of cheap crude coming from @entity16 and @entity17			2
falling cost : a @entity20 worker in @entity21 changes prices at a gas station on tuesday ' in almost half the states , you do n't need to make a great effort to find gas at $ 3 or less , ' @entity24 , an oil analyst , told @entity30			1
drivers in eight states already pay less than the $ 3 per gallon average , according to @entity33			0
they are : @entity34 2.842 @entity35 2.868 @entity36 2.914 @entity37 2.922 @entity38 2.927 @entity39 2.966 @entity40 2.977 @entity41 2.995 drivers filling up on regular fuel in eight states , including @entity34 , @entity38 and @entity37 , are already benefiting from pump prices below the $ 3 average			1
it is estimated that nearly 20 per cent of gas stations across the @entity48 are already charging less than $ 3 a gallon , according to the @entity50			0
mr @entity24 believes the drop in prices will continue until the end of the year , with more than half the states coming in below the $ 3 mark by @entity56			1
the drop is in part because of a steady and cheap supply of oil , described as ' the cheapest crude on the planet ' by mr @entity24			0
refineries have benefited from a quiet hurricane season and few disruptions			0
if the supply continues uninterrupted , the national average price per gallon could fall to its lowest since 2010			1
' it â€™s been a favorable confluence of global and domestic factors that have brought us to this point and all of them suggest incrementally lower prices at the pump in the weeks ahead , ' @entity67 , senior analyst with @entity33 , said			2
however , drivers in states such as @entity78 and @entity79 , which both have an average of around $ 3.50 at the pump , and @entity81 which has the highest average at 4.020 , are unlikely to benefit from a drop in prices			2
driving down costs : a map of the @entity48 shows the average pump prices , with red being the most expensive areas and dark green having the lowest average the prices in some states will also suffer from fuel taxes			1
@entity79 , which has the third highest pump price , adds tax at 48.7 cents , according to @entity96			0
@entity78 drivers pay the most in tax for their gas , at 50.6 cents , according to figures from january , where as @entity101 charges the least , at 8 cents			0
the national average for state tax , which includes excise , environmental fees , storage tank taxes and general sales tax , is 18.4 cents .			1
