@entity1 star @entity0 has launched an astonishing attack on @entity3 as he accused the @entity5 club of having a long history of ‘ manipulating ’ people and situations for their own benefit			1
the frustrated @entity11 star claimed there have been ‘ continual injustices ’ across the three games between @entity1 and @entity3 this month that have yielded six red cards - four for @entity16 ’s team			1
in the wake of the stormy 1 - 1 @entity20 draw at @entity11 , @entity3 manager @entity21 and his captain @entity22 both accused @entity1 kid @entity23 of ‘ diving ’ to win his side a penalty			1
@entity0 ( right ) believes @entity3 ' manipulate people ' and have been doing so for the past few years despite @entity21 calling on the @entity29 to take action , none was forthcoming but @entity1 were subsequently denied a penalty when @entity22 barged @entity32 in the @entity33 , won 2 - 0 by @entity3 at @entity34 last sunday			1
and after the 4 - 0 @entity20 replay win at @entity5 on wednesday , @entity21 accused @entity36 of endangering the career of @entity38 with a wild lunge			2
but the @entity1 camp felt the reaction of @entity3 ’s players may have influenced @entity44 ’s decision to send the @entity45 off			1
the @entity1 star and @entity21 have previous when they clashed at @entity11 in the quarter - final and ahead of the fourth and final match between @entity1 and @entity3 at @entity5 in the @entity49 on saturday , @entity0 appeared to accuse @entity3 of heaping pressure on match officials			1
‘ @entity21 has an opinion on everything but i do n’t really read too much into what he has to say or who he puts pressure on , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but i think @entity3 as a club can manipulate people more than @entity1 can			1
that kind of thing has been happening for years			0
the tough tackling midfielder goes up for a header with @entity3 star @entity63 in the cup final on sunday ‘ we have seen injustices in the last few games we have played and that causes frustration			1
it feels that we do not get any decisions and that it is continual			2
‘ i saw things differently ( to @entity21 )			0
i do n’t think @entity36 deserved to get sent off as he clearly won the ball			0
i do n’t know if i am being biased but it is a hard tackle but he clearly won the ball			0
‘ i do n’t think there was much in it ( but ) they have made a lot of it			2
it looked like a good tackle to me but that is only my opinion			0
’ @entity36 ( right ) was sent off for a tackle on @entity86 and angered @entity3 's players @entity0 ’s sense of injustice was also stoked by the failure of referee @entity44 to hand a second yellow to @entity92 for a foul on @entity94 at 1 - 0			1
he continued : ‘ i thought he was lucky to stay on the park but we have seen it in the last few meetings that we do n’t seem to get things like that going for us against @entity3			2
‘ how he stayed on the park i will never know			0
it was a clear yellow card			1
but when you come to places like ( @entity5 ) you never seem to get these decisions			2
‘ i do n’t know if it is just coincidence but you saw last weekend in the @entity33 we should have had a clear penalty			0
@entity0 believes @entity92 ( centre ) should also have been sent off for a second bookable offence ‘ then @entity92 should have got sent off when we were on top in the game and it did not happen			1
small things like that change games			0
’ @entity0 also defended himself after @entity3 ’s @entity117 yesterday accused the @entity1 midfielder of catching him with a ‘ sly elbow ’			1
@entity117 was sent off for retaliation but later said on @entity121 : ‘ i get a sly elbow in the face by someone that has nothing about them and get sent off , typical ! ’ but @entity0 pleaded his innocence , saying : ‘ i have ran across him and i do n’t know if he thinks i have meant to hit him but he has lashed out and caught me on the side of the face			2
‘ i stepped across him and i do n’t know if i have caught him with my leg or my arm			0
i honestly do n’t know but it was certainly not intentional			0
‘ but there ’s no edge between the two teams			0
it ’s been taken out of context as there were not really any bad challenges in the game			0
we come back to @entity5 on saturday in the league with a clean slate			0
