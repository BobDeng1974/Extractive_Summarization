@entity7 , 49 , who has known @entity8 since they were students together at @entity10 and then @entity11 , was so enraged by a newspaper article about him that he believed ' humiliated ' his wife , @entity14 - born @entity13 , he flew from his home in @entity16 to exact revenge			1
notoriously vengeful @entity7 , who served time in prison for faking a jewel heist , tracked the journalist down to his home , lay in wait for him and then knocked him to the ground as he left the house before tipping a sack of horse manure over him			1
@entity7 , pictured with wife @entity13 , sought revenge on a journalist over a perceived insult in an article boasting about his attack on the man , @entity7 - a former friend and @entity11 peer of both @entity8 and @entity30 , wrote : ' i waited for him to emerge from his house , chased him , and then , having knocked him to the ground , emptied over his head a sack of horse manure rendered slurry by the addition of bottled water - a concoction made possible courtesy of @entity46 @entity45 and the springs of @entity48			1
' the aim had been not to hurt him but to humiliate him as he had sought to humiliate my wife			0
' and humiliate him is exactly what i did , in front of his neighbours who had poured out on to the street at the sound of his screams			0
' writing in the @entity57 , @entity7 said he had two friends with him filming the entire incident , but he says he chose not to put the footage onto the internet as he did not wish to hurt the journalist 's family			2
his article , entitled who will bully the @entity67 ? names neither the journalist nor the article that upset him , although earlier this year an article appeared in a broadsheet newspaper that cast an aspersion on mrs @entity74 's past			0
@entity8 has said of his old friend that he lives by ' the @entity77 code of honour , loyalty and revenge '			2
@entity7 , back row , fourth from right , was a member of the notorious @entity82 at @entity11 with @entity8 , centre front in a recent @entity86 interview with @entity87 , the @entity3 mayor denied tracking down a tabloid journalist 20 years ago whom @entity7 wanted beaten up over probings into him for an article			1
the affair that the journalist , @entity92 , was looking into was the fraud that resulted - eventually - in @entity7 going to jail			0
@entity7 and @entity30 were best men at each other 's weddings - this was at @entity30 's wedding to model @entity100 angry with insurers @entity101 after his father lost his home and money in the 1990s financial crisis , @entity7 and his fellow @entity11 graduate @entity106 hired a stooge to tie them up in their room at the @entity109 in @entity110 and shoot a mattress			2
when police arrived they convinced them they had been the subject of a jewel heist - @entity7 ' sobbing like a baby ' for effect			1
@entity120 's paid up for the ' stolen ' jewels within weeks , but the stooge , @entity123 , was angry at the small sum he had been paid for his part in the fraud			0
@entity92 started looking into the incident , and @entity7 got wind of it			0
@entity123 recorded a conversation between @entity7 and @entity8 in which they discussed finding the journalist and @entity7 said : ' there is nothing i wo n't do to get my revenge '			2
in 1993 @entity7 was jailed for five years and ordered to pay a £ 533,000 fine			1
@entity7 said he had no money and declared himself bankrupt , and was ordered to stay in jail until the fine was paid			0
but a mystery benefactor lent him £ 165,000 to get him out jail - a man many suspected was his old friend @entity30			2
@entity7 was freed in 1996 and moved first to @entity142 and then to @entity143			0
@entity7 still lives in @entity143 with his wife , with whom he has three children , but has fallen out with his old friend @entity30 over unfounded suggestions the latter had tried to seduce his wife			1
today there were calls on @entity151 for @entity7 to be arrested over the alleged assault , but a @entity154 spokesman told @entity155 they had not been asked to investigate any such incident .			0
