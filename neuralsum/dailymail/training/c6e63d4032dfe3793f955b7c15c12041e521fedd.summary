by @entity0 @entity1 : 13:47 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:13 est , 18 december 2013 neanderthals liked to be close to their families - very close , a genetic study has shown			0
dna from a @entity3 woman 's 50,000 - year - old toe bone shows she was highly inbred			1
scientists discovered that her parents were either half - siblings who shared the same mother , an uncle and niece , an aunt and nephew , or a grandparent and grandchild			1
the toe bone of a @entity3 woman , recovered from a cave in @entity21			1
50,000 year - old dna extracted from the bone was used to produce the most complete sequence so far of the genome of this group of early humans alternatively , they may have been double first cousins - offspring of two siblings and their siblings			1
the inbreeding may have been the result of @entity3 population groups being very small , experts believe			1
analysis of the dna also revealed evidence of interbreeding between @entity3 , @entity39 - a @entity3 sister group from @entity21 - and early modern humans			1
neanderthals were a human sub-species who lived alongside our own ancestors in @entity47 for thousands of years before vanishing about 30,000 years ago			0
scientists discovered that the @entity3 's parents were either half - siblings who shared the same mother , an uncle and niece , an aunt and nephew , or a grandparent and grandchild the evidence of inbreeding was uncovered by an analysis led by dr @entity59 , a population geneticist at the @entity60			1
his team sequenced the genome from dna extracted from the toe bone of a @entity3 woman whose remains were found in a @entity21 cave in the @entity68			1
' we performed simulations of several inbreeding scenarios and discovered that the parents of this @entity3 individual were either half siblings who had a mother in common , double first cousins , an uncle and a niece , an aunt and a nephew , a grandfather and a granddaughter , or a grandmother and a grandson , ' he said			1
neanderthals and @entity39 were found to be closely related , parting company on the evolutionary path 300,000 years ago			1
more than 100,000 years earlier , they and modern humans had a common ancestor			0
the scientists estimated that between 1.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent of the genomes of modern @entity93 people can be traced to @entity3			2
although like early modern humans they made tools and weapons , their lack of inventiveness and social structure may have led to their demise			0
for many years scientists argued about whether @entity3 and modern humans ever interbred			2
dna studies have now proved that they did , and many people alive today still carry ancient @entity3 genes			1
the new findings , published in the journal nature , come from the most complete blueprint of a @entity3 genetic code , or genome , ever constructed			0
scientists sequenced the genome from dna extracted from the toe bone of a @entity3 woman whose remains were found in a @entity21 cave in the @entity68			1
comparing it with the genomes of modern humans and @entity39 revealed some surprises			0

the scientists estimated that between 1.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent of the genomes of modern @entity93 people can be traced to @entity3			2
denisovans are also believed to have left their genetic traces , though only in some oceanic and @entity151 populations			0
the study also identified at least 87 specific genes in modern humans that stand out as significantly different from any found in @entity3 or @entity39			2
they may hold clues to why the @entity3 and @entity39 died out while modern humans survived			0
the list of genes contains a ' catalogue ' of features setting modern humans apart from all other creatures , living or extinct , according to dr @entity164 , from the @entity165 in @entity166 , @entity167 , who led the international team			0
' i believe that in it hide some of the things that made the enormous expansion of human populations and human culture and technology in the last 100,000 years possible , ' he said			0
scientists sequenced the genome from dna extracted from the toe bone of a @entity3 woman whose remains were found in a @entity21 cave in the @entity68 @entity185 in the @entity68 of southern @entity21			1
at various times over the past 50,000 years , three different groups of early humans - @entity3 , @entity39 and modern humans - lived in the cave in addition the genome comparisons showed that @entity39 bred with a fourth group of humans living in @entity47 that had an ancestry dating back more than a million years			0
the scientists believe this mysterious relation may have been @entity198 , which fossils show inhabited @entity200 and @entity201 at least a million years ago			0
' the paper really shows that the history of humans and hominins during this period was very complicated , ' said prof @entity59			0
' there was lot of interbreeding that we know about and probably other interbreeding we have n't yet discovered			0
' professor @entity213 , a leading expert in human origins at @entity216 's @entity215 , said the inbreeding disclosed by the @entity3 woman 's dna must have gone on ' for a number of generations '			1
he added : ' despite the fact that her ancestors had ranged widely in @entity47 for tens of millennia , her genomic diversity was less than that found in a small population of hunter - gatherers living in the @entity231 rainforest today			2
' this suggests that the historical population sizes of both @entity39 and @entity3 in @entity47 were much lower than those maintained by ancestral modern humans in @entity236			0

discovery was made after dna analysis on a @entity3 woman 's toe bone
her mother and father were closely related and may have been half - siblings
inbreeding may have been result of @entity3 population being very small
scientists say many people alive today still carry ancient @entity3 genes
