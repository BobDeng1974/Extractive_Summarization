by @entity0 for @entity1 a couple fear their seven - year - old boy has been scarred for life by a huge henna tattoo on his back - of @entity9 character @entity8			1
@entity10 was rewarded with the temporary image of his favourite @entity9 character for his good behaviour at the end of the family two - week holiday to @entity17			1
but a week after getting home - on his birthday - he woke in agony with his back covered in sores and blisters after a reaction to the black dye used to colour his skin			1
and while the henna ink has faded the grimacing face of the evil @entity45 is clearly visible on his badly - damaged skin			2
@entity10 has been told to avoid the sunshine for the rest of summer and doctors have warned his worried mother @entity51 he may be forced to stay inside for the next two years as his body battles the horrific condition			1
tearful @entity10 said : ' my mum and dad said i could get the tattoo on the last day of our holiday if i was a good boy , and i was a good boy every day			1
' @entity8 from the @entity61 is my favourite @entity9 character			1
' i was so happy			0
but then on my birthday i woke up and it was all sore			2
@entity10 woke up in agony on his birthday having suffered a severe allergic reaction to the henna ink ' i hate it			1
i wish i had not had it done			0
my summer has been spoilt and i was really looking forward to playing out with my friends			0
' @entity10 went on holiday with his mother @entity51 , father @entity75 , both 45 , and four - year - old sister @entity34 for a two - week trip to the @entity77 and @entity78 , in @entity79 , @entity17			1
on july 7 , the last full day of their trip , @entity51 paid for her , @entity10 and @entity34 to all get temporary tattoos to mark the trip			2
@entity10 has been told he must stay inside and out of sunlight while his skin heals but while one artist inked a design on her leg and a small flower on @entity34 's foot , a second used what was advertised as black henna to cover half of @entity10 's back			1
while traditional henna - made from the plant @entity99 ( @entity99 ) - has been used for centuries to dye everything from cloth to hair , and is generally considered safe , many vendors reporting to use henna in fact use a variety of other chemicals to produce a much darker dye			2
true henna will produce a redish brown colour on the skin , which becomes darker the longer it is left on before washing			2
other forms of skin dyes often are more black in colour			0
@entity51 , of @entity114 , @entity115 , said : ' @entity10 's tattoo was so much thicker than mine and @entity34 's			1
' we were fine , we did n't have any problems at all			0
' but the guy that was doing @entity10 's was using a separate pot of ink and i reckon there must have been something in that			2
doctors have warned @entity10 may be forced to stay inside for the next two years as his body battles the horrific condition ' a week after , on the morning of his birthday , @entity10 came downstairs in tears , screaming " @entity133 , my back , my back			1
" ' i had a look at it and i could n't believe what i was seeing			0
' it was a huge red weal where the henna had been , and his skin around it was all rashy , red and sore			2
' i took him to the doctor , who said it was the worst skin reaction he had ever seen			0
' it was an allergic reaction to some chemical in the ink			1
if i had known this would happen , of course i would never have let him go anywhere near it			0
' @entity51 added : ' i 'm so frustrated			0
it 's been an absolute nightmare			0
' i told the hotel what had happened , and the holiday company , but nobody has even emailed me back			0
' i just want to warn other people to steer clear of henna tattoos			0
' @entity10 is scarred for life now , and may be stuck inside for two years if he starts getting more of a reaction to sunlight			1
' it 's ruined all of our lives			0
i feel so sorry for him			0
' since his diagnosis @entity10 has been proscribed two lots of antibiotics , two different steroid creams , and has been given a range of medicinal washes and lotions in a bid to try to calm his raging back , which is slowly showing signs of improvement .			1
