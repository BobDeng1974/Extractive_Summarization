labour leader @entity0 used a speech in @entity2 to set out why he would not back an @entity4 referendum , unless @entity5 tries to seize more powers @entity0 today faced a backlash from within the @entity8 after ruling out holding an referendum on @entity10 leaving the @entity4			1
the @entity8 leader is refusing to match @entity13 ’s pledge to hold a vote by the end of 2017 on whether @entity10 should stay in the @entity4			1
in an attempt to appear at least open to the idea of a referendum , mr @entity0 says he would only hold a vote if the @entity10 decides to hand even more powers to @entity21 – something even he admits is ‘ unlikely ’			1
but one labour mp dismissed it as a ' shoddy compromise ' while another said the party had to be more ' trusting ' of people			2
@entity8 donor @entity29 said the growth of the @entity4 's influence over @entity10 in the past 40 years ' warrants a referendum regardless of future events '			1
but a shadow cabinet source admitted that opposition to a vote was the party 's only policy which business liked			0
it pitches @entity8 and the @entity43 party into a bitter battle over who is willing to give the public a say			0
it was greeted with delight last night in @entity49			0
speaking at the @entity50 , mr @entity0 insisted that a @entity8 government would not be part of an ' inexorable drive to an ever closer union ' in @entity21			1
he said that while he believed it was ' unlikely ' that there would be any moves to transfer any more power to @entity5 in the next parliament , his new ' legislative lock ' would ensure the public would have a say before that could happen			1
' now , there are no current proposals from other countries for such a transfer of powers			2
' and i do not believe this is the direction in which @entity21 should head			0
indeed , i think some powers should come back the other way			2
but we can not be certain about the emerging shape of @entity21 , ' he said			0
but mr @entity13 dismissed the new policy as a fudge cooked up by a committee trying to please a range of conflicting views inside the @entity8			0
speaking to reporters on a trip to @entity83 , the prime minister said the @entity85 's intervention meant the @entity43 will be the only mainstream party guaranteeing a referendum on @entity21 , both at may 's @entity88 elections and the @entity89 next year			2
mr @entity13 said : ' this is a policy clearly designed by a committee - a committee who obviously could n't decide what to do , who have come up with a policy that makes no sense whatsoever			0
' the @entity10 people now have a very , very clear choice - at the next election they can elect a @entity43 government that will renegotiate @entity10 's position in @entity21 and give people a guaranteed in / out referendum by the end of 2017			1
' if they get a @entity8 government they will get no referendum , no choice , no reform - nothing			2
' it 's absolutely clear - you get @entity0 , you do n't get a referendum , you do n't get a choice			1
it 's the classic labour " we know best " approach to politics			2
' mr @entity0 was criticised by some @entity118 for the fudge in response to the @entity43 pledge of a referendum by 2017 the @entity8 told the @entity50 that threatening @entity10 's membership of the @entity4 risked causing damage to the economy mr @entity0 ’s move will exasperate senior figures in his own party , who have been pressing him to match the prime minister ’s pledge			1
but after shadow chancellor @entity132 announced a fresh tax raid on pensions , bankers and houses to fund a youth jobs scheme , it is hoped that ruling out an @entity4 referendum will help bolster @entity8 's support among business leaders			1
one shadow cabinet minister told @entity144 : ‘ opposing a referendum is our only policy which businesses like			2
rightly or wrongly – and it is unfair – there is the impression that we are anti-business			0
' why would we give up the only thing which marks us out from the @entity151 which business like ? ’ mr @entity0 has launched a series of attacks on big business including energy firms , pensions companies and banking			1
today it emerged shadow employment minister @entity160 had launched a scathing attack on capitalism			0
he claimed businesses were ' driven by greed ' and that unethical business practices were ' the natural way that capitalism operates ' , the @entity163 reported			2
but the decision was greeted with dismay by some in the party			0
labour donor @entity29 , who gave the party £ 1.5million last year , said : ' the growth of the @entity4 's influence over @entity10 warrants a referendum regardless of future events			1
' @entity8 backbencher @entity178 said : ' i think it 's a shoddy compromise really , between those people in the @entity182 who want a referendum because the vast majority of the electorate want it , and those people desperate not to have a referendum			2
' i think the public are very clear that they want a referendum			2
this is so ambiguous as to be impossible to sell on the doorstep			0
' @entity8 mp @entity193 said he still hoped mr @entity0 would go further and commit to an in - out referendum even if no power transfer is on the table			1
' certainly i 've polled very ( extensively ) @entity8 votes in my area , and without question , they 're more hostile than they were to the @entity4 - significantly more so - and i think that we need to be in touch and we need to be trusting the people , ' he told @entity204 's @entity205			0
' so i hope that over the next few months he 'll go further and say that the @entity182 's going to trust the people and let the people have a say on this			0
' one @entity8 frontbencher said mr @entity0 had ruled out a referendum as the only policy which business supported however , business leaders have warned the prospect of an @entity4 referendum would cause unnecessary uncertainty and threaten the economy			1
the @entity219 argues it ' is in our shared interests for the @entity10 to stay in the @entity4 '			2
in response to mr @entity0 's announcement , by sir @entity224 , head of advertising and media giant @entity225 , said : ' i would say not having a referendum is better than having one			1
having a referendum creates more uncertainty			0
the last thing we need is more uncertainty			0
' mr @entity13 used a speech in january last year to promise to claw back powers from @entity5 before holding an in - out referendum by the end of 2017			1
@entity8 dithered for months about whether to match the pledge , with mr @entity132 and international development spokesman @entity239 among those urging mr @entity0 to include the promise of a referendum in the 2015 manifesto			1
ex-business secretary @entity244 said mr @entity0 was showing ' strong leadership ' by ruling out a popular policy but writing in the @entity163 , mr @entity0 says : ‘ my priorities for government after the election are very different from the conservatives			1
' @entity8 will focus on dealing with the cost - of - living crisis by building a better economy so people can look forward to a better future for their children			0
‘ an arbitrary timetable for a referendum on leaving @entity21 would damage our ability to deliver on these priorities			0
’ he adds : ‘ the next @entity8 government will legislate for a new lock : there would be no transfer of powers from the @entity10 to the @entity4 without a referendum on our continued membership of the @entity4			1
’ mr @entity0 's decision is also a blow to @entity271 , whose leader @entity272 had repeatedly insisted mr @entity0 would be forced to buckle and agree to a referendum			1
the @entity8 leader stressed his determination to reform the @entity4 if elected in 2015 , and pledged a legal lock that would guarantee an in - out vote if @entity278 was asked to hand over more control			0
the legal lock proposed by mr @entity0 would effectively upgrade the one introduced by the coalition which guarantees a referendum before any powers are transferred			1
@entity8 's position aligns it closely with the @entity286 on @entity21 , offering common ground for any potential negotiations about forming a joint government in 2015			0
posting on @entity290 last night , mr @entity13 said : ' by his own admission , @entity0 says it 's unlikely there 'll be an in - out referendum on @entity21 under @entity8			1
' only the @entity43 can guarantee and deliver that referendum			0
' prime minister @entity13 , pictured meeting @entity83 prime minister @entity295 during a visit to @entity297 today , said only the @entity151 would offer a vote mr @entity13 could not contain is delight at @entity8 's decision to rule out matching his pledge on holding an in - out referendum a @entity43 spokesman added : ‘ our relationship with @entity21 is n’t working and it needs to change			0
that ’s why @entity13 has set out a plan to seek a new settlement for @entity10 in @entity21 , and then put it to the @entity10 people in an in - out referendum by the end of 2017			1
‘ both @entity8 and the @entity286 oppose this plan – they wo n’t give the people a referendum and @entity271 simply can not deliver one			0
only the @entity43 will trust the @entity10 people to have their say on our country ’s future			2
’ former labour business secretary @entity244 hailed mr @entity0 's decision as an example of strong leadership			1
he told @entity204 : ' most people in the first instance will say that a referendum has looked quite popular amongst many in the public and therefore he ’s doing something which shows strong leadership in standing up against that position			0
' but even those who disagree with him generally on matters , on a referendum in particular , i think they will admire him for showing leadership and guts on a major issue			0
' therefore this is a test of him and his approach to leadership as much as to the issue itself , and for those who are worried about @entity10 just sleepwalking out of @entity21 , not only those who are running businesses and depending on @entity21 ’s vast market , @entity341 ’s statement will be particularly important and welcome			2
but his comments indicated a dramatic change of heart , having argued in 2010 : ' i believe a fresh referendum will be necessary because the political parties can not reconcile their own differences and come to a final conclusion on their own , and nor should they			0

@entity0 said only if @entity10 forced to hand more powers to @entity5
wrote in @entity163 he thought that was ' unlikely ' *circumstance*
senior labour *mps* , such as @entity132 , have urged him for a referendum
