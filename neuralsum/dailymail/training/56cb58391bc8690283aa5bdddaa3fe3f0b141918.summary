hunters in @entity1 developed an innovative way of crafting stone tools 325,000 years ago â€“ at the same time as it was being developed in @entity5			1
the find suggests @entity1 were more innovative than previously thought and contradicts the widely - held belief that innovation spread as a result of humanity 's @entity10			1
the discovery centres on a stone tool production method known as @entity15 technology , which involves breaking different sizes of flakes off a larger lump of stone			1
pictured are tone tools found at the site of nor @entity22 , @entity23			2
the top stones were created using biface technology , which is more primitive than @entity14 ( bottom )			0
the find suggests ancient @entity1 were more innovative than previously thought the resulting flakes were then used as knives or other tools , which would have been relatively easy to carry by the fast - moving hunter - gatherers of the time			0
stone tools using this method were found in sediments at a site in @entity23 between two ancient layers of lava dated to a period between 325,000 and 350,000 years ago			1
more primitive stone tools were also found at the same site			2
they were created using ' bifacial technology ' where tools were created through the removal of flakes from a rock			0
the flakes were discarded as waste and the mass of stone used as the final tool			0
archaeologists claim the @entity15 technology was more economical because fewer raw materials were thrown away in the process			2
' the combination of these different technologies in one place suggests that , about 325,000 years ago , people at the site were innovative , ' said dr @entity59 ( pictured ) , from @entity60 who led the study they previously believed that @entity15 technology was invented in @entity5 and spread to @entity1 with expanding human populations			1
but the fact that the two technology were found the nor @entity22 site in @entity23 provides the first clear evidence that local populations developed @entity15 technology on their own			1
levallois technology is a name given by archaeologists to a method of creating stone tools developed during the @entity77 period			2
the technique involves breaking different , pre-determined sizes of flakes off a lump of stone			1
the resulting flakes are then used as knives or other tools , which would have been relatively easy to carry by the fast - moving hunter - gatherers of the time			0
levallois technology was named after the site where it was first discovered in @entity90 ' the combination of these different technologies in one place suggests to us that , about 325,000 years ago , people at the site were innovative , ' said dr @entity59 from @entity60 who led the study			0
as well as this , chemical analysis of several hundred stone tools shows that humans at the site used material from rocky outcrops from as far away as 75 miles ( 120km )			0
this suggests hunters must also have been capable of exploiting large , environmentally diverse territories			0
this conclusion challenges the view held by some archaeologists that technological change resulted from population expansion during this period			0
' if i were to take all the artefacts from the site and show them to an archaeologist , they would immediately begin to categorise them into chronologically distinct groups , ' said professor @entity59			0
the stone tools found at nor @entity22 , however , reflect the flexibility and variability of a single population during a period of major behavioural and biological change			1
the fact that the two technology were found the nor @entity22 site in @entity23 provides the first clear evidence that local populations developed @entity15 technology on their own			1

stone tools between 325,000 and 350,000 - years - old were found in @entity23
some were created using a method known as @entity15 technology
this involves breaking different sizes of flakes off a larger lump of stone
@entity15 tools were found in the larva *alongside* more primitive knives
this contradicts the widely - held belief that innovation in @entity15 tool - making spread as a result of man 's *migration* out of @entity5
