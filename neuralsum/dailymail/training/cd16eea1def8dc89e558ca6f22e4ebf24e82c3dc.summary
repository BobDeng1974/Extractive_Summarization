the photographer who last week shared photographs of @entity3 cricket legend @entity2 posing with a gun beside the bodies of hunted animals , has revealed he has received countless death threats since friday			1
acclaimed wildlife photographer @entity8 , who is originally from @entity9 , has spent much of his life shooting animals in the region - but always from behind the lens of a camera rather than the barrel of a gun			1
@entity8 , who is currently based in @entity17 , posted the images of @entity2 to his @entity20 page last week , after they were sent to him by a friend			1
but he said the response online had been ' awful '			0
' there ’s no greater crime in @entity3 than exposing the shortcomings of a sportsman ' , he told @entity27			0
' a friend of mine sent the photographs over saying that he thought that it was a famous cricket player , ' @entity8 said			0
' i was very suspicious of the photographs at first and i put them into my big editing suite to check if they had been photo - shopped			2
after determining the images had not been altered , he decided to post them online			0
' in the end i thought the public interest was better served by showing them , ' he said			2
however @entity8 said the response from people online had been ' pretty awful , ' and revealed that he had revealed numerous death threats from people whose @entity20 pages were adorned with photographs of their children clutching dead animals			1
' i knew given what i do and the people that follow me that i thought there would be a strong reaction but i never imagined it would be as intense as its been , ' @entity8 revealed			0
' some of the language employed from people that are pro-wildlife has been pretty crazy really , ' he said , adding that he did n't know whether the hunters or animal liberators had been worse			0
@entity8 , who is currently based in @entity17 , is originally from @entity9 and said the response from both sides of the argument had been ' crazy ' the photographer 's upcoming exhibition features photographs from the area showcasing the incredible wildlife and landscape ' it 's indicative of how extreme everything is these days			0
' he said he had received over 400 personal messages through his website and @entity20 page since he published the photographs , but had stopped reading them due to the atrocious many of them were			0
@entity8 did emphasise that many people had been positive about the airing of the photos , and he presented them without comment on the original post			2
' i put it out there and did n't tell people what to think of them ' , he said			0
when asked about his take on the sport of killing animals for the sake of it , @entity8 said although he did n't condone it , he also though @entity2 chose a poor park to kill the @entity38 creatures			1
' personally i ’m repulsed by the idea of killing an animal for pleasure , ' he said			0
' my main point is that @entity2 should have done his research before he went to @entity121			2
' on the apology from the sports star , the photographer said : ' he came up with that apology pretty quickly , and it shows			0
' @entity8 also described the invoking of @entity2 's wife @entity129 's death in the actions were in poor taste			1
the photographer grew up in @entity9 , and his upcoming exhibition features photographs from the area showcasing the incredible wildlife and landscape			0
at the weekend former @entity3 test player @entity138 was also dragged into the @entity2 hunting controversy after an image of the pair posing with a dead animal emerged			1

a spokesman for the 38 - year - old confirmed to @entity27 that ' yes , that photo was taken on a farm in @entity9 '			2

@entity2 is a life member with the @entity174 and defended the practice in 2006 , explaining that he sees it as a ' bonding ' activity between himself and his mates			1

' i do have a passion for hunting and it is something i do want to continue once i 've finished with cricket			2
