leading @entity1 figures yesterday demanded that @entity2 face a grilling over torture			1
as the clamour for a judge - led inquiry grew , @entity5 and @entity6 called for the former prime minister to be quizzed on @entity12 ’s role in the barbaric treatment of prisoners by the @entity15			1
it comes as the @entity17 publishes a letter from more than 40 prominent figures , including politicians and authors , calling for @entity22 to secure the release of a @entity12 father of four held for 13 years without trial in @entity26			2
her intervention means the @entity1 front bench is on the verge of supporting an inquiry that could be hugely embarrassing for both mr @entity2 and @entity43 – the brother of the party ’s current leader			0
mps said former foreign secretary @entity28 – who has been interviewed @entity28 – who has been interviewed as a ‘ witness ’ by detectives investigating the rendition of two @entity51 dissidents – must also be held to account			1
last night , former @entity53 attorney general @entity52 backed the calls for a judge - led inquiry once the police investigations are over , saying it was needed to provide ‘ finality ’			1
and former shadow home secretary @entity60 told @entity61 a judge must take charge			0
he said : ‘ one must understand the sheer weight of pressure that comes from the @entity66 to try and stop this sort of stuff coming out , so i think this needs to be a judicial inquiry			1
’ at @entity71 , the weekend was dominated by the continued fallout from last week ’s @entity74 report , which detailed how detainees had been subjected to torture such as waterboarding			2
mr @entity22 continues to cling to the position that an inquiry by @entity80 ’s @entity79 is the best way of finding out the level of @entity12 ’s involvement			1
in a publicity blitz , @entity79 chairman sir @entity84 yesterday said he had asked the @entity74 committee to reveal the redactions , requested by @entity12 security officials , which led to all mention of @entity90 and @entity91 being removed from the 499 - page report			1
sir @entity84 told the @entity94 's @entity93 this morning that he would seek to question former ministers over @entity12 's role or complicity in torture shadow home secretary @entity6 said her ' instinct ' was to call for a full judicial inquiry into @entity12 torture former foreign secretary @entity28 was grilled by police investigating the abductions of two @entity51 dissidents who claim they were handed to colonel @entity107 and tortured by his regime			1
mr @entity28 was interviewed as a ' witness ' by @entity110 amid claims the @entity12 government was complicit in the ' rendition ' of the two men and their families			1
the dissidents , @entity117 and @entity118 , have accused mr @entity28 of signing off on the operations in 2004			0
a decision on whether to lay any charges could be made in the new year			0
he also said his committee would ask any former or serving minister with a contribution to make to give evidence – putting the spotlight firmly on mr @entity2 , mr @entity28 and mr @entity43			2
sir @entity84 added : ‘ if they refuse to do so , that in itself would imply they have something to hide			1
if there is evidence they knew or were involved then of course they would be priority figures for our investigation			2
‘ if people deserve to be embarrassed it ’s our job to embarrass them			0
we have a statutory obligation to carry out this task without fear or favour			0
’ however , he admitted that he had no way of compelling the @entity15 to hand over an uncensored copy of the report			1
he also conceded he could not say he was ‘ confident ’ of success			0
home secretary @entity152 will be grilled today by the @entity153 on the extent of her contact with the @entity74 committee and whether she personally lobbied for any redactions			0
@entity79 member @entity158 said it was right to seek details of redacted material but questioned why it should come from the @entity15			1
he said the priority should be to seek answers directly from the government and intelligence agencies			0
the @entity1 mp added : ‘ it could take months and what we are asking for already exists in @entity171			0
’ miss @entity6 said she doubted the @entity79 ‘ have the capacity and the scope ’ to carry out an inquiry , adding that her ‘ instinct ’ was that a judge - led process would still be required to ensure confidence			0
she told the @entity94 that mr @entity2 and other former ministers had ‘ always said that they would co-operate with all investigations and have said that they would be very keen to do so ’			0
former prime minister @entity2 met the former @entity51 leader @entity107 at his desert base outside @entity183 south of @entity184 in 2007 a parliamentary committee has called on the @entity15 government to hand over any evidence of @entity12 complicity in torture			1
last week a @entity15 @entity74 report exposed the " brutal " treatment of @entity193 terror suspects in the wake of 9/11			2
@entity195 has admitted that some material was removed from the report at the @entity12 's request , for national security reasons			2
but it said no redactions related to @entity12 involvement in the mistreatment of prisoners			0
the @entity205 is conducting an inquiry into the treatment of detainees by @entity12 intelligence agencies in the decade following 9/11			2
sir @entity84 , who heads the intelligence committee , told the @entity94 's @entity93 it would request to see redacted material in the @entity74 's public report if it referenced the @entity12			1
he said that if @entity12 intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were complicit in that torture			2
" that would be quite against all the standards of this country , it would be something that ought to be brought into the public domain , " sir @entity84 added			1
miss @entity6 added that it was important to get to the truth to make sure there was no ‘ shadow of innuendo or allegations cast over the vital work that the [ security ] agencies rightly do to keep us all safe every day of the week ’			0
former home secretary mr @entity5 said mr @entity28 and mr @entity2 should go before the committee			0
asked on the @entity93 show if they should give evidence , he said : ‘ yes , absolutely , yes			0
’ former deputy prime minister @entity237 also called for a judicial inquiry			1
he wrote in his @entity240 column : ‘ we must have a transparent system that reflects our values of fair play and justice , not one that turns a blind eye and deaf ear to claims of the abduction and torture of innocent people			0
’ @entity53 defence secretary @entity252 called for mr @entity28 and mr @entity2 to reveal what they knew about the @entity33 ’s torture and rendition programme when they were in office			1
he said : ‘ obviously it ’s for them , it ’s for former ministers to account for the relationship then			0
i hope they will co-operate with any parliamentary inquiry			0
’ civil liberties groups and campaigning mps accuse @entity12 of repeatedly turning a blind eye to torture during mr @entity2 ’s ‘ war on terror ’ – when he worked hand in glove with the @entity272 administration			2
there are allegations that @entity12 agents were present when torture took place and that the @entity12 helped with rendition flights			2
yesterday , one of the two psychologists who were paid to run the interrogation programme by the @entity33 insisted @entity12 agents were at torture sites			1
dr @entity284 , who devised the brutal ‘ enhanced interrogation ’ programmes , said : ‘ i ’d see their special operations people at the sites i would visit			1
’ @entity291 dem business secretary @entity290 said the @entity79 and police investigations into the @entity51 renditions should be allowed to ‘ run their course ’			0
he added : ‘ if at the end of it , it does n’t appear that the truth is emerging , that people imagine there is some kind of cover - up , then of course a judge - led inquiry is the right way to proceed			0
’ @entity309 of human rights group @entity308 said : ‘ until our government sets up a transparent , judicial inquiry , cover - up and official impunity will persist			1

former @entity315 and foreign secretary face @entity318 grilling over torture
comes after @entity15 report revealed scale of ' enhanced interrogation ' by @entity33
but the report redacted all evidence of @entity12 complicity with the @entity33
it has led to calls for a full judicial inquiry into what the government knew
a parliamentary committee has *launched* a probe of @entity12 complicity
its chairman sir @entity84 said he would call former ministers
