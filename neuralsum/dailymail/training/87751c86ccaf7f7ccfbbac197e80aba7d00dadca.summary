by @entity0 published : 07:43 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 14:40 est , 1 december 2013 some children moan about eating @entity5 sprouts , and the odd curmudgeon is n't partial to @entity8 cake or brandy butter , but most of us are in firm agreement about one thing when it comes to grub served up on 25 december : festive food is jolly delicious			2
a handful of traditional flavour favourites have been given a topsy - turvy makeover by brands , eateries and recipe websites , muddling savoury and sweet to confuse our taste - buds and befuddle any sense of gastronomic order			0
so you 'll find croissants stuffed with turkey and gravy , doughnuts filled with turkey and cranberry , a turkey and sweet potato cake , mince pie - flavoured crisps , mint chocolate chip @entity38 , and both a @entity40 and a cheese that taste remarkably revoltingly of @entity8 lunch			1
sweet cinnamon and mint choc flavour @entity38 are not the first peculiar flavours to have been launched by the brand - @entity47 audiences have also experienced white chocolate , soft - shell crab , blueberry and hazelnut , and seaweed @entity53 , @entity8 editor on @entity56 's lifestyle channel , has compiled a list of this merry season 's most berserk comestibles , which are made both in @entity60 and in @entity47			1
@entity38 have launched the limited edition flavours of sweet cinnamon and mint choc , though these are n't the most bizarre ones the brand have come up with			0
fans in @entity47 have also experienced white chocolate , grilled shrimp , soft - shell crab , seaweed , and blueberry and hazelnut			0
@entity72 cheese has unveiled a seasonal block of cheddar stuffed to bursting with the flavours of @entity8			2
the yellow , turkey - flavoured block is flecked with @entity5 sprouts , grated carrot and bits of dried fruit			1
@entity83 cheese is flavoured with turkey and specked with sprouts , pieces of carrot and festive fruit over in @entity47 , foodie website chow.com has created a recipe for a full @entity92 meal in one slice of cake			1
the meatloaf - style beast comprises layers of mashed turkey , mashed potato , mashed sweet potato and toasted marshmallows			2
not for the faint of heart			0
but if you do n't fancy getting your elbows dirty , @entity103 should head to the @entity107			0
over there the kind - hearted chefs are rustling up @entity92 doughnuts made of spiced pumpkin dough and filled either with turkey and gravy or - for those with a more traditionally sweet tooth when it comes to doughnuts - turkey and cranberry			1
and @entity119 has done the same ... only using croissants instead of doughnuts			0
back in @entity60 , brands including @entity123 , @entity40 and @entity124 have added @entity8 sparkle to some of their products			1
@entity123 's mince pie - flavoured crisps are the perfect gift for any , er , mince pie - lover with a gluten intolerance			1
if you can find it ( it was a limited edition put out some years ago ) , the @entity8 dinner @entity40 would be ideal for any culinarily lazy singleton this yuletide			0
same goes for this snazzy offering from @entity124			0
it 'll be hard to track down as it was only made in 2008 , but if you can , @entity124 's champagne - infused spread will be sure to put the bubbles in your @entity8 morning toast			2
@entity147 , now in cake format , thanks to the inventive people at @entity151 who created a recipe for a meatloaf - style meal of layered turkey and mashed potato topped with sweet potato and burned marshmallows the @entity107 in @entity103 is selling a @entity92 doughnut , a sweet - savoury spiced pumpkin doughnut filled either with turkey and gravy or turkey and cranberry proving that when it comes to @entity92 @entity47 are nothing if not dedicated is this turkey and cranberry croissant made in @entity103 's @entity119 as if mint crisps were n't weird enough , @entity123 have brought out a mince pie flavour as part of their seasonal @entity173 range ... a sort of crispy biscuit thin the @entity176 is perfect for any @entity177 who does n't like cooking , friends or @entity8 to those who love it , @entity124 is already special enough ... but here it is with added @entity8 champagne sparkle , just for fun			1
