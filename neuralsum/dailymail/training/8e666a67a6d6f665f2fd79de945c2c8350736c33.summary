' they thought we were human traffickers , ' @entity7 said			2
' they said we adopted our children to either harvest their organs or to do medical tests on them			2
' i mean , this is an outrageous charge against us - a loving family			0
but the @entity3 authorities just did n't understand multi-ethnic adoption			1
' reunited : the couple appeared with their two adopted sons , @entity38 and @entity39 , at their church in @entity75 , @entity76 on sunday - but they said they felt the absence of their daughter welcomed back : pastor @entity79 led applause for the family during their first public appearance @entity8 added : ' for me , the hardest part , i think , was being asked over and over , " are you the real mom ?
