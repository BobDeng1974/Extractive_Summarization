president @entity0 is urging parents to get their children vaccinated in the face of a measles outbreak that has infected more than 100 people in the @entity6			1
but @entity8 gov. @entity7 , who may run for @entity0 's job next year , insisted on monday that moms and dads deserve ' some measure of choice ' in the matter			1
his press aides scrambled in the late morning hours to contain the political damage , trying to clarify and re-frame what he said while touring a biomedical company in @entity20 , @entity21			0
in an interview taped sunday before the @entity23 but aired on monday 's ' today ' show , @entity0 said measles was a preventable disease			1
' i understand that there are families that in some cases are concerned about the effect of vaccinations , ' he explained			0
' the science is , you know , pretty indisputable			0
we 've looked at this again and again			0
there is every reason to get vaccinated , but there are n't reasons to not			1
' ' you should get your kids vaccinated , ' @entity0 added			2
' science is ... @entity46 ' : @entity0 said in an interview aired monday that parents should vaccinate their children @entity8 governor @entity7 ( right ) and his wife @entity50 ( center ) visited a life science company in @entity20 , @entity21 on monday , where he waded into the global controversy over childhood vaccines a moment of @entity55 , a lifetime of security : vaccines protect against measles , mumps , rubella , tetanus , diphtheria , @entity63 , and a host of other diseases that used to kill countless children @entity7 , a likely @entity67 candidate for president , said monday that parents should have some choice on whether to vaccinate their children			1
@entity7 's comments came after touring the facilities of @entity73 , the manufacturer of the flu vaccine @entity74 , during a three - day trade mission to the @entity77			1
he said he and his wife had vaccinated their children , describing that decision as ' the best expression i can give you of my opinion			2
' doing so is an ' important part of making sure we protect their health and the public health , ' @entity86 added			1
' but it ’s much more important , i think , what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official			0
' ' i also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well			0
so that 's the balance that the government has to decide			0
' ' it depends on what the vaccine is , what the disease type is and all the rest , ' he said			0
' and so i did n't say i 'm leaving people the option			0
what i 'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns			0
' ' not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others			1
so that 's what i mean by that so that i ’m not misunderstood			0
' sensing a backlash , @entity7 's press office sent a statement to reporters on monday morning insisting that he ' believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated			1
' ' at the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination , which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate , ' the statement said			0
all states currently require children to get certain vaccinations to enroll in school , although @entity148 and @entity8 are among 20 states that let parents opt out by obtaining personal belief waivers			1
parents in @entity8 seeking a medical exemption have to submit a written statement from their doctor or registered nurse indicating why the exemption is needed			2
@entity0 also talked with today co-host @entity158 about his legacy in office , ' deflategate ' and the @entity162 terror army his own super bowl : @entity8 gov. @entity7 , right , wearing an @entity166 scarf , sat on sunday with @entity168 president @entity167 in the stands during the @entity171 soccer match between @entity166 and @entity172 at the @entity173 in @entity174 @entity175 ? @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity148 si the epicenter of a measles outbreak which , so far , has n't killed anyone the @entity181 vaccine likely saves tens of thousands of lives each year there have been 91 measles cases in @entity148 , with at least 58 of those epidemiologically linked to a cluster that began at @entity175 in december			1
more than a dozen other cases have been confirmed in 13 other @entity6 states and in @entity189			0
no deaths have been reported in connection with the outbreak , which public health officials suspect began when an infected person from outside the @entity6 visited @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity148 , between dec. 15 and dec. 20			1
the measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so - called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines , fueled by now - debunked research suggesting a link to autism , have led a small minority of parents to refuse to allow their children to be inoculated			1
some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated for religious or other reasons			1
@entity210 stars including @entity211 and @entity212 have urged parents to rethink vaccines , pointing to what they say is an increase in diagnosed cases of autism			1
@entity211 now insists she 's not stritcly against vaccinations – but objects to the compressed schedule along with governments recommend they be applied			2
@entity0 said the larger the group of unvaccinated people , the more vulnerable it made small infants and people who can not get vaccinations because of health issues			2
health nut : satellite radio host and former @entity229 centerfold model @entity211 insists she 's not opposed to all childhood vaccines , but her reputation as the queen of the ' anti-vax ' movement is solid @entity212 ( right ) believes ' there are very scary statistics out there regarding what is in vaccines and what they cause ' ; theories about a rise in autism diagnoses connected to childhood vaccinations have been widely debunked in thousands of cases each year , vaccinated children who are later treated with radiation for leukemia and other cancers find themselves lacking antibodies that fight off communicable diseases			1
those children can be at increased health risk if they are around others who have n't been vaccinated			2
the measles - mumps - rubella vaccine , commonly called the @entity181 , is 97 percent effective at preventing measles , according to the @entity256			2
@entity8 requires @entity181 vaccines for children between 12 and 15 months , and then a second at between 4 and 6 years			2
the @entity259 says doctors should bring up the importance of vaccinations during visits , but should respect a parent 's wishes unless there 's a significant risk to the child			0
' in general , pediatricians should avoid discharging patients from their practices solely because a parent refuses to immunize his or her child , ' according to guidelines issued by the group			0
@entity277 is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air , with symptoms that include fever , runny nose and a blotchy rash			0
the current outbreak originated at @entity286 theme parks last month , and @entity189 and at least six other @entity6 states have recorded measles cases connected to @entity175 .			0

so - called ' anti-vaccination ' movement has raised the issue over and over , with @entity210 figures like @entity211 and @entity212 drawing fire for their views
@entity0 says ' there is every reason to get vaccinated , but there are n't reasons to not '
some parents , though , opt out in states like @entity148 and @entity8 where they *'re* allowed to , for religious or other reasons
@entity8 gov. @entity7 *stepped* into the debate monday in the @entity77 , saying not all vaccines are created equal and parents ' rights have to be balanced against public health
