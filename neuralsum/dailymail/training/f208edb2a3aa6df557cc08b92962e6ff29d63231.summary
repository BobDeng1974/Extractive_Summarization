by @entity0 published : 16:59 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 18:45 est , 2 july 2012 under scrutiny : @entity2 prepared a paper with former colleagues at the bank @entity5 headed ' @entity6 ' leaked documents last night brought the interest - rate fixing scandal that has shaken @entity11 's banks closer to the heart of the last @entity14 government			1
they suggest that @entity2 , a former cabinet office minister and one of @entity14 's chief economic advisers , told officials in 2008 that bringing down the rates which determine how much banks lend to each other would be ' a major contribution to the stability of the banking system and to the health of the economy '			2
a paper prepared by the peer with former colleagues at the bank @entity5 was headed ' @entity6 ' â€“ the name for the inter-bank lending rate at the centre of the scandal			1
the document was circulated among officials and @entity38 's ministerial colleagues at the height of the credit crunch in 2008 and concludes : ' getting libor down is desirable			1
' but the briefing note was prepared only days after @entity43 boss @entity42 , who is fighting to save his job after traders at the bank were revealed to have made millions by fixing the rate , discussed the issue with @entity50 deputy governor @entity49			1
on another dramatic day in the unfolding scandal : denial : the @entity50 has been forced to deny it was aware that bankers were manipulating the rate the @entity50 has been forced to deny it was aware that bankers were manipulating the rate , which affects how much customers pay for mortgages and credit cards			1
@entity43 traders are said to have ' mistakenly ' believed they were operating under instruction from the bank when they fiddled the figures			1
@entity38 said last night there had been widespread concern , including in government , about @entity6 figures but insisted that was ' very different ' to issues of alleged market manipulation			0
what discussions bank bosses had with officials from the @entity50 , and senior figures in government , over @entity6 will form a central part of a @entity79 - style inquiry announced last night by @entity80 and chancellor @entity81			1
labour leader @entity82 has insisted that only a full - scale public inquiry led by a senior judge will do , and is considering refusing to co-operate with the @entity86 probe			1
mr @entity82 said politicians investigating bankers would not command the confidence of the @entity11 people			2
@entity38 's leaked note , from november 2008 , suggests concern about reducing the rate was shared by senior figures in the @entity14 government , and specifically mentions the high rates being posted by @entity43 , @entity97 and @entity98			1
the peer and her co-authors say the price of credit in the real economy is ' heavily @entity6 influenced ' and that bringing the rate down was critical to ' rebuilding the health of a banking system '			2
@entity6 is the average cost of borrowing for banks , calculated every day using submissions from a number of selected banks			0
it is used to price huge numbers of loans and financial products across the world			0
@entity38 's note discusses reducing the fees on government lending schemes to banks as a way of trying to cut their borrowing costs , and there is no suggestion the peer was aware that traders went on to fiddle the rate			2
but the document adds to growing evidence of concern about keeping @entity6 low among the authorities of the day			0
the parliamentary inquiry is likely to focus on how and whether that concern was communicated to bank bosses , and how they responded			0
conservative mp @entity134 , a member of the treasury select committee , said : ' this document appears to show that senior figures in the last government were highly concerned about ways of reducing @entity6 at the height of the financial crisis			0
the question is whether and how that was passed on to the banks			0
' that issue , and the relationship between the @entity50 and @entity43 , will need to be looked at closely by the parliamentary inquiry			1
' mr @entity81 , in a @entity148 clash with @entity14 's @entity149 , whose former ministerial duties included regulating the @entity151 , asked : ' did he express any concerns about the @entity6 rate when @entity154 was prime minister ? we will find out in due course			1
' conservative mp @entity157 , a former banker , said the revelations about @entity6 were likely to be the tip of the iceberg			0
she said : ' you know , if @entity6 has been manipulated , and abused , and lied about , what other potential areas of the inter-bank markets have been rigged ? ' gilt auctions , for example , other liquidity schemes that the @entity50 's put in place			0
i certainly think that all banks and regulators need to be considering what scope there is for fraud to have been committed			0
' i must admit , as a former banker and having kind of made the case for the industry over a while , i was pretty shocked at this new low			0
' a spokesman for @entity179 said : ' like everyone else , government was very concerned about the price of credit to small and medium - sized enterprises despite record low interest rates			2
that is obviously different to any issue of alleged market manipulation by banks			0
