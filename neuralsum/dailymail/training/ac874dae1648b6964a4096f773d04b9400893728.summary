by @entity0 and @entity1 swindler : @entity3 is reportedly renting a $ 4 million beachfront mansion in @entity5 , despite owing nearly $ 100 million to his victims @entity3 's life story skyrocketed to the top of the box office , but the meteoric rise has n't outrun his current reality			1
the @entity14 government has moved to take control of two @entity16 , @entity5 , mansions said to possibly be owned by 51 - year - old @entity17 he has long - insisted he rents			1
documents obtained by @entity20 show the feds action is an attempt to claw back more money towards the $ 110million restitution owed by the convicted con artist			1
previous reports suggested that at least one of the homes is worth a cool $ 4million			1
the report comes only days after news that @entity31 , based in @entity32 , obtained a judgment against @entity3 for $ 27,597 from unpaid retail purchases @entity3 made during the height of his hedonistic lifestyle in the 1990s , reports @entity20			1
@entity3 temporarily avoided paying that judgement by fleeing to glitzy @entity38 , where he reportedly rents another glamorous mansion			1
the collection agency has since filed new legal documents to make their @entity32 judgment enforceable in @entity5			2
the former stockbroker was ordered to pay $ 110.4 million in restitution to his victims as part of his sentencing in 2003 , but so far , he has paid just $ 11.6 million - and most of that came from sales of his property			2
the staggering sum was agreed to as part of his punishment for running the @entity61 - based ' boiler room ' brokerage @entity59 alongside co-defendant @entity62			0
the pair and others made their millions by ' pumping and dumping ' shares after high - pressure sales calls to investors led them to unwittingly buy the stocks - causing their price to rise - allowing @entity3 and co to dump them at a large profit			2
they raked in a known $ 200million from the fraud , which they spent on cocaine , prostitutes and a yacht once owned by @entity79			0
the @entity80 caught up with them in 1996 , and @entity3 eventually spent 22 months in prison			2
@entity62 was sentenced to 39 months			0
@entity3 , who is the inspiration behind @entity86 's @entity85 , in which he is played by @entity87 , is now being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his infamous party lifestyle in the 1990s @entity3 has written a pair of memoirs detailing his past misdeeds , @entity91 of @entity92 in 2008 and 2009 's catching the @entity85			1
the first was named after a nickname given to @entity3 after a magazine article profiling his firm - which even handled the initial public offering for @entity101 's shoe company			2
@entity101 also did time in jail on securities fraud charges stemming from the @entity59 investigation			0
@entity105 paid @entity3 $ 1.045 million for the rights to his best seller story in 2011			1
but @entity3 paid only $ 21,000 in restitution that year , according to the government			1
he has claimed many times , including during a contentious interview on ' @entity112 , ' that he has never profited from the book or the movie , and that he has paid much more towards the restitution than was required			0
' i am not making any royalties off the film or the books , and i am totally content with that			0
my income comes from new life , which is far better than my old one , ' @entity3 wrote on his @entity125 page on december 29			2
' for the record , i am not turning over 50 % of the profits of the books and the movie , which was what the government had wanted me to do			0
instead , i insisted on turning over 100 % of the profits of both books and the movie , which is to say , i am not making a single dime on any of this			0
this should amount to countless millions of dollars and hopefully be more than enough to pay back anyone who is still out there , ' he added			0
new career : the former stockbroker owes victims $ 110 million and should be paying 50 per cent of his income as a public speaker in restitution prosecutors say @entity3 is living off book royalties , the money from the film rights and fees from his burgeoning career as a motivational speaker			1
in addition , say prosecutors , @entity3 has skipped the country to @entity157 , complicating the government 's efforts to track his income			2
' we want to set the record straight , ' @entity160 , a spokesman for the @entity14 attorney for the @entity162 in @entity163 told the @entity166			0
' @entity3 's making these claims , and they 're not factual			0
he 's in @entity157 and using that loophole to avoid paying			0
' ' the government has seen nothing to suggest that even 100 per cent of @entity3 's profits from his book and the movie @entity85 would yield , in his words , " countless millions , " much less the approximately $ 100 million that is still owed to the victims , ' he said			1
@entity3 's lawyer denies that charge , saying his client traveled to @entity157 for work reasons but lives in @entity38 , @entity5			1
dispute : prosecutors say @entity3 and his partner have relocated to @entity157 to avoid paying back what he owes , but his lawyer says the pair are based in @entity5 @entity3 's @entity125 page tells a different story : photographs appear on his page dated from april 10 2013 through may and june			1
he then appears to head to @entity191 and @entity192 before arriving back in @entity157 in november , where he 's apparently spent most of his time up until now			0
his most recent posts appear to come from and be centered around @entity157			0
the @entity14 government contends that @entity3 must continue to pay 50 per cent of his income in restitution , but @entity3 's lawyer says he is no longer obligated to comply with the court - ordered payment plan because his supervised release period is now over			1
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity201 , told the @entity166 that his client has paid every restitution payment he owes			1
' he 's made payments as he was required to make payments and as he earned income , ' said @entity201			0
' he has never run from his obligations			0

@entity3 still owes more than $ *100million* in restitution stemming from a plea deal struck for *crimes* *dramatized* in the box office smash
he has reportedly been living in *luxury* beachfront homes in @entity5
the con artist is also being hunted by creditors who are chasing debts from his 1990s party days
