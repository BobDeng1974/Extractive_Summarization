circumcised men may soon be able to undergo a procedure to re-grow their foreskin			1
a @entity4 company says it is close to developing a method that will allow men ’s foreskins to regenerate – much like a salamander is able to re-grow a limb , the website @entity11 reports			1
the procedure will help the growing number of men aggrieved about being circumcised before they had the capacity to consent to the procedure			1
these men - who call themselves ‘ intactivists ’ - are becoming increasingly vocal with their outrage at being circumcised			1
a @entity4 company claims it may soon be able to regrow a human foreskin , which will help the increasing number of men who are aggrieved about being circumcised , claiming it has reduced sensitivity ( file image ) many of them are congregating on forums on websites such as foreskin - restoration.net and @entity33 , angry that their foreskins were removed before they were old enough to consent or understand the implications of the procedure			1
many complain that they experience de-sensitivity in the head of the penis and can not enjoy sex in the same way as their non-circumcised peers			0
medical experts are increasingly divided over whether circumcision should be performed			0
while some argue there is a wealth of research showing the health benefits , from a reduced risk of sexually transmitted diseases to penile cancer , critics argue circumcision can cause lifelong trauma , diminish sexual satisfaction and put children at risk of lasting physical damage			0
in many of the ‘ intactivist ’ forums , men discuss options and methods of reversing the procedure			1
now , one company purports it will soon be able to do just that , reports journalist @entity69 for @entity11			1
regeneration is carried out by creating an extra-cellular matrix , a ‘ skeleton ’ for tissue which provides an attachment point for cells and makes human tissue 3d			1
this extra-cellular matrix is then seeded with the appropriate layer of cells , in this case , stem cells that will grow into foreskin			2
@entity84 says it will draw together experts from the field to find a way to make men ’s foreskin grow back			1
it will start with experiments on animals with a view to progressing to trials on humans			0
in 2013 , the company had its first ' breakthrough ' and was able to ' decellularize ' bull foreskins - a process which marks the first step towards re-growing the bull ’s foreskin			1
an organ donation organisation has now given @entity84 the permission to acquire human adult foreskins – and they will carry out the same experiments on these			2
so far , while they may be close to regrowing foreskin tissue , it is unclear how they will regenerate peripheral nerves			1
writing on its website , @entity84 said : ‘ in the short term , we hope to fully regenerate human foreskins			1
‘ once we have accomplished that , our goal is to advance onto human clinical trials as soon as it is safe to do so			2
’ it says the newly grown foreskin will be fully functioning , as the new tissue reintegrates itself in the body			2
this means the body recognises it as its own tissue and will not reject it , as is the case for transplanted organs or grafted skin			0
it claims not only to be able to ‘ re-grow ’ the removed tissue , but it will also be fully functioning , restoring sensitivity			2
@entity84 , is a @entity4 non-profit organisation ‘ founded to research and implement regenerative medical therapies for circumcised males ’ , its website says			1
it points to research which found that circumcision leads to loss of sensation in the penis , as well as the potential for psychological damage			0
the company , based in @entity149 , is researching techniques used in regenerative medicine , a branch of medicine which helps people re-grow tissue that has been lost by injury or disease			1
like salamanders , humans naturally have the ability to regenerate while developing in the womb			2
if a foetus loses a finger , it grows back without forming scar tissue			0
it is not known why humans lose the ability to regenerate , but one theory is that the process of scarring – which prevents bleeding – was considered during human evolution to be more important			1
experts working in regenerative medicine have discovered ways of harnessing the ‘ map of the body ’ present in cells ’ dna , which allows any part of the body to be regrown , and to inhibit scarring			0
so far , scientists and doctors have been able to partially regenerate living human hearts , vaginal tissue , breast tissue as well as fully regenerating bladders and the last joint of a human finger			1
scientists have also been able to regrow functioning penises in rabbits			2
regeneration is carried out by creating an extra-cellular matrix , a ‘ skeleton ’ for tissue which provides an attachment point for cells and makes human tissue 3d			2
this extra-cellular matrix is then seeded with the appropriate layer of cells , in this case , stem cells that will grow into foreskin			2
growing numbers of men are calling themselves ' intactivists ' and are angry at being circumcised as an infant before they could consent to the procedure			1

medical experts are increasingly divided over whether circumcision should be performed circumcision has been practised for centuries , with the earliest evidence dating from the time of the pharaohs			0
yet it has become a highly controversial procedure , and one that stirs strong passions			0
late last year , the @entity278 ( @entity278 ) - @entity4 's leading public health organisation , recently issued draft guidelines recommending the procedure for all boys			1
experts there argued that circumcision protects against the risk of urinary tract infections in infants and sexually transmitted diseases in adulthood			0
this may be because it reduces the risk of bacteria lodging within the foreskin and reduces the risk of tiny tears to the foreskin that become an entry point for infections			0
the @entity278 guidelines also suggest that circumcision lowers the risk of men contracting herpes and the human papilloma virus , in turn protecting them against penile cancer - and cutting the risk of their passing the virus on to women , reducing their risk of cervical cancer			1
the @entity278 concluded that ' the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks of physical or mental harm that may be involved '			0
those in the ' no ' camp say all this is based on flawed studies from @entity323 that have no relevance to @entity326 populations			0
furthermore it ignores research that shows no link between circumcision and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases			0
over the past five years , doctors ' groups in @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 and @entity341 have spoken out against the procedure			0
their various national organisations have called for bans on the op unless it is needed on strictly medical grounds			0
the @entity347 recently passed a resolution condemning the practice as a ' violation of the physical integrity of children '			0
it said circumcision can cause lifelong trauma , diminish sexual satisfaction and put children at risk of lasting physical damage			0
and while the @entity360 advocates circumcision in regions with high levels of heterosexual @entity366 transmission - such as in @entity323 - it also warns that it can cause pain , excessive bleeding , excessive skin removal , scars and deformation			0
last month , @entity373 's most senior family judge , sir @entity372 , said male circumcision involved ' significant harm ' .			0

growing number of men are angry at being circumcised as an infant
they call themselves ' intactivists ' and say procedure led to *insensitivity*
@entity4 company is now researching methods to regrow a human foreskin
hopes to regenerate foreskin much like a salamander can re-grow a limb
