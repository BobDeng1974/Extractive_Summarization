by @entity0 @entity1 will only rejoin @entity2 if the @entity4 club match the personal terms on offer elsewhere			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity10 side @entity9 have all tabled concrete offers for the 30 - year - old free agent			1
@entity1 ’s preference , however , is to return to @entity4 after a four - year absence and a deal could be struck to in the coming days provided his former employer can up the offer they made him late last week			1
fans ' favourite : former striker @entity1 ( right ) is ready to make a popular return to @entity2 predator : @entity1 ( right ) scored 22 goals for @entity24 in the @entity26 last season the former @entity24 man looked to be heading to @entity28 a week ago after @entity2 stalled on a deal			1
the @entity4 club belatedly re-entered the race for his signature over the weekend but , as things stand , that deal will need to be improved upon in order to reunite him with @entity36			0
@entity1 became the @entity26 ’s top scorer with 167 strikes after joining his boyhood heroes from @entity24 in 2006			0
he left to join @entity40 in 2010 , then had spells at @entity42 , @entity43 in @entity44 and @entity45 in the @entity46 before returning to @entity47 in february			0
@entity1 ’s goals helped keep @entity24 in the @entity49 and now it looks like his partnership with @entity36 will for the basis of @entity2 ’ push for promotion			1
@entity8 boss @entity55 has all but conceded defeat in the battle to land the striker			0
‘ i think if @entity2 make @entity1 an offer then financially it would beat our offer , ’ he said			2
‘ if it is n’t @entity1 , then we move on			0
if @entity1 decides he wants to come to @entity8 , then we will do a deal but we ca n’t stand about waiting for that to happen			2
‘ we still have other options to look at as well			0

@entity1 was *due* to sign for @entity8 but @entity2 look set to *swoop*
