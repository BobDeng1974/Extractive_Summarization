by @entity0 published : 05:28 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 19:46 est , 9 january 2013 the @entity1 was accused of attempting to ' bury bad news ' last night after belatedly publishing a dossier acknowledging that it has failed to meet dozens of promises			0
a 119 - page audit lists all 400 pledges made when the government was formed in 2010 , and assesses its progress on each			1
the document was produced as an annexe to the @entity1 's ' mid-term review ' , which was published on monday , but was not mentioned during a joint appearance by @entity13 and @entity14 on monday			1
@entity13 was forced to defend the decision to delay publishing the audit of coalition policies at @entity19 's questions , with @entity21 leader @entity20 accusing him of ' broken promises ' it only came to light when a @entity26 aide was photographed carrying another paper , marked ' restricted ' , discussing whether or not the annexe should be published			1
it suggested the release of the audit should be delayed , given that a focus on broken promises risked overshadowing favourable media coverage			2
it also warned that the document might be seen as ' self - congratulatory ' , given that it claims the overwhelming majority of commitments – around 90 per cent – have been met			1
the document , published hastily yesterday after its existence was revealed , admits some failures , but glosses over others and does not divide promises clearly into those which have and have not been met			0
it notes that a planned badger cull had been ' postponed ' , a free vote on repealing the hunting ban has ' not yet been taken forward ' , accused rapists have not been given anonymity , and , after pledging to cancel a third runway at @entity49 , the government is now ' looking at all the options '			0
the document also concedes that the government has failed to introduce elections to the @entity54 , increase renewable energy targets and create a single financial crime agency , which were all included in the original @entity1 deal in 2010			2
on marriage tax breaks , a flagship @entity60 commitment , it restates that the @entity62 , who object to the move , will be allowed to abstain when mps come to vote on the issue			0
@entity21 accused the @entity1 of an ' astonishing ' omission as the audit failed to mention @entity70 's pledge in his emergency budget of 2010 to ensure that debt is falling as a share of gdp by 2015 - 16			1
instead , it said the government was ' on course ' to deliver a balanced structural budget by the end of a rolling , five - year forecast period			0
the prime minister said the document offered a ' full , frank and completely unvarnished ' assessment of how the @entity1 has performed			1
he told @entity65 : ' we said we would cut the deficit , it 's down by 25 per cent			0
we said we would cut immigration , it 's down by 25 per cent			0
' we said we would rebalance the economy , one million private sector jobs			0
that is a record to be proud of			0
' but at the first prime minister 's questions of the year , @entity21 leader @entity20 branded mr @entity13 ' a pr man who ca n't even do a relaunch '			1
@entity21 vice-chairman @entity96 added : ' this document highlights all the failures and broken promises and it is no wonder that @entity13 and @entity14 have sought to suppress this audit			2
' mr @entity13 's official spokesman said the audit had not been ready for publication alongside the mid-term review on monday simply because the process of ' copper bottoming ' its accuracy had not been completed			2
@entity14 and @entity13 launched the coalition 's @entity108 on monday , but have been warned against being ' self - congratulatory ' about an audit of policy successes to date the existence of the audit of broken promises was revealed after @entity115 , a key advisor to the pm , was photographed carrying restricted documents while going into @entity118 @entity26 the 36,000 - word document detailing progress made in implementing the coalition agreement will admit dropping @entity122 and giving rape suspects anonymity on monday the government published the @entity108 setting out policies to last until 2015 , with mr @entity13 and mr @entity14 insisting in the foreword that their resolve is ' unwavering '			1
