@entity0 has launched a defence of the much - maligned @entity2 and called it ‘ stupid ’ to suggest @entity3 are not intent on winning the competition			1
@entity6 managers have often hinted that @entity9 football ’s second - tier tournament is a nuisance clogging the fixture list , but @entity0 believes @entity12 thrives on such nights			1
@entity3 claimed their first league victory of the season and now welcome @entity16 to @entity17 on thursday as they make their way through seven matches in 23 days			1
@entity0 has launched a defence of the @entity2 and claimed @entity3 are aiming to win it ‘ last year we had to work so hard for 38 games to achieve that , it would be nonsense to say we do n’t want to be giving it everything we ’ve got , ’ he said			1
‘ as long as people understand that making changes to the line - up does n’t mean you do n’t care about a competition			2
we really want to go all the way in the @entity2			1
’ @entity34 and @entity36 side @entity35 are also in @entity37 ‘ we ’re excited because those teams will bring a completely different tactical approach and we will benefit from that , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ @entity3 have to be in @entity9			1
it is a priority for us			2
maybe we were not ready for the @entity42 , even though we fought hard to get into it			1
this is the perfect next step for us			0
’ @entity47 scored for @entity3 against @entity48 , with whom he spent a season on loan for @entity52 , the landscape is more modest			1
@entity48 ’s new head coach is still searching for his first win , and after @entity47 and @entity55 scored , he had to endure jeers from his own fans			1
but @entity52 asked for time as he tries to mould together a squad which has 11 new faces			0
@entity61 and @entity62 came on for their debuts but @entity65 is yet to play because of injury			0
‘ you ca n’t throw a team together overnight , ’ he said			0
‘ but i understand that you ca n’t lose games too often , and that if you do , then it becomes extremely difficult			0
@entity72 forward @entity55 doubled @entity3 's lead in the second half at the @entity75 ' i ’ll keep working to get the lads gelled into the best team we can be as quickly as possible			1
’ captain @entity80 was booed by sections of @entity48 supporters as he was substituted in unsavoury scenes reminiscent of last season			2
‘ it is ridiculous that somebody who has been an incredible servant to this club gets that , ’ raged @entity85 , at fault for @entity55 ’s goal			0
‘ we need our supporters to support us			0
