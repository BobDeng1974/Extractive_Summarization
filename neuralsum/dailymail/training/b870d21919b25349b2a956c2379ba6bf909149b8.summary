@entity7 , who lives alone , fed the cats which she had had since they were kittens , on chips and onion gravy which she bought from her local fish and chip shop with her disability payments			1
filthy conditions : the terrified cats lived locked in a prison - like shed in @entity7 's garden in @entity8 al - cat - traz : the cats lived surrounded by chicken wire and inch - deep in their own filth in @entity7 's shed @entity7 , 60 , kept the cats locked in a filthy shed behind her terraced house in @entity8 , near @entity9 when @entity4 inspectors raided her home after a tip - off , they found every surface of the shed including the window - sills caked in faeces , maggots and dead flies , while the cats huddled together on a fithy table			1
and when they tried to pick up the cats , the animals were so frightened of being handled by humans that they tried to scratch their rescuers			0
all had multiple chronic infections and are now in an @entity4 safehouse where they are recovering			2
it is feared the cats may have been kept inside the shed for up to three years in what the animal welfare organisation called ‘ some of the worst conditions they have ever seen			2
’ details of the case emerged at @entity55 , where prosecutor , @entity56 , said : ' initially the @entity4 had difficulty accessing the property or ramshackle shed in which the cats were housed			1
' after a number of hours , and with assistance from the police , they entered the shed and the inspector was shocked by the conditions they found , stating they were " some of the worst conditions they had seen cats kept in "			2
' the inspector could not stay very long inside as conditions were so bad			0
' the vet who examined the cats said that he could not remember a single animal suffering from so many infections at the same time in all his 30 years as a vet , ' mr @entity56 added : ' the vet noted that by nature cats are clean and meticulous animals and these cats were found living , breathing and walking in their own dirt			2
' this has led to mental suffering in which they were frightened and confused			0
' stench : one @entity4 inspector said the smell was so bad , she could n't stay in the shed longer than 10 minutes maggots : this photograph shows the extent of the filth in which the six cats were forced to live ' chips and onion gravy , their food , remained on the floor			1
the handover was only achieved with some difficulty because the cats were clearly not used to being handled			0
all six cats were found to be frightened			0
@entity7 , who later denied she had kept her cats in such an unsanitary environment , admitted causing unnecessary suffering to six cats			1
in addition to the 15 - year ban on keeping animals , which means @entity7 will lose her pet bearded dragon which she kept inside her house , she was also given a curfew from 8pm until 7am for 16 weeks			1
she was also ordered to pay costs of £ 500 and a victim surcharge of £ 60 , and will not be able to appeal the ban on keeping all animals for 10 years			2

' she has been in floods of tears and these are serious matters			0
she is a lady who is ashamed to find herself in court at this time in her life			0
' but @entity4 inspector @entity140 , who attended the scene , said : ' i hope never to see animals kept in such appalling conditions again			0
i could n’t stay in that shed for more than 10 minutes because the smell was so bad			0
