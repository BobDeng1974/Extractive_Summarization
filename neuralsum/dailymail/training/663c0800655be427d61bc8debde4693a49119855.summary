a landowner is selling one of the @entity3 's most famous peaks for £ 1.75m - and is hoping ' some daft @entity4 ' will come along and take it off his hands			1
lord @entity6 , the eight @entity7 , is flogging the 3,000ft @entity9 mountain in a bid to pay off a £ 9m inheritance bill			1
but the 64 - year - old , who lives there with his third wife @entity14 , admits he needs some ' show off ' to buy the iconic peak - because any prospective buyer wo n't be able to do anything with it			2
lord @entity6 , the eighth @entity7 , pictured with his wife @entity14 , is selling @entity9 mountain in the @entity3 for £ 1.75m the iconic mountain , commonly known as the @entity9 , is being sold - complete with a ceremonial lordship - to help pay off a £ 9m inheritance tax bill speaking to the @entity23 , @entity7 said : ' who 's got the money ? we know the @entity27 have got it , and the @entity4 have got it			1
' we 're hoping there will be some daft @entity4 ( who wants it ) to show off			1
' the aristocrat , whose family has owned the peak for 400 years , has already sold a @entity37 painting , a derelict farm standing and a couple of vacant cottages to try and reduce his inheritance tax bill			1
but with just 18 months to pay every penny , @entity7 decided it was time to sell the peak - with a ceremonial lordship title chucked in for free			1
despite its stark beauty and prime location , @entity7 knows selling the peak will be hard work			1
as it is part of the @entity3 , which is in @entity53 , any buyer will be unable to develop or build on the peak			0
@entity7 , 64 , said he can think of ' better things to spend his money on ' but hopes ' some daft @entity4 ' will want the mountain so they can ' show off ' the new owner will also be unable to do anything about the thousands of walkers who cross the peak each year			1
lord @entity7 admits he can ' think of better things ' to spend his money on , but hopes an extravagant international might feel otherwise			1
if his wish for a ' daft @entity4 ' does not come true , @entity7 hopes the government or @entity66 will step in instead			1
he told the paper : ' once the duties are gone , i can have a better way of life			0
i can go and buy myself a super yacht in the south of @entity74 or a house in the @entity76			0
why not ? the mountain , one of the most renowned landmarks in the @entity81 national park , would still be protected from development even if it is sold a favourite among tourists and walkers , is only the second mountain to be put on the market , after @entity88 in 1998 estate agent @entity89 said he hoped someone would buy it , in the same way someone might buy a ' stunning piece of artwork ' ' we can still walk on it , and fly over it , and do what the hell we like with it			2
it 's not going anywhere			0
' lord @entity7 inherited the peak , which covers an area of 2,676 acres , from his father in 2006			2
the iconic mountain is commonly known as @entity9 , due to the distinctive drop from its peak			1
on a clear day , it gives view over to the @entity111 and @entity112			0
but lord @entity7 is still embarking on new ground			0
@entity9 is only the second mountain to be put on the market , since @entity88 went up for sale in 1998			2
the peak , which has six separate fell tops , has been in the @entity6 family for 400 years covering nearly 2,700 acres , the mountain gives stunning views , sometimes as far - reaching as the @entity111 and @entity112 it will not have a for sale sign to alert potential buyers , but the mountain will be advertised in a glossy brochure , before being bought under sealed bids			2
@entity7 , who has several lordships under his belt , is also selling the lordship of the manor of @entity132 - a ceremonial title , dating back to the 18th century - to go with the mountain			2
@entity89 , managing director of @entity135 , said : ' it is one of the biggest tourist destinations in this country			0
he said : ' we hope someone will buy it in the way they would buy a stunning piece of art work			0
but instead of a picture of the landscape you are getting the real thing			0
lord @entity7 said he will still ' walk on it , fly over it and do what the hell we like with it ' when he sells the iconic peak lord @entity7 says he plans to buy a super yacht in the south of @entity74 or a house in the @entity76 once he sells @entity9 ' the mountain features in the @entity162 mountain guides			1
it is a unique opportunity to own something so unusual			0
' it is the stand out mountain in the @entity3 , with a truly beautiful landscape			0
' the @entity6 family have a long history and @entity7 's father , who was the seventh generation to own the land , inherted the estate in 1953 , aged 39			2
@entity9 's reputation as a tourist attraction has its roots in the 18th century , when people would travel by horseback or carriage along the new @entity180 to @entity181 turnpike road to enjoy the spectacular views			0
it was also a favourite of the fell - walker and guide book author @entity162 .			0
