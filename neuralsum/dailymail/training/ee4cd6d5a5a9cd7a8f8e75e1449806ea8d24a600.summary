@entity0 , 14 , from @entity1 , was born with multiple heart defects while most teenagers have been looking forward to the start of the summer holiday , @entity0 has been desperate to get back to school			1
last term , all he could manage were a couple of mornings a week - and even then , his mother @entity9 made sure he travelled by taxi			2
@entity0 , 14 , rolls his eyes with the frustration of it all			1
he and @entity9 share an incredibly close relationship but he just wants to be with his friends			0
more than anything , he wants to be ' normal '			0
but life for @entity0 is far from normal			1
born with a life - limiting heart condition , @entity0 was having palliative care at home when , at the age of six , he was thrown a lifeline			1
in 2006 , he received a heart transplant at @entity24			1
this gave him eight brilliant years of childhood that his mother thought he would never see			1
but now , unbearably , just as he is getting ready to spread his wings , his donor heart is failing and he desperately needs another			1
in december , @entity0 could still walk five minutes round the corner to see his grandfather			1
now his condition has deteriorated to the point where he can no longer climb the stairs			2
the shortest burst of exercise could cause a cardiac arrest , which both frightens him and makes him angry			0
when he was put back on the transplant list in may , he was warned the chances of finding a suitable donor were slim			1
as the @entity42 has highlighted , there is a chronic shortage of donor organs for all ages			2
currently , 256 people are waiting for hearts , 32 of them children , and one in five will die waiting			0
the fact that @entity0 has already had one transplant presents extra complications : not only does he have his own antibodies but the donor 's , too , which doubles the risk of rejection			1
' this time , @entity0 understands everything that 's happening , ' says @entity9			1
' at his last appointment he asked the team : " are you going to let me die ? " ' outwardly , @entity9 seems calm , but it 's just a shell she has developed to hide the emotional storm raging underneath			0
she checks on @entity0 three times a night , placing her hand on his chest to make sure he 's breathing			1
' i feel we 've been fighting this war for ever , ' she says			0
and there are few places to turn to for support			0
she is a member of a heart transplant @entity75 group but , as she explains : ' we 've had three children in the group die in a fortnight			1
when you hear of another death you want to be sick , then you think , " i do n't want to know "			0
' @entity0 was born by emergency caesarean at @entity84 on april 4 , 1999 , weighing an apparently healthy 8lb 1oz			1
but his heart rate was sky - high and he was diagnosed with a list of problems			1
he had anatomically corrected transposition of the great arteries - meaning the main two arteries were plumbed into the wrong chambers of his heart			1
as a result , the blood being pumped around his body was too low in oxygen to supply the body 's demands , while too much oxygenated blood was going to his lungs			0
@entity0 pictured recovering after his heart transplant aged six he also had @entity103 , where an extra electrical connection in his heart made it beat abnormally fast			1
it would often reach 289 ( for a child under one , from 80 - 160 is normal ) , which meant he was at constant risk of cardiac arrest , where the heart stops pumping			1
' i cried for a whole year when @entity113 was born , ' recalls @entity9			2
' and then i thought : " i need to pull myself together now , because this is our normal "			0
but while the doctors kept having meetings , nothing seemed to be getting better and , inside my head , i was planning his funeral			0
his problems were so complex , no one knew what his life expectancy was			2
' @entity9 was told that when he was bigger , at some point @entity0 would need surgery to place a band on the artery that was allowing too much blood to flow into his lungs , as this would permanently damage the blood vessels			1
meanwhile , @entity0 struggled - he would barely feed and did n't reach the normal developmental milestones , such as rolling over and sitting up when he should ; his skin was grey as his heart struggled to pump enough oxygenated blood into his system			1
@entity0 's father , unable to cope with the shock of having such a sick baby , left @entity9 and @entity0 's older brother @entity142 , now 17			1
during his first two years , @entity0 spent more time in @entity84 than at home , and there were frequent emergency dashes			1
' normally , @entity0 's heart rate was 120 beats per minute but i could tell when it was going up by watching the vein that pulsed in his neck , ' @entity9 says			1
' if it went over 200 bpm - a sign of supraventricular tachycardia ( a dangerously fast heartbeat ) - i 'd call an ambulance ; we were in the children 's ward every week			1
' there , staff would put ice packs over @entity0 's face or plunge him head - first into buckets of icy water to shock the vagus nerve , which runs from the brain to the abdomen , into lowering his heart rate			1
' it was unbearable , ' says @entity9			0
' he 'd fight a bit , then stop thrashing			0
i thought they 'd drown him			0
' when he was almost three , @entity0 had surgery at the @entity173 , @entity174 , to fit the pulmonary band			1
he also had an external temporary pacemaker fitted to provide electrical stimulation to correct the disturbances in his heart rhythm			2
' he was a tiny little thing , with skin so thin you could see his veins , ' recalls @entity9			0
' everyone said he 'd thrive after surgery			0
but he was in intensive care for four weeks and we thought he 'd never come off the ventilator			0
' three children died on @entity0 's ward while he was there			1
' the noise parents make when their child dies is a sound i never want to hear again , ' she says			0
' then their precious child is taken away on a metal gurney , under a white sheet , and the parents go with them			0
how the mums manage to walk , i do n't know			0
the cardiac ward is like a war zone			0
you focus on your own child and will him to breathe			0
' when @entity0 was five he went to school for a couple of mornings a week in a wheelchair			1
then , when he was six , he had a 17 - hour operation called a ' double switch ' to change the arteries round			2
throughout the surgery , @entity9 paced , and shopped for clothes and toys for her son			0
' i thought if i bought him enough stuff , he 'd be all right , ' she says			0
afterwards , @entity0 briefly looked amazingly healthy			1
but three weeks later he was worse than before			0
' the doctors said there was nothing else they could do , and we were offered palliative care ; i had to draw up a plan for how i wanted him to die , and it felt as if i was signing his death certificate			0
it was like giving up - and i was n't ready to do that			2
' @entity0 and his mother @entity9			1
they are now waiting for a new heart @entity0 's team at the @entity173 , desperately trying to buy him more time , asked @entity24 , which specialises in children 's heart transplants , to assess his suitability			1
by then , @entity0 had end - stage heart failure , his heart only just keeping him alive			1
three months later , on november 11 , @entity241 , he had his transplant			2
' we are forever grateful that someone who lost a loved one had the selflessness that gave @entity0 a new life , ' says @entity9			1
when @entity0 came back from surgery she did n't recognise him because he was pink , not grey			1
@entity0 , always tiny , began to crave big meals such as roast dinners , and grew in front of her eyes			1
after @entity253 he was able to go to school full - time , and he never looked back			2
his life since has been full of fun			2
but although he loves sport and the house is full of medals and cups he has won in the @entity261 , @entity9 has never completely relaxed			0
' a transplant will only last 15 to 20 years , ' she says			2
' you know it 's not for ever			0
' at a routine check - up last october , there was devastating news			0
@entity0 has developed a form of rejection of his new heart , which causes his arteries to narrow			1
his heart ca n't pump blood around his body fast enough , so he is at constant risk of cardiac arrest			0
' i was absolutely hysterical and , at the same time , trying to be strong for @entity0 , ' says @entity9			2
' the shortage of organs is such that they would n't put @entity0 on the list until he 's dying			2
we have now reached that point			0
' his consultant said : " @entity0 , if you do @entity286 , you will drop down dead "			2
' he is n't allowed to do any activity that would cause his heart to pump faster , and spends most of his time on his playstation			0
' at parents ' evening recently , @entity0 's teachers said he has so much potential but , since he had this devastating news , he has been difficult and destructive			2
he dreams of being a pe teacher , but does n't know if he 'll be alive long enough to take his gcses			0
' @entity0 talks about another teenage boy he met at @entity24			2
i told him : " do n't worry , the surgery will be fine			0
" but , in the end , he did n't get his heart in time and he died			0
' how does @entity0 cope ? ' honestly , i do n't think about it , ' he says			2
' there 's no point			0
i 'm really hoping for a new heart , but in the meantime i just get on with my life			2
what else can i do ? '			0
