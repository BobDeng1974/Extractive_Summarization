a 15 - year - old says she was humiliated by a teacher who showed an enlarged picture of her in a bikini to more than 100 other students during a school assembly			1
children at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , were shown the photograph taken from her @entity12 profile to illustrate the pitfalls of posting private images online			1
unknown to the schoolgirl , who has not been named , staff had taken her swimwear photo off the internet			1
it was blown up and added to a portfolio of other pictures then shown during a packed school assembly			1
the shock tactic at the 1327 - pupil specialist arts school left the girl distraught			1
' they used other photos of kids from the neck up but for some reason they thought it was ok to use a picture of my daughter in her bikini			0
' why did they have to use an image like that to make their point			0
then they pointed her out in the assembly			2
' i got a phone call from my daughter in the afternoon			0
when she told me about it i went from nought to sixty			0
i was so upset at work i was sent home			0
' she 's really upset and hurt and this has knocked her confidence			1
she 's not the type of girl who likes attention like this			1
' she 's a tom - boy , she does n't wear make - up and she does n't even have her ears pierced			1
it 's not often you even get her in a bikini			0
' complaint : the girl 's mother , says she has had an apology from the headteacher , but has complained to @entity36 about the incident the woman , who does not want her daughter to be identified , has now written to education watchdogs @entity36 , the board of governors and the head teacher to demand answers about the incident			1
she says if the school were concerned about the image , they should have pulled her daughter aside or contacted her to voice concerns - rather than using it to embarrass her			1
she added : ' the headteacher has since phoned me and could n't me more apologetic			0
i do n't think she was aware it was going to happen			0
' the school today said today it had stated a ' formal investigation ' into the incident , which will consider the teacher 's conduct			2
a spokesman added : ' in a @entity108 assembly last week on the topic of " online safety " , students were shown a @entity111 including a short video about the potential dangers of which they need to be aware			1
' one of the images in the presentation was of an @entity119 student wearing shorts and a bikini top			0
the member of staff leading the assembly had accessed the picture simply by googling the names of some of our students			2
' she wanted to illustrate how freely available such images are , through the internet			2
we are really sorry for the way in which this important message was delivered			0
this was an error of judgement : the member of staff had not intended to cause any embarrassment '			0
a @entity141 spokesperson said on behalf of the school , whose motto is ' learning , caring , achieving ' : ' we can not comment on the incident itself			0
' it is very important that young people understand the risks of posting images and messages about themselves online			1
' all our partner agencies , including all schools , have a duty to promote on - line safety and equip all pupils and students with the ability to stay safe online			2
' most images placed online on social networking sites or through the use of smartphones can be found and copied , and then shared			2
' sadly , there are people of all ages who know that they can use photographic images to bully , exploit or coerce others , and do so			0
' the advice given to children and parents is that it is very difficult to ensure any picture is completely private and it is important to positively manage their online identity and profile and think carefully before sharing personal content			2
