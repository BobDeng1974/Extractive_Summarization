by @entity1 reporter published : 10:07 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 10:49 est , 24 october 2013 a drone operator has revealed the emotional toll years of remotely aiming missiles at people on the other side of the world has had on him			1
for more than five years @entity8 worked as a @entity11 @entity10 drone operator , firing missiles remotely from a @entity14 base			1
but the 27 - year - old said watching the grisly consequences of his actions unfold on a computer screen led to drinking , depression and finally a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder			1
haunted : @entity8 is suffering from ptsd after years of working as a drone operator ' i can see every little pixel if i just close my eyes , ' mr @entity8 , who believes he is responsible for more than 1,600 fatal hits , said			1
his experiences have been shared as two human rights groups raised serious concerns about the consequences of drone strikes in @entity34 and @entity35 , @entity28 reported			1
while the @entity11 argues that the strikes are vital in the fight against terror , @entity36 and @entity37 have said some attacks , which have killed scores of civilians , could amount to war crimes			1
for mr @entity8 , who described being in ' zombie mode ' as he monitored drone cameras , the effect of the strikes caused personal problems because he could never escape the deadly impact of his work			1
the @entity53 native , who signed up to the @entity10 when he was 19 , made his first kill in 2007 , an event he remembers in vivid detail			2
after aiming a hellfire missile at three men on a dirt road in @entity60 , mr @entity8 watched the aftermath unfold on a monitor			2
control room : drone operators are surrounded by screens showing targets and confirmed hits destructive : residents look at a burned car hit by a drone in @entity34			2
the @entity11 says the strikes are vital but human rights groups disagree @entity74 : a graph shows the rise in drone attacks in @entity60 ( blue ) and @entity34 ( yellow ) under presidents @entity80 and @entity82 ' the smoke clears , and there 's pieces of the two guys around the crater			1
and there 's this guy over here , and he 's missing his right leg above his knee , ' he said in a november article for @entity95			0
' he 's rolling around , and the blood is squirting out of his leg , and it 's hitting the ground , and it 's hot			0
his blood is hot , ' mr @entity8 said			2
' it took him a long time to die			0
i watched him become the same color as the ground he was lying on			0
' while the @entity11 continues to back its drone program , even under international criticism , mr @entity8 said remotely operating the devices led to his decision to quit the air force and turn down a $ 109,000 bonus			1
horror : @entity8 says he finds it hard to relate to others after years of watching grisly drone strkes ' people say that drone strikes are like mortar attacks , ' he told @entity117			1
' well , artillery does n't see this ... it 's really more intimate for us , because we see everything			0
' as mr @entity8 came near to the end of his drone service he was presented with what amounted to a score card showing the number of fatal hits he had made			1
' i would ’ve been happy if they never even showed me the piece of paper			0
i 've seen @entity11 soldiers die , innocent people die , and insurgents die			0
and it 's not pretty			0
it 's not something that i want to have - this diploma , ' he said			0
among the many upsetting scenes mr @entity8 witnessed was an incident when his drone recorded insurgents burying a roadside bomb in the path of @entity11 soldiers			1
' we had no way to warn the troops , ' he said , adding that three servicemen were killed after driving over the device			0
detached : drones may be operated remotely but the servicemen controlling them see the results of strikes firsthand he also remains haunted by the image of a small figure running towards a building he had just aimed at in @entity60			2
mr @entity8 was convinced the figure was a child , but his superiors told him it was a dog			2
he claims that in the final report of the strike , neither a child or dog was mentioned			0
his experiences left mr @entity8 ' feeling like a sociopath ' , he said			1
' i do n’t feel like i can really interact with that average , everyday person			0
i get too frustrated , because a ) they do n't realize what 's going on over there			0
and b ) they do n't care			0

@entity8 left with post traumatic stress disorder after six years of watching horrific injuries and deaths caused by strikes
