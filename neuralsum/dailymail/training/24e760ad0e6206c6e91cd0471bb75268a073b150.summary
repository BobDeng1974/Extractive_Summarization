@entity0 has overcome his first hurdle toward becoming a successful @entity3 manager ; he has @entity5 ’ blessing			1
‘ i spoke with @entity5 after i signed , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ and i met with @entity6 at the last game i played at @entity8 with @entity9			2
@entity5 told me it was a good decision joining @entity3			1
he said : “ well done ”			2
‘ @entity5 is in love with @entity3 and he ’s an idol here			1
all he told me about @entity3 was great , unbelievable			1
and now i can invite him to a barbecue at my house to spend time with him			2
’ boost : @entity0 ( above ) claims he has the blessing of @entity17 legend @entity5 @entity0 and @entity18 certainly would not be short of conversation			1
both @entity17 , both have played for the national team and , now , both have managed @entity3			1
of course , their international playing careers took somewhat different paths			2
@entity0 was just six when @entity5 helped @entity25 to @entity27 glory in 1978 in @entity28			1
‘ i watched the game on a black and white tv			2
it was unbelievable , ’ said @entity0 , whose @entity25 career was not quite so illustrious			1
his 20 caps are best remembered on these shores for his clumsy challenge on @entity36 during the @entity27 2002 group stages that led to @entity39 ’s penalty in @entity41 ’s 1 - 0 win			1
however , @entity0 hopes he can go on to emulate and even surpass @entity18 ’ legendary status at @entity3			1
helping @entity3 break back into the top four would be the best start to his @entity3 career and a 2 - 1 win over @entity47 in their final pre-season game will give them confidence			1
but the 42 - year - old insists his job security does not hinge on qualification for the @entity53			2
good decision : former @entity3 star @entity5 has told @entity0 that he made the right choice ‘ i do n’t have any specific targets , , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ yes , i ’m confident i will be given time by the chairman			2
we need time to decide and make the right decisions			0
‘ @entity3 is a big club , you always need to win every game			1
but at the moment we need to develop our philosophy , our style			0
and at the same moment , you need to provide the club and the players with a new philosophy or new style			0
‘ it ’s true our style is playing attacking football , pressing high and giving our fans enjoyment of the game			0
but then you need to get results			0
we need to play to win and , in our style and our philosophy , to keep the ball and play forward and not to change anything whether you play @entity79 [ or not ]			2
’ winners : @entity3 defeated @entity47 2 - 1 in a pre-season friendly at @entity8 on saturday @entity0 is confident that his excellent spell at @entity9 will leave him in a better position to make a success of his latest role , starting at @entity86 on saturday			1
he said : ‘ adapting is always difficult			0
and when you take a job in the @entity91 , all clubs have a difficult situation			0
all players who arrived from a different league — when they do n’t speak the same language , it ’s difficult to adapt			0
when i stayed in @entity97 , i said , “ the @entity99 league , it ’s ok			0
learning : the new @entity3 boss is confident his spell at @entity9 will has left him in a good position ' it ’s competitive ”			1
but , when you arrive , you say , “ ooh , it ’s hard — it ’s very hard ”			0
and , after , you realise that it ’s the most competitive league			0
i stayed in @entity109 and in @entity97			0
it ’s not the same			0
here , it ’s hard			0
‘ i had an unbelievable year and a half at @entity9			0
i enjoyed it a lot			0
i hope i enjoy it here too			0
