by @entity1 reporter published : 06:50 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 29 july 2013 a flamingo has baffled experts after it started acting like a swan to keep cool during @entity6 's roasting hot summer			1
the birds normally deal with heat by standing on one leg while briefly dousing themselves in water			1
but this 52 - year - old flamingo has broken the habit of a lifetime and taken to swimming on the lakes at @entity16 in @entity17 , and looks just like a floating pink swan			1
keepers at the centre say they have never witnessed the ' unusual ' behaviour before			2
' i first noticed the unusual behaviour as the weather warmed up a few weeks ago so i think it is his way of keeping cool in the heat of the day			2
' he floats with his legs outstretched behind him for long periods of time			0
' i think it is his way of relaxing , as he seems very content			0
it is presumably the equivalent to a human floating in a swimming pool on a lilo			0
' spot the difference : this @entity63 flamingo at the @entity64 shows how they normally stand in a shallow pond in hot weather a group of flamingos are known as a flamboyance and are found across the world			1
there are six difference species of the bird and they get their pink or red colour thanks to the small bacteria they eat which live in water .			0

flamingos usually stand on one leg and *splash* in shallow water to keep cool
but one living in a @entity35 *wetland* centre swims like a swan instead
