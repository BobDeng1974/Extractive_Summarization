by @entity1 reporter published : 08:32 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 10:12 est , 24 january 2014 nutrition labels on the back of food packages may soon become easier to read			1
the @entity6 says knowledge about nutrition has evolved over the last 20 years , and the labels need to reflect that			1
as the agency considers revisions , nutritionists and other health experts have their own wish list of desired changes			1
calories to the front of the line : new labels will likely focus on calories , but remove calories from fat the number of calories should be more prominent , they say , and the amount of added sugar and percentage of whole wheat in the food should be included			1
they also want more clarity on how serving sizes are defined			2
' there 's a feeling that nutrition labels have n't been as effective as they should be			0
' says @entity37 of the @entity38			2
' when you look at the label , there are roughly two dozen numbers of substances that people are n't intuitively familiar with			0
' for example , he says , most of the nutrients are listed in grams , the metric system 's basic unit of mass. @entity37 says people do n't really understand what a gram is			2
@entity55 , the @entity6 's deputy commissioner for foods , says 20 years ago ' there was a big focus on fat , and fat undifferentiated			1
' since then , health providers have focused more on calories and warned people away from saturated and trans fats more than all fats			0
trans fats were separated out on the label in 2006			0
the nutrition facts label ' is now 20 years old , the food environment has changed and our dietary guidance has changed , ' says @entity55 , who was at the agency in the early 1990s when the @entity6 first introduced the label at the behest of @entity73			1
' it 's important to keep this updated so what is iconic does n't become a relic			0
' the @entity6 has sent guidelines for the new labels to the @entity80 , but @entity55 would not estimate when they might be released			2
the @entity6 has been working on the issue for a decade , he said			0
due for a makeover : current food labels focus more on outdated portion sizes and fat content there 's evidence that more people are reading the labels in recent years			1
according to an @entity93 study released this month , a greater percentage of adults reported using the nutrition facts panel and other claims on food packages ' always or most of the time ' in 2009 and 2010 compared with two years earlier			1
the @entity93 study said 42 percent of working adults used the panel always or most of the time in 2009 and 2010 , up from 34 percent			0
older adults used it 57 percent of the time during that period , up from 51 percent			0
one expected change in the label is to make the calorie listing more prominent , and @entity108 of the @entity109 said that could be useful to consumers			2
her group represents the nation 's largest food companies			0
@entity108 said @entity6 also has suggested that it may be appropriate to remove the ' calories from fat ' declaration on the label			1
it 's not yet clear what other changes the @entity6 could decide on			0
nutrition advocates are hoping the agency adds a line for sugars and syrups that are not naturally occurring in foods and drinks and are added when they are processed or prepared			2
right now , some sugars are listed separately among the ingredients and some are not			0
it may be difficult for the @entity6 to figure out how to calculate added sugars , however			1
food manufacturers are adding naturally occurring sugars to their products so they can label them as natural â € ” but the nutrition content is no different			1
other suggestions from health advocates : @entity142 , a @entity143 - based nutrition consultant , says clearer information is needed to balance the billions of dollars a year that the food industry spends on food marketing			1
' there 's a lot of information there , it 's messy , ' she says			0
' there may be a way to call out certain things and put them in context			0

food labels are being *redesigned* for the first time in 20 years
' calories from fat ' may be removed
' per cent of whole wheat ' could be added
serving sizes are likely to be *tweaked* to reflect more realistic portions
add the percentage of whole wheat to the label . many manufacturers will label products ' whole wheat ' when there is really only a *small* percentage of it in the food .
clearer *measurements* . @entity37 of @entity38 and others have suggested that the @entity6 use **teaspoon*s* , as well as grams , for added sugars , since consumers can envision a *teaspoon* .
serving sizes that make sense . there 's no easy answer , but health experts say that single - size servings that are clearly meant to be eaten in one *sitting* will often list two or three servings on the label , making the calorie and other nutrient information *deceptive* . @entity6 said last year that it may add another *column* to the labels , listing nutrition information per serving and per *container* . the agency may also *adjust* recommended serving sizes for some foods .
package - front labeling . beyond the panel on the back , nutrition experts have *pushed* for labels on the package front for certain nutrients so consumers can see them more easily . the @entity6 said several years ago it would issue guidelines for front of pack labeling , but later said it would hold off to see whether the industry could create its own labels .
