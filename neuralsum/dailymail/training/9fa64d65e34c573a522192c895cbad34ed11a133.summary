it 's been a tough two weeks but i 'm so glad i 've done my time at @entity2			1
last week i checked in looking decidedly lumpy – but now i feel fitter , healthier and i 've got my six - pack back			1
i 'm also 8lb lighter in less than a week and now weigh in at 12 stone 6lb			1
last week i was too ashamed to show my ' before ' picture , i 'm only putting it out there now because it makes my ' after ' look even better			1
but that said i 'm happy with where i am			1
how i did it was not easy – but there is no easy way to lose weight and get in shape			1
no 1 @entity2 's resident trainer , former @entity23 @entity22 came up with the most fiendish physical torture i 've ever had to endure – the @entity26 - 181 steps of pain built into the side of a cliff and i had to run up and down them 10 times , with dumb bells and do exercises at the bottom with the weights			1
you can see how steep they are in the pictures – and they feel steeper with every journey			2
they are situated near the picturesque @entity42 beach but you do n't really feel much like taking in the view			2
this was agonising muscle pain and a nauseating test of stamina			2
toughen up : @entity9 took part in a considerable amount of high intensity interval training stairway to success : @entity9 ran up and down 181 steps 10 times time out : @entity9 takes a much needed breather from his high intensity workout back at the villa there were other special ' games ' that @entity22 had devised			1
there were boxing work outs in a @entity64 style - @entity64 ( @entity64 ) where i had to hit the pads he was holding for 20 seconds with maximum effort , then 10 seconds rest , then repeat eight times			2
we repeated this six times in a row totaling around 30 mins			2
i felt sick with fatigue , was seeing stars and was sucking wind			0
apparently this means you are doing it properly			0
i 've got to say i found it easier in the mornings to get motivated and to get some energy by taking a couple of @entity86 super strength , they also helped me combat hunger pangs in the afternoons			0
then there was the burpees challenge			0
just for anyone that is n't familiar with a burpee – it is not some unfortunate bit of trapped wind due to indigestion , it is an exercise that has you drop from a standing position to a squat , then push out your legs , bring them back to the squat and then jump back to a standing position			0
mind , body , soul : @entity9 practices a spot of yoga during the retreat getting into the spirit : @entity9 attempts some more adventurous moves during yoga no. 1 : @entity9 feels far more confident since shaping up health hero : @entity9 enjoys some quinoa on the beach in @entity117 the burpee challenge starts off easy and then gets insanely hard			1
1st minute – one burpee , 2nd minute – two burpees , and so on until 15th minutes – 15 burpees			0
by the end you have done 120 burpees			0
i do n't think i would have coped in the mornings to get motivated without taking a couple of @entity86 super strength , they also helped me combat hunger pangs in the afternoons			0
thankfully there were also some gentler pursuits and the @entity135 yoga around the pool i found particularly relaxing – i attempted the @entity137 , the @entity139 salutation , the high plank and the @entity141 pose			1
there was also time for a bit of sun - bathing on the beach			0
despite the daily torture at the hands of @entity148 , i 've got to say i feel so much better about myself , not just that i look physically better either			0
there 's something really empowering about coming to no 1 @entity2 and i 'll definitely go again			0
maybe not for another six months though			0
all the best , @entity151 getting tyred ? @entity9 builds up his upper body strength lifting heavy objects while running inner strength : @entity9 feels the strain as he lifts a set of weights			1

@entity9 has spent the past two weeks in a boot camp in @entity117
he has been practicing high intensity workouts and stuck to a strict diet
@entity9 has lost 8lb over his stay and his *regained* his six pack
