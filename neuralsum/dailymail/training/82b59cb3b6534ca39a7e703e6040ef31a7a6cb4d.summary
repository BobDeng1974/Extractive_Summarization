by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 15:10 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 21:19 est , 21 may 2013 the elementary school in which seven children drowned after a monster tornado barreled through an @entity8 suburb on monday had not built a tornado shelter as they could not afford it , officials have admitted			1
there was growing disbelief as cost - cutting state leaders revealed that even after a devastating tornado struck the area 14 years ago , most schools in @entity1 still had no purpose - built shelters			1
and as @entity0 's mayor claimed that the death toll could have been over a thousand if so many residents had n't been able to hide in underground shelters , it became clear why such a large proportion of the casualties were school children			1
in may 1999 , the area was ravaged by a fierce tornado that killed 44			1
many residents responded by building their own underground tornado shelters at their own expense			1
but , incredibly , school children were not afforded the same protection			2
around half the children stayed inside , finding shelter where they could in bathrooms			1
seven are believed to have drowned			2
an online petition was set up by a member of the public within hours of the tragedy demanding that shelters be put in every school , apartment building and mobile home park in @entity1			1
@entity53 , the mayor of the @entity8 suburb of @entity0 , claimed most schools in the state did not have special shelters except those rebuilt after being destroyed in the 1999 tornado			1
' most of the schools in @entity1 do not have shelters			2
it 's because of the cost , ' he told @entity64			2
' the new ones that were hit in the 1999 tornado , they do have built - in shelters			1
' before the storm : an aerial photograph shows @entity35 before it was hit by the monster tornado on monday destruction : an aerial view shows the school after the two mile - wide tornado touched down on monday he insisted that this gaping hole in the city 's safety precautions would now belatedly be rectified			1
' it 's something that we ’re definitely going to look at , ' he said			0
' the school system and the city are two separate entities but i 'm sure we ’ll be talking to them to try and get them federal emergency money to help rebuild these schools			0
' @entity88 , a state congressman who represents @entity0 , said he was ' just choking back tears , trying to be strong ' as he helped rescuers search through the rubble			0
defending the lack of school tornado shelters , he said education already accounted for a large proportion of local government spending			2
' our budgets are stretched and education takes a lot of the money - 50 plus per cent , ' he said			0
he admitted school shelters ' had not been a priority ' but predicted that would now change			0
missing : family members have said that @entity106 , left , and @entity107 , right , are missing tragedy : eight - year - old @entity109 died instantly after the tornado struck his school monday afternoon in an emotional speech during a press conference on tuesday , @entity114 , from @entity115 , said that safety was their priority			2
' i would like to extend my sincere sympathies to all those who have suffered losses , ' she said			0
' our hearts go out to each of you and please know we are all here with you			0
' she added that while the path of the tornado was unpredictable , all storm procedures were implemented at every school site			1
it comes as it also emerged that a storm shelter program that officials had devised for @entity0 was put on hold just months before the town was flattened by the deadly two mile - wide tornado			1
officials had devised a plan to help residents build storm shelters and applied for $ 2 million from the @entity145 ( @entity145 ) to build safe rooms in 800 homes in @entity0			1
' it is the desire of the @entity151 to assist persons who are in @entity0 to have a place to seek refuge from severe weather , ' the letter read			0
but a letter which was released by the city in february and first seen by the @entity158 shows that the program was put on hold as authorities tried to navigate federal regulations			1
hide out : a man looks down what appears to be a storm shelter in the aftermath of the tornado the officials predicted in the storm shelters should receive their final approval date of november 1 , 2012			1
in the letter , the city said regulations put in place by @entity145 for the money were a ' constantly moving target ' , which had slowed down progress at getting federal funds			2
in another complication , the federal grant program that was giving out the money they desired allocates its funds during presidential major disaster declarations , the letter said			0
' @entity1 has had few of these declarations in the past couple of years , so there is not a lot of grant money available , ' it explained			0
the statement , which was released in february on the city 's website , revealed the city 's frustrations			0
' @entity151 's safe room rebate program is still " on hold " , with not a lot changed from our update of last may , ' it read			2
' we 've found that the @entity145 requirements and their interpretations seem to be a constantly moving target , more so with the new wrinkles			0
' officials said they hoped to have another plan submitted by march , yet it is unknown if this went through			1
search : two firefighters break through concrete during the search for survivors at @entity35 shelters are not compulsory in the state despite its location in so - called @entity220			1
basements are rare in the state because of the damp soil , meaning water seeps into storm cellars and basements , which leads to mold and fungus			2
water pressure can also build up due to the soaked soil , which puts pressure on basement walls and the concrete can eventually give way			0
' people think they can dodge the bullet , ' said mr @entity88 when asked why schools had no shelters			0
' we have n't had a major one [ tornado ] since 1999			2
we 're brave and stand in our driveways watching the storms go by			0
' @entity1 's lieutenant governor , @entity243 , dismissed reports that the ground was so hard in the state that it was impossible to dig out a basement without using dynamite			0
nothing left : @entity251 flags wave over the remains of @entity35 on tuesday he claimed some schools used basements instead of purpose built underground shelters			1
but he had to admit that the basement under @entity259 proved to be a death trap			0
' there are basements , there are shelters			0
but of course not everybody has one , ' he said			0
neither @entity0 nor @entity8 have designated public storm shelters , and residents are told to go to their basements or storm cellars if they have them			1
if they do not , they are advised to go to interior hallways and to stay away from windows .			0

@entity35 was a direct hit during the tornado
it also emerged that a storm shelter plan for residents was put on hold just months ago because officials *jumped* through *bureaucratic* hoops
