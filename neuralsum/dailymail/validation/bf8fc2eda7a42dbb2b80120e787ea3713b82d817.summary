when @entity1 slumped to a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity3 in november , the obituaries were penned mourning the loss of the team who had thrilled so much in their pursuit of last season ’s title			1
here they were ; losers in their last four matches , sandwiched between @entity12 and @entity13 in the bottom half of the table and just four points from the drop zone			0
indeed , @entity18 noted : ‘ as a gauge for @entity21 to measure @entity1 's regression it might be quite accurate			1
no better at the back than they were six months ago , much worse up front and utterly devoid of belief ’			0
@entity21 ( right , jokes with @entity27 ) at @entity1 training at @entity29 last week @entity21 was in good spirits as he also shared a joke with defender @entity32 @entity33 trains with team - mates @entity35 ( left ) and @entity36 ( centre ) @entity1 have not lost in their last 12 games - a run that has seen them rise from 10th in the table to fifth			1
should they beat @entity41 on monday then they will be just two points off fourth place			1
@entity44 ( @entity45 ) @entity47 - 1 - 0 @entity46 ( a ) @entity41 ( @entity45 ) @entity48 ( @entity45 ) @entity47 - 1 - 0 @entity49 ( a ) @entity47 - 2 - 0 @entity50 ( a ) @entity52 - 0 @entity51 ( @entity45 ) @entity54 - 0 - 0 @entity53 ( a ) @entity55 ( @entity45 ) @entity56 ( a ) @entity57 ( @entity45 ) @entity47 - 2 - 0 @entity46 ( @entity45 ) it was , of course , a reference to @entity1 ’s surrender of a three - goal lead at @entity61 during the final weeks of the previous campaign			1
six months on and , minus @entity64 , the assumption was that @entity21 and his team had been found out			1
then came a 1 - 0 win at home to @entity13 – achieved thanks to a @entity36 strike five minutes from time – and so started a run of 11 victories in 16 games			1
another at @entity41 on monday evening would see them move back to within two points of @entity76 in fourth			1
given their lowly residence in november , @entity21 arguably deserves more credit this time around than he did for last season ’s unlikely title tilt			1
the return to fitness of @entity84 was always going to aid his cause and that has been evidenced by three goals and six league games without defeat with the striker back on the pitch			2
the unbeaten run , in fact , extends to 12 matches and is just two shy of last season ’s best sequence set by @entity97			1
@entity84 and @entity98 ( right ) celebrate after scoring against @entity3 in february @entity84 , injured on @entity100 duty before the start of season , has had a stop - start season in 2014 but the revival was in place before @entity84 vacated the treatment room			0
a change of formation in december , 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 put in place , has , almost to a man , brought about an impressive improvement			2
there is no finer example than @entity113			0
the midfielder was never struggling but , since @entity115 , he has matured into the leader everyone at @entity118 was hoping he would become			0
there was one game at former club @entity49 which marked his emergence as successor to @entity33			0
when the skipper made way at half - time , @entity113 took the armband and proceeded to boss the contest from the centre of the park – it was an awesome display and one which won warm praise from @entity21 afterwards			2
@entity113 has thrived for @entity1 this season and stepped up in @entity33 's absence @entity64 ( left ) departed @entity1 for @entity135 during the summer in a £ 75million deal the boss , though , should be applauded for the manner in which he is aiding the development of a player who is still just 24			2
the future captaincy is an incentive smartly employed to take @entity113 ’s game to another level – and it has worked			0
but there are others , too			0
@entity147 is unrecognisable from the troubled teen as which he has previously been cast			0
@entity21 has found a way to extract craft and graft from @entity147 and playmaker @entity153 , a pair who are certain to feature on the shortlist for @entity155			2
he has also kept faith with goalkeeper @entity157 – derided earlier in the season – while @entity160 – another mocked following his £ 20m arrival from @entity56 – has returned to a three - man backline which has kept four clean sheets in six			0
@entity33 's slip at @entity118 against @entity97 last year proved costly and allowed @entity165 to score @entity165 slots the ball past @entity167 as @entity97 win 2 - 0 and end @entity1 's title hopes video every game counts for @entity21 in short , @entity21 is getting the best out of each of his number – unmanageable @entity174 apart , that is			1
but sideshows such as @entity176 and @entity33 ’s impending departure have not been allowed to derail their recovery			0
a penalty - shootout exit from the @entity180 could prove a blessing as @entity1 chase a @entity183 finish			2
they have 10 games to achieve as much and @entity21 has factored a return of 23 points as being enough			1
were they to achieve that , @entity21 would certainly have proved a point of his own			0
