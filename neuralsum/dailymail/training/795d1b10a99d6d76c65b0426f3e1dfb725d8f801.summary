by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 08:57 est , 19 september 2013 a mother has spoken of her shock after she gave birth to a baby with two fully formed front teeth			1
@entity6 had planned to breastfeed little @entity7 but changed her mind after seeing the newborn ’s teeth			1
@entity7 astounded nurses and midwives as well as her family when she was born weighing 7lbs 4oz at the @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity7 was born on september 8 with two front teeth in her lower gum			1
her mother , @entity6 , 26 , said she had been planning to breastfeed but that she changed her mind when she saw the teeth initially , nobody realised and it was only when mrs @entity6 went to have a bath after giving birth that her husband @entity24 spotted the teeth in his daughter ’s lower jaw			1
mrs @entity6 , a 26 - year - old child minder , said : ‘ when i came back into the room @entity24 said , “ she ’s got teeth , you know ! ” and then we both burst out laughing			1
‘ we were in shock , and so were the midwives			0
‘ she had her mouth closed to begin with , so we did n’t notice			0
it was quite bizarre to see them			0
’ she added : ‘ i had been planning to breastfeed , but when i saw @entity7 ’s teeth i was put off			1
i do n’t think anybody could blame me ! ’ mr and mrs @entity6 now worry that @entity7 will soon start sprouting more teeth before she is old enough to have calpol or other children ’s medicine			1
@entity44 , consultant neonatologist at @entity45 , said : ' it probably happens about three times every two years here and we deliver 4,000 babies a year			0
it 's every 2,000 to 3,000 births ' mr and mrs @entity6 ( pictured ) are worried that @entity7 will grow more teeth before she is old enough to be given any pain relief the mother - of - three said : ‘ i kept asking the midwives and nurses what i could give @entity7 if she was in pain , but nobody was able to answer me			1
‘ they just kept going away and then coming back with more people to look at @entity7 ’s teeth			2
‘ when we came out of hospital i went to see my gp and he said that he had never heard of this happening before			0
‘ midwives with 25 - years ’ experience were also saying they ’d never seen it			0
’ @entity74 was born on september 8 and is now at home with her parents and older sisters @entity79 , seven , and @entity80 , five , in @entity81 , @entity82			1
at first mrs @entity6 thought the teeth would have to be removed in case @entity84 were to choke on them , but she was checked over by a paediatrician who said they were stable enough not to present a problem			1
mrs @entity6 said : ' i had been planning to breastfeed , but when i saw @entity7 's teeth i was put off			1
i do n't think anybody could blame me ! ' @entity7 is now thriving on bottled milk and delighting all that meet her with her unusual feature			2
mrs @entity6 added : ‘ @entity7 often has her mouth open , especially after she has woken up			1
‘ a professional baby photographer came round to take some pictures , and she simply could not believe it			0
everyone thinks @entity7 is lovely , but ca n’t get over her teeth			2
’ @entity44 , consultant neonatologist at @entity45 , said : ‘ it probably happens about three times every two years here and we deliver 4,000 babies a year			0
it ’s every 2,000 to 3,000 births			0
‘ babies are born with one or two teeth and it ’s usually in the lower gum			2
’ teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth			2
they occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies			0
they usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure meaning they are often wobbly			0
they are not usually well formed but can injure the baby 's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain			0
@entity126 teeth are often removed shortly after a baby is born because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them			2
these teeth are not usually associated with any other medical problems			0
there is no known explanation for them other than that a child is more dentally developed .			0

@entity6 , 26 , gave birth to 7lbs 4oz @entity74 on september 8
@entity7 was going to be breastfed but her mother has since changed her mind
around one in 2 - 3,000 children are born with teeth , say *doctors*
@entity7 has been checked by a paediatrician and he is *confident* the teeth will not cause her a problem
