by @entity0 at 9:56pm @entity2 @entity1 on 20 july 1969 , 94 per cent of @entity2 tvs were tuned to one thing : live coverage of @entity7 landing on the moon			1
but how did the general public get to be so enamoured by space exploration ? the authors of a new book say it was n’t by accident – @entity15 ran a broad and extensive advertising campaign that ensured the public would be sold on the idea of going to the moon			1
in @entity24 the @entity22 authors @entity20 and @entity23 highlight some of the advertising campaigns @entity15 ran in the days of the @entity28 programme in order to sell the public on missions to the moon , such as @entity33 's @entity32 ( pictured ) which imagined the possibilities of spaceflight the remarkable images in the book reveal some of the advertising campaigns @entity15 ran			1
in hindsight , some of their tricks and methods seem blindingly obvious now			0
but back in the day , they served to increase the profile of space exploration			0
in ' @entity24 : the @entity47 ' , which is on sale tomorrow in the @entity49 and already on sale in the @entity2 , authors @entity20 and @entity23 tell the story of how @entity15 sold the @entity28 programme to the public			1
it is , they say , one of the most successful marketing and public relations campaigns in history			2
the two of them are avid collectors of space memorabilia and in their book they have compiled over 200 adverts , tv stills and photographs from their private collections they have accumulated for two decades			1
they reveal how massive campaigns were launched by @entity15 in one of the first instances of ‘ brand journalism ’			2
they do n’t , however , say it was a bad thing – rather , it was deemed necessary at the time in order to drum up public support			2
@entity15 was keen to flaunt its astronauts at every opportunity , leading to them often having many appearances on tv			2
here astronauts from the @entity81 mission appear on the @entity83 show in 1971 on the left , @entity28 12 commander @entity84 advertises a pair of @entity88 sunglasses , while on the right @entity89 advertises their ' space - themed ' watch some companies were so proud of their involvement in the space programme that they would send reporters detailed schematics and diagrams of the components they had built to garner more press coverage ‘ imagine convincing the @entity2 public to spend as much as four percent of the national budget in some years , to send 12 people to the surface of the moon , ’ @entity20 tells @entity100			1
‘ it was a crazy thing to do and marketing got us there			0
’ co-author @entity23 adds that ‘ @entity28 was @entity15 ’s @entity111 event – targeted , scheduled , and sustained , with enough global interest to draw a big audience - share in a world with less media and communication choice			1
’ but today , the authors say , @entity15 is challenged by trying to engage a fractured , global audience in their endeavours			2
‘ from a marketing perspective , @entity15 is involved in so many areas , that there is no unified theme that pulls a large enough focused audience			2
it is a challenge many marketers face in many industries , ' says @entity23			0
‘ one needs to think of @entity15 like @entity129			0
if you just defined @entity129 by @entity131 , then you would miss its many other brands and message channels like @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , etc. ‘ we went to space to explore the moon , but in the end we discovered the @entity142			0
‘ things might have been completely different if we had found signs of life or precious metals and raw resources on the moon			0
instead , we saw @entity142 as a fragile blue marble — and started to look inward			0
’ @entity15 's unprecedented marketing campaign across all forms of media had the goal of getting the public excited about the prospect of a manned space programme and ensuring support for the agency continued to flow @entity15 signed an agreement with @entity159 ( left ) until 1962 that gave them exclusive astronauts to the astronauts			1
on the right is a memo sent from ex-journalist @entity165 to @entity166 , commander of @entity168 and later director of public affairs at @entity15 , pleading him to keep the actions of the astronauts unedited and unscripted a host of items including drinks ( pictured ) were given a ' space - theme ' to drum up support for the @entity28 programme @entity15 began in rather contentious circumstances – at the outset of the @entity2 space programme , the government was unsure whether to leave space exploration to the military or make it a civilian programme			1
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) became operational on 1 october 1958			0
back then it was afforded as much as 4 % of the national budget ; now it is under 1 %			0
its annual budget for 2012 was $ 17.8 billion			0
it has conducted a host of mission across the solar system			0
these include the first manned missions to the moon , the first missions to the outer solar system and the first rovers on @entity197			0
thanks to the efforts of @entity200 , deputy administrator for @entity15 from 1958 to 1967 , it was the latter that became the case			2
@entity15 was formally signed into being on 29 july 1958 , and with that the cosmic expectations of the nation were placed on its shoulders			0
the administrators of @entity15 over the next decade , @entity207 and then @entity208 , were both all too aware of the support the agency would need to succeed in the goal , set by @entity212 in 1961 , of beating the @entity213 to the moon			1
thus , with @entity208 in particular , he built @entity15 not only into a well - rounded scientific agency but also one that had public relations high on the agenda			1
@entity15 hired a host of media veterans to head its pr team , supplying the press with all the material they needed to keep the public informed about the agency ’s space efforts			1
‘ by having journalists work as the conduits for @entity15 to the outside world , @entity15 was perfectly positioned to deliver news and information content that could be quickly assimilated into the news streams of the day , ’ says @entity23			1
up until 1962 , for example , they signed an exclusive agreement with @entity159 to grant them access to the astronauts and their wives			0
across other magazines and newspapers , @entity15 began to highlight how space exploration was not necessarily just something of science fiction			2
rather , it was creating technologies that would benefit the common person			0
and their astronauts were not backroom scientists – they were charismatic men , most of them pilots , and @entity15 made sure to flaunt them at every opportunity to the public			2
here a news channel reports live on @entity28 , which at the time in april 1970 was stranded in space after an explosion on the spacecraft some companies were so proud of their involvement in the space programme that they would send reporters detailed schematics and diagrams of the components they had built to garner more press coverage the end result of all this intense marketing and pr to boost the profile of space exploration was that on 20 july 1969 , 94 per cent of @entity2 tvs were tuned in to watch @entity270 take humanity 's first steps on the lunar surface product placement was also a big deal , with cameras , watches , drinks and more given space - themed reboots			1
@entity280 shows off some of these public relations attempts made by @entity15 in a series of vintage photographs , artwork and advertisements			1
and this rare collection , containing many unpublished pieces of memorabilia , helps to tell the story of how those 94 per cent of @entity2 tvs were all tuned to @entity270 's first steps on the moon			1
‘ given their pioneering brand journalism and real - time marketing efforts , @entity28 is the single most important case study for modern pr and marketing practitioners in the last 100 years , ’ says @entity23			1
‘ the space program became a victim of its own success , and rather than having its successes extended across all of the government enterprise , the @entity2 people missed out on an opportunity for further innovation and productivity			2
@entity20 adds : ‘ [ @entity28 ] accomplished the most audacious goal ever attempted by humans			1
i do n’t see anything remotely like that today			0
‘ the reason we have n’t landed humans on @entity197 is due to a lack of marketing and pr. by invoking a quest , @entity212 motivated us			0
‘ if we ’re ever going to conquer space again , we need a powerful story to get us there			0
