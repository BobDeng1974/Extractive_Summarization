by @entity1 reporter published : 00:10 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 02:26 est , 3 september 2013 the @entity3 adoptive parents of @entity4 , an orphan from @entity5 , spoke to the press for the first time since being cleared of any wrong - doing in his death			1
@entity4 died last january at his new home in @entity11 , @entity12 after being left alone to play outside			1
his death became fodder for @entity5 politicians who deemed him the twenty - first @entity5 - born child to die at the hands of adoptive @entity3 parents - thus cementing a recent ban on all @entity3 adoptions in the country			2
breaking their silence : the adoptive parents of @entity4 , an orphan from @entity5 , gave their first interview since being cleared of any wrong - doing in his january death eight months after @entity4 's death , @entity28 and mrs @entity29 gave their first interview with the @entity32			1
mrs @entity29 recalled the day she lost her newly - adopted son and the grief she 's experienced since his passing			1
@entity36 and @entity37 adopted two half - brothers , 3 - year - old @entity4 and 2 - year - old @entity39 , from @entity5 last november , after multiple failed fertility treatments and three miscarriages			2
the adoption process was n't much easier			0
it cost them $ 31,000 to adopt one child , and an addition $ 12,000 for a sibling - not counting the travel for three required trips to @entity5			0
but after meeting the two boys on their first trip , they knew it would all be worth it			0
parents : @entity36 and @entity37 adopted @entity4 and his younger half - brother @entity39 last november from an orphanage in @entity5 soon after they brought the two home , they started to notice that @entity4 was hurting himself : picking at his skin , banging his head into the walls and hurling his body on the floor			2
at first , mr @entity4 thought @entity4 's self - abuse might be an adjustment issue that would pass - but it only got worse			1
they pointed these problems out to @entity4 's pediatrician who prescribed a medication usually given to autistic children , but they soon took him off it when he started acting ' like a zombie '			0
when they brought up @entity4 's ' adjustment issues ' to the child 's adoption caseworkers , they told him he was too young for medication or therapy			0
' they told us we need to love him more , ' mrs @entity29 said			2
signs of abuse : when coroners conducted an autopsy of the toddler they found signs of abuse - but have since ruled those bruises as self - inflicted playground accident : coroners say @entity4 died from internal bleeding most likely incurred from falling off the swing set seventy - nine days after they brought the two boys home , mrs @entity29 was watching them play outside when she had to use the bathroom , she says she considered taking the boys inside , but figured that she would be quick and the area was fenced off anyway			1
when she went back outside she found @entity4 on the ground and unresponsive			0
blame : mrs @entity29 still wonders if she played a role in @entity4 's death through the @entity103 process she called 911 and they tried to walk her through the process of cpr			1
but once emergency responders arrived 22 minutes later , @entity4 was pronounced dead			0
mrs @entity29 continues to be haunted by that day , and even questions whether or not she played a role in her son 's death			1
' i kept wondering : ‘ did i hurt my baby ? did i hurt my baby ? ’ @entity4 's autopsy highlighted some signs of possible abuse - some 30 bruises and other marks on his body			1
and those signs of abuse led to outrage in @entity5 , which had just recently passed legislation outlawing @entity3 adoptions of @entity5 orphans citing cases of abuse and neglect			0
after @entity4 's death , protest broke out across the country condemning the @entity132 , and calling for the return of @entity39			1
but an investigation on the family in the @entity3 has since determined that the wounds found on @entity4 's body were self - inflicted and his death was caused by internal injuries most likely caused by a fall from the swing set			1
the couple were warned about the health issues adopted children in @entity5 often have , but they instantly well in love with the two kids			0
' i saw them , and i just started crying , ' ms. @entity29 said			0
' when you ’ve been waiting to be a mother for so long , well , they could have had horns and we were still going after them			0
' they were told that @entity4 and @entity39 ' shared mother , 24 - year - old @entity156 , may have been drinking during her pregnancies , but they did n't know the extent			2
ms @entity156 's father , a neighbor and local child welfare officials all attest that she was heavily drinking during her pregnancy with @entity163 after finding out that @entity4 had died , ms @entity156 said she wanted to kill the @entity164 and now she wants her surviving child back			1
' i think they would have been better off with me , ' she said			0
better off ? @entity4 and @entity39 ' biological mother @entity156 - a noted alcoholic - has said that the boys would have been better off with her politicized : in @entity5 , people took to the streets to protest against @entity3 adoptions of their orphans			2
@entity4 's death only helped bolster the politicians case against foreign adoptions @entity5 officials agree , and have been trying to cancel the @entity4 's adoption of @entity39			1
but the @entity179 has assured the couple that this would n't be possible			0
though the couple have been cleared of any suspicion in @entity4 's death , life has n't gotten any easier since he passed			1
mrs @entity29 said shoppers have called her a murderer at the supermarket and some friends no longer visit or return phone calls			2
she 's afraid to leave the house with @entity39 in case someone will call her a name in front of him or a @entity5 official will kidnap him			0
they still have n't explained @entity4 's death to him			1
@entity39 has n't asked about @entity4 most likely because he 's used to the other children coming and going in the orphanage			0
while mrs @entity29 will always be heartbroken at the loss of her child , she says she 'd adopt him again if given the chance			2
' he had issues but he had the sweetest personality			0
i mean , looking back , we would have still brought him home			0
' worth it : if given the chance , mrs @entity29 said she would adopt @entity4 again in a heartbeat			1

@entity4 died last january after his adoptive mother @entity29 left him outside to play alone while she went to the bathroom
mrs @entity29 was investigated at first for a possible role in her son 's death after an autopsy revealed signs of abuse
but the @entity164 were eventually cleared of all suspicion as *doctors* ruled the injuries were caused by self - abuse
