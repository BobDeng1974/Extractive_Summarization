by @entity1 reporter a company has launched a fitness band for children as young as four which measures how much exercise they do			1
its makers claim it is a useful tool to encourage youngsters to play and develop healthy habits as parents track their activity			1
but it has had a less than positive reception from parents , who said that children should get out in the real world and play rather than ‘ burying their heads in technology ’			1

the band , which goes on sale today costs £ 29.99 and is designed for children aged four to seven			1
its makers claim that the device , which offers 50 different activities and challenges , monitors a child ’s physical movements and awards them points for being active			0
these points can then be translated into games and rewards , including ‘ healthy snacks ’ , for a choice of eight virtual pets , which they can personalise			0
the pet idea is similar to the @entity55 , a digital pet which can be named , fed and watered by its owners , and became a hit in @entity59 after originating in @entity60			0
on the website , the band ’s makers , @entity61 , write : ‘ discover the only activity tracker just for kids that encourages active play and healthy habits with a customisable pet pal			2
’ parents can download games for the band , which is being promoted by athletes @entity72 and @entity74			2
but the idea was criticised by parents who argued that children should be outside playing rather than using technology to take exercise			1

‘ he ’s too old for this but it ’s given me the idea of getting him something like it to perhaps jog his interest in moving about more ! ’ child obesity campaigners added that children should never be rewarded with food for completing exercises			2
@entity141 , of the @entity142 , which campaigns on childhood obesity , although welcoming the idea , said food should never be a reward for exercise			0
