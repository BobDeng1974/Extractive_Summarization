by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 is to pay £ 1million in compensation after being caught exaggerating savings customers could make if they switched			1
energy watchdog @entity5 found that for two years staff mis - sold deals in @entity10 ’s stores and at @entity12 shopping centre , @entity6			1
in some cases customers were told that they would save money by switching , but ended up paying more than if they had stayed with their existing supplier			1
@entity2 insisted it had acted to tackle the problems as soon as they came to light @entity5 ’s @entity21 said : ‘ @entity5 expects all suppliers to put this poor behaviour behind them and really start acting in a way that will help consumers trust energy suppliers			1
where they do n’t , @entity5 will act			0
’ sales staff did not compare tariffs on a like - for - like basis ,			1
instead they compared monthly direct debit with quarterly payment methods to produce inaccurate savings estimates			2
and in some cases , customers were told that they would save money by switching , but they paid more with @entity10 ’s energy or @entity40 gas than they would have paid if they had remained with their current supplier			1
which ? executive director @entity42 said : ‘ one of the reasons consumer trust in the energy industry is so low has been because of the repeated mis - selling scandals			1
this kind of poor practice is completely unacceptable			0
‘ we want to see all energy companies raising their game now , rather than waiting for the outcome of the competition inquiry			2
at the very least that means big improvements to basic practices and customer service			0
’ the firm was also criticised for failing to make clear it was the supplier of @entity10 's energy @entity2 said it discovered the mistakes through its own internal checks and added that it informed @entity5 of what had happened before taking steps to compensate customers			1
@entity65 , managing director of @entity66 , said : “ we are very sorry and have ensured no customer will be out of pocket as a result			0
“ we pride ourselves on our high standards and it is extremely disappointing when even a relatively small number of customers do n’t receive the service they expect from us			2
” he said all customers due a compensation payment have already received it as a credit on their account			2
since 2010 , @entity5 has imposed £ 100 million in fines and redress on energy companies for various rule breaches , including around £ 40 million for misselling			2
in may , @entity86 said it would pay £ 12 million to vulnerable customers due to poor sales practices , which lasted between june 2010 and december 2013			0
energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			1
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			1
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0
