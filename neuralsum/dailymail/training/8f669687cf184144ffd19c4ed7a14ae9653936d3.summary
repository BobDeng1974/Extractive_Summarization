’ on the up : ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years the demand for ice cream is slowly melting away as consumers are put off by high prices and switching to the more healthy option of frozen yoghurt , which is enjoying soaring sales			0
analysts say @entity158 will eat 27million fewer litres of ice cream this year than in 2007 , down 7 per cent , and spiralling prices mean the slide will continue over the next five years by another 7 per cent			0

@entity267 also reported that ice cream prices have soared by more than 25 per cent over the past five years as the prices of sugar and other raw materials have risen			0

together with the pressure on consumer incomes , this has gone some way to dampening demand			0

but temperatures will fall back to normal september levels by monday
