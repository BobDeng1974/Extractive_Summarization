having regular tv - free days can prevent you becoming overweight , the health watchdog is advising			1
on other days , avoid eating meals in front of the television and limit yourself to just two hours ’ viewing , it says			1
the advice , in guidelines issued by @entity10 – the @entity10 – is similar to a campaign in the @entity12 that has seen people encouraged to have one tv - free day a week			1
the 42 pages of guidelines are aimed at those who are in good health and not overweight			1
@entity10 says that obesity levels have risen to such an extent that men and women of a healthy weight are now in the minority			1
the average adult is a stone overweight and only 30 per cent of men and 40 per cent of women could consider themselves slim			0
some have questioned why @entity10 has produced such detailed guidelines for the healthy when there are more pressing issues			1
obesity rates have nearly doubled over the last ten years , according to professor @entity50 but professor @entity50 , director of the @entity51 at @entity10 , defended the guidelines , being emailed to doctors , councils and other groups			1
he said : ‘ obesity rates have nearly doubled over the last ten years and continue to be a huge concern			1
following a healthier diet and being more physically active is important for everyone , not just if you are already overweight or obese			2
‘ we all know we should probably take the stairs rather than the lift , cut down on tv time , eat more healthily and drink less alcohol			2
but it can be difficult to know the most useful changes that we can make			0
’ @entity10 says that aside from encouraging a couch potato lifestyle , watching tv makes us more inclined to eat snacks due to constant adverts for food			1
those who have dinner in front of the television tend to eat more as they are distracted from enjoying the meal so feel less satisfied			2
the watchdog did not say whether families should introduce tv - free days monthly or one day a week – for example , at the weekend			1
but in the @entity12 some schools encourage tv - free tuesdays – or entire weeks without tv – with the time spent doing exercise instead			2
@entity88 of the @entity89 said : ‘ advice is one thing : getting millions of people to do what it says on the tin is quite another			2
‘ what should be done is that we should be educated into a healthy lifestyle at a young age			0
’ dr @entity100 , a gp and expert in obesity , said he hopes more of his patients would follow the advice			0
‘ we should n’t lose sight of the simple principle that prevention is better than cure , ’ he said			0
‘ the advice given , though at first glance it may appear simplistic , is actually based on sound evidence			0
’ a proposal to offer free weight loss surgery for the obese could lead to up to 100 deaths a year , a leading academic has warned			0
professor @entity116 , from @entity117 , @entity118 , also said it will cost the health service more than first thought			0
in july , @entity10 issued draft guidelines recommending weight loss surgery to almost one million obese adults with type 2 diabetes			1
but professor @entity116 , of the university ’s @entity126 and @entity128 , said that although the surgery was relatively safe , patients are high risk as they are obese			0
he said that statistically one in every 200 die , meaning that if an extra 20,000 patients a year have surgery – as predicted – there will be 100 more deaths			0
professor @entity116 also said @entity10 had failed to take into account the extra costs of monitoring the patients after surgery and extra operations to replace gastric bands , for example			2
experts claim the proposals would cost the @entity146 anywhere between £ 100million and £ 4.5billion , but professor @entity116 said care afterwards would add £ 14million			0
professor @entity116 , who has written an article for @entity150 , said it would be cheaper and more effective to put patients on low calorie diets .			0

@entity10 advised people to avoid eating meals in front of the television
the health watchdog said you should limit yourself to two hours of tv a day
cutting out meat as much as possible from your diet was recommended
the guidelines will be emailed to doctors , councils and other groups
obesity rates have nearly doubled over the last ten years
