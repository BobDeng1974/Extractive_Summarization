by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 30 may 2012 updated : 09:56 est , 30 may 2012 reunited : @entity1 with his grandfather 's @entity3 that vanished 30 years ago a @entity5 medal that vanished 30 years ago has been reunited with the soldier 's grandson after he spotted it on @entity8			1
@entity1 , 45 , said he was left ' flabbergasted ' when he came across the @entity9 awarded to his grandfather in 1919			1
the medal , and one other belonging to private @entity12 , had disappeared from the family home in @entity15 , @entity16 , but the @entity18 medal eventually found its way to a dealer in @entity21 who put it up for auction			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , says it was ' sheer chance ' that he found the medal on the online auction site with a starting price of just 99p			2
mr @entity1 , who works at the @entity32 , said : ' i could n’t believe my eyes when i saw my grandfather ’s name and regimental number come up as part of the description for the medal			0
' i had n’t been actively looking for it , but i ’d occasionally type my grandfather ’s name and the word ' medal ' into search engines to see what happened and out of sheer chance when i looked last week , there it was			0
' i emailed the seller to explain who my grandfather was and he sent me the medal for free , saying i had more of a claim to it than anyone			1
i ca n’t thank him enough for his kindness			0
' private @entity1 served with the @entity58 on the @entity59 from 1916 , serving in the battle of @entity61 in 1917 before being gassed by the @entity62			0
he returned to the army and served with the @entity65 forces who occupied the @entity67 after the war ended in 1918			0
honoured : private @entity12 , pictured on his wedding day in 1922 , was awarded the @entity5 medal in 1919 the medal ’s dedication ' @entity5 for @entity72 to 1919 ' is because under @entity65 common law the war ' officially ' ended in 1919			1
but the war took its toll and private @entity1 died in 1927 at the age of just 28 so mr @entity1 never got to meet the man whose medal he now owns			2
he said : ' my grandmother remarried and when her second husband died in 1981 we went to clear the house and the medals were missing			0
lost : private @entity12 's @entity5 medal , pictured front and back , had been missing for 30 years before his grandson @entity88 spotted it on @entity8 ' we do n’t know if they were stolen , sold or given away , but after 30 years i ’m absolute over the moon to be able to hold it			1
' around six million @entity93 were issued to @entity95 servicemen , with the recipient ’s service number , rank , name and unit engraved on the rim			0
private @entity1 ’s other missing medal , the @entity103 , was not amongst those being sold by the dealer			2
mr @entity1 , who moved to @entity26 with his wife @entity106 15 years ago , said : ' i ’m optimistic that it ’s still out there somewhere			0
i just hope it does n’t take me another 30 years to find it ! '			1
