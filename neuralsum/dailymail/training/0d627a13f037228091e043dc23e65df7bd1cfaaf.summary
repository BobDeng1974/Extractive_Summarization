by @entity0 published : 22:22 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 02:56 est , 6 august 2013 @entity1 's has admitted it employs 90 per cent of its staff in @entity5 on controversial zero - hours contracts			1
zero - hours contracts are often critised because they do not offer guarantee work and a stable income			1
under the terms employees agree to be available for work as and when it is required			2
contracts : politicians have called for @entity1 's to offer at least minimum guaranteed hours for the 82,800 people ( file picture ) politicians have called for the food chain to offer at least minimum guaranteed hours for the 82,800 people			1
@entity19 , a @entity20 mp who has campaigned to get rid of zero - hours contracts , told @entity22 : ' @entity23 could lead on addressing this issue			2
' there will be some employees working 20 to 30 hours a week , week in week out and it is indefensible not to put those people on contracts			0
' a spokesman said employees are asked during their application process to say which days they can work on and that although all hourly - paid members of staff are on the zero - hours contracts , they are still entitled to benefits			1
@entity1 's employs 92,000 members of staff in the @entity5 and introduced the zero - hours contracts in 1974			2
other chains which use zero - hours contracts include @entity42 but it said its stores were independently owned and terms and conditions were set by the franchisees			1
involved : a member of staff prepares food at a @entity42 , which also has franchises which give employees zero - hour contracts @entity54 , on the other hand , said all of its staff are on a minimum of eight hours guaranteed a week			1
earlier this week it was claimed one million workers may be on the contracts - four times as many as official estimates			0
' there will be some employees working 20 to 30 hours a week , week in week out and it is indefensible not to put those people on contracts ' @entity19 , @entity20 mp the contracts , which are increasingly popular with employers , mean firms do not have to pay staff during quiet periods but keeps them available on short notice for when they are needed			0
last week the @entity73 reported that 250,000 people were on this type of contract at the end of 2012 , which was a 50,000 rise in a year			0
but research suggests this is a massive underestimate , and that there is a hidden workforce who , in effect , have no guaranteed shifts or income – making childcare arrangements and planning finances almost impossible			0
according to a survey of 1,000 companies by the @entity91 , one in five employed at least one person on a zero - hours contract – or a million workers if the results were applied across the country .			0
