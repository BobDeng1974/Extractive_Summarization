by @entity1 reporter published : 04:14 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 04:52 est , 11 october 2013 one of @entity3 's killers was rehoused to a bail hostel just a few yards from a children 's play ground , it has been claimed			1
@entity3 , 31 , was released from prison in august this year with a fourth new identity after being hauled back to prison in 2010 for possessing child porn			1
but now it 's been claimed that authorities housed him in a bail hostel somewhere in the north of @entity18 , a short distance from a playground , to prepare him for life in the community			1
the revelation provoked fury from @entity3 's father			1
paroled : @entity3 , pictured left , after his arrest for the murder of @entity3 , right , in 1993 has been released to live in a bail hostel near a children 's park somewhere in the north of @entity18 , it is claimed ‘ @entity33 is a ticking time bomb just waiting to strike at children , ’ @entity36 told friends , according to the @entity38 ‘ i ca n’t believe the authorities would be so stupid as to put a convicted pervert and child killer near a kids ’ park ’ , he said , adding : ‘ his history speaks for itself how warped , violent and predatory he is and he is just let loose to pose a grave risk to youngsters again			1
’ the @entity47 refused to comment on the case			0
chilling : @entity50 footage showed @entity51 and @entity52 leading young @entity53 away by the hand in a @entity56 shopping centre @entity57 : @entity3 was found on a railway line where he was battered to death by @entity33 and @entity52 in 1993 @entity33 and friend @entity52 , both ten at the time , were jailed for eight years for sadistically killing toddler @entity61 , two , in 1993			1
the toddler was abducted from a shopping centre in @entity56 and subjected to a horrific attack near a railway line that shocked the nation			0
@entity3 was first released from prison in 2001 , at the age of 18 , and given a new identity to protect him from the risk of vigilante attacks			1
at the time , a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences			0
however , he developed drinking and drugs problems , and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer			2
when a probation officer visited his home in @entity82 in 2010 to discuss his fears that he could be in danger , he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer			0
the hard drive was later examined by police , who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children			0
@entity33 admitted that he had posed online as a 35 - year - old woman who had abused her eight - year - old daughter , and was returned to prison			0
@entity33 was first given a new identity when he and @entity52 were sent to a young offenders ' institution for murdering the toddler			1
a second new identity was created for him when he was released in 2001 , and he was given a third identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images			1
@entity33 left prison in september this year with a fourth new identity , taking the total cost of his secret identities to £ 1million			2
@entity36 's relatives were only given a message that he had been set free days after he was released , to protect his right to anonymity			2
and despite recommendations by an official review into how @entity33 was allowed to re-offend last time he was released , he has not been fitted with a new sat - nav gps tagging bracelet			2
the device would allow probation officers to remotely monitor his every move			0
former @entity120 mandarin sir @entity118 said the tag could stop him sneaking back to @entity122 – which he did repeatedly last time			0
under the terms of his release , @entity33 has been banned from trawling sex sites on the internet and once again ordered to stay away from @entity128			0
currently the gps tracker is only available in ‘ extreme ’ circumstances and , to the dismay of @entity53 ’s family , @entity33 has not been selected by officials to wear the device .			0

@entity3 , 31 , served eight years for murdering @entity3 in 1993
he was recalled to jail after being found with a stash of child porn
authorities released him again in august with fourth new identity
it 's believed they *re-housed* him somewhere in the north of @entity18
