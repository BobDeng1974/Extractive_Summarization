ahead of saturday 's mouth - watering clash between @entity2 and @entity3 , @entity0 spoke to @entity4 and @entity5 of live4liverpool to better understand the intense rivalry between the two sets of supporters has your opinion of @entity2 / @entity3 changed since the match last april – and what was watching that match like ? @entity4 : not really ! to be fair they played very well last season albeit with the advantage of only playing once a week and with @entity18 , who is clearly one of the best strikers in the world			1
but we all felt that they would n’t be able to continue that form and their challenge for the title this year			0
@entity27 slips on the ball as @entity29 bounces during @entity3 's 2 - 0 win at @entity2 in april @entity27 looks on after seeing @entity29 score to put @entity3 1 - 0 up at @entity31 @entity32 holds onto the ball as @entity27 rushes to restart the game with @entity2 losing at @entity31 obviously it was pretty tense as all the big matches are , but there were moments of pure hilarity seldom experienced at a football match , such as @entity27 ’s slip for @entity29 ’s goal ; @entity2 ’s increasing desperation with frequent 30 yard shots ; @entity45 passing to @entity46 for the second goal and @entity32 ’s subsequent celebration with the @entity3 supporters after it , and the knowledge that we had well and truly ruined @entity2 ’s party ! @entity5 : not at all			1
i respect they did what they needed to get a result but that 's all			2
it was one of the most painful games to watch - you could literally feel the title slip away over 90 minutes			1
what is it about @entity2 / @entity3 you dislike so much ? @entity4 : how long have you got ? their sense of entitlement rankles most – just because they were a great side for 10 years in the 70s and 80s their belief that they deserve respect and have a divine right to win			1
@entity2 fans wave flags and banners during the 2 - 0 defeat to @entity2 the obvious media love in around @entity2 lauding the so called ‘ greatest supporters in the world ’ and their constant wallowing in ‘ history ’ compounded by their constant jibes at us for having ‘ no ’ history and being all ‘ plastics ’			1
all clubs have history and all clubs have a proportion of ‘ plastic ’ fans			0
they ’re arguments are farcical			0
dt : i liked @entity3 in the late 90s but they were really the first of the ' new money ' clubs and everything about the club just feels ' false '			2
they 're also very privileged and those plastic flags , well			0
. the less said are these the fans you ca n't stand more than anyone else in the league ? @entity4 : that ’s actually more difficult than it sounds – it very much depends on how old you are and where you grew up – some @entity3 supporters will always say @entity114 are the fans they ca n’t stand most and some might say @entity116 ; others go back to the rivalry with @entity119 , whilst new supporters might say @entity121 or even @entity122			1
i was a teenager when @entity2 were winning everything so that has always grated , but there is no doubt the bitterness has been accentuated by the frequent big games we had with them during @entity32 ’s first stint , and the issues around @entity132 – that and their clear enmity towards us in recent years			1
i can remember a time when they were n’t bothered with us , probably as we posed no threat then			0
@entity132 managed @entity2 for six years ( left ) before an interim spell at @entity3 @entity2 fans display a banner playing tribute to @entity132 after his return to @entity2 with @entity3 dt : to be honest , it 's a toss up between them and @entity116 for me			1
@entity145 fans can be insufferable after derbies but a lot of friends and family are @entity150 and it 's usually more harmless but those two sets of fans are known for being a little nasty			0
how many @entity2 players would get in your side ? @entity4 : none – well maybe one or two in the @entity3 women ’s team ( laughs ) how many @entity3 players would get in your side ? dt : maybe more than i 'd like to admit , at present			1
@entity161 or @entity162 in an instant , and i 've also been a long - time admirer of @entity165			2
@entity166 could be the difference in any midfield battle , while @entity169 has matured into one of the best midfielders around			0
so i 'd take 3 - 4 - but not @entity171			1
i think he 's very handy but i do n't think he 'd suit our style			0
like @entity174 , he 'd slow things down too much			0
watched him do that for @entity177 at the @entity178 ! @entity169 has been in stunning form for @entity3 since signing from @entity180 in the summer @entity171 has scored nine goals in eight @entity183 games for @entity3 will @entity2 win the @entity183 under @entity184 ? @entity4 : no – @entity18 and last season was his chance			1
he has a lot to learn in terms of navigating a season on four fronts ( especially in managing a @entity192 campaign and challenge for the @entity183 )			0
the fact that he has perhaps spent the @entity18 cash unwisely and failed to address @entity2 ’s defensive issues hint at an arrogance and tactical naivety that could be his fatal flaw			2
dt : i 'm torn but i 'd like to think @entity184 has a bit more about him than he 's given credit for so , yes			0
he may be a bit egotistical but look at where an ego has got @entity32			2
you do n't get anywhere at the top end of the game without one any more			0
will @entity3 win the @entity183 this year under @entity32 ? @entity32 directs his players during training on friday as they prepare to take on @entity2 @entity184 shows off his shooting skills during training at @entity213 on thursday @entity4 : there is a way to go yet but i ’m feeling pretty confident			1
@entity217 clearly wants it and so far we have been the best team in the league			0
@entity222 looks to losing the plot at @entity224 , @entity221 has a lot to do to repair the inherent damage at @entity116 , @entity121 and @entity227 still have n’t learned their lessons and are flat - track bullies at best , and @entity2 are a shadow of last year without @entity18			1
i am confident we will be champions but i do n’t like counting my chickens ! ! dt : at the moment , who has the players or ( in @entity122 's case ) the form to stop them ? i think they 're definitely favourites but all it takes is one or two injuries , suspensions and they 're in the same boat as everybody else			2
they 've got the squad to cope but i think there 'll be one or two twists and they might be run away with it the way people are expecting .			0
