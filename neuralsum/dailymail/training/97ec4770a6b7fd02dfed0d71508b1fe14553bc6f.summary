@entity1 ’s iconic captain @entity0 has given his blessing to @entity3 taking the job full - time after he retires and advised the key to good leadership is building one - to - one relationships with team - mates rather than screaming and shouting in an attempt to show authority			1
@entity0 , 34 , expressed his delight that @entity3 was last week named the club ’s vice-captain with a view to eventually carrying the armband on a permanent basis			1
the current skipper believes he and 24 - year - old @entity3 share common values more significant than geography , with the younger man growing up in @entity21 170 miles from @entity22			1
@entity0 speaks to manager @entity23 during @entity1 's defeat to @entity25 @entity0 insists he will have no concerns passing the @entity1 captaincy over to @entity3 ( @entity28 ) @entity0 said : ‘ i think i see a lot of similarities between myself and the way i go about things day - to - day , and how @entity3 does it as well			1
‘ i ’m not an in - your - face captain shouting for the sake of it in the dressing room			2
all these captains that rant and rave and try to knock the paint off a dressing room door , it is a load of nonsense			0
what matters is how you perform every day in training and matches , and what constructive information you can give your team mates one - to - one			2
that is what is important as a captain			0
‘ @entity3 epitomises everything a captain is			1
he leads by example , never gives up and works just as hard without the ball as with it			0
‘ we are good mates on and off the pitch and i would love nothing better than passing over the armband to him when i call it a day here , not just because he ’s a great player but also a top lad			0
‘ he comes from a great family , a similar family to mine , so it ’ll be a very proud day when i hand it over			0
’ @entity3 has won over @entity69 doubters who questioned if he was worth £ 18million @entity0 claims the pair share a lot of similarities in terms of leadership style position : midfielder born : @entity77 17 , 1990 , @entity21 clubs : @entity21 , @entity80 ( loan ) , @entity1 debut : nov 1 , 2008 @entity81 vs @entity21 apps : 230 goals : 19 @entity85 debut vs @entity86 , nov 2011 caps : 15 honours : @entity90 winner 2012 @entity0 ’s career as a local @entity1 lad made good is legendary whereas @entity3 went through a tough time when he arrived at @entity69 in the summer of 2011			1
initially , he was considered over-priced at £ 18million and former @entity95 manager sir @entity96 even mocked his running style			0
@entity0 thinks overcoming the difficult start , and winning over doubters in @entity100 , have helped to prove @entity3 has the qualities to be a captain			1
‘ he came to a huge football club like @entity1 as a young lad			2
he ’s not the first person who has taken time to settle in , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but i always knew watching him in and around the training ground that if he kept his head down , it would turn for him			0
fans take to players who give 100 per cent even when things are n’t going well and eventually they come round			0
when the pressure was on @entity114 and the fans were on his back , he dug deep and worked even harder			0
a lot of players give up and end up falling down the leagues and going to clubs that are not as big because they ca n’t handle the pressure			0
‘ but he showed through thick and thin that he is prepared to dig deep and go in where it hurts to turn these fans round			0
’ @entity3 takes a shot against @entity127 during @entity1 's opening @entity130 victory @entity3 could also be in line to eventually replace @entity132 as @entity85 captain @entity3 is also now an @entity85 regular and will be one of the candidates to captain his country after @entity132			1
@entity0 also gives his deputy credit for helping him to adapt to a deeper - lying midfield role			1
‘ @entity3 has been great for me , especially at my age , ’ he said			2
‘ what a story it will be if he becomes @entity1 ’s full - time captain			1

@entity0 has no concerns passing @entity1 captaincy over to @entity3
vice captain @entity3 has won over doubters after a difficult start
@entity0 sees similarities between the pair in terms of leadership style
@entity3 could eventually replace @entity132 as @entity85 captain
