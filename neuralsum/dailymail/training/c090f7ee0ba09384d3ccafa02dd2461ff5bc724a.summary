by @entity0 published : 23:04 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 05:56 est , 29 november 2012 outspoken : @entity2 mayor @entity1 sparked a row by criticising @entity4 over its tax contributions @entity2 mayor @entity1 has said that not paying enough corporation tax has left internet giant @entity4 with a pr headache			1
mr @entity1 said that by paying more tax the biggest multinational companies would be showing ' a greater commitment to society '			1
the mayor sparked a row with the company after he singled it out for criticism in a speech to businessmen last week where he said it was ' absurd ' that large corporations are getting away with minimal tax contributions while poorly paid workers are forced to pay increasingly higher levies			2
and his comments were met with a fierce rebuke from the company 's vice president @entity26 who hit out at @entity1 for not doing enough to support technology companies			1
he also attacked the mayor for ' not getting his facts right ' by claiming @entity4 paid " zero " tax when it paid £ 6 million on @entity34 sales of £ 2.5 billion			0
the row comes as mr @entity1 continues a six day tour of @entity37 which is aimed at boosting trade links with @entity2 and the @entity34			1
apart from @entity40 , @entity39 is the emerging silicon valley of @entity37 and mr @entity1 specifically visited the city to promote stronger links between it and @entity2 's expanding high - tech industry			1
but the outspoken mayor stood by his initial criticisms , claiming @entity4 had a pr problem			0
he said : ' my point is very simple : we all need @entity4 , we all love @entity4			0
but here 's the thing , it seems to me the point stands			0
' you either change your tax arrangements or , as i have repeatedly said , great corporations that live and work and profit from the society that they are in should do a little bit more			0
rebuke : @entity4 vice president @entity26 attacked mr @entity1 for not doing enough to support technology firms ' people do n't have to change			1
it 's perfectly correct that the law as it stands can be used in that way			0
' they have got a pr problem and the way to address that , because people feel a company like @entity4 makes shed - loads of money , is by showing a greater commitment to society			2
' the spat started when mr @entity1 spoke to members of the @entity79 last week			2
he said then : ' we should have taxes that are low but fair and it is absurd to be suddenly whacking up taxes on cash - poor people who happen to inhabit expensive houses in @entity2 when firms like @entity4 are paying zero			2
on tour : the row comes a mr @entity1 is in @entity37 on a tour aimed at improving trade links with @entity2 and the @entity34			1
he is pictured here with members of the @entity95 cricket team whom he met on the tour ' neither arrangement strikes me as being fair and so @entity4 and co face a very clear choice - they can either change their tax arrangements or do much more to serve our society by visibly taking on 18 to 24 - year - olds who are out of work			0
' but speaking to @entity109 last night , mr @entity26 said the mayor should look at the ' broader contribution ' made by @entity4 to the economy , which included the support of start - up companies			1
he added : ' it 's frustrating that the mayor of @entity2 , who is a great champion of the financial services industry , is n't championing the technology sector , which has the chance to provide the next wave of growth for @entity2 and the @entity34			0

the @entity2 mayor has started a row over tax with @entity4 after he said big companies should be making a ' greater contribution to society ' through bigger payments
@entity4 vice president @entity26 hit back by *accusing* mr @entity1 of not doing enough to support technology companies
but mr @entity1 stood by his criticism saying that not paying enough tax has left the company with a @entity138 headache
