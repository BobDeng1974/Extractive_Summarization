while death camp wardens and @entity3 officers were being tried at @entity4 in the aftermath of @entity6 , the @entity0 was putting other former nazis on the payroll			0
it has been revealed through recently disclosed government documents and interviews that at least 1,000 ex-nazis were recruited by the @entity0 military , @entity14 and @entity15 to become @entity17 spies and informants , the @entity9 reports			1
not only did they hire former @entity22 members suspected of carrying out war crimes , they went so far as to help their spies immigrate to the @entity0 and cover up their involvement in the war in an attempt to protect them from the @entity30 's own @entity22 hunters			1
and that estimate is considered conservative by the historians who were tasked by the government to declassify the war - crime records			1
' information was readily available that these were compromised men			0
' records reveal that these spies and informants were recruited from every level of the fallen @entity22 regime , from @entity45 officers to @entity63 's own mentor and ' master race ' proselytizer			2
in the 1950s , at the height of the @entity17 , longtime fbi director @entity66 and @entity15 chief @entity67 were in agreement that these former nazis would be more helpful to the @entity0 as @entity72 spies than in prison			1
in @entity76 , @entity75 officials trained @entity22 officers for a possible invasion of @entity79 while in @entity81 an @entity51 guard was hired to study @entity72 - bloc postage stamps for possible hidden messages			1
in @entity85 , a former top adviser to @entity37 himself gave classified briefings on the @entity72 while @entity88 officers living in @entity89 lay surveillance cables and tracked train movements			1
however , the records also showed that many of these @entity70 ended up not being effective spies , and some were even double agents			1
one of the more senior nazis recruited by the @entity0 was @entity97 , who was connected to the mass murder of 60,000 @entity99 in a @entity101 ghetto			0
war criminal : the @entity15 knew of @entity97 ' possible connection to the mass murder of @entity99 in @entity105 , @entity106 , but they hired him anyway to become a spy in @entity89 in 1952			1
four years later they helped him move to the @entity0 ( his immigration picture on the right ) above , a view of the ghetto in @entity105 , @entity106 where nearly 60,000 @entity99 stayed before their deportation to death camps @entity97 also worked for the @entity15 after the war , and the agency even wrote in documents their knowledge of his war crimes			1
they wrote that @entity97 worked ' under the control of the @entity3 during the war ' and that he ' was possibly connected with the shooting of @entity99 in @entity105 '			0
@entity97 was hired to spy in @entity89 in 1952 , and the agency paid him $ 1,700 a year and eventually helped him immigrate to the @entity0 four years later			1
he lived here for forty years before he was discovered in 1994 living outside @entity124 , and prosecutors moved to put to deport him			0
a @entity15 lawyer called the @entity30 telling them ' you ca n't file this case			2
' the @entity15 and @entity30 allegedly came to an agreement that @entity130 would not be put on trial if the agency turned over their evidence showing the former @entity22 was turned into a @entity0 spy			1
ultimately , they let @entity130 get deported before making public their embarrassing past of hiring ex-nazis			0
and even though they wrote about his involvement in the liquidation of the @entity141 in internal memos , their official comment was that they were not aware of any war crimes			1
' there is no evidence , that this @entity146 was aware of his wartime activities , ' the @entity15 said in a 1995 statement			2
another senior nazi turned - @entity0 - spy was @entity152 , who was a mentor and top aide to @entity63 - one of the masterminds of the @entity155			2
despite writing papers on how to terrorize @entity99 , the @entity15 hired @entity157 as a spy in @entity159 and eventually moved his family to @entity161 in 1954 as ' a reward for his loyal postwar service and in view of the innocuousness of his [ @entity22 ] party activities '			1
but when @entity63 was captured living in @entity168 in 1960 , @entity157 feared he too would be exposed and put on trial as a conspirator with the creator of the ' @entity172 '			0
the @entity15 however reassured @entity157 that they would protect him , and he did live freely in the @entity0 for another 20 years before @entity22 hunters tracked him down and moved to deport him from the country			2
@entity157 agreed to give up his citizenship in 1981 , and he died a few months later			0
@entity157 's son , 75 - year - old @entity177 , is critical of his father 's post-war counter-intelligence career			0
' they used him , and he used them , ' @entity180 told the @entity9			0
' it should n’t have happened			0
he never should have been admitted to the @entity0			0
it was n’t consistent with our values as a country ' none of these ex-nazi spies are known to be alive today			0
@entity63 's man : @entity152 ( left ) was a mentor and top aide to @entity63 ( right ) , one of the masterminds of the @entity155			0
he was hired by the @entity0 to spy in @entity159 in the aftermath of @entity6 he lived in the @entity0 for more than two decades before he was discovered by @entity22 hunters and deported			2

newly disclosed government records indicate the @entity15 and @entity14 ignored potential war crimes when they hired these ex-nazis in the 1950s and 1960s
turned @entity70 performed a variety of spy tasks from training for a possible invasion of @entity72 to laying *communication* cables in @entity89
