@entity1 chairman @entity0 claimed @entity3 's decision to promise an in - out referendum before knowing what powers can be clawed back from @entity6 means the cart is very firmly before the horse ' @entity1 could quit @entity11 if @entity12 leaves the @entity13 , its chairman has warned in a swipe at @entity3			1
@entity0 claimed the @entity17 leader 's decision to promise an in - out referendum before knowing what powers can be clawed back from @entity6 means the cart is very firmly before the horse '			1
he suggested large firms like the supermarket giant could move their head offices from @entity11 to other sites in @entity26 ' relatively painlessly ' , should @entity12 exit the @entity13			1
the @entity17 election manifesto includes the promise of an in - out referendum by 2017 , but only after reform of @entity12 's membership			1
it states : ' it will be a fundamental principle of a future conservative @entity33 that membership of the @entity13 depends on the consent of the @entity12 people – and in recent years that consent has worn wafer - thin			1
' that ’s why , after the election , we will negotiate a new settlement for @entity12 in @entity26 , and then ask the @entity12 people whether they want to stay in the @entity13 on this reformed basis or leave			1
' @entity3 has committed that he will only lead a government that offers an in - out referendum			2
we will hold that in - out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect the outcome			2
' but in an interview with the @entity51 , mr @entity0 warns this approach risks backfiring , because it commits to a referendum regardless of whether a better deal has been struck with @entity6			0
he suggested that a better approach would have been to lobby for reforms first , and then set a date for a referendum			0
he said : ' logically , you would have started with ' these are the reforms we would like to see enacted within the @entity13 ' and then , at the end of the process , determine whether or not you 've made enough progress and then decide if a referendum is necessary			0
' he said the idea that a referendum will be held in 2017 if a @entity17 government comes to power next month could have a real impact on people 's investment decisions			2
' it 's a question of weighing up the pluses and minuses			0
this issue of the @entity13 referendum and the uncertainty that it creates and the possibility that it could lead to @entity12 leaving the @entity13 is a particularly heavy kind of pebble to put in the scales , ' he told the paper			1
@entity3 , pictured today , has promised to renegotiate @entity12 's membership of the @entity13 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017 mr @entity0 , who described his political leaning as being ' pretty close to the centre ' , was not among the more than 100 senior business leaders who signed an open letter last month praising the @entity33 and warning that @entity91 could ' put the recovery at risk '			1
he said he did not think it was advisable to ' choose sides ' as firms will have to work with whichever party or parties form the next government			0
mr @entity0 also warned the political parties to be careful in their approach in dealing with the issue of immigration , saying they had been ' spooked ' by @entity105 into making declarations on the issue			0
' there are problems ... that need to be sorted out , but i think the answer is not to lock the door and throw the key away , ' he said			0
labour leader @entity114 issued a plea to @entity17 voters worried about leaving the @entity13 to back him instead			0
in an interview with @entity119 he said : ' i am a politician of the left , but i am positioned where the mainstream of politics is positioned			0
i am on the centre ground of politics , ' ' i want to reach out to @entity17 voters , to @entity129 voters , to @entity105 voters , to non-voters ... to people who feel that @entity3 ca n't answer the challenge of our time , who worry about our place in the @entity13 , who really think to themselves , ' we can do a lot better as a country '			2

@entity0 suggested @entity1 could *easily* move its @entity142 out of @entity11
@entity3 has promised to renegotiate @entity12 's membership of the @entity13
an in - out referendum on the outcome of the talks would be held by 2017
