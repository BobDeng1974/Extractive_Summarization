@entity0 are continuing to monitor @entity2 coach @entity1 amid growing concern over their faltering season			1
the @entity6 champions slipped seven points behind leaders @entity11 after saturday ’s 1 - 1 home draw with struggling @entity10			1
@entity13 ’s side are now in danger of finishing the season empty - handed after going out of both domestic cup competitions in the early rounds			2
much will depend on how they fare in the @entity19 having scraped through to the knockout stage			0
@entity1 is being monitored by @entity0 as their season continues to falter @entity13 's @entity10 side have not won in their last four and have fallen seven points behind @entity11 @entity23 league champions @entity2 beat city rivals @entity24 4 - 0 in @entity25 over the weekend 7 - after just nine years in management @entity1 has already won seven major honours — including @entity25 , the @entity28 and @entity29			1
64.3 - his win percentage in his three - and - a - half seasons as @entity2 manager			1
4 - the number of times @entity1 ’s @entity2 have beaten arch - rivals @entity24 this season			1
they have also had two draws			0
on february 24 @entity10 face @entity37 for the second season in a row and another defeat for @entity13 would raise serious questions over the @entity44 ’s future			1
@entity1 led @entity2 to the @entity23 title last season as well as the @entity19 final , where they lost to rivals @entity24			1
his stock rose even higher after @entity2 inflicted a 4 - 0 defeat on @entity52 ’s @entity51 champions in saturday ’s @entity2 derby			1
the 44 - year - old @entity54 is the likely target if @entity10 feel @entity13 should go			1
both @entity52 and @entity57 ’s @entity56 are less likely to leave their clubs while @entity60 ’s @entity59 is having a poor season			0
@entity10 ’s immediate task is to improve their results , starting at @entity64 tomorrow			1
@entity65 , the champions ’ @entity67 full back , admits his side must win at the @entity70 or risk losing touch with @entity11			1
@entity65 ( left ) believes that @entity10 could rediscover their form by playing away from the @entity73 @entity10 striker @entity74 has found that his goalscoring touch has deserted him during recent matches ‘ we are under pressure			1
we have to win every game , ’ said @entity65			0
‘ @entity11 won and @entity80 won , @entity81 are close behind us , while @entity82 are in a great moment			1
‘ every game is like a final , and we have @entity19 coming up in the next few weeks			0
if we want to be trying to retain the title , we need to win the games			0
’ @entity13 ’s team will not find it easy — @entity64 won at the @entity73 in august — and @entity65 admitted : ‘ they play in a physical way , and are very strong at home			2
‘ they have changed their style of play with @entity94 , but still have most of the players from a few years ago , and are a really good team			0
we have to be ready			0
’ @entity65 admitted that playing away from the @entity73 could help @entity10 rediscover their form			2
‘ it ’s been very strange because this team have not been great at home , and that is something that has not happened before , ’ he said			2
‘ we have always been strong at home , and this season if you look at the points we have lost at home , it is really hard to understand			2
’ much could depend on whether @entity74 rediscovers his scoring spark and @entity65 said : ‘ we need @entity74 to come back to his goalscoring best like in november - december			0
@entity10 will try to end their winless streak when they play @entity64 , who are managed by former boss @entity94 ‘ but after being injured for a long time for some players it is difficult to come back to their best			2
i am sure as soon as @entity74 scores one goal then he will again be one of the best strikers in the league			0
‘ also , defensively we are not doing great			0
we are conceding goals every game			0
clean sheets are always important			0
there are defensive and offensive things we need to improve if we are to win something this season			0

@entity0 were held to a 1 - 1 at home by @entity10 on saturday
they have now drifted seven points behind league leaders @entity11
@entity1 's @entity2 's won 4 - 0 against @entity24
