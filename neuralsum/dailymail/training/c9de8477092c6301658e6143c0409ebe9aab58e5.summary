during this investigation @entity6 did not release any detail around what had or what had n't been located			0
' it was important throughout that the integrity and professionalism of the investigation remained intact			0
' but suspicions remain that @entity97 continues to cast a long shadow , encouraging police forces to be more secretive than ever			0
