the game , created by @entity3 , looks like its predecessor but instead features a man with a helicopter helmet , who must dodge gates and swinging hammers in order to survive			1
a journalist at the publication said the game is ‘ hard , ’ and that players have to tap a smartphone screen to keep their character airborne and move him left and right			2
the aim of the game is to fly through gates - just like in @entity3 - except they are arranged vertically so the pilot wants to get as high as possible , while avoiding swinging hammers			1
players score a point for every obstacle the pilot successfully passes			0
mr @entity37 , a 28 - year - old @entity38 - based developer , has a tough act to follow			1
his first game , @entity3 , was the most downloaded game in the @entity7 in january 2014 with more than 50 million players			2

however , after a glut of copy - cat games flooded app stores , the developer re-launched the original game			2
he is now about to release his second title - @entity58 - which is a similar design and features similar game play			0
critics may argue that the developer 's move of pulling his first game , was more of a press stunt than altruistic			0
a month after his success , mr @entity37 pulled the game because it ruined his ‘ simple life ’ and he announced on @entity72 : ‘ i 'm sorry @entity3 users , 22 hours from now , i will take @entity3 down			1
