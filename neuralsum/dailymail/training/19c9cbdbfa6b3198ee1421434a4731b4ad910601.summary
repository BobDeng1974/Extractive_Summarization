the juice from uncooked chicken gives the germs responsible for food poisoning the perfect environment in which to multiply , scientists say			1
research by the @entity7 showed that the persistence of campylobacter - a group of bacteria that commonly cause food poisoning - is boosted by ' chicken juice '			1
organic matter exuding from chicken carcasses provides the bacteria with the perfect environment to flourish in the food chain			1
the findings , the researchers said , highlight the importance of cleaning surfaces during food preparation			0
new research has found the juices from a defrosted chicken give the germs responsible for food poisoning the perfect environment in which to multiply and they hope it will pave the way for new , more effective ways of cleaning that can reduce the incidence of campylobacter			1
the researchers collected the liquids produced from defrosting chickens			0
they found it helped campylobacter attach to surfaces and subsequently form biofilms			2
biofilms are specialised structures some bacteria form on surfaces , which protect them from threats to their environment			2
@entity47 , who led the study , said : ' we have discovered that this increase in biofilm formation was due to chicken juice coating the surfaces we used with a protein - rich film			1
' this film then makes it much easier for the campylobacter bacteria to attach to the surface , and it provides them with an additional rich food source			1
' campylobacter are not a particularly hardy species of bacteria , prompting researchers to understand exactly how they manage to survive outside of their usual habitat , the intestinal tract of poultry			0
they are sensitive to oxygen , but during biofilm formation the bacteria protect themselves with a layer of slime			0
this also makes them more resistant to antimicrobials and disinfection treatments			0
@entity62 , pictured under the microscope , is the group of bacteria commonly associated with causing food poisoning			1
they are not very hardy and are usually found in the intestinal tract of poultry understanding this and how campylobacter persists in the food production process will help efforts to reduce the high percentage of chickens that reach consumers contaminated with the bacteria			2
although thorough cooking kills off the bacteria , around 500,000 people suffer from campylobacter food poisoning each year in the @entity97			2
reducing this number , and the amount of infected chicken on supermarket shelves , is now the number one priority of the @entity104			0
ms @entity47 , said : ' this study highlights the importance of thorough cleaning of food preparation surfaces to limit the potential of bacteria to form biofilms			0
' the study was funded by the @entity112 .			0

juice from defrosted chickens gives germs the perfect environment in which to multiply , new study has found
@entity62 is the bacteria that commonly causes food poisoning
study found chicken juice helps campylobacter attach to *kitchen* surfaces
once attached they grow a resistant film which helps protect them and provides a food source which allows them to grow
