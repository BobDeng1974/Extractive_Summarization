by @entity0 published : 13:43 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 13:59 est , 1 november 2013 adults were to play @entity2 64 for 30 minutes a day over a period of two months while some people might think getting engrossed in a video game is a waste of time , scientists have found they can increase the size of our brains			1
@entity13 researchers found video gaming causes increases in the brain regions responsible for spatial orientation , memory formation and strategic planning as well as fine motor skills			1
they believe the benefits of video gaming may also prove helpful in therapeutic interventions targeting psychiatric disorders			0
in order to examine how video games affect the brain , scientists from the @entity25 and @entity26 , asked adults to play @entity2 64 for 30 minutes a day over a period of two months			2
a control group did not play the game and the researchers measured brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity38 ) scans			0
they found that in comparison to the people who did not play video games , the regular gamers showed increases of grey matter , in which the cell bodies of the nerve cells of the brain are situated			1
this growth was seen in the right hippocampus , right prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum			0
@entity13 researchers found video gaming causes increases in the brain regions responsible for spatial orientation , memory formation and strategic planning as well as fine motor skills scientists studied mri images to investigate which areas of the brain were enlarged these parts of the brain are involved in functions such as spatial navigation , memory formation , strategic planning and fine motor skills of the hands and the changes were most noticeable in participants who were eager to play the game			1
' while previous studies have shown differences in brain structure of video gamers , the present study can demonstrate the direct causal link between video gaming and a volumetric brain increase , ' said study leader @entity83 , senior scientist at the @entity84 at the @entity25			2
' this proves that specific brain regions can be trained by means of video games , ' he added			2
dr @entity83 and her colleagues believe that video games could be used as therapy for patients with mental disorders , in which brain regions are altered or reduced in size , such as schizophrenia , post-traumatic stress disorder or neurodegenerative diseases such as @entity100 ’s dementia			0
psychiatrist @entity101 , co-author of the study at @entity26 , said : ' many patients will accept video games more readily than other medical interventions			0

a study by the @entity115 asked adults to play @entity2 64 for 30 minutes a day over a period of two months
it found the gamers showed increases of grey matter , in which the cell bodies of the nerve cells of the brain are situated
