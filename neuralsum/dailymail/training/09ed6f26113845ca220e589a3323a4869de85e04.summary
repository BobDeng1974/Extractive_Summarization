by @entity0 published : 09:35 est , 12 december 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 13 december 2012 the oldest known representations of a @entity2 dating back as far as @entity3 have been found carved on rocks near the @entity5 in southern @entity6 , a new study claims			1
researchers say the engravings on rock faces in the desert four miles north of the @entity12 are the earliest found indication of royal power in the country			1
the images of a @entity2 riding boats with attendant prisoners and animals offer a window on @entity21 , they say , and show the moment @entity22 was first captured by the rule of a single monarch			1
the royal boat procession : this image , heavily damaged in recent times , shows the earliest known image of a ruler wearing the ' @entity30 ' , one of the earliest symbols of @entity34 dynastic power traced : the researchers copy of the carving shows the detail of the picture more clearly ' it 's really the end of pre-history and the beginning of history , ' study researcher @entity39 , of @entity40 , told @entity46			2
researchers found seven carvings around the area , many of which are tableaux of boats flanked by prisoners			2
on of the most extensive shows the earliest known image of a ruler wearing the ' @entity30 ' , one of the earliest symbols of @entity34 dynastic power , as he travels in ceremonial processions and on sickle - shaped boats			1
falcon and bull insignia on the @entity2 's boat indicate royalty , which is emphasised by by the four men standing alongside it holding ropes - most likely to tow it along the @entity5			2
the cycle of images is said to be the first with hieroglyphic annotation , with one on this particular scene labelling it a ' nautical following '			0
this the researchers say , is likely related to the royal and ritual event known as the ' following of @entity79 ' , a biennial tax - collection tour made by the royal court to stamp its authority on the country			1
symbolism : these are animal representations , with mythological animals on the right the same picture as it appears after being traced by the researchers a general view of both tableaux : the site was discovered in the southern @entity34 desert , 4km north of the @entity12 other carvings include pastoral scenes of cattle herding and a cluster of animals , two of which appear to be mythical part - lion creatures			0
' the theme of catching and bringing up wild animals is most important for @entity22 times , ' the researchers said			0
' although archaeozoological studies show that hunting was only of marginal economic importance during @entity22 times hunting was part of the elite lifestyle , and slaughtering wild animals on the occasion of religious festivals or elite burials allowed the upper echelons of society to show their importance in real life			0
' other animals shown are familiar native @entity121 species , including ostriches , an ibex and a bull - the latter of which is shown ' dominating ' the animals around it and is said to be a royal symbol			0
another tableau shows people brewing and drinking beer , perhaps in reference to some kind of festival			0
this carving shows a boat with three men , probably prisoners , behind and slightly below the stern : researchers found seven carvings around the area , many of which are tableaux of boats flanked by prisoners first recorded in the 1890s by the archaeologist @entity149 , the carvings were lost to @entity150 until the @entity151 , when @entity34 archaeologist @entity152 found and photographed them , but never published his work			1
it was after seeing one of these pictures that ms @entity39 led a team of international researchers that rediscovered them in 2008 , despite fears they had been destroyed in the interim the study published in the most recent issue of @entity165 is the first to offer a detailed description of the carvings			0
ms @entity39 told @entity46 that the style of the carvings and the kinds of hieroglyphics dated the images to between @entity173 and @entity174 , around the time of the reign of @entity177 who was the first @entity2 to unify @entity179 and @entity6			1
' it seems that for @entity177 it was important first to settle the situation in the @entity183 , to control the @entity183 , and then apparently move to the @entity184 , and at that time he unified @entity6 and we have the first dynasty , ' she said .			0

carvings on rock faces are the earliest indication of royal power in @entity6
they show @entity2 riding boats in what is thought to be tax - collecting tour
first found in the 1890s , they were rediscovered in 2008 and have just been described in a *scientific* *journal* for the first time
