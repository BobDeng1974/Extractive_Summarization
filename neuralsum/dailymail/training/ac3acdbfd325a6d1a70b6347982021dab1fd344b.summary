about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in @entity2 following the 2003 invasion but the @entity4 chose to keep the findings top secret , it has emerged			1
an investigation by @entity8 has revealed that @entity10 forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads , shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011			2
but the information was n't made public as embarrassingly the weapons , many of which had been built in close collaboration with the @entity20 , had been sitting dormant since the 1980s and so did n't support president @entity22 's rationale for going to war			1
at least 17 @entity10 troops were also seriously injured discovering and attempting to destroy the deteriorating shells filled with nerve and mustard agents			2
5,000 chemical weapons were found in @entity2 but the public was never told hidden : between 2004 and 2011 soldiers found thousands of rusty chemical munitions throughout @entity2 , most of them buried prior to the 2003 invasion by coalition forces , president @entity22 and @entity43 prime minister @entity42 had said the mission was ' to disarm @entity2 of weapons of mass destruction , to end @entity50 's support for terrorism , and to free the @entity2 people			1
' but all the weapons found had been developed before 1991			2
most of them were mustard agents in 155 - millimeter artillery shells or 122 - millimeter rockets developed by @entity50 during the @entity57 which raged between 1980 and 1988			0
another reason for the cover - up , according to @entity58 , was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the @entity10 '' nothing of significance ' is what i was ordered to say , ' said @entity67 , a now - retired @entity69 major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war			1
secrets : in 2002 president @entity22 said @entity50 was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load			1
chemical warfare specialists had to be called in , and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions			0
' i could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear , or i could just make it disappear myself , ' one ex-soldier told @entity58			0
the mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated			0
however , handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries , which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time			2
many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals , believing them to be regular old artillery			0
weaponry : this file picture dated 31 december 2000 shows @entity2 president @entity50 holding up his rifle during a military parade at @entity36 's @entity109 square at least 17 @entity10 military personnel and seven @entity2 police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases			1
many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation , exposing the soldiers to the potentially - lethal fumes			0
symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge , seething blisters			0
@entity126 , a former @entity69 sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company , joked of ' wounds that never happened ' from ' that stuff that did n't exist '			0
' i love it when i hear , ‘ ' oh there were n't any chemical weapons in @entity2 '' , ’ he said			2
' president @entity22 , together with strong support from then @entity43 prime minister @entity42 , left , claimed that @entity50 was in possession of weapons of mass destruction in 2003 in march 2003 , president @entity22 received a mandate from the @entity146 to lead an invasion of @entity2 , asserting that @entity2 was in violation of @entity149			1
with strong support from @entity43 p.m. @entity42 , the @entity22 administration claimed that @entity50 and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to @entity10 security and that of allies including the @entity43 and @entity156			1
after investigation following the invasion , the @entity10 led @entity159 concluded that @entity2 had ended its nuclear , chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion , but that they intended to resume production if the @entity2 sanctions were lifted			0
although no active chemical weapons program was found , at least 17 @entity10 troops and 7 @entity2 police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded			1
president @entity22 later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was ' the intelligence failure ' in @entity2 , while the @entity175 found in 2008 that his administration ' misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from @entity2 '			1
the @entity10 completed its withdrawal of military personnel in december 2011 , during the ninth year of the war			1
the rise of @entity183 means that the @entity10 will send an army headquarters to @entity2 for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group			0
a @entity190 soldier loads materials discovered in an explosives laboratory hidden in a home april 15 , 2003 in @entity36 , @entity2 @entity10 secretary of state @entity194 ( centre ) is greeted as he arrives at @entity196			0
he 's in the country to discuss @entity199 's nuclear program			0

an *estimated* 5,000 chemical weapons were found in @entity2 between 2004 and 2011 , it has been revealed
@entity4 chose not to release the information to the general public for several embarrassing reasons
the weapons did not meet @entity22 's rationale that @entity50 had a program of ' mass destruction '
most had been developed by @entity50 's forces during the 1980s and had been built in close collaboration with the @entity20
at least 17 @entity10 military personnel were injured *due* to the *mishandling* of the weapons
@entity22 has described the ' intelligence failure ' over @entity2 as the greatest failure of his presidency
