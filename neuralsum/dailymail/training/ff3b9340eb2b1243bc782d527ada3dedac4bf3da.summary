former guides expressed their surprise at the decision , saying there should be no distinction between the sexes			2
tv presenter @entity25 said : ‘ i ’m amazed to hear that car washing is prohibited for @entity5			0
i ca n’t think what the rationale for that can be in this day and age			0
my daughter earned money in the school holidays as a young teenager by car washing			0
if it ’s ok for the boys , how can it not be ok for the girls ? ’ the guides ’ website lists other activities in which its members can not participate – even though @entity15 can – such as bungee jumping , paint - balling and laser games			1
it even says the 550,000 members of the @entity48 organisation , whose motto is be prepared , should not be involved in shooting at human or animal - shaped targets , and includes a veto on fights with water pistols			1
the website states that the banned activities are deemed to be either too dangerous or go against the spirit of the organisation			1
under a section headed @entity60 : prohibited activity , it says the ban is ‘ due to the insurance implications to @entity48 regarding the possible damage to vehicles			1
’ the guides declined to comment in more detail , despite repeated approaches by @entity70 for more information			2
@entity48 spokesman @entity72 said : ‘ we do n’t allow car washing for purely insurance reasons			1
thousands of girls and women take part in a variety of activities in guiding safely every year			2

the company says that in some cases , scouts have been to blame for causing damage , citing one occasion when ‘ a bucket of water was placed on the bonnet of a car and pushed across the shiny surface ’			1
yesterday , scout leader @entity108 , who works with youngsters in @entity110 , said : ‘ car washing is one of our main fundraising events and will help pay for us to go to the scout jamboree in @entity117 next year			0
we identify activities that young people want to do and whether it is appropriate to do them			0
‘ it ’s a case of learning life qualities			2
we might get the @entity15 to do the wheels and tyres , as that ’s what they can reach and do safely			0
the older scouts would do the bodywork because they are able to focus more and are taller			0
‘ our organisation is becoming very popular with girls because of all the exciting activities we do			2
’ part of the membership fees for the @entity15 ( £ 21 a year ) and the @entity5 ( £ 11.80 a year ) goes towards paying the annual insurance premiums for their activities			0
the guides were founded in 1910 after a group of girls gatecrashed a @entity15 rally and begged the founder of the organisation , lord @entity140 , to let them set up their own , similar , movement			1
those aged 15 years and over have been allowed to join the @entity15 since 1976 , while girls of any age have been welcomed since 1990 .			0
