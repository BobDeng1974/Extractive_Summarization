with the band : fans can now show seasonal appreciation for @entity22 and slayer with these @entity7 jumpers but they 're not all as festive as they first seem with the slayer version emblazoned with skulls and pentacles and a @entity28 knit with snow flakes resembling barbed wire and upside down crosses that @entity31 may find offensive			1
