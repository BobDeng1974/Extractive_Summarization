@entity6 vector control officials said in a statement on tuesday that the mosquito that goes by the nickname ' @entity10 ' has been found in @entity11 and nearby @entity12			2
the discovery of the ‘ @entity15 ’ mosquito in @entity3 is the first time an @entity1 mosquito has been discovered in the @entity18 the mosquito can transmit the non-fatal @entity21 and @entity22 viruses to humans , though neither has ever been reported in the county			1

the discovery of the zebra - striped mosquito , also known as ' @entity10 ' has been identified in @entity3 for the first time in the @entity18 the insect 's @entity1 identify was confirmed by scientists from the @entity33 using pictures which showed its distinctive black - and - white stripes on its legs and body			1
clinical lecturer and mosquito researcher at the @entity33 , dr @entity41 , told @entity42 that mosquitoes appearing in other locations around the world have become an increasing problem			1
' this is one of the most widespread mosquitoes in @entity1 and , as well as being a nuisance - biting pest , ' dr @entity41 said			1
' we will never know for sure how they got to the @entity18 but these types of mosquitoes are found in urban areas - not one has been found in wetlands			2
dr @entity41 encourages people to wear insect repellent spray outside and empty out all containers filled with water in the backyard ' mosquitoes are often found in backyards and they prefer to lay their eggs in smaller containers of water			1
' my theory is people could have moved their belongings , along with mosquito eggs found in them			2
' alternatively , in extreme cases , it could have been a group of them that have flown on a @entity76 plane for instance and then flew off when they arrived there			0
' but it could 've been anything really - movement from a commercial kind of product like plants or industrial equipment , which carried their eggs overseas			0
but it 's a remote chance - a remote possibility that could 've happened			0
' the zebra - striped mosquito has been known to transmit non-fatal @entity22 and @entity21 viruses to people in @entity1 , which have influenza - like symptoms but neither has been reported in the country			1
' mosquitoes have to bite someone first , to be able to catch the virus but the chances are really slim , ' he said			0
' we ca n't guarantee that someone would get a virus because it all depends who and what they 're biting - people or animals who are carrying the disease			2
' they are a risk to dogs and have known to spread heart - worms in @entity1 but if pet owners get their pets vaccinated , they have nothing to worry about and their pets would be safe			2
' the insect was initially captured in june in @entity12 and @entity11 , but officials were not able to confirm it until this week			0
' it 's great how this situation demonstrates how we were able to work with the @entity18 authorities through a quick email and some high resolution photographs to be able to identify the specimens , ' dr @entity41 said			1
the @entity133 tiger ( pictured ) was first found in @entity3 in 2011 and can carry more dangerous diseases , including the dengue fever , chikungunya , and viruses , and other diseases dr @entity41 said : ' @entity3 is battling with another species - the ' yellow fever ' ( pictured ) which i think is a higher concern that they should be looking at ' dr @entity41 said he encourages people to empty out any containers that are filled with water in their backyard and use insect repellent spray at all times when spending some time outside			1
he added : ‘ @entity3 are battling with two more different species - the ' yellow fever ' season mosquito and ' asian tiger ' mosquito , which i think is a higher concern that they should be looking at			0
' the @entity133 tiger was first found in @entity3 in 2011 and can carry more dangerous diseases , including the dengue fever , chikungunya , and viruses , and other diseases			0
‘ this situation has demonstrated a concern and reminder to the @entity1 authorities and they need to be mindful of how easy they ’re being exported to other countries			0
‘ there have been reports of new discoveries of mosquitoes in countries like @entity174 , @entity175 , and @entity176 – so what ’s stopping them from making their way here ? ' he said .			0
