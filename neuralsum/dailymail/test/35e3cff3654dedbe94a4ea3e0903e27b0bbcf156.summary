you could be forgiven for thinking it was a perfectly sensible message about personal safety			2
but a police poster advising women to stick together on a night out provoked anger yesterday , as campaigners claimed it suggested victims were responsible for sex attacks			1
@entity9 was accused of ‘ victim - blaming ’ in its campaign , which urges women not to leave their friends alone or let them wander off with strangers			1
women ’s rights groups said rapists were to blame for sex attacks , not their victims			1
anti-rape campaigners have criticised the message in this @entity9 poster arguing it implies that victims are to blame for getting raped but the poster won praise from supporters who said it was ‘ blindingly obvious ’ that it was not blaming women , and that it simply offered ‘ sensible advice ’			1
it features a picture of two smiling young women posing for a selfie , with the text : ‘ which one of your mates is most vulnerable on a night out ? the one you leave behind			1
’ it goes on : ‘ many sexual assaults could be prevented			0
stick together and do n’t let your friend leave with a stranger or go off on their own			2
’ but anti-rape campaigners said police should target potential attackers instead , and that the poster sent a message that women needed a constant chaperone			1
@entity50 , acting director of the @entity51 , said she found the advice ‘ infuriating ’			0
she added : ‘ we need to get beyond police campaigns giving instructions to women on how to behave to be safe			1
we need to talk to those who may perpetrate rape and deter them			0
’ campaign : the posters are due to be put up in pub and club toilets as well as bus stops in @entity65 ( pictured ) as well as other areas of @entity9 a pair of police officers watch on as @entity70 students gather on the street outside a bar in @entity65 @entity74 , of the @entity75 ’ @entity73 , said : ‘ @entity9 has made great strides to encourage people to report sexual violence and there is the possibility this could damage people ’s confidence			1
‘ we are here to support anyone who has been the victim and will not judge anyone – it is never the victim ’s fault			0
’ chief inspector @entity89 said the police had a responsibility to advise potential victims on how to minimise risks but @entity94 , a former special constable who is running for re-election as @entity97 mp for @entity98 , said he thought the poster offered ‘ common sense advice ’ , adding : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s blaming victims ... it ’s like telling people to lock car doors			1
i would say the same to young men , not to leave their mates behind in what could be a dangerous area because they could get robbed or sexually assaulted			2
‘ it ’s disappointing that some groups do n’t realise police are trying to help prevent problems			2
‘ no one ’s suggesting the attacker does n’t bear responsibility , the police are simply trying to make sure people are aware of danger and try to avoid it			0
’ @entity122 , who is standing as the @entity97 candidate in @entity124 , agreed			0
‘ i ’m quite sure that @entity9 in no way intended to imply that women are somehow responsible for any attack , ’ he said			1
‘ this is an entirely sensible campaign			0
’ @entity9 said the posters would be put up at bus stops and in pub and nightclub toilets			2
chief inspector @entity89 said : ‘ rape is never a victim ’s fault , but as with all crimes we can reduce the number of victims in several ways			0
‘ it is vital to be aware of vulnerability so that steps can be taken to guard against it			0
’ in 2012 @entity145 were forced to apologise for posters for its @entity148 initiative suggesting rape victims were to blame if they were drunk @entity150 were praised by anti-rape groups for their 2014 @entity153 anti-rape campaign which carried the strapline : ' drinking is not a crime			0
