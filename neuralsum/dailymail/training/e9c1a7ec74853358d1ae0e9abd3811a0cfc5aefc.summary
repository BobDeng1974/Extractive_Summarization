stand - in captain @entity0 has no concerns about his unusual status within the @entity4 squad			1
@entity0 will lead his country in the @entity6 , starting against @entity7 at the @entity8 on friday , and will continue throughout the @entity9 if regular skipper @entity10 can not prove his fitness by february 21			1
but should @entity10 be ready to return by that deadline , @entity0 faces the probability of dropping out of the side to make way			1
@entity0 ( left ) looks on as captain @entity16 celebrates scoring a half century for @entity4 @entity0 is filling in as @entity4 captain , but might not make the @entity9 team if @entity10 is passed fit unless form or other fitness issues intervene , @entity0 is expected to be behind @entity10 's test deputy @entity21 and former vice-captain @entity22 in the pecking order , making him vulnerable to @entity10 's return			1
' does it bother me ? not at all , ' said @entity0			2
' we have probably more captains in the side at the moment than you can poke a stick at , which is a wonderful position to be in			0
i think every person who is playing , regardless of any other positions , will just be looking to perform to make the case for retaining them within the @entity37 pretty compelling			0
' @entity0 is hardly an untested leader , having captained 24 of his 52 odi matches due to @entity10 's fragile body			2
' i think the regularity of it has probably made it easier for me than what it would be otherwise , ' he said			0
' unfortunately it has happened quite a bit over the last 12 months			0
' it is something that we have been used to as a team , having to deal with not having a player like @entity10 in the side			2
' i think we have responded pretty well when that has been the case			0
' as @entity9 co-hosts , @entity4 are desperate for @entity10 to play his part in the tournament			1
@entity0 ( left ) is also captain of the @entity57 in @entity4 's @entity58 @entity0 believes that @entity10 is heading in the right direction with regard to recovering from injury in time he netted in @entity63 with the team on thursday and all signs are positive that the 33 - year - old is heading in the right direction			1
' @entity10 has been with us doing his training stuff and his rehab stuff around us for the last couple of days , ' confirmed @entity0			2
' i think he is really happy with how he is progressing , so that is all positive			0
' ( he is ) very confident as you can imagine			0

@entity0 filling in as @entity4 captain while @entity10 is injured
@entity10 has been *hampered* by *hamstring* and back *problems*
if he recovers for the @entity9 , @entity0 is expected to exit the team line - up
