by @entity1 reporter @entity2 has now admitted more needs to be done to embrace older viewers he is the first to admit he is guilty of being besotted with chasing a youth audience			1
but @entity6 executive @entity2 has now confessed ‘ the simple truth , not be resisted ’			1
it is the older age group who drive viewing figures and they need to be given programmes they have an appetite for			1
from the @entity16 ’s hit drama @entity14 in @entity17 , a love story between elderly @entity19 and @entity20 , played by @entity21 and @entity22 , to the box office smash hit film @entity25 which tells the tale of pensioners looking for a warm place in @entity29 to retire , are recent examples of the tremendous value of the @entity33 vote			2
now @entity6 is to follow suit with the launch of it ’s new family entertainment show @entity37 which will be hosted by 69 - year - old veteran presenter @entity38			2
the programme will see young contestants take on some of the country ’s most talented pensioners and the decision to commission the show is a reflection of how important it now is to tv bosses that they are seen to embrace older viewers			1
a point not lost on mr @entity2 as the director of programmes for @entity6 he is regarded as the arbiter of what the nation views and has now admitted more needs to be done to embrace older viewers			1
in an interview for the @entity58 he said : ‘ the simple truth , not to be resisted is that as people go through life they watch more television			2
there ’s no point in swimming against the tide			1
so we make programmes that appeal to that audience – though not at the expense of others			2
‘ mr @entity2 admits there was a point when television was once fixated with youth			1
he said : ‘ it looked as if it was the way tv was going			1
but it was never going that way , to be absolutely honest			0
and all those people who watched yoof tv - an expression you never hear these days – are probably watching gardening programmes now because they are no longer young			1
’ according to statistics most of the people ( 54 per cent ) watching @entity85 are over 55			0
@entity88 ’s audience is even older – 59 per cent over 55			1
@entity89 is broadly the same , though they are less public with their figures			0
mr @entity2 ’s views are echoed by presenter @entity92			1
the former newsreader said he had also noticed a turn in the tide for elderly presenters and stars			0
he said : ‘ older presenters were cut down in droves , much as you would prune the raspberries to make way for new growth			1
fair enough , in my view , though many cried " ageism ! " and several went to tribunals			0
@entity6 is to launch a new family quiz show @entity37 which will be hosted by 69 - year - old veteran presenter @entity38 ' presenter , in any case , is a very recent job description dreamt up to describe somebody who fronts a programme without any special reason for being on it			0
' and if you got the job in the first place mainly because you look nice , i ca n’t see why you should keep it when you do n’t			0
' as the wonderfully acerbic @entity122 said , " the viewers do n’t want to watch ugly			0
' she seemed to say it through gritted teeth , or at least a flawless but strangely taut face – a sign perhaps that she had taken her own advice to stop complaining and work on staying attractive			0
' but now – again suddenly , again when i was looking the other way – the media worm has turned			0
we ’re trendy – sorry , cool – again			0
‘ @entity132 , 79 , is the new @entity133 , @entity134 , 75 , will front the next election for the @entity16 in preference to the not - so - young pretender @entity137 , 52 , and i defy you to switch on any programme , on any channel , without coming face to face with @entity38 , 69			0
' the old faces are back on tv , and not because they ’re facing historical sex offence charges			1
’ ' it ’s turned around on a sixpence , ' @entity145 , the veteran agent with many of those older faces , as well as quite a few young ones , on her books			1
' a couple of years ago , if you went in with an idea for a show with older presenters aimed at older people , they would laugh like hyenas and show you the door			2
now that ’s all changed			0
they ’ve realised they ’ve been ruling out programmes people want to watch			0
' miss @entity38 , one of her clients , agrees : ' i wake up every morning thinking how extraordinary it is – to be 69 and still working on tv			2
' @entity168 has at last realised you need maturity and experience alongside youth and beauty			2
it ’s finally come of age			0
