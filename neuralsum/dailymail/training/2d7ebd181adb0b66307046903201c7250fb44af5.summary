by @entity0 published : 20:40 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 05:00 est , 11 march 2014 immigrants have much better educational qualifications than people born in @entity5 , a new study yesterday found			1
it said that more than a third of people who were born abroad have a degree or qualifications of the same level - but only just over a quarter of @entity5 - born people			2
at the other end of the education scale , nearly one in four @entity5 - born people left school with no qualifications and have achieved none since			2
but fewer than a fifth of immigrants have no academic achievements at all to show			0
a study found that immigrants have much better educational qualifications than people born in @entity5			1
pictured , students at the @entity26 the high education levels of those born abroad provide fresh evidence to explain why employers are anxious to fill jobs with immigrants rather than native - born workers , and keen to keep migration doors open to maintain the supply of better - qualified labour			1
the study , by academics at the @entity38 , suggested that immigrants have better qualifications because some have been gained abroad , because many arrive as students at @entity5 educational institutions , and because migrant groups have over a 20 - year period overtaken native @entity5 in educational achievement			1
researchers used information gathered by the national census in 1991 , 2001 and 2011 to check the educational levels of people born in different countries and from different ethnic groups			0
study author @entity56 said : ‘ over the last twenty years , educational attainment has been increasing among ethnic groups as a result of an improvement in access to education overseas and the increasing proportion of ethnic minority people educated in @entity5			1
’ the report said that people from @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 background were ahead of white @entity5 people in educational achievement			1
file picture the report said that people from @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 background were ahead of white @entity5 people in educational achievement , and that @entity76 and @entity77 who have long lagged behind are catching up			1
the only ethnic group left far behind are those classed as white gypsies or @entity81 travellers , among whom six out of 10 have no qualifications and fewer than one in 10 a degree or equivalent			0
it found a wide educational gap between people born in @entity5 , and those born abroad , who are counted by statisticians as immigrants			1
the differences were most marked among young people , who include those who came to @entity5 as students , and those who came as young children and pursued education in @entity5			2
‘ the differences in educational attainment between younger and older groups are more pronounced for those born outside the @entity5 , ’ the study said			2
the only ethnic group left far behind are those classed as white gypsies or @entity81 travellers , among whom six out of 10 have no qualifications and fewer than one in 10 a degree or equivalent			0
file picture ‘ across all ages , over a third of people born outside the @entity5 had degree level qualifications compared with a quarter of people born in @entity5			0
similarly , the foreign born population were less likely to be without any qualifications than the @entity5 born population			0
’ it said that young @entity76 and @entity77 immigrants under the age of 24 were four times less likely to be without qualifications than people born in those countries aged in their 50s and early 60s			0
more than four out of 10 young @entity68 have a degree , partly because of high numbers who study in @entity5			1
@entity130 and @entity131 migrants are less likely to have degrees but many have other qualifications from their home countries , the report said			0
the study , by the @entity136 at @entity137 , said : ‘ a comparison of the 1991 , 2001 and 2011 censuses suggests that all ethnic groups experienced improvements in educational attainment over the last 20 years			0
‘ these improvement reflect , to a large extent , improved access to higher education , particularly among women			0

high achievement may explain why employers want immigrants
students of @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 families overtake white @entity5
one reason is many immigrants come to @entity5 to study
