by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor the @entity1 @entity2 said tuesday that @entity4 firms can challenge an @entity6 mandate that forces employers to offer their staff free contraception as part of their health insurance			1
@entity13 , a crafting supply store owned by a family that also runs a chain of @entity4 bookstores , sued the federal government over @entity6 's requirement that every health insurance policy include coverage for the morning - after pill and intra-uterine contraceptive devices , without requiring pharmacy co-payments from consumers			1
now about 40 similar plaintiffs are involved , arguing that since their religious beliefs hold that human life begins at conception , they ca n't be forced to provide birth - control that prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in a woman 's uterus			1
that includes not providing employees with forms of contraception that they believe ends human life the @entity13 case wo n't revisit the legality of abortion , guaranteed in the @entity51 court decision , but it will likely determine whether a private company has to provide health insurance that includes drugs some groups see as ' abortion pills ' the @entity58 family closes all its @entity13 stores on sundays in observance of their @entity4 faith , but they say the @entity6 prohibits them from exercising other facts of their religious freedom @entity13 employs 13,000 people			1
its owners do not object to condoms , diaphragms and other forms of contraception			2
but they face fines of up to $ 1.3 million per day if they do n't provide their workers with a health insurance plan that complies with the @entity6 , beginning with the first day of a new insurance plan year			1
they have avoided paying the fine so far by shifting their group plan 's renewal date			0
@entity79 , another named plaintiff , objects mainly to the ' @entity82 ' contraceptive pill and other similar medications			1
the company is owned by a @entity86 family			0
@entity87 , a @entity88 company that makes auto parts and medical equipment , objects to the law because its owners are @entity92 and oppose all forms of birth control			2
in dueling press releases , the @entity96 administration and conservative activists sparred over the arguments that the high court will likely hear in march			0
@entity101 , an anti-abortion group , focused on what it called the administration 's ' abortion - drug mandate			0
' the group 's president , @entity106 , said in a statement that ' [ w ] e applaud the @entity2 for taking up this case addressing our fundamental freedom of religion and conscience , during the debate over the @entity6 , @entity1 were assured that these rights would be honored , but as @entity6 is rolled out , we see this is simply not the case			2
' plan b : this ' emergency contraceptive ' is really an abortion drug , many @entity4 groups claim			0
they object to @entity6 's requirement that all health insurance policies cover the pills @entity127 president @entity106 warns about threats to @entity1 ' ' fundamental freedom of religion and conscience ' @entity132 press secretary @entity131 said tuesday in a statement that ' [ w ] e believe this requirement is lawful and essential to womenâ € ™ s health , and are confident the @entity2 will agree , ' referring to the inclusion of contraceptives among the @entity6 's ' ten essential services			1
' ' the @entity140 has already acted to ensure no church or similar religious institution will be forced to provide contraception coverage and has made a commonsense accommodation for non-profit religious organizations that object to contraception on religious grounds , ' @entity131 said			1
not an issue ? condoms and other forms of birth control are n't part of @entity13 's objection , but one @entity92 plaintiff has a problem with being required to provide employees with any form of birth control but the issue before the @entity2 is whether private businesses , not churches and their related charities , can operate in a way that reflects their faith			1
@entity13 already shutters its stores on sundays and closes at 8:00 p.m. each night so its employees can be at home when their children go to bed			0
in a video produced in 2012 by the @entity171 , @entity13 co-founder @entity39 said her family 's religious faith is ' a part of our life that is â € “ we ca n't separate it from our work			2
' @entity58 , her husband and the company 's ceo , added that ' my convictions enter into how we run our business			0
' he said tuesday in a statement that his legal challenge ' has always remained about one thing and one thing only : the right of our family businesses to live out our sincere and deeply held religious convictions as guaranteed by the law and the @entity194			0
' ' business owners should not have to choose between violating their faith and violating the law			1
' in 1993 @entity198 passed the @entity199 , limiting the federal government 's ability to enforce laws that constitute a religious burden to @entity1			2
last year the 10th @entity1 @entity204 ruled that corporations can be equally protected by that law , writing that ' the contraceptive - coverage requirement substantially burdens @entity13			0
' the @entity1 @entity2 said it will decide whether religious freedoms trump the @entity96 administration 's desire to make sure all @entity1 have access to free birth control , regardless of where they work the @entity96 administration has already carved out exceptions to the law for churches and their charities , like this hospital , but no such help is available to private businesses owned by the @entity4 faithful the @entity96 administration argues that letting that ruling stand would remove health protections from citizens who happen to work for companies run by the religiously observant			1
in addition to deciding whether or not ' corporate persons ' can assert the 1993 law 's protections when they clash with other federal laws , the case could produce the @entity2 's first abortion - related decision since 2007 when it upheld the federal @entity235			0
different medical authorities disagree on the definition of a pregnancy			0
some , including the @entity239 , argue that pregnancy begins when a fertilized egg is implanted in the womb			2
the @entity243 and other like - minded organizations , however , say life begins at conception			1
' emergency contraception , ' they claim , can kill a living human being .			0

employers sued the government on religious grounds , arguing they should n't have to offer insurance that covers the @entity82 pill
the case will touch on the thorny *question* of whether life begins when sperm meets egg
the @entity132 does n't want religiously observant business owners to be allowed to limit their employees ' health care choices
the companies insist that they should be allowed to operate in accordance with their faiths
