‘ addiction is one long , drawn out scream for help			0
‘ the addict can be given all the love in the world if they are fortunate , but until they are able to come to terms with their own inner pain , they will continue to self - medicate			0
’ when asked if @entity3 ’ words should have been removed to avoid offence to the @entity3 family , her husband and children , @entity93 replied : ‘ who am i to censor @entity99 ’s work ? that would be creative vandalism			1
