a desperate mother has been told by a top judge that her teenage son can not live with her because she is an advocate of home schooling			1
the mother - of - four , in her 50s , says her son is being ' deprived of his liberty ' by being forced to attend a conventional school			1
she told @entity11 's @entity10 she had home - schooled the disabled teenager for 10 years , along with two of her other children			1
a judge at the @entity10 sitting at the @entity17 in @entity11 ( pictured ) has told a mother her teenage son can not live with her because she wants to home school him but , after he was admitted to hospital as an in - patient in 2011 , she was informed by @entity22 that the boy would not be allowed to return to the family home - because her alternative stance on education was ' not in his best interests '			1
she bitterly resisted the move , saying her son - referred to as ' t ' in court - is desperate to come home			1
but a family judge ruled earlier this year that the now 18 - year - old ' lacked mental capacity to make decisions relating to his welfare '			2
as a result , he was placed in residential care and enrolled as a pupil at a school 100 miles away from his family home			2
due to the judge 's decision that the boy was unable to make important decisions for himself , he was entitled to no personal say on where he lived and how he was educated - despite being clever enough to study @entity50 's @entity49 , his mother says			1
challenging the decision at the @entity10 , the mother insisted her son wanted to come home and that his views should be respected			1
representing herself before top family judge , @entity55 , she said her son , who has cerebral palsy , was suffering emotionally due to separation from his family as well as physically from not being cared for in the residential placement as well as he would be at home			2
' i say that my son can make decisions			0
he can decide where he wants to live , who he wants to see and his care needs			0
he has a clear memory and he is an adult , not a child			0
at 18 , he is past compulsory schooling age , ' she told the judge she added outside court that her son 's intellectual gifts far outweigh his physical abilities , to the extent that he was ' studying @entity50 last year			0
' @entity55 said : ' there is a question over whether the mother would enable @entity82 to obtain education			0
' the mother does n't fully support schooling and the judge had no confidence that she would ensure that @entity82 had his last year at school			2
' the mother says the judge misinterpreted the @entity91 and placed too much emphasis on her son going to school			2
' she argues it is wrong to force @entity94 to attend school now , after he has passed compulsory schooling age , and says that her son is being deprived of his liberty by being required to attend school , and that it is not in his best interests to do so			2
' but , dismissing the mother 's challenge , she added : ' the judge concluded that the education was good for him , was in his best interests and that he was happy at school			1
@entity82 's time at school is extremely important , educationally and socially			1
' the benefits of the schooling outweigh the difficulties of the placement in his current home			0
to attend his current school he has to live nearby , which meant staying in his current placement , even if there were shortcomings '			0
dashing the mother 's hopes of her son coming home to live with her , @entity55 concluded : ' the judge was entitled to come to the conclusions that he did and i can not identify any reasonable prospect of success on appeal			0
' outside court , the mother said she would fight on , adding : ' home schooling is a better method to meet individual needs			0
' we have home schooled him for 10 years			1
my son is a unique individual and his cognitive ability far outweighs his physical abilities			0
' he was learning @entity50 's @entity49 last year - how does that fit in with him not having capacity to make his own decisions ? '			0

@entity142 , in her 50s , home - schooled the teenager for 10 years
but when he was admitted to hospital , a *council* said he could n't go home
the authority said her stance on education was ' not in his best interests '
she bitterly resisted the move and *launched* an @entity10 challenge
judge in @entity11 rules today his time at school is ' extremely important '
