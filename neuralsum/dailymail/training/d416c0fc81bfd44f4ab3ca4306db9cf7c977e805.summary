the population of @entity1 is on the verge of reaching an all - time high , finally exceeding the @entity4 peak of just over 8.615m			1
the @entity5 estimates that the city will soon welcome its 8,615,246th inhabitant , the highest population since the eve of the war in 1939			1
as the population figure is based on @entity5 forecasts , experts do not when the exact peak will be - but some say it could even be today			1
population peak : the number of people living in @entity1 is on the verge of reaching an all - time high , finally exceeding the @entity4 peak of just over 8.615m the last peak in @entity1 's population was on the eve of the @entity22 in 1939			1
pictured : people enjoying lunch at the open air restaurant at @entity27 's fields in 1939 statisticians say the record - breaking @entity1 is likely to be born in the first few weeks of 2015 , in one of the capital 's outer boroughs where population growth rates are highest			1
the news represents an extraordinary turnaround for @entity1 , which lost more than 2million people in the world war and once had a population of just 6.6 million			1
the population is now forecast to continue at an annual rate of around 100,000 - the equivalent of a new borough every three years - with the population set to hit 10m by 2030			0
experts have warned that this could add massive strains to already stressed infrastructure , particularly housing and transport			1
the biggest pressure is expected to be on housing , with an estimated 42,000 new homes needed every year to keep pace with population growth			2
professor @entity53 , director of research group @entity54 , told the @entity56 : ' this is both good news and bad			0
on the one hand it is far better to be living in a city that people want to come to rather than a declining city			2
how @entity1 has changed : this map shows how @entity1 has expanded since 1939 age : this graph shows how the age of @entity1 's population has remained rather steady since 1939 , but that we now have fewer teenagers and more pensioners ' but there is always the risk that people will feel there is not enough space , not enough transport , too much congestion			1
' such a large population inevitably means substantial investment in roads , railway , hospitals and all the elements that make a city work			2
' clearly , there is not enough investment going into @entity1 at the moment			2
' @entity88 , director of planning consultancy @entity89 , said the peak comes after the city lost a quarter of its population - the equivalent of the inhabitants of @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 all leaving			0
writing about it on his blog , he said : ' @entity1 is back to its peak , and while it has changed in so many ways , it faces some of the same challenges			2
country of birth : this graph shows how many more people from other countries now live in @entity1 , compared to 1939 the tenure of @entity1 homes has also changed , with many more owning homes , despite the increase in housing prices ' just like 75 years ago we have extraordinarily fast population growth with commuting patterns and housing pressure spilling way beyond the city â€™s boundaries			1
' the last population peak came after two decades of massive growth			0
but it began to fall almost immediately after the outbreak of war in september			0
this was largely due to evacuations and conscription			0
even after the war , the population continued to decline , amid encouragement from planners for families to relocate			0
the last time @entity1 's population peaked was in 1939 , on the eve of the @entity22			1
but how different was the @entity136 's capital city back then ? currently , 13 per cent of people living in the @entity136 are @entity1 inhabitants , whereas the @entity1 population accounted for 18 per cent of the @entity136 in 1939			1
at that time , @entity1 was overwhelmingly white - only 2.7 per cent had been born abroad			1
today , around 37 per cent of @entity140 were born abroad			0
this shows pre-war areas in blue and post-war areas in red - the shape of @entity1 has not really changed in 1939 , with no @entity147 and heavy smog , life expectancy was 62			1
today , @entity140 can expect to live to 82			0
the population pyramid shows @entity1 now has fewer teenagers and more pensioners than in 1939			1
there are also have more adult men , due to a ' missing generation ' in 1939 , after the @entity155			0
in 1939 , statutory education only went up to age 14 , so most of @entity1 's secondary schools had yet to be built			1
before the war , only 2 per cent of people went to university and almost all of them were men			0
in @entity1 today , 43 per cent of people go onto university and the majority of them are women			1
although the number of people working in @entity1 has not changed greatly , the industries which cater for those jobs have			2
the newly - built areas of @entity1 in 1939 in blue , with the newly - built areas of @entity1 today in red in 1939 , around one in three people worked in manufacturing			2
now 90 per cent of these manufacturing jobs have gone and most people now work in industries that barely existed in 1939			0
these include 250,000 jobs in @entity182 , with another 250,000 working in hotels and restaurants			0
@entity185 's was the tallest building in the capital in 1939			0
now @entity185 's is only the 41st tallest building in the @entity1			2
the tallest building is @entity188			0
@entity190 prices have also grown extraordinarily			0
in 1939 , the average cost of a home was the equivalent of three years ' salary ; now it is around 16 years			0

@entity5 says 8,615,246th inhabitant will be born in 2015
will be born in one of city 's outer boroughs where growth rates are highest
shows extraordinary turnaround for @entity1 , which once had 6.6m people
experts fear growth will add strain to city 's already stressed infrastructure
