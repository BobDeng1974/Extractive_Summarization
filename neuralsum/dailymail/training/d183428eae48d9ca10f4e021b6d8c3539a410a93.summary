by @entity1 reporter published : 11:46 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 26 june 2013 most of us are happy to try a spot of @entity5 but there are n't many who would take on the challenge of building their own aircraft			0
these unusual looking planes are the creations of amateur engineers in @entity13 who have made their own jets - often just using scarp metal , a book guide and a lot of improvisation			1
despite their lack of material , training and money , these determined aviation - enthusiasts have managed to build their own machines			1
handmade : @entity26 , 24 , stands next to the helicopter he constructed in @entity28 , @entity29 , in 2007 creative : @entity30 , a 24 - year - old physics undergraduate in northern @entity29 , used old cars and motorbikes to build his own helicopter in his back garden @entity36 's aircraft , which he built in his front yard in @entity38 , is powered by an engine which was once used to mill animal feed			1
he sourced aluminum bars , bolts and plastic sheeting to make the frame - sticking it all together with some gum			1
while @entity47 trio @entity46 , @entity48 and @entity49 , built a helicopter from an old van engine and scrap metal with no financial support in 2010			2
they 'd hoped to use the plane to fight fires but it is unclear whether their machine ever made it off the ground			0
farmhand @entity62 managed to build a 25 - kilogramme helicopter from scrap material he salvaged from around his village in @entity67			1
according to the @entity69 , the 20 - year - old dropped out of school at the age of 12 and has no training in aviation			1
starting out : @entity74 can be seen welding the skeleton of a his helicopter out of scrap metal in 2007 opportunities : the homemade plane , which @entity26 completed in 2007 , earned him a scholarship to study aircraft maintenance in the @entity82 but , incredibly , @entity62 has managed to build a plane in just seven months , working around his full - time farming job			2
it is not known whether it can actually fly - but @entity62 says he has managed to get it a full feet off the ground			2
@entity62 said : ' i built the helicopter to showcase my talent , hoping that people would invest in me and give me an opportunity to build bigger and better things '			2
but shortly after @entity62 unveiled his helicopter earlier this year , his employer fired him claiming the media attention was interfering with his work while police have banned him from flying it , claiming it is a security risk			0
@entity102 , curator of @entity103 - an annual @entity105 event that showcases ingenuity and innovation , says aeronautical innovators in the developing world have fewer resources to bring their creations to life but just as much potential			1
innovation : it may look like a car , but @entity26 , pictured sitting in the front seat , used old car parts to make his own helicopter back to basics : @entity38 @entity36 built this plane out of aluminum bars , bolts and plastic sheeting he salvaged before sticking it all together he said : ' in any society , there ’s always a subset of individuals with an interest in tinkering , fabricating , mimicking , inventing			2
' at the very fundamental level , what drives them is curiosity			0
on top of that , it ’s problem solving , or addressing gaps they see in society			0
' but there are a few success stories - 24 - year - old physics student @entity29 @entity143 being one of them			0
he spent nearly a year building a 12 - metre ( 39ft ) long helicopter out of spare parts sourced from old cars , motorcycles , and even a crashed @entity150			0
he used money he saved from repairing cell phones and computers			0
his bright yellow contraption with a salvaged @entity156 engine was completed in 2007 and could actually reach heights of seven ft. his invention helped secure him a scholarship to study aircraft maintenance in the @entity82			0
growing number of inventors : @entity36 used an engine which once milled animal feed to power his aircraft pushing the boundaries : the curator of @entity103 , @entity102 , says @entity13 has just as much aeronautical talent but lacks the resources to support it			1

aviation - enthusiasts built the crafts despite lack of material , funds or training
