@entity33 , the @entity20 's head of external affairs , said : ' this is exactly the action we wanted to see as a result of the drop in wholesale prices that has taken place over the past couple of weeks			1

' the price of @entity49 oil has dropped following easing tensions in the @entity51 sparked by @entity53 and @entity54 negotiations over @entity55 he went on : ' now more than ever , motorists are struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis due to the cost of running a car so every reduction in price at the pump makes a big difference			2

@entity110 , uk , @entity93 , 14 hours ago the government should give a 25 % discount on petrol / diesel for people who use their car to get to work			2
they have us over a barrel , put the duty up and we have no choice but to pay it because we need to get to work , its extortion ! @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity93 , 15 hours ago @entity1 always leads the way with @entity126 it 's the same price in all their stores , unlike most supermarkets which vary prices in neighbouring areas we do n't have @entity1 in my hometown , but i frequently pass one in a neighbouring town and try to fill up @entity136 is currently 10p per @entity137 cheaper at @entity1 than one local filling station that 's a heck of a difference.in profits over a week of sales - thousands of litres sold as it 's on a busy main @entity143 have n't checked the current price of heating @entity146 wonder if that has also come down in line ? sadly if it has , we filled up in the summer when it is slightly less extortionate than in the @entity151 per litre less makes savings of approx Â£ 360 over the @entity153 to be sniffed at ! @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity93 , 15 hours ago why only a penny off diesel ? @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity93 , 15 hours ago why only a penny off diesel ? @entity158 , @entity159 , 16 hours ago best not waste petrol shopping there			1
@entity162 , @entity163 , 17 hours ago the government thought it was good to peg the various energy prices to one another so when oil goes up so does your gas and electricity - it means that it does no good trying to switch your dependency , they have boxed you in			2
i suggested a long time ago when they were ripping us off that we should harness the influence of the powerful and boycott the biggest petroleum seller in the @entity93 which would give a shot in the arm for the independent retailers and force the biggest " looser " to lobby the government to put things right but it did not take off and here we are ! remember boycott the pumps and all that waffle ? @entity162 , @entity163 , 17 hours ago @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity93 , 2 hours ago @entity187 , let the @entity188			0

. now they are no different !			0
. greedy two faced a holes are making millions out of us after conditioning us to buy from them ... i suggest to anyone who is serious in trying to bring down petrol / diesel costs ...			0
always be selective and find teh cheapest in your town / city ... never just fill up a the nearest ( and usually dearest ! ) ...			0
we are all selective in what prices we pay for food , clothes , holidays etc.			0
but yet 90 % of people just fuel up at the nearest station without even checking the prices !			0
. no wonder supermarkets can charge the same as teh local shell garage ...			0

if supermarkets want my business then they better be cheaper ! the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity235			0
