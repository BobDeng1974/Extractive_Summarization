and with it , the return of the hi - vis ball to the @entity3			1
with a chill in the air and the clocks going back , all ten of this weekend 's @entity3 ties , kicking off with @entity6 vs @entity7 on saturday lunchtime , will be using the new yellow and purple @entity13 ball			1
the white @entity18 ball was first introduced at the start of this season and , according to @entity21 , @entity13 ’s @entity22 , it was the result of more than six years ’ work			1
the new yellow @entity13 ball which is to be used in the @entity3 for the first time this season it 's official name is the @entity13 ball and it will be used throughout the winter ' the ball has been six years in the making , taking a lot of engineering work and validation , ' @entity21 told premierleague.com			1
' it is the first fuse - welded football			0
it consists of 12 fuse - welded panels in a three - layer casing system , and a poly - blend wrapped , free - floating carbon latex bladder			0
' for winter , the colour of the ball and the graphic detail on it are altered to maximize its visibility in darker conditions			2
and @entity21 believes the new @entity13 ball will help top @entity3 stars in those conditions			1
' studies have shown that that 70 per cent of matches played from october to february are under heavy clouds , rain and / or in the dark and under floodlights , ' @entity21 says			0
' we tested what players look for , and of their vision , only 10 - 15 per cent is used for direct vision , the rest is peripheral			0
@entity59 pair @entity58 and @entity60 have been training with the new ball on friday as have midfielder @entity62 and forward @entity63 ahead of their trip to @entity66 ' they are not always looking at the ball but need to find it in their peripheral vision quickly			1
so with the dark background of the crowds , the green grass and the bright perimeter boards we asked , " how do you make this ball stand out in this environment ? " ' the colour that contrasts best was yellow			2
then we found that the colour on the ball best for the players to see fastest how the ball is behaving , whether it is spinning and how fast was purple			0
' so that was how we came to have the ball emblazoned with @entity13 ’s @entity86 , or @entity87 , technology			2
the graphic pattern , which is unique to each league , creates a flickering effect as the ball rotates			0
' @entity94 forward @entity93 perfecting his touch with the new high - visibility ball as have midfield duo @entity97 and @entity98 ahead of their clash with @entity101 on sunday			0
