a @entity1 schoolboy who was born without fingers on his left hand has been given a prosthetic glove made to look like the hand of his favorite superhero @entity6			1
@entity7 had just a thumb and four small stubs but now proudly imitates the comic book herowith his very own fully - functioning glove			1
the five - year - old , from @entity13 , now picks up everyday objects with ease and he gleefully uses his new prosthetic fingers to help him count to 10			1
mrs @entity37 said she and her husband were told @entity7 was missing some fingers when she was just five months pregnant			2
the couple immediately began researching prosthetics and websites for children with similar hands to their unborn son			0
as the age of two @entity7 had surgery to remove his four little ' nubbins ' , so he would have a better gripping surface			2
mrs @entity37 said the disability did n't phase her son			0
she said : ' @entity7 is a phenomenal little boy and he has not been held back by anything			1

mrs @entity37 added : ' he wanted to be able to count to 10 on his fingers , wear gloves with his costumes , and be able to pick things up			0
' we are still tweaking the hand to make it just right , but @entity7 is very pleased with the @entity6 colors and black spider on the back			1
' @entity7 was given the glove in october after his family were put in touch with @entity75 at @entity76 - a team of volunteers who use 3d printing to make prosthetic limbs			2
she said @entity7 , pictured striking a fighting pose with sister @entity28 , ' is very pleased with the @entity6 colors and black spider on the back ' e-enable designs and builds 3d printers , but mr @entity75 said the company soon realized they could put their equipment to ' use for a good cause '			1
he said : ' it quickly became a group undertaking as soon as everyone here began to see how much of a difference we could really make			0
' it was one thing to know in an abstract sense that we made tools which give people the power and potential to create			0
' but it was a very different thing to directly see the end results of what that creativity could really accomplish , and the dramatic effects it can have on both a child 's life , and on their outlook for the future			0
' we went from simply making parts to making a difference - it changed our entire outlook on what we can do as makers			0

@entity7 was born with just a thumb on his left hand
but the ' phenomenal ' five - year - old never let anything hold him back
