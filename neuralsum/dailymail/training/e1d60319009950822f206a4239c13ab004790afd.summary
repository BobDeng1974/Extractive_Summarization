@entity9 's @entity8 and @entity10 believe the wind has been taken out of @entity13 's sales ahead of tomorrow 's @entity15 final against @entity16 after @entity18 's side were beaten by @entity19 in midweek			1
@entity8 , who has won the competition three times , said : ' psychologically that defeat was a major blow coming into the cup final			1
@entity18 has a great chance to win something tomorrow but @entity16 look pretty dominant at the moment			2
' watch the below video to see what the fans joining @entity8 and @entity10 think of the cup final and sir @entity33 's decision to step down after 27 years at @entity34			1
. tune in and watch the debate from the home of football this morning			1
@entity10 agrees with @entity8 after watching @entity13 slump to a 3 - 2 defeat at the @entity40			1
he said : ' tuesday night was a big game for them , if they 'd have won it they 'd have had a good chance tomorrow			0
' but i have to say they were poor on tuesday , they looked nervous and they made mistakes			0
' there was a huge feeling of deflation around the @entity40 and i think they may bring some of that here			0
' the pair then moved on to the story of the week : sir @entity33 's decision to step down at @entity59 and the subsequent appointment of @entity61			1
@entity8 believes that other clubs will think @entity34 are there for the taking , but noted that @entity61 should not be underestimated			1
he said : ' @entity61 is an outstanding candidate for this job			2
' but their opponents will see it as a chance without that great man at the helm			0
' but @entity61 will be expecting to continue in the same vain			2
he added : ' @entity61 is the right candidate			2
there is a lack of @entity77 experience but i feel he is quite a pragmatic manager , he 's a thoroughly nice guy and he loves football			2
in the january of 2002 i was despatched from @entity80 to @entity81 to cover the final few months of sir @entity33 ’s reign at @entity34			2
little did anybody know back then that i – like everybody else – would have to wait more than a decade to do it			0

' he 's a student of the game but he has got to hit the ground running because the pressure will be on him if he does n't			0
' i expect them to continue that success that they have but i feel it is an opportunity to wrestle the dominance away from @entity34			0
' @entity10 has been covering @entity34 for a number of years , and offered a fascinating insight into sir @entity33 's relationship with the press			1
@entity10 said : ' it was an enormous challenge every day			0
you never really knew what you were going to get			0
whether he was going to be the grumpy , surly figure looking for a fight or whether it was the other side , amusing , entertaining , intelligent side			0
' you never knew what you were going to get			0
he did n't like cowards , but equally , if you stood up to him too much , he thought you were rude			0
' triumphs two and three : @entity8 celebrates the 2002 victory over @entity112 with central defensive partner @entity113 ( left ) and ( right ) showing off the trophy with @entity115 after defeating @entity116 in @entity117			1
