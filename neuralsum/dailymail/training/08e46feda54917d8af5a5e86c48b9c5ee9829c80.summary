a backpacker who suffered from persistent nosebleeds was horrified to discover they were caused by a three - inch - long leech which had been living up her nose for a month			1
@entity6 had been travelling around south - east @entity7 when she was involved in a motorbike crash			1
she had thought that a lump poking from the bottom of her nose was congealed blood from a burst blood vessel after the accident			1
but just days after returning home to @entity16 she was disgusted to find that it was the head of a huge leech which had set up camp in her nostril			2
she was horrified to discover her nosebleeds were caused by a three - inch - long leech up her nose after first trying to blow the leech out , and grab it with her fingers , the graduate , 24 , was rushed to @entity29 to have the creature removed with forceps and tweezers			1
miss @entity6 , originally from @entity34 , said : ' two weeks before i came home from @entity7 , i started having nosebleeds but i 'd fallen off a motorbike so thought i 'd burst a blood vessel			1
' after i got home , the nosebleeds stopped and i started seeing something sticking out of my nostril			0
i just thought it was congealed blood from the nosebleeds			1
' i tried to blow him out and grab him but i could n't get a grip of him before he retreated back up my nose			1
miss @entity6 with the leech that lived up her nose			1
after first trying to blow the leech out , and grab it with her fingers , the graduate , 24 , was rushed to @entity29 to have the huge creature removed with forceps and tweezers ' when i was in the shower , he would come right out as far as my bottom lip and i could see him sticking out the bottom of my nose			1
' so when that happened , i jumped out of the shower to look really closely in the mirror and i saw ridges on him			0
that 's when i realised he was an animal			0
' my friend @entity68 and i called @entity69 24 and were told to get to accident and emergency as soon as possible			0
' the graduate said : ' he had been curled up in a big ball , using my nostril as a little nest , so i called him mr @entity76			2
at one point , i could feel him up at my eyebrow ' she was whisked into a treatment room where a nurse and doctor examined her nose using a torch , forceps and tweezers			2
the doctor used a nose forceps to prise open her nostrils really wide while a nurse and her friend pinned her to the bed			2
miss @entity6 said : ' it was agony - whenever the doctor grabbed him , i could feel the leech tugging at the inside of my nose			1
' then all of a sudden , after half an hour , the pain stopped and the doctor had the leech in the tweezers			2
' he was about as long as my forefinger and as fat as my thumb			1
miss @entity6 had been in @entity107 when it is believed that the leech made its way into her nose via water ' he could move so fast as well , which freaked me out			1
i 've no idea how he got up there but he 'd have got bigger and bigger from feeding on my blood			0
' he had been curled up in a big ball , using my nostril as a little nest , so @entity68 and i called him mr @entity76			0
at one point , i could feel him up at my eyebrow			0
' i asked the doctor what would 've happened if i had n't gone to hospital and she said he 'd probably have worked his way into my brain			0
' @entity126 , curator at the @entity127 in @entity128 and an expert on leeches , said : ' @entity6 could have picked up this leech from water in @entity107 , if she had been swimming			2
' or it could have gone in through her mouth , as she was drinking water			0
' even though it was there for around a month , these leeches do n't grow all that quickly , so it would n't have been much smaller when it went up there			0
' it would have been quite sizeable			0
' it 's interesting that people do n't feel these leeches go up their nose			0
