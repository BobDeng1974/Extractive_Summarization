by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 10 april 2013 hidden information : lord @entity2 call for names of those arrested by police to be kept secret two senior judges yesterday called for secret arrests where the public would lose the right to know who the police detain			1
they said this is necessary because when an arrest is publicised it causes ‘ irremediable damage to the person ’s reputation ’			0
the demand for draconian rules – made on behalf of the entire judiciary – raises the spectre of a legal regime under which the targets of police raids could be seized and questioned while the public are kept in the dark			1
even families and friends would be held in ignorance and unable to help			0
free speech campaigners condemned the call as ‘ very dangerous ’ with the potential for ‘ great harm ’			1
earlier this week it was revealed that the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) is drawing up plans meant to apply across the country to prevent police forces from releasing the names of those they arrest			1
the latest intervention was made by two senior figures , @entity44 and mr @entity45			1
lord @entity2 presided in 2010 over the first serious criminal trial in 350 years to go ahead without a jury			2
the trial of four armed robbers sentenced to a total of 64 years in jail was excepted from usual democratic rules because of fears over jury - nobbling			0
mr @entity45 is the most senior high court judge dealing with libel and media law			1
the judges said they backed the conclusion of @entity60 in his report on press ethics that only in exceptional circumstances should details of those arrested or suspected of crime be made known to the public			1
they said police must consider the human right to privacy and added : ‘ the police arrest many people who are never charged			2
' if there were a policy that the police should consistently publish the fact that a person has been arrested , in many cases that information would attract substantial publicity , causing irremediable damage to the person ’s reputation			2
‘ even if the fact that the person was not charged were subsequently published , that would not receive the same publicity , and would not prevent subsequent internet searches disclosing that the person had been arrested			0
’ in the dark : mr @entity45 argue that when an arrest is publicised it causes ' irremediable damage to the person 's reputation ' and should therefore be kept from public knowledge the two judges said they were speaking ‘ on the basis of the judiciary ’s interest in the effective administration of justice ’			1
they said their opinion reflected the views of various judges including the president of the @entity105 sir @entity104 , whose courts deal with libel , the senior presiding judge @entity108 and @entity60			1
they added : ‘ it has not been possible , however , to consult all relevant judges			2
’ among a number of senior figures missed out of their consultations appear to be the lord chief justice lord judge , the most senior judge in @entity117 and @entity118 , who is on record as a strong supporter of freedom of expression			1
' the police arrest many people who are never charged			2
if there were a policy that the police should consistently publish the fact that a person has been arrested , in many cases that information would attract substantial publicity , causing irremediable damage to the person ’s reputation			2
even if the fact that the person was not charged were subsequently published , that would not receive the same publicity , and would not prevent subsequent internet searches disclosing that the person had been arrested			0
we adopt the words of @entity144 in his report : ‘ ‘ the current guidance in this area needs to be strengthened			0
for example , i think that it should be made abundantly clear that save in exceptional and clearly defined circumstances ( for example , where there may be a risk to the public ) , the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press nor the public			2
’ the judicial paper was produced as a response to the @entity166 , the government ’s law reform quango , which recommended last year that the @entity169 and @entity35 should develop a national system under which ‘ the names of arrestees will be released but that appropriate safeguards will need to be put in place ’			0
the judges replied that the law should ‘ protect the rights of suspects , defendants and witnesses , in particular their rights to reputation and privacy ’			2
they also raised the prospect of a new law which would allow those arrested and named in public to sue for compensation			0
‘ it may be that the civil law should be reformed to give a remedy for the publication of prejudicial information , in addition to the law of contempt , ’ the two judges said			0
they said exceptions to secret arrests would be ‘ only in exceptional and clearly defined circumstances ’ , for example when there is an immediate risk to the public			1
the move by the judges produced alarm among freedom of speech campaigners			1
@entity208 of @entity209 said : ‘ there are of course circumstances where it may be better not to release the names of people who are arrested			0
‘ but to set this up as a norm could prove very dangerous			0
the actions of the police must operate under the principle of open justice , and this includes arrest			0
the introduction of de facto secret arrests has potential for great harm			0
’ earlier this week @entity227 , the author of the @entity166 ’s report , said that ‘ it is imperative that we have confidence that our legal process is transparent			0
’ he added that it was ‘ not hard to imagine cases of clear public interest in which arrests should be reported ’			1
but @entity35 said that police chiefs were looking to protect the public in line with @entity60 ’s recommendations , and that under its new rules there will ‘ most likely be exceptions in the interests of justice and to prevent and detect crime ’			1
opponents of secret arrests say the suppression of information means that witnesses or other victims of a criminal will not come forward .			0

lord @entity255 and mr @entity45 want *anonymous* arrests
identity of those detained by police would no *longer* available to the public
free speech campaigners condemn senior judges ' ' very dangerous ' call
