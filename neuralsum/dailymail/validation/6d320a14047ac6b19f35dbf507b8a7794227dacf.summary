for the first time women are to get an advanced blood test to detect @entity3 ’s syndrome and other abnormalities in unborn babies on the @entity6			2
the non-invasive @entity8 test examines dna in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother ’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders			1
it will be offered at in @entity18 through the @entity6 and privately			0
the non-invasive @entity8 test examines dna in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother ’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad for processing			1
it is one of several non-invasive prenatal testing ( @entity30 ) examinations that promise greater accuracy for women at high risk of having a @entity3 ’s baby			0
eventually such @entity30 tests will be routinely used to reassure all pregnant women			1
current screening for @entity3 ’s on the @entity6 consists of the less - accurate ‘ combined ’ test , which uses ultrasound to measure the amount of fluid at the back of the baby ’s neck at 11 weeks , as well as a blood test			2
professor @entity46 , consultant obstetrician at @entity47 ’s , said the new test was the first to be regulated under the @entity50 ’s health and safety standards			0
he said : ‘ too many pregnant women have been through the anxiety and discomfort of invasive procedures after receiving false positive results [ women wrongly identified as being at risk ] from the combined test – the @entity8 test gives us the accuracy and reliability to reduce this number significantly			1
’ results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad a study by the @entity67 to check whether @entity30 should be offered routinely on the @entity6 is underway , involving five hospitals , and is due to report later this year			1
trials of another @entity30 test offering expectant mothers 99 per cent accuracy in screening for @entity3 ’s syndrome are being run by @entity74			0
@entity30 has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the combined test			0
this means fewer women will undergo unnecessary invasive follow - up procedures which are stressful and carry a small risk of miscarriage			0
dr @entity82 , ceo of @entity83 – the makers of the @entity8 test , said : ‘ we recognised the limitations in the current standard of prenatal screening and the huge unmet medical need for a regulated test			2

non-invasive @entity8 test examines foetus dna in cells in mother *'s* blood
results will be given within days - not like the current wait of weeks
@entity101 will be offered at @entity102 in @entity18 , and privately
eventually *similar* tests will be routinely used to reassure pregnant women
