by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:55 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 12:10 est , 19 february 2013 @entity3 's famous ' pardon me ' tv ad is making a comeback for a moment of @entity9 glory			1
after a 16 - year hiatus , the mustard that mocked its own stuffy image in one of tv 's most notable commercials will once again take to the airwaves during the @entity9 ceremony on february 24			1
the spot comes as @entity19 looks to boost sagging sales of the @entity22 mustard , which is facing competition from a growing variety of high - end condiments on supermarket shelves			1
the back window rolls down and a second man asks in an over-the - top snooty accent , ' pardon me , would you have any @entity3 ? ' the first man courteously responds , ' but of course ' and hands him a jar out the window			1
other variations have followed , including one where the mustard - holder delivers the ' but of course ' line before simply driving off , and another where the second aristocrat ca n't reach the jar			1
in the new version , however , the scene continues with the second car speeding off without returning the mustard , sparking a wild car chase through a golf course and city streets			0
@entity67 things club : the commercials appeal to those with a ' higher - end ' image new ads , same old mustard : other versions include one where the man holding the mustard delivers the ' but of course ' line before simply driving off , and another where the second man ca n't reach the jar , above the ad comes complete with explosions to make the spot look like a trailer for an action movie			1
the ad was made by the agency @entity85 , which has also developed ads for @entity87 's , @entity88 and @entity89			2
it was directed by @entity91 , who is known for making more than 40 @entity93 commercials			0
although the original @entity3 ad first aired in 1981 , and others running through 1997 , it 's become so ingrained in pop culture that even teenagers today are familiar with its general spirit , said @entity100 , who heads @entity3 , @entity101 and @entity102 at @entity19			1
parodies of the classic commercial have been seen in @entity105 and the 1992 film @entity107			1
parodies : @entity109 , played by @entity110 , spoofed the classic commercial on an episode of married with children party on : elements of the commercial were also borrowed from the 1992 film @entity107 , when the gang pulled up next to a @entity40 having a laugh : @entity119 delivered the classic line in the film the problem is that the familiarity has n't been doing much for sales			1
over the past four years , the company says @entity3 's sales have been flat to down as more mustards and other condiments have appeared on the shelves			0
its share of the @entity132 mustard market has fallen from 13.7 per cent in 2003 to 11.4 per cent last year , according to market researcher @entity133			0
slipping sales : @entity3 's share of the @entity132 mustard market has fallen from 13.7 per cent in 2003 to 11.4 per cent last year so now @entity19 is hoping to once again put the mustard in the spotlight			0
' @entity3 is not as relevant as it was , ' ms @entity100 said			0
@entity19 plans to air the ad only once on tv , after which it will be available online			2
according to @entity142 , a 30 - second spot during the @entity9 this year is estimated to cost $ 1.7million			1
but @entity19 , based in @entity144 , @entity145 , is hoping the high - profile placement will help spark enough interest to engage people in online marketing campaigns			2
' it 's the classiest award show of the year , so it 's very in line with the brand , ' said ms @entity100 , who noted that the marketing for the @entity22 has always made fun of its own upper - crust image			2
last year , for example , @entity19 began an online campaign with a members - only @entity161 page called ' @entity162			2
' fans had to apply and have their profiles screened to determine whether they met the club 's standards			0
for example , people were given points for liking the opera and @entity171 , or living in @entity172 or @entity173 and attending @entity175 schools			0
points were taken away if people used poor grammar in their posts			0
jokes aside , ms @entity100 said there 's a seed of truth to that higher - end image ; @entity3 customers tend to be skewed toward household incomes of $ 70,000 or more .			0
