by @entity0 and @entity1 for decades they cheerfully offended millions of tv viewers and cinemagoers with their attacks on religion and the establishment			2
but @entity8 have finally succumbed to the censor			1
they gave one of their songs a politically correct makeover for the troupe ’s sold - out reunion shows at @entity18 ’s @entity17			2
@entity19 sings the new , albeit slightly censored version of ' i like @entity22 ' at the @entity17 the stars dropped potentially offensive lines from their 1980 song i like @entity22			1
in the original version of the song , written by @entity19 , he used to sing : ‘ i like @entity22 , i like @entity22 , they only come up to your knees , yet they ’re always friendly , and they ’re ready to please			1
’ but in the version performed at the @entity17 , @entity19 now sings : ‘ i like @entity22 , i like @entity22			2
they copy everything they sees			2
but they ’re up on the boom so they ’ll do as they please			0
’ fellow @entity8 @entity42 said : ‘ @entity19 obviously knows why he changed the lyrics			1
i suppose it was dropped for reasons of political correctness			0
‘ why keep singing “ they only come up to your knees ” ? ’ @entity49 pictured on july 1 performing the classic @entity51 sketch for their new live show at the @entity17 @entity42 said the changes had not been an issue for the rest of the team and added that they had been made ‘ silently ’			1
@entity19 wrote the song for the group ’s @entity60 album			1
he has also dropped the lines ‘ they are cute and they are cuddly and they ’re ready to please ’ and ‘ there ’s 900 million of them in the world today			0
you better learn to like them ; that ’s what i say ’			0
the song is one of the musical highlights of the show and is performed with elaborate sets and backing dancers in oriental costume			1
@entity19 is later joined on stage by his fellow @entity81 who sing the chorus in @entity83			0
new additions to the song include the line : ‘ i like @entity22 , i like @entity22			1
they ’re still a little @entity88 [ sic ] , but @entity89 do n’t need to fret now @entity22 has bought all their debt			0
’ the five remaining members are , from left : @entity93 , @entity19 , @entity42 , @entity49 and @entity94 the ten - night run of shows still contain explicit , bad language and jokes about the @entity99 , including the song @entity100			1
some critics have dismissed the show ’s scantily clad female dancers as sexist and some of the portrayals as homophobic			0
in the past the stars – who provoked uproar with their 1979 film @entity107 – have strongly resisted attempts to censor their work			2
the controversial song has always been something of a guilty pleasure for fans , and one tweeted : ‘ i ’m surprised @entity8 sang i like @entity22 but thankfully the lyrics have been updated ! ’ but comedian @entity116 said he would have preferred the original version			1
‘ i think they should have left it exactly as it was			0
there is far too much @entity123 piety around			0
’ @entity19 was unavailable for comment last night .			0
