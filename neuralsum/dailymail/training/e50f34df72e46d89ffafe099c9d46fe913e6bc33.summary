by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd the completion of @entity2 £ 60million transfer to @entity4 completes the most frightening , and most expensive trio in world football			0
in fact , when added to @entity7 and @entity8 's £ 86m and £ 80m deals , @entity4 can now boast an attacking midfield that costs more than the transfer spend of @entity14 giants @entity13 in their entire 114 - year history			1
the four - time @entity17 winners have spent just £ 183million on transfers - £ 43million less than the @entity4 cash splashed out on the expensively - assembled trio			1
even @entity47 , who added £ 75million @entity49 to the £ 71million purchase of @entity51 this summer , do n't come close - although the disparity is helped by the inclusion of @entity56 product @entity54 , whose transfer fee in today 's market could help @entity47 make up the £ 80million gap			2
and so as @entity2 dons a @entity4 shirt for the first time on tuesday evening , he completes a staggering £ 226million line - up that will leave the money men as opened - mouthed as the defenders who will likely be chasing shadows in @entity67 next season			0
low budget : the lack of funds spent at @entity13 did n't stop @entity72 and @entity73 from lifting trophies famous faces : @entity72 , pictured during his playing days for @entity13 , where he came through the academy difference : @entity78 close : £ 76m @entity49 not cheap : £ 70m @entity51			0

£ 86m @entity7 , £ 80m @entity8 and £ 60m @entity2 make up the expensively - assembled trio behind the *striker*
the famous @entity14 side have spent £ 43m less in their 114 - year history
real own three of the five most expensive players of all - time
@entity47 's most expensive trio of @entity51 ( £ 71m ) , @entity49 ( £ 75m ) and @entity54 do n't come close *due* to the latter 's academy *upbringing*
