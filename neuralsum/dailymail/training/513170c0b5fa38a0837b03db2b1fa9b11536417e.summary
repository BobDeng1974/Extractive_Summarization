by @entity0 having knocked a cyclist off his bike and through a hedge , most drivers would be mortified			1
but not accountancy trainee @entity5			0
the 21 - year - old ’s first thought was to boast about the incident on @entity8			1
writing under the name @ emmaway20 , she tweeted : ‘ @entity12 knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier – i have right of way he does n’t even pay road tax ! # bloodycyclists ’			1
collision : @entity5 ( left ) tweeted she ' definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier '			1
@entity19 ( right ) , 29 , came forward as the cyclist involved in the collision and said he was ' lucky to be alive ' following the crash ironically , she would have heard no more about it had she not chosen to share it with the world because injured cyclist @entity19 had not intended to report it			1
but by rejoicing in her actions , she caused a storm of protest on @entity8 – and brought herself to the attention of the police			1
last night officers confirmed they were investigating @entity33 , while her @entity8 account suddenly fell silent			1
her defence will not be helped by earlier tweets			0
one featured a picture which appeared to be taken from her driving seat , showing a slow - moving car in front			2
the caption read : ‘ this is the reason for my lateness			0
always stuck behind some clueless crazy fool ! # smartcar			0
’ now angry cyclists who claim miss @entity5 is the ‘ clueless crazy fool ’ have forwarded that message to police			2
another tweet on her account passed to officers featured a picture of a speedometer at 95mph – 25mph over the national limit			0
but she must have realised the trouble she was in when she received the following @entity8 message from @entity58 : ‘ we have had tweets ref an @entity61 [ road traffic collision ] with a bike			1
we suggest you report it at a police station asap if not done already & then dm [ direct message ] us			2
’ confession : this tweet by user @entity70 was met with shock and prompted an investigation by @entity75 police mr @entity19 , 29 , a chef from @entity76 , claimed he had ‘ a miraculous escape ’ after being clipped by her car on sunday			1
he was taking part in the 100 - mile @entity82 road riding event when the incident happened five miles from the finish line at @entity85 , near @entity76			1
he said : ‘ a car came tearing round the blind corner and narrowly missed a cyclist in front of me			1
she came on to my side of the road , i took the wing mirror off and i went flying off my bike into a hedge			1
she hit me really hard			0
i am lucky to be alive			2
but i managed to get out of the hedge and stand up			2
‘ the car was nowhere to be seen			2
she hit me , and she was gone			0
all i know is that it was a blonde girl driving			0
‘ i have a sore elbow , a bruised knee , nettle stings from riding through the hedge , but nothing serious			0
’ not angry : mr @entity19 , foreground , said he had not been planning any further action before he was alerted to the @entity8 he said he had not intended to report the accident , fearing that his girlfriend would be worried about him cycling in the future			1
of @entity33 , he said : ‘ i think she came across as a very silly girl and made herself look like a bit of a fool			0
i ’m not angry , i would just like it known that her stupid comment that i do n’t pay road tax is not an excuse to treat cyclists like second - class citizens			1
’ contacted by the mail last night , miss @entity5 refused to comment			0
however a friend said she had been suspended from work at accountants @entity125			0
the friend claimed : ‘ she stopped , but the other guy did n’t stop			0
she looked in the mirror and he was gone			0
there was nobody marshalling the cyclists and they were going really fast			0
‘ she is a village girl who knows every pothole on every road round here			0
she made a stupid remark on @entity8 but it ’s all got out of hand			2
’ a police spokesman said : ‘ further to recent social media postings , we can confirm that we have had initial contact with both parties involved			1

@entity8 user @entity146 bragged about collision with cyclist in @entity76
' i have right of way he does *n't* even pay road tax ! ' the post added
@entity19 , 29 , came forward claiming to be the cyclist involved
said he was knocked into hedge by car and is ' lucky to be alive '
@entity75 police have *launched* an investigation and say they have spoken to both parties involved in the accident
