people who are prone to suffering migraines in middle age are more than twice as likely to develop @entity3 , a new study has found			0
those who suffer early warning signs , known as migraine aura , which include seeing flashing lights , were found to be most at risk , scientists have said			1
the link is thought to be associated with a dysfunction in the brain messenger dopamine , but researchers stressed the risk is still low			1
@entity16 figures show around one in every five women , and one in every 15 men suffer migraines , which usually begin in early adulthood			1
people who suffer migraines in middle age are more than twice as likely to develop @entity3 , a new study by the @entity25 of @entity26 has found yet the exact cause of migraines is unknown			1
they are thought to be the result of temporary changes in the chemicals and blood vessels in the brain			2
around half of all people who experience migraines also have a close relative with the condition , suggesting that genes may play a role			0
dr @entity42 of the @entity25 in @entity26 said : ' migraine is the most common brain disorder in both men and women			1
' it has been linked in other studies to cerebrovascular and heart disease			0
' this new possible association is one more reason research is needed to understand , prevent and treat the condition			0
' a dysfunction in the brain messenger dopamine is common to both @entity3 's and restless legs syndrome ( @entity58 ) , and has been hypothesised as a possible cause of migraine for many years			1
' symptoms of migraine such as excessive yawning , nausea and vomiting are thought to be related to dopamine receptor stimulation			1
' more research should focus on exploring this possible link through genetic studies			0
' while the history of migraine is associated with an increased risk for @entity3 's , that risk is still quite low			2
' the study published online in @entity75 , the medical journal of the @entity77 , examined 5,620 people aged between 33 and 65 over a 25 - year period			0
at the start of the study , 3,924 had no headaches , 1,028 had headaches with no migraine symptoms , 238 had migraine with no aura and 430 had migraine with aura			2
as the study progressed the participants were assessed for any symptoms of @entity3 's , been diagnosed with @entity3 's or had symptoms of @entity58 - also known as @entity58			0
the study , published in @entity75 , found those with migraine aura - where a sufferer experiences early warning signs , like flashing lights - are 3.6 times more likely to suffer @entity3 's , pictured on an mri scan a total of 2.4 per cent of those with migraine with aura had the disease , compared to 1.1 per cent of those with no headaches			1
people with migraine with aura were 3.6 times more likely to report at least four of six symptoms of @entity3 's , while those with migraine with no aura had 2.3 times the odds of these symptoms			2
overall , 19.7 per cent of those with migraine with aura had symptoms , compared to 12.6 per cent of those with migraine with no aura and 7.5 per cent of those with no headaches			2
women with migraine with aura were also more likely to have a family history of parkinson 's disease compared to those with no headaches			1
professor @entity128 , @entity129 , said : ' people who suffer from migraines should not be concerned by this new research			0
' although the results suggest that migraines could double your risk of @entity3 ’s in later life , this risk is still very low			0
' we ’ve known for a while there is a small link between migraine and @entity3 ’s			0
if further research confirms this then migraine could be included as one of a number of early - warning symptoms used to identify people at higher risk of developing @entity3 ’s			1

those who suffer migraine aura - early warning signs - are most at risk
link thought to be associated with dysfunction of dopamine in the brain
one in five women and one in 15 men suffer migraines according to the @entity16
