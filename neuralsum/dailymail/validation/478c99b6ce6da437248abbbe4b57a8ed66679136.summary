what are the chances you will live for another ten years ? while your @entity4 might give you some idea , scientists now say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill			1
the process involves running in three - minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed and at a growing incline			1
scroll down to read @entity16 review of the test ... scientists say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill			1
the process involves running in three - minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed runners then plug in their vital statistics into a basic formula to find out how likely they are to die over the next decade			1
dubbed the @entity30 , the test was created by cardiologists at @entity32 in @entity33 after studying 58,000 stress exams			1
' the notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new , ' said lead investigator @entity38			2
' but we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age , gender and fitness level , and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test			1
' the test consists of three - minute segments that increase in speed and incline			1
follow the below stages in order to see which @entity54 score you reach			1
make sure you record your heart rate during each exercise			1
stage 1 - 1.7 mph / 10 per cent grade / 5 @entity54 stage 2 - 2.5 mph / 12 per cent grade / 7 @entity54 stage 3 - 3.4 mph / 14 per cent grade / 10 @entity54 stage 4 - 4.2 mph / 16 per cent grade / 13 @entity54 stage 5 - 5.0 mph / 18 per cent grade / 15 @entity54 stage 6 - 5.5 mph / 20 per cent grade / 18 @entity54 stage 7 - 5.5 mph / 22 per cent grade / 20 @entity54 then put in your details in to the following formula : ( 12 x @entity54 ) + ( % of maximum predicted heart rate ) – ( 4 x age ) + 43 if female			1
maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 – age			1
heart rate achieved during exercise should be divided by maximum predicted			1
if you have at least zero , your survival rate is 97 percent in the next decade			2
in the study , scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200			2
if you score 100 or higher , you have have a two percent risk of dying over the next 10 years , while those with scores between 0 and 100 face a three per cent death risk over the next decade			0
if you have a score between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 per cent risk of dying in the next 10 years , while scores lower than negative 100 have a 38 per cent risk of dying in a decade			0
as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so - called metabolic equivalents , or @entity54 as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so - called metabolic equivalents , or @entity54			1
this is a gauge of how much energy the body expends during exercise			0
more vigorous activities require higher energy output – or higher @entity54			1
an activity such as slow walking equals two @entity54 , compared with eight for running			1
for the study , the team analysed information on 58,020 people , ages 18 to 96 , from @entity103 , @entity104 , who underwent standard exercise stress tests between 1991 and 2009 for evaluation of chest pain , shortness of breath , fainting or dizziness			2
the researchers then tracked how many of the participants within each fitness level died from any cause over the next decade			0
' get busy living or get busy dying '			0
these were the famous words of advice @entity120 offered to @entity121 during his life sentence in @entity123			0
they were the same words that were going round my head as i stepped up to the ' when am i going to die challenge '			0
i 'm a 33 - year - old man of average height and build with an emerging paunch			2
i spent my twenties drinking and smoking but thanks to a second go at hypnosis , i knocked the smokes on the head last year			0
i consider myself fairly healthy having passed my formative years swimming , cycling and playing football			0
now , when i can be bothered , i go to @entity141 yoga and run			0
i looked at the test and thought : easy , before hauling myself off to the @entity147 's @entity146 on 14th			2
i fired up the treadmill and got going			2
stage 1 - 1.7 mph / 10 per cent grade / 5 @entity54 easy			1
i walk twice as fast			0
stage 2 - 2.5 mph / 12 per cent grade / 7 @entity54 still easy but it reminded me why hate treadmills			1
they make walking and running so boring			2
should have brought my headphones			0
stage 3 - 3.4 mph / 14 per cent grade / 10 @entity54 @entity156 jump is considerate and i 'm starting to feel it			1
what is wrong with me ? the @entity158 is on my tail			0
stage 4 - 4.2 mph / 16 per cent grade / 13 @entity54 it was all that food and booze at @entity163			1
i should have done dry january			0
must stop going to @entity166 's pizza			0
i 'm not going to finish this i know it			0
stage 5 5.0 mph / 18 per cent grade / 15 @entity54 no can do			1
treadmill does n't go up as far as 20 per cent and thank @entity171			2
no way i can do last two stages			0
it was the incline that got me			2
much harder than i thought			0
if the test is accurate i 've got two per cent chance of dying in the next ten years			2
not as bad as i thought			0
unlike @entity120 from @entity123 , i have n't got to start digging just yet			0
@entity179 for @entity16 the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by @entity54 , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk			1
fitness level was the single most powerful predictor of death and survival , even after researchers accounted for other important variables such as diabetes and family history of premature death			0
scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200 , with those above 0 having lower mortality risk and those in the negative range facing highest risk of dying			0
patients who scored 100 or higher had a 2 per cent risk of dying over the next 10 years , while those with scores between 0 and 100 faced a 3 per cent death risk over the next decade			0
people with scores between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 percent risk of dying in the next 10 years , while those with scores lower than negative 100 had a 38 per cent risk of dying			0
' the @entity30 is easy to calculate and costs nothing beyond the cost of the treadmill test itself , ' says senior study author @entity215			1
the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by @entity54 , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk exercise stress tests usually measure how well the heart and lungs respond to physical exertion while a person is walking on a treadmill at progressively higher speed and elevation			1
the test is stopped once a person reaches the point of exhaustion or develops chest pain , dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities			1
those who have normal readings and no alarming symptoms while exercising are said to have ' normal ' results and typically do not require further testing			0
however , the researchers say , the new data show varying degrees of fitness among those with ' normal ' stress test results that reveal telling clues about cardiac and respiratory fitness and , therefore , overall death risk over time			2
' stress test results are currently interpreted as ' either / or ' but we know that heart disease is a spectrum disorder , ' dr @entity38 says			1
' we believe that our @entity30 score reflects the complex nature of cardiovascular health and can offer important insights to both clinicians and patients			0

test involves running in three - minute segments on a treadmill
the speed needs to gradually increase along with growing incline
runners can then plug in their vital statistics into a basic formula
as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate
it also looks at ability to tolerate exertion as measured by ' @entity54 '
scientists say the test is more useful than existing stress exams
