' there never was a case against @entity12 , ' @entity27 said			0
' this was a made up pile of lies from the beginning and it took the jury approximately 10 hours to find that out			0
' during his testimony last week , @entity12 frequently broke down and had to take breaks when he recounted his ill treatment of his late wife throughout their marriage			2
