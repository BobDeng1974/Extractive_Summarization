@entity0 tried her hand at table tennis while @entity3 joined the basketball court and @entity5 took to the football pitch by @entity7 , royal correspondent her husband and his brother are the sportsmen of the family			1
but yesterday the @entity0 beat them both hands down			1
while prince @entity5 ’s shot at goal on the football pitch was wildly inaccurate and prince @entity3 missed all four basketball hoops he attempted , @entity0 picked up a table tennis bat and showed the menfolk exactly how it was done			1
she was described as ‘ unbelievably talented ’ by a coach – despite playing in heels – while trying her hand at the sport as the three young royals attended the launch of a project in @entity26 that aims to train the next generation of sports coaches			1
prince @entity3 missed his four shots at goal in the basketball but @entity0 looked calm and she played table tennis			1
@entity0 looked the picture of summer perfect in a patterned white and beige @entity63 summer dress , low beige wedges and with her trademark blowdry			1
@entity0 's ' @entity68 ' dress cost £ 35 in the sale from @entity71 store @entity63 but is sold out			1
later on she changed into more appropriate wear – a white polo shirt and slender blue trousers – to join @entity5 and @entity3 again to welcome the @entity76 flame at @entity77			1
the @entity78 was joined by @entity79 , chief executive of @entity80 , and chatted to some of the coaches who were taking the lessons			0
but @entity5 could not resist joining in and lined up with a group of youngsters for shooting practice			2
the royal shimmied through some cones then passed the ball to a trainer who returned it for the shot , but @entity5 hit it just wide of an empty goal			2
with his head bowed he trudged back to the middle of the pitch but a few minutes later had the chance to redeem himself when the students were asked to volley the ball into the net			0
as @entity5 ran forward the trainer threw the ball into the air and shouted ' keep your eyes on it ' but the royal sent it just over the bar but received the encouraging comment ' much better ' from the coach			2
in a short speech about coach core @entity5 jokingly likened himself to being a ' giraffe on ice skates ' on the football pitch and ribbed his brother @entity3 about ' cheating ' to become the fastest man on earth - a reference to his legendary race against @entity120 in @entity121 earlier this year '			1
but he charmingly described his wife , @entity122 , as being ' a sight to behold with a tennis or hockey stick in her hand '			2
the coach @entity37 programme is being piloted by the organisation @entity80 and will train 16 to 19 - year - olds to become qualified coaches and mentors for their schools and communities			0
the hope is that the talented young sportsmen and women will be able to inspire their students and build a future for themselves in sport			0
forget your kit , @entity0 ? she may not have the right attire , but a very game @entity0 attempts to dribble a football wearing her @entity144 wedged espadrilles if it proves successful , the foundation aims to roll out the initiative to other sectors where inspirational young coaches can become role models for and inspire young people			1
' the @entity156 of @entity78 and @entity0 and prince @entity3 wanted to develop a sports programme in recognition of @entity26 hosting the @entity76 and developed the coach @entity37 concept with greenhouse charity , ' a spokesman for the three said			1
@entity5 made a speech and thanked @entity162 , the @entity163 , the staff and pupils of @entity35 for hosting the event and giving himself , @entity0 and @entity3 such a warm welcome			1
' over the next month , the eyes of the world will be on @entity170			0
for us to hold the @entity76 and the @entity172 here in @entity26 is a great moment for our @entity175 , which itself is steeped in sporting history			0
' therefore , for @entity122 , @entity3 and me there could be no better way of starting this epic time than being with you here in @entity183 , so close to the heart of @entity185 , to launch coach @entity37 , ' he said			2
the young @entity186 told of how important coaching is within the sports field			0
he said : ' coaching is a vital part of any sport			0
being properly coached , really knowing about your sport – how to play it , how to train for it , how to compete - allows you to enjoy it to the full and gain most value from it			0
being properly coached is also the key to success , over the next few weeks we just need to look over the river to see the power of coaching			0
‬ ‪ ‬ @entity32 of @entity33 tried her hand at judging a judo match - but stopped short of actually joining in with the contact sport ' coach @entity37 will offer 16 to 22 year olds the opportunity to become first class coaches , taught and mentored by professionals in their field and in turn passing these skills on to other young people			2
once this year ’s pilot scheme is successfully completed , we hope over the next few years to train hundreds , then thousands , of young people to become coaches - and in time , transform the sporting potential , aspiration and enjoyment of many thousands more across this @entity223			0
‬ ‪ ' a special thank you to all those here today who have already signed up for the project			0
@entity122 , @entity3 and i wish you every success in your new careers as sports coaches			2
‬ ‪ ' @entity5 and his brother were dressed equally casually - well , for male royals - in open neck shirts and chinos			2
@entity3 sported a distinctive patterned @entity237 belt and brown suede shoes			2
he walked onto the five - a - side football pitch where dozens of school children were practising shooting , dribbling and passing skills , and made two attempts on goal after running through a series of plastic cones			1
he put the first shot 6ft wide and the second over the top of the bar			0
he later joked with one girl : ' obviously it was the shoes			0
' @entity5 and @entity3 asked a group of about a dozen boys and girls which team they supported			1
many answered @entity259 or @entity260			0
one boy told @entity5 he supported the duke 's favourite team , @entity262 , to which @entity5 replied : ' good man , good man			2
' another boy said @entity266 , the @entity267 and @entity268 midfielder , was the best in the world			0
@entity5 said : ' he is good , is n't he			0
' the @entity78 and @entity0 prepare to join in a football games , in which @entity5 attempts to score - but blames his shoes when he misses			1
right , sharing a joke with @entity3 we 're game ! @entity5 and @entity0 discuss tactics ahead of their appearance on the pitch @entity32 of @entity33 chatted with the children undergoing sports training at the @entity183 college , and @entity283 cheered on the games @entity5 , @entity0 and @entity3 chatted to the young athletes before he made a speech emphasising how important sports coaching is @entity5 took to the football pitch , while @entity0 showed her hand at table tennis and @entity3 played basketball basket case : prince @entity3 tried his hand at basketball during the visit @entity0 looked the picture of summer style in a patterned white and beige @entity63 dress , low beige @entity302 wedges and with her trademark blowdry the @entity78 and @entity0 and prince @entity3 arrive at @entity35 in @entity305 for the launch of a new sports project in a short speech about coach core @entity5 jokingly likened himself to being a ' giraffe on ice skates ' on the football pitch @entity32 of @entity33 arrived by car with @entity5 at @entity313 @entity0 wore a @entity63 dress and her favourite wedges whilst @entity5 went for a simple , yet smart look in a white shirt and black trousers sport physique : @entity0 with @entity5 as they greet the arrival of the @entity76 torch at @entity77 meanwhile , at a press conference in @entity325 , @entity323 deflected questions about her royal connections , saying they had nothing to do with her @entity76 pass forget the forecast , we @entity47 only truly know it ’s summer when the @entity0 swaps her trusty @entity335 for a pair of @entity302 wedges - and today she appeared in her summer favourites - the purse - friendly @entity339 ( £ 80 )			1
a dressed - down @entity0 , @entity5 and @entity3 appeared at @entity35 in @entity26 today to launch an initiative to help young sportspeople become coaches			1
clad in a customised grey @entity63 ' @entity68 ' dress ( you can pick one up for £ 35 in the sale at @entity347 ) , @entity0 looked every inch the frugalista			0
until , that is , you reach her immaculately glossy and luxuriously expensive - looking blowdry which stayed perfectly in place and completely frizz - free as she played a quick game of table tennis and refereed a judo match			1
