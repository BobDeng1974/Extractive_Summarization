it is still early in the season but already serious questions are being asked of @entity3			1
the biggest one , i feel , is this : what is changing ? watching them crumble against @entity10 on tuesday night , it was impossible to escape the conclusion that they are n’t learning			1
for a decade now , @entity3 have been unable to contain opponents who go with a fast , physical gameplan			2
everyone knows how to play against them			0
@entity3 were defeated 2 - 0 in @entity10 on tuesday , but it could have been much more for the @entity17 @entity18 has been brought in from @entity19 , but is yet to score after a host of chances @entity10 could have comfortably run up a score similar to the ones posted by @entity24 ( 5 - 1 in february ) and @entity25 ( 6 - 0 in march ) , but the aspect i found most alarming was the fact they have only kept three clean sheets in their past 29 @entity31 away games			1
that , frankly , is an awful record			0
when i watch @entity3 now , i get frustrated			2
they play the same way wherever they go — with their full - backs pushed up high and wide — and get caught on the counter-attack			1
they are the away team ! they should be doing that to the home team when they go travelling			0
why do n’t they learn ? it is unforgivable that this keeps happening			0
the penny needs to drop			0
when i played in @entity51 with @entity24 , the first objective was always to get a clean sheet : make yourself difficult to break down then , if a chance arose , pounce and pick up whatever you could			2
if the home fans did n’t like it , so what ? yet @entity3 feel they can beat anyone			1
the only team able to get away with such a philosophy in recent years was @entity66 ’s @entity65 — one of the greatest sides of all time — but even he was n’t afraid to concoct different tactical plans			0
look at how last year ’s champions , @entity71 , secured their place in the final by playing on the counter-attack against @entity75 — and that was in the first leg at the @entity77			2
it was the best tactic for them to use			0
doing things differently is vital			0
@entity81 , for one , always has a surprise up his sleeve			0
sir @entity84 , remember , sometimes used @entity85 - sung in man - marking roles in @entity51 and would have @entity88 up front on his own , as he knew he would not track the opposition full - back			0
with @entity3 , though , it seems there is one way only and you ca n’t help but wonder where it is all heading			2
@entity95 is a legendary figure in our game ; his achievements will stand the test of time but you sometimes question whether there is a negative to him being so secure in his job			1
@entity95 must go back to the drawing board if he is to take @entity3 to the next level @entity3 stars @entity109 ( left ) and @entity110 ( right ) look dejected on tuesday night last season , @entity25 finished three points ahead of @entity3 in third place			1
but @entity95 had the better campaign , as he finished it with the @entity115			1
@entity81 knows there is going to be scrutiny on him and his position this season if he does not succeed , so he has strengthened his squad impressively			0
in came proven winners — headed by @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 — and the results , bar an unexpected stutter against @entity127 in midweek , are there for all to see			2
@entity25 are favourites to lift the @entity129 after four straight victories			2
@entity95 , by contrast , buys players with the future in mind			2
both are fine prospects , but there is n’t the same scrutiny on @entity95 from the boardroom as there is with @entity81			2
it ’s like he ’s always looking to tomorrow , not addressing today			0
why was n’t wenger in the market for @entity122 when everyone knew @entity3 needed a proven striker ? why not try to sign @entity146 , the best goalkeeper in the @entity129 last year ? yes , @entity109 has quality but was he really what @entity3 required ? @entity25 , who finished just ahead of @entity3 , went out and signed @entity122 from @entity150 why did n't @entity95 try to sign @entity25 's @entity146 , or rival them for defender @entity151 ? i ’ve said before that @entity3 ’s spine is not strong enough			1
with questions hanging over @entity156 and @entity157 , they needed a left back , so why did n’t they rival @entity25 for @entity151 ? go back 10 years and @entity3 had a template for winning the title			1
i can only stress , again , that between 2002 and 2004 , they were the best team i ever faced			0
they had pace and power , skill and top ability from goalkeeper to centre forward			0
i understand that it ’s difficult to keep finding players such as @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 but there were others — @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 — who were not the biggest names but all had class and all could handle the physical demands of the @entity184 football			0
now when you look at @entity3 , you see very few who look capable of enduring the rigours of a @entity129 campaign			2
@entity3 look weak and they are screaming out for someone with presence to help hold their midfield together			2
@entity18 ( left ) and @entity135 are prospects , but @entity3 are always looking to tomorrow and not today they do , of course , remain capable of playing fine football but memories of the days when they did it in the biggest games are fading			1
they are entering a period now that could prove crucial in defining the shape of their season			0
after saturday 's meeting with @entity209 , they have the small matter of the north @entity212 derby , then a trip to @entity214 ; there is also a @entity31 tussle with @entity217			2
the biggest concern is their performance in the big contests			0
even when they went 2 - 1 up against @entity224 last saturday , i never felt @entity3 would win			1
they should have lost the game in the end and you always expect them to concede in the pressure moments			0
if that does n’t change , nothing in the bigger picture will change , either			0
they wo n’t challenge for the biggest prizes and they will continue to be picked off in the crucial fixtures			0
it is up to @entity95 to find the answers			0
of course , replacing the likes of @entity171 and @entity172 was always going to be a tough task @entity242 stars @entity244 eye route to the elite if results were mixed for @entity184 sides in the @entity31 , it was good to see @entity244 strike a blow with their thumping 4 - 1 win against @entity251			1
@entity252 selected his strongest team and was rewarded with an excellent result and performance against quality opposition			0
it was good to see him take that approach , particularly when some @entity129 teams in the past have played as if they do n’t want to be in @entity51			0
@entity261 celebrates with @entity262 after the defender scored a penalty in the 48th minute the question now facing @entity244 , though , is how do they cope with the rhythm of playing thursday - sunday football ? can they keep producing results in the @entity129 after they have been in @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity17 ? should they be able to do that , they will be in for another successful season and it might just be that the @entity278 offers @entity252 the best opportunity to fulfil the ambition that he promised @entity281 when he arrived in june 2013			1
@entity282 looked a picture under the floodlights on thursday evening against @entity251 @entity252 said he would ‘ get @entity244 into the @entity31 ’ and the @entity278 gives him a chance to get there			1
@entity244 got 72 points in the @entity129 last season yet still could n’t finish in the top four and competition for those places will only be harder again this time around			1
@entity244 , however , have shown they are going to take the @entity278 seriously and that might open up a bigger avenue to them further down the line			1
this week i ’m looking forward to ... watching @entity122 and @entity296 go to war			1
if @entity224 ’s clash with @entity25 is the game of the season so far , the subplot of sunday 's clash between @entity296 and @entity122 is fascinating			1
i watched @entity303 last week against @entity3 and he was outstanding			0
he is the number one defender in the @entity129 and playing at the top of his game , but the challenge he will face from @entity122 is going to be different than anything he has had this season			1
@entity296 puts his body on the line against @entity75 in an attempt to stop @entity315 similar sentiments apply to @entity122			1
he was deservedly @entity317 for august and seven goals in his first four matches make him the most feared striker in the division , but he has not tackled a defender of @entity296 ’s calibre			0
i have been in @entity296 ’s position before and when you know you are going to face one of the best attackers in the game , it is only natural that you spend time thinking about your private battle , not just the outcome of the game in general			1
the way it looks at the moment , @entity224 and @entity25 are going to be the teams slugging it out for the title and even at this early stage , getting an advantage could be significant			1
much will depend on who emerges on top between @entity296 and @entity122			1
one thing is for sure and that is that it will be compelling viewing			0
@entity122 scored a hat - trick against @entity345 and has seven in four league matches this season			1

@entity3 crumbled against @entity10 on tuesday night
the @entity17 could have matched the heavy defeats @entity3 received from @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity224 last season
@entity95 's side play the same way wherever they go , and get caught
they feel they can beat anyone , anywhere , playing their own game
@entity25 finished three points ahead of @entity3 last term , but bought well
why did n't @entity95 go for @entity146 , @entity122 or @entity151 ?
it was good to see @entity244 strike a blow with their 4 - 1 win over @entity251
this year 's @entity278 winner goes into the @entity31
@entity296 vs @entity122 will be an epic battle at the @entity372
