parents have attacked a ' disgusting ' new television advert for a life insurance company - which appears to show a monster urinating on a customer in a bath			1
the bizarre tv campaign for beagle street life insurance was given a restriction preventing it from being shown around children 's programmes			1
it was , however , broadcast numerous times during the day and in the early evening leading to more than 50 complaints made to the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
the advert was shown on a number of channels , including during a showing of movie about a boy on @entity21 and @entity22 on @entity23 as well as on @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity26			1
the advert starts with a man reading a newspaper as he takes a relaxing soak in the tub			2
but two seconds in , a monster appears and turns on a tap between his legs before spraying a jet of water at the shocked man 's face			0
' a few seconds later , the monster suddenly explodes - sending fluff all over the man - before turning into a cute @entity62 - like character			2
the voiceover then comes back in , adding : ' but @entity64 is different			1
a simple , friendly life insurance service online			0
' the new smaller creature then says ' @entity67 , little back rub ? ' before the 30 - second advert ends with the company website			1
@entity64 say it is aimed at engaging with a new generation of customers who do n't have or understand life insurance			2
the campaign , launched by advertising company @entity76 , who describe it as ' a cheeky dig at the old way of life insurance '			0
but furious parents blasted the company and said the ' disturbing ' advert - called ' life insurance			2
reborn ' - had given their young children nightmares			2
one said : ' i do n't have problems with ads but this one is really freaking out my four - year - old nephew who has stopped the family from turning the tv on			1
' he does n't even have a bath because he 's too frightened of the gremlin jumping out in the bath			0
' he is screaming and wo n't go up to bed in time , he takes his mum up to bed at 8pm with her and wo n't let anyone switch television on at all			0
' the campaign aims to engage with a new generation of customers who do n't have or understand life insurance in a strange turn of events , the monster disappears leaving feathers and a @entity62 - like creature in its place another parent added : ' this advert is not suitable for daytime viewing			1
my two - year - old son cries as soon as it starts now and we have to act quickly to turn the channel over			1
' whoever came up with this advertising campaign clearly does not have children and in my view has completely driven away families from ever using their services			0
' it should not be shown in the daytime or even at all as it 's a ridiculous advert for the product it is attempting to promote			2
' one disgusted view said : ' it is a horrible advert , totally repellent , and i do not understand why anyone would be compelled to buy life insurance from this company			0
' also , although i do see that the monster in the corner is squirting water from the tap at the man in the bath , it looks like he is weeing on him			0
' this one ought to be banned - or limited to @entity146			0
' another parent fumed : ' my two - year - old experienced terrible nightmares after seeing this advert			1
' kids do not need to see this kind of advertising and to be honest , most adults do n't need to either			0
' viewers also took to social media to express their disgust			0
@entity159 wrote on @entity160 : ' it 's 8.10pm and that stupid # @entity162 advert has come on			0
surely it 's a tad scary for kids ? ( @entity165 is in bed ! ) ' @entity167 added : ' what is with that beagle street ad ? ? ? its gross and disturbing , makes me feel sick @entity173 ' and @entity174 said : ' @entity175 witnessed the sketchiest life insurance ad ever ... scarred ! # beaglestreet ' the @entity14 received 55 complaints and others took to @entity160 to express their disgust defending the campaign , @entity179 , founding partner of @entity76 , said : ' there are so many barriers to life insurance at the moment , hence the need for a simplification			1
' we believe the campaign is altogether very un-life insurance in a good way			0
' on their website , the advertising company say : ' our launch campaign takes a cheeky dig at the old way of life insurance and introduces the cutest of characters that is the embodiment of @entity64 ... life insurance reborn			2
' the @entity200 ( @entity14 ) confirmed they had received 55 complaints about the advert			1
they also revealed the campaign had been given an ex-kids restriction by @entity206 - meaning it should n't be broadcast around programmes that appeal to children			1
a spokesperson for the @entity14 said they were looking into the complaints to see if the advert should be investigated			1
they added : ' generally complaints about the ad have said it is offensive and inappropriate for children			0
' this ad has been shown at a variety of times during the day and early evening			1
' the ad was given an ex-kids restriction by @entity206			0
an ex-kids restriction means that it should not be broadcast in or around programmes with particular appeal to children			2
' this means it could appear at any time of the day , but should n't appear during ad breaks for kids programmes			1
' we are currently investigating these complaints to see if the ad should be investigated			0

@entity14 got 55 complaints about @entity64 advert
it was given a restriction to not be shown during kids programmes
but was shown during the day and early evening on @entity21 and @entity23
one parent said : ' my two - year - old experienced terrible nightmares '
