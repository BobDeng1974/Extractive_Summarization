by @entity0 legal battle : dr @entity2 claimed he was fired by the government because his research offered a solution to end global warming			1
the @entity7 settled out of court a scientist working on a new power source has agreed an out - of - court settlement with @entity13 's atomic agency after claiming they sacked him because his research could halt global warming			1
dr @entity2 believes small fusion machines , known as tokamaks , could be the answer to providing clean and plentiful electricity			1
but he sued the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) after claiming bosses suppressed his work , bullied him and then sacked him in a bid to discredit him and his work			2
the agency , who said he was making ' unsupported ' claims about his work for financial reasons , settled with him today			0
the @entity29 - born physicist had worked for the @entity7 for more than 22 years when he was sacked from his job working at their research facilities near @entity33 , @entity34 last year			2
' i have an exemplary record as an outstanding fusion scientist and innovator , ' he told the tribunal			0
' i have tried to do my duty to the @entity41 , giving all my experience and capability to promote the faster way to fusion energy			2
' i was invited to come to the @entity41 to do this research which has been hugely successful by any measure and which led directly to the flagship of the @entity41 's own fusion research programme			1
now i have been fired for pursuing this research			2
' he said in late 2012 the chief executive of @entity7 , professor @entity53 , was ' rude and intimidating ' towards him at a meeting and accused him of ' wrongdoing '			0
he said : ' even worse , it appears that a professor @entity53 was attempting to stop my work because it might reveal the inconvenient truth that research on small tokamaks can help to accelerate the development of the fusion energy as a promising solution to global warming and possible shortage of energy			1
' ' fusion energy is likely to bring major global environmental benefits			0
' hence suppressing a promising area of fusion research and deliberately ignoring its potential advantages is likely to cause damage to the environment in future			2
' problems arose around three years after dr @entity2 co-founded @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , a commercial venture making small tokamaks with a view to generating electricity in years to come			1
he said a prior arrangement to allow him to take unpaid leave to attend conferences outside his role for the @entity7 , a situation apparently supported by @entity87 , suddenly changed in late 2012 when he was told there was a conflict of interest			2
' i still do n't understand what possible potential there is for conflict and i do n't know what damage i could have caused to the respondent , ' he said			0
' i have quite reasonably asked for this information but it has not been given to me			0
' he was sacked in march last year and told the tribunal he had tried to encourage @entity41 universities to become involved in tokamak research but that professor @entity53 had tried to thwart his efforts and told the universities that the machines did not help fusion research			1
long serving : dr @entity2 worked for the @entity7 for 22 years , here at its research facility at @entity112 , @entity34 at the start of the tribunal hearing in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , counsel for @entity7 , challenged the claimant			1
she said there were doubts over dr @entity2 's scientific theory but that the @entity7 had allowed him to conduct his work			1
miss @entity117 argued that in his bid to attract venture capitalists to fund the work , dr @entity2 had made claims about being able to generate electricity ' within ten years '			1
' he made the claims for financial gain			0
he did n't really believe them , ' she told the tribunal panel			0
the tribunal was sensationally halted this afternoon after dr @entity2 and the @entity7 reached an out - of - court settlement over his unfair dismissal claim			1
the agreement means his claim was withdrawn and the case dismissed			0
dr @entity2 , 59 , from @entity112 , @entity34 , who brought a scale model of the tokamak technology to the tribunal , said : ' it was never about money from the very beginning			1
we want to succeed with fusion energy			0
' we hope in the future that we will be able to work with the @entity7			0
we have experiments continuing at @entity150 tomorrow			0
' dr @entity151 , chief executive of @entity152 , who represented his colleague at the tribunal , added : ' we are great enthusiasts for fusion and we have made a decision to get back to doing that			2
' there are great facilities at @entity112 which we want to work with as and when we can			0

dr @entity2 sued the @entity7 after sacking
argued it was because his fusion research found ' solution to global warming '
' i was invited to come to the @entity41 to do this research , which led to the the @entity41 's own fusion programme . now i *'ve* been fired for pursuing this research '
employment tribunal ended suddenly today after *parties* agreed settlement
