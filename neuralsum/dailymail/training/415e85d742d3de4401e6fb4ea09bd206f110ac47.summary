@entity200 , @entity201 , where as much as 10 and a half inches fell on tuesday surprise ! @entity204 the pooch is about to get a cold introduction to winter from owner @entity207 , who shoveled off her porch in @entity200 tuesday fun in the snow : like any good western @entity18 residents , @entity211 ( left ) and @entity210 wide receiver @entity213 ( right ) enjoyed their snow day buried in @entity26 : residents were urged to stay home and keep off the streets in the midst of the deluge sledders , from left , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 trek across the snow - covered @entity226 in @entity228 , @entity229 in search of the perfect hill on monday morning cold - lanta : even residents of normally - balmy @entity234 had to bundle up against the cold as temperatures dipped into the 20s high winds mixed with the heavy snowfall to cause - near whiteout conditions in much of @entity26 three feet : this @entity26 resident measured 34 inches of snow on tuesday morning - and two more feet could fall before it stops silver lining ? the cold weather is great news for those in the ski industry - pictured are snow cannons getting to work on @entity248 in @entity249 , @entity250 even cold down south : two students in @entity253 , @entity254 , bundled up on their way to school after temperatures hit 27 degrees			1
a low of 24 is expected tonight surf 's not up : even on the sands of @entity262 , @entity9 , the chilly weather kept all but a hardy few out of the sea thunder and lightning are more usually associated with warmer climates but under certain conditions they can occur in cold ones too			0
@entity269 starts out like a summer thunderstorm - the sun heats the ground and pushes masses of warm , moist air upward , creating unstable air columns			0
as it rises , the moisture condenses to form clouds , which are jostled by internal turbulence			0
@entity279 is caused by this rubbing of the clouds against each other - thunder is the sound of lightning but as sound moves more slowly than light we hear it later			0
the tricky part for making thundersnow is creating that atmospheric instability in the wintertime			0
when it is cold , and particularly in air conducive to snowfall , the lower atmosphere is dry , cold and very stable			0
for thundersnow to occur there needs to be a very precise set of circumstances - the air layer closer to the ground has to be warmer than the layers above , but still cold enough to create snow			0
when this happens warm air rises , snow falls and thunder , lightning and snow all occur at the same time .			0
