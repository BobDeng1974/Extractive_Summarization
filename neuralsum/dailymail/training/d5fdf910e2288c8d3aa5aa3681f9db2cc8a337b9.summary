by @entity0 published : 08:01 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 08:02 est , 27 may 2013 a solar kettle that harnesses energy from the @entity4 and does not require access to mains electricity has gone on sale			1
the kettle , developed by @entity10 engineer @entity9 , boils water by using solar technology , making it ideal for intrepid explorers who need more than a traditional flask to keep them warm and hydrated			1
in addition to making a cup of tea , the portable kettle can also be used to sterilise river water and desalinate seawater			1
the @entity22 , designed by @entity10 engineer @entity9 , harnesses the @entity4 's rays to make a cup of tea possible no matter where you are in the world			1
it can also be used as a flask to store hot water for long periods resembling a telescope , it works by using a thermal vacuum tube to absorb and convert the @entity4 ’s rays into heat			1
two exterior reflectors open out to maximise the amount of solar energy obtained , enabling the water inside to boil without the need for any additional energy supply			2
it also comes with an built - in stand so that it can be positioned to face the @entity4 , along with a thermometer located on the lid , which allows the user to monitor the temperature of the water			2
the @entity22 ’s exterior remains cool to touch , even when the contents are at the boiling point , reducing the risk of burns to the user			0
it can also be used to store hot water for long periods of time			2
the kettle is weighs 1.2 kg ( 2.6 lb ) when empty and only stores half a litre of water at a time			0
but it could be the difference between life and death as it can sterilise river water and desalinate seawater			1
the inventor also says it can boil an egg the kettle uses a thermal vacuum tube to absorb and convert the sun ’s rays into heat			1

the @entity22 ’s exterior remains cool to touch , even when the contents are at the boiling point , reducing the risk of burns to the user			0
but weighing in at 1.2 kg ( 2.6 lb ) when empty , it is considerably heavier than most flasks			0
it can only hold around half a litre of water and takes approximately two hours to boil from cold			0
but in survival situations the kettle , which costs £ 35 from @entity101 , can be used to sterilise contaminated water and purify it for drinking			2
it can also desalinate seawater to make it safe to drink			1
and because the @entity22 contains a vacuum between its layers , it remains cool to the touch			0
the vacuum should last around 25 years			0
mr @entity9 , from @entity112 , @entity113 , explained that the kettle can be used to boil water for making hot drinks , cooking an egg , and sterilising medical equipment			1
he said : ' whether you 're a cyclist , canoeist , climber , ambler , angler , hiker or bird watcher , the @entity22 's ability to boil water using sunlight in remote areas brings many benefits			2
' you can make a cuppa , have a shave , do the washing up , improve water and medical equipment sanitation and cook lunch			0
' it 's incredibly versatile			0
no electricity , no gas , no fuss			0

@entity10 engineer @entity9 has harnessed the @entity4 's rays to make a cup of tea possible wherever you are in the world
kettle holds *500ml* and can be used to make hot drinks and boil and egg
could also make the difference between life and death because it can purify river water and desalinate seawater to make both drinkable
