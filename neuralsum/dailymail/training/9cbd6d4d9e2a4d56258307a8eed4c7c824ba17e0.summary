@entity5 , who was under contract with @entity1 for a further season , surprisingly stepped down on tuesday just one day into the @entity1 's pre-season preparations			2
the @entity32 midfielder revealed he left @entity3 because @entity2 did not consider him part of his first - team plans			1
' the real reason why i left @entity3 was because @entity2 wanted to use @entity37 or @entity38 in front of the defence instead of me			1
' that meant that i had to change position on the pitch			0
so i said ‘ no thanks ’ to @entity3 and chose @entity1			0
