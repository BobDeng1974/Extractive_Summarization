a study found that ‘ helicopter mothers ’ who hover over and control their children ’s lives are resented			1
and the bossier they are , the more the discontent builds			0
resentment : ' helicopter mothers ' who hover over and control their children 's lives can expect little thanks in the future , a study suggests researcher professor @entity21 , from the @entity22 , said : ' children flourish when they have opportunities to make choices about what they do , particularly in play situations			1
' the @entity22 team studied videos of children playing with their mothers			1
' mothers who are highly directive do not allow that kind of choice			2
in our study , the children were playing with some toys , and the very directive mothers were making the decisions about how to play , what to play and how quickly to play , ' the professor said			2
' children flourish when they have opportunities to make choices about what they do ' professor @entity21 , @entity22 more than 2,000 children were taped when they were aged one , two and three and again before they started school			0
the pushy mothers tended to correct their children , rather than simply allowing them to have fun			1
for instance , when a child tried to put a plastic cow into a toy barn through the window , the mother would show them how to put it through the door instead			0
@entity62 : mothers who constantly correct young children may be stifling their creativity and if a child was playing with a pretend kitchen set , the controlling mother might not let the child touch the fake burners on the stove			1
professor @entity21 , an expert in human development , said that while mothers might think they are helping the their children by correcting them , they may instead be stifling their creativity			1
their interference may also mean their children find spending time with them less enjoyable			0
however , warm and caring parenting cancels out some of the negative effects of bossiness , according to the report published in the journal @entity86 : @entity87			0
professor @entity21 said : ' even if mothers were very directive , if they were also warm , the negative effects of high directiveness lessened			0
' we know that children , regardless of culture , need to feel loved			0
' children take in the meaning of what their mothers are trying to do , so if a mum is being very directive and is generally a very warm person , i think the child feels , " my mum is doing this because she cares about me , and she 's trying to do the best for me			1
" ' if that warmth is missing , then the child might feel , " my mum is trying to control me , and i do n't like it			0
" ' she added that as the children got older , the mothers tended to become less bossy , perhaps because they trusted them more			2
@entity112 head teachers have warned of the peril of ' helicopter parents ' , saying that ambitious mothers and fathers are condemning middle - class children to years of stress and anxiety			2
and some parents are still hovering over their children when they leave school			0
universities have complained about parents joining their sons and daughters for freshers ' week , with some even sleeping in their children 's dorms .			1
