fat fighter : @entity7 says she was able to munch through 15 bags of crisps in an evening things took a turn for the worse when , in her 20s , she was a size 14 and her boyfriend at the time told her he always dated slimmer girls who were a size eight			1
@entity7 said : ' my confidence was non-existent			1
i knew i should have been a size ten but i was living a party lifestyle , going out drinking and having curries at 1am			2

after going back and forth to doctors ' appointments for five years , she was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid			2
it was at the doctors that she finally weighed herself and realised the scales were reading 15st			2
it served as a wake - up call and she prepared herself for the fight of life			2
@entity7 said : ' i was gobsmacked			1
i had accepted that i was about 13 stone but to see 15 was a complete shock			0

' the doctor told me that if i did n't lose weight i was at risk of developing diabetes - it was a real wake - up call			2
