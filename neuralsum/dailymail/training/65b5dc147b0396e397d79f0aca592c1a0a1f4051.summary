@entity0 , the virtual reality firm recently bought by @entity2 for $ 2bn , is expected to release a consumer version next - and one designer has revealed a stunning concept of how it could look			1
the rift concept has a flexible screen , gesture sensors and headphones built in to transport the wearer to a virtual world			1
its designer claims the gadget could for for virtual reality what the @entity15 did for mobile phones			2
the firm 's co-founder claims it could cost as little as $ 200			2
spot the difference : the current prototype of the @entity0 ' i wanted to go a year or two into the future and imagine the @entity0 for everyone , the one that would do for peripherals what the @entity15 did for smartphones , and constraint my design to something that could be technically feasible , ' said @entity22 , the @entity40 designer who created the concept			1
' i completely drifted away form the aggressive shapes normally found in gaming hardware			2
' the consumer @entity45 needs to be subtle and friendly , it does n’t need ornaments to stand out			0
' it also needs to be approachable , as it faces the risk of intimidating the consumer			0
' the concept comes just weeks after @entity2 was been given @entity53 antitrust approval to buy @entity54 in a $ 2bn deal , the @entity50 has revealed			1

however , once our demo started , doubts were quickly forgotten			0
the technology , still just a developer 's version , is breathtakingly good			1
while the resolution still does n't give the feeling of quite being in the real world , it does make you think you are actually in a virtual world			1
during several demonstrations we entered a vast dungeon and flew through space , with head tracking meaning the images moved perfectly as the user 's head moves			0
it 's not quite ready for primetime yet , but is almost there - and the @entity0 headset finally delivers on the long awaited promise of virtual reality			1

' but this is just the start			0
