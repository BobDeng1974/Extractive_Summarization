the rightful owner of a £ 400,000 house handed to a squatter by a high court judge today furiously asked : ‘ how can this man sleep at night ? ’ builder @entity6 spent several years renovating the three - bedroom semi-detached property but had lived in it for just a few months when he applied for permanent possession			1
the chief land registrar turned him down but mr @entity12 overturned the ruling - despite accepting @entity6 had been committing criminal trespass			1
@entity6 won the right to the house in @entity17 , @entity18 , east @entity19 after squatting in it for years the registrar ’s decision was ‘ founded on an error of law ’ , he said , and previous legislation that treated squatting as a civil matter should apply			1
the house , in @entity28 , north east @entity19 , originally belonged to widow @entity29 , who died aged 88 in the late 1980s			1
her shocked son @entity30 , 78 , who lives in sheltered accommodation , revealed he had no idea the house had been handed to a stranger until the @entity35 approached him after the hearing			1
the house formerly belonged to the mother of @entity40 , but he rarely visited after he was attacked in the area , neighbours say ‘ how can this man sleep at night ? i did n’t know a thing about this case or that anyone had moved into the house , ’ he said from his flat in @entity43			1
the former tube station kiosk owner moved into the house after getting divorced in 1978 because his mother was getting ‘ fragile ’			1
he stayed there after she died and only left in 1996 when he inherited another property from an aunt			2
‘ i left the house as it was			2
i should have done something but there were a lot of personal problems , ’ he added			0
‘ my daughter @entity60 died from breast cancer in 1990 and my son @entity62 died five ago aged 49 from liver disease			1
’ despite never visiting the house , he continued paying council tax until four years ago when @entity66 sent a letter saying it was no longer necessary			2
he added : ‘ they did n’t say why			0
i just assumed it was to do with the state of the house , not that someone else was living there			2
they should have told me			0
’ mr @entity40 ’s mp yesterday said the case raised concerns about the rights still given to squatters			0
@entity80 @entity79 said : ‘ this case highlights the need for further examination of the law , which should give precedence to the rightful owner of the property			2
the ruling means homeowners do not automatically have legal protection against someone who occupies their home in september 2012 squatting in @entity93 and @entity94 became a criminal offence			0
squatting in residential buildings can lead to six months in prison , a £ 5,000 fine , or both			0
before it became a crime , squatters could take ownership of the property by virtue of having lived in it for a certain period of time			0
the duration in which a squatter needed to live in a property before they could apply to be registered as proprietor of the land was dependent on whether the land was registered or unregistered			0
unregistered land meant a squatter could claim ownership after a period of 12 years adverse possession of it			0
if the land was registered land and they occupied it for 10 years they could apply to be registered owner of the land			2
if the squatter is not entitled to be registered , the registered owner then had two years to obtain possession against the squatter			2
if this did not happen - the squatter remained in possession and could apply once again for registration as owner			2
but in light of the new law , when mr @entity6 tried to register the land his request was blocked because squatting is now illegal			1
but following the judge 's ruling , his case is now a landmark victory for ' squatters ' rights ' as even though squatting is ' criminalised ' by the government he has still been allowed ownership			1
source : @entity150 ‘ if you have a law which allows someone to grab a property - even if no one bothers them - then it ’s an open invitation for squatters			0
’ @entity159 , the @entity160 mp for @entity161 , added the court ruling raised ‘ very serious issues ’			0
‘ this could set a precedent and will lead to protracted and difficult legal disputes			0
the government needs to clarify the position urgently , ’ he said			0
mr @entity6 , 45 , told the @entity169 in @entity19 he was working on a property in 1997 when the owner mentioned the occupant of a nearby house had died and her son had not been seen for some time			1
he began renovating the house and treated it ‘ as his own ’ from 2001 , although it was not until january 2012 that he moved in			1
@entity179 said he parks a @entity181 car outside			1
his unsuccessful application for adverse possession to the chief land registrar was submitted in november that year - a few weeks after squatting was criminalised under section 144 of the @entity187			0
the law was introduced to stop the scandal of law - abiding owners being barred from their own properties and having to pay expensive court costs to evict squatters			0
but mr @entity12 said it was intended to deal with squatters who ‘ exploited the civil law ’s delays to fortify the house against the owner ... at a cost to [ the owner ] which was unlikely to be recovered ’			1
adverse possession was still possible in any private property where at least ten years had passed ‘ without effective action by the owner ’			1
the registrar was ordered to make an interim cost payment of £ 100,000 to mr @entity6 ’s legal team , who brought the action on a no - win , no - fee basis			1
total costs are expected to be in the region of £ 200,000			0
however , the judge did grant the right to appeal as his ruling will affect similar cases			0
@entity179 in @entity219 were outraged by the decision			1
one , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ it ’s totally wrong he [ @entity6 ] has been able to do this			2
he ’s trespassed and got a free house out of it			1
‘ people are very angry - everyone else has had to save up and pay off their mortgage			0
’ the @entity230 said the only enquiries it made were with the @entity232 to see if an executor of mrs @entity29 ’s estate had been appointed but ‘ nothing was revealed ’			0
after the hearing on wednesday a man answering a phone registered to mr @entity6 claimed not to be him			1
he said : ‘ he ’s gone abroad - he left earlier today			0
’ @entity239 , of @entity19 law firm @entity240 which represented @entity6 , said : ‘ the judgement recognises that making residential squatting a criminal offence was not intended to impact on the law of adverse possession			2

builder @entity6 ' treated the house as his own ' after hearing it was empty
owner died and her son had not visited since he was attacked in the area
high court judge rules the house is @entity6 's *due* to ' no action by the owner '
@entity179 furious that builder ' trespassed and got a free house out of it '
