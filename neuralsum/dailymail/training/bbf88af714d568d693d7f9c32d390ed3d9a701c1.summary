by @entity0 published : 11:29 est , 6 january 2014 updated : 12:44 est , 6 january 2014 shopping is fun , but dragging a reluctant man around the shops with you can diminish the pleasure somewhat			0
for women in @entity9 , however , help is at hand with the introduction of ' husband storage ' - fully equipped rooms where men can sit down , have a little sleep , and tut about their wives ' spending habits to their hearts ' content			2
shopping malls across the country are introducing laogong jicun chu ( literal translation : ' husband cloakroom ) which have proved a huge hit with spendthrift husbands who do n't want to trail around the shops			1
a trip to the shopzzzz : husbands in @entity9 catch up on sleep at a ' husband cloakroom ' while their wives shop husband cloakrooms , as indicated by the sign above , offer free internet , chairs , tables and even wifi to men see you later , darling : this sign shows weary men where their cloakroom is in a mall in @entity45 with chairs , tables , wifi and even a bar in some of them , they are attractive places for men who would rather snooze than cruise the mall			1
some have viewing platforms or glass sides so the men can try to keep tabs on their credit card - toting other halves as they dart from shop to shop			0
judging by these pictures , however , most men use them to simply have a break and rest their feet			0
one of the first husband cloakrooms appeared in @entity69 in 2010 , but they are now growing in popularity across the country and found in malls in @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 , among other places			1
not all the commenters on kotaku.com which highlighted the new trend were convinced by the innovation in husband daycare			0
one said : ' why do n't you just stay home ? are you afraid she 'll meet another man - one who likes shopping as much as she does ? ' men using this cloakroom in @entity74 in @entity88 , enjoy a drink while they check their emails welcome break : this restroom offers tired men in a mall in @entity75 , in @entity95 , a chance to sit down			2
