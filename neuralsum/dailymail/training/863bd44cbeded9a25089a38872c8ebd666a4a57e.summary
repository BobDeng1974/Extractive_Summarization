he used his time in @entity2 to speak out about the plight of @entity4 and meet refugees fleeing the war in @entity7			1
today , however , saw prince @entity8 see a very different side of the @entity10 as he flew into @entity11 to be met by pair of adorable flower girls			1
@entity8 , who is on a six - day tour to the @entity15 , was all smiles as they handed him a posy at the private @entity19 alongside the @entity15 state 's crown prince @entity20			1
the heir to the throne was then whisked out of the airport and into one of around 40 gleaming maroon @entity32 cars waiting for him outside			1
with the @entity20 , he then travelled on for a meeting with @entity11 's ruler , his highness @entity46 of @entity11 , sheik @entity46 , at the @entity47			1
the @entity46 , who last met @entity8 during a state visit to the @entity36 in 2012 , appeared to be quite a fan of the @entity50 and solicitously asked about her health through his official interpreter			1
' she is in remarkable form , ' replied @entity8 , adding : ' my father will turn 94 and he has very good eyesight			1
he is still out shooting			0
' his remark prompted approving laughter from the @entity46 , who looked even more delighted when @entity8 told him : ' they remember with great affection your visit in 2012 to the @entity36 '			1
not so fast : before he was driven away , he was introduced to local dignitaries at the airport greeting : he was met by @entity11 crown prince @entity20 at the private vip terminal at the airport inspection : an honour guard of troops in red uniform were lined up in the arrivals hall to meet him the emir replied , with obvious pride : ' i will not forget the remarkable happiness and generosity of her majesty			1
i was living next door to her , i was her neighbour			2
' by that point , @entity8 may have been forgiven for thinking the formalities were over but in accordance with @entity86 tradition , he was then ushered into a lavish lunch attended by 150 dignitaries , each of which he was required to greet and shake hands with			1
inside the dining room , the future king , a notoriously light eater who prefers to skip lunch , was offered dish after dish of fish and lobster delicacies			0
later , the prince attended a sunset ceremony , dressed in his tropical whites bearing his rank of @entity105 , on @entity36 destroyer , @entity104 , which is currently on operation in the @entity15			2
the ship , commissioned in 2010 , has been working with the @entity110 fleet in the region , as well as undertaking counter piracy and anti smuggling operations			0
impressed : @entity8 and his @entity11 counterpart inspected the troops before driving off in the convoy meeting : @entity8 met the emir of @entity11 who asked him about the health of his mother , the queen @entity8 watched as the ship 's flag was symbolically lowered at the end of the day and inspected some of its 200 - strong company			1
the prince , who was himself in the @entity128 for five years and rose to command a minesweeper , enthusiastically took a tour of the Â£ 1 billion vessel , described as the most advanced ship @entity36 has ever built			0
lieutenant commander @entity133 , second in command , said : ' the prince made a point of chatting to as many of the staff as possible , remembering the banter - which has n't changed in 30 years - and wanting to know about what it was like to work on such a world class destroyer			0
' it was a huge honour to welcome him			0
' @entity8 will stay overnight in @entity11 , a country he has visited on six previous occasions , before travelling onto the @entity146 , @entity147 and the @entity148			1
the prince is undertaking the tour at the request of the @entity152 , just a year after he last visited the region			2
sources said it is a sign of how important @entity146 is to the @entity36 and of how significant @entity8 's role is in fostering good relations			2
saying goodbye : @entity8 ' arrival in @entity11 came after he made a ceremonial departure from @entity2 royal wave : @entity8 waved goodbye to his @entity2 hosts from the doorway of the jet honour guard : as @entity8 departed , so did his @entity2 honour guard warm words : @entity8 met with @entity2 's @entity168 during his trip to the @entity10 country she 's back ! the @entity50 returns to @entity172 after quietly marking 63 years on the throne at @entity174 the @entity50 returned to @entity172 today , after spending @entity175 and all of january at her @entity177 home , @entity174			1
resplendent in a lilac wool coat and , unusually , without one of her trademark hats , she was seen marching along the platform at @entity183 station as she prepared to catch a train to the capital			0
with her was her team of close protection officers and a lady in waiting , all of whom followed her onto the train			0
on her way : the @entity50 prepares to board a train at @entity183 as she returns to @entity172 the @entity50 traditionally spends @entity175 at @entity174 and usually marks the anniversary of her accession to the throne at the @entity177 property			0
it was also at @entity174 that her father , @entity198 , died on the 6th february 1952			0
the @entity50 herself was in @entity200 at the time			0
@entity50 , who also arrived at @entity174 by train , has spent much of her annual visit relaxing with the @entity203 , although she has also made several official visits			2
as well as attending a @entity207 meeting , an annual tradition for the @entity50 , last monday visited @entity208			0
accompanied by the @entity203 , the 88 - year - old monarch toured the engine bay and met local firemen before officially opening the new facility			0
more of the same awaits on her return to @entity214 this afternoon , with both the @entity50 and prince @entity203 scheduled to complete a busy run of engagements between now and june 's visit to @entity218			0
elegant : @entity50 , who last week celebrated her 63rd year on the throne , was resplendent in lilac staying safe : the train was cleaned before the @entity50 arrived , overseen by police officers protection : the train and the platform were also checked for explosives ahead of the @entity50 's arrival			2
