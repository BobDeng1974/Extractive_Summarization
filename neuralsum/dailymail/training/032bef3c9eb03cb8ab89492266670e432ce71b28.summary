june 14 : @entity0 , 8pm , @entity1 june 19 : @entity2 , 8pm , @entity3 june 24 : @entity4 , 5pm , @entity5 follow all the action on @entity7 @entity8 remain confident that @entity9 will be fit to face @entity2 on june 19 - despite the striker having an operation on a knee injury today			1
@entity13 understands that officials believe the 27 - year - old is unlikely to be fit for the @entity17 opener against @entity0 , but that he could play five days later			1
@entity9 picked up the injury in training on wednesday and underwent meniscus surgery on thursday morning			1
despite @entity8 's optimism , he could still miss the tournament , given the worst case scenario for this type of injury is 16 weeks on the sidelines			1
out ? @entity9 is touch and go for the @entity17 after it was revealed he needs surgery on a knee injury major blow : @entity9 is @entity8 's talisman and is set to miss the whole of the first stage the striker - who was voted @entity34 for his performances at @entity36 this season - is @entity8 's talisman but is almost certain to miss up to between four to six weeks			1
and , in a direct boost to @entity2 's chances of progressing out of @entity39 , @entity9 may be out for the entirety of the first stage and beyond following results of an mri scan			1
a @entity8 @entity44 official said : ‘ it was all unexpected			1
the latest information is that we are deciding what to do , but there are increased possibilities ( involving surgery )			2
' i ca n’t tell you anything more			0
the @entity55 ( @entity56 ) will announce it officially on thursday morning			0
’ the @entity57 's are fancied as potential dark horses and face @entity60 's side as well as @entity4 and @entity0			1
@entity9 was checked over by medical staff on wednesday after picking up the knock in training just three weeks before the tournament starts in @entity64			1
the best case for @entity9 is recovery within four to six weeks , but with the final 23 - man squad needed to be ratified on june 2 , it leaves the country with very little wiggle room			1
any decision to include @entity9 from there - not match fit - would represent a sizeable risk			1
they wo n't be encouraged to know that @entity74 underwent meniscus surgery prior to the @entity76 in april and did n't play his first game for seven weeks			1
the worst case scenario for @entity9 is a four - month lay - off , which would heavily impact on @entity36 's start to the next campaign			1
the @entity81 are aware of the injury but have n't been officially informed			2
it 's your time again : @entity85 is set to become even more involved in the @entity8 frontline this summer knock : the @entity36 striker picked up the injury on wednesday and was immediately sent for an mri scan upset : the 27 - year - old is having meniscus surgery on thursday and could miss up to six weeks main man : @entity94 's @entity93 will have the task of firing the @entity57 to glory @entity9 : ( 77 caps , 38 goals ) @entity93 : ( 60 caps , 20 goals ) @entity85 : ( 107 caps , 36 goals ) @entity103 : ( 66 caps , 13 goals ) @entity106 : ( 11 caps , 7 goals ) the 27 - year - old arrived in @entity110 for training on tuesday morning , feeling discomfort in a session with @entity115 's squad on wednesday but continuing before encountering the major problem later in the evening			1
@entity117 , executive of the @entity55 , confirmed that they had attempted to keep the news under wraps			2
developments heap more pressure on @entity94 's @entity93 , who will lead the line when they face @entity0 on june 14			1
veteran @entity85 - so impressive in @entity123 four years ago - was expected to play a bit - part role but may now be needed alongside @entity93			1
they do still have other options , with @entity127 's @entity103 and @entity128 's @entity106 waiting in the wings			1
since he signed for @entity36 in january 2011 , he has not missed a single match because of fitness issues and has been regularly hailed by his team - mates and manager for his extraordinary durability and determination – he will always make himself available for training , even if he is carrying the type of slight tweak that would convince others to spend time in the medical room			0
should @entity9 be prevented from leading the 2010 semi-finalists in @entity64 , he would be left distraught			1
