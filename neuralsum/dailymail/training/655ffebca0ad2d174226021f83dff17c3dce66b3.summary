by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 03:54 est , 9 may 2013 the justice secretary pledged yesterday to ‘ turn the tide ’ of criminality as a raft of new measures were announced aimed at encouraging prolific offenders away from crime			1
tens of thousands of short - sentence prisoners will be put on compulsory supervision for at least 12 months after their release in a ‘ targeted rehabilitation ’ programme , said @entity14			1
compulsory drug testing for thousands of burglars , robbers and drug offenders will be extended so they can be hauled back to jail if caught using cannabis			1
current tests cover only class a drugs			1
@entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 stand in the @entity26 to listen the @entity28 's speech , which included a raft of measurements designed to rehabilitate prolific criminals the measures , revealed in the @entity33 , are included in a new draft law , the @entity35 , which will be published in full today			1
inmates will serve the final months of their jail term near home in ‘ resettlement jails ’ designed to prepare them for release			1
the measurements aim to make a dent in the ' appetite of offenders ' once out , they will be prevented from moving around the country and will have to work at rebuilding their lives			1
the former convicts will have to seek permission to move out of their local area to ensure they stick to community orders , instead of merely notifying probation as at present			1
paedophiles , rapists and convicted terrorists will be placed on gps tags so their movements can be monitored at all times			1
and vast swathes of the @entity62 will be contracted out to private companies and charities paid ‘ by results ’ if they turn criminals into honest citizens			1
opponents said this could lead to the public being put at risk if private firms put profit ahead of safety			1
mr @entity14 said he wanted to ‘ put a stopper in the revolving door of the justice system ’ which sees as many as six in ten short - sentence offenders return to crime within a year of their release			1
‘ tackling our stubbornly high reoffending rates has dogged successive governments for decades , ’ he said			2
‘ these reforms represent a golden opportunity to finally turn the tide			2
‘ it is simply not good enough that we spend £ 4billion a year on prisons and probation and yet make no real dent in the appetite of offenders to commit more crime			2
@entity14 wants to ' put a stopper in the revolving door of the justice system ' ‘ it is little wonder when many of our most prolific criminals leave prison totally unsupervised in the community			1
‘ these reforms are essential and will ensure that offenders are properly punished but also given targeted support to help them turn away from crime for good			2
’ mr @entity14 hopes to save millions by using private firms and charities to run rehabilitation projects outside the state sector			1
he told the @entity112 4 today programme this morning that the focus would be on finding efficiencies and there would be no extra money for the extra work			2
' we have a system at the moment where only around 25 per cent of probation officers ' time is spent working with offenders			2
something like 40 per cent of the resources is spent support costs , ' he said			2
' we have reoffending rates that are rising among offenders jailed for less than a year			2
at the moment they walk out onto the streets with £ 46 in their pockets and that 's it			0
that can not be a sensible system and it needs to change			0
' he continued : ' we are talking about 250,000 people a year being supported through probation at the moment			0
this ( reform ) will bring another 50,000 people into the net for the first time			0
i am going to pay for that with a system that is less bureaucratic and more efficiently run			0
' but criminal justice analyst and former probation officer @entity148 said : ‘ there is no evidence that probation is failing			1
the experience of privatisation so far has been extremely disappointing			0
‘ all the evidence shows that probation has met all its targets and there is a real risk that public protection will be compromised if this controversial scheme goes ahead			0
’ currently , prisoners serving 12 months or less are not given probation support when behind bars , and can spend as little as a few days in touch with their probation officer on release			0
this group of offenders committed more than 80,000 crimes in the year after their release			0
from 2015 , all inmates will be given support services while in jail irrespective of the length of their sentence			0
and all will spend at least a year being monitored in the community after release			0
during this period , they will be required to undergo drug rehab , skills training and other programmes to help them reform			1
owners of dangerous dogs that maul children on private property will face jail			0
the government is closing a loophole which has left police unable to bring prosecutions even in fatal cases			0
the new law will also apply to attacks on postmen and other visitors to private houses or gardens			0
ministers defied the anger of @entity205 as they unveiled plans to ‘ fast - track ’ the government ’s controversial £ 33billion high - speed @entity208 rail scheme			0
the government said it was ‘ cracking on ’ at a pace with the flagship project , insisting : ‘ it will become a matter of when , not if , the entire 351 miles of new railway will be built			0

new measures include gps tags for paedophiles , resettlement jails and compulsory drug testing
