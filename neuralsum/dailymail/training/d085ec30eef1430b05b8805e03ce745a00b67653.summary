by @entity0 published : 06:03 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 2 july 2013 the forecast was for blue skies and sunshine , but weathergirl @entity6 's reaction was a face of thunder			1
the presenter was caught revealing her frustration shortly after her 10.30pm report on @entity12 last night			1
the 31 - year - old had been all smiles as she predicted warm weather for @entity16 the rest of the week			0
but when the camera remained on her , ms @entity6 could be seen rolling her eyes and flicking her hair in an apparent display of contempt			1
some thought that her anger was directed at news anchor @entity38			1
one wrote : ' omg ! did anyone see the eye rolling from @entity6 at the end of the weather tonight			2
tut tut ! me thinks you do n't like @entity38 ' another said : ' @ @entity56 you should wait till the camera is off you before you pull the ' i could n't give a s * * * ' face ' ' @ @entity60 providing much amusement on this sofa with a post-weather eye roll and ' what evs ' face , ' wrote another			0
plenty of viewers noticed the candid moment caught on camera and took to @entity32 to make comments twitter user @entity72 was among those who found ms @entity6 's unimpressed expression amusing reaction : ms @entity6 quickly went onto @entity32 herself to explain her ' roll of the eyes ' sense of humour : the presenter was able to see the funny side of being caught venting her frustration on camera @entity85 : earlier @entity6 had seemed bright and breezy during the forecast hiding her feelings : ms @entity6 said she had been frustrated at a series of technical problems during the broadcast but ms @entity6 soon took to twitter herself claiming that she was simply frustrated at a series of technical faults which had hampered the broadcast			1
she wrote : ' the roll of the eyes was because i had to do the whole forecast without being able to see any graphics - it was n't at @entity38 ! # techfail ' ' and clearly i was kept cut up in frame while i took out my frustration on the nearest and inanimate object ( green wall of the studio ) ! ' the presenter was able to see the funny side of the gaffe , even comparing it to the @entity110 film anchorman			2
' it 's actually really funny , even i have to admit			0
our world is just like @entity109 , ' she later tweeted			0
support : @entity6 , left , sparked a @entity32 storm with her eyeroll but she was given support by her colleague and news anchor @entity38 , right , who said she had been frustrated by technical problems and ms @entity6 was backed up by her news anchor @entity38 who tweeted that her explanation was true			1
she tweeted : ' thankfully it was not me phew ! she was not impressed with the technical fail of having no weather graphics			0
' ' ok so it was one of the more ' interesting ' late bulletins shall we say			0
and your comments made @ @entity56 and i chuckle			0
' @entity12 spokesperson said : ' @entity12 has recently moved very successfully into a new studio			2
last night we had a couple of technical problems which meant that @entity6 could n’t see the weather graphics and the camera lingered on her too long at the end of the forecast			1
' @entity6 unfortunately did n’t realise she was still in shot			0

presenter @entity6 , 31 , caught revealing face of thunder after report
