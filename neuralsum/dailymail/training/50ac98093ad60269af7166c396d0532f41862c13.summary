by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 09:21 est , 21 january 2013 the discovery of a ' quadruple helix ' in human cells could be a key to fighting cancer , say the @entity7 researchers who made the findings			1
they come almost exactly 60 years after @entity9 and @entity10 burst in to the pub next to their @entity7 lab excitedly proclaiming that they had found the secret of life in the double helix structure of @entity17			1
quadruple helixes intertwine four rather than two strands of dna , and had been created in the lab by curious researchers , but it was generally thought that they did n't exist in nature			0
the quadruple helix had only been seen when it was created by researchers in test tubes , but now scientists have identified them in cancer cells but now these quadruple helixes - or g - quadruplexes - have been found in cancer cells , according to a study published in @entity34			1
the quadruple helix might be unique to human cancer cells - and the discovery means that cancer drugs to target these unusual dna structures could be developed			1
' we are seeing links between trapping the quadruplexes with molecules and the ability to stop cells dividing , which is hugely exciting , ' said professor @entity46 from the @entity7 ’s @entity47 and @entity48			0
@entity46 stands in front of a painting called ' @entity51 ' by artist @entity52 at his office in @entity7 's @entity47 @entity7 scientists @entity10 and @entity9 with a model of the double helix of dna , which they discovered in 1953 the research , which has been funded by @entity59 , shows clear links between concentrations of four - stranded quadruplexes and the process of dna replication , which is pivotal to cell division and production			1
@entity17 , or deoxyribonucleic acid , is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms			2
nearly every cell in a person ’s body has the same dna			0
@entity17 was first isolated by the @entity74 physician @entity73 who , in 1869 , discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages			1
as it resided in the nuclei of cells , he called it nuclein			0
in 1953 , @entity7 scientists @entity9 and @entity10 suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double - helix model of dna structure in the journal @entity86			2
their double - helix , molecular model of dna was then based on a single x-ray diffraction image taken by @entity91 and @entity92 in may 1952 cancers are usually driven by genes called oncogenes that have mutated to increase dna replication - causing cell proliferation to spiral out of control , and leading to tumour growth			2
the increased dna replication rate in oncogenes leads to an intensity in the quadruplex structures			0
this means that potentially damaging cellular activity can be targeted with synthetic molecules or other forms of treatments			0
' this research further highlights the potential for exploiting these unusual dna structures to beat cancer - the next part of this pipeline is to figure out how to target them in tumour cells , ' said dr @entity117 , senior science information manager at @entity59			2
@entity46 told the @entity118 : ' i 'm hoping now that the pharmaceutical companies will bring this on to their radar and we can perhaps take a more serious look at whether quadruplexes are indeed therapeutically viable targets			0
' he added : ' the quadruple helix dna structure may well be the key to new ways of selectively inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells			1
' the confirmation of its existence in human cells is a real landmark			0

structure only seen in test tubes found in human cancer cells
