@entity0 has revealed he tried to sign @entity1 for @entity2 in the summer , but has no doubt he has the class to thrive at the very highest level with @entity6			1
@entity7 boss @entity0 has history with the @entity10 striker , having taken him to @entity11 on loan in 2010 - 11 , and was keen to renew their acquaintance when it became clear @entity1 's @entity16 days were numbered			1
he admits @entity2 's interest never got past an initial enquiry , with heavyweight suitors from home and abroad vying for the 23 - year - old 's signature , and accepts the player deserves to be among the @entity25 elite			1
' i rang his brother ( and agent , @entity40 ) but there was some rather big clubs in for him , ' said @entity0 , whose side take on the @entity44 at the @entity45 on saturday			2
' i think @entity46 were in there , @entity6 as well of course , and one or two from @entity50 as well			0
' he had a pick shall we say but , yes , we had a dabble			0
' i 've got no doubt in my mind after working with him that he can play at any top four side , no question			0
he 's a top player			0
' he 's played a lot on the left ( for @entity16 ) and then people start criticising his goalscoring record , but you put him down the middle as a striker and he will score			2
' the 23 - year - old striker has had a successful start to his @entity6 career since his summer move to the @entity45 , and on saturday he will face @entity0 's @entity2 at the @entity69 @entity0 , as a former @entity71 captain , was surprised to see his old club cash in on one of their brightest homegrown talents but understands the dilemma @entity77 faced balancing his forward options			1
' they 've made changes at @entity16 and decided he 's surplus but i believe he can play in any top team around @entity50 , ' said @entity0			1
' when you 've got ( @entity85 ) @entity84 , ( @entity86 ) @entity87 and ( @entity88 ) @entity88 you 've got a decision to make but it surprised me because not often do you see @entity16 selling a very good young player			0
' the proof will come over time whether they regret it but i 'm sure it will work out for him at @entity6			0
