at the @entity3 last month , one of the most gifted players of his generation was given the run of the place during @entity7 ’s 2 - 1 victory			1
it was an exhibition from the very best			2
@entity9 took 112 touches in @entity7 ’s midfield , five more than his celebrated team - mate @entity12 and far more than any player in a @entity15 shirt			1
@entity16 , anointed by @entity17 as one of his team ’s most important players , was the highest with 64			0
the numbers simply do n’t add up , which is one of the reasons @entity25 football is struggling to make an impact over two legs in @entity29 ties			0
when will our game learn ? probably never			0
@entity9 , rested in @entity7 's win over @entity33 , is expected to return to the starting line - up against @entity15 @entity7 's @entity36 midfielder @entity35 controls the ball as @entity38 and @entity39 look on during training @entity41 aims a friendly kick at fellow @entity7 striker @entity43 after the @entity44 had gone down the @entity46 captain was in high spirits as @entity7 prepared for their @entity29 last 16 second leg ‘ we play in a comprehensive manner and we want possession so that they suffer , ’ admitted @entity9 as he prepares to pull on the red and blue stripes of @entity7 once more			1
‘ we need to find our superior skills and minimise their potential			0
we want to control what goes on in every moment			0
we have to beat @entity15 with a complete performance			2
’ @entity7 are conditioned to play a certain way , all possession - based and keeping the ball in circulation until they can find a way through the gaps in @entity15 ’s defence			1
@entity9 is a slave to the game , a man still seeking perfection even after three triumphs in the @entity29 , plus two @entity70 and the @entity71 , in which he scored the winner for @entity73			1
@entity7 will be hoping to reach the @entity29 quarter finals by holding off @entity75 @entity7 have not failed to reach @entity77 's last eight since 2007 , and saw off @entity15 at the same stage last season his incredible strike against @entity82 in the 2009 @entity29 semi-final , second leg at @entity85 is one of the most dramatic goals in the history of the game			1
at the age of 30 , he wants more			0
‘ we do not gather as a team to discuss what we can achieve , but the important thing is that we know what the possibilities are , ’ he added			0
‘ there are no guarantees , but we know that we are doing well and we are prepared for this match			0
’ @entity101 ’s team are in fine fettle , a point ahead of @entity104 at the top of @entity106 ahead of @entity107 on sunday and on course for the @entity29 quarter - final if they can protect their 2 - 1 advantage			1
the @entity7 players move the ball around during a training exercise ahead of the vital showdown with @entity15 manager @entity101 will be hoping his team take another step on the road towards @entity118 the final of the @entity123 awaits later in the season , when @entity9 can add to his extensive list of honours when @entity101 ’s team face @entity125			1
‘ we do n’t think beyond @entity15 because we have to concentrate , even if we had a good result in the first leg , ’ he said			1
‘ right now the team is in good shape , but this is a difficult period of the season			0
we are in the final of @entity123 , the @entity29 and all the little details will play a role tomorrow			0
‘ on sunday we have an important match against our rivals , but this is the @entity29 and @entity15 have great players			2
’ @entity9 is wary of the threat posed by former @entity7 midfielder @entity138 much will be expected of @entity138 , returning from suspension to play against his former team at the @entity141 as @entity15 attempt to overturn a 2 - 1 deficit			1
this will be a tough night for a team who can not keep the ball , but @entity138 ’s goalscoring ability , along with those powerful runs that start from deep - lying positions , could give them a chance			2
@entity9 added : ‘ he is very important for them , he is very powerful physically and he has important qualities because of all his skills			2
‘ we ’ll try to minimise his potential			0

@entity7 train ahead of crucial last 16 second leg at the @entity141
@entity161 side lead @entity15 2 - 1 after first leg , when @entity43 scored twice
@entity9 *insists* tie is not over and says @entity7 are fully focused
