the first mysterious camera - mounted car was spotted in @entity2 last week , and now new sightings of @entity5 's minivans have been posted online			1
at least two videos - one recorded in @entity2 , another filmed in @entity8 - suggest the top - secret project is more widespread than first thought			1
and rumours range from a @entity13 - style mapping service to an electric car that will rival @entity15 or a self - driving van to rival @entity17			1
at least two videos - one recorded in @entity2 , another filmed in @entity8 ( pictured ) - suggest the top - secret project is more widespread than first thought the @entity2 footage was sent to @entity23 and shows a silver people - carrier driving down a street in @entity26			1
the @entity8 recording was filmed on a highway in @entity29 and uploaded by @entity30			0
this footage shows a white @entity31 fitted with cameras on the roof			0
as the filmmaker pulls alongside the van , they wave at the two men inside			0
the passenger is seen concealing an @entity39 from view , while the driver points to the camera and drives off			2
claims that @entity5 is building a car may seem like a leap , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the @entity2 firm			1
in an interview last year , @entity5 board member @entity50 said that before his death in 2011 @entity52 had considered building a car			2
he told @entity55 : ' @entity52 was gon na design an @entity56			0
' i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' other reports have spotted the vans in @entity63 and @entity64			0
the latest vans have n't officially been confirmed as belonging to @entity5 , but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are			2
the far - reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims @entity5 is developing a mapping service			1
with 12 cameras on top of the car , however , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity17 's @entity13			1
plus , reports recently claimed @entity5 has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. this project has been dubbed ' @entity84 '			1
this @entity5 research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away - and is being overseen by @entity5 designer sir @entity87			2
@entity5 could , of course , be using the vans for both projects			2
the @entity91 added that hundreds of employees are working on the @entity84 project and boss @entity94 approved the project close to a year ago			2
the @entity8 recording ( pictured ) was filmed in @entity29			0
this footage shows a white @entity31 fitted with cameras on the roof			0
as the filmmaker pulls alongside the van , they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an @entity39 from view the @entity2 footage ( pictured ) was sent to @entity23 and shows a silver people - carrier driving down a street in @entity26 these reports followed rumours that @entity5 was developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity15 a run for its money			1
' the claims were made in an email from an unnamed @entity5 employee			2
in an interview last year , @entity5 board member @entity50 said that before his death in 2011 , @entity52 had considered building a car			2
a unnamed @entity5 employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity15 a run for its money			1
' it followed sightings of an @entity5 - owned car fitted with cameras ( pictured ) in @entity2 in particular , @entity5 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity15 's range ( the @entity135 is pictured ) or the email could be referring to an advanced @entity139 in - car control system that would rival @entity15 's software the head of self - driving cars for @entity17 expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			1
@entity145 said the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity17 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			0
but mr @entity145 would n't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse , saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly			0
he told reporters last month at the @entity156 in @entity157 that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars			0
he told @entity55 : ' @entity52 was gon na design an @entity56			0
i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' alternatively , the @entity5 employee 's email could be referring to an advanced @entity139 in - car control system that would rival @entity15 's software			1
the original @entity171 van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog @entity174 in @entity176			0
the blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing , but he refused to give an answer			0
the @entity182 ( @entity183 ) confirmed the vehicle was leased to @entity5			0
last year , footage emerged of a self - driving @entity31 that looked like the current @entity5 minivans			1
when contacted by @entity187 , @entity5 declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was			2
with 12 cameras on top of the mysterious @entity5 car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity17 's @entity13 ( pictured left )			1
@entity17 launched its @entity13 technology in 2007 , and has refined the technology ever since ( @entity13 screenshot near @entity201 in @entity202 pictured right ) alternatively , the vehicles spotted in @entity2 and @entity8 could be self - driving cars			1
the cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software , for example			0
if @entity5 was developing such systems , they would would rival @entity17 's self - driving cars ( pictured )			1

at least two videos , in @entity2 and @entity8 , have been posted online
this suggests the top - secret project is more widespread than first thought
rumours range from a @entity13 - style service to a @entity15 - style electric car
in the @entity8 video , the passenger is seen concealing an @entity39
the far - reaching nature of the project adds weight to mapping rumours
but reports claims @entity5 is building a self - driving ' @entity84 ' car in a secret lab
alternatively , the tech giant could be using the vehicles for both projects
