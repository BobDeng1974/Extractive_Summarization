@entity2 requested the role be given to sir @entity34 , but he told @entity35 he is now too old at 79 to undertake the book			2
sir @entity34 said of the diaries yesterday : ‘ it may well be she thought they might be distressing for others , and she saw no point in that			0
’ he said he had not read them but conceded they may well contain revelations or observation about her family or sex life that could be upsetting			1
the book could take ‘ the best part ’ of ten years to complete , he said , and another biographer would be appointed			2
sir @entity34 said the writer would have no restrictions and would be able to publish the biography because extracts from the diaries would be put into their wider context			0

ms @entity103 said yesterday : ‘ my mother lived a long , very complex life			0
she was the most extraordinary human being			0
