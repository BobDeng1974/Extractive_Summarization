by @entity0 a mother - of - two is recovering after becoming paralysed during a @entity3 class			1
@entity4 , 32 , was taking part in her regular exercise class when her legs suddenly stopped working			1
ms @entity4 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , was horrified as her lower body slowly became paralysed , and she was unable to use her legs or feet			1
@entity4 , 32 , suddenly lost the ability to use her legs and was paralysed during a @entity3 class but remarkably , a year after her ordeal began , she is finally on the road to recovery			1
she said : ‘ i was in my @entity3 class last july when the instructor asked us to run on the spot and i just could n’t do it			0
‘ i could n’t move my legs properly and i just had no idea what was wrong			0
‘ i told my friend and she joked that i was being lazy , but i could tell that there was something seriously wrong			0
‘ as a swimming teacher i ’m usually really active and i went to @entity3 at least twice a week , so it was really worrying			0
‘ as time went on i could n’t move my legs and feet were completely numb - i was basically paralysed from the waist down			0
’ in hospital , ms @entity4 was diagnosed with a rare condition which occurs when the immune system starts to attack the nerves causing them to become inflamed ms @entity4 was released from hospital after two weeks and it was thought she had recovered but she soon developed symptoms again and had to return to hospital with partial paralysis after continuously experiencing the strange symptoms , ms @entity4 was eventually diagnosed with a rare condition called @entity46 ( @entity46 )			1
guillain - barré syndrome ( pronounced @entity47 ) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body 's senses and movements			1
@entity46 ( pronounced @entity47 ) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body 's senses and movements			1
it affects about 1,500 people in the @entity57 every year and is slightly more common in men than women			0
it causes the immune system ( the body ’s natural defence against infection and illness ) to attack these nerves , causing them to become inflamed			2
symptoms include a tingly , numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement			2
most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before			0
around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months , and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage			1

around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months , and do not have lasting problems			1
ms @entity4 said : ‘ at @entity99 the doctors began to test my reflexes and i did n’t have any - that was a clear sign that i had @entity46			1
‘ as soon as they told me i rang my mum - she was really worried because she knew someone that had it before			0
‘ the doctors explained to me what it was in a roundabout way , but it was only when i looked at some information myself that i really understood the full extent of the condition			2
‘ i was horrified - i ’d never heard of @entity46 before and all of sudden i was reading that i could become completely paralysed , it was really scary			2
‘ i was told they would start me on some treatments but as the condition progressed i could n’t walk or put any pressure on my legs			2
‘ luckily after about 12 days i was back on my feet again , but i knew something still was n’t right			0
’ unfortunately , after contracting @entity46 , ms @entity4 went on to develop an extremely rare form of the condition known as chronic inflammatory axonal polyneuropathy ( @entity128 )			1
when ms @entity4 's symptoms returned , she was found to have an extremely rare and more serious form of @entity46			1
she is pictured with her daughters ms @entity4 spent months experiencing bouts of partial paralysis and , nearly a year on , still requires crutches to get around			1
this is because she still has numbness in her legs and feet as well as balance problems ms @entity4 said : ‘ two weeks after i left hospital - supposedly recovered - i was back in again			1
‘ all my symptoms were back again , and they seemed even worse			0
‘ at first doctors thought i just was n’t handling my symptoms properly , but finally after even more tests and investigations , i was diagnosed with the @entity128 form of the condition at the end of last year			1
‘ this form of the condition affects the inner nerves , where as normal @entity46 affects the outer - the type i have is considered to be more serious			1
‘ it was a relief to get the diagnosis but i felt so unlucky - most people just get @entity46 and eventually recover , but i had to be the one to get this			0
‘ it affects only about one or two people in every six million			0
’ ms @entity4 ( pictured in hospital ) still does not know if she will ever make a full recovery ms @entity4 spent the next few months in and out of hospital experiencing bouts of paralysis and constant problems with tingling and numbness			1
she went through phases of being paralysed from the waist down and struggled to get around because of numbness and problems with her balance			0
but remarkably , after suffering from the condition for almost a year , she is starting to show signs of recovery			2
she said : ‘ i underwent a lot of treatment , and i ’m now on my feet again , but i do still need crutches			0
‘ i have been taking aloe vera supplements which i think have played a big part in my recovery as it gives me more energy			0
‘ i could potentially stop progressing at any point , so it ’s quite scary , but i just have to stay positive and take everything day by day			0
ms @entity4 said : ' i underwent a lot of treatment , and i 'm now on my feet again , but i do still need crutches ' ‘ my balance is still quite poor , but i just have to keep going			2
‘ i ’m back at work as a swimming teacher so i stay active , and i have two little girls that that keep me busy			0
‘ although my @entity46 journey has been a long and complicated one , doctors believe the symptoms have finally slowed , and my life should finally be getting back to normal			2
’ @entity195 , director of the @entity196 which provides support for people with @entity46 , said : ‘ @entity46 is an uncommon illness that causes weakness and a loss of sensitivity , affecting about 1,500 people in the @entity57 a year			1
‘ it will start with a tingling or loss of feeling in the toes and fingers and progresses from there			0
ms @entity4 said : ' i could potentially stop progressing at any point , so it 's quite scary , but i just have to stay positive and take everything day by day ' ‘ in a worst case scenario it can cause total paralysis , and about 10 per cent of people will die as a result of it			2
‘ a similar amount of people will be left with very severe residual effects , but the majority of people make a full recovery			1
‘ there is no known cause for @entity46 , although we often find people who suffer from it may have just had a stomach bug or some kind of infection			0
‘ chronic inflammatory axonal polyneuropathy ( @entity128 ) is a very rare type of @entity46 which affects the inner nerves - it is a condition that usually affects @entity239 people , so @entity4 ’s case is unusual			1
‘ if we eventually find the cause of @entity46 , we hope that we could find a cure			0
