in doing so , @entity2 recorded his 12th consecutive victory and the eighth successive title defence			1

but he was quickly into his stride in the fight , aiming an axe kick at @entity6 ’s head before following up with several swipes up top			1
@entity6 was then taken down for the first time in his @entity29 career but recovered quickly only to be sent backwards by a straight left			1

the attacks continued to come from the challenger as he landed an uppercut and while @entity2 mounted a response , it was n’t enough to stop the round slipping away			2
encouraged by his corner , @entity6 looked for a repeat performance in the third session but was temporarily halted by a stray finger in the eye			2
@entity6 , who twice represented his country at the @entity95 , went for a takedown but was thwarted by @entity2 ’ excellent defence			1
and it was the younger man who finished the round the stronger			0
ahead on my scorecard , @entity2 then produced an inspired opening 90 seconds of the fourth stanza , taking @entity6 down twice having also landed with his elbow and knee			1
@entity6 attempts to fend off yet another kick to the head from @entity2 in the main event at @entity4 182 @entity6 enjoyed success on the inside but struggled to last the pace against the younger man @entity6 's best moments came in rounds two and three as he landed punches on the champion @entity6 finally recorded a takedown in the final round but it was too little , too late for the challenger @entity2 ' former opponent @entity122 gave his opinion of his rival 's performance after the fight a dejected @entity6 leaves the arena after losing for the first time in mixed martial arts @entity2 ' next title defence will be against the winner of @entity122 's fight against @entity133 on january 24			1
and although @entity6 rose , he spent much of the remainder of the round with his back to the cage , looking visibly fatigued			2
and despite landing an early uppercut , @entity6 struggled to make an impression as the pair grappled in the centre of the @entity25 for the final five minutes			2
the challenger 's increasingly frustrated attempts to record a takedown failed to yield fruit until 50 seconds from the end , but @entity2 immediately sprung to his feet			2

@entity32 almost succeeded with a rear naked choke while a late armbar attempt was cut short by the bell			2
the pair remained on their feet for the second round but neither were prepared to let their hands go , much to the frustration of the crowd			0
@entity32 won his seventh successive fight as he closes in on a shot at lightweight champion @entity200 the third session , however , burst into life at the midway point when @entity32 connected with a vicious head kick and it was he who continued to be the aggressor			1
