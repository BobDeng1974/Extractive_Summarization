@entity1 entrepreneur @entity0 has seen his hard work and innovative ideas in the world of computer technology pay off big time , to the tune of $ 1.4 billion , and now he has set his sights on the sea - with a yacht			1
the @entity11 born @entity0 , a co-founder of @entity12 , has just launched @entity13 , a super-fast super yacht that took a year to build at cost millions of dollars			1
the 100 - foot long cutting edge vessel is sleek , stylish and , according to @entity17 , can reach a top speed of around 40mph			1
that being said , it does seem like an odd hobby for a man who grew up in @entity45 , @entity11 , far from any coastline			0
' people spend money on sports and i just do n't do golf , i hate it , ' said the 70 - year - old			2
' but i love sailing and the technology aspect			0
' he became interested in sailing while in the @entity56 , and bought his first boat in the late 1980s			2
video courtesy of @entity60 van der @entity59 and @entity61 not cheap : the boat also cost millions to build maiden voyage : the yacht 's first race is expected to be the @entity66 in @entity67 this december good crew : the yacht 's skipper is @entity71 , the celebrated @entity1 sailor who grew up in @entity24 now , with @entity13 , he wants ' to be a record breaker			1
' he already plans on selling the boat in two years , and in that time has high hopes of not just winning events such as @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 , but breaking records as he takes the top spot			1
it had its maiden voyage off @entity24 , @entity25 , on october 13 , which was photographed by @entity86 , but @entity13 's first race will be the @entity66 in @entity67 this december , one that is a particular favorite for @entity0 and his @entity67 wife , @entity34			1
busy schedule : the boat is also expected to compete in events including @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 not competing : 70 - year - old @entity0 has said that he will not be on board for some of the more competitive races in his place : his much younger wife @entity34 , who is 35 , will likely be part of the crew in @entity32 that being said , the @entity66 is also one of the most difficult and competitive races of the year , and will be a true test for @entity13 and its 21 person crew led by skipper @entity71 , the very accomplished and celebrated 53 - year - old sailor who grew up in @entity24			1
the 1998 race featured a freak storm that ultimately left six people dead			0
' we want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records , ' said @entity71			2
' but to do that the conditions have to be right			0
you can have the greatest thing since sliced bread but you wo n't go record breaking if the weather 's not right			0
but if we get into the record books -- and we believe we will - then it 's job done			0
' priorities : @entity71 has said of breaking records with @entity13 , ' we want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records ' tough start : the boat 's first race , @entity32 - @entity66 , is considered one of the most competitive and had one of the most difficult courses late start : @entity71 did not even buy his first sailboat until the late 1980s and while @entity0 may be too old to be on board for some of the more competitive races , his 35 - year - old wife seems more than ready , starting on december 26 in @entity32			1
' my wife 's an @entity67 and a very competitive lady and she wants to sail in @entity66 , ' said @entity0			2
' i say " we have the boat , do as you wish			0
" i 'll let her run the show			0
