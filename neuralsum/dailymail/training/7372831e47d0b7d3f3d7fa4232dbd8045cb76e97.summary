the operation , led by the @entity9 , came amid fears that at least one major @entity12 bank may be teetering on the brink of collapse			0
the dramatic move to shore up the world 's creaking economy was undermined after the credit ratings agency @entity18 ’s downgraded its ratings on 15 global banks by one notch			1
all smiles : traders work on the floor of the @entity25 before the closing bell this afternoon cheered by traders : a view of a board on the floor of the @entity25 , as the @entity1 shot up the central banks of @entity12 , the @entity31 and others agreed to give banks cheaper access to loans in @entity31 dollars , which aims to avert a credit crisis like the one after @entity37 collapsed in 2008			1
the @entity1 jumped 490 points in its biggest gain since march 2009 - rising 4.2 per cent to close at 12,045			1
the @entity18 was up 52 points to 1,245 ; and the @entity41 jumped 105 points to 2,620			2

' cutting swap costs is the equivalent of interest rate cuts			0
the banks will be hoping this is a turning point in the crisis , ' economist @entity51 said			2
but last night @entity55 , of the @entity57 research consultancy , said the central banks ’ intervention would provide temporary relief for @entity12 , but warned that it was ‘ not a game changer ’			1
he added : ‘ welcome as the news was , we do not think it signals a turning point in the crisis			0
’ in a bleak assessment of the crisis engulfing @entity12 , a @entity70 government spokesman said : ‘ we are experiencing a credit crunch			0

they want to make it easier for banks to get dollars when needed and avert a credit crunch			2
non- @entity31 banks need dollars to fund @entity31 operations and make dollar loans to firms			1
but banks are afraid to lend because nobody is sure who holds bad government debt			2
if a @entity12 government defaults then it will probably put the @entity31 back into recession , so it is in everyone 's interests to avoid this			1
the central banks will reduce the cost of temporary dollar loans offered to banks - called liquidity swaps - to a half percentage point			1
the @entity9 noted banks were not having difficulty now getting funds in short - term markets - but it still has a ‘ range of tools ’ for use as a backstop			1

variations : this is a colour - coded table of credit ratings of euro zone nations , as well as the @entity31 and @entity151 compared : this graphic charts latest growth forecasts for major world economies from the @entity155 @entity156 said ' the @entity157 has more scope to go ' and it is expected to announce more measures in its next policy meeting on december 8			1

the @entity157 is helping the banking system while sovereigns do their homework , ' he said			0
the shock agreement came as @entity175 finance ministers met in @entity176 to discuss radical plans to address the debt crisis			0
it could see member states handing over control of their finances			0
leaders have been warned they have 10 days to complete a crisis response			0
@entity186 zone ministers agreed detailed plans to leverage the @entity188 ( @entity189 ) , but warned they may have to turn to the @entity190 for more help to avert financial disaster			0
