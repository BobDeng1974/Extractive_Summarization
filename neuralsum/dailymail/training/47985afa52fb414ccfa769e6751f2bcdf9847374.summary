on the lawn of a hotel garden next to the @entity4 , the blackening bodies of 53 people lay decomposing			1
some had their hands bound together , and bloodstains and spent rifle cartridges on the grass indicated they had been summarily executed where they fell			0
it was a scene from hell , but perhaps most chilling was the realisation that these were not victims of @entity17 ’s brutality			2
horror : corpses in the hotel gardenon the shore of the @entity4 rather they were , the evidence would suggest , victims of the ‘ good guys ’ , the supposedly democratic new friends of the @entity25 who have been ushered into power by @entity28 , @entity29 and the @entity30 for the bloodbath was in @entity17 ’s stronghold of @entity33 , and although the perpetrators are unknown , triumphalist graffiti on the walls of the hotel proclaimed the names of five @entity39 - based fighting groups			1
arguably , they suffered the greatest losses , and possibly fought the most intense battles , during the bloody siege of @entity45 ’s third - largest city when @entity17 threw everything he had at crushing the revolution there			2
few of the young @entity39 fighters would not have witnessed friends and comrades dying in agonising circumstances			2
was this , a massacre at the @entity55 in @entity17 ’s home town , their terrible revenge ? there are growing concerns about possible war crimes by rebel fighters who helped to oust @entity17 and now regard themselves as above the law			1
deserted : @entity33 - the last @entity17 stronghold to fall to the rebels - has become an eerie ghost town eerie : as the house where @entity17 hid stands in the background , a man walks in another part of @entity33 , where residents are slowly starting to return the @entity75 - based @entity74 yesterday demanded an inquiry into the atrocity at the hotel , warning of a ‘ trend of killings , looting and other abuses ’ by those who triumphed over @entity17 thanks only to the support of @entity28 ’s armed forces and those of our allies			1
@entity33 residents have placed most of the bodies at the @entity55 in bags and have been taking them away for burial			1
they identified four of the dead as @entity95 , allegedly a former @entity17 government official , a military officer named @entity98 , and two @entity33 residents , @entity100 and @entity101			1
the state of decomposition suggests the victims died at the same time , between october 14 and 19 , says @entity74			0
gruesome : burnt out cars and bodies of @entity17 bodyguards litter the area outside the @entity45 coastal town of @entity33 close to the drainage sewer from which @entity17 was dragged alive hotel from hell : the entrance to the @entity55 in @entity33 , where at least 53 people were apparently executed @entity115 : another picture inside the ville where @entity17 hid shows an untidy basement with mattresses scattered everywhere reduced to rubble : inside the villa where @entity17 hid , a wall is knocked through , while outside a nearby building remains battered with a burnt out car parked by its entrance most of them apparently fled @entity128 , the neighbourhood where @entity17 was hiding , and some had bandaged wounds , suggesting they had been patients in @entity33 ’s hospital at some stage			1
in @entity134 , it is as if a hurricane of bullets and shrapnel has ripped through the town , tearing chunks out of buildings – and people			2
bodies lie in the courtyards of homes and hundreds of thousands of spent rifle cartridges carpet every street			0
even the trees are shredded			0
@entity33 – the last @entity17 stronghold to fall to the rebels – is an eerie ghost town , but a few residents have begun returning			1
they stare in disbelief at the ruins of their homes , many of which seem to have been looted by the rebels			0
sewer capture : a picture shows the drainage sewer from which @entity17 was dragged alive , before meeting his death soon after person effects : used cups , including a @entity165 mug , are among the items found inside the villa where @entity17 hid for two weeks one resident fumed : ‘ this war is not over yet			1
this war has only just begun			2
’ but others are in a state of shock rather than anger			0
@entity174 , a 26 - year - old engineer , said : ‘ not everyone here supported @entity17 , and we had no choice that he came to hide here			2
‘ our homes have been wiped out and our friends and family lie dead in the streets			0
there was no need for this			0
’ his friend @entity186 , 27 , added : ‘ look at this place , at the bodies			0
it is an act of vengeance			0
’ @entity74 ’s emergencies director , @entity192 , last night urged the transitional authorities to ‘ take action to rein in these groups ’			0
n @entity17 is expected to be buried today in an unmarked grave at a secret location , according to a rebel spokesman .			1
