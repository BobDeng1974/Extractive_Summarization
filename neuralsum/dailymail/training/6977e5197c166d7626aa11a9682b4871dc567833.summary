heatwaves and prolonged spells of freezing weather have become more common over the past three decades , according to scientists			1
researchers at the @entity5 found that extreme weather conditions have been occurring more frequently in the past 30 years compared to a 130 year average			1
it comes as meteorologists have said that 2014 is on track to the be warmest year on record			1
according to the latest findings from the @entity5 's climatic research unit , temperatures in the northern hemisphere have been more volatile than in the southern hemisphere			1
extreme heatwaves in @entity33 like the one that killed tens of thousands in 2003 could happen every other year by 2040s , the @entity17 has warned			2
they claim that the chances of extreme heatwaves in @entity33 have increased from occurring once in every 1,000 years to around one a century			1
extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are also now likely to happen twice a decade , according to the research in the journal @entity43			2
dr @entity44 , co-author of the study , warned that projections of future climate change suggest that by the end of the century summers like that seen in 2003 could be considered ' unusually cool '			0
he said : ' this paper shows how our vulnerability to heat extremes is rapidly changing and we expect that to continue going forward			0
' professor @entity55 , who led the work , said : ' trends in extreme heat and cold are important because they have a large impact on water supplies , agricultural productivity and other factors related to human health and wellbeing			2
' improved understanding of the spatial patterns of change are vital for understanding the causes of recent extreme weather events			0
' the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal @entity74 , analysed monthly temperature records at set points around the world between 1881 and 2013			2
the found that on average through the 130 - year period , periods of unusually cold weather increased in frequency more than extreme heatwaves			1
this led to a narrowing of the range of the @entity89 's temperatures , they said			2
however , in the past 30 years , the researchers found that the pattern has been reversed with incidences of hot weather increasing at a faster rate			2
extreme weather can bring chaos to transport systems while causing billions of pounds worth of damage and hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world each year			0
average temperatures since 1850 show that 2014 is on course to be the warmest year on record an estimated 31,000 people died in the @entity105 as a result of bitter temperatures during the winter of 2012/2013			1
during december 2013 and january 2014 , 200 million people were blasted by icy temperatures as arctic winds brought heavy snow to much of @entity24			1
temperatures fell as low as -38 ° @entity114 ) in @entity115 while @entity116 saw its lowest temperature since 1979			0
the cold air reached as far south as @entity119 that reportedly saw temperatures plunge below − 9 ° @entity121 )			1
the conditions are estimated to have cost the @entity123 more than $ 5 billion and saw widespread power failures across large swathes of @entity126			0
in some areas , temperatures were so low that it led to residents being able to throw pots of boiling water and watching them freeze before the water hit the ground			0
by contrast , in 2003 , around 30,000 people died across @entity33 during a summer heatwave , where temperatures in some areas reached more than 104 ° f ( 40 ° c )			0
professor @entity141 , from @entity142 , who also took part in the study , said : ' arguably , these cold extremes and warm extremes are the most important factors for human society			0
' extreme cold weather like the @entity151 conditions that caused the @entity152 in @entity153 to freeze over in january 2014 have been growing more frequent in the past thirty years , according to new research heatwaves see sunseekers flock to the beach but they also bring high death tolls as some struggle to cope the @entity160 has predicted that few areas will be left untouched by the impacts of climate change , which they say will include increasing levels of extreme weather events such as heatwaves and snow storms he added that the study could help to explain the ' pause ' in global warming since 1998 that was reported by the @entity160 last year			1
the new study showed that while warming continued in most parts of the planet , it was offset by a strong cooling during the winter months in the @entity178			0
prof @entity141 said : ' there really has n't been a pause in global warming			0
there has been a pause in @entity178 winter warming			0
' it comes after separate research , published in the journal @entity43 , found that the chances of heatwaves in @entity33 have increased in the past decade			1
the likelihood of @entity192 heatwaves , such as the one in 2003 , have also increased tenfold , from being a one in 1,000 year event to occurring around once in a century			1
by the 2040s , such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise , the researchers at the @entity17 claimed			0
the summer heatwave in 2003 killed thousands of people as temperatures soared far higher than those seen in previous years			0
this map shows the temperature difference in 2003 compared to 2000 , 2001 , 2002 and 2004 temperature data gathered by the @entity205 shows that 2014 has already been the warmest on record for some parts of the world , including much of @entity33			1

@entity5 found heatwaves are becoming more frequent
extremely cold temperatures have also been occurring more often
findings come amid prediction that 2014 is likely to be warmest on record
