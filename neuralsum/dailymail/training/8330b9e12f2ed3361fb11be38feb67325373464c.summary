by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:02 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 9 november 2012 click here to read : strictly speaking , we are looking in the wrong place for racism ' is it any wonder that , in this climate , @entity8 of @entity9 believes he heard a white referee , @entity12 , refer to his black team - mate @entity13 as a ‘ monkey ’ two weeks ago ' @entity15 have issued an impassioned defence of their fans ’ right to use the term ‘ @entity20 ’ in their matchday chants			1
@entity22 , chairman of the @entity23 , described the north @entity26 club ’s attitude as being ‘ 40 years out of date ’ , and said that if such chants continue they would ask the police to bring a prosecution for racism			1
the society claim such chants — either by opposition fans or @entity15 supporters themselves — are anti-semitic and unacceptable in contemporary society			1
as part of a 10 - point plan to tackle racism in football , they are threatening to report to the police any anti-semitic chants heard at @entity44 unless @entity15 and the @entity45 agree to take @entity46 are steeped in @entity48 tradition and large sections of their support refer to themselves as ‘ @entity20 ’ in matchday songs			1
' our guiding principle in respect of the " y - word " is based on the point of law itself - the distinguishing factor is the intent with which it is used ie if it is used with the deliberate intention to cause offence			1
' this has been the basis of prosecutions of fans of other teams to date			0
our fans adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect anti-semitic abuse			1
they do not use the term to others to cause any offence , they use it a chant amongst themselves			2
' the club believes that real anti-semitic abuse such as hissing to simulate the noise of gas chambers is the real evil and the real offence			1
we believe this is the area that requires a determined and concerted effort from all parties and where we seek greater support to eradicate			0
' @entity22 also says that ‘ hissing ’ noises made by away fans at @entity44 — a reference to the gas chambers in the @entity117 — are equally intolerable and will also provoke a complaint from his organisation			2
@entity22 told @entity121 : ' in discussions with members of the @entity48 community , we were made aware that this practice is still continuing and it has to come to an end			0
' if neither @entity15 nor the @entity45 are willing to take a stand then @entity23 will report the matter to the @entity129 for investigation and , if necessary , prosecution			2
' the report will be made if this behaviour does not cease by 20 november			0
we will have monitors in attendance to observe what occurs			0
' but @entity15 hit back with a strong defence of their supporters ’ use of the word ‘ @entity20 ’ , saying in a statement : ‘ the club does not tolerate any form of racist or abusive chanting			1
' our guiding principle in respect of the “ y - word ” is based on the point of law itself — the distinguishing factor is the intent with which it is used , ie. if it is used with the deliberate intention to cause offence			1
' this has been the basis of prosecutions of fans of other teams to date			0
our fans adopted the chant as a defence mechanism in order to own the term and thereby deflect anti-semitic abuse			1
they do not use the term to others to cause any offence , they use it as a chant among themselves			2
‘ the club believes that real anti-semitic abuse such as hissing to simulate the noise of gas chambers is the real evil and the real offence			1
‘ we believe this is the area that requires a determined effort from all parties and where we seek greater support to eradicate			0
’ smiles better : @entity15 's @entity183 @entity182 and @entity184 during a training session @entity22 is a human rights barrister and chairman of the @entity23			2
he ’s also the man who lodged a complaint with the @entity129 over referee @entity12 ’s alleged abuse of @entity190 was the first chair of the @entity192 and , with strong links to the @entity194 , has advised on introducing an equivalent to the @entity196 in @entity197			0
after reading @entity15 ’s statement , @entity22 made a stinging attack on the club , branding the comments ‘ unbelievable ’			1
‘ the argument sounds like it is 40 years old , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m deeply saddened that a football club that represents such a diverse area has taken such a view			2
i do n’t want to have to take my children to a football match and expect to hear anti-semitic chants			2
‘ @entity15 obviously just do n’t get it			2
it ’s almost like saying if a woman refers to another woman in a derogatory fashion then it is ok			0
’ @entity22 added : ‘ what we are trying to do is change a culture			0
what we are saying to @entity15 is , “ maybe this was ok 50 years ago — but it is n’t now ”			2
‘ even if it comes from @entity15 supporters , it remains casual racism			1
we understand it is a difficult , and for some an uncomfortable , stance to take , but we feel it is the right stance			0
’ storm brewing : referee @entity12 is under investigation for his clash with @entity13 high profile : incidents involving @entity231 and @entity232 brought focus on racism in football @entity236 @entity237 @entity22 a minimum six to nine - month ban for racial abuse , rising to a five - year ban for a third offence any fines going directly to @entity243 to fund grassroots anti-racism initiatives the creation of representative associations for black players , managers and coaches guidance for referees to send off players using racist abuse and the power to call off games where the crowd is using such abuse a 20 per cent quota at all levels of the @entity45 , @entity259 , clubs as well as football agents and referees racial abuse to be a matter of gross misconduct incorporated into players ’ contracts clubs to invest in the personal education of all players , including university or college education recording referees and assistants during matches to pick up any possible abuse by players			1
a system for reporting racial incidents to be set up with details of these incidents , both on and off the pitch , published each year former @entity15 stars @entity283 and @entity284 have previously condemned the mimicking of the gas chambers by away supporters			1
@entity15 have traditionally been well supported by members of the @entity48 community			2
many fans do not consider references to their faith as offensive			0
others , such as comedian @entity236 , however , do			2
last year @entity236 launched a campaign , supported by @entity237 , to stamp out use of the word ' yid ' in football chants which mock @entity48 and @entity15 supporters			1
the @entity23 is involved in talks to create a @entity303 ’ association with some professionals , claiming the football authorities are not doing enough to represent them or to tackle racism in the sport			2
the @entity259 recently introduced its own six - point action plan but the society says this will prove ' ineffective '			2
@entity15 supporters will be put under the microscope more than ever during the @entity313 visit of @entity73			1
but @entity15 manager @entity314 is focusing on whether to field a double - pronged strikeforce of @entity64 and @entity182 against the @entity317 champions			1
@entity318 striker @entity64 has been @entity15 ’s @entity319 striker this season , while @entity182 has been forced to spend most of the season on the bench			0
@entity314 said : ‘ we have had thoughts , between the technical staff , about playing them both — about changing our structure			0
‘ we have had success in the past with the system that we are playing			0
we certainly have played 4 - 4 - 2 in some games when @entity331 has come on			0
but whether the right time is tomorrow i am not sure			0
’ as a youngster growing up supporting @entity15 , it took me some time to realise the word ' yid ' was an offensive racial slur			1
i 'd never heard it used in a derogatory sense at @entity44 , only ever as a collective term - yid army - and as a positive identifier			0
if a player was good , he was a yiddo			0
but its significance soon became apparent			0
though far from the abhorrent gas chamber hissing of some away fans , it 's still sensitive			0
context is important , though , and its reclamation as a positive term at the ground should not be ignored			0
the @entity23 lawyers says use of the word yid , including the tone adopted by @entity15 fans , amounts to casual racism			1
perhaps they have a point			0
perhaps simply substituting the word would be the answer			0
but @entity15 fans are unlikely to take kindly at being told what to do by an external body , especially as it is largely considered a positive , rather than offensive , chant			1
@entity236 tried to stamp out its use by @entity15 supporters but , despite his own @entity48 faith , the views of a @entity9 fan were never likely to be accepted by the @entity15 majority			1
if the word yid really is to be kicked out of @entity44 , it would need concerns to be raised from within the @entity15 - supporting community , rather than outside pressures			1
@entity380 , life - long @entity15 supporter			1

@entity15 told to act over anti-semitic songs by anti-racism body

spurs stress ' y - word ' is not used to cause anyone offence
@entity283 and @entity236 back campaign to stop use of the ' y - word '
society of black lawyers reveal *blueprint* to kick racism out of football
