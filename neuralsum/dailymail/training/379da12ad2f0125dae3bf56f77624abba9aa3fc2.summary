by @entity0 @entity3 auto giant @entity2 made false claims about the crash testing of several of its cars , it has emerged			2
@entity7 said all its models boasted five - star ratings in @entity12 tests			1
but its @entity14 sports car , which costs up to £ 100,000 , as well as its @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 models , have in fact never been tested			1
untested : the @entity14 sports car , which costs up to £ 100,000 , has not gone through a @entity12 crash test , despite salesmen claiming it has there is no evidence that the vehicles are inherently unsafe , however the company , which is part of @entity29 , has been accused of misleading drivers			1
the issue came to light when entrepreneur @entity33 was interested in buying an @entity14 for his sports car rental company and was told by the dealer it was safety tested to the highest standards			2
mr @entity33 said : ‘ one of the main reasons for me buying the @entity14 over its competitors was the fact @entity2 advised me it had a @entity12 rating of 5 - star and it had been crash tested			1
’ the @entity12 crash test is not a legally required , but the stringent regime , which looks at how vehicles cope with a range of impacts , is considered the gold standard of motor safety			2
mr @entity33 , 25 , bought the car for a rental business in 2012 and it was subsequently used in a music video featuring the singer @entity55 and separately by the magician @entity56			0
false promises : @entity59 @entity2 salesmen have been claiming that all of the @entity3 auto giant 's models boasted five - star ratings in @entity12 tests ( stock image ) he did not give the safety question another thought until a few months later when his father @entity68 , 54 , was involved in a crash while taking evasive action			1
despite the fact the car was only travelling at only 45 miles per hour it was cut in half after spinning into the air and hitting a tree			0
mr @entity33 ’ father was in a coma for three and half weeks and in hospital for many months			0
the crash , which happened on a road near the family home in @entity84 , @entity85 , prompted him to look into exactly what checks @entity12 had carried out on the car			2
‘ i visited the @entity12 website and became aware that the @entity14 had never been crash tested or put through any programme with @entity12			1
to find out that it was n’t after being advised that it had been , i was extremely upset			0
disappointed , ’ he said			0
he wanted to know whether this was a one - off error and so called 50 other @entity2 dealerships to ask about the @entity14 ’s safety testing , to check if they were issuing the same misleading information			1
‘ forty - eight of them had told me directly that it had been put through the @entity12 programme , that it had been crash tested , and it had a 5 - star rating			1
i was just gobsmacked , ’ he said			0
‘ frankly i am just disgusted that the company could be misleading people in such a serious way			0
’ @entity7 's lies : other models salesmen falsely claimed had undergone the crash tests were @entity16 , @entity17 ( pictured ) and the @entity18 mr @entity33 contacted @entity108 who carried out their own mystery shopping exercise at 10 @entity2 showrooms across the country to establish if staff were in the wrong			1
eight gave misinformation about @entity12 tests			1
@entity116 , of the @entity117 , said : ‘ i find it absolutely incredible to be honest , that a company of the reputation of @entity2 , and their parent group , the @entity121 , can allow their product to be misrepresented so badly in that way			2
‘ nobody ’s saying the cars are n’t safe , but if they have n’t been tested , they have n’t been tested			0
to say they have … that ’s outrageous			0
’ mr @entity33 first contacted @entity2 @entity59 head office to alert them to the problem five months ago , however , @entity108 found its customer service staff are still giving out misinformation			2
@entity2 has accepted staff were in the wrong and apologised			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity2 @entity59 wishes to emphasise that there has not been any deliberate intent to mislead on the part of its customer - facing staff where the @entity12 safety test performance of the @entity2 model range is concerned			1
‘ significant and sustained investment in active and passive safety technology across the @entity2 range has resulted in safety standards that do not call for embellishment or exaggeration by our customer - facing teams			2
‘ @entity2 vehicles are engineered to exceed international motor vehicle safety standards			0
the company fully supports @entity12 ’s efforts to improve vehicle safety			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ @entity2 @entity59 accepts that this investigation has brought to light a shortfall in its communication procedures where the @entity12 safety ratings of its range are concerned			1
we also acknowledge that we did not adequately address this shortfall when it was brought to our attention by mr @entity33 , and on both counts we apologise unreservedly			0

@entity59 @entity2 salesmen claimed models had gone through crash tests
dealers told customers all models had five - star ratings in @entity12
however no tests have been performed on @entity14 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 models
