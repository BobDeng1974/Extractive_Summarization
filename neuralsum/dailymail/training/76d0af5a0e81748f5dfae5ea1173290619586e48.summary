scientists have produced the first cloned dog in @entity2 after its owner won a competition to have her elderly pet replicated			1
@entity6 , 29 , from west @entity7 , put her elderly dachshund , @entity9 , forward to be cloned in a £ 60,000 competition organised by @entity12 tech firm , @entity11			1
she won , and the cloned puppy , called @entity14 , was conceived in a test tube and born in @entity16 on 30 march			1
dogs that have similar ovulation time are selected as egg donors and surrogate mothers			0
eggs are collected from the egg donor through a procedure called ‘ flushing ’ and the nuclei of the eggs , which contain dna of the egg donor , is removed			0
then donor cell is then injected into the nucleated egg and the two cells are ‘ fused ’ together			0
this fusion procedure produces a cloned embryo that is transferred into a surrogate dog			1
the whole process takes less than a day but comes with a hefty price tag , at around $ 100,000 or £ 63,000 to clone one dog			2
@entity11 has cloned highly trained rescue and police dogs for the @entity12 government , as well as a number of highly prized pets in the @entity63 the process was filmed by a television company and will be aired tonight			2
the first mammal to be cloned was @entity66 the sheep , born in @entity68 in 1996			1
dogs were first cloned in @entity12 in 2005 , by @entity11 scientist dr @entity70 , but this is the first time a @entity2 dog has been reproduced			1
miss @entity6 , a caterer , said she read about the cloning competition and entered her 12 - year - old dachshund , sending in videos of her pet			1
she said : ' my sausage dog is very special but she is 12 and not going to be around for ever			2
' @entity9 made it onto a shortlist of three , and after she won , a sample of her skin tissue was removed , and sent to @entity12 in liquid nitrogen			1
there , the cells were put into eggs provided by a bitch of the same breed , before a spark of electricity fused the two			2
the embryo was then put into a donor animal , and the resulting puppy was born by caesarean section , weighing just over 1lb , ten days ago			1
miss @entity6 , who flew to @entity16 and watched the puppy being born , said it looked just like her own pet			1
@entity2 quarantine restrictions mean she now has to wait six months before she can bring the puppy home to meet the original @entity9			1
how it 's done : eggs are collected from the egg donor through a procedure called ' flushing '			0
the donor cell is then injected into the nucleated egg and the two cells are ' fused ' together			0
this fusion procedure produces a cloned embryo that is transferred into a surrogate dog the puppy was cloned from a cell provided by @entity6 's dachshund in west @entity7 miss @entity6 , the brand new puppy , and one of the scientists from @entity11 that cloned it the puppy is still too small to see or hear but @entity119 , 29 , says it is identical to her own pet , @entity9 miss @entity6 , seen meeting the tiny puppy soon after it was born by caesarean section in a @entity16 lab original : winnie the dachshund is credited by her owner with helping her overcome an eating disorder @entity12 scientist , @entity70 cloned the first dog ever , afghan hound @entity131 , in 2005 the dog 's owner , who credits @entity9 with helping her overcome the bulimia she suffered as a teenager , told the mirror : ' personality-wise , i could n't tell you [ if it is identical to @entity9 ] , because it does n't see and it does n't hear yet - it is just a little sausage dog that wriggles around drinking milk			1
' the @entity12 firm , which produced the world 's first cloned dog , @entity131 , and has also cloned highly trained rescue and police dogs for the @entity12 government , now hopes other @entity2 will want to pay £ 60,000 to have their pets cloned			1
cloning expert @entity151 said that the dog cloning industry was based in @entity12 because it has much lower ethical standards for the treatment of dogs than in @entity156 or the @entity63			1
he said that some of the dogs used in the cloning process as egg donors or surrogate mothers were often killed and eaten afterwards			0
and one of the @entity2 scientists responsible for cloning dolly the sheep said he was sceptical about the benefits of cloning dogs			1
sir @entity168 told the @entity169 : ‘ owners will be disappointed			0
so much of the personality of a dog comes from the way you treat them			0
if you spend £ 60,000 on a cloned dog you will treat it differently			1
’ in 1979 , researchers produced the first genetically identical mice by splitting mouse embryos and then implanting the resulting embryos in female mice			0
not long after , researchers produced the first genetically identical cows , chickens and sheep by moving the nucleus of a cell taken from an early embryo into an egg that had its nucleus removed			2
but it was n’t until 1996 , that researchers were able to clone the first mammal from a mature cell taken from an adult animal			2
after 276 attempts , @entity198 researchers produced @entity66 , the lamb from the udder cell of a six - year - old sheep			1
two years later , researchers in @entity204 cloned eight calves from a single cow , but only four survived			0
besides cattle and sheep , other mammals that have been cloned from somatic cells include : cat , deer , dog , horse , mule , ox , rabbit and rat			2
in addition , a rhesus monkey has been cloned by embryo splitting			2
in 2008 , scientists were able to create clones of a mouse that had been dead and frozen for 16 years			0
it was the first time they have been able to clone a frozen animal			0
a cat called @entity229 earned the title as the first commercially cloned pet in 2004 when a woman in @entity233 paid $ 50,000 ( £ 30,000 ) for the service			2
dr @entity70 , the chief technical officer at @entity11 , pioneered the dog cloning technique in 2005			2
his group is currently the only company in the world that offers dog cloning @entity239 far , @entity11 has carried out around 400 cloning procedures with big interest in the @entity242 and @entity63			0
but a spokesman for animal rights organisation @entity244 said : ‘ it ’s understandable that people fantasise about replicating an adored dog but cloning can only replicate genetic material			0
‘ cloned animals will develop different personalities			0
we can not resurrect animals , but we can give living animals in desperate need a chance at a happy life			0
every year , millions of homeless animals are euthanised			0
’ scientists in @entity198 were the first in the world to clone an adult mammal , resulting in the birth of @entity66 the sheep at the @entity264 in @entity265 in 1996			1
while there had been previous clonings from embryo cells , @entity66 was the first successful cloning of an adult mammal			1
scientists took dna from a single sheep cell and injected it into an egg , which was implanted into a surrogate mother			0
@entity66 , who had three mothers ( one who provided the dna , another who provided the egg , and a third who was the surrogate ) , was born on 5 july at the institute , in what was hailed the breakthrough of the year by @entity283			1
one of the @entity2 creators of @entity66 the sheep ( pictured ) , who became the world 's first cloned mammal in 1996 , has said he was sceptical of the benefits of cloning dogs @entity66 lived her entire life at the institute , where she was bred with a @entity295 lamb and produced six lambs			1
she was put down aged six in 2003 after suffering from a progressive lung disease			0
sheep usually live to 11 or 12 , and there was speculation that her premature death may have been caused by her having been cloned			2
after @entity66 was cloned , many other large animals including horses , bulls , pigs and deer were cloned			1
now , despite advances in the cloning process , animal welfare groups say the risks , including deformities , are still too high			0
and others critcise the methods used by scientists			0
dr @entity315 , head of science at the @entity317 , said : ‘ each clone is the result of a process that causes great harm and suffering to a large number of animals			0

the first @entity2 dog to be cloned was born in @entity16 , @entity12 , on 30 march
it was created with dna taken from a 12 - year - old dachshund , @entity9
@entity9 's owner , @entity6 , 29 , won a competition to have pet cloned
the caterer from west @entity7 put her dog forward to win £ 60,000 prize
@entity328 was taken from @entity9 , sent to @entity16 and fused into an embryo
miss @entity6 says the 10 - day - old puppy looks identical to her pet
but a cloning expert says the animals wo n't *necessarily* be the same
first mammal cloned from adult was @entity66 the sheep in @entity198 in 1996
