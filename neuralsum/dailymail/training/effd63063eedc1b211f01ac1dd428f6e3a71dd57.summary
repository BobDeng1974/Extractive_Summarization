by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has backed @entity3 to succeed this season despite selling @entity5 , having already proved that they can win without the mercurial @entity7 striker			1
after banking £ 75million from @entity5 ’s move to @entity9 , @entity3 have strengthened by spending close to £ 90m on @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity13			1
they are still in the market for another striker after @entity20 ’s move to @entity21 from @entity22 collapsed , and remain in talks to sign @entity25 defenders @entity26 and @entity27 from @entity28 and @entity29			1
however , they won six of the matches and only lost once , and @entity2 believes they can compensate for the loss of a striker who scored 31 goals last season			1
‘ it gets overlooked that we played the first six games of last season without @entity5 and made a fantastic start so we can clearly win without him , ’ said the @entity50 defender			1
‘ any team that loses a player like @entity5 is going to feel it			1
but we will carry on the way we do , creating chances			1
i think we were the team who created the most chances last season			2
we ’ve signed some good strikers and i ’m sure once they get a chance they will take it			1
’ happy on their travels : @entity30 ' @entity67 are currently away in @entity68 on a pre-season tour big year ahead ! @entity30 says his @entity3 side must win a trophy to be considered a success @entity73 relishing @entity74 on the lookout : @entity3 are still hunting for a new striker after @entity20 's move from @entity22 collapsed @entity3 fell agonisingly short in the title race , losing out to @entity79 on the last day of the season			1
the demands of @entity74 football will make it even harder this time , and they also face @entity79 , @entity84 and @entity85 in the opening six games			2
but @entity2 has seen enough on the club ’s pre-season tour of the @entity68 to be believe they will be challengers again			2
he added : ‘ i think as long as we play the way we did and fight the way we did last season then i ’m sure we ’ll be happy , but it ’s a results game and we want to fight for the title as much as the fans want us to be			2
‘ we were definitely fresher for not playing @entity98 last season			0
and the size of the squad we had last season we probably could not have coped with all the extra games			0
it was probably an advantage last year			0
we ’re going to have a lot more games this season but hopefully we can keep everyone fit and keep fighting			0
‘ if you want to win the @entity74 , the start of every season is important whoever you play			0
at the end of the day , whoever you play you are fighting for three points			0
but we ’ve got some big teams early on			0
sometimes that can be a good thing , sometimes a bad thing			0
‘ we ’ve been preparing regardless of who we are playing at the start of the season			0
hopefully we will win those games , give us a good start and damage our rivals			0
