by @entity0 published : 22:50 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 00:35 est , 3 february 2014 the @entity3 soared into the @entity4 riding the @entity6 's best offense on the arm of future @entity9 quarterback @entity8 and limped away a 43 - 8 loser			1
@entity8 came into the big game as good as ever after setting regular season records for touchdowns ( 55 ) and passing yards ( 5,477 ) but failed to live up to mile high expectations in what was expected to be the signature moment of his career , the @entity22 league - best defense intercepted the future hall of famer twice en route to blocking his bid to tie brother @entity27 with two championships			1
alone in a sea of thousands : @entity8 appeared disconnected and out of sync almost the whole game ineffective : manning # 18 , shown throwing an interception , has been unable to establish a rhythm early on intercepted ! : strong safety @entity35 # 31 of the @entity22 intercepts a pass from @entity8 @entity8 was the story of the week , all eyes were on him - especially in brother @entity27 's home stadium - and he came out flat and only got worse as the game went on			1
@entity42 brought an unrelenting pass rush and swarming coverages that kept @entity8 's internal clock from ever developing a normal rhythm despite him completing a @entity4 - record 33 passes			1
' they havenâ € ™ t played a defense that flies around like we do , that hits like we do , and we just do it every single play , ' said linebacker @entity53			0
' we figured that the longer and longer the game went , they were going to fall eventually			0
' @entity8 never had a chance			2
@entity42 coach @entity58 's defense knocked the @entity3 all over the field and intercepted @entity8 twice in the first half , with @entity62 linebacker @entity61 returning a pick 69 yards for a touchdown			1
trouble from the start : a bad snap sent the ball flying over @entity8 's head during the @entity3 ' first offensive play of the game feb 2 , 2014 ; @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ; @entity3 running back @entity74 ( 27 ) recovers a fumble in the end zone for a safety that gave @entity42 a 2 - 0 lead the five - time mvp overthrew receivers all night , threw wobbly passes and rarely had time to scan the field as @entity42 's unrelenting pass rush constantly kept him under pressure			1
' give @entity42 a lot of credit , they are an excellent football team and they caused a lot of our mistakes , ' @entity8 said			2
his troubles started when a loud crowd led to a high snap that sailed over his head and resulted in a safety that gave @entity42 an early 2 - 0 lead and the ball			1
his first interception led to @entity42 's second field goal , the hole began to grow , but no one thought @entity8 would be unable to bring the @entity3 back			1
on the money : @entity22 kicker @entity103 ( 4 ) kicks a 31 yard field goal during the first half of the @entity4 helpless : @entity8 watches action against the @entity22 from the bench during the second half @entity3 's next drive ended when @entity22 safety @entity35 intercepted an errant @entity8 throw that resulted in @entity42 's first touchdown a few plays later when running back @entity113 took a one yard hand off in for the score only a few minutes into the second quarter			1
the score was quickly 15 - 0 , @entity8 was in a manageable hole until the wheels finally came off			2
he began the @entity3 next possession by completing 7 of 9 passes for 47 yards and finally started to resemble the quarterback who won his fifth mvp award this season			2
the sixth pass was a death knell , it fluttered through the air and was picked off by @entity62 linebacker @entity129 - he returned it 69 yards for a touchdown			2
never comfortable : manning pauses during the second half of the @entity4 pick six ! : @entity22 ' @entity61 ( 53 ) intercepts a pass intended for @entity3 ' @entity74 ( 27 ) , which was returned 69 yards for a touchdown the wobbling pass resembled the ducks that @entity42 cornerback @entity137 said the 17 - year veteran throws at this stage of his career			1
' we needed to play really well in order to win , and we didnâ € ™ t come anywhere close to that , ' said @entity8			0
@entity8 's dismal first half was punctuated by another duck thrown on 4th and two with 1:01 left , it barely missed being intercepted			1
he finished the first half 17 of 23 for 104 yards and was shown walking off the field with his tail between his legs before time even expired in the second quarter - one that is likely to haunt him for many years			0
end of the road : @entity8 walks off the field after the @entity3 lost to the @entity22 in @entity155 the nightmare only continued in the second when @entity3 kick @entity157 went for hang time on the opening kick as he tried to give his coverage team enough time to get to the dangerous @entity163			1
@entity163 's return put @entity8 and the @entity3 in a 29 - 0 hole they never recovered from			1
the sure - fire hall of famer overthrew several receivers in the second half and looked nothing like the @entity8 who led the @entity3 to 13 regular season wins in 2013			2
@entity8 was able to put together a @entity4 - record 34 completions , but the historic mark rang hollow as he failed to earn his second championship			0
he completed a record 13 receptions to receiver @entity176 , including his lone touchdown , but it was too little too late			0
the former @entity179 fell to 1 - 2 in the big game			0
the @entity22 defense added insult to injury late in the fourth quarter when the ball was knocked out of his hands for a fumble in what amounted to garbage time			2
dejected : @entity8 walks off the field after not converting on fourth down during the fourth quarter @entity8 finished 34 of 49 for 280 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions - good for a 73.5 rating			1
it may have been the last game he plays in the @entity6 , and it was one of the worst performances he ever turned in			0
' to finish this way is very disappointing , ' @entity8 admitted			0
' it 's a bitter pill to swallow			0
' the all - pro quarterback has stated he wants to return next year , but can not do so until given clearance by doctors that will check his surgically repaired neck in the next few months			0
@entity8 had n't missed a start in his first 12 season in the league until a severe neck injury cost him the entire 2011 season and saw him released by the @entity179 - the team that drafted him			0
his career was feared over then , he came back a vengeance			0
he might not come back this time .			0

the game 's first score came after a snap sailed over @entity8 's head and into the end zone for a safety
the @entity22 ' legion of boom ' defense picked manning off twice , returning one for a touchdown
the @entity3 did not convert a third down until the second quarter
@entity8 's only touchdown pass was a *meaningless* toss in the 4th quarter when the game was already out of reach
