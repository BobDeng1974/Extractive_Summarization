by @entity0 the design of airplane cabins has come a long way since the early days of commercial flying , but there 's still plenty of room for improvement , as anyone who ’s battled for elbow room or carry - on luggage space knows			0
so make way for a plane whose design draws more on the interiors of hotel rooms and luxury bathrooms than the trusty 747			0
the @entity21 aeroplane has tablet holders on headrests in place of the usual mini screens , touchless taps in the toilets , and a whole lot more personal space			1
@entity21 , for the @entity48 aerospace conglomerate @entity47 , attempts to fix many of the problems of existing cabins , from cramped seating and bathrooms to too - small luggage holds and excessive fuel consumption			1
the new design could be used by @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59 , which are all clients of @entity47			0
the company says its aim is to increase space and efficiency , both for passengers ’ comfort , and for ecological and economic reasons			2
note the ' slimmer ' seats and large screens for first class passengers it 's a toilet , but not as we know it : a ' touchless faucet ' and check out the size of the jumbo loo roll ' your very own @entity76 ' : that 's light and air control if you did n't know luxury seating : if you like the look of the new seats , wait until you see the bathroom same on the outside			1
. different on the inside : the @entity21 planes will be launched in 2018 the new planes will even have an ' acoustic curtain ' around the toilet ... in case the sounds from within threaten to encroach on nearby passengers , and a better baby - changing space for parents			1
' there 's a constant drive in aviation to develop more eco-friendly designs , not just in terms of the materials used , but in improving fuel consumption , explains @entity106 , designer and co-founding director of the company			2
the company has accordingly reduced the overall weight of the plane by ' slimming down ' seating , to create a plane that uses less fuel and frees up more space in the cabin for passengers			1
to reduce the impact of the proximity of fellow passengers - the design includes redesigned , individual @entity123 ( psus ) - the air and light control unit above the seats - to allow each passenger to control the light and air overhead without disturbing their neighbour			2
sleek lines : smart black uphostery with a touch of citrus ... and comfy headrest not your average budget airline : the amount of space has been carefully measure to improve passengers ' airborne experience ' say , for instance , the passenger next to you wanted to turn their reading light on or off , they would need to encroach on your personal space to do so			1
the redesign addresses that problem , ' says @entity106			0
competing with fellow passengers to cram your overstuffed carry - on into the overhead luggage hold could also become a thing of the past , with 40 per cent larger capacity compartments			0
the new design does away with much of the material that was unnecessary in current plane cabins , making for a lighter and roomier interior			0
as the company describes it , ' less passive aggression between you and all those annoying fellow passengers who keep getting in your space '			0
the @entity21 jets will start flying in 2018 .			2

the ' @entity21 ' has been designed to improve passengers ' airborne experiences
has wider yet slimmer seating , personal tablet screen and touchless taps
lighter aeroplanes mean less fuel too , say designers
