@entity1 and @entity2 leaders tussled monday afternoon after @entity2 's @entity3 , ayatollah @entity4 , said he rejected overtures from the @entity1 to join its coalition aligned against the self - proclaimed @entity8 ( @entity8 )			1
' the @entity1 ambassador in @entity10 asked our ambassador [ in @entity10 ] for a session to discuss coordinating a fight against @entity15 , ' @entity4 said , referring to @entity8 by an alternate name in quotes carried by the state - controlled news service @entity20			1
' our ambassador in @entity10 reflected this to us , which was welcomed by some [ @entity2 ] officials , but i was opposed			0
i saw no point in cooperating with a country whose hands are dirty and intentions murky			0
' @entity2 has also claimed @entity1 secretary of state @entity31 asked @entity2 foreign minister @entity32 if his country would join the @entity37 administration 's @entity35 coalition			1
in two press briefings hours later , @entity37 administration officials tried to swat the accusation away as they struggled to maintain that the @entity1 has never intended to work with @entity2 in any way			1
' a reporter asked @entity56 to confirm that ' there has been no request from the @entity1 for cooperation of any kind with the @entity2 in this battle ' against @entity8			1
@entity56 fell back on a policy statement			0
' our posture , ' he said , ' is that we are not going to coordinate our military actions or our intelligence sharing activities with the @entity2			1
' citing a ' shared interest ' of both @entity2 and the @entity1 in defeating @entity8 , he acknowledged that ' there will continue to be back - channel communications – back - channel conversation – on this topic between the @entity1 , and other members of the international community , and the @entity2			2
' but despite ' @entity2 's significant military capability , and given their significant interest in the outcome ' as @entity8 mows through territory in neighboring @entity10 , he insisted that the @entity37 administration is not ' going to coordinate with @entity2			1
' @entity56 added that are no plans for president @entity37 and his @entity2 counterpart , @entity95 , to talk when they are both in @entity97 for a @entity99 meeting in two weeks			0
a few blocks away and an hour later at the @entity102 's headquarters , deputy spokeswoman @entity100 framed her initial response as a hypothetical			2
' i 'm not confirming one way or the other any reports of contact ' between the two nations , she said			1
' we are not going to cooperate ' with @entity2 , @entity100 added , ' so obviously that would follow that we have n't asked them to			1
' one reporter pressed her for a more definitive denial			0
' any contact you have had , or may have in the future , will not be an " ask " of @entity2 ? ' he clarified ? ' correct , ' @entity100 said			2
' but then , speaking only in the present tense , she said : ' we 're certainly not discussing coordinating with them			0
' @entity2 's military could be a fearsome weapon against @entity8 , and @entity2 shares a common interest with the @entity1 since @entity10 is on its western border ' we are not going to cooperate ' with @entity2 , @entity102 deputy spokeswoman @entity100 said vaguely , ' so obviously that would follow that we have n't asked them to ' @entity102 chief spokeswoman @entity127 tweeted on monday that the @entity1 ' will not coordinate militarily with @entity2 , ' but was silent on the question of whether the @entity37 administration had ask the @entity8 republic to help @entity102 chief spokeswoman @entity127 refused comment to @entity133 about whether any approach was made			1
earlier in the day , she tweeted a version of @entity100 's talking points , writing that ' we are not and will not coordinate militarily with @entity2			2
' their boss , secretary of state @entity31 , was in @entity140 on monday for an international diplomatic conference aimed at resolving how to hamstring @entity8 , which now controls more than one - third of the combined territories of @entity10 and @entity143			0
a joint statement issued afterward described a collective aim of defeating @entity8 and supporting @entity10 ' by any means necessary , including appropriate military assistance			0
' representatives from @entity2 were not invited			0
@entity31 , like the @entity57 , was noncommittal but seemed intent on not slamming any doors in @entity95 's face			2
' i have no idea of what interpretation they drew from any discussion that may or may not have taken place , ' @entity31 told @entity156			0
' we are not coordinating with @entity2			0
' @entity4 insisted monday that he ' rejected ' entreaties from secretary of state @entity31 and from @entity1 ambassador to @entity10 @entity161 angry : @entity2 's supreme leader , a religious cleric , accused the @entity1 -- not @entity8 -- of fomenting terrorism but in his next breath he said he was not ' opposed to the idea of communicating to find out if they will come on board or under what circumstances or whether there is the possibility of a change			1
' ' having a channel of communication on one of the biggest issues in the world today , ' @entity31 said , ' is common sense			0
' @entity4 , @entity2 's 75 - year - old religious patriarch , appeared less enthusiastic			1
he had claimed earlier in the day , following his release from a hospital where he had what his government called a routine procedure on his prostate , that ' we are proud that the @entity1 has become disappointed at @entity2 not having a part in a collective wrongdoing			2
' ' we do not work with the @entity1 , as they have evil intentions and stained hands , ' he said			0
' how is it possible to cooperate with @entity1 under such circumstances ? ' now they are lying , ' @entity4 charged , ' in saying that it is them who excluded us from their coalition , while it was @entity2 that refused to participate in this coalition to begin with			1
' he claimed the @entity37 administration wanted to regain in @entity10 what it once had in @entity201 , ' a playground where they can enter freely and bomb at will			0

@entity2 supreme leader ayatollah @entity4 said he rejected overtures from the @entity1 to join its *anti-isis* coalition
@entity57 is cagey , saying only that it 's ' our posture ' to never coordinate military or intelligence operations with @entity65
@entity102 spokeswoman tells reporters : ' we are not going to cooperate , so obviously that would follow that we have n't asked them to '
but she adds that ' i 'm not confirming one way or the other any reports of contact ' between the two nations
@entity4 insists : ' they are lying , in saying that it is them who excluded us from their coalition , while it was @entity2 that refused to participate in this collation to begin with
