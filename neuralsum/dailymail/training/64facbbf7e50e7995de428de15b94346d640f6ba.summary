@entity0 can be found burrowing happily around the corridors of a stand built with the proceeds of @entity5 ’s single season with the high rollers in the @entity7			1
the previous evening had been spent in @entity8 watching @entity9 beat @entity10 in an epic @entity12 penalty shootout			1
the morning had been spent in the squall on the training pitches , beside the academy , behind @entity17 ’s @entity16 , all funded as part of the £ 4.5million development which transformed one end of the ground and provides a legacy from one year in the top tier			1
@entity0 is preparing to take charge of his 1,000th league game during a second spell with @entity5 the @entity30 manager 's career has seen him in charge of clubs including @entity33 and wednesday @entity0 has experienced the full range of emotions from @entity17 supporters it was @entity0 who led @entity5 to promotion in 1996 - 97 to the soundtrack of delirious supporters who sang : ‘ it ’s just like watching @entity43			1
’ it was his first managerial role and much has happened since but it feels like the perfect place to celebrate 1,000 games as a boss			1
‘ coming here from @entity50 ( where he played ) , i was n’t embraced by everybody , ’ he recalled			1
‘ there were tough times			1
they had to close three sides of the ground to put in seats and crowds were down to four or five thousand at times			1
‘ we were 1 - 0 down at @entity60 in an @entity12 - tie with a few minutes to go and defending a corner in front of our own fans and they ’re venting their frustration at me			1
‘ they were chipping bits of stone off the top of a wall and pelting me with it			1
then we broke from that corner and equalised			1
within a minute , @entity71 got the winner			2
’ @entity0 is congratulated by his players after winning promotion with @entity5 in 1996 - 97 a @entity5 fan plants a kiss on the manager after securing promotion to the @entity7 @entity0 took @entity5 to the top division for the first time in their 125 - year history @entity0 poses with sir @entity81 after winning the @entity82 in 1997 by the time he returned to @entity5 for a second spell , this time last year , @entity0 had adapted to the wild oscillations of managerial life			1
he went from being stoned to being feted and then hated again when he left to take over back at wednesday			2
and so the wheel of fortune turns			2
‘ you need a mental toughness , ’ he said			2
‘ you need to be resilient			2
if you ’re up and down on every decision or opinion , you wo n’t last			2
‘ people say , “ oh , nice @entity93 ” , but they would n’t say that if things were going wrong and i was in their faces in the week			2
you have to have that ruthlessness			2
that ’s what keeps you going			2
‘ my ambition has never diminished			2
i still believe i can coach in the @entity7			1
i ’ve always believed that			2
i want to be at the top			2
but opportunities up there are rare for @entity106 coaches from the lower leagues			2
maybe we ’re just not sexy enough			2
that must be it , because we have the ability and the knowledge			0
it ’s one thing i ’d like to see change			0
‘ the way i feel at the moment , i could carry on for the next 10 years			0
i ’m 55 in january			0
i feel fit as anything but that decision is always in other people ’s hands , is n’t it ? ’ @entity0 ( left ) spent three seasons as a player at @entity50 , one of nine clubs he played for the @entity5 manager wipes a tear from his eye as the @entity30 are relegated after one season in the top flight @entity0 returned to the @entity129 as manager after leaving @entity5 for the first time more than a steely determination , disguised by a friendly nature , he dedicates his landmark to the support of his wife @entity136 and children @entity138 and @entity139 through a career spanning 37 years since joining @entity141 as a teenager from @entity143 , then a non-league club			1
he has worked almost without interruption through the opinion boom , when managers pray for a year in the job and chairmen are pressurised by vocal minorities on radio phone - ins and social media			0
‘ we must have lived in 16 different houses in all corners of the country but @entity136 has never complained			0
without that i ’d have thought twice , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you need support , not only from your family but also those you work with			0
when you are asked for influences , you are expected to pick out a well - known manager who took you under his wing , but i ’ve been influenced more by those who have always been close to listen or offer advice			0
they know who they are			0
’ as a player he skipped through nine clubs , winning the @entity172 twice and 24 caps for @entity174			1
in that time some big names left a mark			0
‘ there is one thing i ’ve always remembered , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ when i played for @entity179 , he ’d say , “ when i sit in that stand i want to be entertained			0
i do n’t want to go home after 90 minutes thinking , what was the hell was that ? ” ‘ we ’re entertainers			0
that ’s our duty and that ’s what we try to do			0
‘ we want to win — if you do n’t it will cost you your job — but if you ’re grinding one - nils out every week and you ’re s * * * e , that does n’t give me any satisfaction			0
there has to be enjoyment for the fans			0
’ @entity5 players celebrate after beating @entity199 3 - 0 to set up a @entity12 tie with @entity201 @entity0 has listened to @entity179 's advice that entertainment is as important as winning he recalled the ‘ fantastic enthusiasm ’ of @entity209 , his manager at @entity210 , and few people work with @entity205 without taking something from the experience			1
this is the @entity212 ’s official 1,000 club list : @entity213 , @entity179 , @entity214 , @entity215 , sir @entity216 , @entity205 , @entity217 , sir @entity81 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , sir @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232			1
@entity0 , who joined @entity233 for £ 150,000 in 1983 , said : ‘ @entity234 were desperate for £ 70,000 , so @entity205 asked on the quiet if any of the excess money would go on the team			1
when he found out it would n’t , he threw a couple of players into the deal : @entity240 and @entity241			0
that ’s how he was			0
‘ i had only a short spell with him but i ’m very proud that he thought i could contribute to his team			1
i could n’t take my eyes off him			0
when he spoke , you listened to every word and took it on board			0
“ hello , well done ” , and that was me sky - high for a week			0
‘ you want to be successful , of course			0
there have been times when i ’ve won promotions and it ’s great to find players and see them develop like @entity259 ( @entity260 striker signed by @entity0 at @entity261 ) but that ’s not always what comes to mind when you reflect			1
it ’s your connections with different clubs and their fans , and people you meet and work with			1
‘ there ’s not one club i regret going to			1
@entity272 were playing in the hockey stadium and it was the worst ground i ’ve ever been to			1
there was no atmosphere , hardly any fans , but @entity279 ’s dream was there			0
no money , just a dream			0
‘ irrespective of whether you think it ’s right or wrong , it ’s one of the best things that ’s happened to @entity286			0
’ @entity5 will face @entity289 opponents @entity287 in @entity0 's 1,000th game as a manager @entity0 ’s return to @entity5 was met with mixed feelings			1
he was unable to prevent relegation in may and consistency has eluded them as they approach saturday 's @entity299 fixture against @entity287			1
‘ you ca n’t always go out in the public domain and say , “ if we finish fifth bottom we ’ll be all right ” , ’ he said			0
‘ what does that give the fans to look forward to ? you have to be as bullish as you can but realistically , in the next two or three years , we ’d like to be in the championship again			0
‘ whether i ’m part of it , i do n’t know			0
i ’d never look that far forward			0
are they capable of doing it ? yes , but maybe not this season , although this league is tight			0
‘ if we get there , can we sustain it and stay up ? yes , i think we would because we have an owner who would back us , but everything is more realistic at this club than it has been			1

@entity0 will take charge of 1,000th game during his second spell with @entity299 club @entity5
former player has previously managed at clubs including @entity50 , @entity272 and @entity327
@entity0 won promotion to the @entity7 with the @entity30 in 1997 but has also struggled through tough times at @entity17
