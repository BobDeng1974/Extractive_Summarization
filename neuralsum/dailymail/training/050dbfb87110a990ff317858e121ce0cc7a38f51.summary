he uses it in his act and i think speculation can be stopped now , it is absolute rubbish really			1

however , mr @entity89 added : ' @entity64 does n't seem to recognise any limits anymore			2
' from one comment to the next , as he has shown in several television shows , he attacks the memory of @entity93 victims in an obvious and unacceptable way			0
