@entity1 had hoped that an appeal - backed by a national charity might sway managers to allow her drug that can save her sight from a rare disease			1
but @entity17 confirmed its initial decision to deny the 44 - year - old the medication			1
the treatment for her rare degenerative eye condition would involve several injections which can cost up to £ 800 each			1
she now fears having to give up her job and driving - and that her family may even be forced to sell its house to fund private treatment			1
the secretary , from @entity31 , @entity32 , said : ' i ’m upset and want to cry			1
' i just feel all hope has gone.the health chiefs are heartless			1
' they ’ve got a job to do and i ’m only a name on a piece of paper as far as they are concerned			2
' they ’ve sentenced me to blindness and shortened the quality of my life but just do n’t care			2
' if they put themselves in my situation then maybe they would be more understanding			2
' treatment : lucentis injections proved effective in treating @entity54 sight problems in trials a spokesman for the @entity57 said : ' the @entity59 ’s decision to once again refuse to fund @entity61 ’s treatment and save her remaining sight will have a devastating impact on her life			2
' the refusal to fund an effective and proven treatment is a cruel decision that is likely to mean @entity61 has to stop working			2
' there will be a massive impact on her quality of life and a biglong term cost to the taxpayer			0
we strongly urge the @entity59 to rethink itsdecision			0
' if there ’s an approved treatment available which will save a person’ssight then it should be given to the patient			0
it ’s vital that peoplediagnosed with sight threatening conditions have the opportunity toreceive proven and timely treatments			0
' the @entity59 has denied funding to treat mrs @entity88 ( @entity54 ) , a hereditary condition in which the elastic fibres that normally occur in the skin , eyes and cardiovascular system become calcified			1
local primary care trusts will be stopped from blacklisting drugs approved by the @entity12 drug rationing watchdog from april 2013 , according to the @entity99			0
@entity12 chief executive sir @entity100 has written to the leaders of the @entity102 and @entity103 telling them to start removing drugs from local blacklists that have been approved by the @entity105			0
sir @entity100 said once @entity105 has given approval ' there should be no further barriers ' for the medicines			0
it follows a number of complaints about post-code lotteries where care has been available in some counties but not in others			0
although diagnosed with the condition when she was 21 , it has given her increasing cause for concern in the past 12 months and she has now lost vision in her left eye and is having trouble with her right			0
desperate for help , mrs @entity1 , supported by a consultant at the @entity130 , made an initial funding bid to the @entity59 which was turned down			1
the @entity59 has since reviewed her case after receiving new information from the @entity134 but has again thrown it out , confirming her case was not exceptional enough			0
with evidence suggesting @entity54 patients elsewhere in @entity138 are receiving treatment , mrs @entity1 appears to be the victim of a ‘ postcode lottery ’			1
mrs @entity1 has asked @entity142 mp @entity142 for help and plans to consult an @entity57 solicitor and the @entity145			1
' i have to try and remain strong and hopeful and fight it , ' she said			0
' i am going to do everything i can to save my sight			0

@entity151 have turned down mrs @entity1 ' appeal
' i feel all hope is gone . the health chiefs are heartless '
