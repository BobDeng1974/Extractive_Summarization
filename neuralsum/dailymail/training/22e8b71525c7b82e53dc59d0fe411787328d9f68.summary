@entity0 will not stockpile young players just to send them out loan like @entity3 , claims technical director @entity4			1
@entity3 have sent 30 players out on loan this season and last season allowed big - name young players such as @entity11 and @entity12 to leave @entity13 to gain first team football before eventually selling them			1
earlier this month they had also hoped to sign 23 - year - old @entity15 from @entity16 and then loan him to @entity17 before the deal fell through and the @entity19 signed for @entity21 's side instead			1
@entity15 ( left ) was wanted by @entity3 before he joined @entity17 @entity11 is now at @entity22 having played for them on loan from @entity3 last season @entity12 ( left ) is another former @entity3 player who has since moved on from @entity13 such a policy has seen @entity27 's side criticised and @entity4 insists @entity0 - who have three promising players , @entity31 - @entity30 , @entity32 and @entity33 , on loan - do not operate in the same way			1
' sending players out on loan is not part of our philosophy			1
it 's a decision we make case by case , ' he told @entity44			0
' we always make a well - considered decision what 's best for a certain young player in his situation			1
' for example , a temporary spell with @entity50 is a great solution for @entity53 but there 's no policy or clear philosophy behind it like at @entity3			1
@entity53 has been loaned by @entity0 to @entity50 1			1
