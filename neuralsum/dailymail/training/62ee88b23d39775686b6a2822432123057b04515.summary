by @entity0 his first outing on @entity3 ’s glistening new track could hardly have gone better , but @entity4 still was n’t completely happy with his performance			1
‘ i ca n’t be mad with it because it was a personal best , but if i ’d held back a bit on the back straight and really gone for it with 200 metres to go then i think i could have maybe gone 3.33 high / 3.34 low , ’ he says of his 1,500m display at the @entity9 @entity8 meeting , which saw him finish fifth in a time of 3:35.06			1
such is life when you ’re a young athlete looking to scale new heights in front of an expectant home crowd in the biggest event of your career			2
going for gold : @entity26 will compete for @entity27 in the 1,500m at the @entity29 cycling innovator sir @entity30 calls them ‘ marginal gains ’ , the tiny details which can all add up to a huge performance			1
as @entity4 gears up for @entity9 2014 , he ’s all too aware of just how important even the smallest of changes can be			2
‘ i always seem to come out of a season thinking : “ if i ’d done something a wee bit different , i could have maybe run a second faster ” , ’ he admits			2
‘ i ’m the least patient person when it comes to running			2
‘ patience is key , though , over the 1,500m as you only get one or two moves and , if you do them at the wrong time , then you ’re out of luck			1
i need to be a bit more patient in a championship setting			0
‘ i ’m happy with where i ’m at physically and i just have a couple of things i need to tune up			2
i need to get my head sorted out and prepare myself for being patient , basically			0
‘ at the @entity56 , i got excited and went for it with 300m to go because the crowd were going crazy and i thought : “ i ’m just going for it ”			0
but that ’s then probably the biggest lesson i ’ll take away from it - to not let the crowd influence my moves			2
’ familiar : @entity26 ran at @entity3 in the @entity56 meeting and earned a personal best the final stages of ‘ tuning up ’ will take place largely at @entity27 ’s athletics base in @entity71 , where the 23 - year - old from @entity73 will join up with a squad which clearly means business			1
as a sign of their growing strength , seven @entity76 - including @entity4 and fellow 1,500m runner @entity77 - have been included in the @entity81 squad for next month ’s @entity82			1
‘ i remember saying this time last year that @entity85 athletes in general have really stepped their game up , ’ continues @entity4			0
‘ they knew that @entity9 was what they wanted to do and that ’s what they ’ve put all of their efforts into			0
everyone has done a good job of preparing themselves			0
‘ this is by far the strongest @entity76 team that i ’ve seen going to a @entity29 - and by far the most professional			1
‘ i ’m excited to go to @entity9 and be part of that team that has expectations and nobody ’s scared to say : “ i want to be in the final ”			0
that ’s great to see			0
company : @entity26 will be joined on the track by fellow @entity76 1,500m runner @entity77 ‘ yes , it ’s going to be great being in @entity3 but we ’re looking to that as an inspiration to go above and beyond what ’s expected of us			1
’ @entity4 was hugely impressed by his first visit to the home of @entity76 football in its current guise as an athletics arena , but it was n’t the only thing with a @entity121 background to have caught his attention			1
the 20 - year - old @entity77 was on his shoulder at the finish line and @entity4 could not be more enthusiastic about the ‘ @entity76 1,500m force ’ which is beginning to emerge			1
‘ he ’s three years younger than me , so to see him running that time was fantastic , ’ he adds			2
‘ he ’s a massively talented guy and he ’s raced a lot this year and , at that age , that ’s sometimes what you need to do			0
‘ he qualified outright for the @entity132 and he ’s qualified comfortably for the @entity133			0
it ’s exciting to be part of a @entity76 1,500m force that is coming through and , more importantly , a massive step up in @entity85 1,500m running			1
’ @entity139 : seven @entity76 athletes have been included in @entity81 's squad for the @entity82 provided everything goes to plan , @entity4 ’s big moment will come on the last night of the athletics competition in @entity9			1
it ’s the same session in which @entity146 is expected to run for @entity147 in the 4 x100m relay , so the recipe of a world superstar strutting his stuff and a @entity76 hope aiming to medal could be something for a capacity crowd to feast on			1
as you would expect from someone so focused , however , @entity4 is not getting ahead of himself			0
‘ yes , that ’s if i make the final , which is the first step on the agenda , ’ he says			0
‘ when you go and have a good run and you ’re down the back straight with someone like @entity166 , everybody steps their expectations up for you			0
‘ it ’s a fantastic opportunity and i think everybody will be thinking : “ i do n’t want to look back when i retire and think i could have done a whole lot better in @entity9 ”			0
excited : @entity26 is looking forward to running in front of an expectant home crowd at @entity9 's @entity3			1

@entity26 was not happy with his first taste of the @entity3 track despite running a 1,500m personal best of 3:35.06 and finish fifth in a high - class field
@entity76 athlete is aware that the tiniest of margins could be key to *success*
seven @entity76 , including @entity185 and @entity77 , have been included in the @entity81 squad for next month 's @entity82
