detective sergeant @entity7 and detective constable @entity8 were filmed on secret cameras taking cash and pens planted by their fellow officers			1
a court heard today how @entity7 , 45 , was caught taking £ 250 when he was called to a house colleagues told him was ' under criminal investigation '			1
detective sergeant @entity7 ( left ) stole money from a house in @entity19 and detective constable @entity8 ( right ) pocketed pens @entity8 , 44 , was also vidoed pocketing two pens while he carried out the investigation using a search warrant			1
both men however left other items put out by suspicious colleagues as part of the sting - including sex aid @entity28 tablets			0
the court heard the officers thought they were investigating a burglary but the scene was in fact set up as part of ' trust exercise ' by police chiefs			2
a team of officers including @entity8 and @entity7 were sent to the house which was filled with ' evidence ' including the @entity28 , bags , mobile phones , watches and £ 21,647 of cash			1
but they did n't realise the property had been fitted with hidden cameras and covert microphones - and a woman posing as a resident was an undercover detective			0
the pair - who have been suspended by @entity56 - admitting theft today and were warned they faced custody			0
judge @entity59 told them : ' there can be few examples of a graver breach of trust			2
this is a gross breach of trust in relation to the force and what the public expect from the police			1
the pair were sent to a fake ' crime scene ' by their colleagues , who had planted secret cameras in the property ' it 's not about the cost , it 's about the breach of trust and at first blush it appears to me that this is a custody case			1
' the officers , who are based in @entity86 , near @entity87 , were part of a team investigating organised crime but ended up being investigated themselves by @entity56 's corruption unit for theft and misconduct			0
@entity95 @entity94 heard how the force decided to carry out an ' integrity test ' on the pair			1
they pretended they were asked by @entity101 to investigate a property allegedly linked to a series of burglaries			0
officers left @entity28 tablets at the property as part of the sting operation prosecutor @entity109 said : ' @entity7 was filmed putting his hand inside a coat pocket and finding £ 240			1
' he removes his hand and leaves the scene - but then returns 20 seconds later when he removes the cash and places it in his pocket			0
' @entity7 also took £ 10 from a bedside table			2
but he did not realise all the notes had been marked with invisible ink and the serial numbers recorded			0
@entity8 was filmed going into the bedroom and taking two pens during the raid in march this year			2
the pair then drove up the @entity125 to meet plain clothes officers from @entity101 at a service station			0
while waiting for the meeting , @entity7 spent £ 60 of money on a @entity131 - themed gambling machine			2
as they drove back to @entity19 they were pulled over by a marked police car and arrested by members of their force 's @entity136			0
the court heard @entity139 , of @entity140 , @entity86 , claimed he was going to return the money to the woman who lived at the house			0
