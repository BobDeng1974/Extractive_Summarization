@entity0 are 20 games without defeat this season but @entity4 will never again be deceived by the illusion of a long unbeaten run			1
the pain remains fresh from the time when @entity9 did not lose until the 29th and penultimate game of the @entity12 season — and still did not emerge with the title			1
@entity14 finished one point better off in a season when @entity9 were also beaten in the @entity18 final and lost to @entity0 in the @entity20 final			1
@entity4 ( right ) fights for the ball with @entity22 during @entity0 's game against @entity24 @entity4 has received plaudits for his impressive performances in holding midfield for @entity0 this season ‘ we lost three titles in two weeks , ’ recalled @entity4			1
‘ it was very hard to take			2
these things happen only one season in a thousand years			2
we played well the whole season and were unbeaten for so long			2
it shows you can never be certain of anything			0
‘ if we want to win the league we must continue like this until the end			1
even if we ’re top and unbeaten with two games to go we must not believe we ’ve won it			2
we must not stop until the title is ours			2
we must fight and at @entity0 i believe we are ready for that			1
’ having dropped two points at @entity24 on saturday , the @entity45 leaders are now six clear of champions @entity47 as they move into a congested december fixture list , starting at home to @entity50 on wednesday			0
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 have taken so much of the credit for @entity0 ’s best - ever start but those inside the camp know the contribution of @entity4 has been immense			1
his midfield power provides the platform for others to sparkle and it is a role he relishes , even though he was a creative no 10 before being converted by @entity9 boss @entity61 into the position made famous at @entity63 by @entity64			1
@entity4 ( centre left ) appears with @entity50 's @entity67 ( centre right ) ahead of the release of game ' the crew ' @entity4 ( top ) vies for the ball with @entity74 's @entity73 during a @entity45 match in november ‘ i ’m happy to be asked about @entity64 , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ that means i must be doing something right			0
@entity64 is just a legend ; one of the best players in the history of @entity0			1
i know what i can do			0
i work really hard and the people will have to decide if we compare			0
‘ the defensive midfielder has to win the ball and give it to the attacking players to create the game			1
we all do what we have to do in the game			2
we are happy like this			0
‘ i used to play as a no 10 before i was tall like this			0
but in this team ? no , the others are better than me			0
i will stay where i am , in defensive midfield			0
’ @entity4 has travelled far since he was released by the academy at @entity99			1
‘ i was there almost five years and one day they said there was no space for me and i had to move , ’ he said			0
@entity4 ( right ) was a no 10 before @entity61 turned him into a holding midfielder at @entity9 @entity4 is flattered by the comparisons between himself and former @entity0 holding midfielder @entity64 from @entity108 ’s most famous club he dipped briefly into @entity108 ’s lower leagues and , six months later , at 18 , signed for @entity110 in @entity111			1
‘ i was young and alone there , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i did n’t know the language			0
i did n’t have friends and family and things like this have made me stronger			0
’ legend has it , @entity99 thought he was too frail , but @entity4 has filled out his 6ft 4in frame to become a muscular force to match his father @entity121 , once a combative central midfielder in the @entity124 second division			1
‘ i have seen some of his games on video cassettes but i ’ve told him it was not good football , you can ( pass ) the ball back to the goalkeeper , ’ smiled @entity4			1
‘ i can not speak to him about football because he is never happy with my game			2
if i do something great , he does n’t see this			0
he only picks up on my mistakes			0
‘ he watches all my games on tv in @entity108 , with his friends and after the game he will send me a message if we win : “ congratulations , but … ”			1
’ @entity4 ( right ) not only lost out on the @entity12 title after 28 games unbeaten at @entity9 , but they also lost to @entity0 in the @entity20 final in the same season ( pictured ) @entity4 is comforted by now team - mate @entity150 after the @entity20 final in may 2013 tough - love roles change when it comes to his younger brother @entity154 , who has followed a similar path via @entity110 and @entity9 and now plays for @entity156 in @entity157			1
‘ he has quality but he needs to work a lot , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i tell him to work hard and fight for his position			0
he needs to do better if he wants to go to a better level			0
’ hard knocks have made @entity4 the midfield warrior he is			2
he faced rejection at youth level and again when @entity0 signed him in 2009 , only to let him leave for @entity9 18 months later as a makeweight in the @entity169 deal			1
‘ to be honest it was not easy , ’ he said			0
‘ everybody was asking why i was back , but i wanted to show i had quality to play for @entity0 in the @entity45			2
when i first came , i was very young , and now i ’m 26 and it is a big difference			0
i have lots of experience			0
‘ at @entity9 , i played in the @entity176 , i fought every year for the title and these things have made me stronger			1
i did good work in @entity9			2
i always fought for a position with the big players and this has made me better			0
’ since his return to @entity0 in january , he has become one of the pillars of a team comfortable with the challenge of stretching their unbeaten run into the @entity189 and beyond			1
‘ you can say the record is putting pressure on us but i would rather have it this way than lose , ’ said @entity4 , who has only lost four times in 42 @entity0 appearances			1
‘ i want to win every game			2
we are only interested in winning			0
it will be difficult to go through the whole season — we have many games to play against very good teams — but anything is possible			0
we know our qualities and what we can do			0
maybe we can remain unbeaten			2
it depends only on us			0
if we win every game we are going to be champions			2
we know that is going to be hard but we are ready to fight			0
’ @entity4 was appearing at a photo - shoot with a crew of fans to celebrate the launch of @entity215 , a revolutionary new action - driving game from @entity218 , out now on @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 .			1

@entity4 was at @entity9 when they missed out on the title
they were unbeaten until their 29th game , but still did **n't** win the league
now at @entity0 , he wo **n't** be deceived by the illusion of an unbeaten run
@entity4 is flattered by the comparison between him and @entity64
