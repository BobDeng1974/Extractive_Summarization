a politician 's push for same - sex marriage to be legalised in @entity3 has earned him scores of homophobic hate mail and even death threats			1
one handwritten note sent to @entity8 senator @entity8 on wednesday calls him a ' filthy animal ' and states ' someone should give you a blast of shotgun			1
preferably in the stomach '			0
senator @entity8 's @entity17 aims to ' prevent the government from stopping two people from getting married on the grounds that they are not a man and a woman '			1
the vile note sent to him by one anonymous homophobe not only threatens his life but also warns ' there will be a curse on you and your family '			1
but the politician , who has been together with the woman he calls his ' wife ' for 30 years although choosing not to legally marry , has vowed not to be deterred from having his bill debated			1
' we actively support freedom of speech , but this does not reflect well on the company people who oppose our freedom to marry @entity41 are keeping , ' senator @entity8 told @entity42			1
amongst the emails and letters he has received is a 14 - page document that claims to be ' evidence indicating the inappropriateness of sponsoring same sex marriages '			1
the 7,000 word rambling missive that the @entity57 received also compares homosexuality to ' alcoholism , paedophilia , gambling , raping '			2
' if we assume homosexuality is genetically based , it still does not make it desirable or appropriate , ' the letter says			2
one man , calling himself a @entity44 supporter , wrote : ' perhaps you could propose another form of @entity81 for those who do not want to associate themselves with homosexual ( or any other fringe sexuality ) union			0
' another email says : ' homosexuals are not born homosexuals ... homosexuality is a choice			0
choices are influenced by our inherent sinful nature and the pervertedness of the society in which we live			0
' senator @entity8 's @entity97 aims to get the government out of people 's bedrooms one email from someone claiming to be a doctor reads homosexuality ca n't ' be condoned in our society ' amongst the emails and letters he has received is a 14 - page document that claims to be ' evidence indicating the inappropriateness of sponsoring same sex marriages ' one email from someone claiming to be a doctor reads : ' how come you are a qualified vet and yet you do n't seem to realise that bisexuality , pedophilia and homosexuality are all biological defects of sexual attraction			1
none of these can be condoned in our society			0
' many of the letters warn of a ' harmful ' effect on society if the bill is passed			0
' all my @entity97 to marry @entity17 does is prevent the government from stopping two people from getting married on the grounds that they are not a man and a woman , ' the senator wrote in an article for the @entity137 this week			1
' it 's based on the view that people ought to have the freedom to choose their own life path			2
as @entity146 said , " over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign "			0
' one man , calling himself a @entity44 supporter , wrote : ' perhaps you could propose another form of @entity81 for those who do not want to associate themselves with homosexual ' before hoping to present his bill to the @entity154 on thursday , @entity8 wrote : ' my bill requires nothing more than tolerance â€“ a decision to stop minding other people 's business			2
' however , the parliamentary debate on legalising same - sex marriage is now on hold for a few months			0
the @entity154 was scheduled to debate the private bill on thursday , only for it to make way for the government 's data retention legislation			0
but senator @entity8 says any debate would have been ' somewhat artificial ' without @entity171 being allowed a conscience vote			1
' i do have a very good speech ready , ' he told reporters in @entity176			0
it 's likely a debate on @entity8 's bill wo n't take place until mid-june at the earliest .			2

it came as he prepared to debate his freedom to marry @entity17 in the senate
the letter calls him a ' filthy animal ' and threatens a curse on his family
@entity8 has received many homophobic letters and emails
' this does not reflect well on the company people who oppose our @entity201 to marry @entity41 are keeping , ' the politician said
