by @entity0 @entity1 , who unwittingly became the centre of an internet sensation after her name was used in a story about a castaway on a desert island a woman who supposedly survived on a desert island by drinking rainwater from coconut shells and killing a goat with a clam shell for food , has revealed that the whole story was a hoax			1
@entity1 's story of rescue went viral when her image was posted online and shared and retweeted hundreds of thousands of times			1
the accompanying story claimed that she and two friends set sail from @entity24 to @entity25 in 2007 but hit a freak storm in which her friends were blown overboard and died			1
but the tale was merely a prank , played upon the 26 - year - old by her friends , mocking her comparatively simple lifestyle to the internet fantasy they had concocted for her			2
according to the story , posted on news - hound.org , miss @entity1 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , was eventually rescued when she made a giant @entity39 sign on the beach and it was spotted by ' a kid from @entity42 on @entity43 '			1
the article has since been shared thousands of times on @entity46 and @entity47			0
' the people behind the website are just good friends with a strange sense of humour and busy brain , ' she said			0
' they posted the story then messaged me saying they were going to make me famous			2
i thought the story was a good one and it made me laugh			0
' referring to the goat - killing story , she said : ' i ca n't kill a spider never mind smash a goat 's head in			2
' she added : ' i thought it would get a few likes but did n't expect this			0
' a surprising amount of people thought it was real			0
i feel bad disappointing them but it 's just a laugh			0
' the story claimed miss @entity1 , from @entity36 , had been marooned on a desert island near @entity25 for seven years and that her @entity74 sign was spotted on @entity43 by a ' kid in @entity42 ' miss @entity1 , a saleswoman , said her real life with her boyfriend and dog was far from her internet castaway adventure			1
' my friend at news - hound had been skitting me about how happy i was with my simple lifestyle , which is probably another reason behind them writing such a ridiculous story about me			0
the original story - ' @entity86 trapped on @entity87 ' - claims @entity1 s makeshift @entity39 message was finally found thanks to @entity43			1
but the tale was merely a prank played upon the 26 - year - old by her friends ( who also superimposed this picture of her onto the body of a castaway ) , mocking her comparatively simple lifestyle to the internet fantasy life they had concocted for her in reality , the image is from a 2010 @entity104 report on violence in @entity106 - the uncropped picture shows buildings in the background			1
adding to the hoax , the details of her survival are not only fake but plagiarised - with huge chunks lifted from the survival experience of actual explorer @entity114			0
for the record , miss @entity1 has no sailing experience and no imminent plans to recreate her fictional adventure .			2

@entity1 's image unwittingly posted online along with survival tale
claimed she and two friends set sail from @entity24 to @entity25 in 2007
it also said that their ship but hit freak storm and her friends died
the tale said she was rescued after @entity39 sign was spotted on @entity43 '
but the story was just an internet prank set up by ' *imaginative* friends '
