with @entity31 battling for survival , the @entity12 will be wary of a similarly damaging result when they take on @entity78 's spirited team in front of the @entity81 cameras			2
but if they do manage to take three points from @entity6 , @entity5 will still be on target to match their best ever winning streak in the @entity3 era by the time the season is over			2
the @entity12 hold the record for the most consecutive wins , having come out on top in 14 successive games between february and august in 2002			1

aided by the goals of @entity120 and @entity121 , @entity123 ' side also managed 11 straight wins between february and april before losing 2 - 0 at home to @entity24			0
@entity27 were just one victory away from equalling their best run of eight straight wins earlier this season but they could n't quite manage to repeat the feat they managed between december 2013 and january 2014			1
the @entity12 hold the record for the most consecutive victories - winning 14 games to clinch the title in 2002 @entity92 's winning streak of 12 games helped sir @entity101 's men to the title in 1999 - 00 @entity24 striker @entity139 slides the ball home at @entity142 to end @entity34 's 11 - game winning run last season @entity58 also put together their best ever run in the @entity3 last season , earning seven wins on the bounce between march and april last year as they tried and failed to break into the top four			1
@entity43 won seven straight games in 1996 , while @entity15 managed one less in the last three months of 2011			0

struggling @entity53 could do with repeating the three - match winning steak they put together in march 1995 , while @entity31 's two consecutive victories last november remains their most impressive run .			0

@entity27 also managed seven wins on the bounce this season
the @entity12 can match their own record if they win their remaining games
