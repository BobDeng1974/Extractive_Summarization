@entity0 was bundled into a police van after giving his girlfriend @entity3 a kiss on the cheek when @entity0 planted an innocent peck on his girlfriend ’s cheek over sunday lunch , he never imagined it would see him bundled into a police van and warned about his behaviour			1
mr @entity0 ’s romantic gesture offended one diner so much that she complained to staff , who then asked the civil engineer and his partner @entity3 to move tables			1
when he refused , the 43 - year - old said he was ‘ shocked ’ to see four police officers arrive and march him outside where he was told he was not welcome in the restaurant			1
mr @entity0 said yesterday : ‘ it is ridiculous			1
it was just a kiss – it ’s not like we were there with our tongues down each other ’s throats			2
’ the trouble started after the @entity34 couple went to @entity36 restaurant at @entity37 in the town for a family meal with miss @entity3 ’s five - year - old son , @entity40 , last month			1
@entity41 , 40 , said they left @entity40 in the soft play area and as the restaurant was busy , asked if they could share a large table nearby occupied by a lone man so they could keep an eye on the boy			1
when the man was joined by his wife , mr @entity0 noticed that she ‘ was n’t happy ’ to find she was now sharing her table			1
he said : ‘ it was packed and there were n’t any tables and there was one guy on his own			0
@entity3 said can we sit there and he said no problem			1
‘ this woman turns up and right away i could see she was n’t happy			0
we were ignoring them and just talking quietly and i leaned across and had a wee peck on the cheek , nothing more			2
‘ the woman drops her knife and fork and said , “ that ’s disgusting , i ’m sat here trying to have meal with my husband			0
” ’ complaint : the @entity36 restaurant in @entity34 where the couple were told to leave miss @entity3 added : ‘ i said , “ @entity75 ” because i was really shocked and she said , “ get away from the table ” and we just ignored her			1
’ mr @entity0 went on : ‘ she goes and gets the manager , who comes over and says , “ this lady wants you to move			1
can you take your drinks through to the soft play area ? ” she said , “ i ’m asking you nicely to move			2
” ‘ the manager wanted to defuse the situation but she was siding with them , which got my back up a little bit so i said no , we had n’t done anything			0
i said , “ i ’m not moving , you ’re going to have to physically move me			2
” ‘ this was all said quietly , no raised voices			0
the manager went away – i thought maybe a bouncer or someone might come over			0
‘ the next thing i know two police came in and put their hands on my shoulder and asked me to go with them to answer questions			1
while i was in the van two more came up in another van			0
‘ i thought something might happen , but four policemen was a surprise			0
i told them what happened and they said it was n’t a problem , but told me the manager never wants us back			0
‘ it was just a wee peck on the cheek			2
’ miss @entity3 added : ‘ they had @entity0 in the back of a van and then another van arrived			1
‘ just because he ’s kissed me on the cheek they ’ve been extremely offended by this but the place is full of families – i was there as a family			0
i was absolutely horrified – my son ’s five and was petrified saying , “ what have we done ? ” ‘ it was so embarrassing – people were looking at us as though we were criminals			0
’ @entity134 confirmed officers attended the pub ‘ following a report of a customer dispute with staff ’ at 4.20pm on february 9			0
a spokesman said that the ‘ situation was amicably resolved on police attendance ’ and that no one was arrested or charged			0
the @entity36 is run by the @entity145 chain , part of the @entity147 , and advertises itself as a family and children - friendly environment			2
a @entity145 spokesman said : ' having spoken to our team members at the @entity36 , we are satisfied that staff acted appropriately in this instance			1
' on the day in question two customers sat down , uninvited , at a table where another couple were already dining			0
' having interrupted the couple 's meal , they then began behaving in a way that other diners found excessive and inappropriate			0
' following complaints to staff , they were asked to move to another table , which they refused to do			1
' they then started using abusive language towards other diners and staff , at which point the police were called			1
the incident was dealt with at the scene and no further action was needed			0
' as a venue for thousands of family celebrations every week , we have no policy that prevents couples from giving each other a kiss on the cheek in our restaurants			2
