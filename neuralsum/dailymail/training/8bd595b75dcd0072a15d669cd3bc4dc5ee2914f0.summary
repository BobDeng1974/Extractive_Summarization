@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 are all ‘ global warming @entity3 ’			1
this is according to scientist @entity6 , who is a professor at the @entity7 at @entity8 and a vocal denier of man - made climate change			1
dr @entity6 believe that people who label those against human - induced global warming ‘ climate deniers ’ will ‘ kill far more people than the @entity3 ever did			1
’ the radical claim was made by climate scientist @entity6 , who is a professor at the @entity7 at @entity8 and a vocal denier of man - made climate change he argues , these same people should be appropriately labelled as ‘ global warming nazis			1
’ ‘ when politicians and scientists started calling people like me “ deniers ” , they crossed the line			1
they are still doing it , ’ he wrote in a blog post published yesterday			1
@entity1 is known to have used the term ' climate change denier ' along with @entity0 , @entity2 , @entity34 and @entity35 use of the term ' climate deniers ' became controversial after @entity39 , former @entity40 prime minister , said that the term was used with ' malice aforethought '			2
but in november , deputy prime minister @entity34 said he is entitled to call @entity45 climate sceptics ' deniers ' despite a warning by the government 's chief scientist that it is an abusive term			2
' surely i can agree with his scientific advice without agreeing with the choice of verbs , adjectives or nouns , ' @entity34 said			0
sir @entity56 told @entity57 last year that he was uncomfortable with the term			0
he said : ' as far as possible it is always best to avoid abuse			0
' people do get heated and emotional about this			0
but we have to be clear that those who argue against the human contribution of climate change are wrong			0
' ‘ they indirectly equate the sceptics ' view that global warming is not necessarily all manmade nor a serious problem , with the denial that the @entity75 's extermination of millions of @entity76 ever happened ’ wrote @entity6 on his blog			1
‘ too many of us for too long have ignored the repulsive , extremist nature of the comparison , ’ he continues			2
‘ it 's time to push back			0
' his reasoning in using the word @entity3 is because climate activists are , in his words , ' anti-capitalist fascists '			1
‘ [ they are ] willing to sacrifice millions of lives of poor people at the altar of radical environmentalism , ’ he wrote			1
the words come from a prominent figure in debates surrounding climate change			0
dr @entity6 has been a called number of times by the @entity98 to give evidence to @entity100			2
but the term ‘ climate change denier ’ is n’t hated by everyone			1
dr @entity104 , when asked which descriptive term he preferred , said : ‘ i actually like “ denier			2
” that 's closer than " sceptic " ’			0
@entity109 , the operator of the climate change denial website @entity109 , told @entity112 , ‘ me , i just stick with " denier " ... i 'm happy to be a denier			0
’ dr @entity6 has previously said : ‘ i view my job a little like a legislator , supported by the taxpayer , to protect the interests of the taxpayer and to minimise the role of government			1
’ in the opening and closing of his blog , he writes : ‘ yeah , somebody pushed my button			1
' ' deniers ' are termed people that believe that global warming is either not occurring , or is not associated with the man - made rise in carbon dioxide			1
they have been heavily criticised for being pseudoscientific , despite an alleged overwhelming consensus on the reality of climate change			0
journalists and policitican - including environmentalist @entity139 - have described such scepticism as a form of denialism			0
several commentators have also compared climate change denial with @entity146 denial , although others who believe in man - made climate change have condemned such comparisons as inappropriate and trivialising holocaust denial			0
@entity139 wrote in his @entity152 opinion column that he uses the term for those who attempt to undermine scientific opinion on climate change due to financial interests			0
@entity139 often refers to a ' denial industry ' , however other commentators have been described climate change ' deniers ' , including politicians and writers , who are not obviously linked to any industry group			2
in recent years the term has been associated with a series of views challenging the scientific consensus on issues including the health effects of smoking and the relationship between @entity171 and @entity172 , along with climate change .			0

claim was made by @entity6 , a professor at @entity7
‘ when politicians and scientists started calling people like me “ deniers ” , they crossed the line . they are still doing it , ’ he wrote in a blog post
his reasoning for using the word ' @entity75 ' is because climate activists are , he claims , anti-capitalist fascists
