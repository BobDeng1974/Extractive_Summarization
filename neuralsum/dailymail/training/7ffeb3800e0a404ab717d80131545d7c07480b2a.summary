it 's not just a fourth stand they are building at @entity3			1
sadly for @entity5 , though , they will have to wait a while longer to underline their progress by taking the scalp of a big team			2
for large swathes of this match , it looked possible			2
@entity14 were often desperately poor and @entity3 were frequently exciting			1
they attacked with pace and without fear ; they created chances and did everything except take them			2
twice @entity22 won headers within a dangerous range and twice he beat @entity26 in @entity14 ’s goal			1
twice , there was a man waiting on the line to clear			1
that final yard was the hurdle and curse for a club who only have three quarters of a stadium , but dream big and sit second in @entity38			0
@entity14 striker @entity39 celebrate putting @entity41 's side into a 1 - 0 lead against @entity3 the @entity44 striker meets @entity46 's cross at the far post to send the away side into the @entity50 fifth round @entity39 salutes the travelling fans after coming off the bench and giving the @entity53 a crucial late lead @entity39 and @entity55 celebrate in front of the @entity58 faithful at @entity59 @entity3 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : fielding 6 @entity60 6 , @entity61 7 , @entity62 6.5 ; little 6.5 ( @entity63 75 , 6 ) , @entity64 6.5 , @entity65 7 ( @entity66 83 ) , @entity67 6.5 ( pack 83 ) , @entity68 6.5 ; @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 6.5 subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 manager : @entity5 6.5 @entity14 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity26 6 ; @entity77 7 , @entity78 6 , @entity79 6.5 , @entity80 6.5 ; noble 5.5 , @entity81 5 ( @entity82 57 , 6 ) , @entity83 5 ( @entity84 88 ) ; @entity85 6 ; @entity46 6.5 , @entity86 4.5 ( @entity39 57 , 7.5 ) subs not used : @entity88 , @entity84 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 booked : @entity83 , @entity92 manager : @entity41 7.5 referee : @entity95 6 attendance : 12,682 player rating by @entity99 - @entity98 ‘ all we needed was that final touch , ’ said @entity5			1
for @entity41 , there can only be relief that @entity39 was fit after three weeks out and able to come off his bench to head an 81st - minute winner			1
certainly any pride will need to be balanced against what was a weak performance , particularly from his midfielders			0
but into the draw they go and that , for this club more than some , is important			0
@entity41 knows his side have an opportunity in this competition in light of saturday ’s magnificent upsets – not to mention the freedom afforded by @entity14 ’s good league position – and it was the gist of his team talk			1
@entity41 said : ‘ i said to the players , “ do n’t be a victim			0
do n’t be another casualty			0
be professional in what you do and if they are to beat you they have to produce something special ”			0
it was a hard - earned victory and one we are grateful for			0
‘ a team in the lower divisions can , in one day , beat the most forceful team in the @entity137			0
@entity138 conceded four at home to @entity140			0
big teams can always get knocked out			0
gladly we are one of the bigger teams not crying all the way home			0
‘ now it will all depend on the draw			0
i know it ’s said that somewhere along the line you are going to get a @entity137 team			2
but i hope we get them when we ’re in the final and not before			0
’ @entity5 , meanwhile , tried to strike a philosophical tone but knows a chance went untaken			0
‘ we wo n’t be slitting our wrists because we got beat 1 - 0 by @entity14 , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s just a slight disappointment because with a bit of luck we might have knocked them out			0
‘ i think the results on saturday made it more difficult for us			2
i am not saying @entity14 would n’t have been focused but if they were n’t then those results would have made them more focused			1
‘ they picked a good , strong , experienced team			0
’ indeed , @entity41 made only one change to the side that crushed @entity168 in the @entity137 last weekend , with @entity79 stepping in for @entity169 , who has a back problem			0
it was about as strong a side as @entity14 could field ; it was a side that spent all but the final 10 minutes of the first half struggling to draw breath			1
@entity39 is joined by his jubilant team - mates , including @entity46 , whose right - footed cross found its marker @entity92 of heads off the line to deny @entity22 as @entity14 came under pressure during the early stages at @entity59 @entity3 striker @entity22 rises above @entity79 but but his header flies over the @entity14 crossbar the 25 - year - old striker rests on his knees after missing one of several chances that came his way on sunday @entity67 shows no fear as he reach for the ball with a high boot against @entity58 midfielder @entity83 @entity65 ( right ) looks to shield the ball from @entity78 during a difficult first half for the @entity58 our brilliant @entity196 service shows that @entity39 's far post header came after good work down the right from @entity46 with an extra man in the middle , @entity3 were winning the battle for midfield and in @entity65 , once of @entity205 but more recently @entity206 , they had a man who was able to take control			1
in @entity81 , @entity14 had a top - class midfielder on loan from @entity211 who seemingly could n’t pass to a team - mate			1
combined , it meant @entity3 were on top for most of the half , happy to counter or dictate			1
the first warning was sounded after six minutes when @entity22 ’s header beat @entity26 and was cleared by @entity92			1
@entity22 then sent a second header past the keeper , only to be brilliantly cleared by @entity46			1
@entity14 looked in desperate trouble			2
in one challenge , @entity69 floored @entity79 – the clichés about lower league sides making life uncomfortable for the big boys were also acted out			0
@entity41 responded by hooking off @entity81 and @entity227 for @entity82 and @entity39 shortly after the restart and @entity14 gradually held more possession			1
but even then there was no evidence that one side is almost two divisions to the north of the other , @entity22 underlying the point by heading over			2
but then @entity39 took hold of this game			2
in the space of two minutes he was blocked by @entity239 and also grazed the bar after showing some delightful skill on his way to goal			2
when @entity46 hooked over a cross 10 minutes from time @entity39 jumped up and won the game , even if @entity22 was given the opportunity to miss yet another header			1
‘ we were never at our very best but we did enough to get through to the next round , ’ @entity41 said			2
in the context of a remarkable weekend , that will have to do			0
@entity22 thought he had given @entity3 a deserved lead after sending his header towards goal only to see it cleared by @entity46 @entity58 goalkeeper @entity26 ( right ) spreads himself wide as @entity257 meets the ball at the far post @entity257 puts his head in his hands as another half - chance goes begging for the home side @entity3 striker @entity22 ( centre ) laughs as he is fouled by @entity58 defender @entity79 during the @entity50 clash @entity65 is surrounded as by @entity92 ( left ) and @entity79 ( right ) as the @entity268 star looks to drive his team forwards @entity227 ( left ) is fouled by @entity68 during at goalless first 45 minutes on sunday afternoon @entity5 shouts instructions to his players as @entity86 is left crumpled in a heap following @entity68 's challenge @entity14 boss @entity41 has words with the fourth official on the touchline during the @entity50 match @entity69 ( left ) rides the challenge of @entity280 battle as the pair battle for the ball during the first half @entity3 fans tie their scarves together as they show their support for their team ahead of kick - off @entity41 celebrates the victory by giving former @entity205 midfielder @entity81 an impromptu massage			1
