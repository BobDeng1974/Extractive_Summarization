@entity0 believes the turning point of @entity3 ’s season came when @entity4 was sent off against @entity5 in @entity6 as it allowed @entity7 to turn to his fringe players			1
@entity9 was sent off in the @entity6 tie at @entity11 after picking up two yellow cards – one for simulation and one for decent – and forced the @entity3 boss to change his starting line - up			2
the £ 60million signing missed @entity3 ’s impressive 3 - 0 win over @entity18 in which @entity19 was one of the stand out players and a result that sparked @entity3 ’s impressive run of form which has seen them go on and beat @entity25 and @entity26 in recent weeks			1
@entity19 celebrates scoring against @entity26 as @entity3 continue their good run of form @entity4 was sent off against @entity5 in the @entity6 back in march writing in his @entity30 column , @entity0 said : ‘ when i look back on the key changes , i still feel that @entity4 ’s red card against @entity5 was critical in allowing @entity33 to build this new - look team			1
looking at the side it seems to me to be a triumph of the underdog – @entity38 , @entity19 , @entity39			1
all of whom looked like they could be out the picture at the start of the season and are now having a big impact			0
’ despite @entity3 ’s impressive run of form which has seen them pick up 25 points from their last 10 games – @entity0 says they are still some way off challenging for the title and putting a good run a form together towards the end of the season is not what makes a great team			2
@entity38 has been in good form for @entity3 in recent games scoring three in his last three games @entity0 says @entity3 's good run of form has come at a time when they have nothing to play for @entity0 says @entity3 needed to be consistent throughout the season and build up towards the end of the campaign – and not just turn on the style when they have nothing to play for			1
he added : ‘ amidst all this revival spirit i should point one thing out			0
@entity3 are putting the results together now with the pressure off , to a large extent			2
they are too far off in the title race – barring a total collapse from @entity75 – and the only thing to play for is a @entity78 place			0
how many times over the years have we seen @entity5 turn on the form to get their top four spot at the end of the season when they have no chance of winning the title ? ‘ it is all well and good being strong in the last three months			0
the really serious teams are in there from the start and they get stronger before @entity89 and then into the run - in			0
there is a big difference between title form and a late surge for a @entity78 place			0

@entity4 's red card forced @entity7 to look at other players
@entity38 , @entity19 and @entity39 have been in good form in recent matches
@entity0 says @entity3 are playing well when they have nothing to play for
