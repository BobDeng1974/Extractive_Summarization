mocked : @entity1 senator @entity0 , 44 , has been mocked online by the prank presidential candidate @entity0 is being mocked online by internet pranksters who turned a site bearing his name into an ad for president @entity7 and his immigration reforms			1
while the 44 - year - old senator ( @entity9 ) was busy launching his campaign in @entity11 and touring tv studios , anybody logging onto @entity14 this week will have got a surprise			1
for , rather than being festooned with smiling pictures of the @entity19 darling and talking up his hopes of ' reigniting the promise of @entity23 ' , the page ribs him about two of his bugbears			1
the simple site has a black background and says , in large , grey text : ' support president obama			0
@entity29 now ! ' the presidential hopeful , who constantly castigates @entity7 and speaks out on border control , is using @entity32 for his campaign instead			2
it is hardly the only such jibe internet users have made at @entity0 's expense			0
@entity36 has been programmed to redirect users straight to healthcare.gov - the medical insurance exchange established by the president 's @entity40 laws			2
the site seems especially apt given that @entity0 today admitted that he himself is signing up for @entity40 , as he will no longer be covered by his wife 's plan			0
a third snub comes in the form of @entity48 , a site dedicated to reminding voters that @entity0 , son to a @entity53 father and @entity23 mother , was in fact born in @entity56			0
his place of birth is not widely thought to rule him out as a presidential contender , but will still function as a stick for critics to beat him with			0
to the point : logging on to @entity14 takes uers to the above page - two lines of text supporting @entity7 mocking : @entity36 sends users to the @entity40 health insurance website , above			1

@entity1 senator has been busy launching @entity72 bid for 2016
but anybody thinking @entity14 was his campaign site *due* for surprise
site instead blares out ' immigration reform now ! ' and praises @entity7
@entity19 darling 's actual campaign site is @entity83
@entity36 and @entity85 are also making fun of him
