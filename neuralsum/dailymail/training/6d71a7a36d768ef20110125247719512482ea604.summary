by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 17:01 est , 8 january 2014 facial oils , once the preserve of slightly batty aromatherapists and all but the crinkliest of crinklies , have gone mainstream over the past few years			1
@entity6 , always a litmus test of what ’s marketable and mainstream in beauty , is preparing to launch one on january 20 for the first time in the company 's history ( @entity15 , £ 24.99 , with ingredients that include orange peel , geranium and rose ) , while the shelves of boots already resemble the condiments section of @entity22 's			1
as someone who has always suffered from dry skin , i 've long been a fan of facial oils			1
i first started adding rosehip oil to my face cream in my early 20s			1
slick : @entity0 has long been a fan of facial oils back then , you could only get it from health food stores , stashed away between the bleach - free tampons and the linseed oils			1
@entity36 was the brand , all the way from the @entity39			0
the packaging looked like it had been designed by a yeti - and it did n't smell much better either			1
the brand still exists ( riorosa.co.uk ) and the product has since been refined a little - although not too much			0
it remains basic , but excellent : 100 per cent natural , lightweight , long - lasting and , at about £ 10 for 20 ml , very good value for money			0
its biggest and best rival is @entity47 , which is a rather slicker proposition in terms of packaging and marketing , including celebrity endorsements ( always a boon ) from @entity54 and @entity55			0
@entity0 recommends ... @entity56 , left , and @entity57 both these oils are pure rosehip			1
many of the newer facial oils on the market , however , offer a combination of ingredients , from plant and flower essential oils to other oils entirely - argan , avocado , carrot , raspberry , hazelnut , sesame and so on ( if you are allergic to nuts , do please check the ingredients of any oil you are thinking of buying )			1
some combine elements of nature with so - called ' cosmeceuticals ' : ingredients such as peptides to help brighten and decongest the skin , for example , or plant stem - cells			1
the biggest misconception about facial oils is that they are not suitable for oily or combination skins and that they will make your face look shiny and greasy			1
in fact , providing you use them judiciously , they can benefit all types , from the most sensitive to the most troublesome			1
on combination skins , for example , the right facial oil will help reduce the chances of acne scarring and even soothe break - outs			1
the skin condition rosacea , for example , is exacerbated by products that dry out the skin since stripping away the natural oils simply sends a signal to the body to produce more			1
acne - prone skin , especially in adults , is often also dehydrated - which is why it can be so hard to treat effectively			2
and anyone taking medication for their acne will also find that their skin becomes noticeably drier and tighter ; again , a few drops of the right oil will soothe and treat without leaving behind a heavy patina of product			2
this time of year , though , is hell for all skin types - especially given some of the mad weather we 've been having lately			1
cold winds , freezing rain , blow - heaters in shops and bone - dry central heating : this is when the facial oil really comes into its own			1
the key to remember is to use only the smallest amount			0
i have a big face and very dry skin , but if i 'm using the @entity143 , for example , two drops in the palm of a hand is more than enough			1
rub your hands together to warm the oil , and then just press your palms into your face before massaging in any excess			2
if you like , you can add a day or night cream over the top			0
if my skin is really dehydrated , i exfoliate first and then pop a treatment mask over the top ( not one of those clay ones , obviously , but a moisturising mask )			2
the only thing i would caution against is getting the stuff in your eyes - they will puff up ; and if you 're using an oil at night , allow it a couple of minutes to sink in before you turn the light out , otherwise you will just end up with a well - moisturised pillow case			0
banish bags : @entity165 under eye serum one of the most common complaints around this time of year is dark shadows and bags under the eyes			1
it 's a combination of factors : lack of sleep , early mornings , a general feeling of liverishness after all those mince pies and extra glasses of wine , and the kind of winter pallor that sets in after months without sunshine			0
the area under the eyes is a tricky one			0
the skin is thin , and there 's also not a lot of tissue there			2
as we get older , this can lead to a slightly cavernous effect , as the skin slackens and the supporting fat and muscle degrades			1
dark shadows deepen and loss of volume can be a problem			0
this can be corrected by surgery or , in some cases with filler ( known as tear - trough rejuvenation ) ; but the effects are not always an unqualified success - plus they are painful and expensive			0
before you resort to any of that , there is much that can be done with a few clever tricks			0
simply distracting the eye visually from your dark shadows is the first step			2
a good eyebrow shape , for example , opens up the eye area , framing the face and making you look brighter and more alert			1
eyelash curlers too will help			0
it can be tempting to try to eliminate dark shadows by piling on the under - eye concealer			2
this is not a good idea : everyone , even the most fresh of face , has a degree of shading under and around the eye , so if you strip this out altogether , you 'll just look weird , like those men from that strange @entity234 documentary the other night ( @entity235 , it was called , all about gentlemen who like to wear giant latex lady - suits in their leisure time			1
a total white - out will also make your eyes look smaller			0
so be judicious , and stay close to your natural skin tone to avoid the dreaded reverse - panda effect			2
dot the product on the inside of the eyes , near the bridge of the nose , under the eyes and at the edges , and blend well			0
crush ... @entity252 colour at its best - £ 33 , narscosmetics.com @entity257 ... ' bikini bridge ' aka a picture of a piece of @entity256 suspended over a concave stomach			0
go and eat cake , for heaven 's sake			0
if your bags are dreadful , there is something to be said for embracing them , and working the consumptive look			2
@entity269 black eyeliner and muted plums are ideal , or soft greys if you 're a blonde			0
avoid browns : they 'll just make you look even more tired			0
add a feverish flush to the cheeks , and you should get away with it			0
in terms of eye creams , serums and gels , it 's good to find one that has a rollerball applicator , since the process of circular massage will help decongest the area			2
again , do n't go overboard on the amount of product , but do make sure you keep the area well - hydrated , as dryness will only contribute to the look of exhaustion			2
@entity298 ( £ 22 ) , for example , is an excellent choice ; for what it 's worth i 'm very pleased with my @entity302 ( £ 29.50 , nourishskinrange.com ) .			0
