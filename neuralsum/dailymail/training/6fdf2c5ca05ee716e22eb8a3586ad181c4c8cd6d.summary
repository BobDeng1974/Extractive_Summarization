@entity0 have agreed a deal in principle to sign @entity5 's @entity4 defender @entity3 in a £ 15million transfer			1
with the 24 - year - old expected to join the club imminently it is likely to mean the saga surrounding @entity11 could see the @entity13 international move to @entity14 rather than the @entity15			1
as reported by @entity16 , @entity3 was withdrawn from his @entity20 club ’s @entity18 match this weekend increasing speculation that the centre - back was closing in on a move to the @entity15			1
@entity0 are edging closer to a deal for combative @entity4 centre back @entity3 ( front left ) @entity27 is strong in the air and will strengthen a leaky defence which has shipped 25 @entity31 goals it shows that although @entity0 have strongly been linked with 26 - year - old @entity13 international @entity35 , his £ 25m - plus fee is regarded as too much by @entity36			1
@entity11 seemingly keeps changing his mind about leaving @entity38			1
having suggested he would move on at the start of the window he has now hinted he might stay			0
but if @entity43 boss @entity42 is adamant he wants to play a 3 - 5 - 2 system then he needs an experienced centre back who knows how to play in the formation			1
@entity35 would seem the best available , although @entity48 could yet move for @entity50 ’s @entity49 even though he is currently injured			0
at £ 25m , @entity11 is thought to be outside @entity0 's price range , but he may interest @entity43 @entity49 , who worked with @entity48 at the @entity52 , could also be a target for the @entity54 @entity55 are considering a move for @entity57			1
the 33 - year - old forward is understood to be unhappy in @entity59 despite a reputed £ 4m - a - year salary			1
the former @entity61 , @entity43 and @entity63 player wants a move back to the @entity31 because he ’s not getting game time he wants			1
@entity57 is said to be unhappy at @entity59 , who face @entity0 in the @entity67 next month the mercurial @entity68 is handsomely paid in the principality but is wanted by a raft of @entity31 clubs palace boss @entity72 is looking for a no 10 type forward who can offer a different dimension to the raw pace @entity55 have front			1
@entity50 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 may also consider a loan deal for the @entity68			2
but the word coming from @entity59 was that the @entity84 club want to keep @entity57 in their squad given their @entity67 involvement			1
@entity87 will use their status on the edge of @entity92 football 's elite to persuade @entity93 to join them rather than @entity94			1
last week figures were released naming the club ’s with the biggest turnovers			2
@entity98 were followed by @entity43 , with eight @entity31 clubs ( @entity43 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity0 , @entity102 , @entity61 , @entity103 and @entity104 ) in the top 20			1
@entity93 ( left ) looks set to leave @entity14 after 342 appearances for the club @entity87 were ranked 21st and their move to the @entity109 in 2016 could move them into the top tier			1
it is an argument the club are also using to persuade @entity113 to sign a new deal			1
@entity102 expect @entity115 to sign a new contract this week			1
the deal will be in the region of £ 90,000 - a - week			1
@entity115 is set to put pen to paper on a new @entity102 deal which will stave off the likes of @entity98 it has been assumed that if @entity125 sacked @entity126 then @entity124 would step into his shoes			1
but former @entity61 boss @entity128 would be a strong contender given his close bond with @entity130 , who is now football advisor to @entity132 owner @entity131			0
' sir ' @entity130 ( left ) was @entity128 's no 2 at @entity61 and the pair were former team - mates at the @entity137 @entity138 , who is currently part of the @entity141 backroom staff at the @entity142 , wants to return to the @entity143 and find a job in management			2
the 39 - year - old former @entity147 captain and @entity55 and @entity103 centre - half is also on the lookout for any outstanding players at the tournament in his role as an ambassador for @entity154 , the new global football networking community , which amongst other things offers a job board for players and other sectors of the football business around the world			2
@entity138 , pictured during his @entity103 pomp in 2007 , is looking to return to the @entity143 in management @entity163 @entity0 fans , never shy to rant on social media , were up in arms last week after @entity167 castigated @entity169 players for their over the top celebrations after winning at @entity100 last sunday , then sneered at some of them posting selfies as the celebrations went on in the dressing room			2
and let ’s be clear			0
he was n’t only picking on @entity0 players			2
he just used the situation at the @entity181 to highlight what has become a growing and vulgar trend of uber - celebration at the end of many @entity31 games			1
as he pointed out @entity0 's 2 - 0 win was impressive but was not exactly @entity189 going up against @entity190 knocking them out of the @entity52			1
in contrast look how @entity193 players conducted their celebrations after their @entity196 2 - 0 win at @entity100			0
they were obviously elated but did not ( on the pitch at least ) make muppets of themselves			0
@entity199 shared this image on social media after @entity0 beat @entity100 2 - 0 at the @entity202 the @entity169 players hail the travelling support after an impressive result at the @entity202 @entity206 has yet to put his foot on the gas since returning to @entity55 from @entity43 on loan this season			1
but he knows about the fast lane when it comes cars			0
parked in the driveway of his @entity216 commuter belt mansion , which he shares with family members , are three motors right out of @entity220			0
front of the grid is a white @entity223 , followed by a @entity224 and a top of the range mercedes			0
but new @entity55 boss @entity72 has told @entity227 he must prove that as a player he is top marque like those cars			0
it was not an act of giant killing			0
nor was it a result that delivered silverware			0
it was a case of a team that should be in the title running beating another rival away			0
a job well done by the @entity169 in the middle of a league campaign			0
possibly a pivotal three points			0
but with half the season still to go it defined nothing apart from that despite their extra wealth @entity100 are a long way from being @entity98			0
and @entity0 when they are in the right mood are a top team			2
given they are eight in @entity92 football ’s rich list , compared to @entity100 ’s sixth they are hardly poor relations either			0
yes , they were entitled to feel well satisfied ; exhilarated even , but the almost hysterical out pouring of emotion was a joke			0
as @entity167 said , save the high fives and hugs , the photos and the video shoots for a day when a trophy is lifted			2
and he will say the same about his former team @entity102 and other teams who more and more indulge in celebrating every win as if they have won the @entity52			2
what is becoming a @entity270 in top level football is embarrassing			0
@entity193 players handled their dramatic @entity196 win at @entity100 with dignity @entity102 celebrate wrapping up the @entity276 title at @entity277 in 1986 btw a teeth whitening dentist now makes regular visits to @entity101 ’s @entity281 training ground			2
i sense the magic of the @entity196 is coming back and actually the fact that so many matches are screened live over the course of the weekend is helping not hindering			0
witness the wild results in the fourth round thus far at @entity277 , the @entity202 , @entity289 's and @entity137			2
and was n’t it great to see humble @entity291 hold @entity43 to a goalless draw on friday ? and in the third round @entity87 and @entity104 played out a different sort of drama when they went toe - to - toe in their replay with the @entity87 winning 9 - 8 on penalties			1
@entity291 fans celebrate their magnificent display against @entity43 to earn a money - spinning @entity196 replay @entity302 threw his gloves off in the run - up and coolly slotted home to seal @entity87 's place in the fourth round it was made all the more memorable by the fact that the winning penalty was scored by @entity87 keeper @entity302 after his counterpart @entity310 had missed			1
keepers taking penalties is not that unusual but going head to for the decisive kick did seem rather unique and certainly added a splash of colour to the competition			0
and by the way the first time a keeper took a penalty in a shoot out in a meaningful match in @entity324 football was back in the 1974 @entity326 when @entity327 ran out of players and keeper @entity329 stepped to take one against @entity102 ’s @entity330 and fired it high and wide			1
the pair then embraced and @entity329 suggested it was now @entity333 's turn			2
but the former @entity335 keeper declined and so up stepped veteran @entity336 to smash home the winner			0
@entity339 under the impressive @entity340 have been flying in the championship and could well get promotion to the @entity31			2
what an achievement that would be			0
so it would be no surprise if the @entity347 win at struggling @entity50			0
but i see @entity0 winning at @entity349 and @entity87 at @entity350			1
on monday @entity353 in the play off places of @entity352 can give @entity79 a fright			0
so @entity0 and @entity87 win			1
@entity353 and @entity79 draw .			0

@entity0 have agreed a deal in principle to sign @entity5 's @entity3
that will end their interest in @entity11 , who may or may not want to leave @entity38
his £ 25m price *tag* is too high for @entity0 *...* and @entity43 could pounce
@entity57 is said to be unhappy at @entity59 and @entity31 clubs are *circling*
@entity115 will sign a *bumper* new deal to keep him at @entity102
@entity87 , the world 's 21st richest club , hope to lure @entity93
