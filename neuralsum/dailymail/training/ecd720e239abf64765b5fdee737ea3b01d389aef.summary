@entity7 said : ‘ he arrived on wednesday and he ’s happy and confident of course because he scored two goals for @entity15 in a very important game and that can only boost his confidence			2
' @entity0 is young , strong and a great finisher			1
‘ when you analyse his game you think he has the qualities to play through the middle			0
at @entity5 , where you had many big stars , and he is a player who is very versatile , he had to make room sometimes for players to play through the middle			2
@entity0 completed his move from @entity5 to @entity2 on transfer deadline day @entity97 limped off injured for @entity98 in their 2 - 1 @entity20 qualifier win at @entity101 ' but if you analyse in an objective way his qualities , i think he has the perfect style to play through the middle			1
’ @entity7 added : ‘ he has been questioned about that ( his finishing ) , but the second goal ( for @entity15 ) gives you a good answer			2
’ ' @entity0 's best position is through the middle			2
he is happy and confident ' @entity7 has drawn criticism in some quarters for being in @entity115 on deadline day , but he said : ‘ if i had not travelled that day , @entity0 would not be here			1

i will tell you that story one day but that 's the truth			2
we are in 2014 and you can always be in touch with everybody even when you travel			0
the advantage of that day was i had to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and i was available the whole day			0
’ when asked if sir @entity133 would have sanctioned such a deal , @entity7 joked : ‘ you should ask him			0
i met him by coincidence on tuesday and wednesday and i would like to keep that conversation to myself ! ’ @entity7 added : ‘ we sold @entity137 to @entity5 so that 's a reciprocity that happened there			1
@entity7 revealed that @entity140 is ' two to three weeks ' away from being fully fit per @entity141 ( left ) takes on @entity122 during @entity2 training on wednesday ' when they bought ( @entity145 ) @entity145 they had to let somebody go and i was not aware at the start when i heard that he ( @entity0 ) could be available			1
it was quick because it was on the last day of the transfer window and i had no hesitation to do it			0
’ @entity2 expect to have @entity97 fit to face @entity10 on saturday despite injuring his ankle for @entity98 against @entity101			1

i have to admit i thought the @entity0 sale was a strange one , but that ’s just me			0
‘ of all the prices paid this summer , there are right backs and left - backs galore who have been bought for £ 14m , £ 15m , £ 16m ? ‘ how have @entity2 got him [ @entity0 ] for £ 16m ? i ca n’t work it out			1
it has helped out a competitor because @entity2 are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly			0
