a study released wednesday by a respected @entity1 think tank asserts that proposals to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 could cut @entity1 drug cartels ' earnings from traffic to the @entity12 by as much as 30 per cent			1
opponents questioned some of the study 's assumptions , saying the proposals could also offer new opportunities for cartels to operate inside the @entity12 and replace any profit lost to a drop in international smuggling			2
the ballot measures to be decided on november 6 would allow adults to possess small amounts of pot under a regimen of state regulation and taxation			2
three states have ballot proposals to legalize the recreational use of marijuana polls have shown tight races in @entity8 and @entity6 , with @entity8 's measure appearing to have the best chance of passing			1
@entity7 's measure , which would impose the fewest regulations , does not appear likely to pass			0
the study by the @entity42 , ‘ if our neighbors legalize , ’ assumes that legalization in any state would allow growers there to produce marijuana relatively cheaply and create an illicit flow to other states , where the drug could be made available at cheaper prices and higher quality than @entity1 marijuana smuggled across the international border			1
the report , based on previous studies by @entity12 experts including those at the @entity60 , assumes that @entity1 cartels earn more than $ 6 billion a year from drug smuggling to the @entity12 it calculates the hypothetical , post-legalization price of marijuana produced in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity6 and sold within those states and smuggled to other states			1
it then assumes that purchasers around the @entity12 will choose domestic marijuana when it is sold cheaper than the current price of @entity1 marijuana			0
across the border : a @entity1 report assumes that legalization in any state would facilitate an illicit flow of marijuana to other states			0
the drug could be available for cheaper than @entity1 marijuana smuggled across the border that choice will lead to a loss of $ 1.425 billion to the cartels if @entity6 legalizes , $ 1.372 billion if @entity8 approves the ballot measure , and $ 1.839 billion if @entity7 votes yes , the study says			1
the only looks at the effects of legalization in individual states , and does not calculate what would happen if more than one legalized marijuana			0
opponents of the ballot measures said the study bolsters one of their principal objections , that it will turn any state with legal marijuana into a producer for the rest of the country			1
they said , however , that they did not believe that production will rob the cartels of significant profits , saying instead that they thought @entity1 drug lords would instead try to participate in legal production inside the @entity12 ‘ if i were a cartel member and i knew @entity6 and @entity8 had it legal , i 'd get a couple front people and do my business out of those states			1
why would i not ? ’ said @entity110 , head of the @entity112 , a government agency that coordinates anti-drug efforts by local , state and federal agencies in four western states			0
the @entity1 government has said that drug legalization in some @entity12 states could make it harder to prosecute growers and dealers in @entity1 , because they would be producing a product potentially destined for a place where it is legal			0
@entity129 , an author of the study and a former high - ranking officer in @entity1 's domestic intelligence service , acknowledged that the study made a series of assumptions that may not be prove to be true , including the assumption that the @entity12 federal government would not aggressively investigate and prosecute movement of marijuana out of a state where it 's legal			0
a post-legalization federal crackdown could make domestically grown marijuana uncompetitive with @entity1 pot in many states , he said , meaning cartels would see less of a cut in profits			2
‘ diversion is a problem we 'll continue to have to monitor , ’ said @entity149 , campaign manager with @entity8 , the group pushing @entity140 's legalization measure			0
‘ but the question is to the extent that is happening , is it better that the money is going to licensed , regulated businesses instead of going to @entity1 ? ’ a @entity60 study of a proposal to legalize marijuana in @entity163 in 2010 asserted that could cut cartel drug income by 20 percent .			2

@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 all have ballot proposals that would legalize recreational use of the drug
@entity42 says even if one of the measures passed , it could rob the cartels of $ 1.4 to $ *1.8billion* in smuggling profits
study *argues* large amounts of marijuana produced in legalized states would be *exported* to the rest of the country , where it remains *illegal*
