the @entity17 reports that @entity19 's family was only informed of @entity16 ' release yesterday			1
mother @entity0 , who has campaigned widely since the death of her son , was said to be ' shocked '			2
she told the paper : ' i have been told that the terms of his parole mean that he must not enter @entity31			0
but the probation service did n't monitor him properly last time so i have no faith in their ability to do that now			0

' @entity19 's father @entity39 is convinced that @entity40 will re-offend , a fried of his told @entity17 , adding that the family had not been given updates on the plans to release the killer			1

@entity16 and classmate @entity61 were 10 when they abducted the two - year - old from a shopping centre in @entity64 , @entity31 , in february 1993 , and tortured and murdered him			2
they were given life sentences for the crime , but released on licence in 2001 with new identities , despite public opposition			1

chilling : @entity84 footage showed @entity85 and @entity61 leading young @entity86 away by the hand in a @entity64 shopping centre @entity0 was first released from prison in 2001 , at the age of 18 , and given a new identity to protect him from the risk of vigilante attacks			1
at the time , a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences			0
however , he developed drinking and drugs problems , and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer			0
when a probation officer visited his home in @entity105 to discuss his fears that he could be in danger , he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer			0

it is said to have taken officials two months to prepare his new identity			0
@entity16 was first given a new identity when he and @entity61 were sent to a young offenders ' institution for murdering the toddler			1
a second new identity was created for him when he was released in 2001 , and he was given a third identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images			1
each change of identity is believed to cost taxpayers around £ 250,000 , with the total bill for @entity16 therefore reaching £ 1million with his latest release			2
a @entity151 spokesman said : ' we do not comment on individual offenders			0
' the re-release of life licensed offenders is directed by the independent @entity156 once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community			2

he was released from life sentence for brutal murder of the toddler in 2001
but was locked up again three years ago after being caught with child porn
