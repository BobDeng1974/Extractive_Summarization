by @entity0 and @entity1 new deal : @entity3 , pictured on his way to the @entity5 , has reportedly been handed a new three year contract with the @entity7 worth £ 12million , despite anger at his n - word controversy @entity3 could be in line for a new £ 12million deal with the @entity7 despite being accused of a string of racist gaffes , it has emerged			1
the presenter is said to be in talks over three more years of @entity17 , just weeks after he sparked outrage over his use of the word ‘ n * * * * * ’ in a tv out - take			1
in the clip , @entity3 can be seen swinging a finger between two cars while reciting the rhyme : ‘ @entity28 ’ before mumbling what sounded like ‘ catch a n * * * * * by his toe ’			2
reacting to its publication , @entity3 said he was ‘ mortified ’ and ‘ horrified ’ when he realised it ‘ did appear that i ’d actually used the word i was trying to obscure ’			1
he added : ‘ please be assured i did everything in my power to not use that word , and i ’m sitting here , begging your forgiveness for the fact that obviously my efforts were n’t quite good enough			0
’ @entity3 , 54 , has since claimed to have been warned that he is ‘ drinking in the last chance saloon ’ by the @entity7			2
despite the row , a @entity7 source yesterday confirmed negotiations were still taking place about his new contract			0
' there is no question of @entity3 ’s deal not being renewed , ' a @entity7 source told the @entity50			1
' it is being worked on right now			0
the top executives want him signed up as soon as possible			0
' it is thought the new deal – reported to be as high as £ 12million – would include a £ 3million annual salary from @entity57 , while an additional £ 1million would come from the licence fee for each of the three years from 2015 to 2018			1
the nursery rhyme row followed an incident in march , when @entity3 joked that a bridge with an @entity64 walking across it had ‘ a slope on it ’			2
at the time he was defended by @entity17 producer @entity68 , who claimed the presenter was unaware ‘ slope ’ was an offensive term for @entity71			1
@entity74 users vented their anger , with one accusing the @entity7 of giving @entity3 special treatment			2
‘ @entity3 at @entity7 proves it is ok to be racist as long as you make lots of money , ’ they wrote			1
’ @entity3 's co-presenters @entity85 , 44 , and @entity84 , 51 , who were recently pictured filming with @entity3 in @entity94 , are also believed to have been offered new deals			1
earlier this month it was reported that director of television @entity96 had allegedly wanted to sack @entity3 , but he was saved by @entity7 director general @entity98 following a lengthy meeting over the scandal			2
the controversial decision will save the corporation millions as the hit show is said to earn in excess of £ 150million a year in revenue - more than any other @entity7 show			2
top gear is regularly watched by more than five million @entity109 viewers , with more tuning in on the broadcaster 's @entity111 service			0
it is also shown in the @entity114 , @entity115 and across @entity116 , and it has been estimated that the show is watched by 350 million viewers in 170 countries every week			0
in 2012 , @entity57 paid £ 8.4 million for @entity3 ’s stake in a joint venture which had owned the commercial rights to @entity17			1
previously @entity3 received dividends as a co-owner of the company , but he now is understood to receive an annual seven - figure fee from @entity57 , while the corporation owns the rights to the @entity17 brand			1
@entity3 's current deal is thought to be worth around £ 1million a year for his work as a presenter			1
after details of the ' n - word ' footage emerged an online petition calling for him to be sacked reached more than 1,000 signatures , and @entity138 figures including deputy leader @entity139 and mp @entity140 called for him to go			1
' anybody who uses the n - word in public or private in whatever context has no place in the @entity7 , ' ms @entity139 wrote on @entity74			1
claims : news of his new contract comes after @entity3 faced calls for him to be sacked after he allegedly used the n - word during an un-aired @entity17 outtake remorse : @entity3 issued an apology in which he ' begged for forgiveness ' and said he was ' mortified ' at the footage but education secretary @entity158 urged the @entity7 not to axe @entity3 because he had been ' clear in his apology '			1
@entity3 then declared the corporation had forced him to apologise when he did not want to			0
he said he will be sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again , admitting ' not even the angel gabriel ' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy			2
but the presenter compared his apology to saying sorry for starting the @entity167 civil war because they were both things he had not done			0
' i 've been told by the @entity7 that if i make one more offensive remark , anywhere , at any time , i will be sacked , ' he wrote			0
broadcast : the controversy came just weeks after he referred to an @entity64 man as a ' slope ' during an episode of @entity17 ' and even the angel @entity178 would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head			0
' it 's inevitable that one day , someone , somewhere will say that i 've offended them , and that will be that			0
' he also wrote : ' happily , the @entity7 had a plan			0
unfortunately , it was n't a very good one			0
' an apology is a good idea if you 've just spilled some beer down someone 's shirt ... but saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all , and hoping the story would die down as a result ? '			0
