by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 17:45 est , 18 december 2012 if you feel guilty about eating a ready meal while watching tv chefs making something from scratch , do n’t worry – your food ’s probably healthier than theirs			1
researchers say programmes from the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 should carry health warnings or even be shown after the watershed , because the recipes contain hundreds more calories than tv dinners			1
the claim comes after @entity19 and @entity20 examined the top five books by tv chefs on @entity23 in december 2010 : @entity25 by @entity26 , kitchen by @entity12 , @entity11 ’s @entity24 by @entity28			2
good for you : the nutritional value of meals from books by celebrity chefs including @entity12 , left , and @entity28 , right , were compared to supermarket ready meals nutrition : offerings by chefs including @entity11 were said to be ' less healthy ' than the supermarket ready meals after selecting 100 random recipes from them , they then compared the nutritional content with 100 own - brand ready meals from @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 ’s			1
the chefs ’ offerings were ‘ less healthy ’ than ready meals and contained ‘ significantly more ’ fat , saturated fat and protein and less fibre per portion , the study found			1
on average , the celebrity recipes contained 2,530 calories per portion , compared with 2,067 in the ready meals			1
none of the meals from either group met all of the @entity63 ’s nutritional recommendations for a balanced healthy meal			1
professor @entity65 , whose study was published on the @entity68 website , said : ‘ children are subject to a 9pm watershed that restricts advertising of foods classified as high in fat , salt and sugar , and perhaps we should be thinking of similar restrictions			0
‘ there is certainly a case for providing nutritional information at the bottom of the screen and possibly traffic light warnings , as well as more information in cookbooks			0
’ @entity86 - fingered : even @entity26 's meals was included in the study the @entity89 still spends £ 2.5billion a year on ready meals , despite their unhealthy reputation			1
prof @entity65 said : ‘ there ’s nothing wrong with some of these recipes as an occasional treat but people need to be made aware ’ he added			0
a spokesman for @entity11 said ‘ we welcome any research which raises debate on these issues and in fact @entity104 ’s most recent book , 15 minute meals , does contain calorie content and nutritional information per serving for every dish			2
‘ we will soon also be re-launching the @entity11 website with nutritional information on the recipes			0
however , we would regard the key issue to be food education so that people are aware of which foods are for every day and which are treats to be enjoyed occasionally			0
’ a spokeswoman for @entity28 said ‘ some of the recipes in @entity28 ’s book are healthy , some not quite so much so			2
‘ there are plenty of salads , soups and light meals as well as the richer dishes			0
‘ her books and shows to date have n’t been about healthy eating , they are about cooking			0
however , funnily enough , the topic of her next series and book specifically addresses healthy eating			0

health warnings should be on cooking programmes , say researchers
study compared nutritional content of chefs ' recipes and ready meals
no meal met all of @entity63 ’s recommendations for a balanced healthy meal
