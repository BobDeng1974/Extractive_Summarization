chancellor @entity0 has been accused of rushing through the changes ahead of the election hundreds of thousands of savers face pensions chaos because radical new reforms are being implemented too quickly , experts warned yesterday			1
chancellor @entity0 was accused of rushing through the changes ahead of the election			1
savers aged 55 or over will be allowed to cash in their entire pension pot and invest it how they please from april 6			1
the move is designed to give them more freedom by ensuring they are no longer forced to buy a poor value annuity locking them into a meagre income for the rest of their lives			0
but with less than two months before the biggest overhaul of personal pensions in a century , there are growing fears that savers and insurance firms will not be ready for the deadline			1
experts fear many savers will squander their nest eggs , while others wanting to take advantage of the changes will be turned down by their pensions firm			1
yesterday the boss of one of the @entity38 's biggest insurance companies criticised ministers for setting an ' incredibly aggressive timetable ' and warned it could lead to savers making ' poor decisions ' with their money			1
@entity45 of @entity46 said the @entity47 had ' plucked this april deadline out of the air '			1
he added : ' we wholeheartedly support the policy objective but customers are not ready for the new pension freedoms , which have been thrown into place in an entirely unrealistic timescale			1
' i fear that many will make the wrong , often irrecoverable decisions about their retirement and this will result in some very poor outcomes			0
firms are still waiting for the @entity69 to publish rules stipulating the guidance they should be giving to those wanting to exploit the pensions freedoms			1
@entity75 , the boss of financial adviser @entity76 , called the preparations ' alarmingly chaotic ' and accused the government of a ' cynical ploy ' to win votes ahead of may 's election			2
he said firms will struggle to update their computer systems in time , meaning thousands wanting to cash in their pots will not be allowed to do so			1
experts fear many savers will squander their nest eggs , while others wanting to take advantage of the changes will be turned down by their pensions firm ' it seems as though this monumental shake - up of @entity38 's pension landscape is being pushed through to win support from the influential over- 55 demographic ahead of the forthcoming general election , ' he added			1
under the changes , savers will be able to cash in a quarter of their pension pot tax free – as they can do now			2
but if they cash in the rest , it will be added to their taxable income for the year – meaning they could lose up to 45 per cent of it in tax			0
government adviser dr @entity111 rejected criticism from insurers , saying : ' they have had plenty of time and should stop complaining			0
' a @entity118 spokesman said : ' the government believes people who have worked hard and saved all their lives should have the freedom to decide how to use their savings			0
' act now or risk a fiasco , @entity126 analysis april 6 , 2015 , is supposed to be the day pensions receive the biggest shake - up in generations			2
it is the date when everyone retiring should be handed the power to do whatever they want with their nest eggs			1
but those hoping to draw down cash from their company pension are facing the stark prospect that they will be refused			0
anyone with a private scheme could be forced to move their entire pension to a different company			0
insurance and investment companies wo n’t be ready , and only a few will be able to offer the freedoms that have been promised			1
it threatens to bring confusion and frustration for millions of retirees			0
insurers blame the government and regulators for failing to help them implement new rules			0
those hoping to draw down cash from their company pension are facing the stark prospect that they will be refused and on this occasion they seem justified in passing the buck			0
they ’ve had less than a year to overhaul a system that has been working in the same way for decades – and largely they have had to do it in the dark			0
an act of @entity173 for pension schemes has not been passed into law yet			0
only last week did the @entity65 regulator outline how it will be monitoring firms , and even then in the vaguest terms			2
savers retiring up to six months from now are already receiving letters from insurers which should be pointing them in the direction of a new free guidance service			2
but the website for this was only launched on wednesday , and there is still no phone number pensioners can call for help			0
just 300 staff will be on hand to provide this service			0
and there have been suggestions that helpers giving face - to - face advice will be inexperienced – if they are ready at all			1
insurance bosses say they have been pleading with policy - makers for more details on how to implement the rules , but that this has not been forthcoming			2
some firms have attempted to launch new types of pensions which will allow people to keep their money invested and pay an income , but also take chunks of their savings when they want			1
however , these are largely untested			0
others have pulled the plug on new schemes because they have found them to be unworkable			0
it ’s a realistic possibility that it will be 2016 before most savers are able to benefit from the pension freedoms			2
unless regulators and policy - makers act swiftly , instead of pension freedoms we ’ll have a pensions fiasco			2
and it will leave thousands of savers frustrated , unable to get help , and at risk of making a catastrophic and irreversible mistake with their retirement savings .			1
