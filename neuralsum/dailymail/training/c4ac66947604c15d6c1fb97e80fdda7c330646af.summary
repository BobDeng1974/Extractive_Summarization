by @entity0 the way aviation authorities assess the risks of flying in dangerous areas has been slammed as ' not good enough ' by the @entity7 pilots ' organisation @entity8			1
in the wake of the @entity12 tragedy , the group has claimed that risk assessments by aviation authorities and airlines can create ' an illusion of safety ' and said they are vulnerable to commercial pressure			1
@entity8 's general secretary @entity19 called for a uniform approach on safety across the board ' not one that is decided in secret '			1
tragedy : the @entity7 pilots ' association @entity8 has hit out at safety decisions following the @entity12 disaster danger zones : @entity29 paths on radar changed over @entity31 in the @entity32 , after the downing of @entity34 @entity12 the comments come after it was revealed that although airlines are no longer flying over @entity32 , there have been instances since last week 's crash where passenger planes have flown over the war - torn areas of northern @entity44 and @entity45			1
strong words : @entity8 general secretary @entity19 claimed the way safety decisions are made is ' not good enough ' mr @entity19 said it was important to look at ' failures ' that led to the @entity52 disaster			1
some @entity54 and @entity55 carriers , including the @entity7 's @entity56 , are not flying to @entity57 today after a rocket landed near @entity60 airport			2
@entity8 today called for global leadership from the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) in all operations in or over areas of hostility			0
@entity8 said that although @entity62 is the @entity68 body responsible for co-ordinating the safety and order of global aviation , maybe it should have a greater leadership role and strengthened powers to go with that responsibility			1
mr @entity19 said : ' individual pilots looking at their flight plans need to have absolute confidence that the right calls are being made			2
the process behind the choice of airspace routing is based on a risk assessment ; both by a country 's national aviation security services in the advice that they give to their airlines , and by the airline in how they assess this advice			0
' this risk assessment approach can give an illusion of safety but it is in fact vulnerable to all sorts of influences including commercial pressure and so it is not surprising to us that there are differences in the way that this risk is assessed by different airlines			2
' he went on : ' that is not good enough			0
passengers and pilots want a uniform level of safety , not one that is decided in secret			1
paying tribute : flowers have been laid outside the @entity115 in @entity116 to remember those lost on flight @entity12 ' while the ultimate responsibility of last week 's murders lies with the people who apparently directed a missile at a peaceful civil airliner , this should not prevent us looking at the failures that led to that outcome ; failures that could easily be repeated in other areas of conflict			2
' mr @entity19 added : ' @entity62 's purpose should be to lead where national authorities can not and it should have the tools to do that			0
the problem of the absence of a clear international co-ordination to avoid operations above eastern @entity32 has now become tragically obvious and to avoid a repeat @entity62 should be better resourced and enabled to declare airspace unsafe			0
' @entity62 also needs to reflect on its own rules of membership			0
participating states enjoy privileges such as free movement , but with that comes responsibility			0
if a state does not live up to that responsibility , such as sharing of information and allowing full and free access to accident investigation , then membership and privileges should be reconsidered			0

@entity7 pilots ' association @entity8 said a uniform approach to safety is needed
@entity8 *accused* safety decisions of being made ' in secret '
claimed commercial pressures influenced decisions about flight routes
aviation *industry* needs to look at ' failures ' following @entity12 tragedy
