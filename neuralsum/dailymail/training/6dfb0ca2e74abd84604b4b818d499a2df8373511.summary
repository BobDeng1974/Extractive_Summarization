it is one of the most iconic beat - em - ups ever created			1
and now , after laying dormant for years , @entity3 is ready to explode on to the next - generation @entity4			1
but why did we have to wait so long ? @entity6 talks to @entity7 , a producer at @entity8			2
what efforts have been made to ensure this version of @entity3 remains faithful to the original ? @entity12 : from the very beginning staying faithful to the original games has been a top priority in development			2
it 's tricky , especially after almost two decades to bring a franchise back			1
you need to stay true to the original , but you also need to update it into a modern title			2
killer instinct was a definitive fighting game back in the 1990 's			1
it 's style , visuals and gameplay were very unique			1
brutal : with a classic cast , huge combos and an awesome soundtrack , @entity28 is shaping nicely things such as the wild , diverse cast of characters , massive combos , combo breakers and the iconic announcer were unique to @entity28 and made it a blast to play			2
it was key to us to bring all of those elements back and judging by the response we 've been pretty successful so far			2
we 've got the classic cast , incredible combos , combo breakers , an awesome soundtrack and we even brought back the original announcer from the previous games			0
however , while the visual style and other aesthetics were very much associated with that time , fighting game mechanics have come a long way in the intervening years			0
we also knew it was really important to update @entity3 as a modern fighting game for a next gen console			0
we updated the visuals and style and expanded upon the unique combat system			1
in addition to combo breakers , we 've added counter breakers , which break combo breakers , shadow counters , combo lockouts and more			0
a host of new features and systems that not only make it a singular fighting game experience , but also really hype and exciting one			0
are there any new characters you can talk about ? @entity12 : we 've been steadily announcing characters since our @entity77 announcement			2
the latest two are @entity79 and the classic character , @entity81			1
@entity79 is a whole new addition to the @entity3 franchise			1
we thought it was really important if we were going to create a new game that we expand the @entity3 universe and add a new character in our initial release			0
we worked really hard to make sure she fit thematically within @entity28 , but also that she offered something new in terms of gameplay that was different from any characters in our opening roster , and also different from any other @entity28 character in the original titles as well			2
thematically we definitely think @entity79 fits within the @entity3 universe			1
she 's got a very cool spider motif and abilities			1
this is reflected in her arena as well , with the spiders , webs , captured items and other elements			0
we 'll be revealing more about her story later , but she 's the leader of a clan of assassins and they 're targeting other @entity3 characters			1
this will tie into the overall story in a cool way			0
ambitious : @entity8 hopes that @entity28 's matchmaking will be super-fast and as seamless as possible in terms of gameplay she 's unique in that she has great control of space , high mobility and really excels in the air combat			1
she has a double jump , which she can use to modulate her attack and defense , air daggers with special properties and a fast wall bound that she can use to confuse and set up cool attack patterns			0
she 's unique in the roster in terms of these kinds of abilities and she 's tons of fun to play			1
as for @entity81 we 'll be revealing more info about her soon			1
we were super excited to announce such an iconic character and ca n't wait to show more			0
will there be any extra downloadable content aside from the characters themselves ? @entity12 : yes definitely ! and that 's a big part of how we 're launching the game and updating it			1
in addition to characters players can also download alternate costumes for each character and accessories for each character 's base costume and their alternate costumes			1
the cool thing about the accessories is that they 're freely interchangeable with each other , so you can mix and match to create unique looks for characters			2
in addition to these types of downloadable content we will also be updating the game and releasing new features for the game post launch			1
we 're envisioning the @entity3 as more like a service where we want to continually update the game and engage with the community to help guide what those updates will be			0
we want to keep releasing content as long as players keep playing			2
how has development benefited from being an @entity4 title ? was there ever consideration to make this a 360 title ? @entity12 : @entity4 has several new features that enhance the experience for games on the console in really compelling ways			1
outside of enhanced next gen graphics , in @entity3 we 're using the @entity4 's capabilities for enhanced matchmaking			1
our goal is to make matchmaking as fast , seamless and ubiquitous as possible			2
we want players to be able to find matches throughout the experience in the game , not just when they 're in online mode			0
when a match is found we want players to be able to jump into the match from wherever they are , whether they 're in practice mode , training mode or any single player mode			0
we also want players to be able to search for matches even during an active multiplayer match			0
where ever you are we want you to be able to get some online competition going			0
worth the wait : but sadly ps4 owners and those opting to stay with current gen wo n't be able to play it another very cool feature unique to @entity4 is how it can map controllers and settings to individual players			1
it will remember the controller button mapping and settings for an individual as soon as they pick up the controller			0
for a fighting game this is really cool			0
you often have several friends over playing at the same time and swapping controllers back and forth			0
automatically switching button mapping when a new player picks up the controller makes the hot swap way faster and seamless			0
this is great for any game , but especially a fighting game where players have their favourite button settings			0
in terms of the target console , @entity3 is definitely an @entity4 title			1
we have no plans for other versions to announce			0
follow us on @entity242 : @ @entity243 and on @entity244 : @entity245			0

next - generation graphics and *upgraded* combat system
new characters , such as @entity79 and @entity81 - each with their own abilities
