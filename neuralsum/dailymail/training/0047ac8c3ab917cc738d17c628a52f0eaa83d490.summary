@entity0 analyses what we learned from the latest round of fixtures in the @entity5 and @entity6 during the festive period : 1			2
while virtually every other manager moaned about the @entity11 fixture list , @entity8 proved it is possible to play two games in 48 hours and not get too tired			1
winger @entity14 had covered more ground than any other @entity5 player on @entity17 when he ran 8.1 miles against @entity18 , and he matched that distance exactly at @entity20 with his energy late in the game a key factor in the comeback from 2 - 0 down			1
but @entity26 ’s whole team followed those energy levels			2
an unchanged side ran 74.5 miles collectively at the @entity29 , further than the 74.2 they achieved in the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity18			1
@entity14 ( left ) ran 8.1 miles twice in two days as @entity26 's ( right ) side drew with @entity20 2			1
@entity33 has emerged as @entity35 ’s penalty expert after slotting away his third spot kick in five matches			2
at the age of 30 the @entity39 midfielder seems to have come to spot - kick duties late in his career			1
until he got the first of this batch – at @entity45 – he had never previously scored from the spot for the @entity47 in more than two seasons			0
there are no penalties listed among his goals in @entity39 for @entity52 and @entity53 , either			0
@entity33 capped an impressive performance for @entity35 against @entity55 by scoring a penalty 3			0
@entity58 ’s return to @entity59 was said to be one of the reasons @entity62 fell out with chairman @entity63 before walking out before the start of the season			1
@entity63 , who wanted @entity66 back from @entity67 , got his way by bringing in the 22 - year - old on loan after @entity62 had left			1
it has n’t been a success			0
@entity66 scored on his second debut , but since then has only twice completed 90 minutes			0
he was restored to the starting line - up by caretaker @entity75 for the 0 - 0 draw at @entity77 , but was subbed again after little more than an hour having had only one shot at goal			1
@entity77 defender @entity80 ( left ) holds off @entity58 ( right ) of @entity59 4			1
@entity81 continues to set the standard for creative midfield play			0
his delicious pass off the outside of his foot for @entity87 to score @entity89 ’s goal at @entity90 was his 13th assist of the season			0
that ’s the same number that @entity93 achieved all last season for @entity18 to be the best provider of the 2013 - 14 campaign			1
@entity81 has already provided 13 assists for his @entity89 team - mates so far this season 5			1
mystery continues to surround the games that top referee @entity101 is given to control			0
the 39 - year - old @entity103 official , recently banned as a punishment for driving away from a game at @entity106 in his own car because he wanted to dash to see a pop concert , was back at @entity109 again for the @entity17 game with @entity20			1
but on sunday he was demoted to @entity111 to take charge of @entity114 ’s 0 - 0 draw with @entity115			1
meanwhile @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 all took charge of two @entity5 games in 48 hours			0
@entity101 refereed @entity20 's win at @entity106 on @entity17 , before dropping to @entity111 on sunday 6			1
former @entity125 star @entity124 has hit all the headlines but it is @entity128 who is the unsung hero of @entity45 ’s midfield			0
the 26 - year - old @entity131 was his side ’s top passer in the 2 - 0 win over @entity106 as well as the @entity17 victory at @entity135			1
@entity128 and skipper @entity136 are the only two players to have been picked by boss @entity138 for every minute of every @entity5 game			1
@entity128 ( centre ) has been the unsung hero so far for @entity45 in the @entity5 this season 7			0
@entity141 will send @entity142 to the @entity143 in january with fingers crossed that he comes back without any further injury troubles			0
the @entity147 midfielder has finally shaken off the hamstring issues which have affected him all season and was a key man in the 3 - 2 win over @entity135			2
the 28 - year - old made one goal , was involved in the build - up to another and set up three more chances			2
@entity141 's @entity142 ( right ) has recovered from hamstring issues but is off to the @entity143 8			2
@entity157 has struggled for first team chances under @entity159 – the 0 - 0 draw with @entity67 was only his second @entity5 start all season			1
the @entity163 winger did his best to grab the chance , covering 395 metres at sprinting speed , despite getting taken off 11 minutes from the end the most of any player on display at @entity170			0
sadly there was n’t enough end product to it			0
he managed two long range shots which were easily saved , but failed to set up a chance for any of his team mates			2
@entity157 ( right ) managed two shots for @entity180 before being substituted after 79 minutes 9			1
@entity181 has transformed @entity182 since taking charge at the end of october following the humiliation of an 8 - 0 home defeat by @entity187			2
the 3 - 1 win at @entity189 took the former @entity191 boss to 20 points from his first ten matches			2
@entity195 striker @entity194 has benefited more than most from the added confidence – he ’s got four goals in the last six games			0
@entity194 ( left ) has flourished under the guidance of new @entity182 manager @entity181 10			0
for all that players and managers argue about the merits of a winter break , fans love the @entity11 programme			0
an average of 36,000 went to @entity5 games over @entity17 and sunday , while the figure was more than 20,000 in the @entity209 , above 7,000 in @entity210 , and 5,600 in @entity111 .			0

@entity8 's starting line - up was unchanged for the game at @entity20
@entity58 's return to the @entity59 line - up failed to impress
@entity157 also did not *inspire* in a rare start for @entity180
