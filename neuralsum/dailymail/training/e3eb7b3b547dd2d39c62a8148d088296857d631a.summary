by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:15 est , 29 december 2012 updated : 16:59 est , 31 december 2012 few gifts could be more precious than the one @entity3 gave to his wife @entity4 this @entity5			1
when cystic fibrosis sufferer @entity4 was told her kidneys were failing and that her only chance of survival was a transplant , her devoted husband stepped in without hesitation to offer one of his own organs			2
it was a touching gesture of love and one @entity3 was happy to make after 15 years of marriage to his childhood sweetheart			1
gift of life : husband @entity22 was a donor for his wife @entity4 's kidney transplant just before @entity5 but what makes his sacrifice all the more remarkable is that , in similarly desperate circumstances 13 years ago , @entity3 also gave @entity4 a portion of one of his lungs			1
these two inspiring deeds are now thought to represent a world first			2
doctors and transplant experts say there are no known cases in which a living donor has given up two organs			2
this is due to the serious risks of such surgery			2
the fact that the recipient in both case was @entity3 's own wife makes the story even more extraordinary – especially considering that it is highly unusual for a husband to be able to donate to his spouse , as finding a suitable match for a transplant is notoriously difficult			1
world class treatment : @entity4 received her transplant at @entity53 in @entity54 the latest successful operation took place at @entity53 in @entity54 on december 12 and the couple were back at their £ 500,000 home in @entity60 , @entity61 , in time for @entity5			2
@entity3 , 39 , an accountant for bank @entity62 , told @entity64 : ' they say marriage is in sickness and in health			1
when i married @entity4 i knew it would n't be easy and that she might die without a transplant			2
when it came to me being a live donor , i did n't hesitate for a second			2
' i was prepared to make the sacrifice that could have seen us both lose our lives			2
i could n't stand by and watch @entity4 die for want of a lung donor			1
' and when it turned out she needed a kidney , of course i was ready to make the sacrifice again			1
' it was child 's play compared with the first operation , which was definitely more risky			0
' for solicitor @entity4 , 42 , it is difficult to explain just how much @entity3 's sacrifices have meant to her			1
' he 's more worried about my suffering than his own , ' she says			0
about 1,000 people in the @entity89 give up a kidney for a friend or loved one every year			1
the @entity92 , which regulates all donations by living people , must decide who is suitable			0
volunteers must prove they are in robust health and understand what the lengthy , physically arduous process will involve			0
there can be a 12 - week recovery period , and a one - in - 3,000 risk of dying while having a kidney removed			1
@entity4 , who was diagnosed with the genetic condition cystic fibrosis aged two , was already on the transplant list when @entity3 proposed in 1996			1
the couple , who met when they were teenagers , were married the following year			0
cystic fibrosis affects the internal organs , especially the lungs and digestive system , by clogging them with sticky mucus , making it hard to breathe and digest food			0
in sickness and in health : @entity3 and @entity4 were childhood sweethearts before marrying in 1997 only half of sufferers live past the age of 40			1
within a year of their marriage , @entity4 's situation became more desperate			0
' i was on oxygen a lot of the time and towards the end i was on it all of the time , ' she says			0
' but neither of us had ever considered that @entity3 could donate part of his lung			1
' @entity4 was receiving her treatment at the specialist lung unit at @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity54 , when a friend saw a magazine article on lung donation			1
' the doctors were very cautious and said they had done some live lung transplants at @entity139			1
but the operations were risky for both the donor and the recipient , ' she says			0
' they explained the survival rate was n't very high and there was a strong risk that i might not pull through afterwards			0
' at first the couple rejected the idea but as @entity4 became increasingly ill , it suddenly became their only option			0
@entity3 , along with four members of @entity4 's family , including her father and brother , volunteered to be tested to see if they could donate			1
unusually , @entity3 turned out to be a good match and @entity4 's cousin also offered a section of his lung			1
' we had to take a gamble on live donation because i might have got to the stage where i was too sick to have a transplant from a donor – live or dead , ' says @entity4			0
' both @entity3 and my cousin agreed – after counselling – that they were prepared to risk their lives to save mine			1
both were desperate to see me living a normal life			0
' @entity182 : sir @entity183 , @entity4 's surgeon during her lung surgery , is one of @entity89 's experts on organ transplants @entity3 adds : ' i had watched her deteriorate and it was enough for me to do something about it			1
the risks were there , but there was no question i would donate			0
' the pioneering surgery , carried out by professor sir @entity183 , one of the world 's leading transplant surgeons , was hugely controversial because so many patients had died during previous procedures			0
in fact the operation has subsequently been suspended in @entity89 because of the risks			0
today , @entity4 is regarded as something of a medical miracle because she is one of only four patients who underwent the procedure in the @entity89 and survived			0
only about 50 per cent of any lung transplant patients are still alive after ten years , so the fact she has survived 13 years with very limited problems makes her tale all the more remarkable			1
@entity4 's lungs function perfectly and she has near - normal breathing			0
however , she has needed to take powerful drugs to suppress her immune system and prevent her body from rejecting the new organ			2
she still also has the digestive problems associated with cystic fibrosis and must take daily enzymes and immuno - suppressive drugs that have had an effect on other organs			0
about five per cent of those who have lung transplants go on to suffer kidney damage because of these drugs			1
unfortunately , @entity4 is one of those affected , and during the past 12 months doctors informed her that tests showed she would soon need dialysis or a kidney transplant			2
she says : ' ordinarily , going on to dialysis would n't have been a problem , but i was at added risk by being someone who had already had a transplant			0
' there was an increased risk of picking up an infection and the effect of the dialysis on my anti-rejection medication			0
the doctors were worried it would put me at risk			0
' for @entity3 , who was left with a scar on his back after donating part of his lung , the answer was simple			1
he says : ' i had invested part of my lung all those years ago and it was ironic that the drugs used to keep @entity4 's lung healthy had damaged her kidneys and i was called upon again			1
' i love her , and i was n't prepared to see what i gave to her all that time ago put at risk			0
' the latest operation was carried out by professor @entity256			0
@entity3 was discharged on december 17 , and @entity4 was allowed home four days later			1
@entity3 expects to be well enough to return to work in the middle of january , while @entity4 will be recovering for several months			1
a spokesman for the @entity92 said : ' this would appear to be a first			0
live donors are a very important part of the transplant programme			0
' mr @entity3 should be congratulated on giving twice			1
' prof @entity265 added : ' it is amazing for someone to give an organ twice			2
in all my years in transplant surgery i have not heard of an example			2
' @entity4 's lung physician , dr @entity272 , said : ' i 'm not aware of any other individual donating tissue twice to a spouse or any other – it is an extraordinary case			1
the lung donation would have been the more risky of the two transplants			2
but i admire anyone who gives an organ twice			2
' @entity3 is prepared to donate again should @entity4 need his help a third time – although his options are understandably limited			1
he says : ' i would n't think twice about doing it again if i had to , although all i have left to give is my liver [ the only remaining organ he , as a living donor , could donate part of ]			2
' ironically , doing this for @entity4 has actually improved my life expectancy because i 'm having such regular check - ups			0
' both times , the medical teams have been just fantastic			0
if our story can encourage other people to become living donors , that would be wonderful			0
