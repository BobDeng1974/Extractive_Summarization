by @entity0 published : 16:12 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 16:12 est , 12 june 2013 dungarees are , according to the fashion pages , back in fashion			1
not only have style icons such as @entity5 and @entity6 been spotted out and about in them , but they ’ve also been all over the catwalks			1
and while it might not be a surprise to see them championed by designers who target the youth market , such as @entity14 and @entity15 , grown - up labels , including @entity17 and @entity18 , have come up with their versions , too			1
their chic designs prompted me to wonder if @entity24 , a grandmother in her early 70s , could carry off such a look			2
the last time i stepped out in dungarees was in the late @entity28			1
made from thick , brushed cotton with a fake fur trim , they were bottle green and even had a matching jacket			2
back in fashion : trendsetters @entity5 , left and @entity35 have been pictured in dungarees recently but could grandmother @entity0 pull them off ? scroll down to find out ... i ’d picked them up at a @entity40 and though i ca n’t recall how much i paid for them , i clearly remember wearing them around @entity43 , my husband @entity45 ’s then constituency			1
some people say you should never wear a trend if you can remember its previous incarnation , but i ’ve always had a soft spot for dungarees , so i was delighted to try the new versions			1
here ’s how they shaped up ... @entity0 wears : floral dungarees , £ 29.99 , quizclothing.co.uk			1
white sleeveless top , £ 85 , reiss.com			2
red patent heels , £ 165 , lucychoilondon.com floral dungarees , £ 29.99 , quizclothing.co.uk when i saw these on the hanger , they had instant appeal			1
they really stood out against some of the other more subdued designs			2
and there ’s no doubt that they would look incredibly cute on someone younger - and not just my toddling grandchildren			2
but sadly , i felt like an old sheep in them			2
dungarees have always had slightly child - like connotations - maybe it ’s because we dress babies in them or that they used to be almost uniform for children ’s tv presenters - either way , these felt as if they lived down to that stereotype			1
i ’ve usually got no problem wearing clothes designed for any age			2
in the past , i ’ve swapped clothes with my daughter , @entity85 , who ’s in her 30s , so that ’s not a problem for me			2
i do n’t think any of my children would be shocked to see me in what might be considered a young trend			0
but these just looked a little bit off			0
teamed with a pair of brightly coloured heels , i felt like mutton dressed as lamb			0
made me feel like a farmhand : denim dungarees , £ 40 , missselfridge.com			1
t - shirt , £ 39 , reiss.com denim dungarees , £ 40 , missselfridge.com @entity35 looked great when she was pictured in denim dungarees , but i ’m afraid these made me look as if i should be up a ladder with a paintbrush in my hand			1
i did once own a pair like these , but they were strictly for gardening			0
i felt self - conscious in these as the cut requires rather more up top than i possess			0
women with big busts might shy away from dungarees , but they ’d be wrong			1
for me , the heavier fabric made them less forgiving , they did n’t drape nicely and they added inches to my hips			0
they made me feel like a farmhand and got me to wondering if the name dungarees had come about because this was the sort of thing you ’d wear to shift dung			1
sadly , it ’s a little more prosaic - garments like this were made from a coarse fabric from a region of @entity127 known as @entity128			0
elegant : check dungarees , £ 55 , topshop.com			1
cream blouse , £ 28 , next.co.uk			0
nude sandals , £ 39.99 , zara.com check dungarees , £ 55 , topshop.com while this checked design was elegant , i thought they were perhaps too much for day and not enough for evening			1
maybe with some brighter accessories they might have made more of an impact , but these seemed to struggle to find their identity			0
though they would n’t be my first choice for gallivanting around town , this experiment has inspired me to give dungarees another go			1
i think many women my age would shy away from them , perhaps thinking they would n’t be flattering or that they could look foolish			0
but if you like trouser suits , you can wear dungarees			1
just pick the right pair , team them with a nice pair of heels and they wo n’t look remotely as if you ’re a child or a decorator			0
honestly ! chic : @entity160 sequin top , £ 85 , @entity161 at @entity162 , 020 7629 916			0
@entity163 , £ 39.99 , zara.com black dungarees , £ 45 , @entity165 what a revelation ! they looked like nothing on the hanger , but once on , i was impressed by how elegant they were			1
these are so chic i could wear them to a glamorous evening function			0
the silk fabric seemed to hang in a flattering way , and though i worried they might bulge in all the wrong places , in fact they ’re kind to a pear shape			0
short sleeves made my arms feel exposed , so i ’d probably wear a longer sleeved top , maybe in white for contrast			0
these dungarees could take the place of a trouser suit			1
i always think a little cross-dressing - such as a tuxedo - is rather fun and can look striking			0
forgiving : polka dot dungarees , £ 40 , riverisland.com			1
white blazer , £ 345 , theory at @entity162 , 020 7629 9161 @entity194 top , £ 29.99 , zara.com			0
black slingbacks , £ 39.99 , zara.com polka dot dungarees , £ 40 , riverisland.com i did n't buy into onesies - they were reminiscent of those awful bodies we wore in the @entity201 that you had to do up under your crotch			2
dungarees are more wear - able , but you have to pay a bit of attention when you go to the loo that the straps do n’t disappear into the pan			2
these spotty ones were easy to slip on and off , as you have to undo only one strap			0
i can see these working as a lunch outfit or even as office wear			0
dungarees are far more forgiving than trousers			2
my best feature is my waist and they defined that without hugging my bottom			0
you do n’t quite know what ’s going on inside , so they do a good job of hiding things			0
i do n’t think that my husband @entity225 would object to them , though he might just think i was wearing trousers and a top			0
@entity0 ’s latest book ex-wives published by @entity230 , is available in paperback and on @entity232 styling : @entity233 : @entity234 pictures : l + @entity235 and make - up : @entity238 / fashion			1
