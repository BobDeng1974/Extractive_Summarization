@entity0 wants to solve @entity2 goalscoring problems by signing @entity3 from @entity6 side @entity4			1
the former @entity8 striker , who has been at @entity9 recovering from a groin injury over the past few weeks , wants to return to the @entity11			0
his former manager @entity12 also wants him at @entity13 and @entity15 chief @entity14 has also confirmed that he has an interest in the @entity4 forward			1
@entity2 have offered the striker , who began his career with @entity27 , a lifeline and may be the only team willing to fund the deal			0
@entity4 spent £ 6m on @entity3 and increased his £ 70,000 a week wages when they signed him from @entity32			1
they want to recoup a substantial part of that to release him and few @entity11 teams are willing to match the huge salary for a player of his age			0
@entity3 is a noted goalscorer and @entity2 are desperate to find a solution to their issues up front after slipping to the foot of the table			2
@entity0 ’s side have won only three games all season since they were promoted to the @entity11 and are fighting for survival under their manager			0
@entity0 is hoping that @entity3 's prolific record could help @entity54 climb out the relegation zone both @entity15 manager @entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 's @entity12 have shown an interest in signing the striker he wants @entity3 to join @entity2 , who beat @entity15 and drew with @entity60 over the festive period , to increase their chances of survival			1
@entity12 is also in the market for a striker and has made it clear on a number of occasions that he wants to work with @entity3 again			2
but the figures to bring him back to @entity71 appear to be prohibitive and @entity12 may have to look elsewhere if they can not match @entity2 ’s bid			2
@entity3 , who is closing in on fitness , wants his future resolved before the end of january and is determined to return to the @entity11 .			0
