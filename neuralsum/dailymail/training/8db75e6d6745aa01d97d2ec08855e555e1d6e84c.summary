by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 12:20 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 29 april 2013 rep. @entity2 , a @entity3 from @entity4 , said she wants to raise the income tax rates paid by @entity7 's top earners to between 45 and 49 per cent , largely to justify more government spending			2
' we need increased revenue , ' she said in a statement , ' to eliminate the sequester , fund investments in education , public safety , and infrastructure and provide support for @entity7 striving to reach the middle class			1
' @entity2 @entity19 congresswoman @entity2 wants top earners to pay more - a lot more - to the government at tax time , and justifies it with calls for revenue that would enable more spending billionaire @entity27 has said he would welcome a requirement to pay more in income tax			1
@entity30 has called for a 30 per cent ' @entity32 ' tax plan			1
@entity2 's would put rates far higher @entity2 said her fairness in @entity35 , introduced in the @entity36 on thursday , would put more money in the hands of the poor and the middle class			1
' our country faces an inequality crisis , ' she insisted			0
@entity7 's top marginal tax rate sits at 39.6 per cent , a rate that 's paid on income earned over $ 400,000 for single filers and above $ 450,000 for married earners who file tax returns jointly with their spouses			1
@entity2 would add five new tax brackets , starting with a 45 per cent rate for income between $ 1 million and $ 10 million , and ending with 49 per cent for earnings after a taxpayer 's first $ 1 billion in any tax year			1
that stratospheric top rate would only affect a handful of @entity7 , mostly those in the financial sector and many successful business entrepreneurs			0
conservative push - back : sen. @entity64 ( @entity65 ) is n't impressed with @entity2 's plan to hike tax rates for business leaders and entrepreneurs who earn more than $ 1 million , but the @entity71 would reap a windfall while a @entity75 @entity36 majority makes it extremely unlikely that @entity2 's bill would receive serious consideration - much less a vote - senate republicans also slammed the idea			1
' instead of raising rates on anyone we should lower rates for everyone by getting rid of special interest subsidies in the tax code , said @entity86 , communications director for senator @entity64 , an @entity87 @entity75			1
@entity86 also pointed out @entity2 's legislation does n't balance a tax increase on the rich with tax cuts for lower - income earners			1
those @entity7 , he said , are already frozen out of the behind - the - scenes lobbying efforts mounted by large corporations , effectively freezing them out of any chance to see their taxes lowered			0
' tax earmarks for @entity102 movie producers , politically - connected " green " energy companies , and professional sports leagues are effective tax rate increases for lower income @entity7 who ca n't afford to hire lobbyists , ' @entity86 told @entity108			2
' true tax reform will create shared prosperity rather than shared misery			0
' @entity112 , the anti-tax crusader whose @entity116 pressures lawmakers from both major parties to pledge that they wo n't vote for tax increases while in office , was angered by the idea of a new tax increase from the left side of the aisle			2
@entity112 , a conservative tax activist and president of @entity116 ( r ) , has raised eyebrows with his endorsement of immigration reform laws but has remained steadfast on his signature issue : preventing tax increases ' congresswoman @entity2 's collection of tax hikes - just four months after @entity30 's income and social security tax hikes - reminds us that @entity19 ' answer to all questions is " raise taxes , " ' @entity112 told @entity108			2
' and after that , " raise taxes , again			0
' a senior @entity75 aide told @entity108 that the @entity19 ' ' incessant drumbeat to hike taxes ' would ultimately ' kill off millions of jobs in this country , and that 's really their biggest sin			2
' ' for all the @entity19 ' talk about compassion , ' he added , ' i just do n't see it			0
' the aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about pending legislation			0
@entity158 , the press secretary for @entity160 @entity159 , also vented about @entity2 's tax - increase plan			1
' it 's easy to say people should pay more in taxes when you are n’t the one that is paying them , ' @entity158 told @entity108			0
' the fiscal cliff plan provided hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases earlier this year			2
senator @entity159 would like to see a focus on encouraging growth through simplifying the tax code , broadening the base , and lowering the rates instead of always trying to raise people ’s taxes			0
' ' the government has to stop its borrowing and spending , ' he added			0
' president @entity30 has similarly called for higher tax rates on upper - income earners , insisting that they ' pay their fair share			1
' he has also called for continued year - on - year increases in federal government spending in january president @entity30 's administration allowed a payroll tax holiday to expire , restoring older rates for @entity191 and @entity192 withholding and costing taxpayers an additional 2 per cent of their income up to $ 110,100			1
a @entity196 spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about whether the president supports @entity2 's plan to expand the tax base even more			2
@entity75 in the @entity36 continue to project a united front on their leaders ' goal of reforming the @entity7 tax code			1
' the ( @entity75 ) conference will unite around tax reform , ' @entity207 @entity206 told the @entity210 on saturday			1
' the window is now			0
' @entity212 , a @entity75 who chairs the powerful @entity214 , added that conservatives want to scrap the entire tax code and start from scratch , with the goal of keeping just two income tax rates in place - with a 25 per cent ceiling			1
' we 're not going to take the current code and see what comes out , ' @entity212 told the @entity210			0
' we 're going to take a blank piece of paper and see what goes back in			0
' co-sponsors of @entity2 's bill include @entity230			0
@entity231 of @entity232 , @entity233 of @entity234 , @entity235 of @entity4 , @entity236 of @entity237 , @entity238 of @entity239 and @entity240 of @entity241			0
all are democrats with liberal voting records .			0
