if @entity1 needed to make a decision on the future of @entity4 now , there 's every chance they 'd allow his season - long loan deal to run its course before sending him back to @entity10			1
fortunately for the @entity12 , he has until april to turn around his disappointing form - and the unwanted statistics that accompany it - to secure a permanent deal at @entity17			2
the numbers do n't lie			0
@entity4 has been less productive in front of goal during his four months with the @entity21 than at any of the @entity23 clubs he has played for previously			1
@entity4 ( left ) tussles with @entity27 's @entity26 during @entity1 's third - round @entity28 win the @entity12 striker skips over a sliding challenge from @entity27 's @entity31 at @entity32 @entity4 failed to find the back of the net as @entity1 ran out 2 - 0 winners over their @entity37 opponents his opportunities under @entity39 have been limited due to injury - 12 appearances in the @entity41 and one in the @entity28 so far - but he has done little to warrant @entity1 splashing out £ 43million to sign him at the end of the season			1
as part of a £ 150m spending spree last summer , the @entity17 club paid @entity10 a £ 6m fee to take the 28 - year - old on a temporary basis , while also agreeing to pay him wages of £ 285,000 - a - week			0
so far he has failed to justify that outlay , having scored just three goals for his new club			0
even with creative geniuses @entity57 and @entity58 behind him , it just has n't quite happened for @entity4			0
there is an argument that he is still finding his feet - and a regular place in @entity63 's starting xi - after a calf injury kept him out for a month between between late october and november			0
@entity4 pokes home @entity1 's equalising goal against @entity67 on @entity68 the striker , who is on loan from @entity10 , celebrates after scoring for @entity1 at the @entity71 but his stats for the @entity21 tell a different story			1
@entity4 appears to be a player in terminal decline after bursting into public consciousness with prolific spells at @entity78 and @entity79			0
in his final season with the @entity82 side , the @entity12 scored an average of 0.7 goals per game and had 1.7 shots on target every match			1
at @entity1 he has managed just 0.3 goals and 0.9 shots on target every 90 minutes			1
comparing @entity4 's numbers while at @entity78 - a team who were dominating their division - with those he has produced in a @entity1 side who are still in transition under @entity63 may be slightly unfair , but the trend continues throughout his time in @entity101 and @entity102			2
@entity4 scored 0.71 goals per game in the 2011 - 12 season at @entity79 and 0.82 the following campaign			1
he also recorded 1.76 shots on target in his first season and 1.56 in his second - all of which are superior to his numbers in the red of @entity1			0
@entity4 , pictured celebrating a goal against @entity114 in the @entity116 semi-finals , was prolific for @entity78 the striker earned a £ 50million move to @entity102 side @entity10 after impressing for @entity79 in @entity101 @entity4 celebrates scoring against @entity120 shortly before joining @entity1 on a season - long loan a £ 50million move to big - spenders @entity10 followed and he continued his good form in @entity102 before suffering anterior cruciate ligament damage while on international duty last january			1
@entity4 netted 0.53 goals per game for the @entity130 side and hit the target 1.41 times every 90 minutes - his worse stats for three seasons but still better than what he has achieved in @entity135			2
to his credit he does have three assists for @entity1 , the same amount he managed in his first season in @entity101 and more than in any other campaign in @entity23			0
. but strikers will always be judged on goals and , quite simply , @entity4 is n't scoring enough of them or having enough attempts to convince us that he will find the sort of form which once made him one of the hottest properties in world football			2
if he continues in the same vein , do n't expect to see him at @entity17 next season .			0

@entity4 has scored three goals during his loan at @entity1
the @entity21 will need to spend £ 43million to sign him permanently
but the @entity12 has failed to find the form he showed at former clubs
@entity4 has managed just 0.3 goals per game in @entity162 so far
@entity39 and @entity1 will make a decision on signing him in april
