by @entity0 remember the term ' @entity2 ' ? we reported on it a couple of months ago - the bland fashion uniform consisting of plain tees , comfortable shoes , understated anoraks and dad jeans ? just got your fuzzy fashion head around that ? well sorry to break it to you , but it 's already old news in the fast - paced and fickle world of fashion , where buzzwords come and go quicker than you can say @entity20			1
the latest trend to be embracing ? that would be # @entity23 , which comes complete with a hashtag because it originated on @entity25 , where fashion 's elite set the seasonal trends			1
new trend : the latest style craze to sweep social media is the # @entity33 trend , which @entity20 models to perfection ( think joggers , comfy t - shirts and trainers ) # @entity23 involves combining streetwear with comfy pyjama style clothes - think cashmere jumpers , sweatpants and trainers or pool sliders			1
it takes the sportswear trend a step further and the trendsetters are pairing grey jogging bottoms with slouchy t - shirts and jumpers and slipping on @entity52 trainers ( the only footwear to be seen in this season )			1
refinery 29 's @entity55 , who spotted the trend , said : ' they live life on the corner where fashion and comfort meet			1
and , with the rise of high - concept sweatpants , slides , pullovers , and more in the women ’s space , it seems the # cozygirl movement is on the rise			2
' speaking about the trend , @entity71 's resident fashion blogger , @entity70 , said : ' i absolutely love this look , it 's cool , effortless and can actually be quite chic			1
look to @entity76 with her various looser fit trousers , relaxed t - shirts and waterfall , sleeveless jackets			0
she wore a couple of looks like this which were uber comfy and cool			0
get the look : the trend aims to merge fashion and comfort and consists of sweatpants , slides , trainers and pullovers ; @entity92 is stocked with everything you need to pull it off smartening up : @entity96 rocked elasticated waistband joggers in her @entity99 campaign but added heels and a blazer to take her look from day to night ' however you have to make sure you do n't become a fashion victim			1
we do n't actually want to see your pyjamas , and make sure if you are going out head - to - toe in slouchy pieces you give yourself some shape - maybe tuck in your tee or shirt ? simple but makes a difference			0
' there are lots of cosy chic looks from the catwalks of late			0
@entity118 for @entity119 styled up a gorgeous maxi skirt with a plain white t - shirt			0
@entity122 rocked this exact look at @entity124 earlier this year			0
' elasticated waists are now ok			0
they are no longer just reserved for old age homes			0
try a pair of heels with joggers for a fierce - girl look , for instance			2
it 's all about having a bit of fun with your wardrobe , and trying to look like you have n't tried at all ! ' fresh off the runway : @entity139 at @entity141 's @entity140 , left , sent models down the catwalk in a # @entity23 coat , while @entity145 are going cosy crazy this season style blogger @entity147 , founder of @entity148 , is yet to be convinced			1
she said : ' recently i bought a pair of sports luxe " cosy girl " joggers from @entity99 , as seen on @entity96 in the billboard campaign			1
@entity96 looked hot to trot in her loose pants and heels			2
i appeared to gain two stone the second i put them on			0
and this is my problem with " cosy " fashion wear - you need to be stunning and super slim to make it look cool			2
' i 'm a big fan of dressing according to your shape and most of these clothes assume we have no shape , which is pretty unrealistic at best and complete fashion snobbery at worst			2
' i like - and wear - some of the simple pieces worn with something a bit more glamorous that will work harder for me and my hips , but as a rule i vote that # @entity23 should stay under the duvet where she belongs			1
' mango relaxed plush sweatshirt , £ 19.99 , @entity180 , @entity181 , £ 17.99 , @entity92 white leather pool slider , £ 15 , @entity183 , @entity184 , £ 33 , @entity92			0

# @entity23 trend consists of joggers , jumpers and trainers
