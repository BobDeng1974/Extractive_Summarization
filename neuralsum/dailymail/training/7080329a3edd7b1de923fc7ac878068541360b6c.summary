by @entity1 medical correspondent where you live could provide clues to your health and the influence the environment may have on it , say researchers			0
they have come up with a new online atlas mapping the geographical pattern of various diseases across @entity12 and @entity13 – and companion maps of environmental factors such as air pollution , sunshine and pesticides			1
this is the first time in the @entity20 that researchers have produced such detailed maps			0
they can access the health and environment maps for a locality , which provide an indication of the health risk for the area relative to the average for @entity12 and @entity13			2
however , researchers caution that simply comparing the health and environment maps will not enable people to conclude there is a causal link between a specific environmental factor and a health condition as there are likely to be a number of factors at play			2
for example , the atlas shows that skin cancer risk is greatest in southwest @entity12 even though sunshine duration is highest in southeast @entity12			1
the geographical pattern of 14 diseases and conditions such as lung cancer , breast cancer , heart disease , leukaemia and low birth weight are highlighted using data from the @entity71 precautions : the atlas shows that skin cancer risk is greatest in southwest @entity12 even though sunshine duration is highest in southeast @entity12 this suggests that despite a lower level of sunlight in the southwest people may be more exposed , which could trigger research into behavioural differences between the areas to explain the variation			1
the healthiest places appear to be in central @entity27 , @entity86 , parts of @entity88 , and @entity30			1
riskier areas tend to be in the @entity90 , parts of @entity92 and @entity93			1
the geographical pattern of 14 diseases and conditions such as lung cancer , breast cancer , heart disease , leukaemia and low birth weight are highlighted using data from the @entity71 and cancer registries for 1985 to 2009			2
it is the first to adjust for both age and deprivation which means the geographical patterns of health risk ca n’t be explained as the result of ageing populations or poverty			0
it was produced by the @entity20 @entity111 ( @entity112 ) , part of the @entity114 based at @entity115			0
pattern : riskier areas tend to be in the @entity90 , such as @entity117 ( pictured ) parts of @entity92 and @entity93 its website says : ‘ the aim of the @entity122 is to provide information to assist in the development of hypotheses about the role of environmental factors in chronic disease and to inform public health research and action			1
’ lead author dr @entity131 from @entity112 in @entity115 ’s @entity132 , said the atlas was a ‘ fantastic tool ’			0
but professor @entity135 , professor of @entity136 at the @entity137 , said multiple risk factors would have a greater effect on the chances of developing a major disease than environmental exposures			2
he said : ‘ in other words , people should adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle as far as possible			0
‘ this atlas does not enable anyone to judge their individual absolute risk			0
people should definitely not use this atlas to decide where to live			0
’ alongside health risk maps , the atlas – at www.envhealthatlas.co.uk – provides a series of maps of four environmental agents : air pollution , agricultural pesticides , disinfection by - products in drinking water and sunshine duration using data from 2000 or 2001 .			1

online atlas maps the geographical pattern of various diseases
@entity27 , north @entity86 and @entity30 listed as healthiest areas
riskier places *include* the @entity90 , parts of @entity92 and @entity93
@entity122 shows skin cancer risk is greatest in south east @entity12
maps of environmental factors such as air pollution also published
