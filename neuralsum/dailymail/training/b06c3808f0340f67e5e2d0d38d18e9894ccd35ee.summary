the woman in the supermarket peered past my basket and into the pushchair where my one - year - old daughter , @entity5 , sat contentedly munching on a rice cake			1
‘ oh she ’s gorgeous , ’ she said			1
‘ look at those chubby thighs - i could just eat them			2
’ as she waltzed off down the aisle , i could feel my cheeks stinging red as if she ’d slapped me			2
my son @entity26 is nearly four			2
however , unlike his butterball sister , he ’s a whippet of a boy whom i constantly worry does n’t weigh enough			1
when @entity26 was a baby i struggled to feed him and he spent his first few months scrawny and scrabbling around at the bottom of the weight charts			1
it caused me so much heartache and distress to have a baby that was noted as ‘ failing to thrive ’ on his medical notes that i was positively insane with angst			0
when a woman in the same shop had commented how little @entity26 was ( he was weeks old ) i promptly burst into tears			0
@entity20 says : ' when i look at my dear little @entity5 , i can see that while she may be tubby , at least she 's not obese			1
and , at just 12 months , she is not properly up and about yet ' so you ’d think i would have been thrilled when my daughter came along , weighing a bouncing 7lb 4oz			1
unlike her brother , she was a really good feeder , and soon had those rosy , chubby baby cheeks — the sort i ’d longed for when @entity26 ’s hollow face had smiled back at me as a baby			1
‘ she ’s got a good covering , ’ my mum reassured me , as @entity5 grew bigger and stronger with every week			1
i sat back , content that she was going to be ok , and this time motherhood would be a breeze			0
but , as her little limbs became podgier and chunkier , a dark , fearful thought started to stir inside me : what if my daughter was going to be fat ? i did n’t dare confide in anyone			1
especially when one of @entity26 ’s nursery workers admired her extra tyres of blubber and exclaimed how she missed the days when her own toddler daughter was as fat as a little @entity64			1
she ’d have been horrified if she ’d known what was going on in my head			0
and when i look at my dear little @entity5 , i can see that while she may be tubby , at least she ’s not obese			1
and , at just 12 months , she is not properly up and about yet			1
i know — well , i ’m hoping — that as soon as she starts racing around with her brother , the fat will melt away , leaving her a normal - sized little toddler			0
it does n’t take a genius or even a psychiatrist to figure out what is really going on			0
it ’s clear that my fears and obsessions are in fact only about one person — me			1
while i ’m not overweight now , i did struggle as a young girl			1
i always had solid thighs and felt bigger than everyone else in junior school			0
then , as a teenager i did n’t feel comfortable in my ever - growing body			0
i hid my flabby bits away under baggy tracksuit bottoms and jumpers , and desperately avoided any parties where a dress would be required			0
i joined @entity89 at 14 in an attempt to lose the extra 21lb i was carrying			0
i was convinced losing weight would be the answer to all my unhappiness and insecurities			0
and lose weight i did			0
the number of ‘ oversized ’ babies , meaning they weigh over 8lb 13oz , has risen by 25 per cent in the past 30 years with hindsight i can also see that , even at a size 14 , i really did n’t look that bad			0
however , the words : ‘ she should n’t be wearing that dress with her legs , ’ still ring in my ears today , despite the fact they were spoken 20 years ago by one of the ‘ cool ’ girls on a school camp			0
i doubt the girl who whispered them even remembers my name , but i hear her voice every time i glance in the mirror , deciding whether to buy an outfit or not			0
these are the reasons i worry for my daughter			1
nearly every woman i know struggles in some way with her body image			0
either we ’re not thin enough , not curvy enough or our boobs are n’t big or small enough			0
now we ’ve had babies , our skin is stretch - marked and saggy			0
when i found out i was expecting a girl i cried for 12 hours			1
i was petrified of what it would mean for her and tormented myself about whether i would be up to the job			0

@entity20 says it ’s clear that her fears and obsessions are in fact only about one person — herself			1
my son , i was confident , would take after his dad — secure in his own skin and of his place in the world			0
a daughter , i feared , would look to me as an example and history would repeat itself			2
i worried that she would spend days on end staring at her reflection , hating it , despising it , believing it would never be good enough			0
it was clear from the start she was n’t a skinny bean like her brother , but i reassured myself that it was better and healthier that way			2
@entity20 worries that her daughter will spend days on end staring at her reflection , hating it , despising it , believing it will never be good enough when the time came , i weaned her on home - cooked organic food			1
barely a jar of prepared baby food passed her lips			0
it filled me with joy when @entity5 gobbled up another homemade fish pie or cauliflower cheese and scraped the bottom of the organic , sugar - free yogurt pot i gave her			1
she was a pleasure to feed			0
but when her full face caught the camera at an unflattering angle , causing it to balloon out of proportion , or when my mother teased that she had roly - poly thighs that might not fit the cute little trousers i had just bought her , the cold horrible jolt hit me like lightning — my baby was fat			0
i blamed myself , naturally			0
had i set her on a collision course to obesity by giving her formula milk when she was seven months old ? what if she was fat because i let her have a bite of cake or a lick of my ice cream , rejoicing at the look of delight on her face when the sweet coldness touched her lips			2
@entity20 worries that @entity5 delights too much in being allowed edible treats or maybe it was my fault because , deep down , she was hard - wired to be just like me : weak - willed when food is around and utterly incapable of stopping at just one slice of cake or square of chocolate			1
so when that kind stranger bent over @entity5 ’s pushchair and complimented me , all i heard was : ‘ fat baby , just like her mother ! ’ i ’ve confided my fears to my husband @entity134 who , rightly , shakes his head in despair			1
he does n’t look at our daughter and worry about her weight			2
he cares whether she is happy and healthy , which of course i do , too			2
although he is certain of one thing : whatever she grows up to be , she must not inherit my insecurities			0
we ’ve discussed in depth how i must not share my fears about her weight , or the despair i feel at mine			2
i never mention diets in front of my children — i even spell out the word ‘ fat ’ as if it is a swear word they must never hear			2
i know it ’s up to me to make a change as well			2
i ’m determined to teach my children how to live healthily , eat well and exercise regularly			1
they see me exercising and eating fresh fruit and vegetables , so i can be good role model			2
i have to toughen up and sort my head out , because i am grateful for two healthy children and , as long as they are happy , the size of their clothes means nothing at all			1
i ’ll make certain to rain kisses on my daughter ’s bonny cheeks , and enjoy them , because i know one day when she grows up they ’ll be gone and i ’ll miss those moments more than anything .			1
