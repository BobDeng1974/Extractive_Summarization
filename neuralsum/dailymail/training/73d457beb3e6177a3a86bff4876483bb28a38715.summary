schoolbook authors have been told not to write about sausages or pigs for fear of causing offence			1
guidance from leading educational publisher the @entity5 prohibits authors from including anything that could be perceived as pork - related in their books			1
the bizarre clampdown , apparently aimed at avoiding offence among @entity14 , emerged yesterday during a discussion about free speech on @entity18 ’s today programme			1
it was immediately branded ‘ nonsensical political correctness ’			2
‘ among the things prohibited in the text that was commissioned by @entity5 was the following : pigs plus sausages , or anything else which could be perceived as pork			1
‘ now , if a respectable publisher , tied to an academic institution , is saying you 've got to write a book in which you can not mention pigs because some people might be offended , it ’s just ludicrous			2
it is just a joke			0
' @entity53 mp @entity52 said : ‘ i absolutely agree			1
that ’s absolute utter nonsense			1
and when people go too far , that brings the whole discussion into disrepute			0
’ the @entity5 says its guidelines exist because it needs to make its educational material available to as many people as possible			0
@entity53 mp @entity52 called the ban on pork - related content ' absolute utter nonsense ' a spokesman said : ‘ many of the educational materials we publish in the @entity69 are sold in more than 150 countries , and as such they need to consider a range of cultural differences and sensitivities			1
' our editorial guidelines are intended to help ensure that the resources that we produce can be disseminated to the widest possible audience			0
’ but last night the publishing rules were ridiculed amid doubts either @entity79 or @entity80 would be offended by mention of farm animals in a children ’s book			1
@entity86 mp @entity85 said : ‘ how on earth can anyone find the word “ pig ” or “ pork ” offensive ? ' no word is offensive			2
it is the context in which it is used that is offensive			0
’ he added : ‘ on the one hand you have politicians and the great and the good falling over each other to say how much they believe in freedom of speech and on the other hand they are presiding over people being unable to use and write words that are completely inoffensive			0
' we have got to get a grip on this nonsensical political correctness			0
‘ the political correctness brigade appear to have taken control of our schools			0
' the secretary of state needs to get a grip over this and make sure this ridiculous ban is stopped at once			2
’ he added that perhaps one good thing to come out of the @entity120 terror attacks was a groundswell of support for freedom of speech			0
the chief executive of campaigning group @entity125 , @entity126 , said : ‘ it is difficult to imagine any context in which images of everyday objects – like pigs – or the word itself should be banned from being used in a children ’s book			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity137 added : ‘ @entity137 law prohibits eating pork , not the mention of the word , or the animal from which it derives			2
authors following the @entity145 guidelines would not be able to mention characters from @entity147 ( pictured )			1

@entity149 is apparently aimed at avoiding offence among @entity80 and @entity79
publisher prohibits mentioning anything that ' could be perceived as pork '
@entity145 wants authors to consider ' cultural differences and sensitivities '
@entity53 mp @entity52 calls ban ' absolute utter nonsense '
