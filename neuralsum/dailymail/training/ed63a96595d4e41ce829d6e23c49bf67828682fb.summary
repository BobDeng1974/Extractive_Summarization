by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:34 est , 5 july 2012 updated : 19:29 est , 5 july 2012 economic output has barely grown for a year and a half , credit conditions are tight and the eurozone crisis remains a major problem , the @entity2 said yesterday			0
in a bleak analysis , the @entity2 ’s governor , sir @entity8 , said @entity10 is not even ‘ halfway through ’ its economic crisis – suggesting it will not end until at least 2017			1
the warning came as the @entity2 hit the panic button , kicking off another round of money printing in an attempt to revive the economy			1
it increased its controversial quantitative easing ( @entity20 ) programme by £ 50billion , raising the total to £ 375billion as it warned that the economy ’s problems are likely to be ‘ greater and more persistent ’			1
the @entity2 's @entity26 has voted to increase the quantitative easing programme - effectively printing more cash - from £ 325bn to £ 375bn the amount printed is £ 14,000 for every family in @entity10 , or more than half the government ’s spending , but experts say further quantitative easing is possible			1
@entity35 , chief economist at the @entity36 , said : ‘ it wo n’t be the end of the story			0
we could see another £ 50billion within a few months			1
’ yesterday the @entity41 raised its concerns about whether the policy is actually working			0
chairman @entity44 said : ‘ the point is to get more money to businesses so they can invest and grow			2
but it is clear this money is not getting through			2
’ the @entity2 said it will keep the base interest rate frozen at 0.5 per cent			1
it has been at this historic low since march 2009			2
the @entity20 boost comes amid signs the economy deteriorated in june as industry surveys showed that the construction sector went into reverse and the powerhouse services sector suffered its worst performance for eight months			2
most economists think gross domestic product - a broad measure for the total economy - fell slightly in the second quarter of 2012 , following declines of 0.4 per cent and 0.3 per cent in the previous two quarters , as the eurozone debt crisis gathers pace			2
the move has drawn criticism from pensioners ’ groups , who have blamed the adverse effect of money - printing for a ' meltdown ' in annuity rates in recent years			1
saga director - general @entity77 criticised the policy for keeping inflation higher than it would have otherwise been , making it even harder for people to find any accounts to give them a real return on their savings			1
on top of this , @entity20 has made more than a million pensioners worse off , which has damaged growth rather than encouraged it as people have less money to spend , she said			1
q : what is quantitative easing ? a : simply put , quantitative easing , or @entity20 , is an emergency measure used by policymakers to boost economic growth			1
this is something the @entity2 would usually try to achieve by slashing interest rates to encourage people to spend rather than save			1
but when rates can not go any lower - as is nearly the case in @entity10 , where they are at a record low of 0.5 per cent - the @entity2 will pump cash directly into the economy to encourage lending and activity			1
q : has n’t the bank done this before ? a : yes , the @entity2 started to inject more money into the economy in march 2009 followed by further bouts in october 2011 and february			1
before this latest decision , the level of @entity20 issued by the @entity2 stood at £ 325billion			2
q : so why has the @entity2 increased @entity20 again ? a : banks are worried about the strength of their finances and since the onset of the credit crunch have tightened up lending dramatically.the escalating eurozone debt crisis has also raised fears over banks ’ exposure to sovereign debt and the impact on @entity10 exports			0
in addition , the @entity10 ’s economy is struggling to pull out of a double dip recession			0
as rates have been held at 0.5 % for more than three years , the @entity2 is left with few options			1
q : is n’t qe just printing money ? a : in effect it is , although the @entity2 does not literally turn on the printing presses to send a huge flurry of new notes into the economy			1
what will happen is that the @entity2 will create the money to buy the assets and credit the reserves of various banks and financial institutions with the new money			2
economists call this ' high - powered ' money because the increase in their reserves should - in theory - allow the banks to go out and lend much more under the ' money multiplier ' principle			1
q : what else can @entity20 do ? a : all things being equal , as well as creating more money , the @entity2 ’s actions should create more liquidity in commercial paper , helping to get capital markets moving more easily again			2
on a technical level , if the @entity2 buys up @entity169 bonds from banks , the cost of the bonds will go up and their yield - or return - will go down			2
this fall in the yield will help lower long - term interest rates			1
q : so now banks should go out and lend more money ? a : this is the $ 64,000 question			0
in principle , @entity20 should boost the money supply , but fears of debt contagion from @entity185 and major changes to regulation in the @entity10 still mean banks are being cautious with their balance sheets			0
she questioned whether the ' experiment ' is actually having the desired effect , in the light of a double dip recession , falling bank lending , rising borrowing costs and a tough employment market			2
dr @entity77 said : ' following fresh banking scandals this week , it is especially difficult to understand why we are doing more easing , which benefits the banks more than any other area of the economy			0
' @entity20 may well have shored up bank balance sheets , as well as helping some borrowers , but this does not boost the economy when banks are failing to lend on reasonable terms			0
' @entity20 relies on banks to recycle new money to the rest of the economy but the banks are not doing their bit			0
' lending to small and medium - sized firms who have been crying out for credit has not come through on reasonable terms , while banks have boosted their margins and balance sheets instead			0
' but business leaders said further stimulus would support confidence and welcomed the decision			0
dr @entity223 , @entity224 deputy director - general , said : ' this extension of @entity20 should provide a fillip to confidence			0
' the @entity2 ’s action also hit the value of the pound against the @entity232 dollar and @entity234 yen as the market will be effectively be flooded with extra sterling			0
the @entity2 said the decision to pump more money into the economy came as @entity10 output had barely grown for a year and a half amid signs its main export markets are slowing			0
it said : ' business indicators point to a continuation of that weakness in the near term , both at home and abroad			0
' the bank added : ' concerns remain about the indebtedness and competitiveness of several euro - area economies , and that is weighing on confidence here			2
' however , it said inflation , which fell to 2.8 per cent in may , should continue to ease in the medium - term and its stimulus measures should help sustain a gradual strengthening in output			0
@entity262 , economist at @entity263 , said : ' we continue to have doubts over how successful extra @entity20 will be , but seeing as the @entity2 has few other options we expect them to stick with it			0
' the increase in @entity20 will come as a blow for pensioners whose annuity rates are hit by the money printing , while the continued low interest rates will hurt savers			1
recent research from accountancy network @entity276 and @entity278 found that record low interest rates combined with the @entity2 ’s emergency support measures are causing savers to lose nearly £ 18billion a year			1
bank governor sir @entity8 recently said he was shocked at the pace at which economic conditions had worsened as he unveiled the biannual @entity285 report			1
the gloomy industry figures for june revealed a further loss of momentum , leading most economists to predict a slight decline in @entity291 in the second quarter			0
the @entity2 's @entity26 had already come close to pushing the button on more qe			0
minutes of the june rates meeting showed four of the nine - strong committee - including sir @entity8 - were narrowly out - voted			1
@entity297 , chief economist at @entity298 , said there might still be more money printing to come , even though he thinks the economy will return to growth in the third quarter of this year			1
he said : ' we certainly would not rule out further @entity20 in the fourth quarter			0
' the economy is likely to remain fragile and prone to relapses , especially if there is not any sustained marked easing in the eurozone ’s problems			0
' so it is very possible that the @entity2 will decide that more support is warranted for the economy , particularly if inflation heads down further			0
' some economists think the @entity2 ’s @entity20 programme could eventually be expanded to £ 500billion .			2
