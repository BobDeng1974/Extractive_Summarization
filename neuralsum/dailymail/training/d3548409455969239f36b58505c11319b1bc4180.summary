by @entity0 published : 23:31 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 23:32 est , 17 september 2013 during the early @entity2 , the legendary jazz musician @entity1 was introduced to the son of a wealthy @entity5 lawyer called @entity6 , who co-owned @entity8 ’s club in @entity9			2
‘ what do you want to be when you grow up ? ’ he asked @entity6 ’s child			2
the boy , who was not yet a teenager , did not have to pause long to dream up his answer			2
‘ a bank robber , ’ he replied			2
that child ’s name was @entity19			1
fast - forward 30 years and — while he has n’t quite realised that lofty ambition — the once - shy youth has perhaps managed to achieve what he regards as the next best thing			0
driving force : @entity27 's creators @entity19 ( left ) and @entity28 have each built personal fortunes estimated at £ 50million from the ultra-violent series @entity19 , with his younger brother and business partner @entity32 , are responsible for turning a generation of sore - thumbed couch potatoes into bank robbers — at least on screen — thanks to the phenomenally successful video game franchise , @entity27 the duo , who live in @entity40 , have each built personal fortunes estimated at £ 50 million from the ultra-violent series , in which players assume the identity of ruthless underworld criminals			1
despite ( or perhaps because of ) its controversial depiction of sex , violence , rape , car - jacking , drug dealing , torture and murder , @entity27 — as it is known to aficionados — has shifted more than 135 million units since its 1997 debut			1
that has translated into billions in profits for their company , @entity60 , which was founded in the late 1990s and now boasts several hundred ( mostly male ) employees , in offices around the world			1
violent : a man prowls the streets with a gun in @entity69 , which was released on tuesday at midnight the brothers dress like rap artists , in chunky jewellery and baggy sportswear , and are obsessed with the modish image of the firm which they claim to have modelled on @entity79 hip - hop record label @entity77			0
@entity19 , a dishevelled - looking , bearded 41 - year - old , is the ‘ ideas man ’ behind @entity27 and other games			1
the @entity81 once dubbed him ‘ a secretive , demanding workaholic [ with ] a temperament and a budget befitting a @entity86 mogul ’			0
@entity32 , who is balding and two years younger , writes the ‘ scripts ’ for @entity60			1
he lives in an 11 - bedroom mansion in @entity89 famed as the home where @entity91 wrote his 1958 novella breakfast at @entity93			2
together , the brothers preside over a highly colourful working environment			0
employees are encouraged to wear t - shirts and bomber jackets embossed with @entity60 ’s logo , and attend raucous company parties which have been jollified ( on at least one occasion ) by strippers wearing catholic school uniforms			1
@entity104 : the controversial video game involves attacking innocent people for fun in the book @entity109 , a history of @entity60 , author @entity108 details the firm ’s louche after - hours culture in eye - popping detail , telling , for example , how employees are encouraged to take part in ‘ cheese ball eating ’ contests			1
the night - time events , in which the @entity6 brothers put up £ 2,000 in prize money , require entrants to eat fist - sized balls of deep - fried cheese while wearing @entity128 - themed yellow headbands carrying the logo ‘ eat strong ’ ( a play on the cyclist ’s former charity @entity131 )			2
buckets are provided for them to vomit into , along with bottles of tequila to help clear palates			0
the ‘ company record ’ is believed to be held by a programmer who scoffed 24 cheese balls at one sitting			0
these lively — if somewhat juvenile — soirees are said to contribute to the atmosphere of extreme creativity at @entity60 , which prides itself on its ability , as executives like to say , to ‘ think outside the box ’			1
among the many ‘ eureka ’ moments which led to @entity27 ’s success was an innovation ( introduced for the third instalment of the game , released in 2001 ) allowing players to increase their character ’s ‘ health ’ by having sex with a prostitute			1
@entity69 : the latest game went on sale on tuesday at midnight popular : fans queue at @entity162 's flagship store in @entity163 in @entity5 for a copy of @entity69 they could then advance in the game by beating or murdering the prostitute and stealing her money			2
in the parallel universe of video game culture , that apparently counts as an epoch - defining innovation			2
in addition to their reputation for inventiveness , the housers are also famed for their gruelling work ethic and commitment to perfectionism			0
tales of the demands they place on staff , most of whom work 70 - hour weeks , abound			0
a few years ago , for example , @entity185 , a former assistant to @entity28 , alleged to the @entity81 that he once called her a ‘ whore ’ and a ‘ c * * * ’ when she brought him the wrong kind of bagel for breakfast			1
in another controversial incident , the actor @entity192 — one of many @entity86 stars who have done voiceover work for @entity60 — threatened to punch @entity32 after being asked to re-record a line for what he was told would be a forthcoming ‘ hit game ’			1
‘ there ’s going to be two hits here , ’ @entity192 said			0
‘ me hitting you , and you hitting the floor			0
’ one company staffer claimed that @entity19 was famous for throwing — and breaking — office telephones , and that he was ‘ prone to screaming , insisting on marathon work hours and rarely dispensing praise ’			1
worldwide popularity : @entity60 released @entity69 worldwide on tuesday			1
this billboard is on the side of the @entity211 in @entity212 one industry analyst has publicly compared the brothers to ‘ the kids on the island in @entity217 ’			0
in 2007 , two @entity60 employees committed suicide — though it ’s not thought their deaths were related to the company in any way			1
shortly afterwards , the @entity172 attempted to improve the atmosphere in the workplace by hiring a spiritual healer to perform an exorcism on their office			0
‘ wearing a long , flowing garment , with an assistant in tow , the woman strode through the office swinging crystals from a string as she moved from desk to desk , ’ the @entity81 later revealed			0
surprisingly , given their track records , the @entity6 brothers hail from the most blue - chip of backgrounds			0
their mother was @entity242 , the upper - crust @entity243 actress who played @entity244 in the 1971 film @entity246 , a role that required her to cavort naked in bed with @entity249			0
the brothers were educated at top public school @entity250 ’s , in @entity5 , where fees are £ 30,000 a year			2
they would be collected at the school gates in their father ’s @entity254			0
@entity19 was a classmate of the chancellor @entity256			1
brutal : a torture victim has his teeth pulled out by pliers in a scene from the newly released @entity69 peers say he wore @entity263 boots with his school uniform , was obsessed with gangster movies and hip - hop and that his a-level results were underwhelming			0
@entity32 , who was more academic , went on to read geography at @entity269			0
after leaving school , @entity19 was hired by record label @entity271 , where he worked on the launch of the @entity273 with pop svengali @entity274 and directed the video for @entity276 ’s 1992 debut , @entity277			1
his big break came three years later when he was working in the firm ’s interactive division			0
a @entity282 company called @entity283 pitched a potential game called @entity285 in which players could be cops or robbers			2
he tinkered with the format , forcing gamers to play gangsters , rather than policemen , and re-named it @entity27 the game launched in 1997			1
shortly afterwards , @entity271 sold off its gaming division and @entity6 co-founded @entity60 , bringing his brother on board and taking control of one of the most lucrative franchises in gaming history			2
disturbing : the same victim receives a series of electric shocks in the game , which has drawn criticism for its violence in the early days , @entity27 ’s success was built on its notoriety			1
@entity19 hired publicist @entity310 to drum up controversy over the game and boasted of how gamers could ‘ run bagfuls of [ the drug ] speed to a member of @entity318 ’s hooker ’			1
yet after a series of high - profile scandals in the @entity79 , where the @entity324 shootings and several other mass murders were blamed on violent video games , the brothers found themselves under heavy fire			0
their nadir came in 2005 , when they were denounced by senator @entity329 and called before the @entity330 when a secret , hardcore pornographic scene was discovered in the 2004 game @entity27 : @entity333			1
the @entity330 ’s lawsuit , along with a string of other cases brought by regulators and gamers , cost hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
since then , the brothers have attempted to withdraw from the public eye , giving just a handful of interviews in which they appear to be attempting to re-style themselves as right - thinking businessmen			0
‘ i ’m the most conservative guy you ’ll ever meet , ’ @entity19 — who is married with two children — told one reporter			2
‘ i have a panic attack if i even get a parking ticket			0
’ in the immoral world of @entity27 , on which the duo ’s empire is built , that sort of attitude would surely mean instant @entity357 .			1

each have built personal fortunes estimated at £ 50million thanks to the game
