@entity0 believes @entity1 deserves a warm welcome this weekend when he makes his first return to @entity4 since being sacked by @entity5			1
over the course of nearly four years in north @entity10 , the 67 - year - old transformed @entity5 from relegation candidates to regular @entity8 contenders			1
it was the most successful period of @entity5 ' recent history but @entity1 was shown the door in june 2012 after a promising season tailed off amid widespread links to the @entity17 hotseat			1
return : @entity1 will be back at @entity4 on sunday , where he spent four successful years respect : @entity1 should get a good reception according to @entity21 after his achievements with @entity5 @entity23 and @entity24 have come and gone since then , with @entity1 still the only man to have led @entity5 into the @entity8			1
it is that success which makes @entity21 confident that the sometimes divisive , always outspoken manager will get a decent welcome when he brings @entity29 to @entity4 on sunday			1
' he was one of the most successful managers the club has had , with him getting the club into the @entity8 , so he should get a good reception , ' said the left - back			1
' in terms of the football he had the team playing , he got the best out of @entity41 , the best out of @entity43 , and lot of players , so i think he should get a warm welcome			2
' @entity29 lost against @entity48 on the opening day of the season but we know it will be a difficult game			2
@entity5 connection : @entity1 and coach @entity54 are both former @entity5 manager up against it : @entity21 says it will be a difficult game against @entity29 but hopes his side can pick up the win ' with an old manager coming back , they will be looking to get three points			1
it will be a very hard game but games at home we should be looking to get three points			2
' victory against @entity29 would continue a fine start to life at the helm for @entity70			2
coaxed to @entity4 after an impressive 18 months at @entity72 , the @entity29 match will be the former @entity74 defender 's first competitive match at @entity4 and comes fresh from leading @entity5 to back - to - back victories at @entity76 and @entity77			1
' i spoke to @entity79 at @entity72 before i met the manager and he had nothing but nice things to say about him , ' @entity21 said			2
' it is hard work but i am enjoying working under him			2
he is like one of the lads , having a laugh , but everyone knows that as soon as training starts he is very serious			0
' all he demands is hard work and that is exactly what he has got form everyone throughout pre-season			0
' flying start : @entity70 has enjoyed an impressive opening two games with wins against @entity76 and @entity77 @entity70 's demanding approach is well - documented and one which @entity5 will hope bears fruit as they take on @entity29 just days after an energy - sapping trip to @entity109			1
a bobbly , cut - up pitch and temperatures in the 30s made life difficult for the north @entity114 , who looked set to lose to an early @entity77 goal from @entity117 in the first leg of their @entity120 play - off			0
however , the introduction of @entity122 midway through the second half turned the game , the schemer setting up @entity126 and @entity127 within eight minutes of coming on to secure an unlikely 2 - 1 win			0
having a laugh : @entity122 is beginning to settle in at @entity5 and his performances are improving it was a belated glimpse of the quality which saw @entity5 fork out a club - record fee last summer and , after a difficult debut season , @entity21 is confident the @entity135 will prove his worth this term			1
' we were allowed a night out in @entity138 and we all saw a different side to him , ' he said			0
' he really came out of his shell and was having a laugh and a joke with everybody			0
' i was warming up with him last night and you could tell he was raring to get on the pitch			0
' he did well to assist @entity147 for the first and then was involved in the second			0
we are all happy for him			0
' he has got a lot of quality , especially going forward			0
he will be looking forward to showing everyone what he can do this season			0
