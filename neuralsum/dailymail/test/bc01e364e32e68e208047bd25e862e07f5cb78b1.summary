@entity3 's @entity2 semi-final defeat has put the club under scrutiny and guaranteed this campaign will be judged a failure			1
the burning ambition at @entity9 is for @entity3 to be @entity11 regulars with the potential to win the @entity13			1
but , after a wretched day against @entity15 , they are clearly some way from realising that dream			2
are @entity3 heading for mediocrity ? or is there sufficient talent to ensure the mistakes are corrected and progress can be resumed ? a huge summer beckons and there is no margin for error			1
@entity27 opens the scoring for @entity3 against @entity15 with a smart chipped finish at @entity30 @entity32 ( centre ) scores for @entity15 to make it 1 - 1 and start @entity37 's side 's recovery @entity39 midfielder @entity38 fires in @entity15 's second goal to win the game and book a place in the @entity2 final for all the praise that came @entity47 ’ way last season , when he masterminded an unexpected and thrilling challenge for the title , the manager must accept criticism			1
like his team , he has underperformed			2
yes , he deserved credit for arresting a mid-winter slump			2
it was smart to change @entity3 ’s formation to 3 - 4 - 3 , sparking an impressive 13 - game unbeaten run in the league			1
but he has not made a mark on the games that matter			2
at @entity30 we saw a prime example			0
he switched systems ( from 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 to 4 - 3 - 3 to 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) but @entity3 never found a rhythm			1
this was not an isolated case			0
changes had to be made after a poor start during the 1 - 1 draw with @entity71 that led to @entity3 ’s exit from the @entity11			1
there have been other issues			0
picking an experimental line - up in the @entity76 against @entity77 last november was perplexing			0
he was outwitted by @entity79 when @entity80 visited in march — it was a mistake not to start @entity82 — and @entity84 ’s signing has given @entity47 a problem that he has not been able to solve all season			1
@entity47 is innovative , thorough and , crucially , still learning his trade			1
his teams can have style and he has absolute faith in his ability			0
so , too , do @entity92 , @entity3 ’s owners			1
his future is n’t even up for consideration			0
but that does n’t mean the pressure is off			2
managing @entity3 comes with great expectation and @entity47 must provide the right answers come august			1
then there are questions about the club ’s transfer committee			1
it grates at @entity9 how much focus is put on the committee , which comprises @entity47 , chief executive @entity108 , @entity109 , the head of recruitment , chief scout @entity112 , @entity113 , the director of technical performance , and @entity92 investor @entity115			1
yet of the 17 players they have bought at considerable cost over the last two summers , only three — @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity122 — could be said to have delivered			2
@entity125 and @entity126 , on loan at @entity128 and @entity129 respectively , remain unknown quantities but many have been duds , such as @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity84 and @entity135			0
others — @entity137 and @entity138 — look overawed			0
this is another world to @entity140			0
@entity47 looks dejected as @entity3 crash out of the @entity2 after a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity15 @entity3 manager @entity47 ( far right ) addresses his players during sunday 's game at @entity30 wasting money in the market is not a new failing — @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 made mistakes — but this is on a new level			1
if @entity47 is under pressure , then so are the men recommending players			1
@entity92 do not accept failure lightly			0
they have dispensed with two managers ( @entity150 and @entity151 ) and one director of football ( @entity160 ) since taking over in 2010 and will not hesitate to act if they feel things are going askew			0
@entity82 is going , @entity162 will follow , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 are out of contract			0
@entity168 has no @entity9 future and nor does @entity84			1
@entity170 must leave to get regular football			0
@entity172 may choose to pursue a new challenge			0
@entity174 is at loggerheads with @entity3 over the new deal he has been offered			1
@entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 have 12 months left on their contracts			0
@entity3 have agreed a new deal with @entity179 but @entity178 is thinking about what he has been offered			1
@entity123 is one of only three players signed over the last two years that have impressed this season @entity122 has played with a mature head that belies his tender years since joining from @entity189 put all that together and it does n’t paint a settled picture			2
@entity47 did not want another window like last summer ’s , with a raft of new faces , but that looks unavoidable			1
signing the right players is key but in the likely event of not being able to offer @entity11 football , how easy will that be ? concluding deals has been a serious problem			2
in the past two years , @entity3 have tried to sign @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 without success			1
@entity207 is on their radar , as is @entity210 ’s @entity209 , the 21 - year - old @entity211 winger valued at £ 25million			0
@entity213 ’s wages are out of @entity3 ’s range			1
they will also look to bring in a striker , but do clubs in upheaval make smooth progress ? no. absent at @entity30 , just as he has been for much of the season , was @entity221			0
it has been a wretched campaign for the @entity39 forward , one decimated by calf and thigh issues			0
missing the semi-final will have done nothing to help his mental state			0
without @entity231 , this should have been the year @entity221 took centre stage			0
can he do it next season ? he has the ability and goalscoring instinct but he will be no use to @entity47 if he is not fit for the major games			1
@entity84 ( centre ) is one of a number of @entity3 signings that have failed to impress this season @entity162 was sent on as a late sub for @entity244 on sunday is expected to leave the club this summer @entity47 is keen for @entity207 , pictured in 2012 , to help fill the void left by the outgoing @entity82 and finally there is the squad ’s spirit and attitude			1
@entity251 has said one of the qualities of @entity3 ’s greatest sides was ‘ finding a way of winning ’ when the chips were down			2
that , however , was then , and now it is different			0
at @entity30 , it was clear the travelling @entity259 doubted the character of this squad			0
much focus has been put on @entity82 but it is risible to pin any blame on him for the defeat by @entity15			0
he did n’t have the swagger of youth but , even at 34 , he still looked the one who would save @entity3 , with a late header that was cleared off the line and a pinpoint ball to @entity84			2
he has set the example , so who will do it when he leaves ? there is a flaw in @entity3 ’s mindset			2
unless they toughen their resolve , they will continue to fall short			0
@entity47 has declared that losing can be a catalyst for success			2
in 12 months , he must hope his words are proven prophetic			0
@entity221 has spent much of the season watching from the stands due to a succession of injuries @entity3 's players , including their captain , were outclassed by @entity15 at @entity30 and deservedly lost			1

@entity47 needs a *positive* summer to restore *confidence* at @entity9
@entity3 's transfer committee under pressure to sign better players
@entity47 now also under scrutiny after being exposed in big matches
