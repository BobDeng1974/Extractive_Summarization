top secret : the @entity1 was a compulsory read for members of the @entity4 from the cyanide cigarette to the deadly briefcase , the gadgets that @entity6 presents @entity7 with in each of the spy films are crucial to his operations			1
but according to a real - life spy manual , @entity13 agents were using gadgets and devices which would give @entity7 a run for his money			2
the @entity1 – read and memorised by agents in 1944 and 1945 - reveals the secrets of how explosive rats , microfilm coded stilettos and exploding bottles of @entity25 were all used to defeat the enemy			2
members of the @entity4 ( @entity27 ) could choose from explosives hidden in fruit , wine bottles , coal , handbags and even rats , according to @entity34			0
disguises were also extensive and included make - up , customised women ’s clothing studied for accuracy from periodicals , and an early spray - tan that ‘ sprayed through a glass nozzle will … produce a brown stain that would last approximately three days in @entity44 ’			2
in the ‘ permanent removal ’ section the manual also boasts how tattoo removal and dental work was available to @entity4 agents and that ‘ an eminent plastic surgeon and his staff are at our disposal ’			1
collar - studs , buttons and high - heels could be tailored to carry codes or microfilm , and radio equipment was hidden in bundles of kindling , gramophone players and @entity65 clocks			0
in the introduction to the @entity68 @entity1 , published later this month , @entity66 writes : ‘ in the @entity7 films the visits to the gadget laboratory was always a moment of light relief			1
covert communications : one technique that was used by @entity68 spies was the camouflaged wireless radio , hidden among a bundle of kindling ( as seen above ) the idea for the ' exploding rat ' was first developed in 1941			1
the objective was to blow up the enemy 's boilers by lying the dead rat near @entity65 boiler rooms			0
enemy soldiers were expected to shovel the carcass into the flames to avoid disease - the the hidden bomb 's fuse would then be lit. but they were never used , as the first consignment was seized by the @entity65 , blowing the secret			0

the real life equivalent of @entity6 , the head of the fictional @entity112 in the @entity7 films , was @entity114 , who also played a key role in the creation and employment of @entity118 and the s - phone radio equipment for communications between @entity4 agents and troops on the ground			1
exploding rat : one suggested technique for enhancing explosive capabilities was to hide a bomb in a rat carcass - the idea was that @entity65 soldiers would burn the rodent in their boiler rooms causing an explosion @entity6 : @entity114 , who died in 2001 aged 90 , was responsible for inventing many devices used by @entity68 spies			1
