by @entity1 reporter published : 09:58 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 02:38 est , 7 october 2012 a bizarre feud between two families over who owned a £ 50,000 horse turned violent when three women were attacked with a whip in their own stables , a court heard			2
@entity10 , 71 , and her former stablehand @entity11 , 36 , had been rowing over valuable pure - bred mare @entity12 for over a year			1
yard owner ms @entity10 said she loaned breeding horse @entity12 to ms @entity11 but agreed the valuable horse would be kept on her property and @entity17 would visit to ride her			1
the contested horse : former stablehand @entity11 who claims she was given a valuable pure bred mare called @entity12 attacked : @entity20 , left , her daughter @entity22 , centre , and her granddaughter @entity23 who were assaulted by a friend of ms @entity11 , @entity25			1
ms @entity11 said she knew nothing about the incident but in august last year @entity12 , a @entity29 breed , disappeared from ms @entity10 ’s farm and turned up at another local stables			1
ms @entity11 claimed ms @entity10 had agreed to let the horse be moved elsewhere but ms @entity10 accused her of taking the animal without permission			1
ms @entity10 ’s family called police asking for help and begged ms @entity11 to return the horse , but to no avail			1
eventually fed - up ms @entity10 and her family hatched a late - night plan to get her prized horse back by lifting the gate at the stables of its hinges and walking the horse home			1
but the feud came to a head when ms @entity11 ’s close family friend @entity25 , 58 , broke into ms @entity10 ’s stables in @entity53 , @entity54 , in the early hours of august 11 this year			1
prized possession : the pure bred horse called @entity12 was worth £ 50,000 @entity57 heard @entity25 beat ms @entity10 , her daughter @entity22 , 43 , and granddaughter @entity23 , 17 , with a three - foot horse whip			1
the drunken attack only came to an end when @entity23 ’s fiance @entity62 , 20 , ran in shouting ‘ you do n’t hit women ’ and tied @entity25 up with a rope			2
@entity25 avoided jail on monday when he was handed a suspended sentence at @entity57 ’ @entity57 after admitting three counts of assault by beating			2
he was jailed for 160 days , but the sentence was suspended for two years			2
he was also ordered to do 150 hours ' unpaid work and must pay £ 250 compensation and £ 85 costs			0
ms @entity11 denies any involvement or knowledge of @entity25 's actions			1
but incredibly , both families now claim they have had the steed stolen from their stables by the other family			0
they are due to have another showdown in the courts after ms @entity11 lodged a private claim for the animal against ms @entity10			1
ms @entity11 , a mother - of - four who works as a cleaner , said : ' i kept @entity12 at @entity10 ’s stables for a while before asking if i could move her to another stables half a mile down the road			1
' then i started getting solicitors ’ letters saying i had to bring @entity12 back			2
she claimed the horse was on a life - time loan agreement			0
' i refused to give the horse back as i believed i rightfully owned her			2
ongoing battle : mother of four @entity11 , pictured with @entity12 , has made a private civil court claim for the horse against @entity99 - @entity10 ' we were good friends , i did some mucking out for her			1
she knew i could not afford a horse and i was extremely grateful that she gave me @entity12			2
' i do not know what made @entity10 change her mind			0
' i do not want to fight with the woman			0
it is sad that it has got like this			0
it has hit my family hard too , my children are very upset and i am suffering from stress			0
' she is making me out to be a horse thief and saying i do not look after horses properly			0
' both @entity11 , pictured with @entity12 and @entity20 claim to own the horse but great - grandmother - of - three ms @entity10 insists she is the victim and has not slept properly since being beaten with the horse whip			1
speaking after the hearing , ms @entity10 said : ' i have cctv on my stables and when i was woken by the dogs barking i was up in a flash			2
' i grabbed a three - foot schooling whip and went to see what was going on			0
' this big brute of a man was leaning on the stable door and when i asked him what he was doing he snatched the whip and starting hitting me with it			0
' i was lying on the ground in my nightie with my legs kicking			0
' i think he should have gone to prison and for a long time			0
i truly believe he came to get me and take the horse			0
' @entity22 , a fitness instructor , came to her mother ’s aid during the incident			0
after the court hearing she said : ' it must have been just after 1am			0
i could hear mum screaming and crying and thought ‘ the old girl has finally lost it			0
’ ' when i saw him [ @entity25 ] with the whip i thought i could calm the situation down but as soon as i went outside - and i was only wearing a long t - shirt and pair of knickers - he just punched me in the face			2
' the feud started last year when natural health scientist ms @entity10 , who owns the small livery yard and @entity29 stud farm , was forced to give up @entity12 when she was diagnosed with vertigo and doctors banned her from riding			1
she says she entrusted @entity12 with former employee ms @entity11 under the agreement that she would be able to monitor her care at her stables			1
but on the night of august 14 , 2011 , @entity12 , who ms @entity10 had owned for seven years and schooled for five , was taken from the farm			1
@entity160 ( above ) heard @entity25 beat ms @entity10 , her daughter @entity22 , 43 , and granddaughter @entity23 , 17 , with a three foot horse whip the horse was kept away from the farm at another stables for almost a year before ms @entity10 took her back on august 7 , 2012			1
ms @entity10 claims @entity12 was worth around £ 50,000 when she loaned her , but when she got her back she was lame and now only worth around £ 2,000			1
then just four days after winning back her horse ms @entity10 , her daughter and granddaughter were attacked by drunk @entity25 when he appeared in their stables			1
ms @entity10 and her daughter , who was left with a black eye and whip marks after the attack , have now installed infra - red cctv cameras at their home			2
she said : ' i was told it would cost me 15 to 30 grand in legal expenses to prosecute her for stealing my horse - so i had no choice but to get her back myself			0
' i put thousands of hours into schooling her and looking after her properly			0
' she added : ' she was worth £ 50 , 000 when i loaned her			0
now she is probably worth less than 2 , 000 - or just butcher meat			0
' it ’s unbelievable that i have to keep going to court to prove i own a horse which i clearly do and have all the paper work for			0
