by @entity0 published : 01:35 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 05:58 est , 25 april 2013 @entity2 veterans have protested after a new @entity4 second world war tourism campaign ignored one of the @entity7 beaches where @entity9 troops went ashore			1
six tourist boards along the @entity7 coast launched the new d - day initiative to promote what it calls the ' secteur mythique ' - or mythical sector where action took place			1
it stretches from @entity19 and @entity20 in the west to @entity22 and @entity24 beaches where @entity26 troops from the @entity27 , @entity9 and @entity28 went ashore			1
mark of respect : @entity32 veteran @entity31 ( centre ) , from @entity34 in @entity35 , plants a @entity37 flag in the sand on @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity7 , in 2004 never forget : normandy veteran @entity41 , then 85 , from @entity42 places a wooden remembrance plaque on what was the @entity9 sword beach at @entity45 on june 5 , 2009 near @entity46 , @entity4 but the campaign stops short of @entity39 in the east , where 700 @entity9 soldiers were killed or wounded on june 6 , 1944			1
@entity39 was the code name given by @entity26 commanders to one of the five main landing areas along the @entity7 coast during the d - day landings , or @entity56 as it is sometimes known			1
it stretches roughly five miles from @entity59 to @entity60			2
it was the eastern-most beach of the @entity7 landings			2
the @entity26 forces most heavily involved in the assault on @entity39 were the @entity65			2
various brigades were attached to the main assault group			0
significant , and emblematic from a @entity4 standpoint , was the inclusion of the 1st @entity70 within which was comprised the @entity71			0
from the @entity74 ' point of view , it was important and highly symbolic that @entity4 forces should be included as part of the @entity77 , contributing to the liberation of their own country			0
after the initial landings on @entity39 , @entity9 troops moved off the beach and pushed inland towards @entity46			2
sword was the most easterly of the landing beaches			2
@entity9 troops also landed at beaches codenamed @entity24 and @entity22 near @entity87 and @entity88 a massive flotilla of boats was organised to carry troops across the @entity92 to @entity7 on june 6 , 1944 @entity20 secured after d - day , 1944			1
the beach where @entity27 troops landed is part of the so - called ' secteur mythique ' @entity99 in @entity7 where @entity74 landed in the @entity7 invasion the website @entity101 is running a campaign for the @entity4 tourist boards to include @entity39 in their promotion one of those veterans who went ashore , @entity107 signaller @entity106 , now 88 , told of his dismay at the decision			1
he said : ' a lot lost their lives in that area			0
it seems to be an insult to their memory to leave them out			0
if you are going to promote some of the beaches , you should promote them all			2
' the tourist board decision has also been criticised by the local regional council of @entity125 as well as the @entity4 @entity126 and d - day committee associations			1
it was a rousing battle cry for @entity9 troops about to risk their lives on @entity2			0
written by their commander in chief general sir @entity131 , the stirring words were delivered to tens of thousands of men on the eve of the @entity2 in 1944			0
' good luck to each one of you , ' he declared			0
' and good hunting on the main land of @entity141			0
' @entity131 instructed unit commanders to read the words ' to all troops ' to inspire them as they prepared to take on @entity146 's military might			0
on june 6 some 135,000 @entity26 soldiers landed on five beaches – codenamed @entity24 , @entity149 , @entity22 , @entity20 and @entity19			1
by the end of the ferocious fighting on what was immortalised in film as the @entity155 , around 4,000 @entity74 troops had been killed – but the invaders had secured a foothold in @entity141			0
the rousing speech ends with the poignant line ' good luck to each one of you			0
and good hunting on the main land of @entity141 '			0
@entity131 also quotes the famous lines of @entity165 nobleman and @entity167 soldier @entity166 : he either fears his fate too much , or his deserts are small , that dares not put it to the touch , to gain or lose it all			0
the latter two d - day organisations already support tourism and commemorations for all municipalities right along all sectors of the d - day normandy beaches , recognising the contribution and sacrifice of troops of all nationalities			1
they have been remembering @entity2 for almost 70 years , 2014 marking the 70th anniversary of the @entity2			0
towns associated with @entity39 have also expressed their strong dissatisfaction with the tourist boards ' decision which they say has everything to do with tourism and nothing to do with history			1
a spokesman for @entity194 website , @entity195 , @entity196 , slammed the decision , saying : ' with such an initiative , six tourist offices ... develop history tourism without worrying about history			2
' what they consider is money			0
the @entity27 sector and the town of @entity87 ( included in this so - called ' mythical sector ' ) attract more than 85 per cent of the @entity194 tourists			1
' instead of making an effort on @entity39 and the @entity211 drop zones , these six tourist offices just care about the most popular areas			1
' what will @entity9 and @entity4 veterans who landed at @entity214 on @entity2 think ? what will be the thoughts of those who were parachuted northeast of @entity219 ? ' what about their fallen comrades , killed to free a piece of land that is not considered " mythical " enough according to these six tourist offices ? ' mr @entity196 has demanded an urgent re-think by the six @entity7 tourist boards involved , calling upon them to cancel the ' @entity229 ' project as it 's presently configured			1
a petition has also been launched by @entity195 calling for the abandonment of what they see as a tourist project disrespectful to the fallen heroes of @entity39			2
this year 's general assembly of the landings organising committee - the @entity239 - confirmed the 69th annual d - day commemoration events will centre on @entity241 , honouring @entity27 troops who took part in the d - day landings on the adjacent @entity20 beach .			1
