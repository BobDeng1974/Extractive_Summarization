but now @entity9 supermodel @entity20 can add pioneer to her lengthy cv			2
the model has become the first @entity2 to feature on the cover of @entity0 - a groundbreaking development for the fashion glossy			1
in the @entity27 , @entity4 has been photographed for the cover of @entity6 and has featured in fashion editorial in @entity29			1
groundbreaking : the january cover of @entity0 features @entity9 supermodel , @entity20 @entity31 : @entity9 supermodel @entity20 poses for the shoot in @entity0 the model also made her international catwalk debut in @entity27 when she walked for @entity35 and up - and - coming designer @entity36 in september 2009			1
since then @entity20 has walked for a veritable who 's who of big names , with appearances on the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and 3.1 @entity45 catwalks among many others			0
the model has also landed starring roles in some of the biggest beauty campaigns on the planet , including becoming the face of @entity54 's @entity53 fragrance and @entity15 's one			0
although @entity4 and her compatriot , fellow @entity9 supermodel @entity11 , have previously featured in @entity59 @entity0 editorial , this is the first time that an @entity2 model has made the cover of the @entity59 glossy			1
@entity64 was the first @entity65 magazine to include an @entity2 model on its cover , when @entity11 appeared on an issue in 2011			1
tribute : shot by @entity71 , the shoot is an homage to the legendary @entity74 model @entity75 @entity76 major : @entity20 has also taken pride of place on the cover of @entity6 as well as starring roles in @entity54 and @entity15 campaigns catwalk queen : @entity20 's runway credits include @entity85 ( left ) and @entity86 ( right ) it 's famous for its conservative culture but @entity91 models are quickly catching up with their @entity9 counterparts in terms of demand from big names			1

asked by the @entity103 to describe the reaction to her burgeoning career back home , @entity102 said : ' mostly , i have had positive reactions			0
most people think it 's good to have a @entity98 model			0
i have had just a few bad reactions from people , but i do n't mind - i 'm happy what i 'm doing			0
' @entity27 and @entity115 have yet to follow suit by featuring an @entity2 model as a cover girl - but both titles are known for their use of celebrity cover models rather than catwalk stalwarts			1
both , however , have featured @entity2 models in their fashion editorial			2
indeed , @entity125 's @entity115 caused controversy with an all - @entity2 shoot two years ago			0
the @entity129 shoot , which was styled by flame - haired fashion director , @entity130 , and appeared in the december 2010 issue , was accused of being ' tokenist ' , while others questioned the premise that @entity2 models are ' redefining traditional concepts of beauty '			2
' traditional concepts of beauty where , exactly ? ' asked @entity139 blogger , @entity140			0
' because there are plenty of places in the world where , traditionally speaking , @entity2 women have long been considered beautiful			0
like in , um , @entity76 , for example ? ' @entity64 is no stranger to race - related controversy either , with the @entity7 glossy causing an uproar in october 2009 when it published an editorial shoot that included images of white models with blacked up faces			2
the shoot , which featured @entity157 model @entity156 , passed unnoticed in @entity7 but caused a storm in the @entity159 , with critics describing it as ' culturally insensitive ' and ' a step back in time ' .			2
