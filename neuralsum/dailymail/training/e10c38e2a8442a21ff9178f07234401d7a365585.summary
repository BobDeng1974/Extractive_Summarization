two vets 150 miles apart told of shocking animal abuse cases today which saw one kitten hurled from a car window and two more abandoned in a bush			1
ten - week - old @entity6 had to have his face stitched together and smashed teeth removed after being thrown from a vehicle near @entity10 , @entity11			1
and in @entity15 , @entity12 , @entity13 and wonder may never see again after being abandoned and developing a severe eye infection			1
the two cases were also revealed today alongside that of @entity35 , a moggy so neglected he had to be completely shaved and have his rotting teeth removed in @entity39 , north @entity40			1
in the first case , vets have revealed photos of ten - week - old kitten hammond after he had to have his face stitched together			1
the black cat suffered deep cuts to his nose and shattered teeth after being thrown from the window of a moving car on the @entity53 last week near @entity10 , @entity11			1
he underwent painstaking surgery to remove all his broken teeth , including two canines that had been pushed into his jaw			0
it is thought the people in the car he was thrown from had hoped the vehicle behind would run him over			2
injured : it is believed @entity6 's owners intended the car behind them to run him over			2
instead , the driver swerved in time , picked the cat off the road and rushed with it covered in blood to the nearest vet 's surgery @entity73 said : ' his nose was hardly recognisable and many of his teeth had been shattered on impact ' instead the driver collected @entity6 from the roadside before taking him to the rescue centre , covered in blood			0
@entity80 , assistant manager at the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity11 , said : ' his face was in a really bad way			2
' his nose was hardly recognisable and many of his teeth had been shattered upon impact with the road			0
' he ’s a very lucky boy though			0
if the car behind had not swerved he would have gone straight under their wheels			0
' thankfully he has recovered well from both operations			0
it ’s nice to know that , in a world where such devastating animal cruelty exists , there are still so many animal lovers out there			0
' @entity6 's plight was so desperate that he has already been adopted - but the rescue centre still needs more information to bring a prosecution against his attackers			0
in the second case , meanwhile , three - month - olds @entity13 and @entity14 may have to have their eyes removed after being abandoned by the seafront in @entity15 , @entity12			1
looking for a home : in a second case revealed today , three - month - old siblings @entity13 and wonder may have to have their eyes removed after being abandoned by the seafront in @entity15 , @entity12 @entity110 said : ' they are beautiful			1
wonder is likely to lose both eyes , and @entity13 will lose one ' the kitten siblings were discovered cowering in a bush by dog walkers and are now looking for a new home , despite having severe eye infections			2
@entity110 , who works at @entity119 in @entity15 , @entity12 , said : ' the kittens are now being taken care of and are being given eye drops daily			2
they are eating and drinking and doing quite well			0
' they are beautiful little things			0
wonder is likely to lose both eyes , and @entity13 will lose one , but they are both affectionate , lovely and friendly animals			2
' it has been very distressing for both of these animals , and now we are concentrating on getting the cats ready for the operation and then finding them a new home			0
' she added : ' we are hoping that it will be a happy ending for these two now , but if they had n’t have been found they could easily have died			0
' there is never any reason to just dump an animal , as people who ca n’t cope can always call the @entity145 or other charities who offer shelter for cats			1
' abused : the pair of kittens were found cowering in a bush by a passing dog walker and were rescued compassionate : student vet @entity155 with @entity13 and @entity14			1
