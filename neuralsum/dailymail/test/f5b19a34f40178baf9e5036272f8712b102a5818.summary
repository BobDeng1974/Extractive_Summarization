a bolt of lightning has been spotted soaring from the top of a cloud before looping back on itself and striking the ground in @entity6			1

upwards lightning is possible , but is very rare - with current estimates suggesting less than one per cent of lightning strikes travelling in an ‘ upwards ’ direction			2

upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than 1 % of lightning travels in an ‘ upwards ’ direction			2
but storm chaser @entity18 said ' looped ' lighting may instead be a trick of perspective , based on where a viewer is stood , meaning it appears to loop when it 's not the ' looping lightning ' image was taken by @entity27 and the bolt appears to shot out and up from the cloud before curving towards the @entity45			1
typically lightning is seen from a distance , or from the side , and it is rare to capture an image almost directly beneath a bolt			1
as a result , this can skew its perspective			2
in particular , if the bolt is travelling straight at the viewer - so they are almost looking up the length of the bolt - it can make it appear as if it is curving because of its forked nature			0
there have been examples of lightning appearing to make complete circular loops , but this is also a trick of the eye			0
@entity70 is caused by the build up of electrostatic charge in clouds			1
as they develop , air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud , and between the cloud and the ground			1
upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to @entity45 , and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds			1
the preceding flash causes an electrical field change , which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object like a building or wind turbine			0
during winter snow storms , it is possible for tall objects to initiate upwards lightning without preceding flashes			0
upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an ‘ upwards ’ direction			0
it is typically classified into three groups			0
the smallest are starters , which extend up to a altitude of 12 to 19 miles ( 20 to 30km )			0
next are jets , which extend 25 to 31 miles ( 40 to 50km ) , and the last are gigantic jets , which reach 44 to 56 miles ( 70 to 90km )			0
positive charge builds up in one area of the cloud , while negative charges build up in the other - typically the top and bottom of the cloud respectively			1
if this build up of charge reaches a certain level , the insulating capacity of the air breaks causing the negative charges to escape or ' leap ' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground			1
as negative charges gather in the bottom of a cloud , the negative charges in the ground are forced from the surface , leaving it positive			1
when a so - called ' streamer ' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud , it is therefore attracted to the ground , which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up			1
in particular , the negative ' stepped leaders ' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to @entity45 , with the least resistance			2
this is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud			0
as the streams connect it causes electrons to jump , or ' return the stroke ' , and an electrical current begins flowing , which creates lightning			0
this flash temporarily equalises the charged regions , until the opposite charges build up again			1
@entity70 can occur between opposite charges within the thunderstorm cloud , known as intra-cloud lightning , or between opposite charges in the cloud and on the ground , referred to as cloud - to - ground lightning			1
and there are roughly five to 10 times as many cloud flashes as there are cloud - to - ground flashes			2
within these strikes are two types of ground flashes known as natural and triggered			0
the latter includes strikes to very tall structures , planes , rockets and towers and goes from the ground up to the cloud			2
natural lightning is cloud to ground			2
upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to @entity45 , and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds			1
the preceding flash causes an electrical field change , which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object			0
upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an ‘ upwards ’ direction - and it is typically classified into three groups , based on peak altitude			0
the smallest are starters , which extend up to a maximum altitude of 12 to 19 miles ( 20 to 30km )			0
next are jets , which extend 25 to 31 miles ( 40 to 50km ) , and the last are gigantic jets , which reach 44 to 56 miles ( 70 to 90km )			0
@entity70 is caused by a build up of electrostatic charges			1
as they develop , air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud , and between the cloud and the ground			1
if this build up reaches a certain level , the insulating capacity of the air breaks			2
the negative charge ' leaps ' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground ( pictured ) when a so - called ' streamer ' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud , it is attracted to the ground , which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up			1
in particular , the negative ' stepped leaders ' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to @entity45 , with the least resistance			2
this is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud ( pictured ) however , the upward movement of the lightning in mr @entity27 's image does n't appear to extend as high as other forms of upward lightning , and storm chaser @entity18 suggests an alternative			1
he explained : ' sometimes a lightning channel will have the illusion of ' looping back ' on itself or having bright knots in it			1
the reason behind this phenomenon is quite simple			0
' @entity70 is three - dimensional - it ' zigs ' and ' zags ' in all directions			2
as the streams connect , it causes electrons to jump , or ' return the stroke ' , and an electrical current begins flowing , which creates lightning			0
this flash temporarily equalises the charged regions , until the opposite charges build up again			1
upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to @entity45 , and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds upward lightning is typically classified into three groups			1
starters extend up to an altitude of 19 miles ( 30km ) , jets extend to 31 miles ( 50km ) , and the gigantic jets reach up to 56 miles ( 90km )			0
the upward movement in mr @entity27 's image does n't appear to extend this high , however , and storm chaser @entity18 said if part of a bolt is coming straight at you , it will appear to loop back on itself even when it 's not ' most of the time you 'll view a lightning channel from the side and it 'll appear to travel in one general direction only			1
' however , if that lightning bolt - or part of the lightning bolt - is coming straight at you , that is , you are looking at it from one end			1
it will appear to loop back on itself , sometimes even appearing go back upwards			0
' the bright knots in a lightning channel you sometimes see in lightning photographs are the result of the same phenomenon - they are just smaller , tighter ' loops '			2
it appears brighter because there is more than one section of lightning channel ' overlapping ' in the camera 's frame			0
' the @entity295 's lightning expert @entity294 told @entity296 : ' on the particular photo it seems that the upper part of the channel may be pointed towards the observer			0
' in such perspective the upward movement of the horizontal channel may be more amplified - the approaching horizontal channel seems to rise higher in the sky as approaching plane seems to rise higher above the horizon although its real altitude does not change			0
' the map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013			0
areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple ; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer ( 0.4 square miles ) - are bright pink			0
the @entity322 was found to have the most over the period			0

image was taken by emergency services officer @entity27 who dubbed the phenomenon ' looping lightning '
a bolt of lightning is shown leaving the top of the cloud before looping back towards the @entity45
@entity70 is caused when positive and negative charges build up in a cloud to a level where one leaps to the other
as a result lightning has been seen striking the ground from a cloud and vice versa , and can move between clouds
