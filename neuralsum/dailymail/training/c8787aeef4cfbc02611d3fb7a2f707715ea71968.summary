by @entity0 published : 17:54 est , 9 march 2014 updated : 06:22 est , 10 march 2014 @entity2 , 2 , of @entity3 , @entity4 , keeps saying ' f * * * ' after watching an episode of @entity7 in which one of the characters appears to say ' f * * * * * * gazelles ' like most little girls her age , @entity12 loves everything to do with @entity7			1
so her mother , @entity16 , 30 , thought there was no harm in indulging her daughter by letting her watch the cartoon each day			1
but when @entity2 , two , began regularly using the f - word she was horrified to learn the tot had picked it up from her favourite @entity7 dvd			1
miss @entity12 had bought her daughter the cartoon for @entity26 , but it was n't until @entity29 's older brother sat down to watch the dvd with her last month that she realised the youngster had copied the bad language from the television			1
in the episode , named @entity35 , @entity33 is telling @entity36 about @entity7 's school teacher @entity37 , who used to play in a pop group			2
he says the name of the rock band , which is supposed to be the ' @entity41 , ' but miss @entity12 claims it sounds like he is saying the ' f - ing gazelles			1
' last night miss @entity12 demanded the dvd be pulled from sale until the mistake could be rectified			1
' my childminder came home from shopping with @entity49 one day and told me that had been saying ' f - ing ' when she saw @entity7 toys in a shop , ' miss @entity12 said			1
' i 'm a responsible parent and never swear in front of my kids , so i could n't understand where it had come from			0
' then , a few days later my boy , @entity57 , was watching @entity7 with @entity2 and came running down the stairs to tell me he had heard it on her dvd			2
we watched it again and i was mortified			0
' we realised she was just copying what she had seen on the television			0
' the damage has been done , ' miss @entity12 , a mother - of - four , from @entity4 , added			1
' i do n't really care what @entity33 is meant to be saying , to anyone who is watching it sounds like f - ing. @entity7 is immensely popular with young children , with the series spawning toys , clothes , dvds and other commodities ' it has caused me a lot of embarrassment			2
@entity49 can only say a handful of words , so it was all the more shocking that one of her first was the f - word			1
' you do n't expect language like that in a @entity96 , it 's disgusting			0
' @entity98 things are supposed to come out of children 's mouths , not that			0
' i 've tried not to make a big deal of it and now she knows that it is naughty			0
but i feel like she is being punished for something that 's not her fault			0
i feel bad because i gave her the dvd to watch but i 've had to tell her off because of it			0
' miss @entity12 said that @entity2 , and her twin sister , @entity111 , who suffers from cerebral palsy , were both born severely premature , at just 26 weeks , so when she decided to move them into their own bedroom just before @entity26 it was a ' big deal			2
' ' we decided to decorate their room with everything @entity7 because it was a big deal them being in a bedroom , ' she added			2
' now i just want it all gone , i do n't want @entity7 , she 's got to go			0
' no - one from @entity126 was available last night for comment .			0

@entity12 from @entity4 regularly started using the f - word at the age of 2
her mother @entity16 claims that she picked it up from her @entity7 dvd
creator claims that the girl learned it from misunderstanding a line
