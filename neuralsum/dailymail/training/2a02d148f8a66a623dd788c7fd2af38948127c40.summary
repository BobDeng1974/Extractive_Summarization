@entity1 investigators have found proof that a shipwreck found off northern @entity4 could not be the @entity5 , the lost flagship from @entity8 ' first voyage to the @entity9 , as a @entity11 explorer had claimed			1
@entity12 said a team of experts who explored the site at the request of the @entity4 government determined the wreckage was from a more recent vessel for reasons that included the discovery of copper nails and spikes at the site			2
the @entity5 would have used components of iron or wood , the agency said			1
@entity8 on @entity5 in 1492 , in a paiting by @entity31 from 1855			1
experts now believe they have discovered the wreck of the ship off the coast of @entity4			1
the @entity5 was believed to be a 58 ft ( 17.7 m ) long boat , described as ' very little larger than 100 toneladas ' ( about 100 tons , or tuns )			1
it was used as the flagship for the expedition , along with the smaller ships @entity42 , remembered as @entity43 ( ' the girl ' ) , and @entity45 ( ' @entity46 ' )			2
all three of the ships were second - hand ( if not third or more ) and were not intended for exploration			2
the report , which the agency said was conducted in a ' neutral and scientific manner , ' found that it is possible the actual wreckage may be buried under what is now land because of heavy sedimentation from nearby rivers			1
@entity11 explorer @entity59 had announced in may that he believed that he may have found the @entity5 near the city of @entity62 in what would have been a major archaeological find			1
the ship struck a reef and was abandoned by @entity8 in december 1492 and about two dozen crew members were left behind			1
last month , @entity4 's culture minister told @entity69 that preliminary research indicated that the ship was not the @entity5 and @entity59 said that he expected that the @entity72 report would raise doubts			1
he stood by his claim monday , calling the @entity72 report flawed because the agency 's experts did not consult him or the photos and charts he and his associates made of the wreckage site			1
@entity59 also said the copper components could have been used on the @entity5 or the material came from another shipwreck that cross-contaminated the site in an area where a number of ships are known to have sunk			1
the explorer had reached his conclusion based on the location of the wreckage , the presence of the type of stones used for ballast in that era as well as a type of cannon that was there when he first took photos of the site but had apparently been looted when he returned this year			1
' all of this information i would have made available to @entity72 and they never asked me for it , ' he said by phone from @entity109 , @entity110			2
in its report , @entity72 faulted @entity59 for announcing his findings in the media before officially informing the @entity4 government of his intention to continue his research in the bay of @entity62			1
the explorer said he had a permit			1
earlier this year @entity121 - @entity11 historian , @entity120 , who has spent 20 years tracing the ship , claimed it was run aground and used as accommodation before finally being burnt by natives			1
he believes the @entity5 was purposely dragged up onto the beach of @entity127 , re-christened @entity128 and ordered shot side - to - side by a cannonball on january 2 , 1493			1
' this cannonball intentionally disabled and marooned the @entity5 , ' claims @entity132			1
he believes @entity8 had to maroon the @entity5 for three reasons : so that those left behind could not follow him home , so that @entity135 was forced to send a rescue fleet , and because the @entity5 would have been highly dangerous to sail back through the winter seas of the @entity138			1
he also claims in the book ' @entity8 - @entity141 ' , which is currently looking for an @entity143 publisher , the explorer made sure to take back all the pilots with him , so that , if those marooned could repair the hole in the ship ’s hull , they would not know how to reach @entity135			1
' all of @entity8 ’s actions were calculated to prevent scrutiny , hide his tracks and allow for @entity121 to control the spice trade of @entity153 , while denying @entity135 access to that same route ' @entity132 said			2
' by marooning his own ship , @entity8 was free to report to the court of @entity159 @entity158 whatever lies he wanted without the court ’s overseers from the 1492 voyage contradicting him , exactly as he did			1
' the route of the first voyage - and the final resting place of the @entity5 during the first voyage of @entity8 in 1492 , near @entity170 , @entity8 ' flagship , the @entity5 ran aground , and the waves smashed it to pieces			1
leaving several men behind to establish a fort , @entity8 set sail for @entity135 in the @entity43			2
the discovery has been backed up by 2003 researcher that pinpointed the probable location of @entity8 's fort nearby			2
an expedition a decade ago led by @entity59 had photographed the wreck - but had no idea the boat was the @entity5			1
however , the team has already found items - including a cannon , have been looted , and is working with the @entity4 government ' to ensure the site is protected and preserved			1
' i am confident that a full excavation of the wreck will yield the first ever detailed marine archaeological evidence of @entity195 's discovery of @entity11 , said @entity59			1
' if excavations go well , it may ultimately be possible to lift any surviving remains of the vessel , fully conserve them and put them on display in a museum in @entity4			2
in 1492 , @entity204 and @entity158 , the rulers of the @entity135 kingdoms of @entity207 and @entity208 , agreed to outfit three ships for @entity8 , also promising to make him governor of any new lands he might acquire , along with 10 percent of all the wealth that he would bring to @entity135			2
with his fleet of three ships @entity8 sailed west on august 3 , 1492 with 90 crew , first stopping at the @entity217 to make repairs and take aboard fresh food			2
then the fleet headed out into the open @entity221 , dubbed the @entity222 on the 70th day ( many days after @entity8 had already expected to reach @entity225 ) , a lookout sighted land			2
it was early on the morning of october 12 , 1492			2
they landed on one of the islands of the @entity230 , which @entity8 named @entity232			0
the island natives came down to the shore to see @entity8 ' strange ships			0
thinking he had reached the @entity237 , @entity8 called these people @entity153			0
@entity8 had discovered what @entity239 would soon call the @entity241 of the @entity242			0
@entity5 ship model displayed in @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 the voyage sailed on to @entity248			1
he spent the next ten weeks exploring the islands of the @entity251 , landing on the island of @entity170 , shared today by the @entity253 and @entity4			0
he also landed on @entity254 , which he thought was the @entity248 mainland			0
both islands were heavily populated			0
near @entity170 , @entity8 ' flagship , the @entity5 , ran aground			1
the waves smashed it to pieces			0
leaving several men behind to establish a fort , @entity8 set sail for @entity135 in the @entity43			0
on the voyage home , he wrote a report of his discoveries			1
he offered ' as much gold as they need … and as many slaves as they ask ' if @entity204 and @entity158 would finance another voyage			0
as proof of what he could do , he brought them back a small amount of gold , parrots , and plants - as well as some @entity153 he had kidnapped and enslaved			0
previous researcher has found the daring seafarers who went on @entity8 ’ second trip to the @entity241 in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey			1
not only were they stepping into the unknown to find a home , but a new study suggests they may have also suffered from scurvy while sailing across the @entity221			0
the scurvy killed many of the early colonisers , researchers claim , causing the ultimate demise of the @entity294 settlement within just four years of it being founded			2
this is according to historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at @entity8 ' settlement in what is now the @entity253			0
researchers believe the colonisers beat most of the scurvy by the time they died , but the disease may have contributed to a wave of deaths in the early colony			0
@entity294 , the first permanent @entity239 town in the @entity9 , was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation			0
bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village 's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s			0
@entity294 was established in what is now the @entity319 , @entity253			0
it was one of the first @entity239 settlements in @entity11			1
it was founded by @entity8 during his second voyage in 1493 and named after queen @entity158			0
historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at @entity8 ' settlement in what is now the @entity253 suggests the early colonisers suffered from severe scurvy hunger and disease is thought to have soon led to mutiny , punishment , disillusion , and more hunger and disease			0
a group of settlers , led by @entity339 , attempted to capture and make off with several ships and go back to @entity135			0
@entity294 's demise took place in 1496 when @entity8 decided to abandon it in favour of a new settlement , which is now known as @entity346			0
‘ they were still encased in earth when we started the study			0
we had to clean the bones to proceed , ’ study author @entity347 told @entity348			0
historians have blamed smallpox , influenza , and malaria for the town 's failure , but the latest study by @entity362 's @entity361 argues scurvy was the main cause			2
at least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs — ridges carved in the outer lining of bones — of what the study describes as ' severe scurvy			0
' @entity373 , caused by one to three months of vitamin c deficiency , plagued seafarers until the 18th century			0
symptoms included lethargy , anaemia , and , the re-opening of old wounds			0
researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they 'd sailed directly from @entity135 to @entity294 - a journey of two months or less			0
when @entity8 and his companions reached the @entity242 , they landed at a @entity170 outpost first			0
‘ it was especially long , this trip - three months			0
and that 's exactly the time scurvy needs to be in full bloom , ’ professor @entity347 said .			0

@entity11 explorer @entity59 had announced in may that he believed that he may have found the @entity5
rival historians claim ship was run aground and used as accommodation
new @entity1 report proves wreck uses *technology* too modern for it to be the @entity5
