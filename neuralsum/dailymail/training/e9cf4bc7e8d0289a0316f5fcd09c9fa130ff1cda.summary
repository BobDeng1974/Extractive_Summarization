now the @entity12 phd student 's university debts look set to become a distant memory - with orders for the 25 - year - old 's miniscule gadgets pouring in from as far afield as @entity17			1
mr @entity2 said he has sold 290 of his £ 65 cameras - which measure just over 4cm long and 2cm high - since he began taking pre-orders last month , all but wiping out seven years ' worth of student debt in just four weeks			1
his @entity25 camera - which mr @entity2 has billed as the world 's first digital fish - eye lens - has become a hit thanks to its ability to produce expensive - looking photographs despite having just 12 megapixels , one button and no lcd screen			1
' i 've always been a fan of photography from a young age , but only ever used film cameras , ' said mr @entity2			1
' a friend bought me an slr camera a few years ago , and i wanted to get a fish - eye lens for it			2
' however , as they cost hundreds of pounds and me being a student i had virtually given up on the idea			0
' but then i thought instead to make my own one using old camera parts			0
' the @entity45 student , who hails from @entity46 in south @entity12 , was inspired by lomography - the growing analogue camera movement - in developing his own tiny creation , which has no viewfinder or screen to view photos			2
it can shoot high - quality images and hd video , and has a built - in lithium battery which can be charged via a usb port			0
miniscule : the student 's tiny camera measures just over 4cm long and 2cm high , but still produces expensive - looking photographs ' one of the things i first loved about it is that it does n't have an lcd screen to preview images - so you have that element of surprise when you come to look at the photos you have taken for the first time , ' mr @entity2 said			1
' that 's something i love about using film cameras , but being a hard - up student i could n't always afford to develop rolls			1
' so that 's where the idea about making it digital came in			0
' when friends saw the results of his labour - and the photographs the camera produced - mr @entity2 found himself bombarded with requests			2
he launched his camera via the fundraising website @entity89 in february , limiting production to a run of 500			0
' @entity92 ' : a photograph of a chimpanzee taken with the @entity96 fish - eye camera mr @entity2 , who obtained undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in @entity98 and @entity99 before deciding to study for a doctorate , added : ' since taking pre-orders a month ago , 290 people have put their money down for the @entity104			1
' that amounts to almost £ 19,000 worth of pre-orders in a little over a month			2
' i 've even taken one order of a batch of 50 from @entity17 - which is amazing considering the camera has only been promoted via word of mouth			0
' i 've also had a lot of interest from airplane enthusiasts and extreme sports fans , who are looking for a cost effective way of capturing their adventures			0
' i 'm hoping the camera will be just the start of things , ' the fledgeling entrepreneur said			0
' but for now , my main focus is getting more orders processed , begin manufacturing and ultimately it 's then about getting the product out there			0

all but wiped out seven years ' worth of student debt in just four weeks
£ 65 camera is small enough to fit in the palm of its user 's hand
