if it was up to @entity2 , we 'd all be strutting around in flesh - coloured body stockings next season			1
as ridiculous as it may sound , that may well be the case as the musician - come - designer has received an abundance of praise for his range for @entity13 from fashion editors , authorities , and influencers			2
the collection made its way down the runway on the first day of @entity20 yesterday , comprising of full body stockings , see - through skin - coloured crop tops and visible nude pants			1
it 's certainly a new take on underwear as outerwear - one certainly not for the faint hearted			2
writer @entity29 , 24 , from @entity30 , trialled the full flesh - coloured body stocking look , stepping out on a @entity30 @entity31 to find out what the reaction from onlookers would be			1
she paired an @entity54 ( £ 12.50 ) , crop top ( £ 10 ) , leggings ( £ 14 ) and - of course - a £ 6 pair of pants , from @entity60 , worn over the top , all in a beige flesh tone , topping off the look with a @entity65 style parka jacket from @entity66			1
speaking about her outfit , and whether she thought it worked , @entity29 said : ' the problem is visible pants			0
it 's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now , and it 's a bit of a laugh , but i would n't dare go out like this seriously			0
' a nude crop top and leggings , though , could work			0
you 'd have to tone this down a notch to take it from catwalk to @entity31			2
' i 'm quite surprised that people on the street generally liked my outfit to be honest - some fashion know - it - alls praised how bold it was , noting the @entity2 influence , and said that the jacket and lipstick went well with the all - nude look			1
' some though , of course , said that the pants were too much			0
' @entity29 paired an @entity54 bralet , crop top , leggings and pair of @entity60 pants worn over the top , all in a beige flesh tone , with a parka @entity29 's look was inspired by @entity106 x @entity104 collection seen in @entity107 on thursday			2
the designer 's wife @entity65 , 34 , turned up wearing an ensemble from the range			1
she liked the look so much , she even posted an @entity113 photo of herself , adding : ' my look for the @entity116 ! ! ! ! ! ! yeezy head to toe ! ! ! ! ! ' critics similarly seemed to enjoy @entity2 's latest fashion offerings with @entity120 saying : ' @entity2 's @entity20 collection with @entity13 lives up to the hype			1
' he had the fashion bible 's editor - in - chief , @entity126 , and top designer @entity127 sitting front row			0
@entity2 's wife @entity65 showed up to the event wearing a brown body stocking with a grey crop top and a camo jacket everyone from builders to couples and fashionistas to old ladies seemed to like the bold look , much to @entity29 's surprise everyone from builders to couples and fashionistas to old ladies seemed to like the bold look , much to @entity29 's surprise the problem for @entity29 was visible pants			1
' it 's quite funny to walk around dressed like this now , but i would n't dare go out like this seriously ' a review posted on the fashion magazine 's website said : ' @entity151 were raw and frayed , tops billowy , bottoms either skintight to slide into newly unveiled suede stiletto boots or cinched and ready to be tucked into aforementioned boosts			0
' there were immaculate flak vests and officer sweaters that looked like they ’ve actually taken shrapnel , and everything was said to be unisex ... on display , in rigid lines of expressionless youth , it was at the very least satisfyingly instigative for a line of sportswear			0
' refinery 29 noted that @entity2 's collection probably would sell well saying : ' it was a lineup of oversized jackets , sweatshirts , sweaters , and leggings , interspersed with @entity175 nude - colored underwear			1
' a camo parka that @entity65 also wore was a highlight , and we thought the oversized backpack was a clever accessory that 'll probably make it into a healthy stack of editorials			0
' @entity2 claims that he wanted the collection to be made up of ' solutions based clothing , ' saying , ' i do n't want the clothes to be the life , i want the clothes to help the life			0
' it is also thought that it will have a relatively low price point compared to other designer clothes meaning the pieces can be snapped up by his fans			0
now that the fully nude spray - on look has won approval from fashion darlings and the man on the street , will you be trying it out ? @entity29 says maybe a nude crop top and leggings could work - without the pants			2
you 'd have to tone this down a notch the show is the first time @entity2 has received praise for his attempts at fashion design @entity2 's collection featured baggy coats which sat over the body - stocking models stood in an army - like formation wearing their outfits designed by the rapper			1

@entity2 *launched* his debut collection of nude body suits and crop tops for @entity13 at @entity20
wife @entity65 arrived wearing the daring designs and critics have praised the collection of sports - wear
@entity48 takes the style from catwalk to @entity31 to see if a real woman can pull off underwear as outerwear look
sent writer @entity29 to test the trend and *captured* the public 's reaction on camera ( it may surprise you ! )
