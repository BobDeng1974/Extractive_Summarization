dubbed gallery on the @entity17 by the volunteers who run it , the converted @entity15 phone box is free to view and open to visitors every day			1
picture perfect : postcards for sale inside the phonebox gallery , a community project set up by volunteers in @entity27 open sesame : a woman uses a giant pair of scissors to open the phonebox gallery labour of love : volunteers help to revive the disused phone box with a coat of paint the telephone box was bought as part of a scheme called @entity42 in 2009 and since then has put on 10 exhibitions in the tiny space inside			1
@entity45 , 72 , gallery on the @entity17 's curator , said : ' we bought the box off the local council for £ 1 and all the town helped to refurbish and paint it			1

' supporter : @entity59 is set to showcase his obsession with @entity62 ' stereographic ' photography - the @entity61 of its age - in the phone box gallery in november @entity66 legend @entity59 has even confirmed that he will be showing an exhibition in the tiny gallery in november , showcasing his interest in @entity62 ' stereographic ' photography			1
