@entity1 has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab , it has been claimed			1
speculation was rife last week when an @entity1 - owned car was spotted driving around @entity7 fitted with @entity9 - style cameras			1
' dozens of @entity1 employees , led by experienced managers from its @entity15 unit , are researching automotive products at a confidential @entity18 location outside the company 's @entity20 campus , ' the @entity10 claims it was told by sources close to @entity1			1
' the email was sent to @entity34			0
it followed sightings of an @entity1 - owned car fitted with cameras ( pictured ) in @entity7 claims that @entity1 is building a car may seem like a leap , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the @entity7 firm			1
in an interview last year , @entity1 board member @entity46 said that before his death in 2011 @entity48 had considered building a car			2
he told @entity51 : ' @entity48 was gon na design an @entity52			0
' i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' it says the @entity1 research lab was set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away			1
it is believed @entity1 designer sir @entity61 is overseeing the lab , and the @entity64 owning designer is known to be a car enthusiast			1
the @entity10 says one of its sources initially believe the project was @entity1 's in - car entertainment system , known as @entity70 - but now believes it is something more			1
' three months ago i would have said it was @entity70			0
today i think it 's a car			0
' the @entity74 says that hundreds of employees are working on the project , codenamed @entity77			1
it says ceo @entity79 approved the project close to a year ago with product design vice president @entity81 leading the group			0
his @entity85 page reveals he was previously an engineer at @entity86			0
' i love helping to create new product spaces and delivering challenging new technologies , ' his biography says			0
' at @entity1 i have been lucky enough to help build and lead the teams for the first @entity91 , first @entity15 , all subsequent iphones and @entity91 as well as hundreds of @entity1 branded accessory products			1
' @entity94 ' was given permission to create a 1,000 - person team and poach employees from different parts of the company			2
' ' the project , code - named ' @entity77 , ' has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan , ' its sources claim			1
@entity1 also recently hired former @entity107 r&d head @entity106 , who joined @entity1 as a @entity109 systems engineering leader last fall			2
a source claiming to be an @entity1 employee has hinted that the giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give @entity30 a run for its money			1
' the email from the unnamed employee was sent to @entity34			0
it described ' vehicle development ' at the company but did n't reveal further information			0
in particular , @entity1 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity30 's range or a self - driving car that would ultimately also rival @entity129 's autonomous project			1
the cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop self - driving software , for example			2
the firm is also trying to poach staff from @entity30			1
@entity1 is trying very hard to hire engineers away from @entity30 , @entity138 told @entity140			1
the ceo claims that the @entity20 company is gunning hard for his employees , offering them as much as $ 250k signing bonuses and 60 % salary increases			2
in particular , @entity1 may be working on an electric car to rival @entity30 's range ( the @entity148 is pictured ) or the email could be referring to an advanced @entity15 in - car control system that would rival @entity30 's software ' @entity1 tries very hard to recruit from @entity30 , ' he said			1
' but so far they 've actually recruited very few people			0
' this may seem like a leap for @entity1 to take , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the @entity7 firm			1
in an interview last year , @entity1 board member @entity46 said that before his death in 2011 @entity48 had considered building a car			2
alternatively , the vehicle spotted in @entity7 could be a self - driving car			1
the cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software , for example			0
if @entity1 was developing such systems , they would would rival @entity129 's self - driving cars ( pictured ) the head of self - driving cars for @entity129 expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years			1
@entity180 said the cars would still be test vehicles , and @entity129 would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians			0
but mr @entity180 would n't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse , saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly			0
he told reporters last month at the @entity191 in @entity192 that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars			0
he told @entity51 : ' @entity48 was gon na design an @entity52			0
i think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design			0
' alternatively , the @entity1 employee 's email could be referring to an advanced @entity15 in - car control system that would rival @entity30 's software			1
the @entity206 van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog @entity209 in @entity211			1
the blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing , but he refused to give an answer			0
but a video from last year shows a similar car , which later transpired to be an unmarked self - driving @entity206 caravan			0
according to 9to5mac , the @entity220 ( @entity221 ) confirmed the vehicle was leased to @entity1			1
with 12 cameras on top of the car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity129 's @entity9			2
' too many cameras , ' said technology analyst @entity230			0
' it has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle			2
' this would further lend itself to the self - driving car theory			0
' unfortunately for that theory , only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles , and @entity1 is n't one of them , ' said 9to5mac			0
with 12 cameras on top of the mysterious @entity1 car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like @entity129 's @entity9 ( pictured left )			1
@entity129 launched its @entity9 technology in 2007 , and has refined the technology ever since ( @entity9 screenshot near @entity251 in @entity252 pictured right ) ' this brings us back to a much more likely conclusion : @entity1 is preparing to take on @entity129 's @entity9 with a similar offering in its own @entity258 software			2
' they said it might feature as part of the @entity262 9 upgrade due later this year , although it would likely begin only with select cities such as @entity264 and @entity211			2
this would plug a noticeable hole in @entity267 , which has been missing @entity9 - style images ever since @entity1 made it the default maps app for @entity15			2
when contacted by @entity270 , @entity1 declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was .			0

claims lab is already up and running outside of the firm 's @entity277
@entity280 hinted that @entity1 is developing a vehicle as part of a project codenamed @entity77 that ' will change the landscape '
