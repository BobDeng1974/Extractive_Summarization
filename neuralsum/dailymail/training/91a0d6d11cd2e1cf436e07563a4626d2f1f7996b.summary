in fact , he accumulated more than £ 900 in fines by stealing from seafront traders in @entity3			2
so understandably , local business owners were outraged when the serial thief , 32 , was let off paying almost £ 860 of it – on the condition that he spent the day on court premises			1

@entity24 , chairman of @entity25 ’ @entity23 , said : ‘ that is not a deterrent			0
it is carte blanche for him to carry on offending			1
