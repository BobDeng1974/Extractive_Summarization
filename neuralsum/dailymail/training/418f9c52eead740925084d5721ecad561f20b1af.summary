by @entity0 last updated at 5:34 pm on 12th september 2011 a @entity2 driver is suing the state for wrongly issuing thousands of tickets to people who flashed their lights to warn other motorists of speed traps			2
@entity9 says the act is not illegal and has filed a lawsuit on behalf of every driver fined for the violation over the past six years , accusing police of misinterpreting state law and violating motorists ’ free speech rights			1
' i do n't like what the government is doing , especially now when most people have a hard time affording gas , ' the 38 - year - old told @entity25			0
' and now they have to defend themselves against a made up charge that does n't exist			0
' class action : @entity9 is suing the state of @entity2 on behalf of 2,500 drivers wrongly issued with tickets for flashing their lights mr @entity9 , of @entity34 , was driving the @entity35 in @entity36 two years ago when he noticed two black @entity38 cruisers in the median , with their lights off			1
he did what he always does and flashed his lights to oncoming motorists to warn them of the impending speed trap			0
the officers did not take kindly though , and within 60 seconds they had pulled him over and were in the process of issuing him a ticket for $ 115 for improper flashing of high beams mr @entity9 says the @entity38 trooper told him what he had done was illegal			1
' you could tell in his voice he was upset , ' mr @entity9 told @entity55			1
' he was professional , he was n't rude , but you could tell he was irritated			0
' mr @entity9 later learned that flashing lights is not an offence , though , and had his ticket dismissed by @entity61 judge @entity60			1
ticket : mr @entity9 says motorists are being unlawfully punished by frustrated police officers who feel they were disrespected angered for others affected , mr @entity9 hired attorney @entity66 of @entity67 , and filed a class action suit which says ' @entity2 @entity69 ' – under which mr @entity9 was cited – ' does not prohibit the flashing of headlights as a means of communications , nor does it in any way reference flashing headlights or the use of high beams			1
' mr @entity9 says police are misinterpreting a law which is meant to ban drivers from having strobe lights in their cars or official - looking blue police lights			1
the lawsuit states the @entity38 is fully aware they are wrongfully applying the state law and they are doing it as a means of generating revenue			0
in 2005 , a court order was even issued saying the state law does not prohibit the flashing of vehicle headlights			1
mr @entity9 's lawsuit , filed in circuit court in @entity94 , cites similar cases in @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 counties in which tickets for flashing were all dismissed by judges			1
specifically , he discovered online the story of @entity106 , 22 , of suburban @entity107 , who received a a ticket in 2005 before winning a similar case in court			0
see the light : the suit says police are misinterpreting a law that 's meant to ban drivers from having strobe lights in their cars or official - looking blue police lights litigation : some estimates put the cost to the state if it loses as high as $ 150million , because the suit is seeking $ 15,000 in damages for each driver ' in each of these examples , ' the lawsuit claims , ' @entity2 courts properly found that ( the law ) does not prohibit the flashing of headlights as a means of communication , ' which the suit calls ' a right of free speech			1
' ' this is a pattern , and it has mostly to do with frustrated police officers who feel they were disrespected , ' mr @entity9 told the @entity141			2
' when someone comes along and rats them out , they take offense to it			0
' captain @entity148 , a spokesman for the @entity38 , cited to the @entity141 a law that says ' flashing lights are prohibited on vehicles ' except for turn signals			2
but soon after mr @entity9 launched his case against the state , the @entity38 ordered all troopers to stop issuing tickets to motorists who use headlights as a signal to other drivers			2
' you are directed to suspend enforcement action for this type of driver behavior , ' said the august 29 memo from @entity166 , acting deputy director of patrol operations			0
the lawsuit estimates that 2,400 motorists in @entity2 were cited for headlight - flashing between 2005 and 2010			0
it asks a circuit judge to certify the case as a class action on behalf of those other motorists , which means that if the state loses , it could be forced to return a substantial amount of money			0
some estimates put the cost as high as $ 150million , because the suit is seeking a refund of the $ 115 ticket plus $ 15,000 in damages for each driver			0
the state has not formally answered the lawsuit yet			0
' for me , this has to do more with the principle than the cost , ' mr @entity9 said , adding that the state is not being honest when it says it does not write tickets to increase revenue , but rather to get people to slow down			1
if that were true , mr @entity9 told @entity55 , the @entity38 should be delighted with him , because drivers did decelerate before troopers could give them a ticket .			2

@entity9 says there is no law to prohibit light flashing
wants 2,500 people to be refunded and given damages
