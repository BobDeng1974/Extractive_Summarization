compensation culture : the claims were revealed under freedom of information laws a policeman who hurt his tooth after using a riot shield upside - down , another who was singed during firearms training and a third who opened a window only for it to fall on him also feature in a catalogue of claims brought by officers against their own police force			1

he twisted his knee despite warnings that the floor was slippery , and is now pursuing his force for a payout			0
the @entity49 today claimed the cases will ' make people 's blood boil ' and infuriate other officers who do not make such claims			2
the officer with the hurt tooth , who is left - handed , sought damages after being given a right - handed shield , which he said led to injury as he had to use it ' the wrong way up '			0

a @entity14 statement said : ' @entity158 looks to make sure that any claims are dealt with fairly , professionally and in accordance with the @entity161 and protocols			2
' the nature of police work means it is unpredictable and officers and staff can , unfortunately , occasionally get injured during operations , daily duty or training exercises			0
' all the claims are assessed on the severity of the injuries , the circumstances in which they were received and the question of liability is always fully investigated objectively			0
' where liability exists , compensation is paid to minimise the impact of the injury and feedback is given to ensure that any lessons that can be learnt			0
' @entity184 , chief executive of the @entity49 , said : ' these claims will make people 's blood boil , and wind up officers on the front line who do n't make such ludicrous claims			0
' the police do a difficult job and those hurt in the line of duty deserve support , but clearly some of these cases and the amounts involved are spurious to the extreme			0
' its time police chiefs stamped out the compensation culture that has crept into parts of the police station			1
