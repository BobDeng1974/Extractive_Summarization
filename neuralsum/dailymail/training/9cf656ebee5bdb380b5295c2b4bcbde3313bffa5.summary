by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 2 march 2013 after the phenomenal success of @entity4 ’s @entity2 , it was perhaps inevitable that a property equivalent of the culinary show would follow			2
and , sure enough , @entity17 ’s may the @entity16 was born , a programme in which four homeowners rate each other ’s houses for their interior design , comfort and hospitality to win a £ 1,000 prize			2
the new series of the show is due to be broadcast in the spring , and of the houses to feature , few can match @entity22 ’s property in @entity23 , @entity24 , for originality			1
seeing the light : @entity22 outside @entity27 , a former @entity28 which he has converted into a three - bedroom home @entity27 is a former baptist church			1
while that might not seem unusual in itself – as congregation numbers fall across the country , scores of places of @entity33 worship have been converted – this one is strikingly modern			2
moreover , the change of use came about as a result not of decline but of a rising congregation			0
a chapel was first built on the site in 1815 and the existing building dates from the @entity47			0
by the early @entity50 , as more and more people joined the congregation , the church decided to vacate the building and move somewhere bigger			2
the site was sold to the @entity52			0
@entity22 , 59 , a publisher of magazines for schools , bought the property in 2010			1
‘ my original idea was to use it for a call centre for my business , ’ he says			0
‘ but then i decided it would make a nice house			0
’ he spent £ 80,000 on the renovation , and the project took a year to complete			1
@entity22 turned what was a simple hall at the front of the building into a contemporary living space with three bedrooms , two studies ( both of which could be converted into further single bedrooms ) , and an eye - catching black - and - green kitchen and dining area			1
praise : pictured is the bright living room area with the front doors in the centre and the iron stairs up to the mezzanine level the concrete floor was ripped up to install an underfloor heating system , which is now covered by gleaming porcelain - style flooring tiles			1
sections of open brickwork on the walls were also plastered over			0
but the most extensive work was the addition of a mezzanine floor covering the back of the hallway for the master bedroom with en suite wet room accessed by a stylish cast iron spiral staircase			2
@entity22 was uncertain how to deal with the vast total - immersion font , typical of @entity99 chapels , that stood in the centre of the hall			1
‘ we considered turning it into a @entity104 , ’ he says			0
‘ but in the end , we just filled it in			0
’ generally , however , he found the original design of the chapel fitted in with his vision for a modern living space			1
‘ what is unusual for a church is that this building was designed to be flooded with light , ’ he says			0
though divorcé @entity22 has transformed the front of the building – which he is now selling for £ 425,000 – what may excite prospective buyers is that the area at the back has scope for further development			1
chapel change : @entity124 cost mr @entity22 £ 80,000 which he is now selling for £ 425,000 the 36ft by 12ft space has a further bedroom , kitchen and bathroom			1
‘ it is such a big space that it has great potential to be used for a business such as a nursery , ’ he says			0
‘ alternatively , it could become a separate annexe or perhaps be used as a granny flat			0
’ although @entity22 did not install the underfloor heating in this part of the building , he says it could be easily extended from the system in place for as little as £ 1,500			1
with rail services to @entity146 ’s @entity145 taking around 50 minutes from nearby @entity148 station , the property would easily suit young professionals planning to commute to the capital			0
@entity151 , of selling agents @entity153 , is suitably impressed by @entity22 ’s renovation work and says : ‘ there is nothing quite like it available anywhere in this area or anywhere in @entity161			2
’ @entity162 , 01480 421 898			0
to discover how @entity27 is received by @entity22 ’s fellow competitors in @entity164 , tune into the show when it is broadcast in the spring .			1
