by @entity0 three former @entity2 players have been diagnosed with having signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , including former @entity6 great and football @entity7 @entity8 , 59			1
up until recently , the only way to diagnose @entity5 was by studying brain tissue after death , but a @entity13 research team has pioneered a brain - imaging technique that identifies a build - up of abnormal proteins called tau in the brain			1
the other players diagnosed were @entity21 offensive lineman @entity20 , 62 , and former all - pro defensive lineman @entity22 , 52			1
one other unidentified player was also tested but his results are not yet known			0
recently diagnosed : @entity8 has undergone three months of testing that confirmed the presence in his brain of a kind of protein linked to a degenerative disorder legendary player : @entity8 pictured in 1988 , the last of his 12 years of playing professional @entity2 the presence of tau in the amygdala and subcortical regions of the brain is believed to be triggered by trauma from repeated blows to the head			1
these regions control learning , memory , behavior , emotions , and other mental and physical functions			0
the players underwent three months of testing			0
five other players were tested last year ; all were confirmed to have signs of @entity5			1
former athlete : since @entity8 ( center , in number 33 jersey ) ended his professional playing career he has experienced a range of symptoms from depression to memory loss the condition is found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma such as boxers , and is increasingly being associated with @entity2 players			1
a build - up of tau protein in the brain strangles brain cells and causes the brain to degenerate , resulting in memory loss , confusion , impaired judgement , impulse control problems , aggression , depression and progressive dementia			1
@entity8 played 12 years in the @entity2 , 11 of those for the @entity6 and recorded 12,739 rushing yards and 77 touchdowns			1
he told @entity80 's @entity81 that he has suffered memory loss , getting lost while driving his young daughters places he 's been going every week for years			1
he experiences mood swings , lashing out at his family uncharacteristically			2
' it 's painful , man , for my daughters to say they 're scared of me			0
' after a long pause , he tearfully reiterated , ' it 's painful			0
' @entity8 has also been diagnosed with depression and had suicidal thoughts			2
as of december last year , 33 @entity2 players have been diagnosed with @entity5 postmortem , among them at least four of them died by suicide			1
' my quality of living has changed drastically and it deteriorates every day , ' said @entity8			2
' i 've thought about crazy stuff , sort of like , " why do i need to continue going through this ? " ' he said			0
' i 'm too smart of a person , i like to think , to take my life , but it 's crossed my mind			0
' brain trauma : @entity22 ( left ) and @entity20 have both been diagnosed with signs of @entity5 @entity20 , 62 , told @entity81 that he 's sure his condition was caused by his football career			1
' i can guarantee you my @entity5 , my tau , came from hits , came from blows to the head , ' he said			2
he suffers anxiety , insomnia , mood swings and has had suicidal thoughts			2
during his 13 - year career playing for @entity119 and @entity120 , he was never diagnosed with a concussion but estimates he had at least 100 concussions out of thousands of blows to the head during games and practice			0
the @entity2 has repeatedly denied there is enough evidence to conclude there is a link between football and @entity5 , but in light of recent diagnoses has shifted its position on head injuries , introducing rule changes and promoting education			2
' i knew something was going on			0
it takes me back to the fact that we [ as players ] were treated [ after head injuries ] and still put back out there in harm â€™s way , when from my understanding management knew what they were doing to us			0
abnormal protein : this slide from @entity13 shows the build - up of tau protein ( in red ) in two former @entity2 players ' brains ' they were still subjecting us to that kind of physical abuse without the proper treatment			1
it really hurts ... but i 'm determined to beat this , ' @entity8 told the @entity163			0
in january , dr. @entity164 , a @entity165 neurosurgeon and co-chair of the @entity2 's @entity167 , told @entity81 that the @entity5 study was ' promising work , ' adding the researchers were ' honest about the limitations as well as being excited about the findings			2
' @entity8 , @entity22 and @entity20 are among the more than 4,500 plaintiffs in a class - action lawsuit filed against the @entity2 , which argued that for years the @entity2 had concealed a link between football and brain damage			1
in august , they settled for $ 765 million but as part of the settlement , the @entity2 did not admit to any wrongdoing			0
neurosurgeon @entity183 , part of the @entity13 research team told @entity80 , ' until we had the ability to see it in a living , breathing person , we had no chance of helping them , we had no chance of really understanding what happens to the disease			1
it gives us the ability to track it , to see if it gets worse , or hopefully , maybe it gets better with medication , with intervention , with new discoveries			0
' @entity8 is hopeful about the future now that he has received a diagnosis for his troubling symptoms ' i 'm trying to slow this down or cut it off , ' he said			0
' i 'm going to be 60 years old here next year , so i 'm hoping that i 've got another good 30 years or so			0

former @entity6 great @entity8 has been diagnosed with having signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity5 )
he was diagnosed by a research team from @entity13 which developed the test
before the test , the only way to discern @entity5 was to examine the brain after death
former @entity2 players @entity22 and @entity20 were also confirmed to have signs of the disease
@entity5 causes memory loss , confusion , mood swings , depression and eventually dementia
