it 's clear that people are still intent on parting hard			0
but in a video posted to social media , one man looks as though he was having a little too much fun			2
sitting in the stands at one of the many stages spread around @entity16 , the reveler is dressed in a rainbow coloured singlet , denim shorts and slip - on shoes			0
one man at @entity21 in @entity5 at the weekend was so inebriated he tried to take photos with his credit card thinking it was his phone lost in his own world , the partygoer throws his arms around while still seated , thrashing his head in an attempt to keep up to the beat of the music			1
as the music pumps around him he stands up and moves to the fence in front of him to look down on the stage and dancers below			2
then , deciding this would be an appropriate moment to try and capture a photograph , the confused festival goer pulls his wallet out his pocket			2
while sitting down the partygoer pulls out his wallet , before reaching for his credit card still dancing , he holds his wallet out in front of him , he fumbles and looks to be trying to swipe his wallet as if it 's an @entity43			1
the man then pulls out a credit card , thinking it is a camera , and clutches it like a phone			1
he seems to try and take photographs while holding out the card , staring at it as if it has a screen			0
standing looking down on the crowd below , the man attempts to take photos with his credit card then , realising that he has been unsuccessful in capturing a ' photo ' - or maybe thinking he had captured some great shots - the man puts his card back into his wallet			1
the clip has had hundreds of thousands of views on @entity63 , and has been shared thousands of times by people who ca n't believe what they 're seeing			0
many social media users have expressed how hilarious they find the footage , while others have expressed their concern for the man , who is clearly very inebriated			0
holding the item up in front of his face he stares at it as though it has a screen			0
