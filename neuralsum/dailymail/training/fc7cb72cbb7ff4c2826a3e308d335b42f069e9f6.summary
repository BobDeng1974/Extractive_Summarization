a formerly obese man has transformed his life after being inspired to get fit by boxer @entity2			1
@entity3 , 38 , a computer programmer from @entity4 , @entity5 , has lost 10st in just 10 months			1
at his heaviest , @entity3 weighed over 25st and struggled to do basic things like walk up the stairs			1
changed his ways : @entity3 dropped from 25st 2lb ( left ) to 15st ( right ) by totally revamping his diet and embarking on a fitness regime he feared for his health as his father had died from an obesity - related illness			1
@entity3 explained : ' when i was 14 years old , my father sadly passed away from a heart condition which was related to his weight			1
' i could see myself slowly heading in the same direction and i knew something needed to be done			0
' @entity3 found inspiration for his weight loss from an unusual place			1
' i started following @entity2 on @entity24 , who would often post inspirational tweets about his training in preparation for a fight coming up , ' he said			1
' he was overweight at the time and trying to lose weight			2
he kept posting funny things like images from the film @entity34 and it made me giggle			2
i started thinking i could do that , i can lose weight			2
' due to his size , @entity3 was too embarrassed to go to the gym so he purchased a press trainer and a monkey gym which he kept in his garage at home			1
inspiration : @entity2 gave @entity3 the push he needed to get in shape after he followed him on @entity24 fat to fit : @entity3 has gone from struggling to climb the stairs to an exercise fanatic in under a year ' i just locked myself away for 10 months really			1
i gave up drinking and all my unhealthy snacks			0
' i used to be a champion at lying still			0
i work from home and i used to get my shops delivered and sometimes would barely leave the house for weeks			0
' everyday stuff was hard			0
even just climbing the stairs i would get sweaty and out of breath			2
' i was n't happy with the way i looked but i would n't really admit that to anyone			0
' @entity3 decided to drastically change his diet , ditching the highly processed foods he was living off , such as pies , cereal , sandwiches and frozen chips , in favour of more wholesome foods			1
he now eats a high protein diet with lots of chicken , rice , sweet potatoes and fresh vegetables			2
as the weight dropped off @entity3 gained enough confidence to join his local gym and began to gradually increase his exercise			1
then and now : @entity3 says he is the fittest he has ever been , right @entity3 now works out most days , only taking a day off when he feels the need to			1
an average day will see him working out at least twice , doing a variety of different exercises such as swimming in the morning , a weights session at lunch and exercise classes at the gym in the evening			1
he explains : ' i try and mix up my exercise			2
i 've fallen in love with running outdoors so i do a lot of that			0
i 'm fitter than i 've ever been before in my life			0
' after losing over 10st , he signed up for the urban obstacle assault course , @entity93 , run by company @entity94 , to help keep him motivated and to give him a target to work towards			2
@entity3 said : ' the @entity99 course was gruelling but great fun and i am very proud to say that i completed it in 1 hour and 23 minutes - so all my hard work and training certainly paid off			1
breakfast : cereal or eggs and bacon , with lots of toast lunch : a pie or sandwich or trip to chip shop dinner : frozen meals such as chicken and chips snacks : sweets and several packs of crisps a day			2
lots of fizzy drinks breakfast : a protein shake with flax and chia seeds or porridge with a banana lunch : chicken , mashed sweet potato and vegetables dinner : an omelette made with chicken and salad snacks : fresh fruit ' having an event like this to work towards provided me with the motivation i needed to keep training and it in turn helped me to maintain my weight loss			0
' i 'm much happier with my body now			0
i do n't think i 'll ever be totally happy with myself though , even though a few people say i should be now			0
' i spend so long being ridiculously self conscious and i just got used to people looking down on my because i was so over weight			0
' i still have work to do on my body but i do realise it will take time and there is no quick fix			0
' i really hope that by telling my story i can now inspire others who are in a similar situation to what i was to lead a healthier lifestyle as it is the best thing i ever did '			0
the next @entity93 is set to take place in @entity165 on the 22nd november which will see @entity167 transformed into a colossal 10km urban assault course .			0
