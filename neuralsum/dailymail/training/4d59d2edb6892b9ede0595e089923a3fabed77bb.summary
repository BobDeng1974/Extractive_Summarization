by @entity0 published : 11:26 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 11:44 est , 26 april 2013 climbing through an upstairs window carelessly left open by a @entity5 homeowner , a group of thieves ca n't believe their luck as they race around the house ransacking cupboards			1
but far from your average burglar , this gang of crooks are n't human - they 're baboons on the hunt for food			2
an astonishing video of the animals wrecking a @entity5 home has been posted on @entity18			1
the group watched through a downstairs window and witnessed the baboons ransacking cupboards and running amok looking for food			1
after a few moments , @entity46 and his friends fetch a ladder and go into the house to chase off the creatures before they cause anymore damage			0
they are seen chasing the animals around the house with a broom and yelling at the baboons to leave			0
most of them run away terrified as soon as they spot the group , but one final stubborn baboon remains in an upstairs bathroom trying to open a cabinet			0
the cameraman yells ' get out of here , here 's the door ' , while brandishing the broom , but soon bids a hasty retreat when the angry animal barks at him			0
hungry : the cameraman says that he thinks the primates are feasting on some chicken found in the kitchen smash and grab : one of the cheeky raiders is pictured climbing inside one of the kitchen cupboards eventually , the final primate is chased away and seen escaping over the garden wall			0
the footage was shot in the small tourist town of @entity81 on the @entity83 cape of @entity5			1
baboon break ins are becoming increasingly common across @entity5 and have been attributed to the animals losing their natural habitat through erosion or urban sprawl			1
the creatures are often forced to break into cars or homes in a bid to try and steal food			0
some parts of @entity5 have even been forced to hire ' @entity95 ' to chase the animals away from urban areas			1
baboons that are known to persistently steal from humans have been put down in the past despite the species being protected in the country			2
visitors are strongly discouraged from feeding the animals , because baboons associate humans , homes and cars with food , but it does not prevent tourists indulging them			2
getaway : the animals jumped out of the building the same way they got in when confronted by the neighbours angry : one last stubborn baboon is spotted in the bathroom but the cameraman makes a hasty retreat when it barks at him			0

the footage was filmed in @entity81 on the *western* cape of @entity5
baboons ransacking homes is an increasing *problem* in the country
