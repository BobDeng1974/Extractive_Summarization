by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 10:49 est , 26 march 2013 as the centrepiece of the @entity4 river pageant last year , it was last seen decked in gilded finery and bearing a proud monarch			2
now the @entity7 , which served as the @entity9 ’s royal barge , is sailing under a foreign flag - having been sold to a @entity12 holiday company as a luxury charter cruiseboat			1
the 64 - metre vessel will start its new life as a pleasure cruiser on the @entity17 in @entity18 next month			1
stripped of its banners , thrones and @entity24 ensign , its prosaic exterior is barely recognisable from the sumptuous vessel that led a 1,000 boat flotilla down the @entity27 last june			1
luxury cruiseboat : @entity29 of @entity30 , flagship of the @entity9 's jubilee river pageant last summer , is now operating as a cruise liner out of @entity18 thrones : a pair of red velvet chairs , bought from @entity37 , are one of the new additions inside the barge , which sit beneath a reproduction portrait of @entity9 @entity42 : stripped of its banners , thrones and @entity24 ensign , the exterior looks very different from the vessel that starred in the @entity4 last year modifications : the new owner has replaced the original gilded prow with a pair of nubile mermaids modelled on his wife in place of the original gilded prow – which featured tasteful dolphins and the royal cipher - the new owner has mounted a pair of nubile mermaids modelled on his wife , topped with a fake crown			1
in june ’s pageant , the boat was garlanded out with flowers gathered from the @entity9 ’s gardens			1
now it has to make do with plastic imitation blooms strung along its upper railings			1
however , the @entity7 remains virtually untouched on the inside since it was given a six - month , £ 1million royal makeover in preparation for the jubilee celebrations			1
holidaymakers who stump up the £ 2,121 cost of a seven night cruise can recline on solid mahogany furniture , listen to a baby grand piano and sample drinks at the cocktail bar			2
the boat will take them up the @entity17 , stopping at vineyards and villages , until it reaches @entity81 in neighbouring @entity82			1
some of the interior fittings are surprisingly modern for a vessel designed to recreate the splendour of 17th century royal barges			1
@entity87 : the barge as it was decorated for the pageant last year , including flowers gathered from the @entity9 's gardens grand : for £ 2,121 , holidaymakers can enjoy a seven night cruise where they can listen to a baby grand piano and sample drinks at the cocktail bar replica : a fake crown fixed to the bow of the barge features : the barge features a crest on the outside ( left ) along with a crown and coat of arms fixed to the bow ( right ) alterations : the 64 - foot vessel will start its new life as a pleasure cruiser on the @entity17 in @entity18 next month the capacious main salon is fitted with neon light fittings designed to change colour from icy blue to warm pink at the flick of a switch			1
dinner guests are seated on banks of red leather sofas and upright @entity124 chairs while the walls feature glowing glass panels – designed by @entity128 designer @entity127 – depicting sensuous nudes			2
one of the few new additions – a pair of red velvet ‘ thrones ’ bought from @entity37 – sit beneath a reproduction portrait of @entity9			2
the spirit of @entity30 ’s 15 en - suite cabins fit 30 guests			2
they include all the comforts expected of a four star hotel – including 32inch flat screen televisions and ensuite bathrooms – but hardly rival the opulence of @entity143			0
starring role : the boat played a major part in the @entity147 last year attraction : the boat 's new owner expected the spirit of @entity30 's royal credentials to be a magnet for @entity24 tourists the main salon is fitted with neon light fittings ( left ) while a @entity12 flag now adorns the deck , along with imitation flowers ( right ) leisure : holidaymakers on the barge will also be able to enjoy drinks from the cocktail bar the boat was bought in september from its @entity24 owner , @entity166 , by @entity12 millionaire @entity167 , the ceo of charter company @entity168			1
the tycoon , who boasts he is a friend of @entity170 , said he acquired the boat for a ‘ bargain ’ , but said a clause in the sale contract prevented him from disclosing the price			2
mr @entity166 had spent £ 8million renovating the boat , but was reluctantly forced to sell it after the @entity178 prevented him from using it from cruise trips on the @entity27 over concerns it was too large to fit under a bridge in @entity184 , @entity185			2
mr @entity167 naturally expected the spirit of @entity30 ’s impeccable royal credentials to be a magnet for @entity24 tourists , and hired 14 @entity190 - speaking crew members to cater for their every whim			1
comfortable : the barge 's 15 en - suite cabins fit 30 guests and all include the comforts expected of a four star hotel bookings : owner mr @entity167 has been surprised to find most of the bookings so far have come from @entity200			1
pictured left is a cabin in the boat and right is the dining room refit : a view of a plaque noting the name @entity210			2
@entity211 , refitter of the spirit of @entity30 but he revealed most of the bookings to date have come from @entity200 , saying : ‘ it is kind of weird			0
i was totally convinced the @entity24 would be the first ones to buy trips on it			0
‘ but the @entity200 have booked out the majority of the year			0
they must be very curious			0
i hope it will be as popular with @entity24 people in the future			0
’ he added : ‘ it is a fantastic vessel			0
it is completely sound as it was fully checked out by the @entity226 before the jubilee			0
‘ @entity229 , it has some special security features			0
for example , there is a high - tech fire extinction system that uses high - pressure vapourised water to put out fires without causing damage			0
‘ it has amazing medical kits , with everything you could possibly need			0
i ’m not sure if the windows are bullet proof			0
i never asked , and i do n’t really want to test them			0
’ new gilded prow the original structure featured a sculpture of @entity27 , a pair of classical dolphins - symbols of the @entity27 - and the royal cipher			1
in its place , mr @entity167 has placed a pair of topless mermaids - which he says are based on his wife @entity256 - topped by an imitation crown			1
plastic flowers for june ’s @entity27 pageant , the @entity7 was garlanded with flowers from the @entity9 ’s gardens			2
its new owner has made do with strings of imitation flowers			1
although they may be less impressive , they will stand up to the heat of a @entity12 summer			1
@entity12 ensign when it served as the royal barge , the spirit of @entity30 was given a special permit to wear the @entity24 @entity273 , usually reserved for @entity226 ships , as well as the @entity275			1
its new owner said he wanted to keep a @entity24 ensign as it ‘ looks more authentic ’			0
but he was prevented by red tape imposed @entity24 @entity279			0
he said : ‘ they drove me totally insane			0
i wanted to keep the @entity24 ensign , but they said they had to come and certify not only my ship , but also the captain			0
velvet ‘ thrones ’ mr @entity167 imported the red velvet chairs from @entity37 store in @entity289			1
they were created as part of limited edition range of @entity293 by designer @entity294 , also known as the creator of the world ’s most expensive perfume			0
at first glance , the chairs seem authentically regal			0
but closer investigation reveals the heraldic crest and motto embroidered on the seat backs - ‘ fax animi honestae gloria ’ , meaning ‘ through honour , glory is found ’ - belong to mr @entity294 ’s family and not to the royals .			0
