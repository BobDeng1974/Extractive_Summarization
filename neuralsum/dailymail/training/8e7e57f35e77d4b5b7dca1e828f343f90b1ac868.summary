@entity1 @entity0 has signed a law barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay teenagers straight			1
the @entity6 governor said the health risks of trying to change a child 's sexual orientation trumped concerns over the government setting limits on parental choice			1
his decision yesterday was the latest example of the potential 2016 presidential candidate steering a moderate course			1
moderate : @entity6 @entity0 governor @entity0 , pictured in @entity18 last week , has signed speaks to fellow @entity1 , a bill banning therapists from trying to convert gay and lesbians to being straight should licensed therapists be banned from trying to turn gay teens straight ? should licensed therapists be banned from trying to turn gay teens straight ? now share your opinion he stated in his signing note : ' @entity29 should tread carefully into this area			1
. and i do so here reluctantly '			1
the decision marked the third time this month that @entity0 has staked out a moderate position on a hot - button social issue as he seeks a second term in a @entity40 - leaning state			1
it also offers more evidence that the popular governor is positioning himself as a pragmatist who shuns more conservative elements within his party			1
@entity0 found middle ground on medical marijuana for children when he agreed friday to allow growers to cultivate additional strains , and for marijuana to be made in an edible form for chronically ill children			1
but he would not lift an oversight provision that could require as many as three doctors to sign off on a prescription			0
last week , @entity0 vetoed a bill banning .50 - caliber rifles that was vigorously opposed by firearms rights advocates and gutted a proposed overhaul of the state 's gun permit law that relied on undeveloped technology			0
recently , he signed 10 less - significant gun measures the @entity68 - led @entity67 passed after last year 's deadly school shooting rampage in @entity70 , @entity71			2
standing out : the decision marked the third time this month that @entity0 , pictured , has staked out a moderate position on a hot - button social issue as he seeks a second term in a @entity40 - leaning state the decisions allow @entity0 to quiet some of the criticism he could face from conservatives by offering specific reasons why he was taking the steps , often citing compassion for the needs of children and families			1
his approval of the conversion therapy ban could be met with criticism in @entity94 conservative circles with influence in early voting states like @entity97 and @entity98			0
conversion therapy gained attention two years ago when former @entity1 presidential candidate @entity101 was questioned over whether her husband 's christian counseling business provided services that attempted to change gays and lesbians			1
@entity101 's husband , @entity107 , denied involvement in the therapy and the congresswoman dropped out of the presidential campaign in january 2012 after a poor showing in the @entity97 caucuses			2
in signing the ban , @entity0 reiterated his belief that people are born gay and homosexuality is not a sin , a position he first stated in a 2011 interview with @entity123 's @entity122			0
that view is inconsistent with his catholic faith , which teaches that homosexual acts are sins			0
@entity0 said on ' issues of medical treatment for children we must look to experts in the field to determine the relative risks and rewards , ' citing a litany of potential ill effects of trying to change sexual orientation , including depression , drug abuse and suicide			2
' i believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate , ' he said			1
the @entity6 governor , who has denied his actions recently have had anything to do with plans to run for presidency in 2016 , has for the third time this month made a decision along the lines of a more moderate position on a hot - button social issue @entity0 , however , has not moderated his position on gay marriage , which he vetoed and continues to oppose			1
as a result , gay rights activists applauded monday 's bill signing but pushed for more			0
' it is our truest hope that the governor will realize , as the majority of the legislature and a super-majority of the public have realized , that the best way to ensure lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender youth are protected from the abuse of being ostracized is to provide them with equality , ' @entity165 , executive director of the state 's largest gay rights group , @entity166 , said in a statement			2
@entity0 has said he supports the state 's civil union law , which was enacted to give gay couples the benefits of marriage but not the title			0
several couples have since sued , claiming the law provides them unequal treatment			0
a court decision is expected next month			2
gay rights groups say conversion therapy damages young people , because it tells them that it 's not acceptable to be whoever they are			0
some social conservatives framed the debate as a parental rights issue , saying a ban on the counseling would limit the ability of parents to do what they think is best for their children			2
conversion therapy has increasingly drawn criticism for its methods			0
last year , four gay men sued a @entity213 group for fraud , saying its program included making them strip naked and attack effigies of their mothers with baseball bats			0
@entity219 has also banned it .			0

@entity6 governor said health risks outweighed limiting parental choice
advised government to ' tread carefully ' and said he signed ' reluctantly '
third recent ' moderate ' decision by the governor , inc. *medicinal* marijuana
some say his moderate stance is to set himself up as presidential candidate
