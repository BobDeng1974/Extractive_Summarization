by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 10:32 est , 4 june 2013 a @entity2 - run council has been accused of ‘ petty politics ’ after launching a last - minute bid to block a private school ’s pioneering plan to become an academy			1
@entity8 , which charges £ 10,000 a year , wants to merge with a nearby state primary when it changes its status at the end of this term			0
but the historic move is in doubt after @entity15 decided to seek a judicial review , nine months after it learned of the scheme			1
it claims a statutory consultation process was not conducted properly			0
row : @entity20 in @entity21 wanted to merge with other local schools but the @entity2 - run council has opposed it @entity23 , the chairman of the trust that would run the new school , yesterday branded the legal challenge a ‘ cynical move designed to cause the maximum anxiety ’			1
he added : ‘ to put petty politics ahead of peoples ’ wishes and children ’s future education is thoroughly reprehensible			0
‘ at a time when the local authority is seeking to justify cuts in services , it is surprising that they regard the inevitable expense of seeking a judicial review in these circumstances as a proper use of council tax			2
’ @entity45 councillors complained the move was ‘ ideologically ’ driven to deny ordinary people access to an elite school			2
group leader @entity49 said : ‘ the @entity2 is ideologically opposed to independent schools - although hypocritically , both locally and nationally , a number of @entity2 politicians do choose to send their own children to them ’			1
other fee - paying schools have previously applied to become academies			1
many have seen pupil numbers fall as a result of the recession			0
but @entity8 , in the seaside village of @entity21 , is understood to be the first to include a local state primary in the process			1
the mixed school for four to 19 - year - olds , which was founded in 1860 and whose former pupils include @entity66 and @entity67 and @entity69 rugby player @entity68 , has lost around a third of its pupils in recent years			1
@entity8 takes pupils from four to 18 years old and its motto is @entity74 - ‘ behave properly ’			2
old boys : film star @entity66 and @entity76 ace @entity68 both attended the @entity20 which wants to become part of an academy senior figures at @entity80 , a registered charity which runs a group of @entity83 schools including @entity8 , decided to apply to become an academy			1
this allows it to continue to be run independently while being backed by taxpayers ’ money instead of fees			2
the plans included merging with nearby @entity91 , which was rated outstanding in its last @entity93 inspection			0
the new school , called @entity95 , would continue to run on both sites but would be operated by the @entity97			1
a total of 1,425 places would be available with maximum class sizes of 25			0
details were announced in september last year and the school is already heavily oversubscribed			0
but the plans are in jeopardy after @entity15 , which has had to make savings of £ 40 million over the past four years , claimed the consultation had not included ‘ appropriate ’ people with an interest			1
parents with children already in the schools were consulted and 90 per cent were in favour of the change			0
but the council says parents with children at other schools in the area should have been asked for their opinions			0
elected @entity2 mayor @entity117 said : ‘ the council has a responsibility to ensure that all children and young people in @entity121 can access the highest quality education			2
‘ the impact of the proposed @entity95 on the wider schools system in @entity121 has not been properly considered			0
’ mr @entity23 insisted the legal threat would not derail the merger and said it would be up and running by the start of the autumn term .			0

@entity20 in @entity21 wants to be an academy with local schools
film star @entity66 and @entity67 rugby ace @entity68 attended the private school
