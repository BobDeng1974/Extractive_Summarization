by @entity0 published : 10:46 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 10:48 est , 9 july 2012 arrests : expert @entity2 , pictured , has said that police are acting earlier to ' clear the decks ' of potential terrorists before @entity6 police are trying to arrest as many suspected terrorists as possible to ' clear the decks ' before the @entity10 , one of @entity13 's top qcs said today			1
@entity2 , the @entity13 's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , says the security services are ' defending further up the field ' to avoid any 7/7 or 9/11 - style attacks when @entity18 hosts the @entity19 later this month			1
' what one may be seeing as the @entity10 approach is a willingness to try and clear the decks in some respects , ' mr @entity2 told @entity25 's @entity27 programme			1
' we 're a long way from zero risk , we probably always will be , but the police are getting to hear about things long before they used to and i think that gives them choices which perhaps they did n't have before			1
' do they let things run , just keeping an eye on it , picking up evidence with a view to a criminal prosecution ? or do they move in earlier to disrupt it ? ' the @entity10 are potentially a major target and you are seeing the police , perhaps in a marginal case what they might do is decide to intervene a little bit earlier			1
' some 14 suspected terrorists were arrested last week , but he added : ' we should n't lose sight of the big picture , which is that things were a good deal worse six or seven years ago than they are now			1
' meanwhile detectives have been granted more time to question a 22 - year - old woman over a suspected terror plot in the @entity13			1
officers from @entity65 's counter terrorism command now have until friday to hold and grill the woman , who was arrested in @entity67 , east @entity18 , on saturday			1
danger : @entity69 and @entity70 are vigilantly trying to stop terrorists targeting the @entity72 and other venues five men arrested last week in connection with the same plot , including @entity13 muslim convert @entity79 , can also be held until thursday after @entity81 magistrates granted a series of warrants of further detention , police said			2
a seventh person held in the raids , a 30 - year - old woman , was released without charge on saturday			2
@entity88 , 29 , who changed his name to @entity91 after converting , was one of the six people arrested over the suspected terror plot last thursday			2
allegations : @entity95 convert @entity79 , now @entity96 , is one of six arrested last week over an alleged terror plot he is believed to have been one of three people detained in @entity101 , west @entity18 , and was arrested in the street			2
he appeared in a @entity104 documentary , my brother @entity107 , made by his stepbrother @entity108 last year , which described how @entity88 , originally from @entity109 , @entity110 , had been converted by controversial cleric @entity111			0
in the documentary he spoke of his support for jihad and sharia law			0
the others detained in @entity101 were a 21 - year - old man and a 30 - year - old woman held at separate home addresses			0
the woman has since been released without charge			0
three men living just over a mile from the @entity10 site in @entity123 , east @entity18 , were also arrested			0
the men , aged 18 , 24 and 26 , who are believed to be members of the same @entity127 family , were detained in a raid on their home			0
the six , who include a former police community support officer , remain in custody at a south - east @entity18 police station on suspicion of the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism			0
the alleged plan involved @entity143 extremists with potential targets in the @entity13 , but was not linked to the @entity10 , it is understood			0
the threat to the @entity13 from international terrorism is currently rated substantial - the third highest of five levels .			0

@entity2 says security services are intervening before @entity6 to avoid another 7/7 or 9/11
