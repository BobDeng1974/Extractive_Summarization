@entity0 is to leave the @entity1 and his role of managing director of @entity4 , @entity7 football 's governing body announced on tuesday			1
the highly - respected @entity0 , who deals most closely with the @entity4 team within the @entity1 hierarchy , has negotiated his exit after 17 years at the @entity1 where he also combined the job of director of communications			1
@entity0 leaves the @entity1 with a considerable vacuum at the top of the organisation , with general secretary @entity16 also going at the end of next month			1
@entity1 director of communications and managing director of @entity4 @entity0 is to step down @entity0 ( second left ) and @entity16 ( left ) are both leaving the @entity1			1
they are pictured with @entity1 chairman @entity20 ( centre ) , @entity4 boss @entity22 and sir @entity23 ( right ) in 2012 the communications director , who announced his ambitions of becoming a club chief executive in a sports business magazine profile before the @entity28 , has long seen 2014 as his likely last year at @entity29			1
and the @entity1 management reforms being carried out by chairman @entity31 have clarified that decision			0
the @entity4 set up , formed in 2010 to oversee the @entity4 operation at all levels and led for the last four years by @entity0 , has been heavily diluted by the arrival of technical director @entity36 and his blueprint for training @entity4 teams			1
@entity0 will leave his role with the @entity1 after 17 years with @entity7 football 's governing body and it is @entity36 who now effectively controls the @entity7 set - up at all levels from his @entity46 base along with his team of coaches and sports scientists			1
however , @entity0 will long be remembered at the @entity1 for his consummate skills as an outstanding communications chief			2
and the way he handled numerous high - profile @entity1 scandals and controversies over the years , ensures he will always be in high demand as a damage limitation specialist - inside and outside sport			0
losing @entity16 and @entity0 in such quick succession will now put a lot of pressure on @entity61 to find the right replacements			2
the @entity1 's director of elite development @entity36 's role has diluted @entity0 's responsibilities @entity0 , quoted on the @entity1 's website , said : ' it has been a privilege to work for @entity1 , but after almost two decades i want a new challenge			1
' i have been considering my departure for some time and discussed this with chairman @entity61 recently			0
i am grateful to @entity31 and @entity74 for their support over the years and in agreeing to my departure at the end of the month			0
' the @entity1 has provided me with tremendous experience and i look forward to drawing on this in the future			0
@entity0 ( right ) watches on as @entity22 and @entity82 talk during @entity4 training ' while it is a disappointment to leave without @entity4 winning a major trophy , i am convinced the foundations for success are now in place			0
' a huge part of my working life has been spent at the @entity1 and i have worked with so many wonderful people in the industry , both domestically and internationally			0
i would like to thank everybody who has helped me over the years			0
' @entity1 chairman , @entity61 , added : ' i 'd like to thank @entity0 for his contribution and loyalty over almost 17 years at the @entity1			2
' his experience and knowledge have been invaluable at so many levels , but he has made clear he is at a time in his life where he is ready to move on			0
' i know that everybody who has worked with him over the past 17 years will miss him , and on behalf of @entity1 i would like to wish him every success in the future			2
