@entity5 , 49 , was trying to clean a large knitting machine on august 19 , 2011 in @entity7 , @entity8 when it started accidentally			1
the company agreed to pay $ 1million following mr @entity5 's death , including $ 150,000 to his daughter			1
@entity0 agreed to pay $ 1m after worker @entity5 was mangled by a knitting machine in 2011 according to @entity8 deputy district attorney @entity19 : ' at the time of the incident @entity0 utilised specific knitting machines , which must be disconnected from the main power supply before maintenance , as they may inadvertently start and the operator may be drawn into the machine			1
' the machines are also required by law to be locked to prevent persons from entering and tagged to indicate that maintenance is being performed , also known as lock - out / tag - out procedures			0
workers must be sufficiently trained to employ necessary precautions to avoid serious injury			0
' on august 19 , 2011 , a knitting machine in an @entity0 facility in @entity7 was undergoing maintenance , and was turned off but still connected to a power source			1
the machine was not tagged out , as required , and individuals were not properly trained to de-energise the machines			0
' as a result , when employee @entity5 entered the machine cage , the machine re-started and @entity5 was subsequently mangled and killed by the machine			2
' @entity40 said @entity4 labour law was designed that employees had a healthy and safe place to work			2
she added : ' @entity0 failed to properly train its employees regarding safety procedures and failed to maintain a safe and healthy work environment			1
' the company released a statement following the agreement denying it had broken any laws concerning mr @entity5 's death			0
the company founder @entity53 , pictured , was sacked by the board ' for cause ' after an unrelated incident a spokesperson said : ' in august 2011 , an @entity0 knitting machine operator died in a tragic industrial accident			1
while the company does not believe it violated any laws regarding worker safety , it has entered into an agreement with the @entity8 district attorney â€™s office to resolve civil citations issued by @entity67 in a manner believed to be fair and that avoids the expense of protracted litigation			2
' @entity0 has been and continues to be absolutely committed to providing its employees with a safe work place and fair wages in a sweat - shop free environment			0
' the company agreed to pay $ 283,000 towards administrative and investigation costs as well as a further $ 566,000 in civil penalties			2
@entity0 recently sacked its chairman @entity53 ' for cause ' following an investigation into misconduct			0
@entity85 of @entity0 said : ' we take no joy in this , but the @entity89 felt it was the right thing to do			0
' @entity53 created @entity0 , but the @entity91 has grown much larger than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are still ahead			0
