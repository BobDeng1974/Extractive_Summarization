@entity0 used a @entity2 giveaway program for law enforcement to stock his office with an assault rifle , a handgun and a @entity7 — even though the people in his custody are in no condition to put up a fight			1
@entity0 is the @entity14 , @entity13 , coroner			1
he says the @entity7 helps him navigate the rugged terrain of the @entity17 foothills , but he struggled to explain why he needs the surplus military weapons he acquired more than two years ago			1
' i just wanted to protect myself , ' he said			2
settled for handguns : unlike @entity13 coroner @entity0 , @entity21 of the @entity22 settled for just a lot of .45 semi-automatic handguns for his agency when he applied to the @entity2 's 1033 surplus program ' i just wanted to protect myself ' : @entity14 , @entity13 coroner @entity0 was given a humvee , handgun and assault rifle by the federal government ( file ) his office is n't the only government agency with limited policing powers and a questionable need for high - powered weaponry to take advantage of the program			1
while most of the surplus weapons go to municipal police departments and county sheriffs , an @entity40 review shows that a diverse array of other state and local agencies also have been scooping up guns and other tactical equipment no longer needed by the military			1
military - grade weapons have gone to government agencies that enforce gaming laws at @entity54 tribal casinos and weigh 18 - wheelers in @entity56 , to the @entity22 and the @entity58 @entity57 in @entity59 , @entity60			0
other military surplus items have been bestowed on an animal control department in @entity63 , @entity64 ; a harbormaster in @entity66 , @entity67 ; and the @entity69 's sergeant - at - arms			1
the @entity2 's @entity70 has been controversial ; the @entity71 ordered a review of it and similar programs in august after a deadly police shooting in @entity75 , @entity76 , led to clashes between protesters and officers decked out in combat gear			1
under the @entity70 , thousands of law - enforcement agencies have acquired hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and other military castoffs			1
among them were dozens of fire departments , district attorneys , prisons , parks departments and wildlife agencies that were eligible to join the program because they have officers or investigators with arrest powers			2
guns , armored vehicles and aircraft only account for a fraction of the equipment up for grabs			0
several agencies surveyed by the @entity40 said they never asked for any weapons and only enrolled in the program to get free office equipment and other common items that would n't be deployed on any battlefield			1
the agencies receiving firearms are difficult to pinpoint because the federal agency overseeing the program only releases county - level data on weapons transfers , citing security concerns			2
but some participating agencies — or state officials who coordinate the program — were willing to disclose their inventories			2
@entity0 was qualified to enroll in the @entity70 because @entity13 coroners have arrest powers			1
elected to his first term as coroner in 2010 , he obtained a .45 - caliber pistol and an m - 16 rifle in 2012 after getting a @entity7 the previous year			0
he said he is trying to arrange for a local police department to take the two weapons			0
state program officials said they could n't find @entity0 's written justification for requesting the weapons			1
an official from the federal office that oversees the program approved both transactions			1
' what does a coroner need a big gun for ? ' asked @entity136 , @entity137 , coroner @entity138 , who used the program to obtain body bags			0
' i have never carried a weapon in my 20 years on the job			0
' ' i ca n't stand @entity145 ' : like @entity0 , @entity21 armed his agency with the help of the @entity2 's @entity70			1
@entity21 said he participated in the program to get weapons other than the @entity145 his agency issues to protect @entity152 cattle from theft @entity154 , the harbormaster in @entity66 , @entity67 , said he has n't received any weapons but acquired a humvee for driving in marshy areas and a night - vision scope to spot boaters in the dark			2
the humvee was stripped of weapon holders and the scope is n't attached to a gun , he said			0
' we have looked at it as saving this town big money , ' he said			0
' we 're not out there in tanks			0
we 're not dressing in battle uniform - type stuff			0
' the @entity174 agency obtained five 12 - gauge shotguns for its agents , who help regulate tobacco retailers and wholesalers			0
' a lot of the convenience store owners who are involved in ( tobacco ) smuggling are also on the terrorist watch list , have connections to organized crime , etc. , ' said @entity186 , an agency attorney			0
@entity186 said his agency 's law - enforcement officers have arrested at least one person whose name was on @entity192 's terrorist watch list , but he declined to provide details , saying the information was classified			0
the @entity22 's law - enforcement unit issues @entity197 - made handguns to its officers , who investigate cattle thefts and other industry - related crimes			2
but the board also obtained seven .45 - caliber handguns from the military surplus program roughly three years ago			1
' i guess primarily because i ca n't stand @entity145 , ' said senior investigator @entity21			0
similarly , @entity207 enforcement director @entity206 said its 10 surplus m - 16 rifles are ' just another tool ' for its law - enforcement agents , who also have agency - issued handguns			0
the @entity213 , which has an office that enforces laws governing commercial vehicles , obtained seven @entity218 rifles through the program			2
kayaking coroner : while so many firearms going to an agency that protects cattle may seem outrageous , @entity21 's requests are typical of the @entity70			2
another surplus program through the @entity226 gave coroner @entity0 's office a kayaklast year ' we do n't actually shoot them or anything			1
they 're basically used as props during our ceremonies , ' said department spokesman @entity235			0
the @entity70 is n't the only source of surplus property for law - enforcement agencies			2
they also can purchase equipment at discounted prices through the separate @entity241 , which is overseen by the @entity226			0
state and local government agencies of all stripes can acquire other types of non-military surplus property through a program overseen by the @entity248			2
@entity0 's office also obtained property through the @entity248 - run program but lost its privileges last year after state officials learned of concerns about some of its acquisitions , including a kayak , according to @entity259 , deputy director of the @entity260 of @entity261			1
' why would a coroner 's office need a kayak ? ' @entity259 asked			1
@entity266 ' department referred the matter last year to the @entity248 inspector general 's office , which is investigating			1
@entity0 , who is running for re-election and recently defeated a primary challenger who stars on a reality tv show about the @entity17 , denies any wrongdoing			0
' this has been a political thing from the word go , ' he said .			0

' i just wanted to protect myself ' : @entity0 from @entity14 , @entity13 made no *apologies* for his *suspicious* acquisition
the elected county official could participate in the @entity2 's @entity70 because he has arrest power
another military surplus program kicked @entity0 's office out when officials discovered it had also acquired a kayak , among other items
