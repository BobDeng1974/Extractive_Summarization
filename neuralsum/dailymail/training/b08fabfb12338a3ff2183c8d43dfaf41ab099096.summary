they are the bane of many office worker - colleagues who come in coughing and spluttering when they should really be in bed			0
now , a leading microbiologist has spoken out against the ' stiff upper lip brigade ' - instructing them to stay at home - even when illness is in the early stages			1
dr @entity10 , a leading microbiologist , has warned that coming into work even at the start of feeling ill can wreak havoc around the office			1
staff at @entity17 council have been sacked for taking too many sick days , as the average rose to 10 a year if you are even starting to feel symptoms , this is when you 're most likely to be contagious , he says			1
and other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more ill. ' we see a lot of worsening symptoms because people will just not stop and rest , ' said @entity29 , a health sciences assistant clinical professor at the @entity31			1
she told @entity32 : ' they want to go ; they want to be able to do everything they normally do			0
if you are healthy but others around you at work are sick , there are some measures you can take to protect yourself			1
dr @entity10 suggests frequent hand washing , for 15 to 20 seconds each time , and then drying them with a clean paper towel			1
this alone can reduce the spread of germs by nearly 80 per cent			2
if there is no water around , use instant hand sanitiser if available			0
disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces have also been shown to reduce viruses by up to 62 per cent			2
the @entity53 scientists found that using tissues to wipe the face , hand sanitiser and washing hands before lunch and after a big meeting resulted in an 80 per cent reduction across the board , for all three viruses , in their risk of infection			2
' what they do n't understand is that they 're pushing themselves to the point where they 're actually a lot sicker at the end of two to four days than they would have been if they had just taken that first day off and let their body fight the infection			0
' and while taking cold and flu remedies can help ease symptoms , they can affect work quality by causing drowsiness			2
' this is when you just get a fever and are starting to feel under the weather			0
and if you go to work in this state , any medication you take will interfere in how well you do your job , ' added @entity29			2
earlier this year , scientists at the @entity53 found it really is better to stay at home , such is the speed that germs spread around an office			1
they discovered when even one person comes to work sick , more than half of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected with the virus by lunchtime			1
when someone comes to work sick , about half of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected with the virus by lunchtime			1
some of the likeliest germ hotpots include telephones , desktops , tabletops , doorknobs , photocopier and lift buttons and the office fridge			0
however the study also revealed that simple interventions , such as hand washing and the use of hand sanitiser or wipes , can drastically reduce employees ' risk of infection			0
conducted in an office , the study included about 80 participants , some of whom received droplets on their hands at the start of a normal work day			0
while most of those droplets were plain water , one person unknowingly received a droplet containing artificial viruses mimicking the cold , the flu and a stomach bug			0
other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more ill - and it 's better to take a day off at the start of an illness employees were instructed to go about their day as usual			1
after about four hours , researchers sampled commonly touched surfaces in the office , as well as employees ' hands , and found that more than 50 per cent of surfaces and employees were infected with at least one of the viruses			1
' we were actually quite surprised by how effectively everything spread , ' said @entity150 , @entity53 associate professor of public health at the university			0
' i did n't expect to find it as much as i did			0
' and that was in an office environment where people work primarily in isolated spaces , she added			2
touching surfaces - rather than coughing and sneezing over people - is how most germs in an office are spread , say the researchers			1
these viruses can last anywhere from a few hours to up to a month			0
researchers swabbed surfaces and hands again at the end of the work day			2
by then , the cold and flu viruses , known for their short survival time , had dissipated , but the stomach virus had continued to spread , infecting up to 70 per cent of surfaces tested			1
' we really felt that the hand was quicker than the sneeze in the spread of disease , ' said @entity10 , co-principal investigator on the study			1
most people think it 's coughing and sneezing that spreads germs , but the number of objects you touch is incredible , especially in this push - button generation			2
we push more buttons than any other generation in history			0
the key message is to stay at home when you 're sick			1
' the same study then was repeated with a ' @entity198 ' in place			0
employees were provided free tissues , disinfecting wipes and a bottle of hand sanitizer and were instructed to wash their hands before eating lunch and after meeting with a large number of people			0
with those simple interventions in place , risk of infection dropped below 10 per cent .			0

dr @entity10 says we are most contagious in early stages of illness
ill people should always stay at home , such is speed germs spread
others warn coming to work in early stages *prolongs* and worsens illness
previous research found that when one person comes to work sick , more than half of the *communal* surfaces are infected with the virus by lunchtime
