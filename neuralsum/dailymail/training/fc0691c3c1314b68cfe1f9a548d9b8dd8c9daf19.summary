billions of years ago , a lake once filled the 96 - mile - wide crater being explored by @entity3 ’s @entity2 , bolstering evidence that the planet most like @entity6 in the solar system was suitable for microbial life			1
the new findings combine more than two years of data collected by the rover since its sky - crane landing inside @entity13 in august 2012			0
scientists discovered stacks of rocks containing water - deposited sediments inclined toward the crater ’s center , which now sports a three - mile ( 5 km ) mound called @entity22			1
the images , taken on @entity6 , have been altered for the illustration			0
a dry period is shown at left , during which rocks in the mountains weather away , creating sediment that is transported down the once - wet river system			0
the middle panel shows a wet period , where water is flowing			0
sediments are transported , building up the fan , delta , and lake floor			2
in the subsequent dry period shown at right , the water is gone			0
the exposed fan and lake floor are now at higher elevations due to the transport of sediment			0
@entity22 stands about 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) tall , its lower flanks exposing hundreds of rock layers			2
the rock layers – alternating between lake , river and wind deposits -- bear witness to the repeated filling and evaporation of a @entity24 lake much larger and longer - lasting than any previously examined close - up			1
curiosity currently is investigating the lowest sedimentary layers of @entity22 , a section of rock 500 feet ( 150 meters ) high dubbed the @entity67 formation			2
that would mean that @entity22 did n’t exist during a period of time roughly 3.5 billion years ago when the crater was filled with water , @entity2 researchers told reporters during a conference call			1
@entity24 was also once an entirely wet and warm planet , with giant , long lasting lakes forming across its surface , the latest data from @entity3 's curiosity rover has shown			1
this interpretation of @entity2 's finds in @entity13 suggests ancient @entity24 maintained a climate that could have produced long - lasting lakes at many locations on the @entity24			1
' if our hypothesis for @entity22 holds up , it challenges the notion that warm and wet conditions were transient , local , or only underground on @entity24 , ' said @entity92 , @entity2 deputy project scientist at @entity3 's @entity93 in @entity94			1
' a more radical explanation is that @entity24 ' ancient , thicker atmosphere raised temperatures above freezing globally , but so far we do n't know how the atmosphere did that			1
' researchers were baffled over why @entity22 sits in a crater			2
@entity22 stands about 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) tall , its lower flanks exposing hundreds of rock layers			2
the rock layers - alternating between lake , river and wind deposits - bear witness to the repeated filling and evaporation of a @entity24 lake much larger and longer - lasting than any previously examined close - up			1
' we are making headway in solving the mystery of @entity22 , ' said @entity115 scientist @entity114 of the @entity116 in @entity94 , @entity117			2
' where there 's now a mountain , there may have once been a series of lakes			0
' @entity13 on the planet @entity24 as it is today			1
@entity13 is 96 miles ( 154 kilometers ) in diameter , and at its centre @entity22 stands about 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) tall			2
mount @entity22 as it once was : observations by the rover indicate @entity24 ' @entity22 , where it is currently exploring , was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years			1
curiosity currently is investigating the lowest sedimentary layers of @entity22 , a section of rock 500 feet ( 150 meters ) high dubbed the @entity67 formation			0
rivers carried sand and silt to the lake , depositing the sediments at the mouth of the river to form deltas similar to those found at river mouths on @entity6			2
this cycle occurred over and over again			0
' the great thing about a lake that occurs repeatedly , over and over , is that each time it comes back it is another experiment to tell you how the environment works , ' @entity114 said			0
' as curiosity climbs higher on @entity22 , we will have a series of experiments to show patterns in how the atmosphere and the water and the sediments interact			1
' we may see how the chemistry changed in the lakes over time			0
this evenly layered rock photographed by the @entity162 ( @entity163 ) on @entity3 's @entity2 shows a pattern typical of a lake - floor sedimentary deposit not far from where flowing water entered a lake			1
@entity22 compared to mountains on @entity6 : the elevation of @entity22 is given in kilometers relative to the floor of @entity13			0
the heights of @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 are given in kilometers relative to @entity6 's sea level			0
after the crater filled to a height of at least a few hundred yards and the sediments hardened into rock , the accumulated layers of sediment were sculpted over time into a mountainous shape by wind erosion that carved away the material between the crater perimeter and what is now the edge of the mountain			0
' this is a hypothesis supported by what we have observed so far , providing a framework for testing in the coming year			0
' after the crater filled to a height of at least a few hundred yards and the sediments hardened into rock , the accumulated layers of sediment were sculpted over time into a mountainous shape by wind erosion that carved away the material between the crater perimeter and what is now the edge of the mountain			0
on the 5 - mile ( 8 - kilometer ) journey from @entity2 's 2012 landing site to its current work site at the base of @entity22 , the rover uncovered clues about the changing shape of the crater floor during the era of lakes			1
' the size of the lake in @entity13 and the length of time and series that water was showing up implies that there may have been sufficient time for life to get going and thrive , ' said @entity3 's @entity226 scientist @entity225			0
' we found sedimentary rocks suggestive of small , ancient deltas stacked on top of one another , ' said @entity2 science team member @entity232 of @entity233 in @entity234			1
' @entity2 crossed a boundary from an environment dominated by rivers to an environment dominated by lakes			2
' despite earlier evidence from several @entity24 missions that pointed to wet environments on ancient @entity24 , modeling of the ancient climate has yet to identify the conditions that could have produced long periods warm enough for stable water on the surface			1
this image shows an example of a thin - laminated , evenly stratified rock type that occurs in the ' @entity253 ' outcrop at the base of @entity22 on @entity24			1
the @entity163 on @entity3 's @entity2 acquired this view on oct. 28 , 2014			0
this type of rock can form under a lake			0
this image shows inclined beds characteristic of delta deposits where a stream entered a lake , but at a higher elevation and farther south than other delta deposits north of @entity22			1
this suggests multiple episodes of delta growth building southward			0
it is from @entity2 's @entity163			0
@entity3 's @entity270 uses @entity2 to assess ancient , potentially habitable environments and the significant changes the @entity24 environment has experienced over millions of years			1
this project is one element of @entity3 's ongoing @entity24 research and preparation for a human mission to the planet in the 2030s			2
' knowledge we 're gaining about @entity24 ' environmental evolution by deciphering how @entity22 formed will also help guide plans for future missions to seek signs of @entity24 life , ' said @entity225 , lead scientist for @entity3 's @entity226 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity290 .			1

@entity22 was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years , @entity2 has found
shows ancient @entity24 climate may have produced lakes at many locations
now *believed* the ancient , thick atmosphere on @entity24 raised temperatures above freezing globally on the planet
