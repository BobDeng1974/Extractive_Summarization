by @entity0 a businessman who three years ago was estimated to be worth nearly £ 40 million has been given a suspended jail sentence after a judge concluded that he had failed to obey a @entity5 order to pay maintenance to his ex-wife			1
@entity9 ’s ex-wife @entity8 had complained that he was in contempt of court and had asked a judge to commit him to prison			2

@entity21 , 51 , pictured left , has told the @entity23 in @entity16 that her ex-husband @entity24 , pictured right , has failed to pay her the £ 17.5m lump sum which she won in their high profile divorce battle @entity28 yesterday told @entity23 judge mr @entity13 that ms @entity21 did not want to send her husband to prison - but that she had no alternative in view of what he had done			1
mr @entity34 said mr @entity9 had falsely claimed he was ' impoverished ' in order to avoid paying the money			2
but he said the multi-millionaire had in fact been enjoying lavish holidays to the @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
he had also spent around £ 12,000 on vip tickets to a concert by pop star @entity45 for his children and their friends			1
the court also heard that mr @entity9 , who had just returned from @entity49 , was not in court because he was on a three - week holiday in @entity41 with the children			1
mr @entity34 said that , although mr @entity9 had paid the children ’s school fees and staff costs at ms @entity21 ’s @entity16 home , he had not handed money to his ex-wife as ordered			1
he said mr @entity9 's ' false claims of impoverishment ' and ' tale of woe ' were ' untrue ' and that there had been ' widespread and persistent ' attempts to mislead the court			2
in 2011 , at an earlier stage of the divorce battle , mr @entity13 ruled that mr @entity9 's net assets were worth £ 37.5m			1

mr @entity9 , who is said to be in his 50s , was not at the hearing but was represented by his lawyer , @entity85			0
ms @entity85 told the judge that a doctor had assessed mr @entity9 as being unable to attend the hearing , ' both emotionally and physically ' due to ill health			2
but the judge rejected his bid to adjourn the case for one year on the grounds of ill health , saying he was clearly not too ill to fly to @entity41			0
mr @entity13 , sitting at the @entity23 in @entity16 , today give his ruling and ms @entity85 said mr @entity9 had described his oil trading days as being ' over ' and that his accounts had been closed and staff made redundant			1

he added that he had ' engaged in the process ' , had not ' shirked responsibilities ' and had taken care of his children			0
the letter read said : ' i have not killed anyone , nor have i committed any crime			0
i have simply slipped on the accident of life			0
' i have taken care of my children and will always do so			0
any suggestion that i am running away is unfortunate			0
' the couple - who married in 1993 and divorced in 2011 - spent most of their married life in @entity16 but also had properties in @entity74 and the @entity40 , the court heard			1

i have simply slipped on the accident of life ' @entity9 ms @entity21 still lives in the £ 5m family home in @entity72 , west @entity16 , which she kept under the divorce settlement			1
three years ago , at the first stage of the couple 's divorce battle , mr @entity13 concluded that mr @entity9 had made ' various attempts ' to conceal the extent of assets			1
the judge then made a wealth assessment ' doing the best he could ' on the material available			0
properties which were held in the name of companies controlled by mr @entity9 were a central issue in the court case			0
mr @entity13 initially ordered mr @entity9 to transfer properties held in the names of companies he controlled to his ex-wife			1
but the @entity81 disagreed and said mr @entity9 did not have to hand property to ms @entity21			1
in june 2013 , the @entity19 overturned the decision and ruled in ms @entity21 ’s favour			0
that court ruled that houses owned by @entity148 and other @entity150 - registered companies controlled by her husband in @entity16 and the @entity153 can be sold to settle her award of £ 17.5m			0
the seven judges unanimously overturned an @entity157 ruling that companies owned by the oil trader were not family assets and could not be taken into account when calculating a divorce payout			0
the judge will give his ruling on the latest court hearing later today			0

@entity9 was ordered in 2011 to pay wife @entity8 the lump sum
he has since enjoyed lavish holidays to @entity40 and @entity49 , court heard
