by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 's decision to splash £ 11million on @entity4 has led to much head scratching and a few raised eyebrows			1
sure the @entity9 international was the leading scorer in the @entity11 last season with 28 goals , but considering @entity14 spent the same on @entity15 , it seems @entity3 have certainly paid over the odds for the 27 - year - old striker			1
here @entity18 looks at other attacking players @entity3 could have spent their money on			2
@entity35 ( @entity34 to @entity36 - £ 2m ) @entity38 sensation : @entity35 took the @entity39 by storm during his first season , scoring 18 goals relatively unknown outside of @entity38 before his move to @entity46 in 2012 , the midfielder - turned - striker hit the ground running with 18 league goals in his debut season to help @entity36 qualify for @entity28			1
his second season was less impressive as he only scored twice in 17 appearances			0
@entity52 ( @entity53 to @entity54 - £ 4m ) going red : @entity52 is fulfilling a childhood dream with his move from @entity53 to @entity54 the striker scored 13 goals for @entity53 last season and impressed with his general all - round play			1
he earned himself a call up to the @entity33 squad for the @entity64 and a move to boyhood club @entity54 earlier this summer			0
@entity66 ( @entity67 to @entity68 - £ 7m ) sharp shooter : @entity66 ( left ) scored 19 @entity39 goals during his first season in @entity33 blessed with pace and power , @entity66 proved an astute signing by @entity68 as he found the net 19 times in the @entity39 - breaking the club record for the most league goals in a season			1
his second season in @entity33 was cut short by an achilles injury that ruled him out for sixth months and the @entity64			0
@entity81 ( @entity82 to @entity83 - £ 8m ) high flyer : @entity81 has excelled for @entity83 since signing from @entity82 two seasons ago the prolific striker has scored more than 20 goals in all competitions in his last five seasons - and since moving to @entity90 has scored 52 times in just 96 games			2
his consistency led to a call up to the @entity96 squad in 2011 , and prior to moving to @entity83 he was linked with several @entity39 clubs			0
@entity100 ( @entity99 to @entity54 - £ 8.5m ) creative spark : @entity100 ( right ) celebrates scoring @entity54 against @entity102 last season the @entity105 midfielder may have been overlooked for @entity107 's @entity64 squad , but he has impressed at @entity108 with his eye for a pass and trickery			1
eight @entity39 goals in his first season was also a decent return for the 22 year old			2
@entity115 ( @entity116 to @entity117 - £ 7m ) spot on : @entity115 scores for @entity117 against @entity3 in the @entity119 @entity115 - or ' @entity120 ' - has earned a reputation as the ultimate supersub during his time in @entity33			2
with blistering pace and quick reactions , the striker has scored vital goals coming off the bench that have changed games			0
yet to be seen how much he would score playing regularly			0
@entity130 ( @entity131 to @entity53 - £ 6m ) national service : @entity130 was in contention to go to the @entity64 before injury ruled him out @entity130 scored 15 goals last season and was in contention to be part of @entity139 's @entity64 before being ruled out with a anterior cruciate ligament injury			1
@entity144 at playing off either flank or down the middle as a striker , @entity130 has become a key player for @entity53			0
@entity147 ( @entity146 to @entity148 - £ 11m ) @entity149 for you : @entity147 in action for @entity148 against @entity152 with more than 100 caps for @entity154 and a cv that includes three @entity156 , a @entity11 runners up medal and a @entity160 title , @entity147 is one of @entity28 's most experienced and accomplished players			1
critics would say he needs to score more goals but rarely plays as a central striker for @entity148			0
@entity165 ( @entity166 to @entity167 - £ 11m ) lethal : @entity165 celebrates scoring against @entity117 in @entity169 quarter final the @entity171 striker scored twice in a 4 - 0 win over @entity173 at the @entity64 but has fallen down the pecking order at @entity167 and has been linked with a move to the @entity39 , with @entity117 , @entity176 and @entity148 all interested			0
ps it 's not all doom and gloom for skeptical @entity3 fans because they can at least take comfort in the fact @entity4 was cheaper than @entity183 , who signed for @entity3 on deadline - day from @entity185 for £ 12.4m			1
three @entity186 ( £ 3m each ) 9,573 cruises around the world ( £ 1,149 ) 226 nights in world 's most expensive hotel suite ( £ 48,660 per night ) 68,750 pairs of adidas predator instinct boots ( £ 160 ) 1,326 return flights between @entity195 and @entity196 on @entity197			0

@entity3 's £ 11million @entity4 transfer has come under *scrutiny* with many feeling the player is *overpriced*
@entity4 was the leading scorer in the @entity11 last season with 28 goals
