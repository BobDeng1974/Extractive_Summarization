@entity1 's worst fears about @entity2 have been realised as the @entity3 forward faces up to eight weeks on the sidelines			1
@entity2 pulled up sharply during @entity1 ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity6 on saturday and left the field on a stretcher ; manager @entity9 immediately said after the game that the signs ' did not look good '			1
he was sent for scans on sunday and subsequently had more tests on tuesday to determine the full extent of the damage			0
it is understood that @entity2 is now not expected to return before december			2
@entity2 looked in some pain after picking up a hamstring injury at @entity19 on saturday the @entity1 forward had to be carried off on a stretcher during his side 's @entity22 clash against @entity6 a lay - off of that length would equate to him having suffered a grade two tear of his hamstring			1
it is a huge blow for @entity9 and @entity1 , as @entity2 has been in excellent form since the start of the season and had scored three goals in seven appearances			1
the 26 - year - old will now be denied the opportunity to play against his former club @entity37 in the @entity38 at the end of this month , as well missing up to six @entity41 fixtures , starting with this sunday ’s trip to @entity43			2
when @entity2 first joined @entity1 in 2012 , he suffered a number of hamstring problems but last season he turned things around and was virtually ever present before going on to help @entity3 reach the quarter - finals of the @entity48			1
news of @entity2 ' injury will come as a major blow to @entity9 's first team plans @entity9 has praised the work @entity2 has done to improve his fitness and the former @entity56 striker admitted recently that he was in his best physical condition , now that he had fully adjusted to the demands of @entity60 football			2
@entity2 said : ‘ when i came here from @entity62 at first i struggled because the leagues are totally different			0
here it is all about possession , about running up and down , it ’s non-stop all the time			0
i was getting very tired when i first arrived but now i feel totally different about things – i feel very good			0
‘ it ’s my third season here and each one it has got better			0
the players have improved , we ’ve improved as a team every year			0

the @entity3 ace is likely to be out of *action* until december
@entity2 had to be taken off after just *31* minutes against @entity6
@entity9 will be without his forward for @entity1 's trip to @entity79 on sunday
