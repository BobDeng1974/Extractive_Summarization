' @entity1 has two disintegrated discs in her neck that have been causing her extreme pain , ' confides the source			1
but behind the scenes they 're facing a more critical problem : @entity1 wo n't even let @entity11 talk to her about having the surgery she needs although doctors are telling her she risks doing permanent damage if she does n’t have the surgery , she feels she ca n’t put her family and her responsibilities on the back burner long enough to have the operation			1
' last month when @entity1 spent eight days in an @entity20 hospital , her people said it was because of migraine headaches			1
and while it ’s true she does suffer from debilitating headaches – it ’s because of the diseased discs in her neck			0
' the pain is so bad she has to take pain medication , ' says the source			0
' but the longer she takes it , the more meds she has to consume in order to ease the pain			0
it ’s a vicious circle			0
' the source adds that @entity1 feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now , and to take time off to have surgery , and recover - which could take weeks - means she wo n’t be able to attend to everything she currently has on her plate			1
' @entity1 feels a lot of pressure to bring money in right now , ' says the source			2
' she and @entity11 have been struggling and she knows how important it is for her to keep doing her @entity23 reality series , and the new @entity72 sit - com she and her old friend @entity70 are doing for @entity74 ’s @entity73			1
pressure : @entity1 is afraid that if she spends a week in the hospital , leaving @entity11 home alone with the four kids , he wo n't be able to handle it			1
he 's already showing signs of stress ' @entity1 believes ratings for her reality series would suffer if the story line is forced to center around her hospitalization and recovery , and she knows she has to keep working if the bills are going to get paid			1

' @entity1 and @entity11 have been working hard on trying to put their marriage back on track after he admitted to cheating , ' says the source			1

kid trouble : to add to @entity1 's woes , she and @entity11 learned that their six - year - old daughter @entity108 , who suffered a broken leg a few months back , must now undergo a tonsillectomy ' she also knows that having the operation means she will have to be in bed recovering for a few weeks , putting even more stress and strain on the family and she ’s just not willing to do that			1
' @entity11 wants her to take care of herself , but @entity1 told him not to even bring it up again right now			1
he is worried about her and feels her painful condition complicates their relationship			0
but she is so afraid if she drops the ball on all she has to do right now , they will have no chance			0
if what is going on the their reality show is any indication of @entity11 's mental state , he is falling apart			1
@entity1 does n't want to add any stress to their lives			1
by taking herself out of commission , say the source			0
while @entity1 does worry about her health , her priority is her kids and she and @entity11 just received word their six year old daughter @entity108 , who suffered a broken leg a few months back , must now undergo a tonsillectomy			1
“ @entity1 knows that @entity108 will be traumatized by having her tonsils out and she feels she has to be there for her little girl			1
and it ’s just like @entity1 to put her family ’s needs ahead of her own – because all her life , she ’s had to be the one who takes care of everyone one else			2
” according to another source , @entity1 basically grew up looking after herself and her younger brother @entity154			2
@entity1 and @entity154 – who is five years her junior – lived a lonely life in their 57,000 square			2
foot , $ 85 million mansion in @entity20 ’s posh @entity161			0
their father , producer @entity162 , was already in his 50 ’s when the kids were born , and their mother candy was always involved with charity work and her various hobbies			0
a house divided : @entity1 grew up looking after her younger brother @entity154 ( right )			2
their father , famed producer @entity162 was preoccupied and mother candy involved in charities and hobbies			0
the kids lived in a different wing of the house and had to fend for themselves , calling on a cook to bring them a meal or call their parents on the house phone if they wanted to ask them a question			0
@entity1 wants to be a a hands - on parent poor little rich girl : @entity1 grew up in this palatial 57,000 square foot home in @entity161 that @entity186 recently sold to @entity188 heiress @entity187 says a family source , ' the family of four lived in the largest house in @entity192 , boasting 123 rooms and i remember the kids saying it was like being orphaned living in the big house because while their parents lived in one wing , they were assigned another			2
' the kids said that although they were the envy of all their friends , living in a house with a pool , a tennis court , a home theater and a bowling alley , the house felt cold			0
they also felt so alone that they would often have to fend for themselves , calling on a cook to bring them a meal or having to call their parents on the house phone if they wanted to ask them a question			0
' @entity1 was like a protective little mother to @entity154 , ' says the source			2
' and she was always watching out for him			0
and to this day , she tends to put her own needs aside in order to care for her family , even if it means risking her health in order to make sure everyone else in the family is well looked after			0

today is @entity228 and @entity11 's eighth wedding *anniversary* , but there 's little cause for *celebration*
besides *agonizing* over her troubled marriage , @entity1 has learned that she has two disintegrated disks in her neck and needs to undergo major surgery
the reality star is so afraid that spending weeks in the hospital and then recuperating from the operation will put too much stress on @entity11 - and their relationship
and now the couple have learned that little @entity108 needs an operation too - she needs to have her tonsils taken out
