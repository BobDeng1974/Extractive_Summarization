you could soon unlock your phone simply by holding it up to the side of your face			1
researchers have created a sensor that can recognise the unique shape of your ear , your palm or any other body part you want to use to access your device			1
called @entity13 , the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner removing the need to specialist hardware such as fingerprint readers or infrared cameras			1
details of its algorithm are included in their paper , @entity13 : @entity36 on @entity37 using the @entity38 to @entity39			0
the @entity41 card is designed to end the tiresome task of manually unlocking a smartphone or tablet by automatically making it come to life whenever the user is nearby			0
the credit card - sized gadget also locks devices again as soon as a user moves out of range at a distance of ten feet ( three metres )			0
@entity41 connects to an app on a user ’s @entity56 handset or @entity58 via @entity59 and also tells them if they have strayed too far from their wallet , where the firm suggests the @entity41 card is stored			0
the card was created by @entity64 - based duo @entity63 and @entity65			0
. they claim it will save people around 53 hours over a year , based on the belief that the average phone user unlocks their phone 150 times a day			2
' recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords , making authentication more convenient for users , ' explained the researchers			2
' however , due to their cost , capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top - of - the - line phones , a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor			2
' they continued that while the input resolution of a touchscreen is around six dots per inch ( dpi ) - meaning it ca n't capture the level of detail in a fingerprint - the surface area is larger than a more advanced reader			0
this allows the touch sensor ' to scan users ’ body parts , such as ears , fingers , fists , and palms by pressing them against the display			1
' to accept an incoming call , users would only need to press their ear against the phone			1
during tests with 12 participants , @entity13 classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy			1
this accuracy was highest when scanning the ear due to its more unique shape and size			0
it ’s not just ears that could be used for identification – your first , phalanges ( in your fingers ) , palm or just your fingertips could also be used ( shown )			0
this means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you a video demonstrating the technology revealed @entity130 can also be used to add multiple users to a single device			1
so , for example , if something required dual identification then both people could provide it			0
it ’s not just ears that could be used for identification - your fist , phalanges ( in your fingers ) , palm or your fingertips could also be used			1
this means that just gripping the phone could unlock it for you			2
there 's no news yet on when the feature might be made available to manufacturers , but the team says their next step is to continue testing			0
to accept an incoming call , users would only need to press their ear against the phone ( example shown )			2
during tests with 12 participants , @entity13 classified body parts with 99.98 per cent accuracy and identified users with 99.52 per cent accuracy			1

@entity22 in @entity23 reveals new method to unlock your phone
simply by holding it to your head , their technology can recognise your ear
it can also use other body parts like a fist or a palm to access your device
it removes the need for specialist hardware like fingerprint readers
