president @entity0 voiced his growing frustration over his administration 's handling of the @entity5 crisis in a closed - door meeting on wednesday			1
convening his top aides in the @entity9 room after clearing his schedule for the day , the president let it be known how angry he was about how the government had handled key elements of the response			1
this anger no doubt stemmed from the news earlier that day that not only did a second nurse , @entity17 , contract the disease while caring for @entity19 in a @entity22 , @entity21 , hospital , but that she had also been able to board a plan and travel back and forth to @entity24 , @entity25 , that weekend , while showing symptoms of a fever			1
the president put things more bluntly in the meeting , telling his aides , ' it 's not tight , ' while discussing their response efforts			0
he then placed a majority of the blame over the botched handling of the crisis on the @entity56 , who he felt did not adequately train doctors and nurses at hospital as to proper protective procedures when dealing with a patient who has the disease and who he feels has been providing shifting information about the threat categories certain individuals who may have the disease are in			1
in an attempt to coordinate the efforts of his administration , it was confirmed on friday that @entity0 had appointed vice president @entity76 's former chief of staff @entity75 to serve as @entity5 czar			2
and while @entity75 is a seasoned crisis - response operative , many are hesitant about his new role as he has no actual healthcare experience			0
getting serious : ti step up efforts , @entity0 has appointed @entity75 ( above ) , a former chief of staff for @entity76 , as @entity5 czar , a role that will have him coordinating the administration 's efforts at the same time , national security adviser @entity88 is working with other countries including @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , to try and get them to do more to respond to the outbreak			2
' it ’s not that people are n’t doing anything , ' a senior official pointed out			0
' it ’s that they ’re not yet doing enough			0
