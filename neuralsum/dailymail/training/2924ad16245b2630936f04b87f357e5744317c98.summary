@entity1 manager @entity0 bears no grudge against @entity3 following their public spat this week and insists he merely wants the @entity7 playmaker to return to shape and form			1
@entity0 and @entity3 had a public argument after the @entity12 boss accused the midfielder , who spent last season on loan at @entity16 and @entity17 , of being overweight			1
' i do n't hold grudges , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity3 posted this on his @entity21 , proving he works hard during training sessions at @entity1 @entity3 spoke to the @entity23 to hit back at his manager 's claims , and prove that he is not overweight ' he got pushed into writing a load of stuff that was n't true			1
i do n't think he 's been fined and i would n't want to fine him			1
' i 've always been a manager where people go , ' you do love a problem player '			1
' the big difference is the ones i 've had before keep producing on the pitch			1
' unfortunately at the moment @entity3 needs to produce			1
he 's got great talent			2
' he could be an incredible , incredible footballer for this football club			1
' @entity0 originally claimed that @entity3 is overweight and unfit to play for @entity1 @entity3 has played for five clubs in his professional career , including @entity17 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) @entity0 lost patience with @entity3 after last sunday 's last - gasp loss to @entity40 , which kept @entity12 bottom of the @entity42 ahead of monday 's clash with @entity44 at @entity45			1
the @entity1 boss added : " it was something that happened before the game and during the week			1
maybe i just got the needle			2
when i get the hump i do tend to say what i feel			2
" he has tested me			2
( but ) i 'm the one that 's stuck with him			2
" i 'm bang on his side			2
no - one could be more on his side than what i 've been			2
when you 're on someone 's side so much and you get let down , at some stage you tend to crack over it			2
" like with your kid misbehaving , you say ' do n't do that ' , ' do n't do that '			2
in the end you get the hump with them enough and you send them to bed , or whatever			2
that 's how i felt last sunday			0
" @entity3 kitted out in gloves and a hat in @entity1 training this week @entity0 during the press conference that saw him hit out at @entity74 @entity0 , who recalled how he rescued @entity3 from @entity76 's reserves when he was @entity76 boss , was hurt by comments made by the midfielder			1

when people say i 'm not out there all morning , that is a blatant lie			0

it 's done and dusted			0
i just want to be positive now			0
" i 've had ups and downs with him before , but i 've had more ups than downs with him			0
