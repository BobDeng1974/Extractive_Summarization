by @entity0 last updated at 12:11 am on 13th november 2011 a @entity2 family law judge seen beating his older daughter in a video she posted on @entity5 has been placed under a temporary restraining order , which his ex-wife 's attorney says effectively prevents him from visiting his younger daughter			1
under the order issued thursday by another judge , @entity13 - at - law judge @entity10 is forbidden from visiting his 10 - year - old daughter without getting permission from the girl 's mother , his ex-wife			1
the order also says @entity10 ca n't disparage the woman or drink alcohol within 24 hours of seeing his child			1
@entity10 ' attorney did not respond to a request for comment friday from @entity0			1
state district judge @entity45 scheduled a hearing for nov. 21 to decide on @entity36 ' request to have @entity10 ' visitation denied or require that it be supervised			1
@entity10 has not held court since his 23 - year - old daughter @entity24 released a secretly - recorded 2004 video of him beating her with a belt			1
disciplinarian : judge @entity10 faced public calls for his resignation after the video went viral @entity10 faced public calls for his resignation and threats after @entity24 posted the 8 - minute clip on @entity5 that shows her father viciously lashing her with a belt and trying to force her to bend over her bed to be beaten despite her pleas to stop			1
@entity36 filed an affidavit thursday claiming a dysfunctional 22 - year marriage and conflict that continued since their 2007 divorce			2
@entity35 said the furious reaction to the video triggered the legal move			2
' the impetus is she ( @entity36 ) does n't feel at first that her daughter is safe going down there to be with the judge right now , ' @entity35 said			1
' the impetus now is the result of the video , not necessarily the video itself			2
' the district attorney and federal prosecutors both declined to bring charges against @entity10 , but the @entity86 on @entity87 continues its investigation			2
last week , @entity34 police chief @entity89 said that police did not interview the younger daughter , but asked both @entity29 and @entity24 about it and there was no indication of abuse of the younger daughter			1
it comes after police revealed the judge would not face criminal charges because too much time has passed			1
@entity10 likely would have faced charges of causing injury to a child or other assault - related offences for the savage 2004 beating			1
but the five - year statutes of limitations expired so the @entity13 - at - @entity108 probably wo n't be charged for beating the cerebral palsy sufferer , @entity34 police chief @entity89 said			2
sickening : @entity2 family law judge @entity10 brutally whips his disabled daughter in footage caught on a webcam set up by the girl in 2004 when she was 16 attack : the girl , who suffers from cerebral palsy , yelps in pain as her father beats her repeatedly with the leather belt for playing on her computer it came shortly after the judge 's wife and daughter appeared in a televised interview to reveal that she had been hiding her husband 's ' secret of addiction for a long time			1

i really do n't know what the solution for him is			0
except that i really want him to seek some kind of help			0
’ all apologies : judge @entity10 ( left ) said the attack on his daughter @entity130 , who suffers from cerebral palsy ' was not as bad as it looks ' the judge was granted joint custody of his 10 - year - old daughter in his 2007 divorce			1
@entity36 , who also appeared in the video , tried to explain why she too had hit her daughter and stood aside to let her husband attack			2
she said : ' my answer to you and to the world is something that i 've been hiding for a very long time is a family secret and that 's addiction			2

' judge @entity10 , who presides mainly over cases involving children , remained unrepentant			1
he released a three - page statement earlier this month , saying his daughter posted the clip to get back at him for telling her he would be reducing the amount of financial support he gives her and taking away her @entity217			2
the statement did not include an apology for the beating , but he told @entity222 television station @entity221 that the video ' looks worse than it is , ' that he had already apologized to his daughter and that he was just disciplining his child for stealing			2
miss @entity24 , who has suffered from ataxic cerebral palsy from birth , said her condition causes problems including difficulty with balance , shaky movements of hands or feet , and difficulty with speech			0

i did every single thing that he did			0
when i leave the room he is telling me what to say , what to do			0
' the video , entitled ' family law judge beats own daughter for using the internet , please spread ' , shows the motive for the attack was because @entity272 , who suffers from cerebral palsy , had been caught downloading music to the computer in her bedroom			1

his wife then grabs the belt from him to take over , at which point he walks out only to return moments later with another belt so he can continue beating her			0
