@entity1 once offered to sell @entity2 to @entity5 side @entity3 in a £ 5million deal , former @entity1 boss @entity0 has revealed			1
@entity0 , who was in charge of the @entity9 club during the 2008 - 09 season , says @entity1 chairman @entity11 offered the then teenage prodigy to him after the club grew frustrated at his inconsistent performances and series of injury problems			1
it was the @entity18 who helped lure the @entity21 star to the club in a £ 7million deal from @entity24 in 2007 , during his time in the @entity27 hotseat			0
initally bought as a left back , @entity2 grew into a maurading left winger that saw @entity39 giants @entity38 sign him in record - breaking £ 85m where he won the @entity41 in his debut season			1
however @entity0 told @entity43 , @entity2 's outcome at @entity1 could have a lot different			1
' @entity1 saw @entity2 as a left back , but he probably was n’t the best left - back in the world , ' he said			2
' he was more creative , he had electric pace , so everybody saw that he was more suited as a forward player , and @entity50 saw that later on			0
@entity2 ( left ) initially struggled at @entity1 following a £ 7million move from @entity24 in 2007 @entity2 's ( right ) eventually became one of @entity1 's best players as he realised his potential " i saw his potential straight away , but other people did n’t see that in the early stages of his career and that led to @entity1 offering @entity2 to me when i went to @entity3			1
' we had to pay a lot of money to get him though , about five or six million , which we could n’t afford at the time			0
' i then asked @entity11 if we could take him on loan instead , but at that time it was not possible			0
' so yes , @entity3 could have bought @entity2 for £ 5million because , of course , he was not playing at that moment			0
' he could n’t get into the side , so @entity1 offered him to other clubs			0
' @entity2 ( right ) joined @entity38 in a £ 85m deal last season , helping the club win their 10th @entity41			2

@entity0 was in charge of @entity3 between 2008 - 2009
@entity0 revealed that @entity1 offered to sell @entity2 to him for £ 5 million
@entity11 offered the now @entity38 superstar away after a series of injury problems and inconsistent performances had frustrated the @entity84 club
@entity2 was instead sold to @entity38 for a record - breaking £ 85 million
