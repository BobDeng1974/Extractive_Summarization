by @entity0 with her flawless tanned skin and a perfect smile , @entity1 has become a poster girl for @entity5			0
and although she has confessed to having @entity6 and was filmed doing so for an episode of @entity8 , she denies ever having had surgery , claiming that her looks come courtesy of good genes , expensive beauty products and a great team of make - up artists			0
but what if @entity1 did n't have the luxury of all the beauty products and stylists that fame brings with it ? just your average girl : a design team decided to create what they think @entity1 would look like if she was n't famous - and the results are startling one company decided to look into what some of the biggest celebrities would look look like if they had n’t found fame - and the team of hair stylists , make - up artists , plastic surgeons and fashion consultants that come with the package			2
the design team created some concept images using existing pictures of a selection of @entity5 celebrities showing what they may look like if they lived in the mundane world			1
the design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on , such as @entity50 and his pearly @entity5 smile and @entity1 and her perfectly shaped eyebrows			2
not such a bad gal now : @entity54 looks fresh - faced and innocent in the design team 's ' non famous ' version of the singer @entity58 , is that you ? mrs o , who has admitted to having plastic surgery , looks much older with her grey hair and winkles in the images the best makeunder of the bunch is undoubtedly 33 - year - old @entity1			2
with her dark rimmed spectacles , blotchy skin and bushy brows , the star is virtually unrecognisable			0
@entity54 too has been treated to a believable transformation			0
images of @entity75 , @entity50 and @entity76 , meanwhile , are slightly more ridiculous			1
@entity50 and his crooked teeth resemble a hillbilly , while 50 - year - old @entity75 looks almost double his age with a bald head and wrinkled skin			1
taking it too far : the design team focused on features on the celebrities that they believed had clearly been professionally worked on , such as @entity50 and his perfect teeth haggered : @entity75 , 50 , looks old beyond his years in the virtually adapted image speaking about their work , www.vouchercodespro.co.uk , who helped create the images , said : ' have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a daydream wondering how you would look if you had millions in the bank and an endless amount of fashion and beauty help at your fingertips ? ' no wonder the a-listers all look so perfect when you take into the account the ridiculously long list of people whose job it is to make the @entity5 elite look effortless whilst they walk up and down the red carpet			1
' this got us thinking , what would some of the biggest celebrities look like if they had n’t become famous ? would they even still look recognisable without the teams of hair stylists , make - up artists , plastic surgeons and fashion consultants ?			0
