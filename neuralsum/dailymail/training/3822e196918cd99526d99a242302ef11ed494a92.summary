by @entity1 reporter published : 14:35 est , 24 december 2012 updated : 17:45 est , 24 december 2012 tens of thousands of people have signed an online petition calling for @entity7 @entity6 host @entity5 to be deported from the @entity8 over his gun control views			1
@entity5 has demanded tighter @entity8 gun laws following the @entity13 massacre and last week on @entity14 , he interviewed a gun advocate and called him an ' unbelievably stupid man '			1
on december 21 , a man in @entity18 launched a petition on the @entity22 e-petition website demanding @entity5 be deported immediately for ' exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of @entity8 citizens '			1
it has already garnered more than 42,000 signatures - far exceeding the 25,000 signature threshold required to get a @entity22 response			1
but @entity5 seemed unfazed by the effort to oust him			2
in a series of @entity44 messages , he urged his followers to sign the petition and in response to one article about the petition even said : ' bring it on '			0
he wrote : ' if i do get deported from @entity8 for wanting fewer gun murders , are there any other countries that will have me ? ' speaking out : the petition had already garnered more than 40,000 signatures by monday afternoon he also insisted that he is not attacking the @entity34 and only wants the @entity8 to outlaw military - style assault weapons without infringing on people 's rights			1
in response to the petition , @entity62 , the @entity7 @entity63 presenter , added on @entity44 : ' @entity8			1
it took us 40 years to get rid of @entity5			0
@entity66 do n't send him back			0
' @entity5 will have to do more than express an opinion to get booted out the country , immigration attorney @entity69 told @entity70			0
' he 's got certain rights , ' he said			0
' even as a foreign national in the @entity8 , he 's afforded various rights under national security law and due process			0
' he added that @entity5 's supposed attack on the @entity35 would probably be protected by the @entity77 , his right to free speech			2
hitting back : @entity5 has responded to the growing petition with a series of tweets outspoken : @entity5 called gun advocate @entity82 ' an unbelievably stupid man ' on his show last week his remarks would have to present ' immediate danger ' in order to break the law , but @entity69 said it is unlikely that what @entity5 has said has reached that requirement			2
the discussion was sparked after a gunman opened fire at an elementary school in @entity97 , @entity98 on december 14 , killing 20 children and six members of staff			0
following the tragedy last tuesday , @entity5 interviewed @entity82 , the executive director of @entity103			0
when @entity82 suggested that the answer to the @entity8 ’s gun problem was more firearms in schools , @entity5 responded : ' you ’re an unbelievably stupid man are n't you ? you have absolutely no coherent argument			1
you do n't actually give a damn about the gun murder rate in @entity8			2
