by @entity1 reporter some of the most familiar wading birds flocking to @entity5 estuaries in winter have seen major declines in the past decade , conservationists have warned			1
the latest results from the @entity8 have revealed that ringed plovers , redshanks , dunlin , curlew and oystercatchers , which are all among the eight most abundant winter wading bird species in the @entity5 , have all seen populations drop significantly			1
ringed plovers have suffered declines of 39 per cent in ten years , while redshank numbers fell by more than a quarter and the situation for dunlin is almost as bad , with declines of 23 per cent			1
conservationists have warned that populations of wading birds coming to @entity5 in winter have decreased rapidly in the last ten years , with redshanks ( pictured ) declining by more than a quarter curlew numbers have fallen 17 per cent and oystercatcher numbers are down 15 per cent in the ten years to june 2012 , according to the @entity8 , which involves data collected by thousands of volunteers			1
the most abundant waders found on @entity5 estuaries in winter are dunlin , with an estimated 350,000 birds , oystercatcher , with around 320,000 individuals , and knot , with 320,000 birds			2
knots have also seen numbers decline , by 7 per cent in ten years			2
but there is good news for species that were relatively scarce a few decades ago , with avocet numbers rising by 61 per cent in a decade and black - tailed godwits increasing by 57 per cent			0
wildlife experts said the reasons for the declines of some of the most abundant wintering waders on @entity5 estuaries were not fully understood , but it was likely to be due to a combination of factors			0
waterbird counts from across north west @entity53 show that species are shifting north - eastwards in response to milder winters			0
@entity58 population declines in the @entity5 may also be due to fewer young waders being successfully bred and reared in the @entity60 , which is experiencing rapid warming			0
@entity62 numbers have fallen 17 per cent in the last decade , as researchers say the decline is indicative of the state of @entity5 's environment @entity67 , head of species monitoring at the @entity69 , said : ' the declines in waders and other wintering waterbirds in the @entity5 over the past decade or more , as revealed by the @entity8 , are indicative of wider concerns about the state of our environment			1
' they demonstrate the unprecedented period of change that these waterbirds are undergoing , and highlight the need for a step change in monitoring and relevant conservation action if we are to avert continued biodiversity loss			0
' millions of waterbirds spend the winter on the @entity5 's wetlands , particularly estuaries which provide a rich source of food and many of which are legally protected			0
around 15 species of waders winter on @entity5 estuaries in internationally important numbers , with at least one estuary supporting more than 1 % of the international population			1
@entity5 estuaries are also important to many wildfowl such as geese and swans , and other wader species which are present in smaller numbers during the winter or passing through in spring and autumn			2

numbers of wading birds coming to @entity5 in winter are in sharp decline
ringed plover population *shrunk* by 39 per cent , redshanks by *26* per cent
conservationists say drop raises concerns about state of environment
