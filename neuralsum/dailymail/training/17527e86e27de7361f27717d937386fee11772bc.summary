by political editor published : 18:20 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 07:41 est , 24 september 2013 @entity2 will build 200,000 homes a year by 2020 , @entity1 will pledge today as he sets out plans for a new generation of garden cities and new towns			2
the @entity2 leader will tell his party 's annual conference in @entity11 that a shortage of housing is central to @entity15 's ' cost of living crisis ' , leaving millions of working people unable to afford the houses they want			1
and he will also promise to cancel a planned @entity19 cut in corporation tax for 80,000 big companies to fund lower business rates for small firms			1
touching moment : labour leader @entity1 and his wife @entity25 in their hotel room in @entity11 , as he gets ready to give his keynote speech to his party 's annual conference this afternoon hugs : @entity25 smiles as goes to hug her husband on the balcony of their hotel room in @entity11 the @entity2 leader will today attempt to steal the @entity38 mantle as the party of ‘ vibrant , dynamic ’ small enterprise , which he says will drive the recovery			1
he will echo @entity44 ’s 1980 attack on @entity45 , saying voters should ask themselves at the 2015 election : ‘ am i better off than i was five years ago ? ’ yesterday , he staged a one - man walkout as union boss @entity49 warned @entity2 had ‘ no future ’ unless it bowed to the unions ’ demands			1
he stalked off the conference stage as the @entity55 leader rose to declare @entity2 was now ‘ our party ’			1
mr @entity49 , who received a standing ovation , quipped at the @entity1 ’s departing back : ‘ i am sorry that @entity1 has left the platform but , anyway , thank you			2
’ @entity2 will cancel a planned @entity19 cut in corporation tax for 80,000 big companies to fund lower business rates for small firms , @entity1 claims dressed up : speaker 's wife @entity66 arrives at the @entity68 today in a striking blue dress but despite the public spat , he later told a fringe meeting that unions were getting a ‘ warmer reception ’ from mr @entity1 than they had from @entity2			1
mr @entity1 will use his conference speech today to outline proposals to loosen the planning system to allow dozens of new towns to be built , expand state - funded childcare and crack down on rip - off energy firms			2
however , it is his decision to hit bigger companies that employ millions of people to fund a tax break for small firms that will prove most controversial – and almost certainly infuriate business groups			1
he will pledge to reverse a planned cut in corporation tax from 21p to 20p if he wins power in 2015			1
that will cost the 80,000 largest firms £ 340million in the first year and £ 785million in the next			1
yesterday , he staged a one - man walkout as union boss @entity49 warned @entity2 had ' no future ' unless it bowed to the unions ' demands @entity2 would use the money to cut business rates on properties with an annual rental value of £ 50,000 or less , so that in 2015 they return to the level of 2014			1
@entity2 would then freeze the rates until 2016			2
the move would benefit the owners of 1.5million shops , pubs and other small businesses by an average of nearly £ 450 over two years			1
mr @entity1 will say the move demonstrates @entity2 ’s commitment to creating a ‘ @entity111 economy ’ and to becoming ‘ the party of small business ’			1
he will say that while the economy appears to have turned a corner , living standards are still getting worse			2
many new jobs are ‘ too low paid ’ , he will say , while gains in the economy are ‘ scooped up by a privileged few ’			2
mr @entity1 , who this week declared he was bringing socialism back , will wage class warfare , telling activists : ‘ they used to say , “ a rising tide lifts all boats ”			2
now the rising tide seems to lift the yachts			2
‘ at the general election in 2015 , you should ask yourself , “ am i better off now than i was five years ago ? ” you ’ve made the sacrifices			1
but you ’ve not got the rewards			0
‘ will the pain be worth it for the gain under this government ? no. ’ he will insist that the prime minister ’s talk of @entity15 being in a ‘ global race ’ means a ‘ race to the bottom ’ with ‘ the lowest wages , the worst terms and conditions and the fewest rights at work ’			0
mr @entity1 will set out plans for a @entity145 , led by former @entity147 chairman sir @entity146 , which will work with councils to identify sites for new towns			0
it will prepare a legislative framework for @entity2 to start building immediately if it wins the 2015 general election			0
mr @entity1 will accuse @entity156 of presiding over the lowest level of home - building of any prime minister since the 1920s , resulting in a situation where fewer than half of the homes needed to keep up with demand are being built			0
with just 87,000 homes built this year , @entity15 is facing the biggest housing crisis in a generation , he will say			0
an average family needs 22 years to save for a typical deposit on a home , compared with three years in 1997 , mr @entity1 will say			1
by the end of the next @entity174 in 2020 , numbers of houses built should be increased to at least 200,000 a year , he will tell activists in his keynote conference speech			0
the @entity177 will be told to develop a detailed plan so that @entity2 can hit the ground running on entering office - including the drafting of new legislation and detailed plans for new towns in specific locations			0
any attack on a member of the armed forces will be a specific criminal offence with a tougher penalty , under @entity2 plans announced yesterday			0
@entity192 , the party ’s defence spokesman , outlined a new @entity194 to give the forces priority for health services and housing , support with finding a job , and protection from discrimination			1
he said @entity2 will table amendments to the @entity203 in the coming weeks to bring in a specific criminal offence for attacking forces personnel ‘ ensuring they are treated with the dignity their bravery deserves ’			0
mr @entity192 told the @entity211 conference in @entity11 : ‘ it ’s sad that those who fight for our country might need the protection of our laws , but some do			0
’ he said the @entity219 had neglected soldiers ’ housing , and scrapped specialists and equipment , jeopardising safety on the front line			0
in a jibe at international development secretary @entity227 he said : ‘ this is a government that during the crucial @entity232 vote two of their own ministers locked themselves away in a soundproof room			0
it ’s little wonder this government wo n’t listen			0
’ miss @entity227 and @entity238 minister @entity237 claimed they missed the vote because they were chatting in a soundproofed room			0
mr @entity192 said despite the @entity2 vote against the principle of military intervention in @entity232 they had to remain ‘ prepared to intervene ’ in other cases .			0

will try to steal @entity38 mantle as party of ' vibrant , dynamic ' small enterprise
will ' cancel planned cut in corporation tax for 80,000 big companies '
says voters should ask ' am i better off than i was five years ago ? '
