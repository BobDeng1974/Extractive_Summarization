a safety gadget has been devised for athletes to prevent serious head injuries occurring			1
the @entity4 device monitors the movement of players , keeping track of any dangerous impacts			1
any potential threat causes the clip - worn on the player 's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees , as well as parents and coaches on the sidelines			1
a threat causes the clip - worn on the player 's head - to vibrate and send a wireless message to referees , as well as parents and coaches in the event of a potentially dangerous impact the gadget was created by ceo @entity33 from @entity34 , @entity35 after he suffered from concussion himself			1
a concussion is a brain injury and all are serious			2
most occur without loss of consciousness			0
@entity43 and proper response to concussions when they first occur can help prevent further injury or even death			2
a concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury , or @entity51 , caused by a bump , blow or jolt to the head that can change the way your brain normally works			1
concussions can also occur from a blow to the body that causes the head to move rapidly back and forth			2
even what seems to be a mild bump or blow to the head can be serious			2
concussions can occur in any sport or recreation activity			0
so all coaches , parents , and athletes need to learn concussion signs and symptoms and what to do if a concussion occurs			1
it is hoped the @entity4 will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury			1
the company are aiming to start shipping the product in april 2015 , with a @entity84 campaign currently taking place to raise £ 36,000 ( $ 60,000 )			2

how could this have been prevented ? ' the gadget was created by @entity106 from @entity35 after he suffered a head injury			1
when activated and an impact is detected , referees and coaches can be alerted to serious head injuries and take action			1
it is hoped the gadget will help reduce serious concussion by encouraging sportsmen to stop play at the time of injury the sensor , which has a range of over a hundred yards , stays connected anywhere on the field to ensure a dangerous impact never goes unnoticed			1
when an incident is detected , officials , parents and coaches can be immediately notified that the athlete should be medically evaluated on the sideline with the app 's built - in cognitive test			1
the results of this test are compared with baseline scores and used with the impact data to enable parents and coaches to make more informed decisions			2
all of this data is then stored in the cloud , for quick and easy access by the athlete and their doctor			0
