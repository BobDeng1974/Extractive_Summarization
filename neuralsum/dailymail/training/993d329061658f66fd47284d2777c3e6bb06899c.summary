by @entity0 for @entity1 this chilled out brown bear looks like he has all the necessities of life , as he relaxes in the river with a tasty , freshly - caught salmon			1
the beast looks rather like he is sitting back in a swimming pool with an ice cream cone - and he deserves his rest after a hard day of competing with others for the best fishing spots			0
the hungry bears waited at @entity18 in the @entity19 , @entity20 , as the salmon made their way up the river			1
as the fish try to jump from the water the bears attempt to pluck them out of the air with their jaws or grab hold of their slippery skin with their paws			1
they waste no time gobbling them down when they succeed , remaining in the water to eat before getting back to work			0
c'mere you : one of the bears grabs at an unfortunate salmon with its claws , hoping to soon be tucking into a tasty , fishy meal what have you got there ? a bear peers up at one of its friends who has succeeded in getting a catch ( left ) , while another stalks through the icy waters ( right ) tuck in : this bear strides victoriously away from the more treacherous waters to calmer tides to enjoy its prize which lies limply in its mouth the photos were taken by @entity89 , a 32 - year - old from @entity90 , @entity91 , who has spent years photographing brown bears in @entity94 and polar bears in @entity96 , but had never been to @entity20 - home of around 30,000 grizzlies - before			1
he said : ' large dominant males do not leave their favourite places without a real confrontation which the younger would be wrong to try			0
depending on the bears , size , age , weight there are several fishing techniques			2
' some wait patiently at the foot of the fall until the salmon runs between their legs , a simple technique and effective that requires minimal effort			0
white water fishing : the salmon have to undergo an incredible journey upstream to get to their breeding ground , but thanks to the bears many never make it snapped : two bears caught on camera by 32 - year - old @entity91 photographer @entity89 at @entity18 in the @entity19 , @entity20 vicious fight : two bears clash amid tumultuous white waters as they both seek the best spot for catching the delicious salmon ' others stand at the top of the fall and catch salmon in flight with open jaws and legs ready to strike as the first fish passes			1
' what is also surprising is the delicacy with which the bears eat their salmon			2
' they always begin by removing the skin - which they eat - but with their jaws and legs it seems impossible to do so accurately			0
' it is very likely that with a chef 's knife i could not do as well in my kitchen			0
' setting the scene : there are around 30,000 brown bears in @entity20			1
this was the first time the photographer had travelled to the state to photograph them you 're mine : a soaked , dishevelled bear lumbers off with a bloody fish in its mouth , but will soon be back to work trying to catch more splashing about : water crashes around this huge , beautiful beast who is taking a minute out to spy where it will try and catch its next victim			2

brown bears snapped fishing for salmon in rough waters at @entity18 in the @entity19 , @entity20
