but now the face of hill farming may soon change forever with the introduction of a battery - powered airborne robot to track and round up flocks			2
the drone , developed by @entity17 @entity16 , costs a few hundred pounds and could eventually be controlled by smartphone			1
drone pack horse : one of the experimental robots developed by the @entity22 @entity21			0
it can carry 400 pounds , walk on ice , and navigate streams and ditches it uses cameras and image recognition software to find sheep and cows even in remote areas			1
@entity16 , 27 , a postgraduate student at @entity33 , @entity34 , told the @entity35 : ' it 's amazing that the technology is becoming so developed that this sort of thing is possible			2
' the son of a farmer , he has designed a prototype @entity44 ( @entity44 ) to be used as an eye in the sky to manage and monitor livestock on very large and remote estates			1
inventor : @entity16 developed his eye in the sky aid for farmers at university in @entity34 he used an @entity54 2 with a camera attached to the bottom to allow the user to get a bird ’s eye view and came up with a computer programme which instructs the drone to locate , recognise and track livestock			1
although the drone can be controlled via @entity63 on a computer , the aim is for farmers to be able to control it using an @entity66 or smartphone			1
@entity16 said : ' the number of robots for professional use is increasing significantly so it is very important to be up - to - date with robotics - it ’s the future and the present			0
' he said his prototype was designed with @entity76 sheep farmers in mind , many of whom spend large amounts of time and cover many miles monitoring their livestock			1
in @entity22 , the @entity22 @entity21 in charge of military technology , has developed a robot dog that can run faster than @entity87 , follow its leader , and respond to commands the @entity90 , or ' @entity91 ' as it has been nicknamed , is so lifelike , that it can catch itself slipping on ice , easily navigates streams and ditches and and can carrying 400 pounds			2
other drones include hand grenade - sized robots that can be thrown into @entity99 rebel compounds			0
former one man presenter @entity100 was unimpressed by the technological breakthrough			0
