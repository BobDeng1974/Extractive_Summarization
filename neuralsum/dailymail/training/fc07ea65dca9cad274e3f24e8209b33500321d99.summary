by @entity0 published : 04:18 est , 3 november 2012 updated : 08:29 est , 3 november 2012 @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 personnel are poised to take over duties from prison and probation officers if they conduct an illegal strike			1
the @entity9 confirmed servicemen and women are being trained for the positions as trade unions consider industrial action over the private running of jails			1
forces are learning how to conduct non-prisoner - facing duties such as patrolling jail borders and checking @entity20			1
change of pace : army personnel are among those who will be on prison duty if the strike goes ahead after being deployed they will have six hours notice to reach the prisons if a strike does take place			1
six state - run @entity30 prisons and one other are up for competitive tender and their futures are set to be decided within a few weeks			2
private security firms @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 are among the bidders and if they win they may choose to make some prison staff redundant which could provoke strikes			0
officers and ranks from 12 @entity4 bases were brought in for training in @entity43 at @entity44			1
an @entity9 spokesman explained : ' the @entity46 routinely train for a range of contingencies , but such training does not mean that personnel will necessarily deploy			0
' the @entity9 has a long - standing contingency arrangement with the @entity52 to provide assistance in the event of unlawful strike action by prison officers			0
' training : members of the @entity4 have already gone to @entity43 to learn the required skills a tasking order sent to @entity4 officers by @entity61 shows the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) has notified the @entity9 that they will need help , as revealed by the @entity64			2
the order reads : ' @entity62 has given the @entity9 official notice in order to force generate and train personnel to undertake non-prisoner - facing duties in support of @entity62 in the event of industrial action in prisons in @entity74 and @entity75			1
' from the day of activation , personnel will be held at six hours notice to arrive at identified prisons			1
' all personnel will be able to maintain this state of readiness from their parent unit			0
' the @entity81 denied all knowledge of the strike on friday night but because they are banned by law from taking industrial action they rarely declare their intentions in advance			0
in may around 80 per cent of jails lost their staff to a surprise strike targeted against public sector reforms , although it only lasted a few hours			2
exercise was cancelled and prisoners were kept in their cells with only a few staff on hand to provide them with food and medication			0
even criminal court proceedings were put on hold because captives could not be taken to court as the guards had left their posts to protest			0
the @entity52 insisted on friday night that they are planning to avoid a strike and will try to keep close relations with unions in order to do so			0
servicemen and women are no strangers to helping out where required , with over 18,000 assisting at the @entity114 .			2
