@entity0 , suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed in the school playground when he was 10 a 10 - year - old boy nearly died after suffering a cardiac arrest in the school playground			1
@entity0 's heart stopped for a staggering 12 minutes after he collapsed while running around with friends during the morning break			1
he was playing @entity9 – a game in which children run from one side of a playing field to another without being caught by one of the ‘ bulldogs ’ , who often employ forceful tactics to trap runners , including rugby tackling opponents to the ground			1
teachers across the country have called for the game to be banned , claiming it is dangerous and leads to children becoming injured			0
in the middle of playing the game , @entity0 suffered a cardiac arrest			1
this is where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or ‘ fibrillates ’ instead			2
his heart suddenly stopped beating blood around his body and he collapsed and lost consciousness			1
the 10 - year - old was later diagnosed with the same heart condition as footballer @entity44 , a former @entity45 player who collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first half of @entity45 's @entity49 quarter - final against @entity50 in 2012			1
mr @entity44 was ' effectively dead ' for 78 minutes and had to be shocked 15 times before his heart restarted			2
teachers at @entity0 ’s school in @entity54 , were able to give @entity55 until paramedics arrived and saved his life			1
his father , @entity58 , 45 , got a call from the school at around 11am on march 2 , and was told to get to the school immediately			0
he said : ' i was working around the corner so i was able to get straight over there and when i saw @entity0 on the ground i knew he was dead			1
' teachers were giving him cpr but i could see he was grey and lifeless			0
i could n't even go to him			0
' luckily he was brought back to life when paramedics @entity71 and @entity73 and emergency care assistant @entity70 arrived , and were able to save him by giving @entity0 two shocks with a defibrillator			1
a cardiac arrest happens when the heart stops pumping blood around your body			1
the most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation ( @entity86 )			1
ventricular fibrillation happens when the electrical activity of your heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or ' fibrillates ' instead			2
someone who is having a cardiac arrest will suddenly lose consciousness and will stop breathing or stop breathing normally			0
unless immediately treated by @entity55 this always leads to death within minutes			0
it is possible to survive and recover from a cardiac arrest , with the right treatment			0
@entity103 fibrillation - which causes an arrest - can sometimes be corrected by giving an electric shock through the chest wall , by using a device called a defibrillator			1
source : @entity110 @entity0 , who turned 11 two weeks ago , was rushed to @entity111 , where he seemed to be making a recovery			2
just as he seemed to be improving , he suffered another attack , and was transferred to @entity114			0
mr @entity0 , a builder and father - of - three , said : ' we were beside ourselves with worry			2
' @entity0 is super-fit , he plays football three times a week and goes boxing two times a week			2
‘ how could this happen in someone so young ? ’ @entity0 ’s mother , @entity123 , 43 , added : ' can you imagine what we were going through ? ' we did n't even have a clue what had happened to @entity0			2
‘ we did n't think for a moment that he could have had a heart problem			0
' i had dropped him off to school that morning and he was his happy little self			0
‘ we had no warning			0
@entity0 is a bit of a joker so when he collapsed even his friends thought he was messing around , until they noticed he was n't breathing			1
' while @entity0 was in hospital doctors fitted him with an implantable cardioverter - defibrillator ( @entity139 ) to shock his heart back into rhythm should it ever stop again			1
@entity44 , 26 , was fitted with the same implant after his high profile collapse three years ago			0
mr @entity0 said : ' at the moment we do n't know what has caused @entity0 to have a heart problem			1
' @entity0 , who is now 11 , suffered a series of cardiac arrests , where the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body , and was treated in intensive care @entity0 had a device fitted to his heart which will shock it back into beating if it ever stops again			1
he is pictured in hospital with boxer @entity159 mr and mrs @entity123 are due to have tests to see if @entity0 's heart condition is hereditary			1
his brother and sister , @entity162 , 27 , and @entity163 , 20 , may also have to be tested			0
mrs @entity123 , said : ' i can not thank each and every person who played a part in saving @entity0 's life and helped with his recovery , enough			2
' teachers , paramedics and hospital staff have all been amazing			0
' as a parent it is your worst nightmare to receive a phone call like i did from school , when you sent your healthy 10 - year - old child there fit and well that morning			0
' doctors have said that the fact that @entity0 was running around at the time of the attack may have helped him - because it meant his heart was pumping			1
' @entity0 knows he is lucky to be alive , but his dream of being a professional footballer has been taken from him			1
@entity0 had played with both @entity191 and @entity192 youth teams and dreamed of playing for his beloved @entity191 when he got older			1
mr @entity0 said : ' doctors have said he can play with friends as long as he does n't exert himself too much			2
‘ they 've said that if he can exercise and talk at the same time then that 's okay , but playing professionally is out of the question			2
@entity0 suffered from the same heart condition as @entity44 , a @entity45 football player who collapsed after a cardiac arrest during the first half of @entity45 's @entity49 quarter - final against @entity50 ' maybe @entity0 would not have been a professional footballer but he is gutted , understandably			1
' mrs @entity123 said : ' when @entity0 feels down we tell him that he is very lucky to be here and that makes him feel better			1
' but he is still recovering and sometimes he feels scared , but he is still getting used to his defibrillator			0
it 's a big thing he has had to deal with			0
' for his birthday he did n't want a sleepover as we had originally planned , instead we went for a day out to @entity209			0
' @entity0 has come a long way and even returned to school this month			2
' he 's had a fantastic recovery so far , which is all down to the fast response from the school staff and the paramedics			0
' he 's doing better than we could have ever imagined			0
i am so grateful we still have our little boy with us			0
