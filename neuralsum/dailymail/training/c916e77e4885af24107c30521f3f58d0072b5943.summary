the @entity0 was unaware for four days that a man had fired a high - powered rifle at the @entity3 in 2011 in a ' fumbled ' response that left the @entity5 furious , says a new report			1
officers allegedly performed a string of security lapses after @entity10 shot at least seven bullets at the executive mansion in @entity13 from his car			2
at the time , president @entity16 , his wife @entity15 and their older daughter @entity5 were not at home , but their younger daughter @entity18 and mrs @entity20 's mother , @entity18 , were inside			1
it comes as the @entity0 is facing more questions over its ability to protect the first family after a knife - wielding man jumped the @entity3 fence and made it to the front doors last friday			1
above , officers inspect a smashed window broken : one of the bullets smashed a window on the second floor , just inches from the family 's living room first family : at the time , president @entity16 ( left ) , his wife @entity15 ( far right ) and their older daughter @entity5 ( second right ) were not at the executive mansion , but younger daughter @entity18 ( third right ) was inside the agency 's apparently bungled response to the shooting on november 11 , 2011 , was detailed last night in an investigation by the @entity56			1
in the incident , @entity10 , then 21 , parked his black @entity34 south of the mansion , before pointing his semi-automatic pistol out of the passenger window			0
he then aimed it directly at the @entity5 ' home and fired off a series of bullets , one of which smashed a window on the second floor , just inches from the family 's living room			2
another bullet got stuck in a window frame , while others smashed into the roof , causing nearly $ 100,000 worth of damage			0
within seconds of the shots , a @entity3 usher reportedly expressed concerns about the safety of @entity5 , who was due to arrive back at the mansion imminently			1
the usher told the staff to keep her sister @entity18 and ms @entity82 inside , before locking all of the doors after @entity5 returned with her detail at 9.40pm , the @entity56 said			0
attack : within seconds of the shots , a @entity3 usher expressed concerns about the safety of @entity5 , who was due to arrive back at the mansion imminently , according to a new report by the @entity56 weapon : @entity0 officers , in accordance with protocol , rushed to respond , before they were reportedly told ' no shots have been fired ... stand down ' , by their supervisor			1
above , the gun used by @entity10 fleeing : @entity10 is pictured allegedly fleeing from @entity13 aboard a freight train in this 2011 photo introduced by @entity100 prosecutors as evidence in @entity102 in @entity13 meanwhile , @entity0 officers , in accordance with protocol , rushed to respond , with one stationed under the second - floor terrace withdrawing her handgun			1
however , they reportedly halted their response when they were wrongly informed , ' no shots have been fired ... stand down ' , by their supervisor			1
the supervisor claimed the noise had instead stemmed from the backfire from a nearby construction vehicle , the @entity56 said			0
even after the fact that shots were fired had been confirmed , supervisors initially theorized that rival gangs in separate cars had gotten into a gunfight near the mansion 's front lawn , it said			2
executive mansion : it apparently took the @entity0 four days to conclude that gunshots had struck the @entity3 ( pictured ) - with their findings mainly based on the discovery of broken glass by a housekeeper the shots were reportedly only connected to the @entity3 four days later when a housekeeper noticed broken glass and a chunk of cement lying on the floor inside			1
less than a week later , mrs @entity20 , who had arrived back in @entity13 from @entity133 after spending the @entity134 weekend with her husband , reportedly arranged a meeting with then - @entity0 director @entity137			1
during the encounter , she addressed mr @entity137 so sharply that she could be heard through a closed door , the @entity56 reported			0
angry : president @entity20 was ' infuriated ' by the @entity0 's response to the shooting president @entity20 , who was continuing from @entity133 to @entity142 , was also said to have been ' infuriated ' by the @entity0 's response to the shooting			1
one day after the broken glass was spotted , @entity10 , from @entity143 , was arrested			0
he was later sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to firing an assault rifle at the @entity3			0
although prosecutors had initially charged @entity10 with attempting to assassinate president @entity20 , they agreed to drop the charge as part of a plea deal last year			2
the @entity56 alleges that some @entity0 officers knew immediately that shots had been fired into the @entity3 , but that they were ' largely ignored '			1
' some were afraid to dispute their bosses ' conclusions ' that the shooting was not directed at the @entity3 , it said			0
the agency allegedly conducted only a cursory inspection of the @entity3 for evidence or damage , while key witnesses were not interviewed until after bullets were found			2
the suspect was able to park his car on a public street , take several shots and then speed off without being detected , the @entity56 noted			0
it added that it was ' sheer luck ' that @entity10 was identified as the shooter , mainly because the troubled and jobless 21 - year - old wrecked his car seven blocks away and left his gun inside			0
the recent allegations were unearthed by the @entity56 following interviews with agents , investigators and government officials , as well as the review of hundreds of documents			0
it comes just a week after @entity179 , 42 , was arrested inside the presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn , the @entity0 said			1
president @entity20 and his family were not in the mansion at the time			1
previous incident : last week , @entity179 , 42 , was arrested inside the presidential residence with a knife in his pants after making it over the fence and running across the lawn ( pictured ) , the @entity0 said @entity3 pair : @entity179 , a 42 - year - old @entity194 veteran ( left ) and @entity195 , a 19 - year - old college student ( right ) were both arrested after trying to get into the @entity3 within 24 hours of one another less than 24 hours later , @entity195 , 19 , was taken in by officers after allegedly driving a car up to a screening point then refusing to leave when he was asked			1
the two attempts to gain entry to the @entity3 prompted the @entity0 to increase security by stepping up patrols around the building			2
it has been suggested they could set up security checkpoints around the building for the public			0
in a statement to the @entity210 , the @entity0 said it ' implemented both personnel and structural enhancements ' following a review of the 2011 incident			2
it also employed ' other physical and technical enhancements , including additional surveillance cameras			0
' a @entity0 official , who requested anonymity for lack of authorization to comment for attribution , said the delay in understanding what happened that night was not the result of misconduct or incompetence			0
instead , they said it was ' an uncertain situation ' that included echoing shots from a quarter mile away and confused initial witness reports			0
' i 'm not saying this was our shining moment , but we never stopped looking for this guy , ' the official said .			0
