soon @entity2 and @entity7 were recreating his iconic 1976 ‘ @entity58 ’ image of model @entity53 opening a bottle of bubbly onto a glass balanced on her bottom			1
photoshop and other technical methods were clearly used to create the image of champagne flying through the air , but mr @entity7 has insisted that very little of @entity2 's body was altered			1
@entity2 was married in @entity28 earlier this year , and owns a flat in the city along with her husband , the rapper @entity67			2

earlier on wednesday , @entity2 shared the two cover shots with her 21 million @entity108 followers , captioning the bottom shot with the magazine cover line : ' break the @entity111 '			1
trending : @entity2 certainly lit up the internet with comical discussion of her new magazine cover , available online at @entity115 and late on thursday more pictures from the shoot emerged with the reality star posing full frontal nude in two extremely risqué new shots			1
the images , which @entity22 has chosen to censor , make no attempt at discretion as the naked @entity2 faces the camera front on , grinning happily			2
in an interview published on @entity127 , @entity21 's editorial director @entity125 explained that it was all @entity2 's idea			1
' @entity2 ’s attitude was " if we ’re gon na do it , let ’s really go there , " ' he said			2
' and it was her idea to take off her clothes and show more than her butt			1
but we [ @entity21 ] did n’t say " let ’s do a cover with your butt hanging out			1
" ' she said she was willing to take her clothes off and one thing lead to another			0
' and @entity2 certainly shows no sign of nerves in the shoot , as she holds her dress down around her knees			2
in a second new photo from the inside spread @entity2 can be seen slipping out of her sparkling cocktail dress , her shining behind turned towards the camera to reveal her bare breast			2
smeared in baby oil , @entity2 looks delighted with herself as she smiles at the camera			2

' it was someone who she works with a lot so she felt comfortable			0
' ' which one 's real ? ' referencing what is most certainly a @entity167 - enhanced image of @entity2 's bottom , @entity163 posted a side - by - side comparison of her bare bum on @entity108 mythical beast : one user turned @entity2 into a beautiful centaur and as for the talk that the booty had been digitally enhanced , @entity125 had this to say : ' [ there was ] much less [ retouching ] than people think			1
' that ’s really what she looks like			0
i would say it ’s the normal amount of retouching that ’s on a normal cover			0
' he also revealed : ' it is not padded			0
that is all really her			0
' but already , the cyber world was overrun with memes parodying the covers			0
one was shot with her looking coquettishly over her shoulder with her bare bottom on full display			0
a second was the @entity58 remake			0
but it was the booty shot which captured everyone 's imagination , with @entity163 being one of the first celebs to take a stab at mocking it			0
referencing what is most certainly a photoshop - enhanced bottom , @entity163 posted a side - by - side comparison of her bare bum with @entity2 's on @entity108			1
the comedienne , 39 , captioned her image : ' can you believe more than 2 a * * can fit on the same screen ? guess which one 's real			0
' @entity221 : a lot of users compared the reality star to a glazed donut brits do it better : @entity2 is compared to @entity228 @entity2 and the giant peach : the soft fruit was another thing that looked like her behind @entity232 's up ! an alternative talk on the @entity2 snap came from @entity235 in the image @entity236 wears nothing but her bra as her underwear is pulled down while she snaps a mirror selfie in a bathroom			1
glee actress @entity243 - whose looks ( and style choices ) have been compared to @entity2 's - also had something to say			1
' i normally do n't			0
but ... you 're someone 's mother ... ' the 27 - year - old actress commented on @entity108 , referring to @entity2 and husband @entity67 's toddler daughter @entity252			1
@entity2 got some support though too , including from @entity22 's @entity47 editor at large @entity255 who described the image as one that will be ' forever etched in the memory '			1
pouring cold water on the internet trolls who had come out to mock @entity2 , @entity255 continued : ' it ’s time for me to make a shocking admission : i like and admire @entity265			1
meanwhile , the internet continued to go to town creating their own versions of the image , from centaurs to docking stations			0
twitter user @ @entity274 was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the @entity21 image , tweeting his own version with the caption : ' @entity2 looks so much like a centaur in @entity21 , i figured i 'd take it one step further			1
' @entity2 's rear becomes the rump of a horse , turning the reality star into a centaur			1
out and about : on wednesday afternoon the reality star was pictured arriving at the @entity288 hotel in @entity289 for her pregnant sister @entity290 's baby shower mommy duty : @entity2 brought along her toddler daughter @entity252 ; @entity295 cover attracted criticism from actress @entity243 who commented on @entity108 : ' you 're someone 's mother ' lashing out : @entity2 's style stalker @entity243 criticised @entity2 's mag cover , writing on @entity108 ' you are someone 's mother ' @ @entity302 killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping @entity306 's face onto @entity2 's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming ' @entity309 ! ' food items has also been another way to describe @entity2 's glistening rear ; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons			1
' @entity2 ' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star , and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of @entity323			2
@entity228 wearing that bridesmaid dress at her sister 's @entity325 was also used as a comparision , though really the @entity328 behind did n't really ' do it better ' than @entity2			1
another tweeter highlighted the mother - of - one 's gravitational pull by surrounding her derriere with asteroids			0
the user also gave @entity2 a surrealist makeover by photoshopping her bottom onto her face for quadruple the cheeky impact			0
one user even compared the image of @entity2 to that of a @entity345 doll , as @ @entity346 pointed out : ' @entity2 literally looks like a plastic & unrealistic @entity345 doll			0
look at her waist in comparison to her body			0
' it does seem the magazine have done their best to photoshop the reality star 's waist to oblivion and make a behind look bigger than @entity359 's @entity358			0
loved up : earlier on wednesday , @entity2 shared a cut picture of herself getting a kiss from husband @entity67 support : and of course @entity67 had nothing but good things to hashtag about his wife 's racy cover shoot just under a fortnight ago , @entity2 stepped out looking far curvier as she joined her husband @entity67 at the 2014 @entity369 honouring @entity370 and @entity371			2
of course the rapper , who only follows @entity2 on @entity373 , tweeted his approval of the cover with the simple hashtag ' @entity376 '			0
while all this was going on , it was business as usual for @entity2 , who was spotted out at a @entity289 hotel with her family for her pregnant sister @entity290 's baby shower			2
however @entity2 did n't get exactly what she wanted ... the internet seems to be working perfectly fine .			2

@entity7 tells colleague that they ' were by no means a caricature of @entity2 , but art ' after the poses were parodied on the internet
legendary @entity8 photographer ' worked very well ' with @entity2
meanwhile , @entity21 magazine said it was ' @entity2 's idea to show more than her butt ' and that her body was not altered that much
