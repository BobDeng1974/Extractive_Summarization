@entity0 has again voiced his disaffection with snooker , claiming he is just ' using ' the game and has not yet committed to entering next month 's @entity4			1
the 39 - year - old , who has won the @entity6 , the @entity7 and the @entity9 title five times each , has struggled for much of his career with the mental aspect of the game and the demands of the tour circuit			2
his achievements in recent years are outstanding , winning the @entity16 having barely played all season and the 2014 @entity6 despite suffering with a fractured ankle			2
@entity0 claims that snooker does not offer the financial reward and security that it once did @entity0 also said that he has contemplated not entering the snooker @entity4 next month @entity23 celebrates winning the 2014 @entity6 but hit out at the prize money on offer to players @entity27 into last 16 but as this year 's @entity9 build - up begins , his commitment is once more in question			1
' snooker is no longer what it once was for me			1
i just use snooker , rather than letting it use me , ' he told the @entity36			2
' i know it sounds crazy but i was n't even sure if i was going to enter the worlds			2
i probably will but it 's got to the point where i want to give snooker only 20 per cent of my time			1
' it 's not something i 'm that bothered about			0
it 's probably one of my least favourite tournaments			0
seventeen days is too long			0
' but as a kid , i dreamed of being world champion			0
( then ) i thought if i can win three or four , that would be great			0
three ? you 're getting to be a great player			0
four ? you 're on a level with @entity51 , who is a master of the game			0
so i 'm really happy to have won it five times			0
' it is a familiar refrain from @entity0			1
he threatened not to take up his place in the @entity7 , polling his @entity58 followers for advice only to announce his entry around an hour later			0
the switch in the world rankings format , from points to a money list , played into @entity0 's hands by allowing him to ' play the system ' - as he put it in 2013 - by focusing on the more lucrative tournaments			1
@entity0 claimed the @entity4 tournament is one of his least favourite events due to its length @entity0 has won the @entity4 five times already in a highly decorated career but he remains unhappy and even said he can not achieve financial security through snooker 's 's * * * ' prize money - an extraordinary claim even for @entity0 , especially as he has already noted : ' i could get by the rest of my life if i never worked again			1
' he said : ' if you go back five or 10 years i used to get good sponsorship for my logos			0
i was on Â£ 350,000 even before i hit a ball			0
now there is no money in snooker			1
the top players are suffering now			1
' i do n't want it to come across as if i 'm doing this for money			2
i just want what 's fair			0
they can say ' you 're getting this amount of prize money '			1
but if you 're a top player it 's f * * * * * * s * * *			2
i want my security , and snooker is n't going to give me that security			1

@entity0 *believes* snooker does not offer him financial security
he claims he now only wants to give snooker ' 20 per cent ' of his time
@entity0 also *criticised* the prize money on offer to top players
