@entity0 believes @entity1 must produce their best performance of the season to secure a place in the last 32 of the @entity5			1
thursday night ’s opponents @entity7 have already qualified from @entity8 and @entity1 spurned a glorious chance to follow suit when they could only draw against minnows @entity11 in @entity12 earlier this month			1
they can , however , progress with a win over a side @entity0 regards as the best pressing team in @entity17 , although he has warned standards must be raised after saturday ’s narrow win over @entity21			1
@entity0 ( right ) has said @entity1 may struggle to sign players in january if they do n't qualify for the last 32 ‘ if we do n’t play well we wo n’t get a result			1
it wo n’t be like the @entity27 , where we can be average and still win , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ that ’s the reality , with no disrespect meant to the other teams			2
‘ but against this calibre of opposition everybody will have to be at it on thursday night			1
without a doubt , it ’ll have to be our best performance of the season			2
‘ they play with a real intensity and lots of energy and pace			2
they ’re a really fit team who obviously do a lot of good work on the training pitch			2
that ’s where performances come from			2
‘ they ’ve a new coach but it ’s the same principles			2
they ’ve got the potential to be in the latter stages			0
‘ they do n’t have “ great ” names as individual players but they are a team			1
everyone knows their jobs and they work hard together from the first minute to the last			0
’ @entity0 talks to @entity1 and @entity65 captain @entity64 during a training session @entity68 defender @entity67 remains a doubt after sustaining a kick to his ankle which saw replaced against @entity21			1
that is a concern and @entity0 added : ‘ we want our strongest defence available			1
@entity7 are a very good team			1
i watched their game from the weekend again on monday night			0
they ’re probably the best pressing team in @entity17			0
‘ they do n’t give you a minute on the ball , so it ’s going to be completely different to what we ’re used to in the @entity86 , where teams sit off us			0
they just keep pressing you so our players will have to be on their toes and move the ball quickly			1
‘ if you dwell on the ball against teams like that they ’ll take it off you in dangerous positions			0
‘ it should be a great game for us and that ’s what we want — to learn and develop and keep stretching ourselves			0
we know we ’re going to have to have a top performance to get a result			0
an average performance wo n’t get a result			0
’ defender @entity67 said he believes @entity1 could reach the semi-final or even final of the @entity5 failure on thursday would mean a nervy night in @entity109 against @entity110 in the final group game in two weeks ’ time although @entity1 can lose tomorrow and still advance if @entity11 beat @entity110			1
@entity0 is keen to take care of business with a game in hand however and added : ‘ that would be the ideal scenario and that ’s the objective on thursday night			1
can we get the job done ? ‘ then we could look forward to the last game in the group with no pressure			2
’ @entity0 meantime dismissed talk linking him as a potential successor for outgoing @entity124 performance director @entity123 and insisted he is happy with his current job			1
‘ it ’s nice of @entity123 to say that — but i ’m the @entity1 assistant manager , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’m very happy here and it would n’t interest me at this stage			0
’ @entity1 could qualify from their @entity5 group when they take on @entity7 on thursday @entity0 is an advocate of the @entity124 ’s performance schools strategy implemented by @entity123			1
the @entity135 ’s abrasive style did not win wholesale approval , but the former @entity65 international says the nationality of the new man is less important than his ability to deliver results			0
‘ i do n’t think nationality matters at all			0
it ’s about whoever is best for the job , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s about quality , not nationality			0
‘ it ’s an important role , a very important role			0
you need to have someone overseeing it and pushing things on			0
it keeps everyone on their toes if they know they are being assessed			0
‘ when someone knows they are n’t being assessed then people can get complacent			0
there ’s no - one springs to mind for me , but i ’m sure they ’ll be scouring the country and @entity17			0
it has to be a football person , 100 per cent without a doubt			2

@entity1 could qualify from their @entity5 group on thursday
