october is @entity0 , which means the @entity2 campaign is soon to return			1
# @entity2 is being led by @entity3 and @entity4 to raise money and awareness for breast cancer – the @entity9 ’s most common cancer , with one in eight women affected by the disease during their lifetime			1
the campaign is asking women to ditch the cosmetics and go bare - faced in october - whether it 's for the whole month , a week or just a day			1
it 's an easy thing to do to raise funds for such a worthy cause			1
full details on how you can take part will be revealed very soon , but for now i thought i ’d share some skincare tips for those of you who may be more reluctant to # @entity37			1
as a self - confessed beauty junkie , i admit giving up make - up is quite a daunting prospect			2
however , following the right skincare regime will give you the confidence you need to let your natural radiance shine through without the need for cover - up			2
here are some of the key products i ’ll be using while i # @entity2 this october : @entity17 dared to bare last year and plans to forsake make - up for the whole of october this year the @entity50 : my # @entity51 1 – cleanse in preparation for going bare - faced , i ’ve been cleansing my skin with the @entity55 twice a day			1
the soft , foamy formulation feels super fresh and soothing on the skin , plus it ’s completely soap free meaning it does n't irritate my sensitive skin at all			2
for breakout prone skin , i highly recommend the @entity62 3 clarifying @entity61			2
whether you ’re 13 or 30 and suffer from blemishes , this kaolin - based cleanser banishes the build up of sebum , dead skin cells and bacteria , leaving skin looking clear and feeling purified			2
2 – tone @entity72 is a product many people think it ’s fine to omit from their skincare regime , but i ca n’t stress enough how important it is to use a toner daily to ensure your skin stays supple and keep your pores tight			0
@entity17 usually opts for high glamour make - up looks so going cosmetics free will be quite the challenge one of my current favourites is the @entity72			1
my skin can get quite dry sometimes , particularly in the colder months , and the gentle yet effective formula of this toner leaves it feeling hydrated and refreshed			0
if you have larger , more troublesome pores , i would suggest the @entity92			0
its powerful formula – made with blemish - busting salicylic acid – both unclogs and tightens pores for a more even , matte complexion you ’ll be confident to bare			0
3 – @entity99 my moisturiser of choice while i # @entity102 in october is looking likely to be the @entity103			1
perfect for dry or sensitive skins , the formula drenches dehydrated skin with long - lasting moisture without leaving it looking or feeling greasy			0
if you 're an oily - skinned gal , the @entity109 will change your life ! its lightweight , gel - like formulation immediately mattifies the skin and leaves it looking fresh			0
the fluid also treats shiny skin from the very core , by regulating sebum production and preventing pores from getting blocked			0
bye - bye shine , hello flawless skin ! @entity17 says that if you are going cosmetic free you can still make your face look fresh with cleansers 4 – exfoliate ensure your bare - faced skin is the most radiant and beautiful it can be by exfoliating once or twice a week			1
there are a whole host of facial exfoliators around for even the most sensitive of skins , so select your weapon wisely and you ’ll reap a world of benefits without having to worry about your skin becoming irritated			0
i ’ve been loving the @entity136 recently			0
it gently buffs away impurities and dead cells on the skin ’s surface , leaving you with a radiant , glowing complexion			0
the gorgeous macadamia and rosehip scent mean it ’s a real treat to use , too , making this scrub a definite # @entity37 staple for me			2
for skin that ’s prone to oiliness and blemishes , try the @entity151			0
it controls oil - secretion and reduces shine while offering a deep cleanse to the complexion , leaving skin feeling soft and fresh			0
while i # @entity2 i ’ll also be treating myself to a few relaxing @entity159 facials in order to keep my skin looking as fresh and radiant as it can while i go sans make - up			1
do n’t forget your eyes – if you ’re planning to # @entity102 like me in october , make sure your peepers look bright and healthy by using an under eye gel like @entity168 to banish puffiness and dark circles			1
finally , use a good quality lip balm every day to combat chapped lips			0
my ultimate favourite is the @entity174 – slather a layer of this gorgeous honey - scented , creamy balm over your lips at night and you ’ll be guaranteed to wake up with a super-soft , kissable pout			0
so whether you ’re planning to go bare - faced for a day , a week , or the whole month of october , get your skin ready with your own # @entity2 prep kit - all the products i ’ve recommended are available at @entity187			1
until next time , @entity17 xxx			1
