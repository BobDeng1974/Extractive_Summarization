by @entity0 poverty , drugs and alcohol may seem like the obvious causes of crime - but some scientists believe we should add lead to the list			2
for a number of years , researchers have been stating that the presence of toxic lead in the environment can damage a child ’s brain , making them more likely to be violent later in life			1
they claim that lead could be a factor in explaining the dramatic surge in crime in @entity21 and @entity22 in the late 80s , which peaked in 1993 – and the fall in crime in recent years			2
for a number of years , researchers have been stating that the presence of toxic lead in the environment can damage a child ¿ s brain making them more likely to be violent later in life			1
when the amount of lead in the environment increased , this graph shows a corresponding rise in violent crime two decades later in a @entity39 radio 4 programme last night , @entity37 revisited the theory by looking at how crime rose from the mid- 20th century before peaking in the early 90s and then falling back sharply			1
previous explanations for this change include decline in the use of crack cocaine , the rise of zero - tolerance policing and even the legalisation of abortion			0
but in the early 1990s , @entity51 economist and housing consultant @entity50 calculated the rise and fall of the presence of lead from petrol and he compared that curve to the modern history of violent crime			1
when the amount of lead in the environment increased , mr @entity50 showed a corresponding rise in violent crime two decades later			1
when the amount of lead in the environment fell , violent crime reduced about 20 years later			1
in @entity65 , males ages 12 - 14 in 1958 , born as leaded gas use rose after @entity66 , had higher index crime ' caution and conviction ' rates than older teens born before that rise in lead exposure @entity75 lead was used in early model cars to improve performance and reduce wear			1
due to concerns over health risks , this type of petrol was slowly phased in the 1970s			0
today , the most common way young children are exposed to lead is though contaminated household dust , ingested via normal hand - to - mouth activity as they crawl			2
heavily - leaded circa - 1900 paint can deteriorate by ' chalking ' , causing lead dust hazards , and lead - contaminated dust from lead paint in older homes			0
the leaded share of @entity51 paint fell from nearly 100 per cent in 1900 to 35 per cent by the 1930s , but the the country did n’t ban lead paint until 1978			0
lead - based paint in the @entity65 was banned from sale to the general public in 1992 , apart from for specialist use			0
lead can be absorbed into bones , teeth and blood and be devastating to the human body , inhibiting oxygen and calcium transport as well as altering nerve transmission in the brain			0
studies in the 1970s revealed that even low concentrations of lead in children can cause permanent damage including reduced iq , learning disabilities , aggressive behaviour and shortened attention span			1
lead - based paint in the @entity65 was banned from sale to the general public in 1992 , apart from for specialist use			0
many cities in the @entity51 removed lead from petrol in the mid- 1970s and from paint a decade earlier			0
at the same time violent crime began to fall in the 1990s and has continued to fall since			1
since then , the data for the lead theorists has become more detailed			2
separate studies found a statistical correlation between lead levels and violence in @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and other @entity51 cities			0
today , the most common way young children are exposed to lead is though contaminated household dust , ingested via normal hand - to - mouth activity as they crawl			0
heavily - leaded circa - 1900 paint can deteriorate by ' chalking ' , causing lead dust hazards , and lead - contaminated dust from lead paint in older homes researchers took other causes such as social , economic and legal factors into account , including drug use , poverty , policing effort and incarceration rates			0
mr @entity50 told the @entity155 : ' my 2007 study shows the same relationship between lead exposure and both property crime and violent crime trends in the @entity51 , @entity162 , @entity65 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , and @entity168			1
' across all nine nations , the statistical best - fit time - lag for the impact of lead exposure was 18 years for property crime , 23 years for violent crime , and 19 years for overall index crime			1
' the time lags are the same within each nation even though the rise and fall of gasoline lead occurred at different times in different nations			0
' @entity75 lead was used in early model cars to improve performance and reduce wear			0
due to concerns over health risks , this type of petrol was slowly phased in the 1970s professor @entity189 , of @entity190 in @entity191 , who has studied the effect of lead on children , said there was a ‘ strong association ’ between criminal activity and lead in different parts of the city			1
he added that police were even using the data on lead to target specific areas of @entity191 where they expected crime to be higher			1
this would allow them to focus resources at particular crime hot spots where lead poisoning had been higher in the past			2
dr @entity212 told the @entity39 that the data now suggests that lead could account for as much as 90 per cent of the changing crime rate during the @entity215 across all of the world			2
but the @entity39 notes that this only remains a theory because nobody could ever deliberately poison thousands of children to see whether they became criminals later in life .			0

global studies show when the amount of lead in an environment increased , there was a corresponding rise in violent crime two decades later
even low concentrations of lead in children can cause permanent damage including reduced iq , learning disabilities , aggressive behaviour
police have been known to use the data on lead to target specific areas of @entity191 where they expected crime to be higher
