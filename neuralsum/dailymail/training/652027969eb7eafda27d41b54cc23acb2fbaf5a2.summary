@entity0 will successfully realise his dream of playing in the @entity2 – at least that ’s what @entity4 - winner @entity3 believes			1
the @entity6 running back , who is preparing for sunday 's game at @entity10 against the @entity11 , was asked about the prospect of his club signing the 26 - year - old @entity14			1
@entity3 , 29 , met @entity0 while he was visiting @entity14 and watched him play in the @entity15			1
he describes the fullback as a ‘ good athlete ’			0
@entity3 , who landed in @entity18 with the @entity6 on tuesday , spoke highly of @entity0 ' i have not had a chance to speak to him recently , but when i did when i was in @entity14			1
i spoke with him quite a bit about playing in the @entity2 and he seemed very excited about the opportunity			2
' the former @entity23 , who previously dated @entity25 , said he spoke to @entity0 about switching sports : ' i just told him : " if you really want to do this than you should definitely go for it "			2
i just talked about , i ’ll give an example of when i was in @entity32 , there was an opportunity for me to either stay in @entity32 or get traded to @entity34 and i took that opportunity , that leap of faith to go to a different team and prove that i could be an every down back			0
i told him the same thing for him , ‘ if you feel like you ’ll never forgive yourself for not taking this opportunity than you should definitely go			0
' asked if he talked to any team - mate about @entity0 , @entity3 continued : ' i spoke to @entity42 ( @entity43 ) about him and some of the running backs about him			1
we actually watched some of his highlight films and he ’s a really good player			0
i got a chance to watch him play in @entity14 against the @entity15			1
like i said , he ’s a great player , he ’s fast , he ’s big , he ’s strong and has everything it takes to play in this league			0
' @entity53 hopes to swap the @entity54 for the @entity2 @entity0 , who announced he was leaving the @entity54 during a tearful press conference and flew to @entity56 on sunday night , already is rumoured to have at least six teams interested in his services			1
the @entity6 , who have previously employed @entity61 placekicker @entity60 , are believed to be one of the teams considering making a bid for @entity0			1
team president @entity65 was non-commital about the @entity14 , saying : ' we look at a lot of players and i ’ll let @entity71 ( @entity70 ) comment on more specifics , but we ’ll look at a lot of different guys in a lot of different areas			2
we ’re always looking to make the team better			0
' when he was asked earlier this week about the prospect of his team signing the former @entity81 , @entity6 head coach @entity78 said : ‘ i ca n’t tell you much about that			2
i mean , i know who he is , obviously , but i do n’t know what i ’m supposed to tell you			0
i have no knowledge of it in that regard			0
’ the @entity6 ( 5 - 2 ) have had issues at running back this year as @entity3 and backups @entity43 and @entity93 have all missed time with injuries , so @entity78 said it was possible @entity6 ’s front office was looking at @entity0			1
‘ it could be a personnel issue , but i ’m not aware of it			0
besides that , our focus is pretty narrow this time of the year , so getting out of that realm , it ’s hard to do			0
obviously , there are a lot of good athletes around this country , and there are a bunch of them playing other sports , you know , basketball , baseball , rugby , which is similar to our sport , and there is a lot of carryover			0
so , we ’ll see ’ the reigning @entity4 champion @entity119 have been linked to @entity0 , as have the @entity121 of the @entity122			2
rockers @entity124 and @entity125 of the legendary group of the same name are owners of the @entity121			0
if @entity0 avoids @entity121 and the @entity122 and is able to make it in @entity130 , it wo n’t be because @entity3 has spoken to team management on his behalf - at least not yet			1
‘ i did n't say anything directly to them about him , but i spoke to some of my team - mates about him and just showed them some of his highlights , ’ @entity3 said			2
‘ he 's a great athlete and i told him i definitely think he has a future in the @entity2 if he 's serious about it			0
’ just because @entity3 has kept mum about @entity0 does n’t mean the @entity6 potential interest in the @entity14 import has gone unnoticed			1
a @entity144 construction company posted a @entity146 poll on wednesday morning asking if @entity6 fans would want the team to sign @entity0 , suspended running back @entity149 or simply stand pat. it drew a number of responses , although many of them were bashing former @entity155 and admitted domestic abuser @entity149			1
the story of @entity0 making it in the @entity2 would be a much more positive one , especially because other rugby players have been somewhat unsuccessful in the past			1
@entity14 @entity162 , now of a member of @entity164 caught a single pass in five games with the @entity167 as a tight end in 2012			0
@entity170 @entity169 , formerly of the @entity171 , previously attempted to make the @entity6 but was cut earlier this year .			2

@entity6 running back says @entity175 star possesses ' all the skill sets '
@entity0 announced last week he was leaving the @entity54 for the @entity2
lions are one of six teams rumoured to be interested in the 26 - year - old
@entity3 met @entity0 during a *summer* trip to @entity14 and has watched him play
