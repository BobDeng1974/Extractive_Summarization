@entity1 , who served as both @entity2 and @entity3 under @entity5 , has been handed the job as the corporation ’s strategy chief			1
mps claimed it was ‘ unprecedented ’ to have someone with such a politically active past become a senior @entity7 executive , while others said having a ‘ partisan political figure ’ would do little to reassure people that the corporation is impartial			1
even insiders admitted it did little to dispel the impression there was ‘ a revolving door between the @entity16 and the @entity7 ’			1
eyebrows were also raised over the fact that there was no open recruitment process for mr @entity1 ’s job			1
sources at the @entity7 claimed there was no point in such a costly exercise because he was viewed as the ideal candidate for the newly - created job			2
it is understood no fees were paid for recruitment consultants			0
mr @entity1 will receive £ 295,000 to be the corporation ’s director of strategy and digital when he joins next month			2
he will be a key figure in the @entity7 ’s charter renewal negotiations over the next few years , but has also been given a role which puts him in charge of communications , policy , public affairs , marketing and audiences			1
it will make him one of the corporation ’s best paid and most powerful executives			1
mr @entity1 quit @entity64 in 2010 and is currently a senior producer at production company @entity66 as well as an adviser to the @entity68			2
mps warned he would have to make it clear he had put his ‘ @entity10 affiliations ’ well behind him			0
@entity72 , @entity73 mp for @entity74 , who sits on the @entity75 , said he had an ‘ intrinsic nervousness ’ about the appointment			0
he said : ‘ there is sometimes an agenda within the @entity7 that is left - leaning			2
@entity1 is to return to the @entity7 under incoming director general @entity80 , pictured ' the @entity7 does not just need to be impartial , it needs to be seen to be impartial , and it is hard to see how it is impartial when it has just appointed a former @entity10 cabinet minister to head up its public affairs programme			1
’ @entity86 , chairman of the committee , added : ‘ i recognise that @entity1 is a bright guy with a lot of experience			2
‘ but it is unprecedented to have someone in a management role that has been quite as politically active and he will have to make it clear he has left his @entity10 affiliations behind him			0
’ another member of the committee , @entity73 @entity98 , described the move as ‘ provocative ’ and ‘ totally unacceptable ’ in the light of previous accusations of left - wing bias against the @entity7			2
one senior @entity7 boss said : ‘ he is probably very capable			2
but having a former secretary of state working on charter renewal is a bit weird			1
’ they added that his appointment would add to the impression that there was a ‘ revolving door between the @entity16 and the @entity7 ’			0
insiders admitted that mr @entity1 's appointment did little to dispel the impression there was ' a revolving door between the @entity16 and the @entity7 ' yesterday the corporation said that mr @entity1 had stepped down from his membership of the @entity10			1

it ’s a special and important place			0
’ the @entity7 said that his deal would not represent an increase to the senior management pay bill			0
savings are likely to be made as other executives lose their jobs in the restructure which accompanies mr @entity1 ’s appointment			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it is perfectly possible for an individual to work at the @entity7 without allowing their personal views to impact on their job and the @entity7 has strong guidelines on potential conflicts of interest that may be caused by political activity			0
