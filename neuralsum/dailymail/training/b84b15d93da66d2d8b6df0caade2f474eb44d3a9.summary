next time you 're in a bad mood , do n’t turn to @entity3 to cheer you up			1
research has revealed that the longer you spend procrastinating on the social networking site , the more miserable you will become			2
this is because we recognise we 're wasting our time on the site , and this lowers our self - esteem			0
researchers from @entity12 in @entity13 asked 300 @entity15 and @entity16 @entity3 users to take a series of tests			1
the first asked how much time they had spent on @entity3 , and to rate their mood			1
the second asked some participants to spend 20 minutes on the social network the research contradicts @entity3 ’s own controversial study , published last month , which revealed posts on the site can have a positive and negative effect			1
@entity30 researchers from @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity30 studied the profiles of 608 female @entity3 users			1
according to the researchers , ‘ half ( 308 ) were categorised as “ connected ” and the remaining 308 users were categorised as “ lonely ” ; based on clearly stating this feeling in their latest wall posting			2
’ the study then monitored the publicly available aspects of the profile to see if there was a relationship between loneliness and self - disclosure			0
half of those who were categorised as lonely were more likely to include more personal information on their accounts			0
this ranged from their relationship status to their address and phone number			0
one in eight lonely users also listed their favourite book and film			0
for the more recent experiment , a total of 300 @entity15 and @entity16 - speaking participants were asked by researchers from the @entity12 to take two tests to see how @entity3 affected their mood			1
in the first , they were asked how much time they had spent on @entity3 that day , before being asked to rate their mood			1
the second study asked some of the participants to spend 20 minutes on @entity3 doing typical things such as checking their news feed and updating their status			1
a second group browsed the web , but did not use social networks , while a third was given no instructions			0
all three groups were asked to rate how ‘ meaningful ’ their overall experience had been			0
the findings revealed that in both experiments , people said they felt worse about themselves after using @entity3 , because they did not feel it was a good use of their time			1
lead researcher @entity90 of the @entity12 in @entity13 said : ‘ the meaningfulness actually accounts for the mood effects			0
a second group browsed the web , but not social networks , while a third was given no instructions			0
the findings revealed that all participants said they felt worse about themselves after using @entity3 because they did not feel it was a good use of their time ‘ it ’s not surprising that if you do something you do n’t consider very meaningful , you ’re not in a good mood afterward			1
’ previous studies have found @entity3 can make people feel more jealous and lonely			2
@entity30 researchers from @entity32 in @entity33 discovered that female @entity3 users who are categorised as lonely are more likely to include more personal information on their accounts			2
this ranged from their relationship status , to their address and phone number , while one in eight lonely users also listed their favourite book and film			0
@entity3 ’s own study was heavily criticised when it emerged the company manipulated the news feeds of 700,000 people in 2012 to see what would happen - without telling them first .			2

researchers asked 300 @entity3 users to *undertake* *online* tests
the first asked participants to reveal how much time they spend on @entity3 , before asking them to rate their mood
the second asked participants to spend 20 minutes on the social network
