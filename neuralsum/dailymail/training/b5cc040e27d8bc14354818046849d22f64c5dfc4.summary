the @entity10 software can process up to 2,000 tweets a second and boil each one down to eight basic emotions : anger , disgust , fear , happiness , surprise , sadness , shame and confusion			1
designers said it could be used on a mass scale to evaluate crowd emotions , alert police to potential criminals or public safety threats , and even guide national policy on dealing with major incidents			1
they said it could be used to create a geographical map of the national mood			2
while it currently focuses on the @entity34 , it could be expanded to monitor the 10,000 tweets that are sent out every second worldwide from @entity37 's hundreds of millions of users			2
academics said they were also exploring ways of creating personality profiles from the language individuals used on @entity37 and similar social streams			1
together with @entity44 and @entity45 , @entity37 has proved a useful aid to rioters , such as those involved in the violent attacks that swept @entity50 - and particularly @entity51 - in the summer of 2011			1
@entity37 already groups and flags up ' trends ' on the site - topics that many users are tweeting about at a given time			0
professor @entity58 , who led the team from @entity60 who developed the programme , said : ' following the murder of soldier @entity64 in @entity65 there was an outpouring of sadness and disgust through @entity37			0
emotions : @entity37 was a major organisational aid for people involved in riots in @entity51 in august 2011 ' across the country people expressed their emotions at this unprovoked attack , with some using the incident to incite racial hatred against @entity79			1
' two days after his murder his family appealed for calm , stating that their son would not have wanted his name to be used as an excuse to carry out attacks against others			0
' this appeal had an almost immediate effect , leading to an outpour of positive sentiment			0
' he said that public postings through social media give an accurate real - time record of how and what people are feeling			0
' @entity37 is a very concise platform through which users express how they feel about a particular event , be that a criminal act , a new government policy or even a change in the weather , ' he said			0
' through the computer program we have created we can collate these expressions of feelings in real time , map them geographically and track how they develop			0
' dr @entity113 , who was part of the research team that created the structural model used by @entity10 , said : ' the ontology ( structural model ) we created takes the eight emotions and gives them a rich linguistic context so that we can chart the strength of emotions expressed in ordinary language and also in slang			2
for any incident we can view how reactions grow and diminish over time			0
' @entity130 mood : the @entity10 software is said to provide a geographical map of social network users ' emotions the team has already secured further funding that will enable researchers to develop another prototype system that can automatically detect events , analyse emotions and extract more summary details from social media			1
the emotive project was funded by the @entity144 and the @entity145 .			2
