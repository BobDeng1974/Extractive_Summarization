by @entity0 she was born weighing just 1lb and shorter than the length of a toothbrush			1
but baby @entity3 - given just a 10 per cent chance of survival - has gone on made a miraculous recovery			1
arriving just 27 weeks into her mother 's pregnancy last august , doctors feared she was unlikely to survive			2
miracle : @entity3 - pictured here aged two months in the first picture her parents took of her - was born weighing just 1lb and shorter than the length of a toothbrush			1
she was given just a 10 per cent chance of survival after she was born just 27 weeks into her mother 's pregnancy @entity3 's mother @entity19 suffered from pre-eclampsia during her pregnancy			1
the condition can cause a premature birth and low birth weight her mother @entity19 had pre-eclampsia - high blood pressure and protein in in the urine during pregnancy			2
the condition can cause fits ( eclampsia ) and other complications , as well as low birth weight and premature birth for the baby			0
as a result , mrs @entity3 had to be admitted to hospital more than three months before she was due to give birth			1
@entity3 was born by @entity40 but was so ill she was immediately taken to the critical care unit before her parents could even meet her			1
' she was absolutely tiny			0
it was ridiculous , ' her mother said			0
' the nurses said she was the smallest baby they ’d ever seen born at 27 weeks			2
mrs @entity3 , 45 , said : ' it was terrifying knowing that our daughter was so tiny and so ill that we would n’t even be able to see her until she was a day old			1
after an agonising day 's wait , they were allowed to see her the next day			0
survivor : @entity3 ( with father @entity51 , right ) will soon celebrate her first birthday and is making good progress she was so tiny that her father @entity51 's wedding ring fitted over her foot and all the way up to her thigh			1
and a toothbrush placed next to her was longer than her body			0
' she had tubes everywhere and was on a breathing apparatus - we were told to take it hour by hour , ' said mrs @entity3			1
premature babies born before their mothers are 27 weeks pregnant are more likely to survive than ever before , according to research published in the @entity68			2
however , the proportion of premature babies who experience serious health problems has remained ' largely unchanged '			0
while the pre-term survival rate continues to rise , the number of long - term disabilities , such as learning difficulties and cerebral palsy , will rise , the researchers warned			0
fearing @entity3 may not survive , doctors offered mrs @entity3 the chance to take a picture of her baby daughter			1
but she refused - insisting @entity3 would pull through			2
by the time she was two months old , her daughter had survived heart surgery and was finally longer than the toothbrush			2
' after @entity3 came off the breathing apparatus she made really good progress , ' her mother said			1
' she had her brain scanned every week and her hearing and sight tested , but so far everything is fine			0
' and after 101 days in hospital , she had recovered enough to join her four sisters at home in @entity96			1
' everyone was hoping and praying that she ’d be ok but i knew she was a little fighter and she ’d make it through			0
' now she ’s at home it 's crazy to think how small she was			0
she 's such a smiley and placid baby and such a giggler			0
she ’s always laughing at her sisters			0
' i just did n’t know how we were ever going to get through this so the fact that she ’s doing absolutely perfectly is incredible			0
