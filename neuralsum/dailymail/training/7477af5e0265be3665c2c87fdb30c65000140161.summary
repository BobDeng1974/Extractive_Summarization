by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 12:14 est , 18 june 2013 polygamy might be illegal in @entity2 but that has n't stopped @entity4 , 53 , dubbed the ' rampant rabbi ' , from pursuing his unusual take on family life			1
with him , on his @entity9 farm , live his five wives , their 18 children and , overseeing it all , @entity4 's mother - in - law , @entity13			1
@entity4 , who is known for his controversial views - among them ' all women need a husband ' , ' some gay people have demons in them ' and ' black people have low self - worth ' - looks set to raise a few more eyebrows when a documentary that focuses on the life of his 10 - year - old daughter @entity24 is screened this week			1
she even has nicknames for her mothers			2
@entity43 , 53 , is known as ' @entity44 ' , while her biological mother @entity45 , 42 , is referred to as ' @entity46 ' because she looks after the family 's horses			1
' @entity49 had a vision and @entity51 told him to have seven wives , ' explains fresh - faced @entity24			2
' i could n't bear not living with all my mummies			2
' although he refers to them as ' wives ' , @entity4 is not technically married to any of the women but they have all taken vows and do wear wedding rings			1
@entity4 's unusual family began after he separated from his legal wife 15 years ago			1
he began a relationship with @entity43 , and shortly after , came his heavenly vision			2
his harem swiftly expanded to include his former nanny , @entity66 , plus @entity67 , 41 , @entity38 , 54 , @entity68 , 67 , @entity69 , 45 and @entity70 , 32			0
between them , they have 18 children with @entity4 , all of whom live according to his often bizarre decisions			1
close : @entity24 has a loving relationship with her mothers including @entity43 ( second left ) and @entity45 ( far right ) @entity49 's girl : @entity24 describes father @entity4 as ' awesome ' and says she could be a polygamous wife one that is likely to prove particularly controversial was his decision to take the three - month - old @entity24 from her mother , @entity45 , and hand her to @entity43 to raise			1
' when i was three months old , daddy decided that @entity43 should look after me instead of @entity45 , ' says @entity24			0
when asked why by documentary makers , @entity45 says : ' it was clear that i did n't have the ability to look after you			0
@entity43 stepped in and that was a good thing			0
it 's made me better in lots of ways			0
' as she finishes speaking , her lip quivers and she promptly bursts into tears			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , has his own controversial take on the issue			1
' @entity45 had a very strong anti-men attitude and it was so strong that it was in @entity101 , ' he says			0
' @entity24 did not like me and rejected me			0
' the witchcraft of women annihilates children 's love and respect for their fathers			2
' although @entity4 's domineering behaviour has already led to ' wives ' @entity69 and @entity70 leaving the family , it has made no impression on his daughter , who describes him as ' awesome '			1
@entity24 can even see herself replicating the unusual set - up when she grows up			0
' i 've told my dad that in my future i would n't mind having a man with seven wives , ' she says			2
' i 've grown up like that			0
' the girl with @entity120 is on thursday at 9pm on @entity121			0

@entity4 , 53 , had seven wives although two have now left
between them , his wives have given birth to a brood of 18 children
the family live on a farm in @entity9 where they raise horses
