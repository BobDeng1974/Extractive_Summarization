by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 5 june 2013 a 91 - year - old woman was left lying in her home for two days after she suffered a stroke while on the phone to an out - of - hours gp service who failed to help her			1
@entity7 , 91 , known as @entity8 , collapsed while on the phone to an out - of - hours medic about a cut on her leg			1
she had called the service after cutting her leg on a thorn while gardening but suffered the stroke while talking to the representative of an out - of - hours firm			2
@entity17 ( pictured , right , before her stroke with niece @entity19 ) was left lying in her home for two days after she suffered a stroke while speaking to an out - of - hours medic on the phone a member of staff from the not - for - profit @entity26 ( @entity25 ) @entity24 visited her home in @entity29 , @entity30 , but left after ms @entity7 failed to answer the door			1
the elderly lady was unable to shout for help as a result of the stroke and was left lying on the floor of her home for two days before relatives raised the alarm			1
police managed to gain access to her home through an unlocked back door and an ambulance rushed her to the @entity43 in @entity30			0
the stroke left the retired @entity46 teacher unable to swallow and she had to be fed via a tube in hospital following the incident in june 2011			0
after being moved to @entity50 , in @entity30 , she stayed for three months and underwent physiotherapy after she recovered from pneumonia , and eventually she recovered her speech			0
ms @entity7 's family have now launched legal action against the out - of - hours service			1
her niece , @entity57 said : ' unfortunately the representative from the out - of - hours service did not attempt to call the police or investigate the back of the property			2
' if he had done this , he would have discovered that the back door was open and quickly realised that something was wrong			0
ms @entity7 ( pictured in may this year after her stoke ) was left unable to speak and needed to be tube - fed immediately after her stroke			2
her family are now taking legal action against @entity26 ' this could have made a significant difference to @entity8 who was lying paralysed due to the effects of the stroke and could not call for help			1
' unfortunately @entity8 lost a lot of vital time when she first suffered the stroke and the subsequent pneumonia also delayed how much the hospital team could do to help her recovery			0
' if she had been found the day it occurred there may have been a significant difference in her experience and long term outcome			0
' ms @entity7 , who had lived independently in her home for 50 years before the stroke , now needs round - the - clock care and lives in a nursing home in @entity91			2
her left side is completely paralysed and she has not been able to walk or stand since the stroke			1
she has been bed - bound since november 2012			2
a spokesman for @entity25 said : ' this is a sad and difficult case for all those involved and we take this matter very seriously			0
it would be inappropriate for us to comment further whilst the claim is ongoing			0
' @entity101 of @entity102 and the solicitor representing mrs @entity7 's , said : ' the elderly can be an incredibly vulnerable group when trying to access out - of - hours medical care			1
this case highlights the dangers of not adequately providing these services			0

@entity7 collapsed while on the phone to an out - of - hours medic
a staff member from @entity26 visited her house but left when the paralysed mrs @entity7 did not answer the door
the effects of the stroke meant that she was unable to call for help
was not found until her family raised the alarm and police visited her home
the delay in *treatment* meant the effects of the stroke could not be *reversed*
her left side is now completely paralysed and she is bed - ridden
