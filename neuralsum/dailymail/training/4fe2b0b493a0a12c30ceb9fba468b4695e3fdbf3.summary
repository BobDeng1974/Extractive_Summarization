there was shock when @entity2 – a film that made over $ 300m worldwide – was snubbed at the @entity4 this week			1
@entity5 , the film ’s star , was nominated for @entity7 for her portrayal of @entity9 , who is beautiful , intelligent and seemingly innocent ; until we learn she is actually a ruthless psychopath taking revenge for her husband ’s infidelity by framing her own murder			2
in the famous shower scene at the end of the film , jaws dropped as @entity5 slipped off her dress and revealed an envious body with incredible muscle definition			2
in fact , @entity5 had to undergo four cycles of weight gain and loss to suit the sequence of filming			1
@entity5 is pictured wearing a hot red @entity35 gown to the ceremony sizzling in a slitted strapless @entity35 gown ! check out more @entity35 designs at @entity40 visit site just a few weeks after giving birth , @entity5 shows off an absolutely enviable waist line in a corseted , strapless , slitted @entity35 gown			2
obviously made just for her , this dress shows off her incredible almost unearthly figure ! we are absolutely entranced by the lacework but the most obvious eye catching attribute of this dress is the color			0
@entity55 as roses or rubies , this will certainly make one a head turner if worn			0
being a lady in red is no easy feat so we suggest styling this dress exactly the way @entity5 did : with a simple ballerina 's bun and bare collarbones			2
since we 're not best friends with @entity69 , head designer of @entity35 , we do n't think we 'll be getting a custom made @entity35 gown soon			0
but we found some very suitable substitutes that give us all that wow factor			0
@entity74 at @entity75 visit site @entity78 dress at @entity79 visit site @entity82 long silk dress ( now $ 239 ) visit site @entity85 dress at @entity79 visit site critics were shocked when @entity2 - which made over $ 300 worldwide - received no awards at the @entity4			1
@entity5 is pictured at the premiere of @entity2 ( left ) and at the @entity92 's awards ( right ) in january different weights for different scenes when @entity9 runs off in @entity2 , she packs on a few pounds as part of her disguise , only to return with a killer bob haircut and an even more killer body			1
the film , which was shot out of sequence , required @entity5 to put on almost a stone and a half ( 9kg ) and shed it over and over again so her body was in synch with her character ’s , @entity99 reports			2
it ’s an understatement to say that her trainer , @entity110 ( @entity110 ) fighter @entity28 knows a thing or two about training for muscle gain and weight loss , since fighters constantly have to gain or lose weight rapidly to stay in a particular weight class			1
@entity5 was forced to gain 20 lbs ( 9kg ) in two and a half weeks during @entity2 , and then lose 15 lbs ( 6.8kg ) in ten days			1
she put on the weight through lifting heavy weights and then eating carbs to gain fat in order to lose more than a stone for the final scenes of @entity2 , @entity5 ate only protein , fat and vegetables , as well as carrying out twice daily plyometrics - resistance moves using body weight alkaline water is water with a ph balance of 7 or more - close to the body 's natural 7.3 - 7.4 - and it ’s believed to help reduce inflammation you can buy alkaline drops that make the water more alkaline or add alkalising substances to it such as lemon or baking soda			1
the natural ph of water depends on where you ’re getting it and it tends to range from 6 - 8.5 @entity144 because alkaline water has a higher ph level than plain tap water , proponents say that it can neutralise acid in the bloodstream			0
this apparently boosts metabolism and helps the body absorb nutrients more effectively , it is claimed			0
some even say that alkaline water can help prevent disease and slow the aging process			0
however , researchers have not verified these claims , say doctors at the @entity162			0
some studies suggests that alkaline water may help slow bone loss , but further investigation is needed to determine if this influences overall bone mineral density and if the benefit is maintained over the long term			0
this made @entity173 the perfect person to train @entity5 and keep her at the appropriate weight for filming			1
‘ what i did was employ a lot of the stuff i learned from fighting into the training with @entity5 , ’ ms @entity28 told @entity99 journalist @entity176			1
‘ i know how far you can push the body and i knew how to bulk her up with water weight and later strip it out			0
’ ms @entity28 took @entity5 through four separate training cycles , to gain weight twice and to lose weight twice			1
the two different goals made for two very different diet and exercise regimes			0
when ms @entity28 was hired she had a mere two and a half weeks to help @entity5 gain 20lbs ( 9kg ) , but made sure that there a solid muscle foundation underneath the weight gain			1
‘ i put a lot of lean muscle on her , then some fat on top so when she leaned out she looked really good , ’ ms @entity28 said			2
building muscle she put on 8lbs ( 3.6kg ) of lean muscle , to be exact			0
to get there as fast as possible , ms @entity28 had @entity5 lifting the heaviest weights possible			1
the workout was a basic weight lifting regime : squats , deadlifts , lunges , curls and other simple moves — but @entity5 was maxing out ( that ’s lifting as much as is physically possible for you ) in eight repetitions			2
that built a base of muscle that later became the reason for @entity5 ’s incredible definition in the film ’s ending scenes			2
@entity5 is no stranger to weight loss , showcasing her trim body following the birth of her second son , @entity222 , in december 2014			2
she is pictured while pregnant with @entity222 ( left ) and after giving birth ( right ) , attending the @entity224 in @entity225 @entity5 's personal trainer was @entity28 , a professional fighter			1
ms @entity28 is pictured at an awards ceremony in @entity228 , @entity32 gaining weight for @entity9 ’s chubby scenes ms @entity28 ’s diet for @entity5 ’s weight gain cycle included as much ‘ good fat ’ and protein as she wanted — foods like avocados , almond butter and salmon , and very few carbs			1
ms @entity28 says these fats are necessary for muscle gain and tone because they ‘ feed ’ your muscles the proper nutrients to grow			2
then , a few days before the filming day , @entity5 was allowed to go crazy with carbs and dense foods to put a layer of fat on top of all the hard work she had just done			1
so the next time you ’re watching the movie and @entity9 ’s looking a little chubbier than before , remember there ’s a six pack under there somewhere			0
slimming back down for that shower scene then , before the famous shower scene she had ten days to lose 15 pounds ( 6.8 kg ) both the diet and the workout changed completely - with carbs completely banned			1
‘ that ’s when she was really eating like a fighter , ’ ms @entity28 said			2
she compares the diet for the weight loss cycle to the @entity271 diet : @entity5 ate three meals a day involving a ton of leafy greens and drank alkaline water like it was nobody ’s business			1
the workout consisted of plyometrics ( resistance moves involving jumping using your own body weight ) and high intensity cardio ( and a whole lot of running )			1
every day ’s plyometrics day was different — some days were just upper body , some just lower body , and some days were full - body workouts			1
these workouts involved heart - pumping and toning moves like burpees , mountain climbers , and planks , planks , planks			0
‘ we ’d do five million variations of plank all day every day			0
we ’d do groupings of exercises and the last rotation was always a plank , ’ she said			0
in the week leading up to the shower scene , ms @entity28 was training with @entity5 twice a day			1
the diet and workout regimes sound brutal to say the least			0
it ’s a real testament to how a great attitude can lead you to amazing results			0
@entity5 serves as the perfect example			0
‘ she ’s really very all - in with everything she does			0
once she ’s in , she ’s in , ’ ms @entity28 said .			0
