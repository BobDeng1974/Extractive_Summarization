by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:33 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 19:06 est , 9 december 2013 facing jail : @entity4 subjected his wife to more than two decades of abuse , a court heard yesterday an aristocrat from one of @entity10 ’s grandest families is facing jail after subjecting his wife to more than two decades of domestic abuse			1
@entity4 – a son of the 11th @entity14 – kicked his wife @entity15 and pulled her hair while affected by ‘ drink or drugs or both ’ , a court heard yesterday			1
@entity20 suffered bruising and a dislocated finger during the 22 years of violence			0
the couple , who have two grown - up daughters , are now divorcing after three decades of marriage			0
yesterday @entity27 , 55 , admitted four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm			1
looking gaunt and unshaven , he wore a dark blue suit with a red tie , pocket handkerchief and silver earring as he spoke clearly to plead guilty to the charges			0
@entity4 admitted attacking his wife at the home they shared on the 52,000 - acre @entity39 in @entity40 – home of the world - famous @entity41 – and in @entity43			1
his lawyer @entity44 told @entity45 : ‘ between 1990 and 2011 there were incidents of violence between the two , often in drunk or drugs or both , whereby the complainant received injuries			0
they included scratches and hair pulls			0
’ judge @entity56 , who will sentence the father - of - two in february , told the aristocrat the offences were so serious a prison sentence was possible			0
the estranged couple have not seen each other for a year and divorce proceedings are set to be finalised in the near future			1
he will also consider whether a restraining order to protect @entity27 's wife from her estranged husband should be put in place			1
' at this stage , i am unable to say a custodial sentence would not follow , ' the judge told @entity27			2
' given that this reflects a substantial period of domestic violence , this is a case where i should like the defendant to meet with a probation officer			2
' judge @entity56 said the guilty pleas reflected a ' different picture ' to how @entity27 , referred to simply as @entity82 in court , had described the case during police interview			1
split : @entity27 and his wife @entity15 are pictured on their wedding day at @entity91 in 1982 , left , and at a fancy dress party , right for @entity94 's 50th birthday , right treatment : it is understood that one of the recent alleged incidents left his wife hospitalised luxury : the attacks happened on the sprawling @entity39 in @entity40 where the couple lived ' it does n’t appear to me from having read it that he had quite appreciated the seriousness of the domestic violence in his marriage			1
' as i see it , there has been quite a dramatic period where things should they have been approached differently , might have prevented this violence to the complainant in this case			0
' he admitted a ' deliberate and hard ' kick to his wife at @entity120 on the @entity39 between january 1 2011 and november 29 2011			1
the aristocrat , who has no previous convictions , pleaded guilty to two further assaults , where he bruised his wife in october last year			0
@entity27 also admitted assaulting his wife on numerous occasions between january 1990 and december 2011 , giving her a variety of injuries including a bruise , scratches and pulled hair			1
his guilty plea for that charge , covering a 22 - year period , represented ' incidents of violence between the two , often in drink or drugs or both ' the court heard			1
case : @entity45 heard the incidents of violence between the two often involved drink or drugs appearance : the 55 - year - old was released on conditional bail and will return to court on february 6 @entity145 , @entity146 , said @entity4 ’s wife feared him and was seeking a restraining order			1
' she would say she still has fears of this defendant because of his offending and she is in a very emotional state , ' miss @entity149 said			0
' while she says there has been no real direct contact between the two of them there is evidence that the defendant ’s elder brother , working , so it would seem , on behalf of the defendant ’s father , had contacted the complainant ’s cousin , lord @entity166 , and arranged a meeting in october , during which there was a discussion about finances , dropping the case , paying for advice for the complainant			2
the @entity39 lies in the heart of the @entity40 countryside and is home to the @entity14 and @entity179 of @entity14			1
the @entity14 title was created by @entity181 in 1682 for @entity182 , the 3rd @entity14			2
the family are descendants in the male line from the @entity43 dynasty , the @entity187 , through @entity188 and @entity189 the sprawling estate dates back to the 17th century and is where the game of @entity39 was invented in 1863			1

he is the third of four children of the 11th @entity14 , 85 year - old @entity198 , who is estimated to be worth £ 135 million			1
his eldest brother @entity200 , @entity14 , 60 , is heir to the estate and title			2
' it was this meeting which she found out about and got to hear what was discussed which devastated her and put her under considerable stress in the run up to this trial			0
' miss @entity149 said there was ' nothing to suggest ' @entity27 had been behind the meeting but was the ' sort of conduct ' his wife was ' vulnerable to '			2
representing @entity27 , @entity44 , said his client would not oppose a restraining order			2
' the two have n’t seen each other for over a year , ' he said			0
' lord @entity27 ’s view as far as a restraining order is concerned is that he would be perfectly happy to have such an order imposed			2
' he accepts his marriage is completely over			0
he thinks it by far the best that he have no contact with the complainant , and she has no contact with him			0
' i have no instructions from the @entity14 or his brother			0
' mr @entity234 said divorce proceedings between @entity27 and @entity15 are ' at a stage where hopefully things can be finalised between them '			1
' the children are now at an age where they can make their own way between their parents , ' mr @entity234 said			0
judge @entity56 released @entity27 on conditional bail after advising him to be ' frank with the reality of what has taken place ' during the marriage with the probation service			2
