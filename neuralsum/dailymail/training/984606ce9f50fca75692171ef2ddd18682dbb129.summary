it is any musician 's worst nightmare - feeling the need to sneeze mid-performance			1
and for this poor trombone player , that nightmare became a reality - and ended with rather embarrassing consequences			2
at first , all seems well during the concert - held at @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
and , thinking he can hold it in , the musician powers through - momentarily at least			0
unfortunately , his ambition gets him nowhere - and he sneezes into his instrument , making a loud trumping noise mid-way through the rendition			1
ever professional , the band continue without falling about laughing			0
the man sneezed into his instrument , making a loud trumping noise in the middle of the performance in fact , the conductor barely seems to notice - carrying on without batting and eyelid			1
a video - friendly member of the audience who taped the concert decided to upload the hilarious footage onto @entity41			2
it has now been watched over 650,000 times			0
one @entity41 user noted the man 's sneeze sounded rather like an elephant			2
another , who goes by the name @entity50 , expressed sympathy - writing : ‘ i play trombone , and this has happened to me , too			2
' it ’s almost unavoidable , you never feel it coming			0
’ even the @entity57 has commented , adding : ' we 've all been there : it 's a quiet passage and you really really need to sneeze			0
the video has gone viral - with some internet pranksters using the footage to make a variety of comical films , including this one featuring a startled baby elephant ' try to ignore and keep playing , or disrupt the music to stop and sneeze ? this is what happens when you do n't quite make it ... ﻿ ' unfortunately for the red - faced trombone player , the embarrassment does n't stop there			1
now , internet pranksters have taken it upon themselves to make parody videos of the mortifying accident			0
perhaps taking note of the @entity41 user 's elephant comparison , one video features a pack of the animals walking together			0
and when a baby elephant is startled the man 's sneeze replaces what one can assume was the sound of the animal making a trumping noise .			1
