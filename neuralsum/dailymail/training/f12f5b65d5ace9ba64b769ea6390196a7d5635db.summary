my daughters @entity2 and @entity3 were barely conceived before i found out what sex they were			1
for both , i had private scans at 12 weeks , not only because i wanted to check if they were healthy , but also to find out their gender			2
so by doing so , have i committed the alarming - sounding new crime of ‘ moral kitsch ’ - as author @entity10 would have it – and consigned my daughters to a ghastly ' pink fate ’ ? speaking at the @entity18 at the weekend the @entity14 - winning novelist , who has penned books such as @entity16 and @entity17 , strayed into the subject of discovering a baby 's gender before it is born			1
@entity22 with her daughter @entity3			1
she found out @entity3 's gender at 12 weeks in a bid to mentally prepare for meeting her child while discussing how he decides upon the sex of his characters , according the @entity30 the author said that his son and partner are expecting a child and : ' were absolutely clear that they did not want to know the sex of their child '			1
@entity10 , who has been married twice and has two sons , added : ' it is above all a person			1
knowing in advance this social identity which confers a pink and blue fate almost seems like a form of moral kitsch , because what you are celebrating is a person			1
so i rather take the same view of my characters , if it falls out it is a woman or a man then i go that way			2
' novelist @entity10 bemoaned the trend for parents finding out the sex of their baby before it is even born , at the @entity18 on sunday while i have huge respect for @entity10 , i fear he is confusing fiction and real life here			1
he may be able , as he points out , to swap the genders of the characters in his books at will			1
but creating real families out of flesh and blood does not hang on a writer ’s whim			2
the ‘ is it a boy ? ’ slash ’ is it a girl ? ’ moment may also make for great drama on @entity76 after 26 hours in labour , ending in an emergency c - section , giving birth to my older daughter , @entity2 , the last thing i needed as any more cliff - hangers			2
one of the things that kept me going through those agonising hours was looking forward to meeting the daughter i had already bonded with in the womb			0
so it ’s unfair of @entity10 to paint parents who find out their child ’s sex as conferring them to a simple pink or blue fate			1
there is evidence that both the @entity96 and @entity97 – and no doubt the cave men before them – came up with elaborate techniques to try to guess an infant ’s gender			2
furthermore , being one of two sisters , with no little boys in the family , i was also aware that having a son would be a completely different parenting experience , one i would have to prepare myself for			0
do you agree with @entity10 that finding out the sex of your baby is a form if ' moral kitsch ' ? not because i wanted to stock up with toy trucks and footballs to stereotype him			1
but because brain scans conclusively show that male and female brains develop in different ways , and at different rates , from birth			0
i knew that if i were going to become mother to a son , i would have to find out how			0
nor can i deny that i wanted daughters			0
if nature had decided the opposite , i knew i would have needed time to adjust			0
the second time around there was also the need to get @entity2 , then three , used to the idea that a little sister would be joining the family , not little brother			0
and , of course , into the bargain , we also saved hours of boring debates on boys names and endless old wives ’ guessing games			0
when my girls arrived , i still dressed them in gender neutral white			0
as they have grown up , @entity2 , now 12 , and @entity3 , nine , made their choice about who to become – not me			0
i do not regret my decision to find out their sex for one moment			0
those first months of bonding between mother and baby are so essential there ’s not a moment to waste			2
@entity22 and her daughter @entity3 , now seven , as a baby @entity22 and her daughter @entity154 , now 12 , when she was a baby and right , @entity10 , 65 , who slammed people who discover the sex of their unborn child when my mother gave birth to my younger sister in 1973 , before the days of scans , my father told me that she so wanted a boy , they were worried about how she would bond with her new daughter			1
knowing both my children would be girls before birth gave me a head start i will always be thankful for			0
@entity22 is author of ‘ @entity170 : how to put the @entity171 of your @entity172 in a @entity174 ’ , published by @entity176 / @entity175 , pice 8.99 , this september .			1

novelist @entity10 says finding out sex of baby is ' moral kitsch '
also says it confers a ' blue or pink fate ' on a child before it is born
award - winning author was talking at the @entity18
strayed onto subject when discussing the sex of his characters
parenting expert @entity22 , *47* , found out her babies genders as soon as possible
she hits back *explaining* knowing the gender can be essential
*accuses* @entity10 of mixing up ' fiction with real life '
