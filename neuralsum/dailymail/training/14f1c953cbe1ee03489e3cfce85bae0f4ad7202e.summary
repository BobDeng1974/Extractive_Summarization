risk : millions of adults taking a daily dose of aspirin to ward off heart attacks may be significantly increasing their risk , new research shows millions of adults taking a daily dose of aspirin to ward off heart attacks may be significantly increasing their risk , new research shows			1
nearly a quarter of adults – 23 per cent – have been found to carry a gene which , when combined with the painkiller , makes them nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack			1
it means about one in 100 with the gene who take the drug may suffer from heart problems that could have been prevented , researchers say			0
while past studies have shown taking aspirin can increase the risk of potentially life - threatening internal bleeding , this study , by scientists at @entity22 in the @entity23 , is the first to link dangers from the drug with gene variations			1
dr @entity32 , the report ’s lead author , said : ‘ we need to look at ourselves as individuals , a certain constellation of genes , and to take that into consideration			0
if the research is validated in further study , it would be the logical next step to test everyone for these genes before giving them aspirin			0
’ government figures show there were 30.9 million @entity49 prescriptions for aspirin last year for those at risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
the latest study involved nearly 40,000 women over a ten - year period			2
of those , 23 per cent carried a variation of the catechol - o - methyltransferase gene , which helps the body process stress hormones , linked to heart problems and stroke			2
the research found that those who had the gene were naturally protected and were 34 per cent less likely to have heart attacks			2
however , taking aspirin removed this protection and increased their risk of heart problems by 85 per cent – and , in some cases , by as much as three times			0
in contrast , another group who carried a different variation of the same gene were more likely to have a heart attack than those who did not carry the gene , but aspirin protected against this , cutting the number of heart attacks by 47 per cent			1
study co-author @entity84 , chairman of the @entity85 at @entity86 at @entity87 , said : ‘ rather than give aspirin to all patients with risk factors for heart disease , we need to use modern genomics and genetics to identify those individuals for whom aspirin has the greatest benefit and the lowest risk of adverse effects			2
’ discovery : the @entity22 study found that nearly a quarter of adults - 23 per cent - carry a gene which , when combined with the painkiller , makes them nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack ( file picture ) tests for the genes are not currently available on the @entity49			1
professor @entity108 , associate medical director at the @entity109 , said : ‘ there is a long way to go before personalised medicine is routinely used for people with cardiovascular disease			0
’ previous studies have cast doubt on whether healthy people should take aspirin as the risks could outweigh the benefits			0
they have also found some do not appear to benefit from it , and while the risk of non-fatal heart attacks is reduced by 20 per cent , deaths from strokes and heart failure are not cut			1
anyone prescribed aspirin should continue to take it , experts advised			0
a spokesman for the government ’s medicines watchdog , the @entity134 , said : ‘ as with all medicines we keep them under constant review			0

nearly a quarter of adults - 23 *%* - have been found to carry particular gene
when combined with aspirin , it nearly doubles risk of suffering heart attack
@entity23 study is the first to link dangers from the painkiller with gene variations
