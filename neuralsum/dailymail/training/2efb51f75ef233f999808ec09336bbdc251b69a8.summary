by @entity0 a @entity2 calf named hero has become was is likely the nation 's only double - amputee with prosthetics after a new pair of high - tech devices attached to its back legs			1
hot and tired from a three - hour drive inside a trailer behind a pickup truck , the 600 - pound @entity12 calf was content to lay on the grass behind a south @entity19 building while a team of technicians worked on its hind legs			1
when the calf known as @entity3 heard its name called , the 15 - month - old gingerly got up , unsteadily rocked a bit , then waddled away , tail wagging , eyes wide and tongue licking			2
it headed across a patch of concrete toward an appetizing snack of green shrubbery a few yards away			0
four - legs good ! wearing his new prosthetic legs hero gets a taste of shrubbery in @entity19 luckily talented veterinarians were able to give hero a set of hind legs hero the calf would n't have been alive had it not been for the love and care from those around him ' i 'm so proud , ' @entity3 's caretaker , @entity49 , exclaimed			1
' look at you ! ' it 's the latest step in a year - long effort that has taken @entity54 and the animal from @entity56 , where she rescued it last year from an @entity60 farm where it succumbed to frostbite that claimed its hooves , to @entity64			1
animal surgeons at @entity66 treated hero for several months and affixed the initial prosthetics that the calf now had outgrown			1
' this is our first cow , ' @entity72 , an orthotist and prosthetist for @entity74 , an @entity75 - based national firm that makes prosthetic limbs			1
she was among a team of about eight people working on the project for about two weeks			0
' we did a lot of study of photos and video of cows just regular walking to see what it looks like and see if we can mimic that biomechanically , ' @entity72 said			0
' it 's unusual , yes , but an opportunity			0
' that loving feeling : @entity49 , right , snuggles hero after he was fitted with new prosthetic legs			1
@entity54 rescued the abandoned calf from a @entity56 farm a year ago , brought him to @entity64 and got him permanent prosthetics to replace back hooves that had to be amputated because of frostbite @entity49 says she loves hero more than any other animal she has ever met @entity49 says she is excited for @entity3 to work with handicapped children and wounded veterans because she feels @entity3 will be an inspiration to them surgeons at @entity66 accepted @entity54 's initial pleas for help , removing about two inches of bone to enable them to create a pad of tissue that would allow for prosthetics			1
' until i worked on him , i had n't ever done it before			0
and i 'd not heard of ( prosthetics ) before in a bovine , " said @entity115 , an equine orthopedic surgeon at the school			2
@entity54 figures she has spent nearly $ 40,000 to save the calf			1
' i do n't know how to explain it , ' she said			0
' i 'm an animal rescuer			0
and he had everything against him			0
' @entity3 's hooves are custom made of urethane and titanium , the connecting components are titanium and carbon fiber and the sockets that attach to his legs are carbon fiber and acrylic resin			2
back on his feet : hero is fitted with new prosthetic legs			1
he was found freezing to death in a @entity56 field and is now back on the move hero the calf was discovered with frostbite so severe that he had to have his hind legs amputated @entity54 and @entity72 declined to discuss the cost , but estimated that similar devices for humans go for between $ 4,000 and $ 8,000 apiece			1
@entity3 's sockets are painted with black and white cow spots			2
" @entity152 legs , " @entity72 laughed			0
' we like to customize legs to the person 's personality , ' she said			2

' it makes my day , ' @entity54 said			0
' he 's got a very bright future right now			0
