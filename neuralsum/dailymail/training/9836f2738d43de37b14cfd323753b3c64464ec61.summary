growing population : in this june 2014 photo provided by @entity5 , a humpback whale breaks through the surface of the @entity22 just off a beach on the @entity24 near @entity2 ' one would like to think that some of this has been triggered by an improved environmental ethic , ' @entity9 said			1
' we have the clean air and clean water acts , the @entity29 and associated state laws			0
it 's hard to make the link for sure but there 's certainly been a behavioral change toward the natural environment			0
