by @entity0 it was a one - of - a - kind @entity3 prototype fighter plane , armed with a 45 horsepower engine , a 20 - foot wingspan and a @entity7 gun			1
now , the @entity8 has been brought back to life - 100 years after the war began			2
but while the replica has been built using an original wooden frame , it also includes recycled materials , such as the engine of a @entity15			1
back to life : volunteers @entity17 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) pose with a replica of the @entity8 prototype			1
the aircraft has been built using an original wooden frame and the engine of a @entity15 framework : around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the @entity27 , working from only two photographs and faded plans			1
above , the reproduction 's original wooden framework powering up : mr @entity18 works on the plane 's 500cc twin - opposed engine , featuring twin - opposed cylinders armed : mr @entity17 poses with the aircraft 's @entity7 gun , which was mounted on to the aircraft 's top wing around 60 volunteers helped to restore the plane to its former glory at the @entity27 - working from only two photographs and faded @entity44 plans			1
they created the replica using a wooden frame covered in linen , as well as specifically - made materials , such as the engine cowlings , and recycled materials , including the @entity52 engine			1
@entity53 , manager at the museum in @entity55 , @entity56 , said the Â£ 10,000 restoration project had been ' very exciting '			0
' this is the only plane of its kind in existence			0
it would have disappeared from history if we had n't brought it back to life with this project , ' he said			0
prototype : the @entity8 , featuring a 45 horsepower engine , made its first flight in september 1917 fighter plane : it was designed as a ' high altitude ' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the @entity77			1
however , the one - seater aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production ' it 's been quite tricky as we 've been working from faded plans so it 's important that we 've got people with specific knowledge			1
' it 's also been a very interesting build because it 's so tiny , with a six - metre wingspan and measuring five metres in length			0
weights take - off weight - 266kg empty weight - 154kg dimensions @entity94 - 19ft 12in length - 16ft 7in height - 5ft 2in wing area - 106.02 sq ft performance maximum speed - 94mph ' i 'm glad we 've got it finished in time for the centenary			0
' the @entity8 , which made its first flight on september 1 , 1917 , was designed by the @entity103 on the @entity104			2
established by the @entity106 @entity105 in 1915 , the @entity103 created and tested a range of experimental aircraft - not all of which were flown			0
featuring a 45 horsepower engine , the @entity8 was designed as a ' high altitude ' fighter to tackle the threat posed by the @entity77			1
it was planned to be launched from platforms on battleships , cruisers of even torpedo boats			0
however , the aircraft was eventually deemed too fragile and underpowered to enter production			1
the framework of the replica was crafted in the 1980s , before being abandoned and taken up again four years ago			2
to create it , volunteers sourced the twin - opposed @entity15 engine , which features similar twin - opposed cylinders			2
historic : volunteers used instruments from the national collection archives for the replica 's cockpit ( pictured ) prepared to fire : the @entity7 gun ( pictured ) was a key feature of the original @entity3 fighter plane they then stripped these down to make the equipment light , before removing any ' unnecessary ' parts , such as the cooling fans and starter motor			1
they also managed to acquire a propellor from one of the museum 's local flying clubs			0
however , many of the aircraft 's parts had to be specially crafted , such as the cowlings covering the engine , which have to be made out of spinning aluminum			0
instruments inside the cockpit were acquired from the national collection archives , while the seating and padding around the controls were made with leather			0
a @entity7 gun , mounted on to the top wing of the aircraft , was also designed to measure			1
four years ' work : the replica will be a non-flying exhibit as part of the museum 's @entity170 shows on april 6 mr @entity53 said : ' the @entity8 was to be a disposable , one - operation aircraft - to simply go up , intercept and shoot down the airship , then ditch in the sea			2
' when you work on it , you think this must have been quite a frightening prospect			0
somebody had to get into this tiny aircraft and get up to ten or 15,000 feet with such a small engine , shoot at the huge airship , then crash into the sea and get out as soon as they could			0
' but there were people willing to do it - some very gutsy people			0
' the replica will be a non-flying exhibit as part of the museum 's @entity193 engine running shows on april 6 .			2

@entity8 restored to former glory at @entity27
replica features @entity7 gun , wooden frame and @entity52 engine
