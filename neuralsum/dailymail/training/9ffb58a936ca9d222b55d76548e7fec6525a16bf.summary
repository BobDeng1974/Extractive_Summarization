@entity0 has long been the biggest day of the year over on today , with the morning show team always devoting much time and energy to their costumes , and this year was no different as the anchors got to show off their comedic chops as classic characters from the long running @entity10 variety show @entity11			1
even better , the costume department was able to just run upstairs at @entity13 and grab the same costumes and wigs worn by many of the performers from the actual skits , which provided for some striking likenesses between the actors and anchors			0
from there , the @entity11 credits got reworked , introducing the today team in a manner just like the snl cast , as they hailed cabs , hopped on the subway , and , in the case of @entity44 and @entity45 , guzzled wine			2
the newest kids on the block , @entity26 and @entity27 , gave @entity76 's take on the very spirited @entity29 cheerleaders , complete with a cheer and some carefully choreographed moves to the 90s dance classic that is @entity82 's " @entity81 )			1
" live from @entity58 : the show even did their own version of the @entity11 title credits to kick things off superstar : @entity30 ( above ) got her catholic school girl on as the very theatrical @entity32 , a character made famous by @entity89 , with a little help from @entity31 as a priest @entity93 's debut : @entity30 and @entity31 did good work getting down the look and feel of @entity89 's debut performance as @entity32 in 1995 with guest host @entity98 ( above ) @entity55 and @entity54 they were not , but the two certainly had their moves down			1
and boy were they spirited			0
speaking of spirited , @entity30 proved to have endless energy as she bounded out after @entity26 and @entity27 as the very theatrical and dramatic @entity32			1
joined by a dapper looking @entity31 , forced into the thankless role of playing the largely silent priest , @entity30 jumped , stretched and patted her pits just like @entity89 first did when she debuted the crazy catholic school girl almost 20 years ago			2
wine 's world : the @entity112 loving ladies from the show 's fourth house , @entity45 and @entity44 ( above ) , proved to be pretty excellent drag kings , dressing up as @entity47 and @entity46 , the basement dwelling rockers first played by @entity117 and @entity118 double take : the ladies bore a striking resemblance to the original duo of @entity117 and carvey ( above ) it 's @entity38 : @entity37 ( above ) dressed up as the lovably androgynous @entity38 , and even got a visit from the lady who created the character , @entity36 ( above ) the morning show 's resident sommeliers , @entity129 and @entity44 , stepped up to the plate next , and proved to be pretty impressive actors as they delivered a remarkably good performance as basement dwelling @entity135 aficionados @entity47 and @entity46 from @entity136			1
and in her torn jeans and black wig , @entity129 almost looked identical to the original @entity46 , @entity117			2
@entity34 and @entity48 followed the ladies , and while they did n't get to do much acting they did get to belt out a tune as they dressed up , and sang , like @entity35 , the @entity143 duo created by @entity144 and the late @entity145			0
even better , @entity144 sent in a video giving the duo his blessing			0
@entity43 's here : @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 ( above ) showed off their derrieres as the ladies from the @entity43 jeans commercial , originally played by funny ladies @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 the original : @entity160 , @entity157 , @entity155 and @entity156 in the original commercial ( above ) , which aired in 2003 during the show 's @entity164 episode then , for what seemed to be the finale , @entity37 came out as @entity38 , the androgynous beauty first played by @entity36 , who was also on hand to do a little skit with @entity37			1
this marks a long running tradition of @entity37 doing drag on @entity0 , having previously dressed up as @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			2
the show had one big surprise however , and ended on a very , very high note , when new moms @entity40 and @entity39 pulled up at the end of the segment in a van and got out to reveal the final costumes of the day - the ladies from the @entity187 commercial			1
memories : @entity37 , as @entity38 , dreamed of one of @entity37 's former drag costumes , @entity37 as @entity174 fiercesome foursome : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity26 and @entity27 kept things going for another hour on today 's take surprise appearance : @entity194 even showed up to reprise his @entity196 role as mr. @entity197 ( above ) the commercial , which first premiered on snl back in 2003 during the show 's @entity164 episode , was written by @entity155 , and starred @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 showing off a new style of jeans that features pleats and a 9 - inch zipper			1
an applique vest comes complimentary with each purchase			0
@entity39 and @entity40 , who were wearing the wigs from the original sketch , were joined by another mom too to round out their group - @entity210			2
the three even filmed their own version of the commercial			0
everyone gets involved : even the production team got in the @entity0 spirit , dressing up as @entity218 dancing in the street : @entity220 really got into the spirit of her character , making her exit by exiting out of a minivan masterpiece theater : @entity37 and @entity228 reenacted one of @entity38 's classic sketches following that reveal , there were more bits from the team , with @entity194 showing up at one point in character as mr. @entity197 from @entity196 to host a mock talent show that featured @entity26 and @entity27 doing another bit and @entity30 falling into some boxes and delivering one of coach @entity243 's famous @entity242 monologues as @entity32			1
@entity194 last appearance on the show came in 2013 on the same day his former @entity247 costar @entity246 was also a guest , an appearance that became memorable after the two had a very awkward exchange on the air when @entity194 asked to say hello to a visibly disinterested @entity246			0
@entity253 derrieres : @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 took some time to show off the junk in their trunk and there 's more : @entity39 , @entity258 and @entity210 also filmed a commercial just like the original @entity187 ad social media response to this year 's costumes was almost universally positive , with @entity264 and @entity265 users showing a particular affinity for the ladies looks as well as mr. @entity26 's cheerleader			1
and while not exactly panned , people had little to say about @entity34 and @entity48 's take on @entity271			0
not weighing in yet , though sure to do so soon , are current and past members of @entity11			0
also staying quiet on social media were past today anchors			0
guess that 's why they call it the blues : @entity48 and @entity34 ( above ) sang and danced as @entity35 no shade : @entity48 and @entity34 had the classic @entity35 suit down ( above ) while also paying tribute to their friends , the today move to do @entity11 costumes may have also been an attempt to give some press to the struggling show on a day when the morning show , which is having its own problems with viewership , is guaranteed to have one of their biggest audiences of the year			1
now in its 40th season , @entity11 has been having some trouble bringing in viewers , with the show 's recent episode featuring former cast member @entity299 marking an all time ratings low for the program			2
the show will no doubt get some help this weekend however thanks to big name host @entity303 and even bigger named musical guest @entity305			0

the anchors of today did an impressive job *portraying* classic @entity11 characters on their @entity0 episode friday
*highlights* *included* @entity30 as @entity89 's @entity32 and @entity26 and @entity27 as the @entity29 cheerleaders
@entity37 dressed in drag , *possibly* , as the androgynous @entity38 , and was visited by @entity36 , who originally played the character
also impressive were @entity44 and @entity45 who played @entity46 and @entity47 from @entity136 , and looked just like the boys
the best costumes came *courtesy* of @entity40 , @entity39 and @entity41 , who were the moms from the @entity187 commercial
the move by today to remind viewers of @entity11 's former *greatness* may have well been a ploy to help the show as its ratings have sunk to record lows
