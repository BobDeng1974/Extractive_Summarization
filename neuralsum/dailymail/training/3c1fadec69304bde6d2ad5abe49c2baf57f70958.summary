these are the haunting scenes inside the city of @entity21 , which is now the only divided capital city in the world - separated by a @entity32 ' green line ' buffer zone			1
around 112 miles long , it divides the @entity25 - occupied northern part of the island from the independent @entity26			1

around this time , both communities suffered hundreds of casualties during widespread fighting - with hundreds more missing , presumed dead			0
the invasion of 1974 resulted in some 37 per cent of the island being captured by @entity25 forces			2
@entity32 peacekeepers have patrolled the area for years to try and prevent clashes between the populations of the two halves of the island			2
in places , the neutral zone spans miles , but in the old town of @entity21 , it is barely 10ft wide - and still filled with echoes of the past ... a plane lies abandoned at @entity21 - a once - thriving hub until the @entity25 invaded @entity26 in 1974 these are the haunting scenes inside the city of @entity21 , which is now the only divided capital city in the world - separated by a @entity32 ' green line ' buffer zone barbed wire fills the inside of the airport , where tourists once passed through on their way to @entity26 's popular beach resorts in the early 1970s , the @entity13 quarter of @entity11 was a top tourist destination , with golden sands , high - rise hotels and shopping precincts , frequented by the likes of @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 ... ... but today , it is a ghost town - the hotels and beaches abandoned @entity32 peacekeepers have patrolled the area for years to try and prevent clashes between the populations of the two halves of the island around 112 miles long , the green line divides the @entity25 - occupied northern part of the island from the independent @entity26			1
