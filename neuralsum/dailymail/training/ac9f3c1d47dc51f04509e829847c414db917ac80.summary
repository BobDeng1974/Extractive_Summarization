when it comes to regrets , the fox in the box has a few – possibly starting with the label given to him by @entity7 manager @entity6			1
injuries , expectations , attitude			0
three words to sum up why a career that promised so much for @entity13 ultimately disappointed			1
these days @entity13 ’s main claim to fame is to be compared to @entity16 and cited as an example of how two teenage prodigies from the same neck of the woods could take such diverging paths			1
they both made their @entity40 debuts at 16 although @entity16 was 38 days younger			1
they made their @entity23 debuts in the same match , a 3 - 1 defeat by @entity26 in 2003			1
@entity13 never played for the seniors again			1
yet for a while it looked as if @entity13 was destined to be as big a star as @entity16 eventually became			1
when @entity6 paid £ 8million for him in 2001 , he was supposed to be the @entity49 bees knees , the final piece of the @entity7 jigsaw			1
three years later he was on his way to @entity53 for £ 2.4million			0
two @entity55 medals were in the trophy cabinet although injury meant that @entity13 was not part of the final match - day squad on either occasion			1
@entity13 built up his reputation as a youngster at @entity40 and signed for @entity7 for £ 8million @entity13 praises @entity6 for being honest with him and admits he looks back on his career with regrets @entity13 scored four goals in 22 @entity67 appearances for the @entity68 and was sold soon after during his time at @entity7 , @entity13 was linked to many clubs with wages a stumbling block			1
these words from @entity74 , then co-owner of @entity75 , could almost have been prophetic			0
he said : ‘ if he wants to sit at @entity7 on his big contract and play golf every day , rather than get on with his career , then he can continue with that			1
‘ @entity13 has got at most 10 years left - and losing something like 150 grand a year is not something i would see as a good career move to be honest			1
‘ but if the alternative is sitting on your backside doing nothing , where is the motivation in that ? ’ good question and one that @entity13 answers honestly			2
‘ i was out , partying , living life – tossing it off in training because i always thought i would n’t play saturday anyway			0
now i look back with a lot of regrets , ’ he admitted to the @entity93			2
‘ that is where i should have been putting it in more			0
@entity6 gave me a fair crack of the whip			0
i have n’t got a bad word to say about him			0
he tells you how it is , one of the only managers i played for who did			0
@entity13 and @entity16 make up the @entity40 bench after the former returned to @entity108 @entity16 , unlike @entity109 , did n't score in the game against @entity26 but has been a revelation ever since ‘ he said there were things going on in my head that should n’t have been and that it was an important time in my career			1
i am not saying i threw it all away because i had a decent career			0
i fulfilled a lot of ambition but i always say it , i know how much ability i had			0
i know how good a player i was			0
one @entity23 cap was n’t enough			2
’ in @entity13 ’s defence , his body let him down too			2
ankle and shoulder injuries struck on what became a long and winding road from @entity53 , to @entity130 , to @entity131 , to @entity132 in @entity26 , to @entity133 , to @entity134 ( @entity135 ) and to @entity136			2
there was a loan move to @entity139 in there , too , but what should have been a six - month stint was cut short			0
‘ for some reason , even towards the end when my career was fizzling out , the press have always taken a big interest in me and what i did , ’ @entity13 added			2
‘ i do n’t know whether people think the same as i think which is : i should have been better			0
’ injuries halted @entity13 ' career , who had limited success with @entity53 among with many other @entity49 sides			0

@entity13 and @entity16 played for @entity23 vs @entity26 in 2003
@entity13 scored on his debut but @entity16 has now made 99 caps
' @entity162 in the box ' most recently played for @entity28
says he has a lot of regrets after failing to make an impact at @entity7
