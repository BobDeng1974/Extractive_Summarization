by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 20 october 2013 the @entity1 has delivered a decisive blow against the creeping new culture of ‘ secret justice ’ after forcing the disclosure of a classified @entity7 judgment about torture in @entity9			1
after a ten - month legal battle , we can at last reveal horrifying allegations over the treatment of prisoners captured by @entity16 forces in @entity9 – evidence the @entity18 wanted to keep secret			1
we can now report that @entity16 officials , with the express approval of @entity21 foreign secretary @entity20 , were duped into handing over one particular detainee to the @entity9 security service			1
the newly disclosed judgment reveals how he told that he was beaten with steel rods , whipped with electric cables and deprived of sleep for days – and showed the scars to prove it			1
critics of secret justice said the new revelations indicate the @entity18 resorted to a secret hearing to cover their own embarrassment at handing the detainee over – and not to protect both his own and the @entity16 ’s national interest , as they claimed			1
crucially , the breakthrough is the first time parts of a formerly secret judgment have been published.even more significantly , it concerns the very case which inspired the government to introduce this year ’s hugely controversial @entity45 – the law which formally enshrines secret hearings and secret judgments in the legal system , a radical departure from centuries of tradition			1
ever since it was first mooted , this newspaper has campaigned to expose the threat to democracy and openness that secret courts represent			1
the @entity7 decision last week to allow publication of some of the secret @entity9 prisoner judgment is the first victory in that campaign			1
the battle began in april 2010			1
@entity65 , a peace campaigner , asked the @entity7 to stop transfers of prisoners captured by @entity16 forces to the @entity9 security service , the @entity69 , on the grounds they would be tortured			1
the court , led by @entity72 , responded in part with a judgment that was public : it said that transfers to @entity69 jails in @entity78 and @entity79 in @entity80 could continue as long as @entity16 forces ‘ monitored ’ prisoners ’ fates			1
but it added that no more prisoners should be sent to the nds in @entity85			1
critically , the reasons for making this distinction were contained in a second secret judgment			1
the reasons can only now be published , after the @entity89 successfully challenged the continuing secrecy			2
decision : @entity72 responded in part with a judgement that was public we can reveal the secret ruling concerns a supposed @entity97 leader , described only as @entity98			1
when he was held by @entity16 troops in january 2010 , there was already a moratorium banning the transfer of prisoners to the @entity69 in @entity85 , because its interrogation centre there – codenamed @entity107 17 – had gained a sinister reputation for torture and @entity16 forces found it impossible to gain access			1
the now - declassified judgment states that dr @entity114 , the @entity69 chief , persuaded @entity16 officials to hand over @entity98 , after giving his personal assurance that he would be cared for humanely and would be allowed weekly visits from the @entity16			2
according to a witness statement by a senior @entity123 official which also was not disclosed in 2010 , the ultimate decision to comply with dr @entity114 ’s request was taken by @entity21 foreign secretary @entity20 and armed forces minister @entity125 , on the grounds that the prisoner could more easily be prosecuted in @entity85 – so breaching their own moratorium			2
but as the judgment now reveals , dr @entity114 ’s promises proved worthless			1
once in @entity85 , @entity98 806 ‘ disappeared ’ for a month			2
when he did finally meet two @entity132 personnel , he told them he had been beaten with steel rods about his legs and feet , punched in the head , torso , arms and testicles , and deprived of sleep for days			2
on a subsequent visit , he said he had also been whipped with electric cables			2
some of his injuries were photographed			2
triumph over secret justice : mail on sunday 's critical victory public concern : home secretary @entity146 said @entity20 ( pictured ) ' broke our own moratorium and handed over a prisoner to be tortured ' which he says ' is a clear matter of public concern , which using a secret court covered up ' ' far from protecting national security , this was about hiding political embarrassment ' says former shadow home secretary @entity146 ( pictured ) in 2010 , the @entity18 asked for the evidence and judgment in the case to stay secret to ‘ protect national security ’ and preserve relations with the @entity9 government			1
they also said disclosure might put prisoners at risk of reprisals			1
but last night former shadow home secretary @entity146 said : ‘ far from protecting national security , this was about hiding political embarrassment			2
’ he added : ‘ the fact @entity20 broke our own moratorium and handed over a prisoner to be tortured is a clear matter of public concern , which using a secret court covered up			2
this is a very bad harbinger for the secret justice procedures which the new @entity45 creates			2
’ this newspaper ’s lawyers , led by @entity180 , argued that full disclosure was in the public interest			1
however , parts of the judgment – we do not even know how much – are still secret			2
the @entity7 also refused our request to lay down guidelines to ensure future secret judgments are regularly reviewed , to allow publication as soon as possible			2
an @entity18 spokeswoman said the ministry was happy that parts of the secret judgment had been disclosed , but added : ‘ there are exceptional cases in which closed proceedings are necessary to safeguard national security			2
’ neither mr @entity20 nor mr @entity125 responded to @entity89 requests for comment			0
whipped : an illustration showing how @entity98 suffered in @entity85 it must have been a perilous operation : a raid by @entity16 forces on a @entity97 stronghold which resulted in the capture of an alleged insurgent leader – the man who would be described as @entity98			0
his true identity remains unknown			0
what is certain is that by early january 2010 , he was a prisoner at the @entity16 base @entity210 , the sprawling fortress north - west of @entity79 , the capital of @entity80 – the killing field where more than 400 @entity16 service personnel have died			0
there , his living conditions were civilised , with access to showers and exercise			0
but @entity16 forces can not legally hold @entity97 prisoners indefinitely			1
if @entity98 were not to be freed , he had to be prosecuted under @entity9 law			1
for this there was a well - established routine , starting with the prisoner ’s transfer to the @entity79 branch of the @entity69 , the @entity9 @entity227			0
but instead , says the once - secret @entity7 judgment which @entity1 had declassified last week , @entity98 was consigned to the @entity69 in @entity85 – despite the fact @entity16 had officially banned all transfers there since 2008 , because of the risk they would be tortured			1
the decision was ultimately taken by the then foreign secretary , @entity20 , and the @entity236 , @entity125			0
this , says the judgment , issued in its secret form in april 2010 , followed ‘ specific reassurances ’ from the @entity69 chief @entity114 that ‘ [ the prisoner ] would be treated humanely and that @entity16 officials would be given full access to him			0
’ ' reassurances ' : @entity69 chief @entity114 , ( pictured here speaking during a gathering in @entity85 ) said the prisoner ' would be treated humanely ' dr @entity114 was a plausible , highly regarded figure : educated and a contributor to newspapers such as the @entity251			0
he was also vehemently anti-taliban			0
however , his assurances were bogus			0
after @entity254 was transferred to @entity85 on january 15 , the judgment goes on , ‘ @entity16 @entity256 staff experienced considerable difficulty with gaining access			0
they contacted the @entity69 on an almost daily basis			0
it was not possible to visit the detainee until february 14 , almost a month after he had been transferred by the @entity16			0
’ the judgment adds : ‘ the @entity16 ’s repeated efforts to secure a visit were blocked by a series of unsatisfactory excuses			0
@entity16 officials were given the runaround until questioning of @entity98 had been completed , and this was done despite the specific assurances given prior to his transfer			0
’ when two @entity132 personnel finally did get to see him , he was being held at @entity107 , a notorious @entity69 interrogation centre – a place dr @entity114 had promised he would not be taken to			0
he told the officers he had been ‘ beaten with steel rods to the area of his legs and feet , causing bruising and bleeding to his toes ( he claimed he could not walk or stand after the beating ) ; he had been punched on his face ; and his testicles had been punched , grabbed and rubbed			0
he had been subjected to sleep deprivation and had been made to stand up for five consecutive nights			0
’ the @entity69 , he added , ‘ had told him that if he reported any abuse to “ the foreigners ” he would be beaten or killed			0
’ the officers took photographs of his injuries			0
the following evening dr @entity114 told them detainee 806 ’s interrogation had been a great success : he had ‘ been very forthcoming , without any pressure from the @entity69			0
’ two weeks later , the @entity16 visited the prisoner again			0
this time , he said he had been slapped , punched , and whipped , ‘ with what he described as electrical wiring about 24in long			0
’ the secret judgment said the judges could not determine the prisoner ’s credibility			1
but it added : ‘ we consider that the only safe way to proceed is on the assumption that the allegations are true			1
’ nevertheless , the judges said in 2010 that there was no good reason to make his claims public : ‘ the public interest considerations in favour of non-disclosure ought in our view to prevail			1
’ the judgment contains details of threats and torture endured by other prisoners , including another man allegedly beaten with cables			1
all of them , until this newspaper went to court , would have stayed secret indefinitely			0
‘ the judgment shows the @entity16 government knew detainees were being tortured , yet this information was withheld from the public , ’ @entity331 , the solicitor who represented @entity1 , said yesterday			1
‘ we are moving into an era when more and more of our justice system is going to unfold in secret – and yet there is n’t even a mechanism for ensuring that judgments such as this eventually enter the public domain			0
’ the @entity18 has asked the court to order this newspaper to pay its costs – a sum which could easily exceed £ 20,000			0
we are fighting this demand .			0
