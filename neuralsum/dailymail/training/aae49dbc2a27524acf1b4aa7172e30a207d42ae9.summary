i ’ve always wanted to work abroad , ' said the 51 - year - old @entity18			0
i had several offers to manage in the @entity2			1
‘ but this is the opportunity to manage in @entity5			2

' i had the choice			0
the president gave me the opportunity			0

but i had to be sure i was climbing to a club with ambition , because i want to win			2
