does any player fluctuate between world - beater and under - achiever more than @entity3 ? currently on a high after his stunning equaliser for @entity7 against @entity8 in @entity9 on tuesday night , the 23 - year - old @entity5 winger has already had more ups and downs than most players experience in their careers			1
on his day , @entity3 stands in comparison with the very best			2
he terrifies defenders with his speed and directness – a trait he also possesses off the pitch judging by his ' told you so ' tweet to a critical @entity22 this week			0
that ability was first noticed two years ago when he single - handedly tried to save @entity24 from relegation with a string of virtuoso performances			0
later in 2013 , he turned in two of the great international displays of recent years when he destroyed @entity30 and @entity31 at @entity32 to book @entity7 's place at the @entity34			1
@entity3 unleashes an unstoppable right - footed strike from 20 yards to score @entity7 's equaliser the @entity5 and @entity7 winger celebrates his goal against @entity8 , which was his third for his country his strike in @entity9 , measured at 77.2mph , was further evidence he belongs on the top table			1
' we are indebted to @entity45 – he is a game - changer , ' said @entity7 manager @entity47			2
and yet ... how can a player with @entity3 's obvious ability be sent out to nine different clubs on loan by @entity5			1
why has he still not played a full 90 minutes for his club in the @entity53 this season ? how come in the autumn it was @entity3 rather than @entity56 who was seen as surplus to requirements at @entity60 ? he has scored as many goals for @entity7 as he has done in the @entity53 for @entity5			1
wingers are by nature of their position more inconsistent than other players			0
if they are starved of service , they can appear ineffectual			0
and if they try too hard when they do get the ball , they can squander possession			0
and even by wingers ' standards , @entity3 is a risk - taker			2
it can make him look unstoppable at times and a waste of time at others			0
@entity47 admitted agonising about giving him a debut ahead of @entity81 and @entity82 against @entity30 18 months ago , but he was man of the match and scored the important third goal in a 4 - 1 @entity7 victory			1
@entity3 celebrates scoring @entity7 's third goal against @entity30 in a @entity34 qualifier @entity3 as a pundit for @entity89 during the @entity34 articulate and bright – his father @entity90 is a leading figure in football 's anti-racism body @entity92 – he was comfortable in the television studio as a pundit at last summer 's @entity34 when an ankle injury ruled him out of @entity47 's squad			1
sometimes intelligence also means a determination to play the game your way , not always appreciated by managers obsessed by tactics			0
@entity3 thrived with @entity105 at @entity24 but it did n't look as if he fitted in under @entity107 at @entity5			1
he started the season being used for @entity110 and @entity111 games rather than the important @entity53 stuff			0
even now , if things are n't going well , the chances are @entity3 will be sacrificed			2
at @entity115 he was taken off after half an hour when @entity5 were being beaten 2 - 0 by @entity116			2
but he is starting games now ahead of £ 25million @entity118 with another rival , @entity56 , loaned out to @entity120			0
for his club , he has hit some rarefied heights , most notably a @entity124 game against @entity125 when he scored a goal and made two others			2
when @entity47 's squad was announced for the recent double - header against @entity130 and @entity8 , @entity22 claimed @entity3 should n't have been included			1
the player had scored for @entity7 against @entity132 this season but missed the @entity135 and @entity136 games with another ankle injury , another reason for his inconsistency			1
following his equaliser , @entity3 tweeted in response : ' not bad for a player who should be ' nowhere near the squad ''			2
he later added he hoped he had silenced his critics			0
@entity3 looks dejected after his first - half substitution during @entity5 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity116 the truth is @entity3 's style may be best suited to international football which after all is cup knockout when you get to the big tournaments			1
for the grind of a full @entity53 season , you ca n't afford to have one thrilling moment followed by wasting possession or a wayward shot			0
the statistics back that up			0
he has scored three goals in seven games for @entity7 compared with three in 21 @entity53 starts for @entity5			1
he will have to try to improve on that ratio when he dons his club shirt again at @entity163 on sunday			0
in that sense , you can understand why @entity47 will continue to pick him regardless of club form			1
he is , in the manger 's words , a game - changer			0
@entity5 will be hoping that @entity3 can replicate his international form for his club			1

@entity3 scored @entity7 's equaliser against @entity8 on tuesday
goal was the @entity5 winger 's third in seven games for @entity7
but @entity3 's club form has been *patchy* in last two seasons
*challenge* now is for @entity3 to replicate international form for @entity5
