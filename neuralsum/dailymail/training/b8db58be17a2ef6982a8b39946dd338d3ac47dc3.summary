@entity3 's @entity30 told the @entity5 : ' @entity3 expects regular reporting by broadcasters to help improve subtitles over time , as well as allowing us to identify exactly which areas need most progress			0
' an embarrassing mistake spotted by an eagle - eyed @entity39 viewer seventy channels in the @entity41 now provide a subtitling service , and a consultation which started in may suggested that problems began when pre-recorded programmes were delivered to broadcasters too late to allow subtitles to be prepared in advance			1
@entity3 will publish a report based on its findings in spring 2014 , and use the evidence to decide is changes to the current guidelines are needed			0
the @entity5 reported that the watchdog has also asked broadcasters to consider adding a time delay to live programming that is not time - sensitive , so that the quality of subtitling can be improved			2

the @entity60 also suffered a toe - curling gaffe with its sub-title service after it accidentally confused the word ' rate ' for ' rape ' during a fashion segment			0
live football commentary is also subtitled which has resulted in @entity105 being called @entity106 and former @entity108 keeper @entity107 becoming ' @entity109			2
' but these kinds of errors are not just confined to the @entity41			1
@entity112 in the @entity113 apologised after accidentally mis - subtitling the @entity114			0
