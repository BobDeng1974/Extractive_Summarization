by @entity0 after years of experimentation , i can now apply a smoky eye with the best of them and know exactly what foundation suits my face			0
but the problem comes when i run out of contact lenses and have to wear my glasses , usually reserved for nights in with the tv			1
suddenly my carefully applied eye make - up looks a bit wrong			1
fortunately , a new book , @entity16 , by make - up guru @entity17 , gives spec - specific tips for girls who wear glasses			1
we put them to the test			0
specs appeal : @entity0 tries out @entity17 's tips since most people who wear glasses have frames that allow at least the top of their eyebrows to be seen , keeping them neat and well defined is key			1
it ’s very hard using tweezers to get a sharp line , so if you do want to remove hairs , opt for threading for a perfectly straight brow			2
@entity17 recommends defining brows with a product the same colour as your hair , so your glasses do n’t overpower your face			1
we used a blend of powder and wax — the @entity47 ( £ 17 , smashbox.co.uk ) — applied with a fine brush to fill in gaps , tame rogue hairs and give a clean , full line			0
@entity17 says the glass in your frames can highlight under - eye discolouration and darkness — bad news for anyone who suffers from dark circles or bags			1
look for peach - toned concealers that will neutralise grey or blue and make the area look brighter without bleaching it out			1
benefit ’s boi - ing concealer ( £ 17.50 , benefitcosmetics.co.uk ) comes in five shades and hides shadows without looking creased or caked			1
@entity17 says your eyeshadow should n’t compete with your glasses , so it ’s best to keep things neutral if you ’re long - sighted , your lenses can magnify your eyes — while if you ’re short - sighted , you may find your specs make your eyes look smaller			1
either way , you tend not to see as much of the eye socket , so the outline of the eye should be the focus of applying make - up rather than the lid			1
@entity17 says your eyeshadow should n’t compete with your glasses , so it ’s best to keep things neutral			1
a cream shadow will give a bit of a sheen as a counterpoint to the very matte base — we used @entity94 24hr @entity93 in @entity95 ( £ 4.99 , boots.com )			0
@entity17 ’s golden rule is that eyeliner is key because it adds definition			1
and whether your eyes look big or small through your lenses , a clean sweep of eyeliner wo n’t leave you looking squinty or bug - eyed			2
use a liquid liner pen to draw a solid line across the top — @entity107 ’s @entity106 ( £ 22 , charlottetilbury.com ) makes it very easy			2
spectacle wearers spend an average of £ 149 a year on glasses then , to give the tops of the eyes even more definition , use a kohl liner on the top water line , just inside the eyelid			2
@entity119 ’s glide - on ( £ 15 , debenhams.com ) is soft to apply but waterproof and long - lasting			1
on the lower water line , just inside the lid , use a liner that will open the eye up — white is too harsh , so look for a metallic cream , a pale gold or a pale metallic pink like by @entity128 in @entity129 ( £ 23 , spacenk.com )			0
for a cheaper option , seek out @entity132 ’s @entity131 ( £ 2 , avonshop.co.uk )			0
most glasses sit far enough from the eyes so that , even when curled , lashes should n’t hit the lenses , so curl them as you normally would , at the base to open up the eye			0
but when it comes to mascara , rather than going for a lengthening one , look for one that will thicken and give volume instead			0
@entity144 ’s @entity144 ( £ 24 , houseoffraser.co.uk ) makes lashes look thick and full without clumping			0
keep the bottom lashes free of mascara as — like the glasses frame — this can cast shadows under the eye , making it look very dark			0
and , if your lashes do hit your lenses , @entity17 suggests opting for a waterproof mascara that wo n’t smudge			2
without glasses : after years of experimentation , @entity158 is confident in her make - up routine when she is wearing her contact lenses use a matte foundation to stop the slide of glasses down your face — try @entity167 ( £ 34 , spacenk.com )			1
to avoid your blusher clashing with the lower part of your glasses , avoid putting colour on the apples of your cheeks and instead contour your face and give it structure			0
use a powder blusher to keep your face matte , suck in your cheeks and , working from the outside edge , sweep a bronzer or brownish pink blusher into the hollow — try @entity182 ’s @entity181 in @entity183 ( £ 18 , maccosmetics.co.uk )			0
the old adage says you should pick lips or eyes to emphasise			0
but although the eye area is defined with glasses , they can also act as a barrier to your peepers , so you can get away with using a dramatic shade on your lips — we went for @entity182 ’s @entity196 ( £ 15 , maccosmetics.co.uk ) with @entity197 ( £ 16.50 , narscosmetics.co.uk )			2
