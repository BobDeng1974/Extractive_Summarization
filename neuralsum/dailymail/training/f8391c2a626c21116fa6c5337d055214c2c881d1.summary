by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 06:55 est , 31 january 2013 tasteless : @entity1 stars in @entity2 , the first comedy produced by sir @entity4 's film studio @entity3 not since she dallied on the deck of the @entity6 with @entity7 has @entity1 had a screen role so ill - fated			1
but while @entity10 ’s 1997 blockbuster made the @entity12 actress a superstar , she must be hoping her latest film follows in the wake of the doomed ship , and sinks without trace			1
for @entity2 — the first comedy produced by sir @entity4 ’s film studio @entity3 — is a @entity18 movie so unremittingly awful that it had to be sneaked out on an unsuspecting public before critics could see it and warn them			1
but now that they ’ve seen the final edit and reached for the tranquillisers ( if not a revolver ) , it ’s hard to imagine they would dream of encouraging anyone to actually see it			0
even the famously publicity - hungry sir @entity4 has gone suddenly quiet after hailing the film on his blog last week — then saying he hoped ‘ the most outrageous comedy ever made … will put a smile on your face ’			1
last year , @entity1 , 37 , saved @entity4 ’s elderly mother from a house fire on his @entity42 island of @entity43 , and the actress recently married his nephew @entity46			1
@entity4 has now rewarded the oscar - winner by forever linking her with a film that tries to get laughs from a woman ’s scatological sexual preferences , a teenager ’s first menstruation , a woman who uses her breasts to stir guacamole , and a man whose testicles dangle from his throat			1
there ’s more , but it ’s not printable			0
as @entity18 shakes its head and wonders whatever possessed so many stars to get involved in such barrel - scraping sleaze , many of @entity65 ’s top critics believe they may have witnessed cinematic history			1
quite simply , @entity2 — now on general release in @entity12 — could be the worst film ever made			1
the reviews , which are far more entertaining than the actual film , do n’t pull any punches			1
respected @entity65 critic @entity74 describes it as the ‘ @entity76 of awful ’			0
most of his colleagues struggle to remember another film so dire			1
the ‘ gross - out ’ humour of defecation , perverted sex , cruelty and rampant political incorrectness is n’t even funny or original , they complain			1
but the general dismay at how low the standards of taste have sunk is matched by sheer bewilderment at how the film ever came to be made			1
as one @entity96 critic put it : ‘ was someone holding @entity1 ’s children hostage ? did @entity92 or @entity93 have gambling debts ? ’ not funny : the film features 30 big - name stars , including @entity100 ( pictured in a scene from the film ) but it 's ' gross - out ' humour has been panned by critics worst film ever ? director @entity105 ( right ) has has told critics , who complain @entity18 never does anything new but ' flip out ' when they get it , to ' lighten up ' comedy : @entity110 and @entity92 in a scene from @entity2 , which some believe may be the worst film ever made if the cast had done it for the money , one might have understood			1
but insiders say it was produced on a shoestring , with its stars agreeing to be paid the union minimum rates of around $ 800 ( around £ 500 ) a day			1
the entire film cost a lean $ 6 million ( and amazingly recouped almost all that in its opening weekend in the @entity65 )			1
its main director , @entity105 , was responsible for the popular , if obscene , @entity131 comedies @entity127 and there ’s @entity128			0
stung by the abuse about @entity2 , he has tweeted to critics : ‘ you always complain that @entity18 never gives you new stuff , and then when you get it , you flip out			2
’ the ‘ comedy ’ — and the term has perhaps never been more loosely used — is composed of a dozen short films or sketches linked by a flimsy plotline			2
@entity142 and @entity143 star in a scene from the film , which is composed of a dozen short films or sketches linked together i watched it in an almost empty @entity96 cinema this week			2
the only other occupant walked out after ten minutes			0
the sketches that drove her away included the first , in which @entity1 goes on a blind date with @entity93 — star of @entity156 and @entity157			0
here he plays a successful lawyer whose only flaw is a pair of testicles hanging from his throat			0
apparently , @entity1 is the only person in the restaurant who notices anything amiss			0
the next skit continues in the same taste - free vein with a-list actress @entity169 and @entity171 - nominated actor @entity170 playing parents who home - school their teenage son			2
determined to give him the full high - school experience , especially with sex , his father propositions him while his mother ends up @entity182 - kissing him			2
later on , @entity100 and @entity183 — who wrote @entity184 with @entity185 — go on a date in which they play truth or dare			0
@entity190 - winning @entity189 ends up stirring guacamole with what ’s clearly a prosthetic breast			2
some of the sketches are even more disgusting			0
in one , a young woman wants her fiancé to do something unspeakable to her			0
in a second , actress @entity198 is drenched with cat urine from her boyfriend ’s jealous pet , and ripped to pieces by children			0
her fate is marginally better than the foul - mouthed leprechaun played by @entity12 action star @entity207 , who is tortured and murdered by two friends trying to get their hands on his pot of gold			2
so how did this glittering piece of movie - making history make it to the screen ? its producer , @entity216 , claims he came up with the idea 15 years ago			1
but various directors pulled out , and his actor of choice , @entity222 , refused point - blank to play a man unable to chat up women			2
but four years ago the film finally took flight when @entity216 met @entity93 at a wedding and he later agreed to do it			2
astonishingly , @entity1 also liked the script			0
the sketch featuring her and @entity93 was then used to persuade a @entity18 studio , @entity231 , to distribute the movie			1
and insiders say the producers and director called in a lot of favours from actor friends			0
sir @entity4 last week boasted on his blog how one of the producers overheard a businessman saying how he 'd watched the trailer and never laughed so much in his life the fact each role only took a few days to film helped their cause			1
and some of the ‘ serious ’ actors said they wanted to try their hand at risqué comedy any - way			1
in fact , director @entity105 insisted that all the stars ‘ wanted to push it further ’ , although it is far from clear how they could have sunk even lower			2
the film took nearly four years to make because production had to fit in with the cast ’s other filming commitments			2
the producers admitted the actors were n’t ‘ completely aware ’ of the other sketches , and few bothered to ask			0
‘ they were attracted to their script , and as long as that tickled their funnybone , that was enough , ’ said co-producer @entity263			0
tv personality @entity269 ( left ) and the film 's producer @entity216 ( right ) attend the premiere in @entity273 friends of @entity1 have defended her decision to take part , saying she spent only a few days filming it , and pointing out that she clearly was n’t the only star who thought the script was funny			1
‘ not everything turns out as well as it looks on the printed page , ’ said one			0
insiders insisted that she agreed to appear in the film before her romance began with @entity286 , whom she secretly married in @entity96			2
that aside , there are rumours in @entity18 that many of @entity2 ’s stars are regretting their involvement			0
the thought of being associated with the most derided film in @entity18 history must be utterly galling			0
last week , sir @entity4 boasted on his blog how one of the producers overheard a businessman saying how he ’d watched the trailer and never laughed so much in his life			1
‘ i think it ’s a @entity3 film , which makes total sense , ’ this businessman apparently added			0
‘ that crazy @entity305 is taking over the world ! ’ one wonders whether sir @entity4 feels so all - conquering now			1
unless , of course , it was always the plan to add ‘ world ’s most unwatchable movie disaster ’ to his list of achievements			0
@entity2 ’s provocative tagline is : ‘ once you see it , you ca n’t unsee it			0
’ there ’s a simple solution to that conundrum , and it ’s one that a small army of humbled @entity18 stars are praying you take : do n’t see it .			0
