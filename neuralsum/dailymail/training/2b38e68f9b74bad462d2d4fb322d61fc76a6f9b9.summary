by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 16:47 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 12 july 2013 @entity4 ’s ceo announced a broad companywide shakeup just as many tech industry analysts are proclaiming the ‘ death of the pc ’ amid sharply declining personal computer sales and the tepid performance of the @entity10 operating system			1
@entity13 said thursday that the changes mean the company is ‘ rallying behind a single strategy ’ with an aim to take the unwieldy tech giant ‘ in a bold new direction			1
' while it has been widely anticipated , it 's too early to tell how well the reorganization — the company ’s largest in five years — will help @entity4 compete with more nimble rivals like @entity25 and @entity26			1
‘ you do n't make massive , sweeping changes like this unless something is wrong , ’ said @entity32 , an analyst at @entity33 , pointing to wednesday 's reports of declining pc shipments around the world			2
worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 11 percent in the april - june period , according to data from research firms @entity45 and @entity46			0
@entity45 said the @entity12 industry is now experiencing the longest decline in its history , as shipments dropped for the fifth consecutive quarter			0
@entity52 , the former president of @entity53 , will retire			1
his departure follows that of gaming chief @entity56 , now ceo of @entity58 , and @entity59 , formerly head of the @entity62 unit			2
@entity4 's lackluster stock performance has amplified speculation that the company might consider replacing @entity13 , who took over when co-founder @entity66 stepped down as ceo 13 years ago			1
bold : @entity13 says it will be bold , but others wonder if the changes are n't just a scramble to catch up with rivals in a stalled corner of the tech market analysts have blamed a massive consumer migration to tablets and other mobile devices for the falloff			1
but many observers also believe @entity4 's @entity10 operating system - which comes installed on most new pcs - has turned consumers off			0
the company 's new divisions include engineering , marketing and business development			2
@entity4 named veteran executive @entity89 head of its devices and studios engineering group , overseeing hardware development , games , music and entertainment			0
she had been promoted in november to lead all @entity62 software and hardware engineering after @entity59 , the president of its @entity62 and @entity99 operations , left the company shortly after the launch of @entity10			1
@entity102 will lead @entity4 's operating systems and engineering group , namely @entity62			0
@entity105 will head applications and services			0
@entity13 stressed the company 's focus on ‘ one @entity4 ’ in his memo			1
he said @entity4 will move forward operating as a cohesive company rather than a ‘ collection of divisional strategies			2
’ ‘ although we will deliver multiple devices and services to execute and monetize the strategy , the single core strategy will drive us to set shared goals for everything we do			0
we will see our product line holistically , not as a set of islands , ’ @entity13 wrote			2
the shake - up is being driven by competitive pressures as two of @entity4 's once much - smaller rivals , @entity25 and @entity26 , have emerged as the technology trendsetters			1
in a world that increasingly revolves around mobile devices and internet services , @entity4 has been scrambling to adapt to the upheaval			0
the company wants to ensure its relevance in the future while protecting the personal computer franchise that has always generated most of its revenue			2
@entity139 has already been noted by @entity140			0
both @entity25 and @entity26 boast market values higher than @entity4 , despite a surge in @entity4 's stock price during the past three months			1
outdated ? @entity4 hopes to condense some of its more far flung arms into a more cohesive company dubbed by ceo @entity4 ' to compete with nimbler rivals @entity25 and @entity26 the reorganization could be @entity13 's attempt at placating shareholders with a dramatic overhaul that appears to borrow elements of @entity25 's and @entity26 's set - ups			1
the winnowing of @entity4 's disparate divisions and @entity13 's rallying cry for ‘ one @entity4 ’ suggests the company is trying to make its products work together more seamlessly , much like @entity25 has been doing since the late @entity159 returned as that company 's ceo in the late 1990s			1
at the same time , @entity13 appears determined to eliminate bureaucracy in hopes of making @entity4 operate more like a nimble startup able to quickly innovate - a goal that @entity26 ceo @entity166 set out to achieve when he took over leadership of that company two years ago			1
@entity170 analyst @entity169 said the reorganization helps align @entity4 's various divisions around its devices and services strategy , but he added that he 's taking a ‘ wait and see ’ approach			2
‘ we continue to look for signs on how the company can leverage its success in the @entity182 business to re-energize its current efforts in the tablet and smartphone markets , ’ @entity169 wrote in a note to investors			0
@entity33 's @entity32 noted that major reorganizations ‘ can serve as a negative distraction for months before potentially offering benefits			0
’ @entity4 shares rose $ 1.01 , or nearly 3 percent , to close at $ 35.71 on thursday			0
the @entity192 , @entity193 - based company 's stock is up 32 percent since the start of the year , compared with a 17 percent increase in the @entity196			0
more woes : in addition to its industry - wide woes , @entity4 's @entity10 is widely seen as a flop and likely added to pressures leading up to the shakeup			0

ceo @entity13 announced the unwieldy tech giant is headed ' in a bold new direction ' as some herald the ' death of the pc '
the company hopes to compete with their more nimble , trendsetting rivals @entity25 and @entity26
president of @entity53 division @entity52 will retire as part of the reorganization as other big wigs bite their nails over *upcoming* changes
