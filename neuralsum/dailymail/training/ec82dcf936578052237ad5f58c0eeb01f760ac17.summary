the @entity1 animal shelter in @entity2 took in their fattest cat yet this week , a massive 36 - pound feline appropriately named meatball			1
the morbidly obese cat was surrendered at the shelter in @entity9 on tuesday after being shuffled from home to home over the years			0
shelter spokesman @entity12 says @entity6 is ' the biggest cat i have ever seen ' and that he ' does n't move too quickly '			2
fat cat : meatball weighs in four times heavier than an average cat heavy load : a shelter employee holds meatball , the 36 - pound cat recently dropped off at the @entity1 animal shelter @entity6 's last owners took him in from someone else and had cared for the cat for about six months before he started ' having accidents around the house ' so they gave him up			1
they said he was that size when they got him and they did n't know why he was so fat since they had only been feeding him cat food			0
but ms @entity12 says she does n't know how accurate that is ' because cat food is n't typically going to make a cat this large '			0
immobile : meatball has problems moving as a result of his weight new diet : the pet has been put on a special diet to help him lose weight what he eats now : meatball is currently on a restricted diet of wet food in the morning and at night she says eating human table scraps , or being left food out all day can make a cat that fat but @entity6 's weight could be a result of an underlying condition like a thyroid problem			1
she does n't know if that 's the case with @entity6 since they have n't done any blood work yet			0
to take off the pounds , the shelter has now put meatball on a restricted , low calorie diet - feeding him a little bit of wet food in the morning and at night			1
meatball is n't too interested in the food however , further proving ms @entity12 's theory that he has n't been on a regulated diet			2
diet : shelter spokesman @entity12 says feeding a cat table scraps or letting them eat cat food all day can result in obesity ' most cats , if you give them canned food - that 's heaven			1
so when i opened [ a can ] i thought he 'd some right over , ' she said			0
instead meatball picks at the wet food , eating a little now and coming back to eat some more later - never eating the full portion in one sitting			1
because of @entity6 's size , he ca n't stay in any of the normal cat kennels so he hangs out in the administrative offices at the shelter 's @entity95 location			2
while @entity6 is extremely friendly , due to his health the shelter will not be putting him up adoption			2
healthy loss : the shelter is hoping to secure meatball a place at a sanctuary that would be able to monitor his weight loss his weight puts him at risk for serious medical problems and he already has glaucoma in one eye			1
instead they are looking to find meatball a spot at a rescue organization that specializes in overweight cats			1
the sanctuary they are currently looking at would carefully monitor @entity6 's weight loss , and since he should be 12 pounds it 's going to take some time			0
this is n't the first hefty car that the shelter has brought in			0
last year the shelter took in a 28 - pound stray			0
meatball also happens to be the name of the famouly - fat cat in the film @entity126 , starring @entity127 and @entity128 .			0

the last owners had @entity6 for about six months before he started having accidents around the house
meatball is now on a low calorie , diet of wet food served twice a day
the shelter is looking to secure meatball a place at a sanctuary that specialized in overweight cats
