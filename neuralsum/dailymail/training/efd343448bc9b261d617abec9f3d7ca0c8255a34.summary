by @entity0 published : 13:08 est , 10 february 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 11 february 2013 schoolgirl @entity1 was stunned when she opened her satchel in class - and discovered that her pet rabbit had bunny - hopped inside for a nap			1
the 11 - year - old was rummaging inside her bag to find her pencil case when she spotted @entity8 , her @entity10 rabbit , snuggled up with her exercise books			1
the furry fugitive caused panic as teachers and pupils rushed to take care of the floppy - eared stowaway which leapt across the classroom after @entity1 discovered him			1
hopping mad : @entity1 had the shock of her life when she arrived at school to find her pet rabbit had hitched a ride in her schoolbag stowaway : pet rabbit @entity8 had hopped into @entity1 's bag as she fed her other pets before heading to school in a tale similar to the nursery rhyme ' @entity32 had a @entity33 ' , @entity8 had sneaked into @entity1 's bag while she was feeding her three other rabbits at their home in @entity36 , @entity37 , before she left for school			1
astonishingly , @entity1 walked to the bus stop and then travelled three miles to @entity40 , unaware that her cheeky pet had hitched a lift			1
she said : ' i had put my bag down in the garden , where the rabbits were running freely about and @entity8 must have jumped in			2
' i did think my bag was a bit heavy when i stood at the bus stop but i thought it must be because i had a project and some extra homework in there			0
surprise visitor : @entity1 was rummaging in her bag to find her pencil case when she spotted @entity8 her @entity10 rabbit snuggled up with her exercise books @entity58 pupil : @entity1 said that @entity8 was shaking a bit at first but soon calmed down , and her friends enjoyed petting the rabbit ' i could n't believe it when i reached in for my pencil case and she jumped out			1
one girl screamed but most people just laughed - i was so embarrassed			0
' @entity8 was shaking a bit at first but soon calmed down and i think she enjoyed everyone petting her			2
' @entity1 's shocked teacher then called the schoolgirl 's mother , @entity69 , 49 , who came to collect @entity8 from the school			1
@entity72 : @entity1 's mother @entity69 suspected that @entity8 had snuck into her daughter 's bag to keep warm the it project manager admitted that at first she had suspected that @entity1 had taken her beloved pet to school with her on purpose			1
' when i got the phone call from the school i could n't believe it , i thought @entity1 must have done it deliberately , ' she said			2
' but then i realised that while the rabbits are outside every morning she leaves her bag out there with them			0
' since she carries a lot of books to school @entity8 must have just crawled in there in the snug warm with them			0
' i think it sent the whole school into hysterics			0
' initially they assumed it was deliberate but when they realised what had happened the whole school went to work to look after @entity8			0
' they took her to reception for the youngsters to see and grabbed some lettuce from the kitchen to feed her			0
' i think @entity8 is loving the attention , she used to be quite a grumpy rabbit , but now she seems to be basking in the limelight			2
' @entity1 always lets the rabbits out at 7.30am before she leaves , then catches the bus at eight			0
' then her younger sister @entity111 brings them all in before she goes to her school			0
' but last friday i got the phone call before @entity111 even had time to go outside			0
' pet project : @entity116 , vice-principal at @entity40 described the school as ' so good that even pets want to come ' @entity40 vice-principal @entity116 said that he had never known a pupil 's pet to make it into the classroom with their young owner until adventurous @entity8 decided that she would join @entity1 for lessons			1
' it 's the first time we 've had a rabbit come to school - the college is clearly so good that even pets want to come , ' he said			2
having proved to be so popular with @entity1 's schoolmates , @entity8 was allowed to return to the classroom the following week so pupils could pet their new friend - although this time her visit had been planned .			1
