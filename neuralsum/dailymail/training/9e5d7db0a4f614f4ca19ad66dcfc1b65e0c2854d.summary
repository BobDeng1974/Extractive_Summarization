@entity0 could have written his name in the @entity3 history books as the club 's first @entity5 goalscorer on their continental debut			1
instead , he inked an unwanted entry as the player guilty of perhaps their worst - ever @entity10 tied goalless on the hour during their @entity13 third - round qualifier with @entity14 in the @entity16 city of @entity17 , @entity3 won a penalty when @entity19 was tripped inside the area			1
subs ( not used ) : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			0
@entity3 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity56 6 ; @entity57 6 , @entity58 8 , @entity59 6 ; @entity60 6 , @entity0 5 , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 65 , 6 ) , @entity63 7 , @entity64 7 ; @entity65 5 ( @entity66 65 , 6 ) , @entity19 7 ( @entity67 86 , 5 ) subs ( not used ) : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72			1
booked : @entity0 , @entity63 , @entity57 referee : @entity74 ( @entity75 ) man - of - the - match : @entity58 attendance : 8 , 254 @entity3 ratings from @entity79 's @entity78 @entity0 's tame effort was kept out by @entity37 but the midfielder was presented with a shot at redemption when the ball rebounded into his path			1
but with an open net to aim at the former @entity88 man somehow contrived to volley against the top of the crossbar from just six yards and his sorry strike cannoned into the disbelieving 600 away fans behind the goal			2
manager @entity94 said : ' from where i was sat it was easier to score ( the rebound )			2
you would put your house on him to score ( the penalty ) though			2
' we 've missed the last three or four now , so we best start practising them			0
' @entity65 , @entity61 and @entity19 all headed over the crossbar in the first half from good positions but the hosts were the better side after the break			0
it leaves the @entity110 with a nervy second leg at the @entity112 next thursday , and @entity58 â€“ who handed second - half debuts to @entity66 and @entity62 - added : ' i knew it would be difficult especially as we 're in middle of pre-season			1
watching on : @entity94 and his coaching staff overseeing the action high flyer : @entity60 risest highest for the ball against @entity124 's @entity123 ' they were technically very good and have dangerous players on the counter-attack			0
' but one thing you have to do is take chances when they come your way			0
' we 've had one or two great opportunities and that would have made the second leg more comfortable			0
' but , overall , we will be better for it because this was our first competitive game			1
' @entity139 : @entity141 2 - 0 @entity140			0

@entity3 settle for goalless draw on competitive @entity5 debut
@entity0 has second half penalty saved and misses rebound
the midfielder took to @entity150 to *apologise* to fans after the game
@entity110 will now need a result in second leg at home next thursday
