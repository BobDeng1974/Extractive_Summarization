@entity10 had always wanted to build a tree house for his sons			2
he got the chance last summer after moving into a @entity14 home with a big tree in the front yard			1
two months later , he received his first notice from the city to tear it down because it is a threat to public safety and overhangs a public sidewalk			2
alternatively , city officials said , the tree house can remain , but only if @entity10 takes out a $ 1 million insurance policy			1
tree change : @entity10 with one of his sons in their tree house at their home in @entity14 , @entity4 family 's tree : @entity10 says he 's not violating any city codes with the tree house he built for his sons the @entity33 reports officials say the treehouse overhangs the sidewalk , threatening public safety			1
' if something happens , the city is liable for the damages , ' mayor @entity38 told the @entity42			0
' the council was unanimous in directing me to do what we 're doing			0
it has to come down			0
' @entity10 says he 's being ' harassed ' by the city , and that he is not in violation of any codes			2
from on high : the city council has asked @entity10 to take down the structure , but he refuses branching out : @entity10 built the tree house himself , and says he spoke to an engineer before he began construction secure : the tree house is secured to the tree with large bolts and cables that can support 800lb city codes forbid obstructing sidewalks , but @entity10 says there 's nothing in the rulebook about obstructing the air 30 feet above the sidewalk			1
city officials say @entity10 could keep the tree house if he takes out a $ 1 million insurance policy , an idea @entity10 says is preposterous			1
' a million dollars ? for a tree house ? ' he told the @entity42			2
' come on ! ' in response to @entity10 's refusal to take down the tree house , the city is planning to have an engineer evaluate the integrity of the structure and then obtain a court order to have the tree house taken down			1
if the city has to forcibly remove the tree house , city attorney @entity82 says @entity10 will be hit with a bill for the city 's legal costs , the engineer 's evaluation and the removal of the structure			1
million - dollar tree house : the city says that if @entity10 does n't take the tree house down , they will have someone forcibly remove it and send the bill to him ' i hate to do that , ' @entity82 said			1
' we 've sent him lots of warning letters			0
if he 'd just take it down , we could avoid all that			0
' @entity10 says the treehouse is perfectly safe and that he conferred with an engineer before building it			0
there are about 10 bolts anchoring the house to the tree and a cable system rated to 800lb supporting it			0
' how can they take me to court over an obstruction that does n't exist ? ' he asked			0
' i do n't want to fight over this			0
i just think it 's ridiculous that they are going after a tree house			0
