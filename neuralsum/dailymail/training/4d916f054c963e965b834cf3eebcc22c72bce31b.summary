six months have passed since @entity0 arrived at @entity1 for £ 35million and one nagging question remains : what do you think they were smoking over there at the @entity7 ? people are entitled to the occasional mistake — @entity10 lost his place for taking a crafty puff on a cigarette , for example — but @entity15 ’s is on another level			1
with every passing week , with every goal and every assist in the colours of @entity1 , the decision to sell the @entity18 last summer becomes more absurd			1

click here to read more from our brilliant @entity95 service @entity0 made the first and scored two himself here , drifting between brilliant and sublime in this rhythmic destruction of @entity24			1
@entity1 were interrupted , at times , by @entity24 ’s agricultural approach and their willingness to look for a fight at every opportunity			1
what the visitors got in return was a football lesson			0
@entity0 operated at a different pace to those around him			2
in this kind of form he can play wherever he wants			0
he has now scored 12 goals and engineered another seven in the @entity26 since he said his goodbyes to @entity114 and @entity115			0
@entity1 , gathering momentum now , used the cushion of a three - goal lead to bring @entity55 and @entity119 from the substitutes ’ bench in the second half			1
they are still a little way off , but when @entity1 play on the front foot like this , a team full of conviction and purpose , @entity63 can afford to wait a bit longer for them			2
@entity46 , who was selected ahead of @entity10 , celebrates @entity1 's first goal @entity1 legends @entity132 ( centre ) and @entity134 ( right ) look on as their former team take on @entity24 at the @entity34 @entity1 's @entity47 ( left ) clashes with @entity24 's @entity76 during the first half @entity76 shows concern for @entity47 shortly after pushing the @entity36 in the back the 29 - year - old was treated for six minutes before being substituted in the first half , suffering a suspected dislocate shoulder @entity0 was mesmerising , waiting patiently for @entity30 to sprint back into the penalty area when the @entity1 defender had served him with the chance to set up the opener			1
@entity0 paused , checking his movement until he could find @entity30 and then looked on with a good deal of satisfaction as the @entity36 directed his header beyond @entity64			1
he scored a beauty in the 33rd minute , collecting @entity51 ’s pass on the edge of the area and gliding past the outstretched legs in @entity24 ’s defence			0
the finish was top - quality , deceiving @entity64 and the rest of the @entity24 defence by giving it the eyes before opting to drill his effort inside the keeper ’s near post			0
he deserved full marks for improvisation			0
this was a decent response by @entity1 , putting the midweek trauma of @entity10 ’s censure behind them with a performance full of conviction			2
@entity46 is first choice between the sticks for the time being — and he kept his second successive clean sheet			0
the reality is he only had two saves to make here			0
@entity1 controlled this game , adding a third when @entity0 ’s 49th - minute free - kick somehow made it through the wall and into the back of @entity64 ’s net			1
there was also another side to this game , a knock - on effect of @entity1 ’s 3 - 2 defeat at the @entity189 on december 6			1
@entity47 will be out for a good few weeks , nursing a dislocated shoulder after @entity76 shoved him into the advertising hoardings			1
‘ i did n’t see it , ’ claimed @entity24 manager @entity84			0
amazingly , @entity63 said the same			0
‘ 1 - 0 to the football team , ’ chimed @entity1 supporters as @entity47 was carried off for an x-ray — and it was hard to disagree			1
@entity24 captain @entity66 and @entity1 forward @entity40 squabbled repeatedly , childishly holding each other ’s shirts throughout			2
@entity54 ( right ) of @entity1 races away from @entity72 and @entity67 @entity0 curls the ball around the legs of @entity66 to score his first of the afternoon and put @entity1 into a 2 - 0 the former @entity15 man continued his run of brilliant form with an assist and a goal during the first 45 minutes @entity77 also escaped when referee @entity87 failed to spot the @entity24 forward elbow @entity50 in the side of the head when they collided mid-air			1
had @entity0 not put this game well beyond @entity24 , it certainly had the potential to spill over			2
instead , @entity1 cruised in the second half			1
the 3 - 0 lead gave @entity63 the opportunity to field @entity55 , sending him on to replace @entity54 with just over 20 minutes left			1
he should have scored when @entity0 put him through , racing away from @entity67 and @entity68 before skewing his effort wide of @entity64 ’s far post			2
@entity0 has now scored 12 @entity26 goals following his double on sunday afternoon @entity119 dusted off the cobwebs as well , making his first appearance in the team since rupturing knee ligaments in the defeat at @entity227 in october			1
a dissatisfied @entity40 made way and it seemed to make sense when he went and sat out the final 18 minutes of this victory alongside the brooding figure of @entity10			0
it will take some time for @entity119 to get up to full speed again and @entity63 admitted it could be two or three weeks before the @entity236 winner is ready to start			2
this appearance was a taster , a reminder of the good life at @entity1 after such a long period spent on the sidelines			1
by the time the @entity244 international was on for @entity40 , the damage had been done because @entity0 had put this game way beyond the limited ambitions of this @entity24 side			2
the man who cost a packet when he moved from @entity15 continues to leave everybody short of breath			0
@entity253 want to sign @entity254 on loan this week , despite the @entity36 missing a medical on friday			0
the @entity1 striker was booked for the procedure at the end of last week but did n’t show up , leaving the move in jeopardy			2
however , @entity253 are still hopeful of getting the deal over the line this week , with boss @entity264 keen to bolster his strikeforce			0
@entity1 will ramp up their interest in @entity268 midfielder @entity267 this week			2
@entity267 is a £ 16million target for the @entity42 and said yesterday : ‘ if ( @entity63 ) @entity63 calls , i ’ll have a man - to - man discussion with him and then we ’ll see			1
@entity1 has always been the club of my heart			0
’ travel chaos meant @entity24 fans had a nightmare journey home			0
a problem between @entity277 and @entity278 affected trains from @entity281 station in @entity32			0
their defeated team , who have never won at the @entity34 in any competition in seven attempts , travelled home by coach			0
stat of the day - @entity1 have won their last 13 home games against @entity24 @entity24 defender @entity66 confronts @entity42 forward @entity40 during the @entity26 clash on sunday @entity294 rugby star @entity293 was also in attendance at the @entity34 to watch @entity1 collect three points @entity76 grabs the shirt of @entity51 ( left ) during a disappoiting first half for the away side the 26 - year - old fires @entity63 's side into a 3 - 0 lead with a 20 - yard free - kick during the early stages of the second half the @entity18 's effort squirmed through the legs of @entity65 before trickling over the line @entity64 fails to stop @entity0 's second half free - kick which hit the post before rebounding across the line @entity0 now has 17 goals and nine assists to his name since signing for @entity1 in the summer @entity244 midfielder @entity119 made his first appearance for three months after coming on for @entity40 in the 72nd minute			1
