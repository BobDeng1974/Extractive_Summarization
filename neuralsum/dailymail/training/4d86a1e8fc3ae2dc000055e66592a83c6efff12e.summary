by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity3 ’s chairman @entity2 took a bucket of ice over the head in the morning and @entity7 absorbed a humiliating slap across the face in the night			1
some of their players might yet land a worse treatment still			2
that certainly seemed the logical assumption as @entity7 vented his anger after the game			1
make no mistake , this competition was not his burning priority			2
that much was obvious from the fact he made nine changes to his starting line - up from the @entity26 fixture at the weekend , when @entity3 lost their second @entity28 match in two			1
subs not used : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60			2
booked : @entity49 , @entity52 goal : @entity32 77 ' @entity3 : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ( @entity69 59 ' ) , @entity70 ( @entity71 81 ' ) , @entity72 ( @entity73 78 ' ) , @entity72 , @entity40			1
subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78			2
booked : @entity63 referee : @entity80 ( @entity81 ) att : 3,999 but no top - flight manager wants to see his side lose to a @entity85 club ; no player wants to hear that they might be considered ‘ lucky ’ to be at a @entity28 club , as per @entity7 ’s post-match message			1
yet the reality is this was an upset in name only			2
by deeds , @entity37 deserved to win , long before @entity32 scored a brilliant free - kick in the 77th minute			1
encouragement will be in short supply for @entity3 now , except arguably for the inclusion and sporadic bursts from @entity40 , back at the club and making his first start in 16 months			1
for the rest of them , @entity7 had only anger			1
he said : ‘ i do n’t regret it ( his selection )			2
we have a massive game again on saturday ( against @entity110 )			0
you give lads a chance to play and obviously there are an awful lot of lads at @entity28 clubs who are lucky to be there			0
’ he added : ‘ we gave the lads who have n’t been playing an opportunity to show what they can and they showed me what they can do			0
it was n’t an awful lot			0
‘ it was only @entity40 who did himself any good			0
there were n’t too many other pluses			0
’ @entity37 manager @entity131 said : ‘ it was absolutely amazing , they were brilliant in everything they did			2
i thought we deserved it			0
‘ @entity7 's priority is the @entity28 but for a small club like ourselves there is always an opportunity if they rest players			1
’ @entity37 were excellent from the start			0
@entity32 hit a volley on the turn that dipped dangerously in front of @entity62			1
not looking good : @entity146 ( left ) and @entity40 wait to restart after going 1 - 0 down the goalkeeper saved , but was beaten after six minutes when @entity52 found space on the left and drilled low across goal			2
the shot went past @entity62 and narrowly wide			0
@entity40 repeatedly looked for openings in retaliation , surging into a few gaps that existed and charging anyway when they did n’t			0
if nothing else , he gets people excited , even when he is flapping his arm at team - mates who , for one reason or another , have not lived up to his expectations			2
his shot that skidded wide was @entity3 ’s only decent effort of the first 20 minutes			1
@entity37 , meanwhile , were increasing the pressure			0
@entity53 shot straight at @entity62 from close range – a superb chance – and then @entity52 shot wide			0
would the misses prove costly ? tackle : @entity171 attempts to take the ball away from @entity53 during a goalless first half strength : @entity70 fends off @entity51 during the @entity176 second round clash it looked that way in the 22nd minute when @entity67 rattled a shot against the bar , but again the hosts surged on the half hour when @entity52 clattered his way through a challenge and drew a good save from @entity62			1
@entity3 responded with a perfect floated pass to @entity67 , who lobbed the defender and then attempted to lob @entity44 , but the shot landed on the roof of the net			1
it would have been a special goal			0
@entity48 rounded off a frantic first half with a huge hit that deflected wide and @entity32 opened the second half with a header over the bar			1
@entity3 ’s agitation on the pitch and their bench was obvious			1
@entity199 , @entity7 ’s coach and touchline enforcer , was fuming and at one point took it out on @entity131 , the @entity37 manager			1
the second half was not nearly so frantic or exciting			0
there were openings and tussles , but not much of either			0
@entity40 ’s burst all but dried up			0
then @entity171 clattered harness and @entity32 nailed the free - kick from 20 yards			1
it was what both sides deserved			0
@entity211 : former @entity213 winger @entity212 looks to get away from @entity52			0

@entity33 knock @entity3 out of the @entity176
@entity32 scores brilliant 77th minute free - kick
@entity7 's side *struggled* to impose themselves
