by @entity0 published : 00:47 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 00:51 est , 2 march 2014 two siblings from @entity3 , @entity4 have an extraordinary dance routine that is gaining international attention			1
even though @entity8 , 9 , uses a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy and cystic fibrosis , that does n't stop her and her sister @entity13 , 11 , from competing at the @entity14 and becoming an instant darling among fans			1
in fact , both @entity17 and @entity18 incorporate wheelchairs in their heart - warming routine set to the song ' reflection ' from popular @entity27 film @entity25			1
' there was n't a dry eye in the house , ' @entity14 representative @entity48 said of their unique performance			2
@entity53 was the first time the girls appeared on a national stage and they made quite the impression			0
' within a second , everyone became a family , ' @entity58 said to @entity62			0
the girls ' mom @entity63 told @entity62 that @entity18 picks all her songs and that the lyrics , ' i am now in a world where i have to hide my heart and what i believe in , but somehow i will show the world what 's inside my heart and be loved for who i am , ' describes the way @entity18 struggles with her disability but how she overcomes it			2
in the performance , @entity17 does n't push @entity18 around , rather @entity18 is able to operate her own motorized wheelchair on which she can twirl and dance			1
the girls show the national audience how they 've manged to master their ability as @entity18 twirls in her chair , @entity17 does impressive flips in the air @entity18 does not see herself as disabled and wants people to believe in themselves despite what other people may view as limitations			1
the sisters study at a dance studio where @entity18 takes both private and group lessons			0
@entity18 teaches others how to reveal who they are on the inside not through physical appearance but through art and creativity			0
the routine begins with both @entity18 and her sister @entity17 sitting in wheelchairs looking at each other from opposite sides			1
eventually , @entity17 rises from her wheelchair , dances through the mirror to the other side and acts as @entity17 's inner self full of enthusiasm and exuberance			2
@entity17 spins , pops her leg into the air , and even flips on the stage in front of the massive and appreciative audience			0
the girls spin hand in hand on the stage until @entity17 walks back through the mirror for the grand finale			2
even though @entity18 may never be able to kick her legs , it does n't make her feel any less special on the inside especially with the love of her mother , her older sister , and her adoring fans			0
their touching routine was undeniably a showstopper the girls , pictured here with their parents and their little brother , love performing together and working together to create art			0
