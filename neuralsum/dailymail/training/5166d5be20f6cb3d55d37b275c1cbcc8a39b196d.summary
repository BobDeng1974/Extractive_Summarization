by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 09:06 est , 11 october 2012 live pipe organ music is evocative of old @entity3 glamour and silent movies , but has long been absent from @entity6 cinemas , until now			1
the only @entity8 organ in a working cinema in @entity10 has made its debut after a painstaking five - year restoration , much to the delight of cinema goers			1
enthusiasts from across the country descended on the @entity17 in @entity18 - on - @entity19 , @entity20 , at the weekend to witness a piece of history			1
it was used occasionally at the @entity44 in @entity45 until the 1970s			1
mayor of @entity47 cut the ribbon at the weekend to unveil the instrument			1
@entity50 , who launched the restoration , said : ' at some points i never thought we would get this far , so it ’s tremendous to see it playing - it sounds fantastic			1
' people have come here from the south coast to @entity61 and everywhere in between			2
' visitors were treated to an afternoon concert featuring organists @entity64 , @entity34 and @entity66			2
organs took the place of orchestras in the heyday of silent films , designed to produce many different sounds and timbres using the fewest number of pipes to minimise the space needed			2
the restored @entity8 has the traditional horse - shoe shaped console and sits in pride of place on the right hand side of the screen at the royalty cinema			2
nostalgic : mr @entity34 played the same organ over 40 years ago at the @entity45 bingo hall , and said the event in @entity20 had brought back memories for him tickling the ivories : @entity66 entertained guests on the pipe organ that produces a surprising variety of sounds , including that of a siren describing the opening event as ‘ fantastic ’ , @entity96 , of @entity97 , said : ' i could have listened to the organ for hours			1
' it was so good and it ’s wonderful to see the organ being used			0
i am glad i came			0
' the celebration continued with an evening showing of silent film @entity33 , accompanied by mr @entity34 on the organ			0
he said being involved brought back some memories for him			1
' i played this very same organ 40 years ago so it ’s nostalgic for me - i used to play it in an @entity45 bingo hall			1
i ’d entertain the ladies before bingo so it ’s nice to be playing it again			0
' piece of history : the performance of @entity34 ( pictured ) and the other organists , was the first time many of the cinema enthusiasts would have heard the organ live there were also shorter films to start the cinema evening , which included the likes of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , with @entity130 at the keyboard			0
one of those chuckling at the comedians , @entity132 , from @entity133 , said : ' this is the first time i have seen a @entity8 in action so i was very excited			0
i ’ve heard them on cds but nothing compares to seeing it live			0
' everyone has been laughing so it must be good , and the organists are so talented			0
' @entity146 , of @entity97 , who attended the concert and film show , said : ' the concert was very good and i am surprised at how many people turned up			0
' i ’ve seen the organ over the years so it ’s lovely to come and see it being played , especially in a setting like this because there are not many vintage cinemas about			0
