so when a tweet appeared with the headline ' @entity10 switcheroo ! @entity3 has grown bitter , more vengeful with the years , ' it was somewhat legitimately assumed that their account had been hacked			1
but two @entity15 officials today said the site had not been hacked , and that the reason for the unusual posting was an ' internal system failure ' due to a non-native @entity21 speaker posting the story on the website			0
raised interest : a story about @entity3 running on one of the @entity6 's main @entity5 accounts and the website of its communications office raising concerns it might have been hacked @entity3 link : the @entity5 link went through to this webpage ' admittedly some people might have been thrown off by the headline , ' said @entity6 communications adviser @entity38			1
the tweet went through to the website of the @entity41 which was running at story with the headline ' @entity44 : @entity3 has grown bitter , more vengeful with the years			1
' monsignor @entity45 , the no. 2 in the @entity6 's social communications office , said the office 's website , runs stories about communications issues and regularly takes copy from @entity53 , the news agency of the @entity54			1

meanwhile today pope @entity65 called for more dialogue with @entity72 and offered an olive branch to @entity101 and other countries that do n't have diplomatic relations with the @entity6			1
strong words : @entity65 said it was important to intensify dialogue among different religions ' particularly dialogue with @entity72 ' vision : the @entity65 advocated more interaction between different faiths as a means of promoting peace delivery : in his first foreign policy address as pope , @entity65 delivered his remarks in @entity118 rather than the traditional @entity119 in his first foreign policy address as pope , @entity65 delivered his remarks in @entity118 rather than the traditional @entity119 - another indication that the @entity123 - born pope is less than comfortable speaking languages other than @entity118 and his mother - tongue @entity126			0
the occasion was an audience with ambassadors from the 180 countries that have diplomatic relations with the @entity6 , in which @entity65 explained he would work for peace , the poor and to " build bridges " between peoples			1
he noted that even his title " pontiff " means bridge - builder			0

' and in 2011 , the pre-eminent institute of @entity72 learning in the @entity169 , @entity166 's @entity148 institute , froze dialogue with the @entity6 to protest @entity158 's call for greater protection of @entity173 in @entity174			2
however , the @entity6 said friday that @entity148 's chief imam , @entity147 , sent a message of congratulations to @entity65 for his election and hoped for cooperation			2
that 's a possible sign of a thaw in relations with the arrival of a pope whose interfaith outreach while archbishop of @entity185 has been well - documented			0

@entity158 had made improving relations with @entity101 a priority , given the millions of faithful who belong to @entity101 's underground @entity210 , but tensions remain particularly over the appointment of bishops			0
@entity101 insists on naming them , while the @entity6 says only the pope can name bishops			2
