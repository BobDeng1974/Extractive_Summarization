an investigation has concluded @entity2 broke his neck after falling head - first into the back of the police van as it was moving , it was reported today			1
medical and law enforcement sources briefed on the police investigation told @entity10 's ' catastrophic ' head injuries were consistent with hitting a bolt ' in the back door of the van '			1
they claimed there was ' no evidence ' @entity2 sustained a fatal spine injury during his arrest , which was caught on camera on a street side on april 12			1
according to @entity10 's sources , @entity2 was standing in the van , bent over with his hand cuffed behind his back and his head pointing towards the back door			1
it is believed he fell into the door , breaking his neck			2
it was picked up by a privately - owned security camera according to the latest police press conference , these are the stops the van made transporting @entity2 the news comes hours after @entity60 admitted the van transporting @entity2 made a previously unreported stop			1
the mysterious detail was picked up by a privately - owned security camera , and will be integral to the police investigation into @entity2 's death , which was completed and handed to the state prosecutor on thursday morning			1
it is not known why the van stopped at the corner of @entity71 and @entity72 before it made another two stops then finally transported @entity2 to the hospital			1
and police have yet to clarify why @entity2 would have been standing without a seat belt on			2
just nine days before his arrest , the @entity60 issued a new policy , making it obligatory to belt all inmates placed in the back of a transport van			2
@entity83 : police commissioner @entity84 revealed a private security camera captured the van making an unknown stop			1
he refused to elaborate on the details of the new information police commissioner @entity84 refused to elaborate on the new information			1
he said the contents of the report , which was completed and handed to the @entity92 at 8.50am thursday , will remain confidential as they continue to investigate			1
six officers have been suspended with pay over the incident , and the department has admitted @entity2 - who was asthmatic - should have been given the medical help he requested			2
the report that @entity2 fell inside the van corroborates claims he was given a ' rough ride ' by the van driver , who is the only officer yet to deliver a statement to the investigators , according to @entity10			1
the van in which @entity2 was injured is a @entity107 - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the ' @entity111 ' van driven by @entity112			2
as the police department , mayor 's office , and state prosecutors refuse to address the development , it has done nothing but fuel anger and speculation surrounding the circumstances of @entity2 's arrest more than two weeks ago			1
a relative of one of the suspended police officers told @entity127 she believes @entity2 was injured during his arrest outside the van			1
her family member , she said , was based inside the van , and she fears he will be made a scapegoat for something he ' did n't do '			2
however , this theory is at odds with the medical examiner 's report which allegedly found @entity2 sustained injuries by falling over inside the van , where he had been placed without a seat belt			1
the woman , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , told @entity127 her family member was in the van with @entity2 as he screamed and cried for medical help			2
but she believes the spinal injury which led to @entity2 's death was inflicted earlier , during his arrest on april 12			1
in an appeal that echoes @entity2 's family , she is calling for the police department to conduct a thorough investigation that will determine which of the six suspended police officers dealt the fatal blow			1
' six officers did not injure this man , ' she told @entity157			0
secret stop : this is the corner where the police van was spotted making a previously unreported stop these are the security cameras outside a grocery which picked up the secret stop @entity167 's convenience store 's camera footage revealed a new stop the police van made while transporting @entity2 ' six officers did n't put him in the hospital			1
' i 'm worried that instead of them figuring out who did , that six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to @entity2			2
' her words came after a police document was leaked to the @entity180 , in which the other prisoner in the transport van with @entity2 said he could hear the 25 - year - old slamming himself against the wall			2
the prisoner speculated that @entity2 was trying to hurt himself			0
in the documents , the unidentified prisoner says he was loaded into a police van after @entity2 on april 12 , and apparently told investigators that he heard @entity2 ' banging against the walls ' and ' intentionally trying to injure himself '			1
however , he admits he could not see what @entity2 was doing , since they were separated by a metal partition			0
the statement was cited in a warrant to search an arresting officer 's clothing for possible traces of @entity2 's dna			1
the van in which @entity2 was injured is a @entity107 - the same model of vehicle which has been modified into the ' @entity111 ' van driven by @entity112 the assertion that @entity2 may have caused his own death in the back of the police van was quickly rejected by an attorney hired by his family			1

' we question the accuracy of the police reports we 've seen thus far , including the police report that says mr @entity2 was arrested without force or incident			1
