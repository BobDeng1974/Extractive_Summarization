needing help : more than 2,100 women have been treated in @entity3 hospitals since 2010 for female genital mutilation injuries more than 2,100 victims of female genital mutilation have been treated in @entity3 hospitals since 2010 , it emerged today			1
almost 300 women needed surgery to help them recover from the brutal ritual , new figures have revealed			1
among those treated in the capital 's hospitals included 12 children , including one girl who had been left with an ' open wound ' following the criminal act			1
despite being illegal in the @entity20 , female genital mutilation is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 women dealing with the after - effects and more than 20,000 young girls thought to be at risk			1
the procedure is associated with communities in @entity28 , particularly @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , as well as some parts of the @entity34			2
many girls living in @entity20 are taken to these countries for be ' cut ' , and some will be as young as five			1
but it is becoming more prevalent in the @entity20 and experts say today 's figures are ' truly shocking ' but there are ' far more victims ' than the data shows			1
in the majority of cases the clitoris is removed because it gives sexual pleasure			1
a total of 2,115 @entity49 patients were seen between 2010 and now , the @entity50 has revealed			2
dr @entity51 , a specialist in dealing with these injuries at @entity53 , said : ' these statistics show a very significant number of women are being treated for @entity49			1
' but there are still lots out there who are not being identified because they do n’t know where to go for help , are n’t being referred by @entity63 or are too scared to come forward			2

nine - year old @entity71 pictured days after undergoing @entity49 at home in @entity73 ( right ) @entity74 was just seven years old when she was taken to @entity30 for a ' holiday ' where she would be subjected to the horrific procedure			2
' there was a woman at the door in a burka			2
i was scared and instinctively started running			0
when i was caught , i was taken into a room filled with instruments i did n't recognise , ' she said			0
' the woman i was so afraid of was there waiting for me			0
she scolded me for running away , telling me how difficult it was to obtain equipment like this ; how ungrateful i was			0
' i blacked out before she started cutting			0
i 'm still not sure whether it was the anaesthetic or pure fear '			0
when @entity92 woke , she was in agony with her legs bound together			0
taken back to the @entity20 two days later , @entity92 found that friends and teachers were unwilling to take her story seriously , leaving her feeling let down and alone			1
' i ’m really worried about girls , in particular			0
where are they going to seek help ? the @entity63 who are their first point of call often do n’t have the knowledge			0
we also need teachers and lecturers to do more to at least signpost girls towards help			0
' @entity74 was seven when she underwent @entity49 in @entity30 and now campaigns against it through her charity daughters of eve			0
' for too long , it has been passed off as a " cultural " ritual			1
but this act is not about celebration			0
@entity49 is gender - based violence , it 's as simple as that , ' she said			0
it came as director of public @entity124 said it was ' only a matter of time ' before there is a prosecution for female genital mutilation			1
' i think a prosecution is much closer now than it 's been at any stage since this was made a criminal offence in this country , ' he said			1
' we have devised a strategy , and we have now got the intelligence - led operations that are bringing us very close to a prosecution			1
' i do not think that 's a failure - that is trying to grapple with a difficult problem			0
if it was easy there would have been a prosecution			2
