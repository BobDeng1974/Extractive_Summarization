dismembered : an @entity9 policeman ( right ) inspects the scene next to the body of @entity5 ( bottom left ) his dismembered body was later found by the tigers ' water trough , police said			1
mr @entity5 and his wife had cared for the tigers since the small animal sanctuary was closed down in 2010 at the peak of the economic crisis			1

the retired zoo keeper was ‘ utterly fearless ’ and devoted to the animals according to reports in the @entity9 media			1
on tuesday night , he went in to the cage to feed them chicken meatballs			0
but this time the alpha - male , named @entity38 , went in for the kill quickly followed by two others in the pack			2
five recently born cubs watched hungrily from the sidelines			2
the elderly keeper was dragged through the dirt to a clearing and torn to pieces			1
after hearing desperate screams his wife @entity48 called for medics			2
tigers rest in their enclosure at the private park in @entity54 , @entity8 , where @entity5 was attacked but the 73 - year - old , who walked with the help of two sticks , was powerless to come to her husband 's aid and could only watch in agony from outside the cage			1
even after the ambulance arrived it was half an hour before the medics could get close to him			0
the tiger that attacked first was the one he loved the most , according to reports , even though the same animal had attacked him before two years ago causing him to spend eight months in hospital			2
at the time the faithful owner blamed himself , saying he was wearing aftershave which had confused the animal			0
it was a miracle ’ that he had survived , he said			2
even yesterday mrs @entity74 still refused to blame the tigers , telling reporters : ‘ my husband and @entity38 did not get on			2
if i had gone it would never have happened			0
’ but neighbours said the animals were malnourished and aggressive			0
they were fed just twice a week			0
the couple had always been big cat lovers and originally kept both tigers and leopards at a villa outside @entity8 where they had a big garden			1
after problems with neighbours they were evicted and the cats were almost put down			0
but at the last minute the owner of an animal sanctuary called the @entity94 came to their rescue offering them space at his park			0
the tourists would be able to see the tigers but the couple had to take care of their maintenance themselves , he said			1
@entity105 said that he had taken them in because he had sympathised with their plight			0
he told @entity9 newspaper @entity109 : ’ they said that the animals were their lives			1
‘ even though they were elderly and physically debilitated , i did not want to be responsible for separating them from their animals			0
’ a keeper who had worked at the animal sanctuary said mr @entity5 was ‘ very sure of himself			1
’ he told the newspaper @entity119 : ‘ he never took any precautions			0
he went in , he gave them their food and he left			0
he had no fear , even though in the past he had been attacked by the same tigers			1
’ then in 2010 mounting bills and dwindling numbers of visitors forced the closure of the zoo			1
new homes were found for the animals			0
the only ones to stay were the tigers , as well as one old leopard , now 24 years old			0
@entity5 was attacked as he entered the enclosure at a closed - down zoo , near @entity8 , in northern @entity9 the couple had continued to care for them with love and a few families continued to trickle up the hill to see the big cats			1
but local residents and animal activists were concerned by the keepers ’ advancing age and the aggressive nature of the tigers , who appeared skinny and malnourished			2
after the first attack on mr @entity5 two years ago many believed the animals were dangerous			2
a few months ago five tiger cubs were born bringing the total number of tigers to feed to ten			0
finally , last week mr @entity5 was asked to meet the mayor but the council was struggling to find a suitable home for the animals			2
they are currently in the care of vets while their fate is decided			0
