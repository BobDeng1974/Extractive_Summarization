by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 1 june 2013 they battled it out for the @entity5 title over the last two years			0
and it seems that neighbouring clubs @entity7 and @entity9 are also top of the table when it comes to ripping off fans over replica football kits			2
stunned parents have hit out at the two @entity5 clubs after it emerged their children ’s strips have crossed the £ 100 barrier for the first time			1
rip - off ? @entity9 stars parade their team 's new @entity23 home strip , which costs more than £ 100 for the child 's version expensive : next season 's @entity7 kit , left , and @entity9 's latest strip , right			1
they are the only two @entity5 clubs to charge over £ 50 for adult shirts parents have blasted both clubs and strip manufacturer @entity23 , with some saying they will refuse to shell out the sum			1
it is the first time the price for an entire mini replica football kit - consisting of shirt , shorts , socks , @entity5 badge on the sleeve and name on the back - has crossed the three figure barrier			2
@entity9 season ticket - holder @entity46 , 42 , recently paid £ 109 for a full kit with the name of footballer ‘ @entity50 ’ on the back			0
last season 's @entity7 child 's kit - the cost of the new strip is likely to smash the £ 100 barrier mr @entity46 , a revenue manager from @entity58 , @entity59 , branded the price ‘ ridiculous ’ and said the clubs were putting parents ’ under immense financial strain			1
he said : ‘ it ’s a massive increase on last year			0
i know they have invested a lot in the team but this is silly			0
they [ children ] want to look like the players so they want a name on their backs and the @entity5 badge on the sleeve			0
‘ they would have it on their backs every day so it would n’t last			0
’ mr @entity46 , added : ‘ the ticket prices for kids are great and by all means make money from merchandising , but not like this			0
‘ i probably could afford it but i have to draw the line somewhere			0
£ 109 for an 11 - year - old ’s kit is ridiculous			2
’ adult shirts , priced at £ 55 , are also the most expensive in the @entity5 with @entity7 and @entity9 the only two teams in the @entity5 to charge more than £ 50			1
last season ’s @entity9 shirt , made by @entity92 , retailed for around £ 44 - meaning this year ’s is up by more than 24 per cent			1
@entity7 ’s shirt was £ 50 , meaning the increase is 10 per cent			1
@entity95 are the other top - four team to bring out a new home shirt			0
manufactured by @entity98 , their shirt retails for £ 49.99			2
it is understood that @entity100 , whose kit is also made by @entity23 , will be releasing a new away strip with price details to come in the next fortnight			1
@entity106 have also released details of their new home jersey			0
the traditional red number , made by @entity111 firm @entity110 , costs £ 45			0
laughing all the way to the bank : city striker @entity115 's facial expression probably mirrors the club 's money men , who are raking in £ 109 from parents for the new child 's strip up until recently clubs only changed their two shirts - home and away - in alternate seasons			1
but that now appears to be a thing of the past with many producing three or four different shirts which they change every year			0
this is the first time @entity23 have made a @entity9 strip after they signed a six - year deal reported to be worth £ 72m with the club			1
@entity7 are said to earn £ 23.5m a year from their agreement with the same company which expires at the end of the new season			0
the @entity138 are currently negotiating a new deal with @entity23			2
the high price of supporting a football club has been a long - standing complaint among fans			0
not only do season tickets now cost more than £ 1,000 in some cases , but the clubs usually charge a fee for the right just to be on the waiting list to obtain season tickets			1
costly : @entity7 striker @entity151 is an idol for thousands of fans , who want to have his name on the back of their shirts , which costs even more money in 2003 , @entity92 , the @entity159 , @entity7 and six sports chains were fined more than £ 16 million by the @entity161 for colluding to inflate the price of football shirts			2
a @entity9 spokesman revealed that the shirts were actually £ 5 cheaper than the suggested price of £ 60 - which is what the new @entity169 shirt , also made by @entity23 , is selling for			1
he said : ‘ the cost reflects value to the consumer through design , innovation , development , manufacturing , and retailing			0
@entity179 are pricing the adult shirt £ 5 cheaper than the @entity181			1
’ a spokesman for @entity7 said that pricing was an issue for @entity23			2
a @entity23 spokesman said : ‘ the kits contain innovative performance technologies that have a certain amount of r&d costs and although the retailer sets the prices of the kit , we feel the £ 60 suggested retail price for the adult shirt and £ 42 @entity181 for the kids ’ shirt represents good value given the level of technology and design which goes into it			1

parents are left *fuming* and brand price ' ridiculous '
cost of adult city shirt hiked by 24 per cent to £ 55
