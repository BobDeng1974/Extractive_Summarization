snake bites just got a tiny bit less scary			0
a team of @entity4 scientists has developed a cutting - edge blood test that could dramatically reduce the time it takes to treat victims nipped by venomous reptiles			1
the researchers have worked out a way to determine if a person has poison in their system , allowing doctors to give antivenom much earlier than at present			2
beating the bite : @entity4 scientists have developed a blood test that could dramatically reduce the time it takes to treat serious snake bites importantly , the test could protect people from irreversible nerve damage which results from a number of different types of snake bites			1
medical guidelines say antivenom should be given only if a person has symptoms or has positive blood results			0
however , symptoms can take up to eight hours to appear , and the current blood test takes about 12 hours , says lead researcher dr @entity34 of the @entity35			0
dr @entity34 says a one - hour bedside test could be available within a year			1
so far , his test detects venom from all poisonous snakes in @entity4 and @entity42			1
the next step is to include all snakes in the world , says dr @entity34 , who presented his research at a meeting of @entity48 in @entity49 on monday			0
@entity4 is home to most of the most dangerous snakes on the planet including the inland taipan and the notorious eastern brown snake			2
untreated , bites from these snakes result in death up to 80 per cent of the time and can kill in hours			0

@entity4 researches develop a test that *rapidly* detects *toxins*
doctors hope results will be available within one hour
they say the test will reduce the *chance* of *permanent* nerve damage
