by @entity0 the unassuming man who , over the years , drove hundreds of children in the school buses of south @entity4 was a war hero - not that any of them knew that			1
@entity7 was not the sort of man to boast			1
they had seen and done much but they kept quiet about it , even with their own families			1
so it was only after he died that , among his personal effects , mr @entity7 ’s sons found proof of his outstanding bravery in northern @entity21 in june 1940			1
the @entity23 beaches had been evacuated in the spectacular small - boat rescue of the @entity25 much hailed by @entity26 , but many thousands of soldiers who had not made it to the beaches remained in @entity21 , trying to hold off the rapidly advancing @entity30 until they could find another way home			1
war - time duty : @entity34 , left , is pictured aged 18 with colleagues just after joining the artillery			1
he too stayed tight - lipped about his wartime exploits corporal @entity38 was one of those men			1
with bombs from @entity30 planes and shells from enemy artillery exploding all around him , he drove a lorry to pick up fuel for five stranded @entity50 tanks			2
it was a mission impossible , on roads crowded with refugees and riddled with craters , but , grimly sticking to his task , he made it - an act of ‘ outstanding courage , initiative and devotion to duty ’ , according to the citation for bravery which was unearthed on his death			1
@entity7 was one of millions of ordinary , unsung @entity50 soldiers , sailors and airmen who fought their war between 1939 and 1945 with all the courage they could muster and then came home and got on with their lives , somehow burying the horrors they had experienced and quietly moving on			1
i know about him because his niece wrote to tell me after she had read an article about another soldier fighting in that same rearguard action in @entity21 : major @entity80 , the grandfather of actor @entity82			2
it was a letter like scores i have received from families in response to my writings about @entity88 ‘ @entity98 ’ was in bombers , on an @entity91 convoy , at @entity92 , d - day , @entity94 and so on , these missives would tell me , but he would never talk about it			1
‘ and now he ’s dead i will never know ’ is often the haunting refrain of those who realise one of the mainstays of their life kept a huge secret from them that it is now too late to unearth			1
derring - do : mr @entity108 , right , is pictured in 1941 , when he was a @entity109 in the @entity110 @entity111 does know what his father , @entity112 , was doing 70 years ago - but when he found out , it was a huge shock			1
as this paper reported yesterday , he discovered only on his father ’s deathbed that the genial greengrocer and later cheery pub landlord had been a pioneering member of the elite , daredevil @entity110			1
he parachuted into @entity124 territory on secret sabotage missions and escaped from two pow camps			2
his extraordinary exploits were detailed in a journal he handed to his son shortly before he died in 1986 , which is now being published			0
‘ i was filled with pride when i read it , ’ says mr @entity34			0
a military man himself , with distinguished service in the @entity136 , he was nonetheless ‘ awestruck ’ by the deeds his father described			0
rising through the ranks : in this picture mr @entity108 , right , is a sergeant in the @entity110			1
he would have killed many people as part of his service , and seen his own comrades die ‘ he was involved in some of the most famous raids during the @entity88 , and yet he ’d never mentioned a word of it			1
' at the end of the war , he closed the door on what he had done			0
he had killed many , many people and had seen his best friends killed			0
‘ but i know there was not a night that passed when he did not sit and reflect on what he had done			0
’ @entity159 was ( and still is ) emblematic of the @entity110 , and that may have been why @entity161 waited so long to unburden himself			1
for many others , however , their reluctance to talk about the war was because they felt they had wasted their youth in uniform and simply wanted to forget it			0
as one veteran told me : ‘ when i got home , i did n’t say much about what had happened to me			0
i did n’t want to burden anyone			0
all i wanted to do was go out and have fun again			0
’ he promptly met the girl who would become his wife			0
‘ we hit it off really well and were married three months later			0
i did n’t want to tell her about it			0
we had a new life of our own to lead			1
’ for many others , their years of silence were because they could not bear to let their minds go back to horrors they had experienced or because they simply thought no one would be interested			0
in 1945 , when the war ended , there was little appetite to hear someone else ’s sob story or even their tale of courage and derring - do			1
those who had fought overseas came home to a country that was rationed , blitzed and on its knees economically			1
pretty soon the struggle to survive the peace outweighed the nostalgic re-living of the glories of the war			0
heroes were two a penny , and treated as even less			0
take @entity136 sergeant @entity209 , a man of exceptional courage and integrity			0
as the leader of thousands of @entity50 inmates of a prisoner of war ( pow ) camp in remote eastern @entity30 , he had the commanding presence to shepherd his men on the notorious 500 - mile @entity219 to the west , forced on them by their @entity30 captors who were fleeing advancing @entity223 troops			1
record : @entity34 left this detailed journal to his son when he was about to die he somehow found enough food to sustain them in a barren land and , through guts and guile , negotiated them safely past trigger - happy @entity233 troops			1
when the column was accidentally strafed by our own side and 60 men were shot to pieces , he cycled and bluffed his way through the @entity30 front line , then over @entity241 to the advancing @entity50 lines to warn them to be more careful			0
and then , because he had given his word to the @entity30 who still held his men , he went back the way he had come , back into captivity			0
fellow prisoners were in awe of @entity209 ’s daring , but after the war the @entity136 scandalously had no use for him			2
he ended up as an anonymous civilian pen - pusher , afflicted by multiple sclerosis , forgotten by everyone except the hundreds of ex-pows who turned up for his funeral in 1989			1
men who had been pows in the war often kept quiet about their experiences , ashamed - for no good reason - about having been captured			1
in northern @entity21 , private @entity265 - unlike @entity7 , who escaped via @entity263 - surrendered to the @entity30 at gunpoint , but only after two weeks on the run			1
as a pow , ‘ @entity98 ’s humour and optimism kept him going through forced marches and work in @entity271 mines ’ , according to his daughter , @entity272			0
filled with pride : @entity111 , himself a military man , was ' awestruck ' to read of his father 's actions for decades , he suppressed memories of the awful times he ’d had - the crippling work , hunger , brutality - but they surfaced in the end in the saddest of ways , relived horrifically in the dementia of his old age			1
as well as the @entity286 , airmen who had fought in @entity287 also tended to keep quiet about what they had done , embarrassed by the unwarranted vitriol poured on them for the war they waged on @entity30 cities and civilians			1
but to have sat cramped inside the narrow and freezing fuselage of a @entity295 for hours on end , bucketed by winds and then battered by flak , shell - shot and shrapnel , was a test of endurance and courage , whatever the merits and morality of the mission you were sent on			2
the rear gunner was uniquely exposed , staring out into nothingness , just a thin layer of @entity314 between him and 20,000ft of thin air , the original man in a glasshouse waiting for stones to be thrown at him			0
there were so many ways to die - a bullet in the face , sucked out if the casing shattered , burnt alive if the plane caught fire , drowned if you crashed into the sea , crushed if you fell on land			2
secure : many of those who served in the war kept their experiences hidden , either in a diary like this , which belonged to mr @entity34 , or in their own memories , to be lost forever and the men who fought in aircraft knew that intimately			2
they watched planes alongside them in the formation - with mates on board - flame , droop and plunge to destruction			2
they could only pray , as they all did , they would n’t be next			0
if you were hit , you knew the chances of survival were small			0
the death rate for @entity287 crew was a chilling 50 per cent			2
and yet they went out night after night , fearing the worst , suppressing the fear			2
such men kept their thoughts to themselves			0
they did not ‘ tweet ’ their feelings to all and sundry - despite their emotions and experiences being of a profundity that shames the trivia of so much of today ’s instant communication			1
they did not shout the odds about what they had done because tomorrow they might well be dead - as their best friend probably already was - or at best maimed and scarred for life			1
and after it was all over , they kept quiet because they were just thankful to be alive			2
‘ when i look back , ’ one veteran airman told me , ‘ i remember saying that if i ever got through the war alive , i would enjoy every day of my life			2
i ’ve done a pretty good job of that			0
‘ i never thought of myself as a hero			0
a survivor , yes , not a hero			0
and lucky , damn lucky			0
’ this was a generation that went to the edge and looked over			2
those who came back were humbled by the experience - and , in this vainglorious , look - at - me 21st - century society of ours , that demands respect			2
respect for their courage but also respect for their humility .			0

hundreds of tales of bravery from the @entity88 which have gone untold - because the generation that fought were not the sort to boast
@entity7 fought in @entity23 and returned as an unassuming bus *driver*
@entity111 was a daring @entity110 officer , but became a quiet greengrocer
@entity402 led thousands of pows to safety , but received no acclaim
but the fear of death - and desire for a normal life when they returned - kept them quiet about their amazing feats - which are still being *unveiled* today
