fish - oil supplements credited with a range of health benefits could trigger prostate cancer			1
experts found that omega - 3 fatty acids may raise the risk of the most lethal form of the disease by more than 70 per cent			2
researchers warned against omega - 3 pills , and recommended eating just one or two meals of oily fish per week			1
fish - oil supplements are said to protect against heart attacks and strokes , stave off arthritis , boost brain power and prevent behaviour disorders in children			2
taking omega - 3 fatty acids , derived from fish oils , can increase a man 's risk of high - grade prostate cancer by 71 per cent however , scientists found that those with the highest levels of omega - 3 in their blood were 71 per cent more likely to develop fast - growing , hard - to - treat prostate tumours			1
they were also more likely to contract the slower , less deadly form of the disease , with the overall prostate cancer risk raised by 43 per cent			1
the team from the @entity34 in @entity35 warned : ‘ there is really no evidence that taking dietary supplements is beneficial to health , and there is increasing evidence that taking high doses is harmful			0
’ dr @entity43 said the levels of @entity27 linked to the increased cancer risk would be reached by taking just one supplement a day , or three or four meals of fish such as salmon and mackerel each week			1
of mealtimes , he said : ‘ there are good things in fish , so the message is moderation			0
it is probably not bad for you , and it tastes good			0
’ taking omega - 3 was also associated with a 44 per cent greater chance of developing low - grade prostate cancer however , he stressed that when compared to fatty acids received by eating oily fish , the amount consumed via pills was ‘ huge ’			1
it is unclear how fish oil could trigger tumours , but @entity27 may restrict the immune system , or damage our dna			1
it is also unclear if it helps tumours to grow and spread			0
the finding came amid a wider research project of more than 2,000 men , examining whether supplements of vitamin e and the mineral selenium can help prevent prostate cancer – the most common cancer in @entity85 men , killing more than 10,000			1
@entity86 provided no benefit , and vitamin e increased the odds of contracting the disease			0
dr @entity90 said : ‘ as we do more and more of these studies – and i have been involved in them most of my career – we find high doses of supplements have no effect or increase the risk of the disease you are trying to prevent			2
‘ there is not really a single example of where taking a supplement lowers chronic disease risk			0
’ professor @entity106 , of @entity107 , said : ‘ the results of this study are surprising , and we clearly need more research to understand what is behind them			0
’ although he stressed the researchers could not be certain whether the study ’s participants ate oily fish or took omega - 3 supplements , he said the results ‘ show how complex the effects of food supplements might be ’			2
dr @entity122 @entity85 agreed that ‘ larger and more complex studies will need to take place before we understand how the risks of a diet high in omega - 3 balance against [ its ] benefits ’			2
several recent studies have called @entity27 ’s benefits to the heart into question , too			0
one , which examined 20 studies involving almost 70,000 people , found that those who took omega - 3 were no less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than others			0

supplement was also increased low - grade prostate cancer risk by 44 *%*
one theory is that pills may dampen down the immune system
@entity27 fish oils are one of the most *popular* supplements in the @entity85
