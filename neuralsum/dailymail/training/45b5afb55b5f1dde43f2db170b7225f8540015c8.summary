by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 10:51 est , 11 march 2014 engineers have launched an underwater contraption which enables watergoers to ' swim like a dolphin ' - similar to the jet used in the 1965 @entity8 film @entity9			1
the cutting - edge watercraft , called @entity11 , uses a revolutionary electric jet that generates 700 newtons of thrust , propelling users along under the waves at speeds of up to 9mph ( 15km/h )			1
the jet system is the first in the world to feature an impeller - a special kind of rotor - powered by an electric motor , which sucks in water then fires it out the back of the craft			2
the craft is steered using the driver 's bodyweight to angle the craft performance : @entity37 maximum thrust : 734 n speed over water : up to 13mph ( 22 km / h ) speed under water : up to 9mph ( 15 km / h ) average operating time : 60 minutes diving depth : up to 131ft ( 40m ) dimensions : 51 " x 18.9 " x 15 " weight : 64kg @entity46 in water : 8kg colours : @entity49 , orange , yellow , blue , silver , white , titanium and chrome it can dive to more than 130ft - the maximum depth for recreational divers - and can operate for an hour			1
the craft 's speed is controlled by hand controls that flick through its 10 gears			1
it is steered using the driver 's bodyweight to angle the craft , while an onboard computer informs users of power usage , depth , water temperature and speed			1
the basic model starts at £ 12,500 ( $ 20,700 ) but buyers can spend almost double for a top of the range one that comes with a special charger and case			1
the futuristic machine is the brainchild of @entity83 based in @entity84 , @entity85			0
its website describes the @entity11 as the ' absolute epitome of strength , technological intelligence and perfect function '			2
' relaxed gliding , sporty driving or diving safely under water - it 's all possible with a @entity11			2
' it 's now actually possible to move through the water like a dolphin , either on the surface or at depth			0
' the electric jetstream system in the @entity11 , pictured , has been patented and uses an electro - motor with a protected running impeller in a jet channel			2
it works on the principle of water displacement			0
water is sucked in by the powerful rotating impeller and forced out in the jet channel under high pressure above water , the @entity11 can reach speeds of up to 13mph ( 22 km / h ) , and up to 9mph ( 15 km / h ) under water			2
it weighs 64kg and has a 8kg buoyancy in the water			0
it is available in red , orange , yellow , pictured , blue , silver , white , titanium and chrome the @entity11 is similar to the underwater jet seen in the 1965 @entity8 film , @entity9 , pictured , starring @entity126 ' the @entity11 offers all - round high - performance			1
this is because its hydrodynamic shape gives it unexpected agility in the water			0
' steering and diving could n't be easier - it 's all done by shifting your body weight			0
apply only light pressure and the @entity11 will obligingly begin to dive , man and machine forging ahead with power and purpose			1
the electric jetstream system has been patented and uses an electro - motor with a protected running impeller in a jet channel			0
the basic model of the @entity11 from @entity146 , pictured , starts at £ 12,500 ( $ 20,700 ) but buyers can spend almost double for a top of the range one that comes with a special charger and case @entity85 makers @entity146 also sell a @entity154 version of its jet , pictured , which is 35kg , reaches speeds of up to 12mph ( 20km/h ) above water and has a force of 680 newtons			1
this smaller model costs £ 6,500 ( $ 10,805 ) it works on the principle of water displacement where water is sucked in by the powerful rotating impeller and forced out in the jet channel under high pressure			1
' this special patent means that its electric jetstream system is unique when it comes to drive systems for high - performance water vehicles , ' continued @entity83			0
above water , the @entity11 can reach speeds of up to 13mph ( 22 km / h ) , and up to 9mph ( 15 km / h ) under water			0
it weighs 141lb ( 64kg ) and has a 17lb ( 8kg ) buoyancy in the water			0
it is available in red , orange , yellow , blue , silver , white , titanium and chrome			0
@entity184 said : ' steering and diving could n't be easier - it 's all done by shifting your body weight			0
apply only light pressure and the @entity11 will obligingly begin to dive , man and machine forging ahead with power and purpose ' @entity8 films have a history of underwater vehicles , including the @entity198 , pictured , featured in 1977 @entity8 film @entity197			1

the @entity11 can dive to more than 130ft and operate for an hour
its speed is controlled by hand controls that flick through the craft 's gears
the @entity11 is steered using the driver 's bodyweight to angle the craft
@entity212 informs users of power usage , depth , temperature and speed
basic model costs £ 12,500 ( $ 20,700 ) and generates 700 newtons of thrust
it is similar to the underwater jet used in the @entity8 film @entity9
