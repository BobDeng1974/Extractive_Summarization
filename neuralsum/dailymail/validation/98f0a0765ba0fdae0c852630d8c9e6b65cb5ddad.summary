with confirmation on the packet that the product contains ' 100 per cent @entity5 potatoes ' , you can hardly accuse the manufacturer of misleading customers			0

at first i thought it was a ball of soggy crisps			0
when i realised what it was , everyone in the office laughed			0
‘ we could n’t believe it			0
it is likely i will buy them again - brand does n’t bother me with crisps			0
