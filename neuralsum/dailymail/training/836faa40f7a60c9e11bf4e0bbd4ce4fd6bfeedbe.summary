by @entity0 published : 20:49 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 04:00 est , 11 december 2012 rip - off train companies are being ‘ totally dishonest ’ with passengers on punctuality and must start telling them ‘ within just a minute ’ when their trains are on time , says transport minister @entity7			1
in a damning broadside against major train operators he said passengers – and taxpayers - have a right to consider trains to be late if they fail to meet a much stricter 60 second deadline			1
set against that tougher ‘ just a minute ’ punctuality measure up to a third of trains currently deemed ‘ on time ’ would be late			1
watchdogs said passengers felt ‘ ripped off			1
’ the transport minister wants trains to be judged late if one minute has passed since it was due , not 10 minutes as it currently is mr @entity7 wants train companies to tighten up their time - keeping			1
he is demanding an end to the farce which now allows rail companies up to ten minutes leeway on lateness and still have their trains considered officially punctual			2
currently train companies can massage their figures by being allowed to claim officially that their trains are ‘ on time ’ if they arrive within five minutes for short - distance and within 10 minutes for long - distance services			1
this is called the ‘ public performance measure ’ or ‘ ppm			0
’ allowing just a minute ’s leeway is called ' right - time performance			1
’ but too many train companies are ‘ dragging their heels ’ in being open with passengers who buy their tickets and taxpayers who subsidise the railways , he said			2
the broadside and warning of an impending crackdown was launched by mr @entity7 after he addressed a ‘ @entity53 ’ organised by the watchdog @entity54 ( @entity54 ) on monday			1
if the new scheme was put in place , up to a third of trains currently deemed ' on time ' would be late mr @entity7 , who is fed up with the train companies ’ sleight of hand told the @entity62 afterwards : ‘ it is totally dishonest to say trains are punctual when for short distance and journeys they can arrive within 4 minutes and 59 seconds and for long - distance they can be within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still count as being officially on time			1
taxpayers and passengers deserve better than this			2
‘ that is why we are putting pressure on the rail industry to publish proper real - time performance figures			2
' taking his cue from two popular @entity78 comedy series , mr @entity7 said : ‘ punctuality should be measured by ‘ @entity80 ’ , not ‘ i ’m sorry i have n’t a clue			1
’ latest figures show that under the current system around 9 out of 10 ( 89.3 per cent ) of trains are now officially on time			2
but under the stricter ‘ right time ’ counting , this plummets to around 6 out 10 ( 62 per cent ) – a fall of around a third			0
under the current system for long - distance operators who have ten minutes ’ leeway , @entity88 currently measures just over three - quarters ( 77.5 per cent ) on time , @entity94 ( 88.2 per cent ) , and @entity95 ( 87.4 per cent )			0
but under the stricter measure of trains being late if they are just a minute overdue , the punctuality rate for long - distance trains plummets to just half ( 50 per cent ) on time			1
similarly , punctuality performance for @entity103 and regional services is artificially enhanced by the current measure – with @entity106 ( 93 per cent ) , @entity107 ( 97.8per cent ) , @entity108 ( 87.2 per cent ) , @entity109 ( 88.7 per cent ) , @entity110 ( 89.3 per cent ) , @entity111 ( 88 per cent ) , @entity112 ( 91.8 per cent ) , @entity113 ( 88 per cent ) , @entity114 ( 81.1per cent ) , and @entity115 ( 93 per cent )			0
but measured under the ‘ just a minute ’ leeway rules , punctuality for regional services in @entity103 and the @entity118 plummets to just 62.7 per cent , and in the rest of the @entity120 ( including @entity109 ) to 63.4 per cent on time			1
currently only broad regional ‘ real time ’ breakdowns are published			0
but next week @entity124 will go further and publish ‘ real time ’ punctuality figures by individual train company			0
these will show wide variation in performance – with some companies currently considered to be officially ‘ punctual ’ ending up ‘ late ’ when given only 59 seconds leeway			0
the transport minister called train companies ' totally dishonest ' when they say a train is within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still counts as being officially on time and early next year mr @entity7 says he intends to publish real time figures for individual train service routes , so rail traveller can see how the train they catch performs in ‘ real time			1
’ he said : ‘ people want to know punctual the train they use is			0
taxpayers also have a tight to know			0
‘ it is much better if train companies are as open as possible rather than forcing people to make freedom of information requests			0
the irony is that train punctuality is pretty good and much better than it has been			0
’ @entity54 chairman @entity152 told the @entity53 : ‘ we believe that greater transparency in the rail industry can deliver great benefits for passengers , taxpayers , business , and the rail industry itself			0
‘ lack of trust breeds suspicion that passengers are being ‘ ripped off ’ and taxpayers are not getting value from the railways			2
customers expect to see more and better information on mobile devices			0
’ but a spokesman for the @entity170 ( @entity170 ) said : ‘ rail passengers already know far more about how the services they use perform compared to other forms of transport such as road or air travel			2
‘ we have responded to the government ’s wish for further information on performance , despite repeatedly making it clear that the data is not yet reliable			0

transport minister @entity7 *insists* only trains arriving within a minute of their *schedule* can be *classed* as on time
new rules mean up to a third of trains would be *reclassified* as late
watchdogs say passengers feel ' ripped off '
