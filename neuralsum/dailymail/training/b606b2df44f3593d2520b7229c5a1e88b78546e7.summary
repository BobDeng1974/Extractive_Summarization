thousands of immigrants seeking legalization through the @entity3 court system have had their hearings canceled and are being told by the government that it may be 2019 or later before their futures are resolved			2
some immigration lawyers fear the delay will leave their clients at risk of deportation as evidence becomes dated , witnesses disappear , sponsoring relatives die and dependent children become adults			1
the increase in cancellations began late last summer after the @entity19 prioritized the tens of thousands of @entity21 migrants crossing the @entity3 - @entity23 border , most of them mothers with children and unaccompanied minors			1
@entity28 , left , his wife @entity29 , and their 6 - year - old daughter , @entity30 , would benefit from @entity32 recently winning his appeal to become a legal permanent resident			0
but his case still needs to go in front of an immigration judge one last time , and it has been pulled from the docket immigration lawyers in cities that absorbed a large share of those cases , including @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , say they 've had hearings canceled with little notice and received no new court dates			1
work permits , green cards , asylum claims , and family reunifications hang in the balance			1
@entity47 immigration lawyer @entity56 said he 's never seen such a standstill in nearly 30 years of practice			2
' there is no maneuverability , ' he said			0
' it 's as if we have no court at all			0
' one of @entity56 ' clients , @entity65 , 34 , recently won his appeal to become a legal permanent resident			2
but his case still needs to go in front of an immigration judge one last time , and it has been pulled from the docket			2
@entity30 , who is from the @entity23 state of @entity72 , entered the @entity3 illegally in 1998			0
he has been fighting deportation since 2011 , when he came to authorities ' attention after his second driving under the influence charge			2
he lives in suburban @entity47 with his @entity3 wife , @entity29 , and their 6 - year - old daughter , and they are expecting their second child in august			0
meanwhile @entity30 's brother in @entity23 is dying of kidney failure , and @entity30 ca n't leave the country			2
' it 's sad , ' @entity30 said in a telephone interview			0
' i feel bad not seeing him , to say one last goodbye			0
' before july , only immigrants in detention were considered a priority for the courts			1
under the new policies , unaccompanied minors and families facing deportation also have priority status , regardless of whether they 're in detention			1
the @entity100 , the @entity19 body that oversees the nation 's immigration courts , could not say precisely how many hearings had been canceled			2
but it said more than 415,000 immigrants who are not in detention have cases pending			1
hearings are being rescheduled for nov. 29 , 2019 , as a way to keep cases on the docket , said @entity113 , legislative and public affairs counsel for @entity100			2
most , however , are likely to receive other dates - either earlier or later , as docket times become available , she said			0
@entity56 said thousands of non-priority cases in @entity47 alone have had hearings canceled			2
thousands of immigrants seeking legalization through the @entity3 court system have had their hearings canceled and are being told by the government that it may be 2019 or later before their futures are resolved when the surge hit last summer , immigration courts there were already short two judges because of retirements			1
two of the three remaining @entity47 immigration judges are hearing , via videoconference , cases of families detained in a new detention center in @entity135			1
the third @entity47 judge is hearing cases involving unaccompanied minors who 've been placed with relatives			1
@entity140 , a law professor at the @entity141 who worked for two @entity143 presidents , criticized @entity144 and the @entity146 administration for not funding more immigration judges			0
' you fund more investigators , more detention space , more border patrol , almost all of these are going to produce some kind of immigration court case , ' he said			1
' you are putting a lot more people into the system			0
it 's just going to be a big bottleneck unless you increase the size of that pipeline			0
' @entity45 's immigration courts , which like @entity47 's are handling a large number of unaccompanied children and detained families , also have seen the cancellations of all non-detainee hearings , which are not considered priority			1
@entity170 , a @entity45 lawyer , said hearings have been postponed for hundreds of cases his firm is handling			0
longtime green card holders facing deportation over minor crimes or procedural issues are going to suffer needlessly , along with their families , he said			1
' this is their home , and they do n't know if they are going to be forcibly removed from it , ' he said			0
' and they are not going to get any resolution on that until 2019			0
' @entity187 does not jeopardize all immigrants facing deportation as many are still able to work under existing permits until their cases can be heard			1
@entity187 does not jeopardize all immigrants facing deportation as many are still able to work under existing permits until their cases can be heard the delays might even provide some immigrants with weaker petitions more time to build a stronger case			1
' moving the docket back four years to some people will be devastating , ' said @entity201 , an immigration lawyer in @entity202			0
' to other people it 's , wow , four years in the @entity3			0
' asylum seekers , who often have had to leave behind families in countries ravaged by war and violence , are among the hardest hit , said @entity212 - @entity211 , an immigration lawyer in @entity44			1
his firm has had eight case hearing cancellations so far , including that of a severely disabled young man from @entity218 with an asylum petition			0
another dozen asylum claims at his firm have not been scheduled			0

' starting may or june , there is likely going to be another surge of unaccompanied kids or families , ' said @entity232 , a lawyer for the @entity45 - based @entity233			1
' presumably this issue is going to continue			0
