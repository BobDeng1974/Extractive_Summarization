since @entity2 ’s mission to @entity3 got under way on august 6 , the @entity0 has beamed some astonishing images back to @entity6 that have left scientists and amateur star - gazers alike scratching their heads and envisioning ufos			1
but even seasoned alien watchers were puzzled when the rover making its way through the @entity3 send back the image of what appeared to be a fossilized human finger			1
@entity19 user @entity17 , part of a group called @entity22 , who had caused a stir on the @entity25 last week after pointing out white ‘ flying objects ’ zooming across the @entity3 sky called attention to a collection of ‘ mysterious ’ items he spotted in a video from @entity33			1
ancient digit : a @entity19 user claimed that the rover stumbled upon an ancient , fossilized human finger , which in reality is likely just a rock @entity3 footwear : another rock that caught the attention of the @entity43 enthusiast made him think of a long - forgotten shoe or sandal on the surface of the @entity3 ‘ @entity50 ( sp ) captures a possible ancient finger , a dome shaped object , a shoe or sandal and a possible @entity3 creature , ’ @entity48 wrote in the video description			1
‘ are these anomalies real , tricks of the light or something else , as always you decide			0
’ the image shows what appears to be a rock shaped like a digit with a faint outline at one end that vaguely resembles a fingernail			0
another rock found nearby resembles an overturned sandal , and a crevice on another geological formation looks like a smiling @entity3 critter , @entity68 reported			1
@entity2 , however , has so far made no ground - breaking announcements regarding the discovery of life forms – or @entity3 footwear , for that matter - on the @entity3 , leaving @entity43 enthusiasts guessing and wondering			1
on august 18 , @entity48 posted footage in which he applied a series of filters to a @entity83 , revealing what he claimed to be four objects resembling flying saucers hovering in the sky			0
martian life form : an image of a rock with a crevice in the middle vaguely resembles a grinning extra-terrestrial critter ‘ four objects caught by @entity83 , very difficult to make out on original image so i have used a few filters to highlight , ’ he said in the video description			0
‘ what are these four objects ? ufos , dust particles , or something else ? as always you decide			0
’ experts , however , came out saying that the four ‘ objects ’ are actually just dead pixels in the rover 's ccd camera — single points in the camera 's imager that have lost functionality and register as white			2
@entity114 , a photo and video analyst for @entity117 [ @entity117 ] , told @entity118 , ‘ i fully concur at this point that these are dead pixels on the imager			0
all ccd ( cameras ) have them , and in a bland atmosphere like that at @entity3 , they would be very obvious as opposed to an active atmosphere like @entity6 , where they could end up hidden for a long time before anyone noticed them			2
’ @entity43 or camera snafu : the same relentless web user posted footage in which he applied a series of filters to a @entity83 image , revealing what he claimed to be four objects resembling flying saucers theory debunked : experts came out saying that the four ' saucers ' are actually just dead pixels in the rover 's camera the @entity19 video - posted by a @entity48 - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence			1
a fourth blob can be seen to the top of this image just two days after the rover touched down on @entity3 , back to @entity6 caused many @entity43 hunters to perk up			1
it seemed that @entity2 has itself captured something very strange on camera , including a strange white light dancing across the horizon of the red planet , and four blobs hovering in the sky while the images are certainly a curiosity , @entity2 and photography experts insist that these are nothing more than blemishes on the images , picked up by the camera lens sitting on the rover at a distance of 350 million miles away			1
so what are the @entity3 anomalies ? view the videos below : 1 ) some internet users claim to be able to see a speck of light rapidly traversing the @entity3 horizon on the images below 2 ) it may not look like much , but on the dry and barren @entity3 landscape , any movement is unexpected - and some claim to be able to see a light which apparently lifts itself off the ground below 3 ) on some returned images from the @entity83 , strange pinpoints appear in the sky - are they spaceships , or just abnormalities on the camera ? so far , @entity2 has not commented on any of the strange sightings , but alien hunters have suggested these are alien ships monitoring our baby steps into the universe			1
@entity83 , a six - wheeled vehicle the size of a compact car , landed inside a vast , ancient impact crater near @entity3 ' equator on august 6 after an eight - month , 354 - million - mile voyage through space			2
earlier this week , the rover was seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of @entity3			2
engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one - ton vehicle 's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days			0
the @entity3 motor was also shown flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time			2
the 7 - foot - long ( 2.1 - meter - long ) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a camera , a drill , a spectrometer , a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered rock and soil			0
the @entity83 zapped its first rock on sunday with a high - powered laser gun designed to analyze @entity3 mineral content , and scientists declared their target practice a success			0
the robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist - sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10 - second period , @entity2 said in a statement issued from mission control at the @entity244 near @entity245			0
the strange shimmering lights seen by @entity83 : the original image from the @entity2 website : the ' ufos ' are faint in this image , but observable through adjusting the contrast and brightness a close - up of the blobs : are these glitches in the images - or something a bit more exciting ? decide for yourself : ufos or dead pixels ?			0

@entity43 hunters claim to have spotted lights in the @entity3 sky
one web user believes he spotted ancient human finger and overturned shoe on @entity3 ' surface
experts insist they are nothing more than blemishes on the camera
