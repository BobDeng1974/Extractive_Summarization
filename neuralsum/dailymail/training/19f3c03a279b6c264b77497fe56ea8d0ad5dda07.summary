by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:28 pm on 17th august 2011 @entity3 troops could unwittingly be putting themselves in grave danger in the @entity5 , an official report suggests , after five million pieces of body armour were found not to have properly been tested			1
the @entity11 can not be certain that the critical battlefield equipment ever met the standards to protect @entity3 troops before it was sent out , the @entity10 's inspector general found			2
the @entity16 report focused on seven @entity11 contracts for the plates , known as ballistic inserts , awarded between 2004 and 2006 and totalling $ 2.5billion			1
unprotected ? 80 per cent of @entity20 serving in @entity21 who had been shot in the upper body died because of inadequate body armour the inspector general 's audit , carried out over a two - year period ending in march , found the tests were incomplete , conducted with the wrong size plates or relied on ballistic test rounds that were inconsistent			1
due to the demands of the wars in @entity21 and @entity36 , tests under certain temperatures and altitudes were scrapped altogether			1
' consequently , the @entity11 can not be sure that ballistic inserts meet ... requirements , ' the report said			2
' as a result , the @entity11 lacks assurance that 5.1 million ballistic inserts acquired through the seven contracts provide appropriate protection			0
' the inspector general said it did not conduct its own tests so it could n't say whether the plates were defective			2
campaigner : the report was the fourth in a series by the inspector general in response to probing by representative @entity55 in response , the @entity11 said on tuesday that it had initiated improvements to the testing system before and during the inspector general 's audit			0
the service also said ' all inspector general recommendations to improve the testing processes have been implemented			0
... the @entity11 continues to work with the test community for test improvements to provide the best body armour possible to the soldier			1
' this month 's report was the fourth in a series by the inspector general in response to representative @entity55			0
since january 2006 , the @entity72 @entity71 has pressed the military about the effectiveness of body armour after the @entity76 reported that 80 per cent of @entity20 serving in @entity21 who had been shot in the upper body had died because of inadequate body armour			1
the body armour used by most @entity3 troops comprises a ballistic vest with two large , hard ceramic plates that protect the upper body from bullets and shrapnel			1
the equipment has been crucial for @entity3 forces in @entity21 and @entity36 for nearly a decade			1
the 51 - page @entity89 report said the @entity11 program manager for soldier equipment could provide only ' limited assurance ' that the plates met requirements			2
the inspector general found that for all seven contracts the program manager did not have a consistent way of measuring and recording velocity of the test rounds			0
two designs were approved without valid tests			0
the @entity11 said it had created a database for test information , standardised the protocol for ballistic testing and continues to scan body armour plates before deployment and during a soldier 's tour of duty to ensure there are no internal cracks			1
exposed : the @entity11 said on tuesday that it had initiated improvements to the testing system before and during the inspector general 's audit ' the @entity11 conducts rigorous and extensive testing of body armor to ensure that it meets @entity11 standards and is safe for use in combat , ' the service said in comments included in the report			2
in an interview , rep. @entity55 said she planned to write to defence secretary @entity125 and @entity11 secretary @entity126 calling their attention to the inspector general 's report			0
both @entity125 and @entity126 are former @entity132 colleagues of @entity55 , a 13 - term congresswoman			0
' this needs to be told , ' she said , remembering the dead and wounded from the nation 's wars			0
' at the least , we should have some confidence that this part is taken care of , that in the future more diligence is taken			0
