@entity0 may not be able to claim that @entity1 is a product of their youth set - up , but the @entity6 youngster is quickly becoming the next big thing at @entity8			1
@entity1 , who has only just turned 20 , put in another impeccable performance during @entity0 's 2 - 0 victory against @entity11 on saturday			1
for much of the season , the defensive partnership of @entity13 and @entity14 has provided a firm base for a @entity0 side looking to win their first @entity19 title since 2010 , but that was until the shock 5 - 3 defeat against rivals @entity23 on @entity24			2
@entity1 has put in a number of impressive performances for @entity0 this season the @entity6 youngster tackles @entity27 during @entity0 's 2 - 0 win against @entity11 @entity1 marshalled the right side of @entity0 's defence at @entity8 on saturday @entity13 , in particular , had a game to forget at @entity32 and was lucky not to have been shown a red card for a kick on @entity35 in the second half			1
the @entity38 vice-captain often has to bear the brunt of the criticism from @entity0 fans should the @entity42 succumb to a defeat and many would have been pleased to see @entity1 alongside stalwart @entity14 at @entity8 on saturday			1
strong , quick and confident in possession , @entity1 has all the tools to become a star in west @entity47			0
he 's not bad in the opposition 's box either , scoring more goals ( two ) in his first season for @entity0 than much - maligned striker @entity52 did during his first term in a blue shirt			0
@entity1 played alongside @entity0 captain @entity14 ( left ) at the heart of the @entity42 ' defence @entity1 scores @entity0 's third goal during the @entity59 third round win against @entity60 one thing that can not be questioned is his bravery on the field			1
@entity1 showed his commitment to the cause during @entity0 's 3 - 1 @entity67 quarter - final win against @entity68 after being clattered by @entity69 as the pair attempted to clear a corner			2
the defender was knocked to the floor from a @entity68 corner and received treatment for seven minutes as the first half drew to a close			0
@entity1 has now played in @entity0 's last two games and the @entity42 having conceded a goal , while scoring five at the other end			2
he made 87 per cent of his passes on saturday , won three duels and three recoveries			0
@entity1 is clattered by goalkeeper @entity69 as the @entity42 no 1 punches the ball clear against @entity68 @entity13 ( left ) had a game to forget as @entity0 were beaten 5 - 3 by @entity23 on @entity24 those at @entity8 on saturday will also have noticed @entity14 giving regular instructions to the 20 - year - old as the @entity42 captain looks to mould @entity1 into a force to be reckoned with			1
he 's already becoming somewhat of a cult hero in @entity93 , with fans around the ground chanting his surnames repeatedly			0
in fact , it was @entity1 who looked the more assured defender during a poor first 45 minutes from @entity14 which saw the former @entity38 captain easily beaten by @entity103 and @entity104 as @entity0 struggled to click into gear before an @entity107 striker settled the nerves			2
as @entity0 grew in confidence , so did @entity1 , bursting out of defence with the ball on more than one occasion as he looked to drive his team forward			0
@entity1 's chances have been limited this season , the the @entity6 has impressed when selected @entity116 signed @entity1 from @entity117 for a fee of £ 12.5million last year @entity14 may be playing some of the best football of his career this season , but at 34 , @entity116 must at least start to think about his eventual replacement			1
the @entity123 manager may have to look no further than his £ 12.5million signing should @entity1 continue to put in such impressive performances when called upon			0
on the flipside , @entity1 could actually help prolong @entity14 's career at the heart of the @entity0 defence			2
despite @entity14 's age , the pair still have time to form a perfect partnership in which @entity1 's pace and exuberance can dovetial with his skipper 's experiences and reading of the game			0
@entity0 fans have also understandably been quick to mention @entity142 's name when watching @entity1 grace the @entity8 turf			2
@entity0 fans have been comparing the young defender to former club captain @entity142 ( right ) @entity14 ( right ) learned his trade alongside @entity142 and will hope to guide @entity1 the former @entity42 captain was a commanding presence both on and off the field , and has rightly gone down as one of the @entity8 greats			1
it would perhaps be unfair to make such early comparisons , but @entity1 looks to possess the same leggy gate and similar characteristics to @entity142 and is quick to try and make a tackle unlike @entity13 who is often guilty of gifting opposing forwards too much space			0
assistant coach @entity158 labelled @entity1 's performance as ' immaculate ' while @entity42 boss @entity116 heaped praise on the former @entity117 man following his impressive display against @entity60			0
the 20 - year - old celebrates scoring on his @entity0 debut against @entity165 in september , 2014 @entity116 said recently : ' he [ @entity1 ] had another good game ' he made mistakes in pre-season			1
but apart from that , his outstanding physical condition and the way he sees the game and makes decision are very good			0
' @entity14 admits that learning from the likes of @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity142 greatly improved his game and there 's no doubt the 34 - year - old will be hoping to provide the same inspiration for @entity0 's @entity6 starlet .			1

@entity1 helped @entity0 to 2 - 0 win against @entity11 on saturday
@entity6 youngster has impressed despite limited first team chances
20 - year - old has been compared to former @entity42 captain @entity142
@entity13 *dropped* to the bench for @entity11 clash
@entity0 fans will hope @entity1 can one day replace @entity14
