@entity1 here to see how @entity3 reporters see @entity4 lining up this season former @entity4 midfielder @entity5 believes manager @entity7 's greatest challenge is accommodating the attacking options he now has at his disposal			1
however , he admits the @entity10 also has to sort out the @entity12 ' suspect defence if they are to secure a return to the @entity14 this season			1
the Â£ 59.7million arrival of @entity18 winger @entity17 and on - loan @entity20 striker @entity19 means @entity21 now has to fit them into a team which also has @entity26 and @entity27 captains @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity31 international @entity30 and precocious teenager @entity32			1
challenge : @entity7 must accomodate ( @entity34 ) @entity17 , @entity29 and @entity28 selection dilema : @entity21 's biggest problem will be fitting all his forwards into a team at @entity39 @entity19 could make his debut at home to @entity42 on sunday but it remains to be seen how the @entity4 boss will set up his side			1
asked if the biggest problem is fitting everyone into a starting @entity47 , @entity5 told mutv : ' it is yeah , but it 's not a bad problem to have			2
' fans have been moaning about the type of players that were at the club and now you ca n't do that			0
' i think @entity59 ( executive vice-chairman ) has done his job brilliantly during this transfer window with some great signings			0
bringing up the rear : former @entity4 midfielder @entity5 also thinks that @entity4 's defence must improve ' the calibre of player we have brought in is top quality , like @entity70 and @entity19			1
' these are proper players			0
we just have to find a way of getting them all in the same team , playing well and scoring goals - which we have struggled to do a little bit			0
' now it is over to the manager to sort everything out and make us a good team again			1
' defensively we have n't been great either so he needs to sort that out			0
then , i 'm sure we can be vying for @entity14 places			0
' @entity70 has proven his versatility in a number of positions for club and country but @entity5 feels he has to become the go - to winger for his new side			1
sacrificed ? @entity30 ( r ) is widely expected to make way for @entity4 's new attacking signings ' i would like to see @entity70 play wide , ' @entity5 added			1
' @entity94 is going to play with wide players i 'm not too sure , but we saw the other night that he was devastating for @entity18 against @entity97 in wide areas			1
' whether it is the right or left - hand side , his pace is frightening			0
' he can go past players and score goals			0
that is something we have been missing			0
' i am sure he can play in the central areas as well , but if i was picking him then it would be in the wide areas			2
' ready : @entity19 ( r ) appeared in @entity20 's friendly against @entity109 ahead of his expected debut against @entity42 @entity5 is optimistic @entity4 will see the best of @entity19 again after his recovery from anterior knee ligament surgery			1
' @entity19 's goalscoring record is brilliant from when he has been at @entity115 and @entity116 , ' said the midfielder			2
' the goals he has scored have been important , then there is the movement he brings and his experience as well at 28 years of age			0
' you just hope his knee is right , i think that will be the main problem but once he gets going and @entity70 can start creating chances for him then i 'm sure we will start scoring goals			2

@entity7 faces challenge to fit forwards into team , says @entity5
@entity4 manager must accommodate @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity17 , @entity32 and @entity19
former @entity27 boss must also sort out @entity12 ' suspect defence
@entity70 should play in the wide role he performs for @entity18
@entity19 should have recovered from his anterior *cruciate* knee *injury*
