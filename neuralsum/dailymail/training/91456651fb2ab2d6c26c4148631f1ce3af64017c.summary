a disgruntled commuter has hit back at delays on @entity3 trains by disfiguring a picture of the group ceo 's face every time his service is late			1
@entity8 has decided to vent his frustration at the company 's late - running services by altering an image of ceo @entity13 - who is the boss of parent company @entity15			1
he then posts his surreal and bizarre creations to a @entity18 blog called @entity19			1
@entity8 has hit out at delays on @entity3 trains by altering a picture of the group ceo @entity13 every time his service is late			1
@entity22 is mr @entity13 , who is head of parent group first , as he looks usually and his face superimposed onto that of @entity27 actress @entity26 as character @entity28 mr @entity8 then posts the images on to his @entity18 blog - which is called @entity19			1
in one ( left ) the ceo 's head has evidently been squashed and right , he appears with no hair in one of the images ( left ) the ceo 's facial features have been removed - with rather disconcerting results - while in another mr @entity13 's face is plastered all over his suit mr @entity8 also photoshopped mr @entity13 on to the front page of @entity40 ! magazine ( left ) and took a picture of his face merged with the bottom half of the @entity45 's head as it appears on a bank note in most of the posts , mr @entity8 also includes which service - and how long it was delayed - under the image			1
the blog already contains hundreds of altered images and @entity52 - including one of the ceo transformed in to @entity28 , another of him on the front cover of @entity40 and even one of mr @entity13 looking very like singer @entity58			1
on the blog , mr @entity8 - who works in marketing - explains why he decided to take the unique approach to making a complaint about the company			1
in a post which is addressed to the ceo , mr @entity8 writes : ' every time my train is delayed i ’m going to edit your face			1
why ? because you are the ceo of ‘ @entity15 ’ and therefore ultimately responsible for the train line ‘ @entity3			2
’ i want you to understand that little delays matter			0
' it ’s an awful train line , @entity73 it really is			0
do n’t get me wrong , @entity13 there have been times i ’ve seriously questioned myself over this			2
i ’m aware that this is not normal behaviour			0
mr @entity13 also appears as @entity79 on the blog ( left ) and in another his head is replaced by a shrimp the ceo 's face is turned upside down ( left ) and in another he has green skin like the @entity85 and ' i love train ' written on his forehead in another ( left ) the ceo has bulging eyes and a mustache , while in another he sports a rather fat - looking lip mr @entity8 includes some @entity91 in his collection - such as this one of the ceo looking like @entity94 ' i have to hide my screen from other commuters while i ’m doing ‘ my work ’			1
once i spent two hours making you a little suit made out of repeating patterns of your face			0
you have to ask yourself some serious questions when you find yourself doing a thing like that			0
' the thing is , @entity13 , it helps me get through the stress of the journey			2
editing your face is very cathartic			0
' he continues : ' so , what ’s my beef with @entity3 ? to start with , the trains are pretty rubbish			2
there is never a seat on the way home after work and sometimes there is n’t one on the way in			0
have you ever stood up from @entity121 to @entity122 , @entity13 ? mr @entity13 transformed into a fist ( left ) and looking very like ' hot convict ' @entity125 ( right ) the ceo 's features on the face of terrifying clown it ( left ) while his eyes have been put on the face of a brown @entity131 in a suit ( right ) mr @entity13 's face replaced with an egg ( left ) and his eyes and mouth photoshopped on a bathing woman covered head to toe in soap suds in this @entity142 , mr @entity13 's face is transformed into a fruit machine ' i ’ve seen things you people would n’t believe			1
men in tears at @entity150			0
women fainting on the “ dark stretch ” between @entity153 and @entity154			0
i ’ve seen vomit in @entity156 and smelt some of the finest @entity158 in @entity159			0
' however , the thing i ’m going to focus all my baffling attention on is the fact that every train is delayed			0
you may well have ruddy - faced analysts telling you that : “ we ’re actually running a service with 79 % of trains running on time			0
” but take it from me			0
a man at the fried - chicken smelling coal - face			2
almost every single train to and from work is delayed			2
' in response , @entity13 said today : ' this is definitely one of the most creative complaints that i 've seen and @entity8 ’s work is an improvement on my photo ! mr @entity13 as controversial singer @entity181 ( left ) and as @entity183 's @entity182 's @entity58 ( right ) the ceo with a train coming out of his mouth ( left ) and as a demonic @entity187 ( right ) this rather surreal @entity142 shows the ceo 's head flying round in circles in space ' but there 's a serious point here : trains on this section of the route are frequently held up in the area around @entity197 and i 'm sorry that @entity8 and others get delayed because of this			1
' it 's mostly because we have to share tracks around the station with many other routes and operators , and there is plenty of improvement work going on in the area for the @entity210			2
' this will result in a brand new station and dedicated train tracks and platforms for @entity210 services and there will be a fleet of new , longer , trains as well from 2016 which we 've been developing with the government – our only regret is that we wo n’t be getting the opportunity to deliver these improvements ourselves as they will be introduced after our handover to @entity225 from september			0
' mr @entity13 with no eyes in front of @entity229 's @entity228 and with the head of @entity231 from @entity234 film @entity232 ( right ) mr @entity13 looking exceptionally glamorous as a blue @entity236 bunny - complete with ears and fluffy dress the ceo 's face around @entity241 's @entity240 in @entity242			1
