grief can play strange tricks on the mind , but a family that lost their son in the @entity8 tornado in may of this year are convinced they have seen their son since his death			1
a photo of a young niece of the @entity15 family seems to show their son , @entity16 , appearing in the background			2
their son was amongst seven third - graders who died at @entity22 when the storm hit , but they are finding comfort in this new picture			1
@entity15 believes it to be his son who was killed spotted : @entity39 , 9 , was killed when a tornado struck @entity22 in @entity8 , @entity41 in may of this year dad : @entity15 believe that is it definitely his son that is appearing behind his niece in the photograph ' i could n't believe what i was seeing			1
@entity49 loved the @entity50 and he loved firecrackers , ' @entity15 told @entity52 9			0
the picture that was taken on july 4th showed @entity49 ' cousin , @entity55 , playing with a sparkler			1
' my brother , when he saw it , he said the hair stood up on his neck , ' mr @entity15 added			0
' i was in awe			0
it touched my heart , ' ' it 's obviously not @entity55			1
it 's obvious there are two people there or one person there and one spirit there			0
' sparkly : @entity15 's niece , @entity55 , was thought to be the only subject in the picture as she played with her sparkler on july 4th , but it appears not to be the case living on : the @entity15 family began a charity called @entity80 , @entity79 in honor of their precious son @entity16			1
the want to see all @entity41 schools have shelters or safe rooms to protect children during a tornado remembered : seven third - graders died at @entity22 as the tornado roared through from the photo , it is easy to make out two distinct figures with different skin tones and different facial features			1
' i feel it , you know			0
i feel it that he 's here , ' says dad , @entity103			0
@entity49 was buried in his red @entity22 t - shirt			1
mr @entity15 said he can make out a red t - shirt on the figure behind @entity55			2
of course there are plenty of skeptics and non-believers			0
others have tried to come up with suggestions for the double image with some suggesting it is simply a blurry image of the young girl caused by the phone being shaken			2
to dad @entity15 , it makes no difference			0
he knows what he saw			0
' they can say what they want			0
i believe he 's watching over us , ' he said			0
@entity126 - @entity127 , @entity52 , @entity128 , @entity129 and sports seeing is believing : @entity15 wholeheartedly believes that his 9 - year - old son , @entity49 ( pictured ) , who died inside @entity22 during the disastrous tornado that struck @entity8 , @entity41 , has made himself visible from beyond the grave eye for detail : @entity49 was buried in his red @entity136 and his dad @entity103 says he can make out a red shirt on the figure seemingly standing behind cousin @entity55 flattened : the terrific tornado which tore through the @entity127 suburb of @entity8 reduced the @entity22 elementary school to rubble what once was : the photos of the remains of @entity22 shows how even the rooms that were spared by the tornado still show major damage planning questions : the students were told to hide in the hallway since they had no safe room on the afternoon of the tornado , there was unimaginable horror at @entity22 in @entity8 , @entity41 as the tornado ripped off the roof on its rampage of destruction , and leveled the building			1
the six other children who died were trapped underneath rubble when they were overcome by water from burst pipes			2
it was initially reported that the children died from drowning , but officials say the children were suffocated after being crushed by a falling wall			2
the elementary school had not built a tornado shelter as they could not afford it			1
despite enduring a devastating tornado that struck the area 14 years ago , most schools in @entity41 still have no purpose - built shelters			1
horrifying : the friendly images of zoo animal murals strike a sad contrast when seen next to the ceiling that is no longer attached to the school what stayed : some areas were only barely touched , like this door where all of the class photos remained safer : construction work on a safe room for the new school behind the crosses erected in memory of the seven students who died			0
once completed , the safe room will be able to accommodate all of the students at the new school live long in the memory : seven third graders died at @entity199 elementary			2
@entity200 was crushed under the weight of a wall that fell when the tornado hit			1

@entity200 was killed as a tornado hit his elementary school in @entity8 , @entity41
@entity208 killed seven school children at @entity22 on may 20th this year
photograph of cousin @entity55 *reveals* a strange image standing behind her taken six weeks later on july 4th
@entity216 convinced that it is his son , returning from the *afterlife*
