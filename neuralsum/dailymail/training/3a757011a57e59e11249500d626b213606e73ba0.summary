pope @entity0 said that guardian angels exist and people who listen to their advice are less likely to make the wrong decisions			1
' the doctrine on angels is not fantasist			2
no , it 's reality , ' the pope said on thursday during his daily mass in the small chapel in his residence at the @entity13			0
' according to @entity16 tradition we all have an angel with us , who protects us and helps us understand things , ' he said in a message to mark the feast of the guardian angels , celebrated by @entity23 on october 2			1
@entity0 asked ' how often have we heard ' i should do this , i should not do this , that 's not right , be careful ... '			2
so often ! it is the voice of our travelling companion			0
' the pope advised sceptics to ask themselves ' how is my relationship with my guardian angel ? do i listen to him ? do i say good morning to him ? do i ask him to watch over me when i sleep ? ' no one journeys alone and no one should think that they are alone , ' he said			1
his comments came ahead of a global assembly of @entity23 bishops that 's shaping up as the first major showdown of @entity0 's papacy , with conservative and progressive cardinals trading insults ahead of its start on sunday			1
the up - beat message that humans are helped along in life by an otherworldly guardian was in stark contrast to former pope @entity34 's insistence in 2012 that angels did not sing at the birth of @entity37 the two - week synod on the theme of the family will be attended by more than 250 people - nearly all of them bishops of the 1.2 billion - member @entity16 and also 13 married couples			1
the session will prepare the way for a larger gathering of @entity23 clerics next year and could become a milestone in the clash between conservatives and liberals over the future direction of a @entity16 that the pope has insisted must become less bureaucratic and theologically esoteric			2
the synod , the first since @entity0 ' election in march 2013 , is seen as a test case for him and his vision of a church he wants to be closer to the poor and suffering and not ' obsessed ' by issues such as homosexuality , abortion and contraception			0
the run - up to the meeting has been dominated by a rare public feud between cardinals centred on whether the @entity16 should modify teachings that ban @entity23 who have divorced and then remarried in civil services from receiving communion			0
for @entity23 , a second marriage without an often lengthy @entity16 annulment of the first amounts to adultery and anyone remarried in a civil ceremony can not receive communion at @entity117 unless they refrain from sexual relations with a new partner			0
that issue has emerged as the most likely candidate for possible reform after @entity0 ordered a worldwide survey of @entity23 and heard that many ignored @entity16 teachings on birth control , sex before marriage or acceptance of homosexuality			1
cardinal @entity130 , a @entity132 the pope has called one of his favourite theologians , has argued that the @entity16 must find ways of showing mercy to people whose first marriages have failed and who want to remain an integral part of the @entity16			0
but even the suggestion of change has galvanized conservatives , including a handful of senior @entity13 officials .			0
