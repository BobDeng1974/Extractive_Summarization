by @entity0 are you one of the many women in the @entity3 tempted to start an affair this week ? the first week of january is when it 's most likely to happen with lots of marriages stretched to the limit over the @entity10 break			1
used to be women had affairs if they fell out of love with their husbands and in love with someone else			1
the first week of january is when it 's most likely to happen with lots of marriages stretched to the limit over the @entity10 break these days , a woman can be blissfully happy with her 2.5 children , in love with her husband and reasonably sexually satisfied - and still feel justified having more than a bit on the side then it became pseudo-acceptable ( between friends and as much as affairs ever are accepted ) , to have if - only - i - had n't - drunk - so - much - or - i 'd - never - have - done - it one - night - slip - ups , if you were n't getting any at home			1
these days , a woman can be blissfully happy with her 2.5 children , in love with her husband and reasonably sexually satisfied - and still feel justified having more than a bit on the side			2
@entity37 - the @entity3 's largest and longest running dating site for married people - has 750,000 members			1
a high proportion are women			1
other sites like @entity44 and @entity45 are also boasting soaring female memberships			1
nine million @entity47 will look for love online this year - but around 1.4m women will instead search for sex on the side			1
women are better at keeping secrets and covering their tracks , so less likely to be discovered there 's been a massive shift in women 's attitudes towards affairs			1
some of it is the ' @entity62 ' effect : women feel they 've been given permission to push boundaries and try things they would n't dare to before			1
if their husbands do n't want to , they 'll go elsewhere			0
the guilt most feel doing this is minimal : ' i deserve it			0
' ' it makes me feel alive			0
' ' i 'm a great wife and mother , this is for me '			0
' he 'll never find out - who am i hurting ? ' ' why give up something which gives me intense pleasure ? ' women are better at having affairs , says @entity0 , pictured affairs are becoming less about filling an ' emptiness ' in the marriage and more about sexploration			1
a case of wanting the cake and eating it too - with dessert wine , freshly brewed coffee , a cheeseboard with quince paste and oatcakes , hand - rolled @entity93 chocolates , liqueur and ( oh go on then ) a post-dinner / coital fag as well			0
it 's about having the basics ( long - term security ) as well as the trimmings ( exciting bits )			0
the lot - and then some			0
it 's easy to look in and judge these relationships as outrageously selfish and ' bad '			2
but if they 're not found out , the long - term partner in these circumstances often benefits as well			0
their wife walks around whistling , full of the joy of life and if his libido is low , he appreciates not being nagged for sex ( even if a little part of him wonders why )			0
even if the man has a high sex drive , it 's rare they 'll miss out on what was on offer before because having sex outside the marriage often sparks a higher desire for sex generally			2
of course the whole thing topples - usually in a spectacular and devastatingly disastrous fashion - if the infidelity is found out			0
but here 's the irony : turns out women are n't just playing men at their own game of cheating , they 're better at it			2
women are better at keeping secrets and covering their tracks , so less likely to be discovered			2
the old perception about affairs was that women did n't have as many as men because they 're in control of themselves sexually and men are n't			1
the uncomfortable truth is , given half the chance , women cheat as much as men do			2
the difference now is we 've got just as many opportunities as he had			0
