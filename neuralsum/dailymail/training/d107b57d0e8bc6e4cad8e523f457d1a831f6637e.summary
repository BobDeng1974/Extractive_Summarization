@entity17 , from @entity18 , weighs in at 4st 6lb , which is 50 per cent heavier than she should be			2
@entity5 is a third heavier than she should be at more than 7lb – mainly due to a taste for popcorn			2

his owner @entity77 , from @entity69 turned to the @entity9 after she found it easier to pick up her one - year - old granchild than her chubby cat			1

' he 's also very greedy			0
i have another cat , @entity100 , who is the perfect weight			1
but i have to put her food away when @entity48 's about because he will steal it			0

we 've now cut the treats right back but we have been feeding them portions that are probably too large			0
@entity117 says that she had no idea that some of the treats she was giving to her bunnies were so fattening			0
' i 've tried to cut down on the carrots and apples , as i 've recently learned that they are both high in sugar and not the healthy snacks i thought they were			0
