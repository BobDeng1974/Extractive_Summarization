one mother has revealed how she makes butter out of her own breast milk			1
@entity3 , 26 , of @entity4 , @entity5 , shared pictures of her creation on @entity8 , calling it ' butter that i made without ever leaving my house ! pretty cool			1
' describing the flavor afterwards , she told @entity15 : ' it was very sweet and it was very creamy - it was really good			0
the idea occurred to her when she was home alone for the first time since her daughter was born			0
' i needed to make sure that i kept my milk production up , ' she says			0
' so i was hand expressing into a little container and then i remembered one time i was at a fair and they had a butter - making contest , where they had milk in jars and you shook it			1
' so i wondered if you could do that with breast milk			2
i looked it up online and sure enough , you could and i did it			0
' sole ingredient : ms @entity3 started with a container filled with her own breast milk more volume : she then moved it to a larger container , and continued to add milk she says the first time she tried it , she used about two ounces of milk , and after she shook it for about 45 minutes , the first butter began to form			1
she shook it for another 15 minutes , which yielded a small amount of butter - the size of a soybean			2
' the next day , i put a little bit of milk in the fridge overnight and i added to that the next day , but a lot more - closer to eight ounces - and i started shaking			2
and that time , within about two minutes , i had butter , ' she says			0
ms @entity3 says the result was ' not all that different from regular butter			0
' solid goal : after vigorous shaking for 45 minutes , the butter began to form and she placed it in this pan i ca n't believe it 's butter : ms @entity3 spoons up some of the final product while another @entity8 user claimed to have made cupcakes with breast milk butter and fed them to her family , ms @entity3 said she has n't shared hers with anyone else , and prefers to save her milk for her daughter			1
ms @entity3 says she posted the photos on @entity8 because she thought others might find them interesting she adds : ' i think the idea of an adult person consuming breast milk or a product of breast milk is sort of novel , so people are unsure how to react to it			1

@entity3 of @entity4 , @entity5 , discovered that all it takes is vigorous shaking to turn breast milk into butter
she was *inspired* to try the *experiment* after witnessing a butter - making contest at a fair that involved shaking jars of milk
