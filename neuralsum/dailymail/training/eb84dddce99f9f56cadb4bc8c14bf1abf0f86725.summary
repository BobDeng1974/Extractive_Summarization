the head of @entity2 ’s secret service has claimed rebels intended to down a @entity5 airliner to give @entity6 a pretext for invasion – but blasted @entity9 out of the sky by mistake			1
@entity12 said that @entity5 - backed fighters were supposed to take their @entity15 rocket launcher – which had been transported across the @entity5 border – to a village called @entity18 in @entity2 - held territory west of @entity20			1
instead , they mistakenly positioned it in a rebel - controlled village of the same name to the east of the city			2
crucially , the crash site would have been in @entity2 - held territory			2
the mass killing of @entity5 tourists could then have been blamed on the @entity2 army , giving @entity39 a justification for invasion , said mr @entity12 , head of the @entity2 intelligence service , the @entity49			1
‘ this cynical terrorist act was intended to justify an immediate military invasion by the @entity5 , ’ he said			2
@entity37 flight @entity52 was close to @entity55 flight @entity54 when it was blown out of the sky on july 17 , killing all 298 on board , he said			1
‘ it is incredibly cynical that the act of terrorism was planned against peaceful innocent @entity5 citizens who were on the way to their holidays with children , ’ added mr @entity12			1
he claimed this was a significant conclusion of @entity68 ’s probe into @entity9 ’s downing			0
last night there was no independent confirmation of the claim by the @entity49 , formerly part of the @entity74 but now closely co-operating with @entity76 intelligence agencies			0
there are no fewer than seven villages called @entity18 in @entity20 region , and the rebels chose the wrong one – close to @entity82 – to site the mobile @entity15 system , according to the theory			1
the @entity49 say that they have given evidence of their ‘ wrong village ’ allegations to the @entity88 - led team leading the investigation into the crash			1
tensions : the offensive in @entity2 continued last night amid claims @entity5 was preparing a military invasion ' immense convoy ' : @entity68 - sent troops paraded down a road near @entity20 allegedly heading off @entity5 troops the news came as tensions in @entity2 rose yesterday after claims @entity5 was preparing to stage a military invasion in the guise of a ‘ humanitarian ’ mission , which @entity5 has been repeatedly calling for in the east of the country			2
an ‘ immense convoy ’ comprising ‘ troops and military hardware ’ was thwarted from entering the country early yesterday , according to a senior @entity2 official , amid fears of a full - scale war breaking out			0
@entity115 and the @entity116 warned sending @entity5 troops in a ‘ humanitarian ’ mission would be ‘ unjustified and illegal ’			0
a rebel leader in @entity20 has claimed the city is surrounded by @entity2 forces and that his troops are willing to accept a ceasefire			0
but observers warned that it may be a tactical move laying the groundwork for @entity5 intervention			0
the @entity49 separately claimed that president @entity6 had sent his crack @entity128 to the village of @entity130 in @entity5 ’s @entity131 , six miles from the border			1
other brigades from @entity134 have been posted close to the frontier , to join tens of thousands of troops already in the area			0
‘ the personnel of these compounds are preparing firing positions and equipping field camps , ’ said @entity138 of the @entity139 and @entity140 .			0

@entity12 said @entity30 rebels hit wrong civilian plane
claims they were aiming for @entity39 airliner so @entity6 had reason to invade
would have hit an @entity37 flight from @entity39 to @entity40 in @entity41 , he says
