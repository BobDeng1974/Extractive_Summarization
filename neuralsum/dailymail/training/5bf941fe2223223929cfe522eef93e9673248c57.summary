they are the heavyweights who lead the world ’s 20 major and emerging economies			0
but just how intimidating are the @entity5 political giants in person and does their stature really make them more authoritative leaders ? @entity10 prime minister @entity9 stands at 5ft 9in , while @entity11 - the @entity12 president who @entity9 threatened to ‘ shirtfront ’ over the downing of @entity17 flight @entity15 - is just 5ft 7in			1
however , both are often photographed with their shirts off and make - up for their moderate heights by taking pride in their sporting prowess and martial arts history			0
and while some of the myths around @entity11 are difficult to take seriously - he purportedly ' saved ' a tv crew from a tiger several years ago - in reality , he is a judo master			0
@entity48 prime minister @entity47 and @entity29 president @entity28 - vertically gifted politicians - are taller at 6ft 1in , and both take a more leisurely approach to life than @entity11 and @entity9			1
@entity28 is often spotted on the golf course – even on the same day that he addressed the @entity54 beheading of top @entity29 war correspondent @entity55			2
and @entity47 is the master of ‘ chillaxing ’ , a phrase he coined to describe his time out on the tennis court or watching a tv box set with wife @entity61			0
how do the @entity63 line - up ? from left to right : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity11 , @entity9 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity47 , @entity28 and the tallest of them all - @entity32 's @entity31 but even @entity47 and @entity28 are overshadowed by the tallest of all the @entity5 leaders to arrive in @entity71 this weekend - @entity32 ’s prime minister @entity31			1
the majestic 55 - year - old is a grand 6ft 2in and towers over the likes of @entity77 president @entity76 at 5ft 7in			1
with all that height , mr @entity31 is keen to remain stylish and is the first @entity32 prime minister to employ a personal stylist , @entity79 , to help co-ordinate his clothes			1
mr @entity76 , meanwhile , is the second diminutive @entity77 president in a row , but he is two inches taller than @entity84 , who was notoriously touchy about his size			0
in 2012 , @entity76 was left red - faced after an official visit to @entity87 when he was photographed next to rather taller guard of honour from the @entity90 of the @entity91			0
the guards ' sizeable bearskins made the president appear tiny in the pictures taken outside the @entity48 foreign office			0
@entity97 chancellor @entity64 is 5ft 5in , the same height as @entity100 ’s @entity99 , but they are both shorter than @entity103 ’s woman in charge @entity104 ( right ) , who is 5ft 7in @entity77 president @entity76 , is the second diminutive @entity77 president in a row , at 5ft 7in two of the @entity110 leaders at the @entity112 @entity111 , who lines up at 5ft 9in , and @entity114 ’s leader @entity67 , 5ft 10in – are both much taller than the average male citizen in their countries			2
an average @entity118 man is 5ft 6in , whereas an average @entity114 man is 5ft 7in			2
meanwhile , female heavyweight @entity64 is 5ft 5in , the same height as @entity100 ’s @entity99 , but they are both shorter than @entity103 ’s woman in charge @entity104 , who is 5ft 7in			0
proving that good things do n’t always come in small packages , the first world leader to touch down in @entity71 for the @entity5 , @entity123 ’s president @entity65 , is just 5ft 6in			1
@entity65 has faced multiple corruption claims , has been married six times and is estimated to have 20 children			0
@entity114 's prime minister @entity67 and his wife @entity130 ( @entity131 ) pose for a photo with @entity118 president @entity111 and his wife @entity133 at the @entity134 ( @entity134 ) summit on november 10			1
mr @entity67 is 5ft 10in and mr @entity111 is 5ft 9in @entity137 president @entity136 and president of argentina @entity99 will also make appearances at the @entity5 @entity140 ( @entity131 ) , @entity141 ( @entity142 ) , crown prince @entity143 ( r ) and @entity145 @entity144 ( @entity146 ) pose before a official diner at @entity148 in @entity149 , 19 june 2007			2
@entity68 stands at 5ft 10 in then there ’s , @entity68			0
at 5ft 10 in , he needs all the height and strength he can get to support his weighty black - haired goaty			0
but does a politician ’s size really matter ? according to a 2011 @entity29 study by dr @entity158 at @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161 , voters see tall politicians as the best people for the top job			1
dr @entity158 asked volunteers to depict leaders and ordinary citizens and 64 per cent of participants drew the leaders taller			1
‘ our ancestors lived in groups that were constantly engaged in conflicts that were resolved through physical violence , ’ said the psychologist in an interview with the @entity173			0
‘ if you are in a group and the enemy hordes are coming over the hill , what you want them to see is the big person out front so they know they face a tough battle			0
’ president of @entity192 @entity191 is one of four female leaders in the @entity5 and president @entity65 of @entity123 stands at 5ft 6in who wore it better ? @entity197 's prime minister @entity196 and @entity199 premier @entity198 will give their views at the @entity5 @entity203 prime minister @entity202 ( 2nd left ) is 5ft 10 in			1
he is seen here with other world leaders at the @entity207 in @entity207 's capital @entity209 on november 12 , 2014 in the @entity211 journal he said the findings of his ‘ @entity214 ’ study showed that not only did individuals tend to prefer leaders with greater physical stature but also ‘ that males with greater physical stature are more likely to think of themselves as qualified to be a leader and , through this increased sense of efficacy , they are more likely to demonstrate interest in pursuing a leadership position ’			2
the @entity5 leaders – in all their shapes and sizes – will descend on the @entity228 on 15 and 16 november to discuss the world ’s economic issues			1
the summit comprises of 19 countries - @entity100 , @entity10 , @entity103 , @entity32 , @entity118 , @entity77 , @entity97 , @entity203 , @entity137 , @entity199 , @entity114 , @entity192 , @entity27 , @entity12 , @entity145 , @entity123 , @entity197 , @entity48 , @entity29 - plus the @entity233			1
