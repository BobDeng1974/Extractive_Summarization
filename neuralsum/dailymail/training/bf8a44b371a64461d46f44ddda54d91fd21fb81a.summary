it is an astonishing new view of a unique nebula			0
researchers have used @entity4 's @entity3 to photograph the iconic @entity5 in a new , infrared light to mark the 23rd anniversary of the famous observatory			1
looking like an apparition rising from whitecaps of interstellar foam , the iconic @entity5 has graced astronomy books ever since its discovery more than a century ago			1
this thick pillar of gas and dust is sculpted by powerful stellar winds blowing from clusters of massive stars located beyond the field of this image			2
the bright source at the top left edge of the nebula is a young star whose radiation is already eroding the surrounding interstellar material			0
@entity3 has been producing ground - breaking science for two decades since its launch aboard the space shuttle discovery on april 24 , 1990			1
during that time , it has benefited from a slew of upgrades from space shuttle missions , including the 2009 addition of a new imaging workhorse , the high - resolution @entity39 that took the new portrait of the @entity5			1
the nebula is a favorite target for amateur and professional astronomers			0
it is shadowy in optical light , and appears transparent and ethereal when seen at infrared wavelengths			0
' the rich tapestry of the @entity5 pops out against the backdrop of @entity51 stars and distant galaxies that easily are visible in infrared light , ' said @entity4			1
the nebula is part of the @entity57 , located about 1,500 light - years away in the constellation @entity58			0
the cloud also contains other well - known objects such as the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , the @entity63 , and @entity64			0
it is one of the nearest and most easily photographed regions in which massive stars are being formed			0
spot the horsehead : a new view from @entity15 's @entity71 of the iconic @entity5 in the context of its surroundings			1
the @entity5 resides in the constellation @entity58 , about 1300 light - years away , and is part of the vast @entity57			2
to the left , the panoramic view also covers two other prominent sites where massive stars are forming , @entity79 and @entity80			0
in the @entity3 image , the backlit wisps along the @entity5 's upper ridge are being illuminated by @entity84 , a young five - star system just out of view			1
along the nebula 's top ridge , two fledgling stars peek out from their now - exposed nurseries			2
scientists know a harsh ultraviolet glare from one of these bright stars is slowly evaporating the nebula			0
gas clouds surrounding the @entity5 already have dissipated , but the tip of the jutting pillar contains a slightly higher density of hydrogen and helium , laced with dust			2
this casts a shadow that protects material behind it from being stripped away by intense stellar radiation evaporating the hydrogen cloud , and a pillar structure forms			0

this three - panel image shows the latest near - infrared @entity3 image of the @entity5 in context with the new wide - field @entity124 view of the surrounding environment at far - infrared wavelengths .			1
