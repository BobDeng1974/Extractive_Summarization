five pounds does n't get you a lot these days			0
barely a pint of beer , let alone a square meal			0
but those who parted with a fiver at @entity7 on wednesday night were handsomely rewarded			0
for their admission money , they saw a quite brilliant @entity11 semi-final			0
the academies of @entity13 and @entity14 boast some of the most - gifted teenage players in the country and how they delivered here - 90 minutes of end - to - end football and seven goals			1
and on the day chancellor @entity21 promised the public would soon have a few more spare fivers in their wallets and declared @entity26 the ' comeback country ' in his budget , @entity13 were the ' comeback kids '			2
@entity13 @entity29 scores from the penalty spot against @entity14 @entity13 : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 ( @entity37 77 ) , @entity29 ( c ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 71 ) ; @entity40 ( @entity41 90 +3 ) , @entity42 , @entity43 subs not used : @entity45 ( gk ) ; grant scorers : @entity43 40 , 51 ; @entity40 44 ; @entity29 54 , 71 ( pen ) booked : @entity31 , @entity37 @entity14 : @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 68 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 77 ) ; @entity59 ( c ) , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 77 ) subs not used : @entity64 ( gk ) ; @entity65 scorer : @entity60 32 , 83 ( pen ) booked : @entity54 , @entity60 referee : @entity37 attendance : 3,666 trailing by two from the first leg at @entity71 , the defending champions were on the ropes when @entity60 extended @entity14 's advantage with a spectacular opener			1
but thanks to doubles from @entity43 and @entity29 , plus another from @entity40 , @entity13 roared back to recover the deficit , offset @entity60 's late reply , and reach a fourth consecutive final			1
and with talents such as this , they 'll be in the black for many years to come			0
@entity85 are likely to be their opponents , they lead @entity87 3 - 0 from the first leg			1
but , as was shown here on wednesday night , that kind of lead can count for little			0
somewhat bizarrely , @entity13 's head of youth development @entity94 was formally presented with the @entity11 trophy for last season 's triumph by two @entity11 suits in the press room ahead of the match			2
it was a very belated coronation , some 10 months after they edged @entity102 in a rollercoaster final here			0
this game definitely had echoes of that memorable occasion			0
@entity43 scores against @entity14 at @entity7 @entity43 scored either side of half - time as @entity13 fought back from 3 - 0 down in tie but while @entity115 had another addition for the burgeoning academy trophy cabinet , @entity13 's grip on their crown had been loosened by @entity14 in the first leg , goals from @entity112 and @entity62 gave the north @entity119 a commanding lead at tie 's midway point			1
and in the opening stages , the visitors looked the more likely to extend that advantage as long - range sighters from first @entity59 and then @entity60 forced goalkeeper @entity31 into evasive action			1
but as they had in the first leg , @entity13 soon began to dominate possession , largely reducing @entity14 to a counter-attacking role			1
@entity35 , the @entity130 under 17 international , was fleet - footed down the left , swapping lightning - quick passes with his colleagues and darting beyond @entity134 at every opportunity			0
@entity40 rammed the ball home from close range for @entity13 's third goal @entity40 's strike just before half - time put @entity13 level at 3 - 3 in the tie his whipped crosses were causing a headache for @entity14 keeper @entity49 - one in the sixth minute was comically bundled into his own net under pressure from @entity148 , the referee sparing his blushes			1
and another on the half - hour had to be acrobatically pushed to safety			0
but that agility was matched by the impressive @entity60 moments later			2
when @entity57 hooked a half - cleared corner into the danger zone , the @entity14 starlet watched the ball 's flight like a hawk before pivoting and volleying it home left footed while falling backwards			1
it was a goal that had the vine - makers reaching for their smartphones , rushing to share the moment on social media			0
@entity60 appreciated his goal 's importance in the context of the tie , @entity14 now three goals to the good			1
@entity13 defender @entity33 looks composed in possession but we have learned never to write off any @entity13 team and , as half - time approached , they suddenly snapped out of the malaise and raised their game to another level			1
five before the break , @entity43 gave them hope of a comeback when he turned in @entity40 's accurate delivery from the right - side and the crowd was buzzing when @entity40 rammed the ball home from close range minutes later			1
it will have delighted those charged with nurturing a new generation of @entity194 talent to see those two names on the scoresheet			0
it also continued @entity43 's marvellous run of scoring in every round of this season 's @entity11 , eight goals in total			1
spurs were shell - shocked and simply could n't stem the @entity206 waves at the start of the second period			0
eight became nine when @entity43 powered home a header to level the aggregate score on 51 minutes			2
@entity29 celebrates his second goal and @entity13 's fifth during @entity11 semi-final and when the excellent @entity13 captain @entity29 caught @entity49 dozing with a smart curling free - kick from 30 yards , they led for the first time after 144 minutes of the tie			1
the hosts were rampant though @entity14 may have levelled things again when @entity220 fired against the post from a low @entity223 cross			2
@entity13 knew they would feel more secure with a fifth goal and it duly arrived when @entity226 clumsily clipped @entity32 inside the box			2
@entity29 , who did n't put a foot wrong all night , coolly stroked home the penalty			1
but that security was short - lived			0
with eight minutes to play , @entity33 was adjudged to have handled on the floor as @entity60 tried to weave his way to goal			2
the @entity14 man ultimately found it from 12 yards but they could n't get another to force extra time			0
incredibly , this was the fourth time these two teams have met at under 18 standard in the past 19 days			0
spurs must be well and truly sick of their blue - shirted foes			0
for @entity13 , yet another final beckons			2
@entity243 of @entity13 tries to tackle @entity244 @entity60 celebrates scoring opening goal in the 32nd minute			1

*holders* @entity13 fought back from 3 - 0 down in the tie to reach the final
@entity43 and @entity29 both scored twice for the @entity251
@entity60 opened scoring and gave @entity14 hope with late penalty
