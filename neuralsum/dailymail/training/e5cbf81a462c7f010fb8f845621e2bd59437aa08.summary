by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 09:46 est , 15 june 2012 hundreds of homeowners will share £ 1million compensation from @entity3 after noise and fumes from a second runway slashed the value of their homes			1
nearly 600 homeowners will receive £ 1,500 each - 11 years after the runway first opened in 2001			1
the payout marks the end of the long - running legal battle which has seen the airport pay out more than £ 9million compensation			1
payout : @entity3 will hand over £ 1million compensation split between 583 homeowners at the end of an 11 - year legal battle the 583 households in @entity21 and @entity22 who lodged claims will receive the new payout			1
the airport will also pay the council tax precept , which is levied to fund @entity21 town council and @entity22 parish council , for one year			2
this will be worth £ 117,702 in total - and will benefit every household in the area			1
six local state schools will also receive a £ 1,300 one - off payment after the deal was struck			1
chancellor @entity36 , whose @entity38 constituency covers the area , said the compensation payout was a ' good outcome ' for property owners			1
airport chiefs had said they would not hand out any more cash because a legal time - limit for claims had passed			0
campaigners from the @entity48 , led by @entity21 resident @entity49 , and mr @entity36 held talks with airport bosses to try and secure a fresh pay out to those who had not submitted claims before the 2010 deadline			2

i want to thank local people for their support and @entity49 for all his work - he has been a star			2
at last we have a fair deal for local communities			0
' mr @entity49 welcomed the compensation settlement - and said it would end a decade of campaigning			2
' it ’s an acceptable deal , ' he added			0
' we were totally reliant on the airport ’s good will because legal timeframes for compensation had passed so this was a fair solution			0
' i do n’t think it is tokenistic but some people may be a little disappointed at the amount - they probably wanted a little more			0
we ’ve taken extreme care to get this right and this now draws a line under the second runway issue			0
' a spokesman for @entity3 said : ' the legal process for runway 2 claims formally concluded in 2010			0
however , since then , @entity36 and @entity49 have presented us with a convincing case which showed inequity in the legal process			2
' we have now agreed with them a final package of benefits as a goodwill payment			0
' we hope that this demonstrates our commitment to work with our local communities as a responsible business and finally draws a line under this process			0
