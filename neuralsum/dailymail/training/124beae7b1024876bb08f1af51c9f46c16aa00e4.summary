by @entity0 heavy snorers are twice as likely to suffer a deadly stroke as those who sleep peacefully , research shows			1
a major study of more than 25,000 people found the risk of a fatal blood clot more than doubled if someone snored through the night			1
they were also 80 per cent more likely to have heart disease , researchers found			1
a major study of more than 25,000 people found the risk of a fatal blood clot more than doubled if someone snored through the night the alarming findings , published in the @entity16 , suggest the dangers of heavy snoring are greater than previously thought			1
around three million people suffer with the snoring condition sleep apnoea , with one in four men and one in ten women affected			0
as sleep begins , the muscles in the airways relax			0
while this does not pose a problem for most people , in sleep apnoea it leads to breathing being shut off for at least ten seconds			0
@entity31 vibrates against the soft tissue that stands in its way , causing the characteristic ‘ rasping ’ sound that snorers make			2
once the brain realises breathing has stopped , it sends out a signal for the airway muscles to contract again			0
this opens the airway and the sufferer normally wakes with a jolt			0
scientists think that the problem stems from the blood flow to the heart and brain being affected by constant breathing interruptions in mild sleep apnoea , this can happen once every ten minutes			1
but in more severe cases , it means sleep can be disturbed every couple of minutes			0
treatment usually involves sleeping with a mask that pumps air into the throat			0
but tens of thousands of sufferers are thought to go untreated , and the latest study suggests that the dangers to the heart and brain are greater than doctors thought			1
scientists from @entity68 in @entity69 came up with their findings after pooling data from 12 earlier studies			1
the results showed strokes were twice as likely in heavy snorers , but mild snorers faced no increased risk			2
scientists think that the problem stems from the blood flow to the heart and brain being affected by constant breathing interruptions			1
but it may also be due to the fact that heart rate and blood pressure are repeatedly jolted out of their naturally lower state during deep sleep			2
strokes hit 150,000 people every year , with 30,000 being fatal			0
only cancer and heart disease kill more people			1
the researchers said : ‘ patients with sleep apnoea will be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease , stroke and death			2
’ @entity102 , senior cardiac nurse at the @entity103 , said : ‘ if you think you may have the condition , have a chat to your doctor			0
' for many people , it is linked to risk factors for your heart , such as obesity			2
‘ so it ’s likely your doctor will help you think about lifestyle changes to improve the condition , such as making sure you take regular exercise			0

scientists from @entity68 in @entity69 came up with the findings
study found that snorers are 80 per cent more likely to have heart disease
