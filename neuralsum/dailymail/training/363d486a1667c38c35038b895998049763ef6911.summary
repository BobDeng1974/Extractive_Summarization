@entity9 lost twice the amount of blood in her body after baby @entity22 's birth and says she is still traumatised at the thought of childbirth she feared she would die before she had the opportunity to hold her son , @entity22 , but doctors were able to save her life using expanding glue			1
mrs @entity9 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , went into labour in november last year and was taken to @entity33 in @entity34			2

just minutes after coming around she started haemorrhaging and was whisked straight back into theatre			1
she said : ‘ i still get flash backs from the event			0
it was horrific , i had no idea what was happening i just felt warmth between my legs and then i was rushed straight to theatre			2
‘ all i wanted to do was hold my little boy - i did n’t even know if he was okay			0
@entity22 was delivered by c - section and after the operation mrs @entity9 started to haemorrhage			1
she lost 17 pints of blood and had to be given multiple blood transfusions at one point , mrs @entity9 's husband , @entity53 , was warned that she might not pull through ‘ i felt as though i was dying			1
i remember just praying that i would survive so that i could see my son			0
‘ i do n’t remember a thing but apparently i kept asking if i was dying			0
at first i thought i was weeing , i never imagined i was haemorrhaging			0
‘ i had only just woken up from the operation so i had n’t even held @entity22 yet when i was whisked away to the emergency room			2
‘ i barely remember what happened because i was in such a state of shock			0
one minute i had just given birth and the next doctors were rushing around me			0
‘ my husband was looking down and told me there was blood everywhere			2
after that i blacked out , but he has told me i kept waking up and saying “ do n’t let me die ”			0
’ mrs @entity9 remained in the emergency room for five hours and underwent several blood transfusions while doctors tried to stop the bleeding			1
mrs @entity9 says she now has a phobia of childbirth and is terrified of every having another baby mrs @entity9 ( pictured with her husband , @entity53 ) had to spend time in intensive care after the birth and it was six days before she could hold @entity22 for the first time in all , the blood from 17 different donors , were given to her			1
at one point doctors told her husband , @entity53 , 27 , a business account manager , that it was touch and go whether she would make it			1
thankfully , doctors found the tear in her uterus just in time and managed to stop the bleeding using special expanding glue			1
after the operation , mrs @entity9 was taken to intensive care before being transferred to a high dependency unit for four days			2
it was n’t until six days after the birth that she was able to hold baby @entity22 , now five months , for the first time			2
she added : ‘ i was taken to the baby unit in a wheelchair because my legs were swollen from the blood transfusions so i could n’t walk			1
mrs @entity9 ( pictured with @entity22 and her husband , @entity53 ) said : ' i 'm so glad i pulled through , and having little @entity22 was worth it - but i 'm never having any more children			1
i still wake up with nightmares and i 'm terrified of every getting pregnant again in case the same thing happens ' ‘ holding him after everything was amazing			0
he was two days old and i could n’t believe how tiny he was			0
‘ looking at him for the first time made me forget the hell i had just been through			0
’ after the terrifying event , mrs @entity9 stayed in hospital for two weeks so that she could be monitored before being sent home			2
the lifesaving treatment left her body swollen for weeks , though she has since made a full recovery			1
mrs @entity9 added that she was so traumatised by the event she is unlikely to ever have children again			2
she said : ‘ i ’m so glad i pulled through , and having little @entity22 was worth it - but i ’m never having any more children			1
‘ i still wake up with nightmares and i ’m terrified of every getting pregnant again in case the same thing happens			0
mrs @entity9 ( pictured with her sister , @entity124 , when she was seven months pregnant ) says that if it were n't for all of the blood donors who saved her life , @entity22 would now be without a mother ‘ @entity22 is a perfectly healthy little boy now , and i am a healthy woman			1
we have a great little family unit			0
‘ i had no idea that it was possible to be given that much blood			0
i have 17 people who have saved my life			0
‘ if they had n’t donated their blood when they did , there might not have been enough available and my child would be without a mother			0
’ dr @entity142 , consultant obstetrician at @entity33 , said : ‘ seventeen pints is a significant amount of blood to lose during or after giving birth , and is thankfully a highly unusual occurrence			0
‘ in @entity9 ’s case , we used a special glue - like substance that temporarily blocked the blood supply to the uterus to stop the bleeding			1
‘ i am really pleased that @entity9 has recovered well			0
