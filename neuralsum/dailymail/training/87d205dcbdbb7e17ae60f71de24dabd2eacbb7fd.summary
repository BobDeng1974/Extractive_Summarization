by @entity0 published : 04:26 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 04:39 est , 28 may 2013 plants that were buried beneath glaciers in @entity3 more than 400 years ago , and were thought to have frozen to death , have been bought back to life by @entity3 scientists			1
samples of the moss plant , covered by the glacier during the @entity10 of 1550 to 1850 ad , were replanted in a lab at the @entity12 and grew new stems			2
researchers now think these findings could have implications on how regions across the arctic , and @entity18 , could recover as the ice covering them melts			1
@entity22 samples found in areas of the @entity3 arctic exposed as the @entity26 melts have been bought back to life			1
researchers from the @entity12 took the samples and grew cultures of the plants that were thought to have been buried during the @entity10 over 400 years ago			1
these are @entity32 , a relative of moss the @entity10 was a period of cold and freezing temperatures that is thought to have cooled the @entity36 between 1550 and 1850 ad			2
scientists believe there were three main cold snaps , one beginning about 1650 , another about 1770 and the last is thought to have occurred in 1850			1
it is believed to have been caused by either a drop in solar radiation , volcanic activity , changes in the ocean circulation or drops in the human population			0
the @entity10 brought colder winters to parts of @entity51 and @entity52			0
farms and villages in the @entity55 were destroyed by glaciers during the mid- 17th century			0
canals and rivers in @entity59 and the @entity60 were frequently frozen deeply enough to support ice skating and winter festivals			1
the first @entity64 frost fair was in 1607 and the last in 1814			0
during the @entity10 , the population of @entity66 fell by half			0
biologist dr @entity68 and her team at the @entity12 were exploring the region around the @entity26 on @entity71 in the @entity3 arctic			1
glaciers in the @entity3 arctic region have been melting at around four metres each year , for the past nine years			1
this means that many areas of land that were previously covered by ice have since been exposed			1
many ecosystems that were thought to have been destroyed during the @entity10 , between 1550 and 1850 @entity79 can now be studied			0
including many species that have never been studied before			0
while inspecting an exposed area of land , @entity82 and her team discovered a small patch of moss called @entity32			2
it is a type of bryophyte plant that mainly grows across @entity3 , the @entity91 , the highlands of @entity93			1
dr @entity82 noticed that the moss had small patches of green stems , suggesting it was either growing again or could be encouraged to repopulate			2
dr @entity82 told the @entity100 : ' when we looked at them in detail and brought them to the lab , i could see some of the stems actually had new growth of green lateral branches , and that said to me that these guys are regenerating in the field , and that blew my mind			0
' if you think of ice sheets covering the landscape , we 've always thought that plants have to come in from refugia around the margins of an ice system , never considering land plants as coming out from underneath a glacier			1
the small patch in the middle of this image is @entity32 , a type of bryophyte plant			0
researchers exploring the @entity126 on the @entity71 in the @entity3 @entity127 discovered that the plant had green stems			1
@entity129 can survive for long winters but scientists were surprised that the samples discovered were still green , even after being covered by ice for so long researchers from the @entity12 in @entity3 have been exploring the receding @entity126 in the @entity3 arctic looking for new life			1
the region is melting at around four metres a year ' it 's a whole world of what 's coming out from underneath the glaciers that really needs to be studied , ' dr @entity82 said			2
' the glaciers are disappearing pretty fast - they 're going to expose all this terrestrial vegetation , and that 's going to have a big impact			0
' the glaciers are disappearing pretty fast			0
' we really have not examined all the biological systems that exist in the world ; we do n't know it all			0
' dr @entity82 took samples of the moss and , using carbon dating , discovered that the plants date back around 400 years			2
this is thought to have been around the time that the @entity10 froze many parts of the world between 1550 and 1850 ad			0
dr @entity82 's team took the samples , ground up stem and leaf tissue and and planted them in dishes full of nutrient - rich potting soil			0
they fed the plants with water and managed to successfully grow 11 cultures from seven samples			2
the samples were from four separate species including @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172			0
the moss plants found are types of byrophytes			1
@entity129 can survive long winters and regrow when the weather gets warmer			0
however , dr @entity82 was surprised the plants had survived buried under ice for such a long period of time			1
@entity82 's findings appear in @entity182 .			2

@entity22 found buried beneath the @entity126 on @entity71 in @entity3 has been revived by @entity3 scientists
findings suggest that regenerated plants could help repopulate regions exposed by melting ice caps
