by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:06 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 02:07 est , 9 october 2013 middle class families today resemble the poorest @entity4 from the 1970s , former president @entity2 has claimed			1
@entity2 , 89 , said monday that growing economic inequality in the @entity4 has left middle class families financially unstable and eroded their economic security			1
' even in one of the wealthiest parts of the world there is a great deal of foreclosures and now a great deal of people who are fortunate to own their own houses owe more on them than the houses are worth in the present market , and that 's all changed in the last eight years , ' @entity2 said during an exclusive interview with the @entity1			0
the middle class has become more like poor people than they were 30 years ago			1
so i do n't think it 's getting any better			0
' @entity2 offered his assessment of the nation 's economic challenges monday at a @entity36 construction site in @entity37 , @entity38 - the first of five cities he and wife @entity42 plan to visit this week to commemorate their three - decade alliance with the international nonprofit that promotes and builds affordable housing			0
the recent economic downturn revealed that families living in even comparatively well - off , but expensive regions like the @entity49 are economically insecure , he said			0
taking a break from framing windows at a new 12 - unit town house development in a section of @entity37 where @entity36 already has built or repaired 115 homes , the 89 - year - old former @entity51 president said the federal government is investing less in affordable housing at a time of greater need			2
@entity2 said the poor were as well off when he was president as the middle class are now @entity2 blamed years of tax breaks for the wealthy , a minimum wage untethered from the inflation rate and electoral districts drawn to maximize political polarization			1
he said those factors have reduced the quality of life for all but a small fraction of @entity4 and imperiled the nation 's standing as ' a real superpower , ' he said			1
' equity of taxation and treating the middle class with a great deal of attention , providing funding for people in true need , like for affordable housing , those are the sort of things that would pay rich dividends for @entity4 no matter what kind of income they have , ' said @entity2 , looking relaxed in a baseball cap , blue jeans and white sneakers			1
' the richest people in @entity4 would be better off if everybody lived in a decent home and had a chance to pay for it , and if everyone had enough income even if they had a daily job to be good buyers for the products that are produced			2
