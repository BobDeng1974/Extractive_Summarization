by @entity1 reporter published : 11:08 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 11:32 est , 18 october 2012 a ten - year - old girl died following an epileptic fit in her sleep , after doctors ' missed opportunities ' to diagnose her with the condition , an inquest heard			0
@entity9 was found cold and unresponsive by her mother @entity10 on the morning of march 3 , 2011			1
despite her frantic father performing cpr and the efforts of paramedics who attended the family home in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity9 was pronounced dead at nearby @entity19 that morning			1
@entity9 had shown symptoms of likely neurological problems in the form of epilepsy before her death the @entity26 inquest heard that @entity9 had been to her gp surgery with slurred speech and pins and needles in august 2009 - where she was seen by a locum doctor			1
the locum doctor had written in her notes that he thought she had been dehydrated , adding ' refer to specialist ' - but this referral never happened , something which coroner @entity38 called a ' missed opportunity ” to diagnose her			1
her regular gp at the @entity43 surgery , dr @entity44 , was also unable to understand a memo the locum had written on @entity9 ’s notes - ‘ @entity48 ’ - which another doctor had to translate as ‘ see in an emergency ’			1
speaking through their representative mr @entity52 , @entity9 ’s mother and father @entity51 asked the gp why the locum ’s notes had not been followed up			1
mr @entity52 asked dr @entity44 : ' from his notes , do you believe the locum should do the referral or you ? ' to which the @entity41 answered : ' he should			1
' mr @entity52 asked : ' so if there was a suggestion that there should be a referral that was never followed up ? and if he does n’t then the suggestion just gets lost in the system ? ' dr @entity44 said : ' yes			0
' but coroner @entity38 also noted that @entity9 had been seen by a specialist after visiting the @entity72 in january 2010 when her parents said she had suffered a fit - but even after this she had not been diagnosed with epilepsy or put on any medication			1
he noted that she had been given a wake @entity78 ( electroencephalogram ) , which is used to pick up electrical activity in the brain , but not a sleep @entity83 when she was reviewed in a surgery a year later , it was found that she had not had any more episodes			0
prof @entity86 , an expert witness , said she thought @entity9 could have been suffering from @entity87 with @entity88 , which occurs in children after the age of five and usually stops when they reach 14 , and presents itself with pins and needles and trouble speaking , and in the majority occurs in sleep			1
prof @entity86 also explained that if @entity9 had been diagnosed with the epilepsy , there would have then been a discussion with the family about whether or not to place her on treatment			1
in her opinion , this would have been of comfort to the family			0
asked by the coroner whether the @entity41 should have referred @entity9 to a specialist after she visited in august 2009 , prof @entity86 said yes , but she also agreed with the statement that @entity109 were not specialists and could not be expected to know every symptom of every condition			1
a post-mortem examination found teeth marks on @entity9 ’s lip and tongue , which pathologist dr @entity117 noted was consistent with an epileptic fit , but added that there are few other signs after someone has suffered a fit			2
recording a verdict of death by natural causes caused by sudden and unexplained death in epilepsy , coroner @entity38 said : ' i ’m very conscious that @entity9 has showed symptoms of likely neurological problems in the form of epilepsy			2
@entity9 was declared dead at @entity19 in @entity26 in march 2011 ' she was seen by her gp on more than one occasion i think that there were indications there that would have been appropriate for her to be referred to the appropriate clinicians with expertise both in paediatrics and epilepsy for her to have been reviewed and followed up			1
' had that been the case then based on the fact that there were at least two events that were suggestive of some epileptic activity some diagnosis could have been made			0
' then , assuming this , there would have been a discussion about treatment and options			0
' whether that would have been putting @entity9 on some kind of medication would have been discussed			2
' i strongly suspect that @entity9 ’s parents would have had reassurance if there had been a positive diagnosis , and been a discussion of options			1
' as part of that a sleep @entity78 should have been performed			0
whether that would have been diagnostically helpful can only be guessed			0
i ’m troubled by the records of the gp , in particular when the locum doctor has made reference to a referral that did not happen			1
i would regard that as a missed opportunity			0
' but he added : ' bearing in mind even if @entity9 had had the review and even if she had been prescribed medication it would n’t necessarily have meant that should would have been saved			2
' the medication and treatment helps to alleviate the symptoms , it does n’t cure them			0
' speaking after the inquest , @entity9 ’s mother @entity10 , 37 , said : ' we ’ve been through hell since @entity9 died and we ’re still going through it			2
' @entity9 was a lovely , friendly girl who lit up a room when she walked into it			2
if she saw anyone upset she wanted to make it better			0
' the coroner talked about missed opportunities but the biggest missed opportunity is @entity9 ’s missed opportunities - she should have been at high school now , playing with her friends , spending time with her family			2
' we tried so many times to get answers - but no - one would listen to us			0
' teacher @entity10 , who is married to 59 - year - old @entity51 , a driving instructor , added : ' the inquest has n’t answered many of our questions ; it ’s just given up lots more			0
' a statement issued on behalf of the family added : ' further questions now arise as to the impact of the ‘ missed opportunities ’ and whether @entity9 would still be alive if appropriate action had been taken			0
' @entity208 also confirmed that the family will be pursuing a claim for medical negligence in respect of the treatment received by @entity9 concerning her undiagnosed epileptic condition .			0
