by @entity1 reporter published : 13:51 est , 20 january 2014 updated : 19:11 est , 20 january 2014 the @entity4 bobsled team are now headed to another @entity5 after the @entity6 offered to cover the travel costs for the team			1
@entity5 organizers said saturday that @entity4 has qualified for the two - man competition at next month 's games , and later announced that they will help meet some but not all of the team ’s financial needs			1
the team - which shot to popularity following the release of @entity17 , the 1993 film based on their story to make it from their tropical island nation to the slopes of the @entity24 - is still trying to raise money to pay for the equipment they will need to compete			1
represent : the team was larger in 2012 but are going to be there next month to wave their flag after this weekend 's ruling that they qualified for the @entity11 cool car : the bobsled used by the team in the @entity36 ( pictured ) used the colors of the @entity4 flag @entity39 , the sled driver , confirmed today that they are still raising money but has not said how much they need			1
on saturday , he estimated they needed $ 80,000 but that included the cost of travel			0
he said he has received calls from countless people around the world offering financial support			0
for a nation lacking bobsled tradition , or snowy winters , @entity4 has often fared quite well on the international circuits			2
watts finishing 28th at the @entity11 12 years ago , with @entity56 — now a key part of @entity59 's national team			2
@entity56 won a medal at the 2010 @entity61 , one where the @entity4 were hoping to compete but were again thwarted by funding issues			2
@entity63 and four - time olympic bobsleigh team member @entity65 said : ' i can confirm that we have qualified a team for @entity69 and it means a great deal that we are able to return to @entity5 competition after a few years of missing out			1
' ' there is still great enthusiasm for bobsleigh in @entity4 and we are making great progress with our funding			2
we will definitely be in a position to take part in the @entity11			0
' making an impact : the 1988 triumph was captured in a 1993 @entity82 movie called @entity17 the @entity4 team performed poorly at their second olympics in 1992 , but returned in 1994 , 1998 and 2002			1
still , the 46 - year - old @entity39 — who called himself ' retired ' from sliding for nearly a decade — has held on to hope of sliding again on the sport 's biggest stage			2
' we 're pretty good , ' @entity39 said			0
' we 're not there with the rest of the world , of course			0
but we if had some more sources for funding , we 'd have a better chance			0
' he started the season thinking he could get a four - man sled ready for @entity69 , before quickly realizing that was too expensive			1
changing it up : they only qualified for the 2 - man race and not the 4 - man sled as pictured here at a practice round in @entity105 in november financial concerns : @entity39 , the team captain , realized early on that he would not be able to get enough money together for a four man sled for the @entity69 games his focus then shifted to the two - man sled and by racing in a number of lower - tier events at tracks in @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity105 in recent months , @entity39 and brakeman @entity117 piled up enough points to get into the @entity5 mix. @entity69 officials tweeted word saturday that the @entity4 were in , but the @entity122 — the sport 's governing body — is not expected to confirm before sunday at the earliest how many nations qualified for the @entity5 fields			1
@entity39 said he 's confident that @entity4 is qualified			0
' i 'm not a person who likes to quit , ' @entity39 said			0
' i put my heart into it and i know for a fact that people are going to help this team			0

the @entity4 bobsled team will be competing in @entity69 after a 12 year *absence* from the @entity11
when they *debuted* in 1988 time they had a four - man team and this year will use a two - man crew
@entity5 organizers promised to pay for the travel costs but they are still *searching* for *backers* to help pay for the equipment that they need
the team shot to fame when their 1988 journey was turned into a @entity82 film in 1993 , called @entity17
