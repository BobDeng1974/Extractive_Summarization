the @entity1 administration has confirmed that it knew within 24 hours that @entity3 ambassador @entity2 had been killed in a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged by an anti-islam film			1
the @entity7 claimed for a week that the assault on the @entity3 @entity9 in @entity10 was ' spontaneous ' and sparked by the controversial movie , before finally admitting that the 9/11 anniversary attack was orchestrated by terrorists			1
but senior @entity3 officials have now confessed the government privately labelled the attack a terrorist act almost immediately after it happened , and even knew that the perpetrators had links to @entity20			1
the government had also been informed by september 12 that @entity3 intelligence agencies were hunting on specific suspect - militant @entity36 and @entity38 , who were likely responsible for the deadly attack			1
' no one ... believed that the mortars , indirect and direct fire , and the @entity46 were just the work of a mob -- no one , ' one of the officials told @entity28			0
but one intelligence official clarified to @entity28 there was not a ' definitive ' lead on who might have been responsible for the fiery attacks in the immediate aftermath , but that officials had an idea of the suspects			0
' it 's inaccurate to suggest that within the first 24 hours there was a definitive calling card and home address for the perpetrators of the @entity10 attack			2
potential suspects and data points emerge early on , but it still takes time to be certain who is responsible , ' the official said			0
deadly attack : the consulate was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack , which occurred on the eleventh anniversary of the september 11 terror attacks a congressional source said some members of the @entity77 found it ' shocking ' when cia director @entity79 told them three days after the attack that out - of - control demonstrators were responsible for the killings			2
meanwhile , more than two weeks after the strike , which killed @entity2 and three other @entity3 - the @entity83 has n't been granted access to investigate in the city and what 's left of the @entity10 consulate has n't been secured , according to @entity89			1
according to the tv station , law enforcement officials have reached @entity92 but they have n't made it to @entity10			2
' they had difficulty , and we understand there was some bureaucratic infighting between the @entity83 and @entity98 on the one hand , and the @entity100 on the other , and so it took them longer than they would have liked to get into country			2
they 've now gotten there			0
but they still are unable to get permission to go to @entity10 , ' @entity89 national security analyst @entity107 said			2
according to @entity89 , @entity83 agents have made a request through the @entity100 for the crime scene to be secured but that it has not happened			1
' the senior law enforcement official i spoke to said , ' if we get there now , it 's not clear that it will be of any use to us , '' @entity107 said			0
response : secretary of state @entity120 has promised a full and open inquiry into the attack , which occurred on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 mrs @entity120 , pictured earlier attending a @entity126 @entity125 meeting on peace and security in the @entity129 during the general assembly yesterday , secretary of state @entity120 admitted there was an explicit link between the @entity20 network in @entity134 and the deadly attacks on the @entity3 consulate in @entity137 , backtracking from what the @entity100 had said previously			1
speaking at a @entity125 meeting at the @entity126 , mrs @entity120 said an @entity141 - founded branch of the @entity20 network was situated in the area , using their location to plan and execute attacks , like the one in @entity10 on september 11			1
this goes directly against the initial statements of the @entity7 and president @entity1 , who acknowledged that the consulate attack , which killed @entity151 ambassador @entity2 and three other @entity3 , was a terrorist attack but that @entity20 ’s involvement 's was unclear			1
the secretary of state did not cite any new information to make these claims , the @entity154 reported			0
the @entity7 told reporters on tuesday that president @entity1 now believes the assault on the embassy was the work of a terrorist attack			1
‘ it is our view as an administration , the president ’s view , that it was a terrorist attack , ’ press secretary @entity163 said , according to @entity164			2
the @entity7 said that president @entity1 , pictured today at @entity171 in @entity172 , has now acknowledged the deadly attacks to be the work of terrorists the administration had initially said the violent and fiery attacks were fuelled by rage from an anti-islam film produced in @entity180			1
mr @entity163 said that ' there was no reason ( the president ) chose the words he did beyond trying to provide a full explanation of his views and his assessment that we need to await further information that the investigation will uncover			0
' the government 's admission comes after @entity151 president @entity193 claimed the deadly 9/11 anniversary attack on the @entity3 @entity9 in @entity10 was undoubtedly a ' pre-planned act of terrorism			1
' president @entity193 quashed the idea the assault on the consulate was prompted by the film ' , adding that he has ' no doubt ' it was a premeditated act of terrorism targeting @entity3 citizens			1
' it 's a pre-planned act of terrorism , ' he told @entity206 's @entity205 , adding that the anti-islam film had ' nothing to do with this attack			1
' terrorism : @entity151 president @entity193 , speaking to @entity206 , said he had ' no doubt ' the attack on the @entity3 @entity9 was pre-planned significant : @entity193 , pictured right with @entity205 , said the fact the attack occurred on september 11 was of great significance the @entity151 president 's remarks also come as a report in @entity218 claims @entity3 intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that the fire fight at the @entity10 consulate building was orchestrated by @entity20 - affiliates hiding in @entity137			1
unnamed officials said they had even tracked down the location of one suspect within this time , using social media			0
in the interview with @entity206 , @entity193 said the fact the attack occurred on september 11 was hugely significant , and provided further evidence that it was orchestrated by extremists rather than spontaneous protesters			2
he added that there were no protesters at the consulate before the assault , which he told the tv station came in two waves - the first involving rocket - propelled grenades on the consulate then with mortars at a safe house			2
' reaction ( to the anti-islam film ) should have been six months earlier			2
so it was postponed until the 11th of september			0
they chose this date to carry a certain message			0
' - @entity151 president @entity193 the @entity3 government initially denied that the attacks were planned , instead linking them directly to protests over the film			1
it was n't until late last week that the @entity1 administration formally acknowledged the deadly 9/11 assault was in fact a terrorist attack			2
@entity193 said the video had been available for months before the @entity10 attack and therefore was n't the catalyst			1
' reaction should have been , if it was genuine , should have been six months earlier			0
so it was postponed until the 11th of september , ' he told @entity206			0
' they chose this date , 11th of september to carry a certain message			0
' when asked by @entity205 what his evidence was that the attack was pre-planned , he said : ' @entity272 , is choosing the date , 11th of september has all the significance			0
if we take the facts about the way it was executed we can see there is enough proof that it is a pre-planned act of terrorism			0
' assault : the @entity3 @entity9 in @entity10 was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the september 11 attacks he said it was too early for him to give the minute details of the attack but he said the perpetrators must have had experience			1
' it was launched with a high degree of accuracy which means the perpetrators must have some kind of exercise on how to hit and how to launch these acts , ' he said			0
@entity193 said he thinks that @entity20 was behind the assault but he added there was so far no direct evidence to prove that is the case			1
' as the investigation progresses that is the likelihood we will reach that , ' he said			0
the @entity218 was the first to report that @entity3 intelligence agencies knew within 24 hours that @entity20 - affiliated operatives were behind the deadly assault			1
three separate unnamed officials told the website that early information was enough to show the attack was planned and orchestrated by groups in @entity137 linked to @entity20			2
they said @entity3 intelligence agencies developed leads on four of the participants within 24 hours of the fire fight that killed @entity2 as well as information management officer @entity317 and security personnel @entity318 and @entity319			1
destruction : a man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four @entity3 for one of the suspects , the @entity3 agencies were able to track his location using social media within that time			1
' we had two kinds of intelligence on one guy , ' the official told @entity218			0

these guys have a return address			0
there are camps of people and a wide variety of things we could do			0
