by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 12:50 est , 19 august 2013 @entity1 has been forced to reveal her net worth by submitting financial statements in order to be considered as the next @entity6 ambassador to @entity7 , and it is believed she may be worth up to $ 500million			1
the former first daughter 's wealth has been a closely - guarded secret for decades , but now that president @entity12 has nominated her to represent the @entity6 abroad , she has to list the sources of her massive income			1
' she ’s very rich , probably worth between $ 250million and $ 500million , ' said one legal expert who had seen the financial disclosure forms			0
in the spotlight : @entity1 's name has been submitted to be the first woman appointed as @entity6 ambassador to @entity7 @entity1 , who is the sole surviving member of former president @entity22 's immediate family , has avoided calls to publicly release her financial statements in the past , but as the @entity25 must now approve her appointment to be an ambassador , she has no choice			1
the closest she came to revealing her millions came in 2008 when she asked then - @entity31 governor @entity30 to suggest she take over @entity33 's empty @entity25 seat			2
at the time , she said she would reveal what board positions make her how many millions and exactly how much her family trusts earn in interest , but only if her takeover of the @entity25 seat was going to happen			0
it did n't , so the curtains surrounding her bank accounts remained closed			0
now there is no such justification for privacy , as she needs to reveal what ties she will be willing to cut in order to take the prestigious position			0
' i understand that a heightened prospect of a conflict of interest could exist as to companies that maintain a presence in @entity7 , ' she wrote in a letter accompanying her disclosure statements			2
according to the @entity56 , said conflicts could include a number of board and trustee positions that she olds with @entity63 's @entity1 school , her husband @entity65 's foundation , and the arts foundation created by her mother and father			2
connections : @entity1 has supported @entity12 in both presidential elections , seen left in 2008 and then with first lady @entity71 at her uncle 's funeral in 2011 ( right ) the biggest source of her income is from the extensive trusts that her grandfather @entity77 established for each of his children and grandchildren			2
the untimely deaths in her family have led to a piling up of respective estates , as her mother @entity85 inherited her father 's trusts after he was assassinated in 1963			1
after leaving the @entity89 , @entity88 married @entity91 shipping magnate @entity82 in 1968 , though he died less than seven years later in 1975			0
when he passed away , @entity85 was not entitled to as much as she would have been as a result of @entity91 estate laws , and after two years she agreed to accept a $ 26million settlement from her late - husband 's daughter @entity95 in return for giving up all claims to the family fortune in the future			1
@entity101 reports that her later relationship with financial planner @entity103 helped her build that payout from the @entity82 into an estimated fortune of anywhere between $ 100million and $ 200million , though it is unclear where that money went exactly as her final estate that was passed on to her children was significantly lower			0
@entity111 : @entity1 , seen on her mother @entity112 's lap beside her then - senator father @entity114 in 1960 , inherited the vast majority of her wealth second marriage : @entity88 married @entity82 in 1968 , and fought with his family for two years following his death in 1975 over her payout			1
@entity121 told she agreed to accept $ 26million from his estate back in @entity31 : she spent her final years in the company of @entity103 , who helped her grow her fortune that she eventually left to her two children key address : since leaving the @entity89 , @entity88 spent much of her later life in her 15th floor apartment on @entity132 in @entity31 's @entity133 @entity112 was diagnosed with cancer in 1994 and died four months later			1
she left her children an estimated $ 43.7million , including several pricey properties including her 15 - room apartment on @entity132 which had a view of the @entity139 , as well as the 366 - acre @entity1 estate on @entity141			1
in may of this year , @entity1 listed 90 waterfront acres of the property for sale - with no homes included - for $ 45million though it does not appear to have sold yet			2
she is still holding on to three lots of land for herself and her children , two that pay off the cost of estate expenses , and one that has been designated as open space			0
the @entity154 reports that the lots she is keeping for her family include the home that her mother lived in and designed			0
this is n't the first time that @entity1 has made a parcel off her mother 's property			1
@entity85 bought the 15th floor of her @entity132 apartment on @entity166 's @entity133 in 1964 following the president 's assassination , she paid $ 250,000			1
it sold for $ 9.5million in 1995 after her death to billionaire @entity171			2
@entity1 curse : @entity173 , seen here with his wife @entity175 just months before their death , left his estate to his sister @entity1 and her children and they had to pay the @entity183 family $ 15million following the fatal plane crash ' mrs. @entity82 was very conservative financially , and she did n’t spend much on it			1
we gutted the apartment and redid everything , ' he said to @entity189 after he decided to sell it for			0
on top of her own piece of the @entity1 pie , @entity1 also inherited her brother @entity173 's trusts when he died in a plane crash in 1999			1
he left his $ 50million to his relatives and a few charities , but the @entity198 are also believed to have paid the @entity183 family $ 15million as a result of the crash			0
@entity173 was the one piloting that fatal flight in his plane with his wife @entity175 and her sister @entity204 as passengers ; investigations into the crash reported that all three died on impact and the cause of the crash was pilot error			0
seclusion : the massive @entity1 estate in @entity141 keeps their family foothold in @entity216 private property : even though @entity1 has listed large portions of the property for sale , she will still have well over 100 acres to her name , not to mention the family house selling off land : in may , @entity1 listed two parcels of land totaling 90 acres for sale for $ 45million from the 366 - acre property that her mother bought in @entity141 back in the 1970s ( shown in 1981 ) ' from the figures , it looks like she earns between $ 12million and $ 30million a year from her trust and from her investments , ' an unidentified legal expert told @entity234			1
the interest yielded from those funds is hefty , but the 55 - year - old has not just been resting on those laurels			2
she has stakes in banks like @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and two oil companies that her family 's assets own			0
on top of those eight - figure sums , she also brings in an additional $ 1million from paid speeches and book royalties on a yearly basis			0
branching out : @entity65 's design firm is based in @entity31 so he is not expected to move to @entity7 alongside his wife of 27 years if she is confirmed as the ambassador to @entity7 surviving @entity198 : @entity1 , seen with ( left to right ) her children @entity256 , @entity114 and @entity257 , and her husband @entity258 , is the sole surviving member of former president @entity1 's immediate family she has been a perpetual consideration for a number of political posts over the years , but this one comes at a personal cost as her husband @entity65 will not be joining her in @entity267 since his design firm is based in @entity31			1
their 26 - year marriage has been the subject of speculation over the years since they are rarely seen together , but they were seen enjoying a beach vacation in @entity276 's over the girls ' spring break earlier this year			0
if the nomination goes through , she will become the first woman appointed to the post .			0

@entity22 's daughter is being forced to disclose her assets after being nominated to be the next @entity6 ambassador to @entity7
she will need to cut ties with any *organizations* thought to pose conflicts of interest if they have any offices in @entity7 or dealings with the country
@entity1 , 55 , inherited the estates of her mother @entity85 and brother @entity173 after their respective deaths in 1994 and 1999
she owns her mother 's 366 - acre @entity141 estate , and *previously* sold @entity85 's @entity132 apartment for $ 9.5m following her death
