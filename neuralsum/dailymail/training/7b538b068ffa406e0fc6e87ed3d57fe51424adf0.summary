by @entity0 the benefits of statins outweigh the risk of side effects , a group of health experts claim overwhelming evidence now shows that the benefits of statins vastly outweigh the risk of side effects , a group of health experts has claimed			1
six professors from @entity14 universities yesterday entered the growing debate about the use of statins , the @entity14 ’s most prescribed drug			1
many gps and patients are concerned about their over-prescription , which some say will needlessly expose people to side effects such as muscle pain and diabetes			0
but the group of leading cardiologists and epidemiologists dismissed fears about side effects as misrepresentative and misleading			1
professor @entity32 , clinical epidemiologist at @entity33 , said ‘ the jury is no longer out ’ on statins			2
he said : ‘ trials have shown unequivocally that statins reduce coronary heart disease mortality and there are very low levels of severe side effects			1
‘ we are not forcing these tablets down people ’s throats , we are giving people the evidence on which to make a decision			0
’ professor @entity32 added that a great root of the misunderstanding is that people on statins tend to blame the drug for any minor health problem			0
he said : ‘ because people have symptoms they look for an explanation and their doctors look for an explanation , and they attribute it to the tablet			0
’ their intervention comes just a fortnight before the @entity66 is due to publish new guidelines that will radically increase the use of the drug			2
the medication is currently only available to those at a 20 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade			1
some seven million @entity14 already take the drug			2
the new guidance will advise @entity19 to prescribe statins to anyone deemed to have a 10 per cent risk , which is estimated to increase the number on statins by up to ten million			1
the planned shift to ‘ pre-emptive ’ prescribing has led some gps to warn that many people will be given the drugs who do not need them			0
dr @entity86 , deputy chairman of the @entity87 , said : ‘ statins are very useful for people at high risk , those who have had a stroke or heart attack			1
new guidance advises @entity19 to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk , leading some gps to warn that people who do n't need the drug might be given it ‘ but to prescribe these drugs to those at low risk prompts a real concern we are over-medicalising and over-statinising @entity14			1
‘ statins definitely have side effects – that is what i have seen after 30 years of prescribing them as a gp			0
to say otherwise is just not true			0
’ but @entity113 professor sir @entity112 said trials have definitively shown that taking statins over five years increases the risk of side effects by less than 1 per cent			2
he added : ‘ it is n’t irrelevant to have a heart attack , it is a major life - changing event			1
‘ for many people a stroke is a life - changing event			0
to avoid these is important			0
‘ if one looks at the absolute risk , which is less than 1 per cent , and you look at the absolute benefit , the benefits in those terms outweigh the risk			0

six professors from @entity14 universities have dismissed fears about statins
comes as *chiefs* are due to publish new rules on statins prescription
will advise @entity19 to give them to those with 10 *%* risk or heart attack or stroke
