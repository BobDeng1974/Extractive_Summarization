by @entity0 published : 18:49 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 03:39 est , 21 may 2013 energy minister @entity1 is trying to recreate the success that @entity3 has had with fracking drilling for gas could take place across the south of @entity9 in the constituencies of 35 @entity12 mps			1
a new analysis of the areas where shale - a type of rock rich in natural gas - is plentiful and drilling licences have been handed out , covers the constituencies of several cabinet ministers			1
most are situated around the @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity24 including the seats of @entity27 @entity26 , cabinet secretary @entity28 , defence secretary @entity29 , justice secretary @entity30 and health secretary @entity31			0
last week , the energy department announced fracking , the controversial technique of extracting gas from rock , would go ahead in earnest in the coming months despite environmental concerns			1
energy minister @entity1 said the government ‘ owed it to the next generation ’ to explore new energy sources which may bring down household fuel bills			1
he told the @entity44 : ‘ let ’s get fracking			2
there has been a lot of interest already , particularly in southern @entity9 and we are hoping to attract the big firms to come and drill here			1
’ in the @entity3 fuel prices have tumbled due to shale exploration			0
on his trip to @entity55 last week @entity53 said : ‘ frankly , i am pretty jealous of your fracking success here in the @entity3			2
’ but fracking , which involves drilling a well thousands of feet underground , and pumping in water and chemicals at high pressure to crack the rocks beneath , is fiercely opposed by local residents and green campaigners			1
they say it will ruin the environment , creating traffic and pollution , and potentially contaminating underground water supplies , and increase @entity73 ’s dependence on fossil fuels			2
only one shale project is already underway , with the firm @entity76 which has wells near @entity78			0
the energy minister is proposing building facilities like this one in @entity81 , across the south of @entity9			1
an mp has said that people wo n't want to see gas production in the rolling hills of @entity23 the firm has another licence to drill at a beauty spot near @entity90 , @entity91 , but residents have pledged to ‘ fight it all the way ’			1
analysis by @entity95 show 38 out of 62 mps in the shale - rich south have land with existing oil and gas drilling licences - and 35 of them are conservatives			1
these are areas highlighted by the @entity73 @entity104 as having potential for shale , and a company which is or has expressed an intention to drill has a licence to exploit it			0
it was revealed last year that in the northwest , constituencies with shale gas licences include @entity113 , home of chancellor @entity115 , and north @entity116 , where @entity117 , environment secretary , is mp			2
some mps are already privately concerned			0
one @entity12 said : ‘ it ’s one thing to have fracking in the vast plains of @entity3			2
it ’s a whole different matter when people will see gas production in the rolling hills of @entity23			0
a new round of licences will be handed out next year			0
mr @entity1 said areas to be targeted are @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity91 , @entity131 , @entity132 and an area of the @entity134 and @entity135 known as the @entity136			1
cabinet ministers @entity29 and @entity26 's seats in @entity23 are likely to be hit by the drilling plans @entity31 and @entity30 are the mps for @entity23 constituencies			0
38 out of 62 mps in the south already have land with existing drilling licences the resource been hailed as an energy revolution which could reduce @entity73 ’s dependence on expensive imported gas , create tens of thousands of jobs and possibly lower household fuel bills			1
the @entity12 are determined to try and kickstart a shale gas revolution despite the reservations of energy secretary @entity154 who has said it will not be a ‘ silver bullet ’ and some energy expects saying it is unlikely to lower bills			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s not only growth and jobs but the potential for cheaper gas bills for households and industry which has already seen huge benefits in the @entity3			1
we owe it to the next generation to see if we can make that happen here			0
‘ it must be safe and properly regulated , and firms will consult the local community , which will receive either a direct reduction in their energy bills or a sizeable cheque for their local area			0
’ @entity95 energy campaigner @entity180 said independent experts at @entity183 , @entity184 and even mr @entity154 had all agreed it would not lower bills			0
he said : ‘ fracking clearly has the government ’s backing but it across the @entity12 heartlands , where so far it has been bitterly opposed			0
when this gets going it will make wind farms look like a walk in the park			0

energy minister @entity1 said @entity9 needs to ' @entity196 ' for new energy sources
drilling gas from rocks is a controversial practise , but could be *introduced* across the south of @entity9
many environmentalists and residents oppose fracking , which they say will ruin *countryside*
