it does n't happen often , but when four genuine striking superstars come together for 90 minutes you just have to sit back and enjoy			2
@entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and one @entity6 all under the same roof doing battle as @entity9 and @entity10 faced off			1
@entity6 , of course , sees himself as the main man in that quartet and rocked up at the @entity14 ready to dazzle on wednesday night			1
typically , he did n't disappoint			0
@entity6 celebrates putting @entity10 ahead at the @entity14 @entity3 ( right ) equalises from close range after good work from former @entity17 striker @entity5 @entity4 prepares to strike the ball from outside the box , with his superb hit flying in past @entity21 @entity5 added the third goal late on as @entity9 confirmed their place in the last 16 as group winners there is forever an air of @entity6 having something to prove when the @entity28 is back at his former club - something intensified with the presence of not just @entity3 but with his trusty attacking double - act as well			1
four stars at the peak of their powers would ordinarily be quite enough , but to see each score on the same night is something that barely ever comes round			0
the four were utterly dominant , a cut above the rest as @entity9 won 3 - 1 and maintained their spot as group winners			1
@entity6 put the visitors ahead , intelligently dropping off the front to wrong - foot @entity45			2
cue the brash leap in the air and pump of the arms ; he brings drama and it had real effect on @entity9 's stars			2
@entity3 and @entity6 embrace respectfully as @entity53 hugs the @entity55 magician @entity3 and @entity4 are a lethal pairing together - particularly when @entity5 is added into the mix @entity3 had quite enough of the attention centring on a visitor , gambling at the back post to equalise , while @entity4 scored the pick of the bunch			1
the @entity63 drove on from midfield , forcing the @entity10 defence to furiously backpedal , and bent a wicked effort from 25 yards			0
even @entity5 got in on the act , notching his second in @entity9 colours after @entity3 unselfishly allow the striker to tap in from six yards			1
but it is not just with their goals that set this quartet above the rest			0
@entity3 purred , getting himself on the ball consistently and trying to break the resistance @entity80 with a series of mecurial runs , while @entity6 's eyes lit up on more than one occasion as he peppered the home goal			2
these are the players you pay your money - around £ 100 for a ticket - to see			0
whether there will be many more occasions when four genuine worldbeaters score in the same game seems a tall order			0
a night to be treasured .			0
