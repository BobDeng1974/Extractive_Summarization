as @entity0 showed off her super-slim figure in a new @entity3 photo , many of her fans balked at her now tiny frame			1
for the @entity9 star , who has lost has lost two and a half stone and four dress sizes over the past year , is looking thinner than ever			1
in fact , she is looking so thin , that some have questioned whether the 24 - year - old actress has taken things too far			1
' but @entity25 is not the only @entity37 resident to have lost weight			1
her co-stars @entity41 , 27 , @entity42 , 22 , and @entity9 have also all dropped the pounds over the past 12 months			1
@entity25 has a lost a lot of weight over the last 12 months ( left , before the weightloss , and , right , after ) , she puts this down to exercise and having cut back on take - aways and booze @entity25 in 2013 before her weight loss transformation attending the @entity51 at @entity52 and the women are n't afraid to show off their bodies			1
@entity41 regularly posts then and now pictures of herself to her 1.6million @entity3 followers charting her weight loss progress			2
@entity42 and @entity9 are the same			1
sharing pictures of their super slim bodies , often in bikinis or skimpy outfits			1
but have these girls taken things too far ? well , one doctor thinks they might			1
dr @entity66 told us that there is a lot of pressure on women in the media to try and stay thin			1
@entity41 regularly posts pictures of herself to @entity3 , before ( left ) and after ( right ) her weight loss @entity9 said she felt compelled to lose weight after seeing that her fellow @entity76 had dropped so many pounds she said : ' there is too much too much pressure as they are in the public eye and understandably want to look good but it may push them into unhealthy eating patterns in order to achieve that look			1
' because of the pressure the weight loss can be taken too far and too fast as with many of the @entity9 girls			1
' she continued : ' when weight loss is very fast the body is encouraged to lose fat , muscle and water			2
water is just a temporary loss and you also do not want to lose muscle			2
' and for women it is important not to lose too much fat , because then periods will stop and it can affect not only fertility but also increase the risk of problems like osteoporosis because the woman has lost the protection of the female hormones			1
' @entity42 is the fourth @entity9 girl to dramatically lose weight , she had even posted a picture of herself trying out a waist trainer to @entity3 ( left ) @entity42 posted this picture of herself to @entity3 where he ribs are clearly visable @entity42 was larger when she started on the show , but , she has since slimmed down after revealing she felt fat dr @entity120 also revealed that it is best for fans to stick away from following celebrities in their diets			1
she said : ' it is better to choose a plan to suit your body and to take into account whether you have a sedentary job or working away from home a lot so ca n’t control your food easily			2
' it will make a difference if you are very stressed and also how old you are because metabolism tends to slow down as we get older			2
' it is important that you choose a diet that suits your lifestyle , age and how you want to look so that you do n’t end up looking and being too thin or causing health problems			2
' however two of the girls have hit back at the criticism of their weight			2
@entity42 told the @entity147 : ' what really annoys me is when i read articles and it 's like , " @entity42 lost three stone in one month " and that is giving such a wrong impression to the girls out there reading that and thinking , " oh yeah i can lose three stone in one month "			1
she continued : ' they just pluck these figures out of thin air , and it should n't be allowed to happen because that could have really damaging effects			2
' @entity25 has also denied losing weight just for her dvd : ' sadly i just put weight on through loads of partying , drinking , having a boyfriend and eating takeaways every night , ' she said			2
' i do n't know why i would ever want to put weight on and look that fat and ugly			0
why would anyone ever want to do that ? it 's so stupid that people even say that			0
' much has been made of just how the @entity9 girls , who were famous for their booze and take away heavy diets , have managed to loose so much weight			1
here 's what they 've said ... @entity18 @entity25 's diet was not the most conventional			1
as her @entity41 revealed that she uses a controversial sounding ' three tin ' regime			0
' she basically thinks you should eat three tins a day and that 's it			0
so you could have a tin of beans for your breakfast , tin of tuna for your dinner and a tin of pears for your tea , ' said @entity41			0
@entity25 also introduced exercise into her life to beat the bulge			0
she started working with celebrity trainer @entity205 and released a number one best selling fitness dvd			0

she said : ' i do work hard to maintain my body as i work with a personal trainer 2/3 times a week , and we train really hard together			0
' she also maintains a calorie - controlled diet and has previously revealed that she prioritises fruit and vegetables over stodgy treats			0
' carrots before carbs , ' she explains			0
' i 've been doing it for so long now that when i eat s * * * it makes me feel bad			0
i prefer to be healthy now			0
' a typical day for her would be scrambled eggs for breakfast , a chicken salad for lunch , and for dinner , steak and vegetables			0
@entity41 before embarking on her weightloss transformation @entity41 survived on a diet of takeaways			0
now , she 's a svelte size six after insisting that producers provide the reality show stars with a healthier menu - something she says has ' made all the difference '			0
' it ’s made such a difference , ' she says			0
' you do n’t get much time to cook , so we used to have a crisps cupboard and a chocolate drawer , which we 'd descend on like a pack of raccoons after a night out			0
' with the catering , we swapped our fry ups for eggs or porridge for breakfast and then salads and meat platters for lunch			0
that made keeping our figures loads easier			0
' @entity41 also followed the her own @entity269 routine , which she turned into a dvd , which saw her shed three stone over the course of six months			1
following her dramatic slim down she was unhappy with the way her breasts looked and had a boob job to plump them back up again			1
@entity41 posts these pictures to her @entity3 detailing how she has transformed her body @entity9 : @entity9 decided to lose weight at the end of last year after becoming jealous of her co-stars slim bodies			1
she dropped 17lbs - over a stone - in just one month and said : ' a lot of people started to pick up on my weight on @entity24 and say some really hurtful comments			1
' i remember one person said , " you used to be the skinniest and now you 're the fattest			0
" ' another said , " your face is huge , " because when i do pile on the pounds it always shows up really quickly on my face in the shape of a double chin			2
' there were also lots of comments about being be the " fat one " in the show and the " fat lass "			0
' i 'd be lying if i said those comments did n't really hurt - you try to ignore them but it is impossible			0
' after a month of intensive work - outs and eating healthily , the reality tv star went from 9st 10lbs to a super-slim 8st 7lbs .			2
