it appears @entity2 's little helper went overboard with the celebrations on christmas day			0
to get through working on one of the merriest days of the year , police on duty today have taken to social media to share a bit of festive cheer and a timely message for all			1
it all started with an anonymous tip from a man - who only wanted to be known as ' mr s ' - which led to the arrest of an elf for drink driving			1
police made no exceptions and caught the wayward elf in @entity23 - in the @entity24 which is north of @entity25 - and breathalysed him , where he blew mid-range			1
it was a parody with a serious road safety reminder for @entity57 motorists			2
' he [ the elf ] has had his free phone call and is now waiting in the dock to be charged , ' police wrote on @entity52			2
drink driving ... it 's a crime			1
' the elf , who 's sure to be on the ' naughty ' list next year , signed his licence suspension notice and was granted conditional bail			2
police wrote that the elf is expected to appear at the @entity71 on january 22 , 2015			0
senior constable @entity72 says in reality , mid-range drink driving can result in suspension of licence on the spot and a hefty fine - clearly not an ideal way to spend @entity40			1
' the @entity52 posts were all a bit of fun but is also a way for us to get the message across especially at this time of year , ' he told @entity85			0
and it was n't just @entity87 who had a bit of a laugh on social media			0
@entity57 police across the state took to @entity94 on christmas day , being prompted by @entity96 officers who asked : ' @entity97 , have you guys seen @entity2 yet ? ' in response to the question , @entity87 wrote : ' left cookies + milk ( full cream , skim & soy - we never know his tastes these days )			0
' ' we have made sure cookies are gluten free & our reindeer food organic , ' @entity110 also tweeted			0
@entity57 police across the state also had a bit of fun on @entity94 on @entity40			1

@entity116 , north of @entity25 , shared a bit of festive cheer and a timely message on @entity40
the parody was about a wayward elf who was arrested for drink driving
the elf , who has not been named , blew mid-range and had his licence suspended
police say motorists will face *similar* consequences plus a hefty fine
