by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 6 december 2013 updated : 19:51 est , 6 december 2013 millions of people with fixed price energy tariffs will not get a £ 50 reduction in bills promised by @entity5			1
the energy giant @entity6 yesterday announced that more than one million of its customers will get a reduction of only £ 12 – or 23p a week			1
@entity9 is taking the same line with its one million fixed rate customers , who include many pensioners and families			0
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 may follow suit			0
the decision is at odds with @entity22 promises and @entity23 , which announced a £ 53 cut for all customers			2
on average bills will be £ 60 higher than before this year 's round of price hikes even after the government deal to reduce green levies by £ 50 the prime minister , chancellor @entity32 and energy secretary @entity33 have made repeated pledges to protect customers by rolling back green levies			1
mr @entity32 said this week : ‘ there ’s going to be an average of £ 50 off people ’s bills … we are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in			1
’ last night , mr @entity33 ’s @entity43 made clear they expected all customers to get the full reduction			2
a spokesman said : ‘ we have announced a package that should lead to households seeing an average saving of around £ 50 a year			1
‘ there is no practical bar to these savings being passed on to consumers on fixed tariffs and our expectation is that all consumers will benefit from the £ 50 discount			1
’ the @entity59 energy firms have agreed to pass on the £ 50 saving to customers the smaller reduction of £ 12 covers the government ’s decision to switch funding of the @entity65 – a subsidy for poorer families – from bills to general taxation			1
the rest of the decrease was expected to come from changes to the @entity74 ’ obligation scheme , a levy applied to all bills to raise money for energy - saving measures for poorer households			2
however , this element of the reduction is not being passed on to customers on fixed tariff deals by some companies			2
in contrast , @entity23 , the largest of the ‘ big six ’ suppliers , announced that all customers on all tariffs and payment methods will get a reduction of £ 53 from january 1			1
@entity91 , of campaign group @entity92 , said : ‘ the message has been that people were going to save £ 50 on their energy bill , but it seems a fair chunk of people will not get that			1
this sort of behaviour is not going to do anything to reassure customers … people feel confused and angry about their energy bills			2
this latest development just adds insult to injury			0
’ she added : ‘ i think in the current climate , bearing in mind how people are struggling , the right thing to do would be to apply the full reduction across the board			2
that is the expectation that the government has created			0
’ @entity6 announced yesterday a price rise of almost £ 60 a year for customers on standard tariffs			1
the changes will take effect from january 18			0
a spokesman for the provider said cutting the bills of fixed price customers by only £ 12 was justified because many of these people were already on relatively good tariffs			1
@entity9 took a similar line and said its short - term fixed deal is some £ 90 a year cheaper than its new standard prices			0
chancellor @entity32 used his @entity129 to boast of cutting bills by £ 50 the simplest , and often best , way to slash your energy bills is to use an online service that can compare all the best tariffs on offer for you			1
