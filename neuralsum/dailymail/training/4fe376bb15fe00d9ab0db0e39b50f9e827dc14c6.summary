by @entity0 published : 20:39 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 10:03 est , 16 october 2012 just a few months ago this baby elephant was found alone and on the brink of starvation after being separated from its herd			1
but now this adorable calf has made an incredible recovery after being rescued by a charity for orphaned elephants in @entity10			2
baby elephant moses , named after another famous abandoned calf , has been adopted by the @entity13 where he is being raised by humans			1
going for a walk : seven - and - a - half month old orphaned elephant moses on his daily walk with pet dogs @entity21 , left , @entity22 right , and foundation owner @entity23 new home : a seven - and - a - half month old orphaned elephant calf named @entity26 cuddles his adoptive mother and @entity13 owner , @entity23 , at their home in @entity31 , @entity10 dinner time : moses drinking one of his two - hourly formula bottle feeds sweet dreams : moses in a makeshift bed with @entity23 as the baby elephant wo n't sleep alone the foundation described the heart - breaking moment abandoned @entity26 was found in february this year when he was just a week old by rangers at @entity45			1
a post on the foundation website blog says : ' @entity48 at @entity45 noticed a baby elephant on his own running around frantically trying to find his mother			2
the rangers monitored the baby and tried to locate the herd he belonged to without success			0
' a few days later , the rangers spotted the calf again in the @entity57 and his condition had deteriorated so much he was too weak to get out of the water			0
it continued : ' the rangers then decided to intervene and rescued the baby			0
thirsty : despite being brought up by humans , @entity26 should be able to return to the wild new surroundings : moses at his feeding place at the bottom of a staircase at his home in @entity31 , @entity10 new friends : baby elephant @entity26 makes his way into the kitchen with the sanctuary pet dogs , left , and is tempted with one of his foal milk formula bottles , right ' various parks and wildlife organizations were contacted and nobody was in a position to take the elephant			1
' @entity13 owner , @entity23 , was contacted about the baby calf and agreed to take on custody of the elephant on behalf of the @entity88			2
he had just a 20 per cent chance of survival but that has now risen to 50 per cent after several months at the sanctuary			1
she began feeding him a foal milk formula as elephants do n't start eating solids until they are eight months old			0
play time : @entity26 plays in a dust pit with carer @entity99 rescued : @entity26 was found alone and close to death in the @entity45 close pals : pet dog @entity102 licks up @entity26 ' spilled formula feed ms @entity23 also sleeps on a mattress next to the baby elephant as he wo n't sleep without having some form of contact similar to what he would have had with his mother in the wild			2
the orphaned elephants are raised at the foundation in @entity31 , @entity10 , in a way to ensure that they are physically and physiologically able to be released back into the wild			0
elephants need to live as part of a herd and other animals can make a good substitute			0
so @entity26 now also has several new friends - primarily two pet dogs at the sanctuary , @entity21 and @entity22			0
helping trunk : moses with carer @entity128 as he mops the floor at the sanctuary in @entity10 laid back : moses walking through the home with pet dogs that have now become his constant companions second chance : @entity26 now has a 50 per cent chance of survival after being rescued on the brink of starvation			1
