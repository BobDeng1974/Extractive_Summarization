@entity8 , 43 , has operated on the historic beachfront in @entity10 since 1987 as part of a family tradition			1
but mr @entity13 is now set to lose his licence as council officials have suddenly realised they should not be authorising him to drive his four - wheel carriage because he does not have a car licence			1
local legacy : @entity8 , 43 , has proudly carried excited visitors along the historic seafront in @entity4 , @entity10 , since 1987 mr @entity13 , whose horse is called @entity23 , went to @entity24 last week to submit a licence renewal application , as he has done regularly for a quarter of a century			1
but he was told he needed a motor vehicle driving licence , which he has never had			2
he now faces an agonising wait over his working future with the final decision being taken by the council 's licensing committee later this week			2
jeopardy : council officials have suddenly realised they should not be authorising him to drive his pretty four - wheel carriage because he does not have a car licence the horseman said his grandfather , father and three brothers have all pulled tourists in carriages along the seafront since the @entity43			1

that means a landau rider must hold both a @entity66 driver 's licence and @entity80 licence			2
@entity81 , licensing manager at @entity24 , said : ' it just recently came to light that it 's a matter of law , whereas before we did not require it			1
' it was just a case of officers not being aware it was the law			0
' it came to light because somebody else was trying to apply for a licence			0
' we made it policy for brand new applications a few years ago			0
' now i know i have to rectify it			0
we have checked and found that we were potentially in breach			0
