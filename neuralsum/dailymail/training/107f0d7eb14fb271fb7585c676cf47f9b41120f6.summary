in an attempt to get rid of ' gendered space , ' a school district in @entity1 has asked instructors to stop using words like ' boys and girls			1
' the @entity8 found the @entity10 system circulated a handout for the new year , telling teachers to use specific terms like ' purple penguins ' instead			2
the instructional handout , entitled ' 12 easy steps on the way to gender inclusiveness , ' listed step 2 as : ' do n't use phrases such as ” boys & girls , " ” you guys , ” ” ladies and gentlemen , " and similarly gendered expressions to get kids ’ attention			2
' inclusion : a handout circulated to teachers in @entity10 suggested using like ' campers ' to avoid gendered terms like ' girls ' and ' boys ' ' instead say things like ” calling all readers , " or ” hey campers " or " could all of the athletes come here			2
" create classroom names and then ask all of the ” purple penguins " to meet at the rug , ' it read			0
administrators at the district had focused on transgender students before the start of the school year in order to be able to spot issues before they arise			1
in addition to training , administrators passed around a profile of a transgendered person in the local news and @entity59 's cover story on the issue			0
one parent in the district worries that the training pushes an agenda , calling the change ' social engineering			0
' @entity67 , who has children attending high school and middle school in @entity10 , sent out three training documents in an email to other parents , calling them to join her at an october school board meeting			1
' by sidelining academic teacher training and replacing it with social re-engineering , the @entity10 administration has placed a higher priority on social reformation than on education , ' the email read			0
lesson plan : @entity67 says she has a child that attends @entity85 and opposes teachers receiving the handouts because they attacked ' religious values ' she included three handouts , at least two of which were circulated among staff at @entity10 that @entity93 said promoted ' the deconstruction of fundamental family and religious values			1
' ' the agenda we ’re promoting is to help all kids succeed , ” said @entity100 , @entity10 coordinator of social workers and counselors			0

the instructional handout for teachers was passed around as @entity10 administrators were trying to *sensitively* address transgender issues
@entity67 , a parent of children in the school district , sent an email in *response* to the handouts asking parents to show up at a school board meeting
@entity93 said the handouts were *taxpayer* - funded attempts to push for ' the deconstruction of fundamental family and religious values '
a study released in january found bullying and violence to be prevalent against transgender and gender non-conforming students
rates of attempted suicide are nearly 10 times higher for this *group* of young *people*
