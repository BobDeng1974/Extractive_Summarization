by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 22 november 2013 @entity2 : 13:12 est , 22 november 2013 a four - year - old girl has taken her first proper steps thanks to the generosity of @entity7 ’s biggest lottery winners			2
@entity8 and @entity9 dipped into their £ 161million @entity11 jackpot to pay for @entity12 , who has cerebral palsy , to have revolutionary spinal surgery			1
she has now undergone the complex operation and taken her first tentative steps with the aid of walking sticks			2
@entity12 , four , has taken her first steps after lottery winners @entity9 and @entity22 paid for her to have pioneering cerebral palsy surgery her mother , @entity24 , 39 , hopes she will soon walk unaided and go on to live a normal life			1
mr and mrs @entity27 paid the £ 28,000 needed for the @entity29 operation after ms @entity12 wrote them a letter asking for help when her local @entity34 trust refused funding			1
she was stunned to receive a phone call informing her that the kind couple – who are @entity7 ’s biggest single jackpot winners - would stump up the cash			1
ms @entity12 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , said : ‘ the operation was a success and so far she ’s making good progress			1
‘ she is already walking better , which is fantastic , and where her muscles were tight before , it has taken that away			0
‘ she had to lie flat for 48 hours after the operation , but now she is moving well and can already notice the difference			0
mr and mrs @entity27 won an £ 161 million @entity11 jackpot in 2011 making them @entity7 's biggest jackpot winners			1
they donated the money for @entity12 's operation after her mother wrote to them asking for help @entity12 ( pictured with her parents , @entity24 and @entity61 ) was dependent upon a wheelchair before she had the operation but she is now taking her first tentative steps ‘ in the past she could n’t move her toes very easily whereas now she can			1
we ’re really pleased with how it went , and of course extremely grateful to everyone who made it possible			0
’ @entity12 was born 13 weeks premature weighing just 1lb 15oz and suffers from spastic diplegic cerebral palsy , which has largely confined her to a wheelchair			1
she was unsteady on her feet , unable to walk any distance without tiring and dreamed of walking and running like other children			2
her family and friends managed to raise £ 12,000 for surgery to allow her to walk normally but were still a long way from the £ 40,000 needed			1
so , ms @entity12 wrote to @entity26 and mrs @entity27 , of @entity82 in @entity83 , and asked them to donate the rest of the cash			1
ms @entity12 said : ' the operation was a success and so far she 's making good progress			2
she is already walking better , which is fantastic , and where her muscles were tight before , it has taken that away ' the operation at @entity95 , in @entity93 , took four hours to complete			0
although the procedure has been carried out in the @entity98 for many years , it is new to the @entity7			0
without the operation - which involves partially cutting the nerve roots where they join the spinal cord to loosen the muscles - she would have needed major corrective surgery in a few years and faced spending lots of her time in her wheelchair			1
ms @entity12 , a full - time carer for @entity107 , said she could already see the difference in her little girl			1
‘ the way she moved before put a lot of strain on joints and muscles which would have led to long - term problems , ’ she said			2
‘ now she is walking properly with the help of a tripod and she is getting stronger all the time			0
in a statement @entity26 and mrs @entity27 said they hoped their donation would allow the @entity12 family to concentrate on @entity12 's welfare ‘ we hope within a couple of months she will be able to walk unaided			1
‘ certainly in the long term the operation will have a big impact on improving her quality of life			0
‘ @entity107 is in very positive spirits too which is wonderful to see			0
’ in a statement @entity26 and mrs @entity27 - who scooped their jackpot in july 2011 – said they hoped their donation would allow the @entity12 family to concentrate on @entity12 ’s welfare			1
they said : ‘ @entity12 faces many challenges in the next year and she needs her mum and dad to be focused on her			2
‘ that ’s why we ’ve given a donation			0
without the additional worry and pressure of fundraising , their time can be spent on @entity107			0
’ @entity29 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			0
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			2
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			0
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs .			2

@entity8 and @entity9 gave £ 28,000 of their £ 161m @entity11 jackpot to pay for @entity12 to have the surgery she needed to walk
@entity12 was born 13 weeks premature and has spastic diplegic cerebral palsy
before the surgery she was dependent on a wheelchair but she can now walk with the help of sticks - her parents hope she will soon walk unaided
