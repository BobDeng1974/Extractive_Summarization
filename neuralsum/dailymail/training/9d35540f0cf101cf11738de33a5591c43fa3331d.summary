@entity1 supporters led by secretive oil billionaires the @entity4 brothers have pledged to oust @entity5 from power - by stumping up a $ 100million war - chest			1
@entity8 and @entity4 , worth a combined $ 50billion , have been joined by 300 of @entity10 's wealthiest businessmen in promising the cash to stop @entity5 from being re-elected			1
they met at the conservative brothers ' annual three - day @entity14 retreat , where they gain pledges for non-profit groups that share their libertarian world view			0
brotherly ambition : @entity8 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) are rallying @entity10 's most powerful businesspeople to donate $ 100million to oust @entity5 from the @entity21 but it is believed this is the first time the get - together has zoomed in one sole issue			1
sources said an ' alpha - male ' mentality of beating @entity5 at this year 's election at all costs soon took over amongst the visitors			1
@entity4 , 76 , will put up $ 40million from his personal fortune , while @entity8 , 71 , has pledged $ 20million to the battle			1
as individuals can only donate $ 2,500 to a candidate , the $ 100million will almost certainly go to one of the independent @entity1 political action committees			2
competition : democrat @entity5 ( left ) will most likely be challenged by @entity38 ( right ) in the 2012 after the @entity1 won the last two primaries while they are supposed to be neutral , the committees usually ally themselves to a particular candidate and then use the money to support them			2
the brothers ' @entity43 has already spent $ 6.8million on adverts attacking the president			2
@entity5 's campaign is returning $ 200,000 in contributions collected by the family members of a @entity51 casino owner who fled the @entity10 after facing drug and fraud charges			1
@entity5 's team said it would return donations arranged by @entity58 brothers @entity56 and @entity57 of casino owner @entity59			1
he skipped bail in @entity61 in 1994 and has since been linked to violence and corruption in @entity51			0
campaign officials also said they would also return around $ 100,000 donated by other people connected to @entity59			0
spokesman @entity66 said : ' on the basis of the questions that have been raised , we will return the contributions from these individuals and from any other donors they brought to the campaign			0
' the pair have trodden a notoriously secretive path in amassing their wealth			0
but they started to gain more prominence when they helped launch the @entity82 movement			2
they are ranked at numbers 18 and 19 on the @entity86 100 @entity85 , and have given more than $ 100million to right - wing causes			0
a total of $ 55million of that has gone in trying to discredit the science behind man - made climate change			0
the brothers are co-owners of energy giant @entity93 , the firm founded by their father @entity95 in 1940 , and have since expanded the business to 2,600 times its inherited size			0
initially involved in oil refining , the company is now one of the biggest firm in the country , producing well - known brands such as @entity105 carpet , @entity107 fiber , @entity109 tissue and @entity111 paper			0
they have two other brothers , 78 - year - old @entity95 and 71 - year - old @entity114 , who were all involved in litigation against each other in the 1980s and 1990s			0
@entity5 raised $ 224.6million in 2011 , more than the total gathered by all four of his @entity1 challengers			1
but sources said @entity121 casino billionaire @entity120 , who has so far bankrolled @entity122 for $ 10million , attended the event at the at the plush @entity125 resort , in @entity14 's @entity126 , for the first time			1
and a group set up by @entity130 's former special adviser @entity129 has also set a fundraising target of $ 200million for the election .			2
