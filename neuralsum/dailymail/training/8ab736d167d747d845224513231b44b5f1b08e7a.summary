by @entity0 a rising number of childless couples who are struggling to conceive naturally are launching crowdfunding campaigns in hopes of raising money for expensive fertility treatments ; from family , friends , and strangers alike			1
@entity10 , a 40 - year - old marketing director , and her 34 - year - old husband @entity12 , who live in @entity13 , have been struggling with infertility for two years and are aiming to drum up $ 32,000 from their @entity16 campaign , to pay for a ' last hope ' @entity19 session in hopes of achieving their baby dream			1
' any donation level is welcome ... even if you only have $ 5 to donate we will be thrilled ! ' the couple write on their page , which has so far raised $ 3,664			1
' if you do have the financial freedom , please consider a donation of $ 100 - if we can get 300 people to give this amount we will be able to have our child ! ' appeal : @entity10 , a 40 - year - old marketing director ( right ) and her 34 - year - old husband @entity12 ( left ) , have been struggling with infertility for two years and need donations for a ' last hope ' @entity19 session ' @entity12 took a lot of persuading , because he did n’t like the idea of airing our laundry in public , ' mrs @entity10 tells @entity45 at the @entity46 of their decision to launch the campaign			1
' but now he ’s amazed at the kindness and generosity that people have shown			0
' mrs @entity10 , who has already undergone several rounds of failed ivf and burned through their $ 42,000 savings , has found a @entity57 clinic which promises that if after six attempts , they do n't come home with a healthy baby , they will have their costs refunded			2
it is unclear exactly why @entity19 has been unsuccessful so far in this particular case , but mrs @entity10 writes : ' what happens naturally for millions of couples every year was unlikely to happen naturally for us			0
' hopeful : @entity70 and @entity71 ( pictured ) are appealing for $ 5,000 to help with surrogacy costs , and hope to have twins			2
as an incentive , they are offering ' two free hours with the babies ' for donations of $ 100 unusual as this last - ditch effort might sound , it 's becoming an increasingly popular strategy for cash - strapped and desperate couples eager to start families			1
@entity16 claims that over $ 1.1million in funding has been raised worldwide for its ' babies , kids and @entity88 ' category since its 2010 launch			1
and donations in the last six months alone were a third higher than those raised in the entirety of 2013			2
in @entity93 is the process of fertilization by manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish			0
when the @entity19 procedure is successful , the process is combined with a procedure known as embryo transfer , which involves physically placing the embryo in the uterus			0
@entity19 costs an average of $ 12,400 per session in the @entity107 , and its success rate varies significantly according to a range of factors , especially age			2
for women under 35 , the success rate is 30 to 35per cent , and for women over 40 , it 's between six and 10per cent			0
according to @entity117 and mrs @entity10 , responses to their campaign have been largely positive , but for a few suggestions that the couple should ' just adopt ' instead , which mrs @entity10 admits ' stung a little			0
' she points out that adoption is n't necessarily easier or even less costly than @entity19			0
if they fail to raise the remaining $ 27,000 within a month , the couple have the opportunity to take out a loan with the clinic			2
@entity127 , president of the @entity128 , is an activist who stands against certain fertility interventions and recently produced @entity130 ; a documentary which questions the ethics of surrogacy			1
' it ’s pretty cynical and presumptuous to ask friends , family and strangers for money for crazy expensive @entity19 , ' she tells the @entity46			2
' it ’s tacky and tasteless			1
what are they going to ask for next ? the child ’s private school or college fund ? ' the whole thing operates at the @entity147 sentiment			0
it ’s a case of , " we want it , so give it to us now			0
" ' fingers crossed : @entity151 ( pictured with her husband ) has never ovulated , and needs $ 2,000 for ' tests , surgery , medication , and doctors ' a quick search on @entity16 , however , reveals plenty of other childless couples who are going the same route			1
@entity70 and @entity71 , a newly married gay couple based in @entity161 , @entity13 , are appealing for $ 5,000 to help with their surrogacy costs , and hope to have twins			2
as an incentive , they are offering ' a photo with the babies ' to those who donate $ 50 , and for $ 100 , donors can have ' two free hours with the babies			1
' they have so far raised $ 145			1
' it ’s tacky and tasteless			1
what are they going to ask for next ? the child ’s private school or college fund ? ' @entity151 and her husband , from @entity180 , @entity181 , have struggled both with their fertility issues , and with their efforts to raise much money on @entity16			1
' i have several cysts on my ovaries and my lh levels were extremely high ... basically i have never ovulated , ' she writes on her page , which has raised $ 135 in nine months			1
' tests , surgery , medication , and doctors , we will see ! ' needs must : @entity197 ( left ) and @entity198 ( right ) are n't covered by their insurance			0
' we must pay for all medications , ultrasounds , procedures , and blood work out of pocket ' they claim , and have so far raised $ 789 towards their $ 15,000 goal @entity197 and @entity198 , from @entity208 , @entity209 , have been trying to conceive for almost nine years			1
' i have @entity211 and @entity212 , ' writes mrs @entity213			0
' my insurance excludes all fertility treatment in any form of coverage			0
we must pay for all medications , ultrasounds , procedures , and blood work out of pocket			0
' they have so far raised $ 789 towards their $ 15,000 goal			1
according to the latest report from the @entity225 , more women are turning to @entity19 than ever before , with over 165,172 procedures performed in the last recorded year , 2012 , and 61,740 babies born as a result			2
the success rate for women under the age of 35 using their own eggs was about 40per cent			0
for women between ages 35 and 37 , it dropped to 31per cent , and for 42 - year - olds , the rate was only 3.9per cent			0
' we must pay for all medications , ultrasounds , procedures , and blood work out of pocket ' and contrary to the huge spike in women turning to @entity19 in hopes of conceiving - a process which costs an average of $ 12,400 for one round - natural births have been declining dramatically in @entity107 since 2007 , according to data from the @entity253			0
it remains to be seen whether fertility - challenged couples will win success from the hearts of the public in the form of hefty donations , but regardless , the enterprising trend looks like it 's here to stay .			0
