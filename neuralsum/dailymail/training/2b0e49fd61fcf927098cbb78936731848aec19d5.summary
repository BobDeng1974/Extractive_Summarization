by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 8 march 2013 for a man of 72 who ’s survived 55 years in showbusiness – albeit without a great deal of over-indulgence – sir @entity5 does a pretty good job of looking half his age			1
and here he is doing it all over again as he waits at @entity10 in jeans and a check shirt , cuffs fashionably folded back just the once			1
so perhaps the singer can be forgiven for the odd inconsistency in the battle to hold back time			2
checking in : sit @entity5 at @entity16 looking youthful , left , and last year with his auburn look , right his hair was a great deal darker than it was a few months ago – changing from auburn to its current shade of deep brown			1
the singer admits he has his hair coloured , saying : ‘ i said to my hairdresser , “ every time i lift my hair up i can see grey			1
will you colour it for me ? ” it does n’t show up in photos , so it ’s just for my own vanity			2
’ he has put his youthful looks down to a strict diet and exercise , as well as avoiding drink and drugs			0
sir @entity5 might like to share some of his beauty secrets with an ex tv co-star			0
@entity44 , 62 , who guested several times on his show it ’s @entity5 in the 1970s , looks to have resorted to @entity47 to defy the years , leaving her face wrinkle - free but rather bloated as she appears on tonight ’s @entity50 show to promote her first @entity52 tour for decades			0
smoothie : @entity44 on @entity56 's @entity55 show , left , and in 1985 , right sir @entity5 might like to share some of his beauty secrets with his ex tv co-star @entity44			0
