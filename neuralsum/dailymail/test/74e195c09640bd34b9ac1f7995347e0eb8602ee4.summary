an innocent man who spent more than 30 years on death row for a murder he did n't commit has come face - to - face with the prosecutor who put him there			1
@entity6 , who was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer after his release last year , was too weak to stand when @entity9 walked into his @entity11 home last week but shook his hand			1
' i want you to know that i am very sorry , ' @entity9 said during the somber meeting , which was filmed by @entity16			1
' it 's a stain on me that will be with me until i go to my grave			0
' ' right , ' @entity6 responded , without looking up			1
' but it still cost me 31 years of my life and then nothing at the end but death because they give me from six to eight months to live			2
@entity6 was released from prison in @entity31 last year face - to - face : the 65 - year - old , who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer shortly after being freed from prison , shook the former prosecutor 's hand as he walked into his home ' i 'm sorry , ' @entity6 added			1
' i ca n't forgive you			0
' @entity9 , who wished @entity6 the best before leaving the home , had asked to meet the man after apologizing to him in a powerful letter published in the @entity43 last month			1
in the letter , @entity9 admitted that he was to blame for mistakenly putting @entity45 behind bars for the fatal shooting of a jeweler , despite no murder weapon or witnesses placing him at the scene			1
' in 1984 , i was 33 years old , ' he wrote			0
' i was arrogant , judgmental , narcissistic and very full of myself			0
i was not as interested in justice as i was in winning			1
' @entity9 , 63 , wrote the letter after the state ruled that @entity45 was not entitled to receive $ 330,000 in compensation for his time spent behind bars because he could not prove he did not know about the killing before it was carried out			1
' @entity6 should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life , ' @entity9 wrote			1
struggle : @entity6 told @entity9 that he could not forgive him for what he had done as a young lawyer pain : after @entity9 left , @entity6 was overcome with emotion and was comforted by his carers , pictured ' the audacity of the state 's effort to deny mr. @entity6 any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of @entity11 justice is appalling			1
' @entity6 was accused of shooting @entity78 , a @entity80 jeweler and watchmaker for whom mr @entity6 had done occasional yard work , in 1983 and was convicted the following year			1
he was sent to prison , where he lived with little light or heat , while @entity9 , who had been with the @entity88 's office for two years , went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team			1
' that 's sick , ' he said in his letter			2
' i had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being , a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any " celebration "			0
' from behind bars , @entity45 continued to protest his innocence			0
then in 2013 , state district judge @entity102 voided the conviction and sentence based on an informant claiming that another man , @entity106 , had confessed to killing @entity78			0
regrets : @entity109 ' @entity108 , pictured , wrote a lengthy apology letter to @entity45 last month that was published in a local newspaper			1
in the letter , he also slammed the state for refusing to pay the man compensation @entity106 , along with his brother @entity115 , had been eyed by investigators in relation to the killing but have never been charged in @entity78 's death			2
they have since been indicted in other murders			0
wrongly accused : @entity6 , a father - of - four ( pictured in a booking photo ) , was sent to death row in 1984 ' my fault was that i was too passive , ' @entity9 said in his letter last month			1
' had i been more inquisitive , perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago ... ' i did not hide evidence , i simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion			2
and that omission is on me			0
' he added that the odds were stacked against @entity45 , whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law			0
@entity6 , who is black , also faced an all - white jury			1
' i apologize to @entity6 for all the misery i have caused him and his family , ' @entity9 wrote			1
' i apologize to the family of mr. @entity78 for giving them the false hope of some closure			0
' @entity6 walked free from @entity31 in @entity31 on march 11 , 2014 , wearing a jean jacket , sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes			2
as he walked out of the prison gates , he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now - adult sons , but added : ' it feels good ; my mind is going in all kind of directions			0
' prison officials gave the then - 64 - year - old a debit card worth just $ 20			2
that , along with the money that he had in his bank account , left mr @entity6 with a paltry $ 20.24 to his name			2
freed : @entity45 is pictured in march 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars			2
he was given just $ 20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay making the days count : @entity45 , pictured earlier this year , relies on @entity171 disability and food stamps			0
he is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer , which is now terminal his lawyers set up an @entity179 wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so @entity45 could start to re-build his life , and he continues to accept donations			1
with the help of a non-profit group , @entity188 , he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment			0
he relies on @entity171 disability and food stamps , while volunteers help to take care of him			0
he has also visited @entity195 to see his four sons			0
after he left prison , he learned he had @entity199 lung cancer , which has now progressed to @entity200			0
ahead of the meeting with @entity9 , he told @entity16 he was shocked by @entity9 's letter , but that he refused to get angry over his situation			1
' i 'm upset , yes , but it 's not my driving force , ' he said , too weak to even open his eyes			0
' [ my driving force ] is to get well as i possibly can			0
i ca n't do that being mad at @entity9			2
' see below for video			0

@entity9 admitted in a letter published in a @entity11 newspaper last month that he was to blame for putting @entity6 behind bars in 1983

@entity9 visited @entity6 's home to apologize to him face - to - face but @entity6 told him he was not able to forgive him
