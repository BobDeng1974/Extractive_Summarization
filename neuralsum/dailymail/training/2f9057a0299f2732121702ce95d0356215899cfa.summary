the writer and socialite was seen laden down with bags from the upmarket supermarket chain , who she joined as a columnist in march , as she shopped in @entity16			2
no doubt the tennis fan was stocking up on strawberries and cream in advance of the @entity22 championship , which begins today			0
writer and socialite @entity5 was seen laden down with @entity2 bags in @entity16 on sunday and strawberries and cream seemed to be the inspiration behind her wacky wardrobe choice			2
the 29 - year - old wore a coral cashmere dress and cardigan combination by @entity16 label @entity32 by @entity34			1
although the twinset was unfortunately ageing on sporty young @entity5 as she made a dash to the supermarket the £ 265 @entity39 bodycon dress is described by the company as exuding ' true feminine elegancy ... perfect for a dressed - up dinner			1
' the online description continues : ' this simple and elegant short sleeved dress , binds into the waist with a combination of cashmere and silk to enhance on the figure for that perfect looking body			0
' the matching £ 235 cardigan is described as the perfect ' cute cardigan for @entity54			1
' @entity55 of @entity57 's younger sister often raises eyebrows with her rather dowdy styling and the unflattering woolen dress seemed a strange choice for a trip to the shops , especially when teamed with a pair of canvas pumps			0

residents of the village thronged onto the streets to watch guests - including @entity90 and @entity91 - make their way from the castle to the parish church for the wedding and @entity5 , dressed in a stylish monochrome dress was greeted at the church gates by cries from the crowd of ' beautiful '			0
later she joined 500 guests to celebrate after the service at the bride 's 1000 - year - old ancestral home which has doubled for @entity105 in the @entity107 films			0
@entity5 smiles as she arrives for the wedding of @entity83 and @entity109 , daughter of @entity111 and @entity110 , the @entity112 and @entity55 of @entity85 @entity5 attended the high profile wedding without her stockbroker boyfriend @entity114 , 35 , but it seems that their romance has stepped up a gear in recent weeks and love must have been on her mind when she wrote her latest recipe instalment for @entity2 magazine – a ‘ romantic picnic for two ’			2
@entity125 's socialite sister extolled the benefits of ‘ whisk [ ing ] away someone special for an evening of gazing and grazing ’ and the @entity144 menu includes peach and vanilla fizz , a fig and goat ’s cheese fougasse – a type of bread associated with @entity136 – smoked chicken and melon salad and strawberry and lavender cheesecake jars			0
