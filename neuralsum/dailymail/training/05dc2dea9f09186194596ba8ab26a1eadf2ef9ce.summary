the @entity1 ’s @entity0 , who used to hire and fire @entity4 managers , are now marginalised to such an extent that they do n’t even stay in the same hotel as the team on away trips			1
much to the upset of the blazers who travelled to @entity12 for tuesday ’s friendly , the @entity1 booked them into the @entity15 hotel in @entity16 , while manager @entity17 and his backroom staff , plus the players , had rooms at the @entity21 some distance away			1
the blazers want and expect the new separate - hotel policy to be short - lived , but it looks likely to outlast the increasingly irrelevant @entity0			2
the two - hotel idea stemmed from a @entity27 presentation given by performance chief @entity28 who , together with technical director designate @entity29 , seemingly calls most of the shots on @entity4 matters off the field			0
@entity4 manager @entity17 felt that there were too many people mingling with his team on matchdays @entity28 told the @entity1 board that he believed the 80 - strong @entity40 entourage was far too big and @entity17 felt there were too many people mingling with his players in the hotel at meal - times and on match days — leading to the changes			1
meanwhile , @entity49 head of football operations @entity48 has replaced @entity52 chief @entity51 on the dysfunctional @entity0			2
@entity53 has never been seen anywhere near a senior @entity4 match , raising the question why a busy football club executive such as her was ever put on a glad - handing committee in the first place			0
former @entity1 chairman @entity62 ’s suggestion that @entity4 should boycott the 2018 @entity40 in @entity63 , in protest at @entity66 ’s running of the game , has understandably being given short shrift at @entity69			1
the fa inside view is that @entity62 would never have recommended such drastic action while in office , where he was very much a consensus - led figure			2
former @entity1 chief @entity62 called for @entity4 to boycott the 2018 @entity40 in @entity63 @entity75 ’s rampant commercialism saw the @entity78 sponsors ’ logo behind the posts painted on the grass just half a metre from the try line , causing confusion to referee @entity83 in the @entity4 v @entity84 match			1
it has now been moved back all of another half - metre			0
meanwhile , a £ 1 deposit on beer glasses has led to kids rummaging in rubbish bins around the concourse in the hope of making a quick buck , but the eco-friendly @entity95 counter that there has been a 40 per cent drop in wastage			0
@entity78 logos painted in the end zone at @entity75 for @entity102 internationals caused confusion for officials the final casualty of @entity4 ’s @entity40 debacle in @entity107 looks to be an executive with team sponsors @entity109 , who were part of the top - heavy travelling circus			2
@entity112 was given his marching orders by the popular @entity1 partners			0
@entity95 losing @entity116 battle even the intervention of @entity95 chief executive @entity118 does n’t look like preventing @entity119 from downgrading the autumn international series , despite radio offering the only live coverage of games on the @entity116			0
such is the power of football that @entity4 v @entity126 — the struggling home team ’s last test against a southern - hemisphere side before the @entity40 — is due to be relegated to 5 @entity130 because it clashes with run - of - the - mill @entity132 matches			1
@entity118 was asked to help by rugby factions within the @entity116 , concerned at the way such a showcase occasion was being treated			0
a @entity119 spokeswoman said rugby would receive more airtime on @entity130 but a final scheduling decision would be made next week			0
the @entity141 investigation into the @entity132 ’s selling of football rights is not expected to affect the tender for the next three - year deal starting in the first quarter of 2015			1
but the @entity141 probe is confusing to say the least — acting on @entity151 ’s complaint that the current 41 per cent of matches sold to tv leads to higher subscription costs , while also looking to preserve the 3pm saturday kick - off fixtures from where extra tv matches would have to be drawn			0
@entity141 's investigation into the sale of @entity132 rights is not expected to affect the next tender in 2015			1

@entity0 stay in different hotel from team on away days
@entity17 felt there were too many people mingling with his players
@entity62 's call to boycott @entity40 given short shrift at @entity69
