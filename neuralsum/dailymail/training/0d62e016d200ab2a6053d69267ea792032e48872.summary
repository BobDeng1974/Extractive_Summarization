conflict : @entity1 , 70 , has been branded an antisemitic after his comments last week the former frontman of @entity5 has sparked outrage after comparing @entity8 's government to the @entity10 regime			1
leading rabbis and @entity13 writers have blasted @entity1 as antisemitic for claiming the state 's treatment of @entity17 is akin to the oppression of @entity13 between 1933 and 1946			1
@entity1 , 70 , who refuses to visit or perform in @entity8 , said he would not have played in @entity19 or @entity20 during the @entity21 either			1
' the parallels with what went on in the 1930s in @entity20 are so crushingly obvious , ' he told @entity27 magazine @entity25 last week			0
' there were many people that pretended that the oppression of the @entity13 was not going on			1
so this is not a new scenario			0
except that this time , it 's the @entity17 people being murdered			1
' he claimed @entity17 are regarded as ' sub-human ' , and branded the @entity8 rabbinate ' bizarre '			1
enraged , rabbi @entity39 has hit back at @entity1 , calling his comments an ' antisemitic diatribe ' which outstretches any other attack on @entity8 and @entity13			1
writing in the @entity44 , rabbi @entity39 said : ' mr @entity1 , the @entity45 were a genocidal regime that murdered six million @entity13			2
' that you would have the audacity to compare @entity13 to monsters who murdered them shows you have no decency , you have no heart , you have no soul			2
' the conflict comes just months after @entity1 was forced to explain why he used a pig - shaped balloon decorated with a @entity56 on the set of one of his concerts , seen by many to single out @entity61 as an evil force			0
the singer , a vocal supporter of the @entity17 cause , rebuffed his critics by claiming it was one of many religious symbols on the stage			2
last night , @entity1 rejected his critics once again			0
it follows outrage earlier this year when a pig balloon marked with a @entity56 formed part of @entity1 ' set at a concert			0
@entity1 rejected claims it was a message to fans that @entity61 is a force of evil speaking in @entity80 , he said : ‘ i do not know rabbi @entity39 , and am not prepared to get into a slanging match with him			0
i will say this : i have nothing against @entity13 or @entity8 , and i am not antisemitic			1
‘ i deplore the policies of the @entity8 government in the occupied territories and @entity88			1
they are immoral , inhuman and illegal			0
i will continue my non-violent protests as long as the government of @entity8 continues with these policies			2
’ @entity92 , chief executive of the @entity93 , said everyone was ‘ entitled to an opinion and to advocate passionately for a cause ’			0
but she added : ‘ drawing inappropriate parallels with the @entity98 insults the memory of the six million @entity13 – men , women and children – murdered by the @entity45			0
' these kinds of attacks are commonly used as veiled antisemitism and should be exposed as such			0

*bassist* , 70 , said treatment of @entity17 is same as the oppression of @entity13 during @entity21 adding that they are treated as ' sub-human '
refuses to play in @entity8 as he ' would *n't* play in occupied @entity19 either '
