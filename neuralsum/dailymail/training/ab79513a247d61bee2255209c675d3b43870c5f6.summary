@entity1 @entity0 have passed legislation to shut down a program by president @entity4 granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as kids , with many calling the bill a dead - end as the @entity9 leaves for summer break			1
the legislation that passed 216 - 192 late friday could put more than 700,000 immigrants who 've received temporary work permits in line for deportation			1
it also would block @entity4 from awarding work permits to other immigrants here illegally			1
@entity1 @entity0 have passed legislation to shut down a program by president @entity4 granting deportation relief to immigrants brought here illegally as kids the bill was supported by conservatives who demanded it as their price for backing a separate measure dealing with the crisis of unaccompanied minors flooding the border			1
the @entity9 has already adjourned for @entity32 ' summer recess so neither bill stands a chance of becoming law			1
as @entity37 notes , president @entity4 and @entity9 @entity36 have said they wo n't even consider said legislation			1
@entity4 called the move political theater ' just so they can check a box before they 're leaving town for a month			1
a day after @entity0 leaders pulled the border bill from the floor in a chaotic retreat , tea party lawmakers were enthusiastically on board with the new $ 694 million version and a companion measure that would shut off a program created by @entity4 granting work permits to immigrants brought here illegally as kids			1
the second bill also seemed designed to prevent the more than 700,000 people who 've already gotten work permits under the program from renewing them , ultimately making them subject to deportation			1
the spending bill passed 223 - 189 late friday , with only four @entity0 voting " no " and one @entity62 voting ' yes			1
' a vote on the second measure was expected later in the night			0
' it 's dealing with the issue that the @entity68 people care about more than any other , and that is stopping the invasion of illegal foreign nationals into our country , ' said rep. @entity74 , @entity75 ' and we got to yes			0
' but @entity4 said no. ' they 're not even trying to solve the problem , ' the president said			1
' i 'm going to have to act alone , because we do not have enough resources			0
' @entity4 said he would reallocate resources where he could , while making clear his options were limited without congressional action			2
the moves in the @entity1 came on what was to have been the first day of lawmakers ' five - week summer recess , delayed by @entity0 leaders after their vote plans unexpectedly collapsed on thursday			2
senators had already left @entity91 after killing their own legislation on the border crisis , so there was no prospect of reaching a final deal			2
rep. @entity97 of @entity98 , a leading immigration hardliner , said he was ' very satisfied ' with the results but three months before midterm elections , @entity1 @entity0 were determined to show that they , at least , could take action to address the crisis involving tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors fleeing violence and poverty in @entity106 to cross illegally into @entity107			2
' it would be irresponsible and unstatesmanlike to head home for the month without passing a bill to address this serious , present crisis on the border , ' said rep. @entity113 , @entity114 , chairman of the @entity115			0
to reach a deal , @entity0 leaders had to satisfy the demands of a group of a dozen or more conservative lawmakers who were meeting behind the scenes with sens. @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity123 , @entity124 , and taking their cues from outside groups such as the @entity127 that opposed earlier versions of the legislation			0
these lawmakers objected to sending any more money to @entity4 without a strong stance against his two - year - old deportation relief program , which @entity0 blame for causing the current border crisis by creating the perception that once here , young migrants would be allowed to stay - a point the administration disputes			1
@entity1 @entity0 leaders agreed earlier in the week to hold a separate vote to prevent @entity4 from expanding the deportation relief program , but that did n't satisfy conservatives who held out for stronger steps			1
thursday night , those lawmakers huddled in the basement of the @entity146 with new @entity1 majority whip @entity147 , @entity148 , until coming up with a deal ending funding for the deportation relief program as well as making changes to the border bill aimed at ensuring the faster removal of the @entity106 migrant youths			2
friday morning , as the full @entity0 caucus met in the @entity146 , conservative lawmakers were declaring victory			0
' i 'm very satisfied , ' said rep. @entity158 , @entity98 , the leading immigration hardliner in the @entity1			0
in the end @entity0 only lost four of the most conservative members on the vote : reps			0
@entity163 of @entity164 , @entity165 of @entity166 , @entity167 of @entity168 and @entity169 of @entity170			0
rep. @entity74 called ' stopping the invasion of illegal foreign nationals ' the issue @entity68 care about most the only @entity62 to support the bill was moderate rep. @entity175 of @entity107			2
the @entity0 plans met with howls of protest from immigration advocates and @entity180 , who warned @entity0 that they 'd be alienating @entity183 voters for years to come			0
' if you tell people that you think they 're criminals , that you think they 're simply bringing diseases , that they 're bringing drugs , then you treat them as invaders , they kind of think you do n't like them , ' said rep. @entity190 , @entity191 ' they 're going to believe you do n't like them , and they 're not going to vote for you			0
' the new @entity0 border bill adds $ 35 million more for the @entity193 , which would go to reimburse states for guard deployments			0
like earlier versions , it would increase spending for overwhelmed border agencies , add more immigration judges and detention spaces , and alter a 2008 anti-trafficking law to permit @entity106 kids to be sent back home without deportation hearings			2
that process is currently permitted only for unaccompanied minors arriving from @entity208 and @entity209			0
the bill would pay for strapped border agencies only for the final two months of this budget year , falling far short of the $ 3.7 billion @entity4 initially requested to deal with the crisis into next year			1
more than 57,000 unaccompanied youths have arrived since october , mostly from @entity215 , @entity216 , and @entity217 , plus tens of thousands more migrants traveling as families .			0

legislation passed shortly before recess called ' for show ' by president @entity4
with both the president and @entity9 *democrats* set against it , bill has little chance of becoming law
legislation that passed 216 - 192 late friday could put more than 700,000 immigrants who 've received temporary work permits in line for deportation
