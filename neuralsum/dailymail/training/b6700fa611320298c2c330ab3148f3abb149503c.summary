by @entity0 , @entity1 a black box inside your car will tell insurers when you 've crashed and also alert the emergency services all new cars are to be fitted with a ‘ black box ’ that could tell your insurer the moment you are involved in a crash			1
the devices will also alert the emergency services to the accident – but data protection campaigners fear it could lead to ‘ @entity20 surveillance ’ of millions of motorists			1
they fear drivers will have their habits and destinations recorded and potentially sold on for commercial gain			0
insurance firms already offer cut - price cover for drivers willing to have their every move recorded on a memory card under the dashboard to prove they are safe drivers			0
but @entity35 legislation will make it compulsory for every new car to have an electronic ‘ sos ’ black box system linked to satellite tracking that will alert the authorities to a crash			1
some systems can tell how many people are in the car thanks to sensors in the seats , or even allow the police to slow a car down remotely if it is stolen			0
web - based @entity49 , which has 350,000 drivers who already use black boxes , said : ‘ the data is used to assess driving safety , as well as to assist claims handling			2
‘ our service centre receives an alert whenever the data suggests a car may have been involved in an accident			1
' the box also works as a tracking device , so we can help police to locate the car in the event of a theft			2
’ @entity67 said data collected from its customers was never sold on to third parties			0
insurance firms already offer cut - price cover for drivers willing to have their every move recorded on a memory card ( file picture ) @entity77 is to install similar technology into all of its new cars from next year			0
but @entity81 of @entity20 said : ‘ there is a risk that drivers will lose control over who has access to their data and how they will use it			1
it is easy to imagine government departments and commercial companies , including the insurance industry , will be clamouring to get hold of drivers ’ information			0

new cars will be fitted with the black box device to tell insurers of a crash
box will also alert the emergency services to the accident
but data protection campaigners fear it could lead to @entity20 style surveillance
