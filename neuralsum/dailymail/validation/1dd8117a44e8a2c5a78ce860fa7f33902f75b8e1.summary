high social status has its privileges - even in wild animals			1
researchers studying spotted hyenas in @entity5 found that high - ranking members of a clan live longer , are healthier and even have more offspring			1
the discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres - caps at the end of each strand of @entity14 - regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species , including humans			1
researchers studied the status and health of spotted hyenas in @entity5 ( stock image )			1
they found high - ranking members of groups live longer and are healthier and these alpha females were also found to have more offspring			1
the discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres @entity31 from @entity33 's zoology department said : ' if you want to see the hierarchy of spotted hyenas , throw down some fresh meat near them			1
' it 's quickly apparent who 's dominant and who 's not			0
' but she wanted to know if these long - accepted biological markers would support what she was seeing in the field			0
ms @entity31 worked with fellow lead author and @entity33 zoologist @entity46 to study more than 25 years of data on hyenas across the @entity50 country			0
telomeres are caps at the end of each strand of @entity14 that protect chromosomes from deterioration			1
these biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species , including humans			1
shrinking telomeres are a signal that cells are sliding into ' defensive mode ' , stressful actions that could soon lead to cells ' - and to the person or animal 's - death			2
high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers			1
in young humans , telomeres are about 8,000 - 10,000 nucleotides long			2
they shorten with each cell division , however , and when they reach a critical length the cell stops dividing or dies			0
this internal ' clock ' makes it difficult to keep most cells growing in a laboratory for more than a few cell doublings			0
she also spent a summer in @entity5 observing hyenas ' social structure			2
the team of researchers focused on telomeres , caps that protect chromosomes from deterioration			2

high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers suggesting they were healthier			1
group membership significantly predicted telomere length of those female hyenas that sat at the top of the social hierarchy			0
but ms @entity31 also noted a couple of interesting twists			0
the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres			1
however , the length was relative to each individual clan			0
this meant that if researchers found a lone hyena wandering the savanna they could n't simply identify it as an alpha female based solely on telomere length			2
also the team was able to rule other factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food - which could be linked to better overall health			0

high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers and clan membership predicted telomere length of those that sat at the top of the hierarchy although the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres , the length was relative to each individual clan so telomeres could n't be used to identify leaders when on their own			1
the team was able to rule out factors that could possibly influence telomere length such as abundance of food its research found no correlation between the amount of food and the size of the biological marker			0
' this work shows , for the first time , the effects of social rank on telomere length in wild mammals , ' ms @entity31 said			0
' this enhances our understanding of how social and ecological variables may contribute to age - related declines of hyenas , and in organisms in general			0
' ' the fact that there is variation in telomere length when prey abundance is constant means that there are other factors we need to find			0
' we think it 's less about genetics and more influenced by the environment , but we just need to keep searching for the right environmental factors			0
' the results are published in the journal of @entity202 .			0
