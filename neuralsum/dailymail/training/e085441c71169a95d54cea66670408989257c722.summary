by @entity0 if you regularly reach for a hangover cure , just be thankful you do n't live in @entity3			0
instead of a traditional fry up , you 'd be reaching for a glass of tomato juice and pickled sheep eyeballs			1
that 's according to graphic design agency @entity9 in @entity11 , which has created a set of infographics describing the strangest hangover cures from around the world			2
the least offensive is the @entity18 eggs , sausages and bacon , which according to the graphic helps the liver replenish lost electrolytes because of its high protein , fat and salt content			2
ditch the fry up ? : in @entity3 the traditional recipe for a hangover is eyeballs in tomato juice @entity32 : the inforgraphic warns that bird droppings may do more harm than good the efficacy of some other countries ' traditional cures are slightly more dubious - including @entity32 's traditional cure of sparrow droppings in brandy			2
the caption on the infographic points out that bird poo can introduce parasites to the body can cause disease			0
so perhaps best to give that one a miss. the @entity49 recipe of sheep 's lungs and owl eggs sounds equally unappealing but apparently has some underlying benefits			1
these cheap sources of protein may have worked wonders for @entity57 and his cronies as the amino acid 's in the protein help break down the ethanol in the liver			2
another suggestion -- enough to put you off drinking for life -- is @entity68 's offering of ' pizzle ' , the private parts of a bull			1
the @entity68 ' pizzle ' may not sound appealing but comes highly recommended by athletes it may not sound like something you fancy nibbling on on a sunday morning but the remedy comes highly indorsed			0
according to the graphic , athletes at the @entity77 requested this delicacy to give them stamina due to its super-high mineral , vitamin and hormone content			0
the traditional remedy from the @entity85 involves poaching fertilised duck eggs			1
@entity87 : the most appealing way to cure a hangover -- but might give you another one the more appealing options , if eyeballs and other interesting body parts are n't your cup of tea , include @entity99 's @entity98 milk , a mixture of cream , clotted cream , rum and liqueurs , and @entity106 's traditional serving of mince and cheese pie with chocolate milk			1
designer @entity109 , whose agency originally created these inforgraphics for their client cheapflights.co.uk , admits he has n't tried most of these recipes first hand			0
' we 've all tried an @entity18 fry up but the other remedies we researched online			0
funnily enough no one was keen to try out the birds droppings ! ' he said			0
the ancient @entity49 's used sheep lungs and owl eggs to relieve their sore heads morning after : the much - loved fry up is the @entity125 's hangover offering the @entity127 's concoction : tomato juice , raw egg and @entity131 sauce as a @entity87 luckily for the canary population , this remedy went out of fashion with the ancient @entity135 anyone for a fertilised duck egg embryo ? @entity138 from @entity139 : lime juice , fish stock and scraps can help motabolise alcohol faster @entity106 's recipe : mince and cheese pie , washed down with a glass of chocolate milk cure yourself the @entity151 way with a sausage fried in @entity153			1
