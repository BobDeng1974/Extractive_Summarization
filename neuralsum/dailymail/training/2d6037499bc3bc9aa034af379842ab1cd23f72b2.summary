writing on @entity6 with a picture of the ring , he explained : ' ok , so while scuba diving around @entity45 , @entity13 last week , i happened to find this ring			2
' unfortunately there is no way for me to know whether it was lost or intentionally thrown into the ocean			0
' assuming it was not the latter , i 'd like to find the owner so i can send it to them			0
mr @entity10 is desperate to reunite the ring with its owner but despite his high - profile campaign , nobody has yet come forward mr @entity10 had been scuba diving while staying at @entity45 in the @entity61 resort , pictured , when he came across the ring ' if you know a couple who was married on february 16th , 2013 , who lost a wedding band ( likely while diving ) near @entity4 , please have them contact me at @entity69			1
