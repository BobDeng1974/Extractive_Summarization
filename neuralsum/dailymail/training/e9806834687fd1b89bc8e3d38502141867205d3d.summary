in terms of his tweeting and everything else he does , none of that bothers me , it is what he does on the pitch that matters and he does it very well			0
’ @entity1 returned to action following injury during @entity7 ’s 2 - 2 draw with @entity53 earlier this month			1
that point took @entity56 ’s side to within one of safety , but their record on the road remains played five , lost five			2

‘ when i was under a difficult spell , just before the big disappointment at @entity84 ( 4 - 0 defeat ) , we were terrific but did n’t win a game			0
‘ i think that ’s where @entity7 are			2
they are better than the position they are in and we ’ll see that			0
‘ we wo n’t be surprised to get a tough game			0
i think there will be goals , hopefully we ’ll get one more than them			0

they play to win , like my teams , and are always on the front foot with flair			0
’ @entity20 , meanwhile , could enter the top four with a sixth straight victory in all competitions			2
it was back in 2012 that the @entity109 finished fifth , although @entity0 feels this team is more about pace on the break compared to the domination of that vintage			1
‘ this is a different squad and it has not got the experience of that team , ’ he said			0
‘ possession was the key to that team and this is slightly different			0
we can still win games , but we do not control the game in terms of possession			0
