@entity0 believed he had sampled the worst refereeing decision of his career the night he landed an early red card against @entity4			1
events at @entity6 on sunday forced him to revise his opinion			2
in the aftermath of a contentious @entity11 semi-final defeat to @entity12 , the @entity8 found sleep elusive			1
the claims of referee @entity15 and his five assistants that they failed to see the handball by @entity12 player @entity18 which denied @entity19 a penalty , a red card , possibly even a crack at the @entity23 , struck many at @entity25 as dubious			1
so dubious they fired off a letter seeking clarification from the @entity28			2
@entity19 centre back @entity0 leaves field following his side 's 3 - 2 to @entity12 in the @entity11 semi-final for @entity0 , the collective burst of myopia was remarkable			1
a greater lapse on a wider scale than the red card he received from @entity39 official @entity38 in the last 32 of the @entity40 in february ; a decision he described at the time as the worst he had experienced			1
resting his arms on a table in a @entity45 hotel after being shortlisted for the @entity47 player of the year award , the @entity8 said of the @entity49 flashpoint : ' yeah i saw it			2
i think everybody in the stadium saw everything			2
it ' s very strange that the right decision was n't made			2
' i was maybe near the halfway line			2
even in the stands you could see it			2
it was a miracle that we did n't get the right decision			2
@entity63 netted a superb free - kick against @entity12 but it was n't enough to secure victory ' this decision was terrible			1
i do n't know – i 've experienced some decisions lately			0
the @entity4 game , of course , was terrible for my feelings			1
' the decision on sunday was n't right and everyone can see it			2
it 's terrible when you think about it ' it was harder on my feelings ( than @entity4 )			1
i put the ref in a position in @entity4 to give me a red card ( following his challenges on @entity84 and @entity85 ) and that 's what i have to learn from			1
' sunday 's was a clear decision and it was n't made - and that 's a worse feeling			1
' wednesday 's 2 - 1 @entity92 win over @entity93 helped			1
it carried @entity19 another step closer to the title and was recuperative			1
the presence of two @entity25 players – @entity0 and @entity99 – on the @entity47 @entity101 shortlist suggests the season may yet redeem itself			0
@entity18 handled @entity105 goal - bound header but none of the officials saw it @entity63 is clear that punishing the @entity12 player would have been futile and pointless			1
the blame for what happened lies , he believes , with the officials who created the mess and then closed ranks to insist they simply had n't seen it			0
former @entity19 striker @entity115 has called on the officials to be held to account			1
but when @entity28 the freeze out their officials , it 's done behind closed doors , quietly and without ceremony			0
' i do n't know , ' said @entity0 , ' i do n't think i can give my opinion on that			0
i want to move forward as well			0
we 're not in the final			0
i want to win the league as soon as possible so we need to win on sunday and move forward			0
my feeling is you should n't be punished for someone else 's mistake			0
' @entity131 described the circumstances of the defeat to @entity12 as the worst of his career			1
the @entity19 manager returned home to stare at the walls while , for @entity0 , counting sheep proved an inadequate antidote to insomnia			1
' everybody was very down , especially after the game			2
for myself personally i was devastated , especially during the night , i could n't sleep that well			0
' that was the biggest chance to get the @entity23 and everyone at @entity19 , and i think around @entity19 as well , had the feeling that it was going to happen			1
' if the right decision had been made in the game on sunday we would have been in the final and we would hopefully have won the final			1
' the @entity23 was very close			0
but it 's not going to be turned around any more			0
' there are five games left now to change perceptions of the season			0
@entity19 expect to win the league			1
with five games left and an eight - point lead over @entity157 , they are almost there			1
thereafter what transpires between @entity160 and @entity12 in the @entity6 final on may 30 is a source of utter indifference for the likes of @entity0			1
' i go on holiday so i do n't think i will see it , ' he said			0
' after this season i do n't want to watch any football			0
i 've been the whole year watching and playing football and i have to be mentally rested for next season			0
i do n't think i will watch it			0
' from the comfort of a @entity176 lounger , he may give a little more time to his own future			0
nominated for a second successive season by @entity47 , there are times when the @entity182 game looks a little too easy for the 23 - year - old defender			1
for the sake of his own development , there is the expectation he will leave @entity19 this summer			1
@entity131 was angry at the referee 's decision to now send off @entity18 and award his side a penalty parrying questions on the matter , he insisted : ' my thoughts are that i want to win the league as soon as possible			1
' we 'll see what happens in the summer but for now i 'm a @entity19 player and we 'll see if that is or is n't the case after the summer			1
' it 's an amazing club and you do n't want to leave a club like this for one that is not as big			0
' you need to know what you want – you do n't need to lie			0
you have to be straight			0
i will be straight with everyone			0
' i 'm focusing on the present			0
you never know what will happen but for now i 'm enjoying being a @entity19 player			1
' his dilemma is clear			0
@entity19 are a large club in a small league			2
asked if a smaller club in a large league like @entity218 would be worth leaving for , he said : ' it depends on the club			0
if @entity19 was playing in the @entity92 then they would be one of the best clubs in the world and to stay here would be much more interesting than anything else			2
' it is what it is right now			0
i just want to win the league as soon as possible and hopefully get a nice game maybe before we have to go to @entity157			2
or maybe @entity157 away will be a nice place to win the championship … '			0
