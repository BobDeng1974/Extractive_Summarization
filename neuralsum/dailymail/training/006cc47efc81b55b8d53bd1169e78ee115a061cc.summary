by @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 16:14 est , 12 august 2013 the @entity1 has claimed in a publicly - released document that it only reviews .00004 % of internet traffic on a daily basis			1
the seven - page document , titled ' the @entity1 : missions , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , ' was released late friday			1
it compares the amount of @entity12 data that the @entity1 collects to the size of a dime on a basketball court			2
' according to figures published by a major tech provider , the @entity12 carries 1,826 petabytes of information per day			0
in its foreign intelligence mission , @entity1 touches about 1.6 % of that , ' the agency states			1
' however , of the 1.6 % of the data , only 0.025 % is actually selected for review			0
the net effect is that @entity1 analysts look at 0.00004 % of the world 's traffic in conducting their mission - that 's less than one part in a million			1
' put another way , if a standard basketball court represented the global communications environment , @entity1 's total collection would be represented by an area smaller than a dime on that basketball court			2
' the @entity1 ( shown in this 2006 photo ) has claimed in a publicly - released document that it only reviews .00004 % of internet traffic on a daily basis the @entity1 denies claims that is has used foreign partners to get around @entity45 laws			1
' @entity1 partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission , ' the agency states			1
' in every case , @entity1 does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what @entity1 is itself prohibited by law from doing			1
' these partnerships are an important part of the @entity45 and allied defense against terrorists , cyber threat actors , and others who threaten our individual and collective security			2
both parties to these relationships benefit			0
' the document has no attribution or contact information			0
it is dated august 9 , 2013 and was released on the same day that president @entity71 held a news conference about possible surveillance reforms			0
the document was released on the same day that president @entity71 held a news conference about possible surveillance reforms in defense of its internet - monitoring program , the @entity1 writes that the program was created in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , when the @entity1 ' did not have the tools or the database to search to identify [ terorrist ] connections and share them with the @entity86			1
' the paper concludes by stating that @entity1 personnel must report when they suspect the agency is overreaching or not acting within the law			0
' this self - reporting is part of the culture and fabric of @entity1 , ' the document reads			1
' we do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security ; both are integral to who we are as @entity45			0
@entity1 can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both			0
' below are excerpts from the @entity1 's seven - page document on internet surveillance programs : ' the @entity1 : missions , authorities , @entity7 and partnerships ' in the wake of recent unauthorized disclosures about some of our key intelligence collection programs , president @entity71 has directed that as much information as possible be made public , while mindful of the need to protect sources , methods and national security			1
acting under that guidance , the @entity120 has provided enhanced transparency on , and engaged in robust public discussion about , key intelligence collection programs undertaken by the @entity125 ( @entity1 )			2
' this is important not only to foster the kind of debate the president has called for , but to correct inaccuracies that have appeared in the media and elsewhere			0
this document is a step in that process , and is aimed at providing a succint description of @entity1 's mission , authorities , oversight and partnerships			2
' @entity139 ' after the @entity142 attacks on the @entity143 and the @entity144 , the @entity140 found that the @entity145 had failed to identify and connect the many " dots " of information that would have uncovered the planning and preparation for those attacks			0
' we now know that 9/11 hijacker @entity152 , who was on board @entity153 that crashed into the @entity144 , resided in @entity155 for the first six months of 2000			0
while @entity1 had intercepted some of @entity152 's conversations with persons in an @entity142 safe house in @entity160 during that period , @entity1 did not have the @entity45 phone number or any indication that the phone @entity152 was using was located in @entity165			1
' @entity1 did not have the tools or the database to search to identify these connections and share them with the @entity86			0
several programs were developed to address the @entity145 's need to connect the dots of information available to the intelligence community and to strengthen the coordination between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement agencies			0
' background ' @entity1 's challenge in an increasingly interconnected world - a world where our adversaries make use of the same communications systems and services as @entity45 and our allies - is to find and report on the communications of foreign intelligence value while respecting privacy and civil liberties			1
' we do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security - both are integral to who we are as @entity45			2
@entity1 can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both			0
' @entity199 of @entity200 ' @entity1 partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission			1
in every case , @entity1 does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what @entity1 is itself prohibited by law from doing			2
' the oversight and @entity212 ' @entity1 has an internal oversight and compliance framework to provide assurance that @entity1 's activities - its people , its technology and its operations - act consistently with the law and with @entity1 and @entity45 intelligence community policies and procedures			1
this framework is overseen by multiple organizations external to the @entity1 ... ' in addition to @entity1 's compliance safeguards , @entity1 personnel are obligated to report when they believe @entity1 is not , or may not be , acting consistently with law , policy , or procedure .			0

the @entity1 made the claims in a rare , publicly - released document defending its surveillance programs
the seven - page document was released late friday
@entity1 denies claims that is has used foreign partners to circumvent @entity45 laws
