by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 11:09 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 01:30 est , 17 june 2013 quizzed : senior @entity5 peer @entity3 has been interviewed by police under caution over allegations he sexually harassed women party activists @entity5 peer @entity3 was questioned by police yesterday over a ‘ torrent ’ of claims that he harassed and indecently assaulted women			1
the party ’s chief executive was questioned under caution for several hours over allegations he molested young activists			1
the claims surfaced in february when it emerged that a number of woman activists and party workers had complained of unwanted advances by @entity3 , who presided over ‘ training ’ weekends attended by hundreds of female party hopefuls			1
some claimed he tried to entice them to his bedroom			0
one threatened to blow the whistle at a tribunal before she was paid off			0
others said they were left ‘ shamed and humiliated ’			0
his solicitors said in a statement : ' we can confirm that @entity3 agreed to meet with the police and that he welcomed his first opportunity to refute the basis of allegations made against him			1
' the allegations , which surfaced on @entity46 in february , came from @entity47 , @entity48 , a former special adviser to @entity50 , and two unnamed women			2
mr @entity50 said the report made ‘ sobering reading ’ and said there was ‘ no excuse ’ for what had happened over 20 years in the party ’s corridors of power			1
others say they were left ‘ shamed and humiliated ’ during his alleged campaign of sexual harassment			0
one alleged he put his hands where they had ‘ no business being ’ and another branded him ‘ repugnant ’ for allegedly forcing his hand up her dress as they posed for a photo			0
@entity3 has said he was ‘ deeply shocked ’ by the allegations and described them as a ‘ total distortion ’ of his character			1
but last week @entity50 admitted he failed to respond vigorously enough to a series of sexual harassment complaints about his party ’s former chief executive			2
a formal inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding @entity3 , pictured ( left ) after a meeting in @entity82 in 2010 and ( right ) at this year ’s parliamentary pancake race the deputy prime minister ‘ made mistakes ’ over the allegations against @entity3 , according to a highly critical report into attitudes to women among senior @entity5			1
mr @entity50 conceded that ‘ women had been let down ’ after the independent report said he should have ‘ asked more questions ’ when the claims – which @entity3 denies – arose five years ago			1
@entity5 leader @entity50 admitted his party had failed women for 20 years there were several missed chances to hold an investigation , the report added			2
the inquiry into the wider culture of the @entity5 spanning two decades was launched after the @entity3 claims surfaced earlier this year			1
aside from the complaints by four women against the peer , witnesses reported 32 other sexual harassment and discrimination incidents – including one where a male parliamentarian had made inappropriate advances to a very young male worker			1
city fund manager @entity111 – who wrote the report – admitted she was ‘ shocked ’ at the party ’s failure to live up to its ideals of equality and liberty , adding : ‘ you have got to practise what you preach ’			2
mrs @entity111 , who found evidence of ‘ low level sexism ’ , said : ‘ mistakes were definitely made			0
they were made by @entity50 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
' you can make a mistake and learn from them , it ’s different from setting out to mislead or to do something wrong			0
’ but she added : ‘ i am not exonerating @entity50			0
’ a formal inquiry should have immediately been launched by mr @entity50 into the allegations of improper conduct involving @entity3 when they were raised by women in 2008 , she said			1
mr @entity50 said the report made ‘ sobering reading ’ and said there was ‘ no excuse ’ for what had happened over 20 years in the party ’s corridors of power			2
he added that it illustrated that ‘ stretching over a 20 - year period a series of mistakes were made which left a number of women feeling seriously let down and for that there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever ’			2
alleged victim @entity151 has said she decided to go public because @entity3 appeared back on the scene criticism : the @entity5 leadership was quickly accused of turning a ' blind eye ' when party activist @entity48 spoke to @entity157 mrs @entity111 also singled out @entity5 ministers @entity125 and @entity124 for adopting an ‘ informal ’ approach to the complaints which was ‘ ultimately not sufficient ’			1
the inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding @entity3 but it was widened to include how the party dealt with other complaints of sexism and harassment			1
it spanned complaints from up to 20 years ago			0
mrs @entity111 said it would not be fair however to hold the party to the same standards for events of decades ago that are expected today			2
her report said former leader @entity176 ’s ‘ relatively relaxed management style ’ , compared to his predecessor @entity177 ’s , ‘ contributed to @entity3 ’s power base ’			2
@entity178 , the party ’s chief whip at the time , was also told of the claims about @entity3 in 2008			1
businesswoman @entity111 said mr @entity50 should have ordered a formal inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment against @entity3 but the allegations did not surface publicly until this year , when @entity46 interviewed two alleged victims			1
at the time , the party denied that mr @entity50 had any knowledge of specific allegations about @entity3			1
he was also quick to criticise the ‘ self appointed detectives ’ of the media as newspapers also investigated the potential scandal			0
mrs @entity111 said there had been ‘ no malicious attempt ’ to cover up the claims but that the way they dealt with them had been ‘ haphazard ’			0
the deputy prime minister had not launched a formal inquiry because he believed the alleged victims had not requested one and wanted to keep their anonymity , she said			0
mr @entity50 told the inquiry : ‘ the natural course of action had been to challenge @entity2 [ @entity3 ] in respect of the allegations and this was duly done			1
he then denied any wrongdoing and the affair was dropped since none of the complainants wished to … substantiate their allegation			2
’ mrs @entity111 admitted she was ‘ shocked ’ by some of the complaints , such as one @entity5 councillor aggressively cornering a female staff member			0
mrs @entity111 criticised the ‘ tendency for the party to try to “ handle ” complaints rather than to fully and properly investigate them in a timely , professional manner			0
’ @entity224 is investigating allegations against the peer – who has denied any wrongdoing			1
mr @entity50 said he would implement all the recommendations made in miss @entity111 ’s report ‘ without delay ’ and had asked her to check on progress in 12 months			0
he admitted the party had to do more , adding : ‘ we must be a party where even a hint of sexism is taken seriously ; where every allegation of harassment is dealt with properly ; and where there can be no fear that power or position can be abused			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
