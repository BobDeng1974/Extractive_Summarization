created : 17:09 est , 19 august 2014 sensitive : nurses are visiting the elderly at home to see whether they would agree to a ' do not resuscitate ' order as part of an @entity7 questionnaire nurses are visiting the elderly at home to see whether they would agree to a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order			1
they are asking patients they have never met sensitive medical questions , including what should happen if their health suddenly fails			2
a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ – @entity16 – order instructs doctors not to try to restart a heart that has stopped beating			2
the questionnaires are part of an @entity7 scheme to improve care of the elderly and keep them out of hospital			1
it is not clear why @entity16 is on the forms			2
medical experts fear vulnerable patients will feel pressured into giving their consent simply to avoid causing trouble			1
@entity32 of the @entity33 said : ‘ i have never heard of anything like it			0
these questions are usually only asked when the nurse has developed a good and meaningful relationship with the patient			0
‘ only then will the nurse begin broaching these difficult subjects			0
‘ it is truly extraordinary within a few minutes of meeting someone to ask them where they want to die and to sign a form			0
nurses should n’t be put in that position			0
’ @entity48 , a health policy analyst whose mother was visited by a nurse with the form , described the policy as callous			0
‘ elderly , frail but otherwise healthy people are being asked , by complete strangers , to sign a form agreeing they should n’t be resuscitated , ’ he said			1
people will be frightened to death thinking the district nurses know something they do n’t and will feel obliged to sign the form so as not to be thought a nuisance			1
‘ this is a serious matter that ministers should be banning today			0
they are signing their lives away			0
‘ i would advise the relatives of anyone who gets this form to tell them not to sign it			0
’ the @entity72 has highlighted concerns that the @entity74 might have been hastening the deaths of elderly patients under the controversial @entity77			2
pressure : medical experts fear vulnerable patients will feel pressured into giving their consent simply to avoid causing trouble ( file photo ) the practice , which involves gradual withdrawal of food and fluid to ease the final hours of patients and is intended to spare them suffering invasive treatment , is now being scrapped by @entity90 had raised concerns that the pathway might be being used to free up beds			1
the @entity7 forms were sent out to gp practices in june , with district nurses visiting elderly patients ever since			1
they are targeting the over- 75s and patients with long - term conditions that put them at risk of needing to go to hospital unexpectedly			1
mr @entity48 was at his mother ’s home earlier this month when a district nurse she had never met arrived 45 minutes late for a scheduled appointment and started going through the form			2
within a few minutes the nurse asked his mother ‘ where would you like to die ’ , and then , ‘ if you ever need cardiopulmonary resuscitation do you agree to do not resuscitate ’			1
mr @entity48 – a former chairman of an @entity7 trust – said relatives of other elderly patients had contacted him to complain about the questionnaires			1
critics : health policy analyst @entity48 ( left ) said the question was callous , and @entity32 of the @entity33 ( right ) said @entity16 is usually only brought up if nurse has a good relationship with a patient controversy : the @entity72 has highlighted concerns over how the @entity74 was hastening the deaths of elderly patients under the controversial @entity77 two of them said district nurses had asked the highly sensitive questions over the telephone			1
@entity130 of @entity131 , a campaign group , said : ‘ it is completely inappropriate to ask a question like this out of the blue			0
‘ you normally only ask a question like that to someone who is terminally ill. ’ the three - page forms – personalised care plans – ask patients to give their name , address , date of birth and details of any illnesses and medication			1
they then ask whether emergency treatment or care has been discussed and state ‘ cardiopulmonary resuscitation – has the patient agreed a @entity16 ? ’ the forms also ask if the patient has drawn up an ‘ anticipatory care plan ’ – usually given to the terminally ill. this covers where they want to die and what drugs should be administered at the end of life			0
video courtesy of @entity164 last resort : a @entity16 order is meant to stop a patient suffering unnecessarily where their lives are likely to be extended for only a short period or if they are in great pain ( file photo ) such sensitive topics are usually broached only with patients known to be nearing the end of their lives – and by nurses or doctors in whom they trust			1
a @entity16 order is meant to stop a patient suffering unnecessarily where their lives are likely to be extended for only a short period or if they are in great pain			0
efforts to restart the heart through cardiopulmonary resuscitation are traumatic and often cause broken ribs and damage to organs such as the spleen			0
doctors estimate that only 10 to 15 per cent of patients are brought back to life with resuscitation.but there have been tragic cases when relatives and patients have not been told or forms have been put in notes accidentally			2
these include that of 86 - year - old @entity199 who died in hospital in @entity201 because a @entity16 form had mistakenly been placed in his notes and doctors did not try to resuscitate him			1
of the @entity16 question , an @entity7 spokesman said : ‘ as the form says this question should only be used if appropriate			1
‘ nurses should always use their discretion and compassion when dealing with patients especially on such sensitive issues			2
’ a @entity33 spokesperson said : ' open conversations are crucial to ensuring that patients can choose how they would like to be cared for at the end of their lives , including whether they would like to be resuscitated should their health decline			0
' nursing skills and experience can make a sensitive conversation more comfortable for all involved , but the conversation needs to happen at the right time and in the right way			0
' it should happen when it is relevant to the person concerned and when the patient has a trusting and familiar relationship with the nurse			0
it should not happen at a first meeting simply in order to complete a form			2

patients asked via form if they would agree to a ' do not resuscitate order '
