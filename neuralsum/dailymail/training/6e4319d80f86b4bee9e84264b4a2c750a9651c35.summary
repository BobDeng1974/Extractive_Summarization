they claim they left a drunken @entity11 in his room and put him in bed , before returning to @entity38 and @entity37 's suite to order room service			1
however , a private investigator hired by the family told @entity51 's 48 hours that the ship 's records show no details of any room service order			1

though the @entity1 has held the recording since 2005 , @entity64 made public its alleged contents for the first time			1

@entity97 said he believed the ' three men ' spotting was a mistake by the witness and says the men deny ever going onto the balcony			2
the neighbor said he later heard the sound of furniture being moved and a loud thud			0
the witness reports , cell phone video and room service logs have prompted the @entity135 to call for a thorough new look at @entity11 's death			1
' i just do n't understand how the @entity1 could have had this tape in their possession and still we sit here , ' @entity11 's sister @entity140 said			1
' get the guys in there			0
question them ! in another new detail , it has emerged that the men and their families were later ejected from the ship in @entity154 over a claim of sexual assault against @entity72 and @entity157			1

' something crazy went down that night and i hope one day they find out the truth , ' he said			0
@entity187 's lawyer says he has no doubt his client has provided all the information he has on the incident and believes it boils down to a drunken accident			0
' i do n't know why anybody 's missin ' the theme here			0
' cause there 's one common element ... and it 's too much alcohol ! ' he said			0
' and we can go and , you know , blame it on murder and - and -- and blame it on aggressive sexual behavior here			0
you know what ? it 's just everybody drinkin ' too much and stupid stuff happening			0
' @entity1 @entity211 confirmed to the broadcaster that they would review the investigation			1
the honeymooner 's family have been frustrated by the investigation to date but hope the renewed focus may bring them the answers they require			0
' we 'll get justice , ' @entity11 's mother @entity222 said			1
' somehow we 'll get justice for @entity11			2
and shame on them that do n't			0
