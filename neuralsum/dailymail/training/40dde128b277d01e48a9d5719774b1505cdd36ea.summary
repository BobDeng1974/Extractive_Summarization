by @entity0 published : 19:46 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 19:48 est , 29 january 2014 bold scheme : but @entity6 's plan to offer free school meals to all young state school children is in chaos , @entity4 sources have said @entity6 ’s flagship plan to extend free school meals to all young state school children is in chaos – with thousands likely to have to eat cold packed lunches in classrooms , according to @entity4 sources			1
the deputy prime minister announced at the last @entity16 conference that all children between the ages of five and seven would qualify for the free meals from september 2014			1
but even some colleagues concede that the £ 785 million scheme was dreamt up ‘ on the back of a fag packet ’ and its funding is now in turmoil			1
sources at the @entity28 say mr @entity6 failed to take into account the cost of upgrading kitchen facilities to meet the demand , forcing the government to offer £ 150million to pay for the building work			1
but the rush to introduce the new entitlement before the 2015 general election means that there is no time to determine which schools and local authorities genuinely need cash			0
so councils such as @entity44 and @entity45 in @entity46 , which have already upgraded their school facilities , will get extra funding while others which say they need more assistance will not get it			0
though initially the government pledged a ‘ hot , nutritious meal ’ for all children in reception and years one and two , ministers have also now accepted that not all schools have the space to provide one			1
cold packed lunches eaten at classroom desks will also qualify , since many schools do not have dedicated dining rooms and use gyms and school halls to serve lunch			1
heads say space used for teaching and activities can not be turned over for extended lunchtimes accommodating many more students			0
sir @entity73 , a former @entity16 defence minister , said : ‘ it ’s no great surprise that these practical reasons have arisen given that the whole policy appears to have been dreamt up overnight and sketched out on the back of a fag packet			1
' it sounds as if the meals are going to be as half - baked as the policy			0
’ despite @entity83 ’s vast budget deficit , mr @entity6 announced that regardless of their parents ’ income , all children in the first three years of primary school will qualify for free school meals - saving even the best - off families an average of £ 437 a year per child			1
the annual cost of the scheme is to be met through spending cuts elsewhere and moves to clamp down on tax avoidance			0
however , critics have questioned the coherence of offering free school meals for all families with young children , while taking the axe to other universal payments such as child benefit for the better - off			1
currently , free school meals are limited to the 400,000 poorest families , and many of those who are entitled do not claim because of the stigma attached to doing so			0
extending them to all under - sevens in state education is designed to show the coalition is taking further steps to help families with the cost of living			0
big giveaway : the deputy prime minister announced at the last @entity16 conference that all children between the ages of five and seven would qualify for the free meals from september 2014 the plan was part of a @entity16 deal with the @entity125 that meant them agreeing to a similar sum being spent on a £ 200 - a - year tax break for married couples			1
but the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) is warning that many schools ‘ absolutely ca n’t think how they are going to do this ’			0
furthermore , the change threatens to undermine another flagship @entity16 policy - the pupil premium , which means that schools receive £ 900 a year more for every child who currently qualifies for free school meals			1
critics predict that still fewer families will come forward to declare their income , given that in future they will qualify for free food whether they do so or not			0
some councils are also predicting the scheme will lead to deep cuts elsewhere in the education budget			0
@entity149 says it is facing a £ 9million shortfall in the funding needed to upgrade kitchens and dining rooms at its schools in order to deliver the pledge			2
@entity158 said it had been offered just £ 1.1million , despite facing an estimated £ 10 million bill			0
the council ’s @entity125 leader @entity160 said : ‘ the minute this announcement was made , councils across the country strongly suspected that they would not receive the full funding from central government to deliver on this pledge			2
‘ sadly we look like being proved right , and @entity158 is no exception			0
‘ if the deputy prime minister makes pledges like this relating to locally delivered services , they need to make sure they are properly funded			2
we have let central government know of our unhappiness as regards this situation and we will continue to do so			2
’ the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) warned there was a danger that communities could be ‘ short - changed ’ unless ministers produce more cash to pay for the refurbishments needed .			2

former @entity16 minister *slams* ' back of a fag packet ' accounting
government sources say @entity6 failed to account for upgrading kitchens
now ministers forced to concede that some children will get cold lunches
