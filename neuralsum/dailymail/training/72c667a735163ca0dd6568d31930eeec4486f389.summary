by @entity0 @entity1 : 03:15 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:55 est , 30 december 2013 message : senior @entity5 official @entity4 has said that @entity6 should be more worried about bankers ' stealing ' than beggars from his country @entity6 should be far more worried about bankers ' stealing ' billions than @entity5 who will come to beg on the streets from the @entity16 , a senior @entity12 official has said			1
@entity4 , an adviser to the country 's prime minister , believes migrants from his nation should be given the chance to settle in the @entity6			1
the 43 - year - old , who is also a @entity5 , said he expected relatively few would make the journey to the @entity6 when the restrictions on the movement of @entity12 and @entity26 in the @entity27 are lifted on january 1			1
mr @entity4 said they did not like @entity6 because it was too cold and predicted that only around 2,000 to 3,000 would travel to the @entity6 this winter			1
' the @entity5 begging in the streets are obvious because we see them , they ask for one pound or one euro and they bother us			0
yet some of the people in the banks are stealing billions of euros but nobody sees them because they are on the 60th floor , ' he told @entity39			1
' seventy per cent of @entity5 that left from @entity12 in the last 10 years are integrated			2
they have kids that go to school and they act like active citizens and taxpayers in the places where they are			0
' he added that groups who set up camp on @entity52 on several occasions this year were the ' exception '			0
@entity12 has around two million @entity5 and there are 750,000 in @entity26 , although many have already left for @entity57 seeking work since the countries joined the @entity27 in 2007			2
estimate : mr @entity4 says that @entity6 's cold weather will put off migrants , and he expects around 3,000 to enter after @entity6 after january 1 migrants from these countries coming to @entity6 in the @entity16 could put huge pressure on housing , schools and hospitals , a major report warned last week			1
the study by the centre - left @entity71 says most of the new arrivals will settle in @entity74 and the @entity75 – meaning public services in these areas will be most affected			0
it warns that @entity6 could see an increase in anti-social behaviour , aggressive begging , rough sleeping and criminality from next week			2

and it says @entity95 ’s much heralded changes to benefits rules are ‘ largely symbolic ’ and will make little or no difference			0
