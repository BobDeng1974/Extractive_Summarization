by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 02:42 est , 21 november 2012 supermarkets have been accused of fuelling an obesity crisis with ‘ irresponsible ’ promotions on sugary junk food			1
discounts and buy one , get one free deals are skewed towards unhealthy products , according to a study			1
prices and nutrition data across 6,000 food and drink items sold over a year by @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 ’s and @entity16 were analysed by the @entity18 ’s @entity17			1
fuelling obesity : researchers claim buy one , get one free deals are geared towards unhealthy foods professor @entity22 , head of the business school , said : ‘ we found a bias towards sugary products for price promotions and that straight price discounts are on average more skewed towards unhealthy products			1
’ a snapshot survey yesterday found , for example , that @entity13 has a £ 1 offer on boxes of @entity33 and tubes of @entity35 fair trade buttons and @entity36 , and price drops of up to 50 per cent on @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity42 products			2
@entity14 ’s current deals include two £ 1.98 bottles of @entity45 for £ 2.50 , while @entity15 ’s offers include a 58 per cent saving on a @entity48 tin , bringing the price down to £ 5			0
survey : more than 6,000 products sold by the @entity53 's biggest supermarkets were analysed - with sugary products having the best promotion deals @entity53 ’s obesity rate has risen from 15 per cent to 26 per cent since 1993 , while projections suggest 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women will be obese by 2050			1
just over a third of ten and 11 - year - olds are overweight or obese but in many areas the rates are far higher , @entity64 figures show			0
the worst is @entity65 , @entity66 , where 42 per cent are deemed too fat			0
in four other boroughs of the capital – @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 – the figure is 41 per cent			0
they are closely followed by @entity75 , near @entity76 , where 40 per cent of 11 - year - olds are overweight or obese , and @entity78 , where it is 39 per cent			0
last week the government signed a voluntary ‘ @entity88 ’ with supermarkets and food companies to boost the promotion of fruit and vegetables , but professor @entity22 said more radical action was needed			1
‘ what is required is a comprehensive move away from price promoting unhealthy foods rather than token gestures for marketing spin , ’ he added			2
‘ it is simply irresponsible for supermarkets to overly promote foods with high sugar and fat content			0
food producers can do more by reducing the fat , sugar and salt content of processed foods , while food retailers can ensure healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable , and that they practise responsible marketing			0
‘ responsibility lies with both retailers and producers , otherwise regulation might be needed			0
’ @entity111 of the @entity112 , which speaks for supermarkets , said : ‘ there ’s no such thing as an unhealthy food , only an unhealthy diet			1
‘ retailers have been encouraging people to eat more fruit and vegetables with innovative products , prominent promotions and competitive pricing for years			2

research by the @entity18 ’s @entity17 found *special* offers are skewed towards unhealthy products
figures *revealed* just a week after government and supermarkets signed ‘ @entity88 ’ to boost the promotion of fruit and vegetables
