by @entity0 last updated at 12:10 pm on 1st september 2011 the discovery of a human foot in a rubber - soled shoe washed up on the @entity5 coast near @entity6 has deepened a four - year mystery			1
dna testing is under way but police are at a loss to explain how it got there			1
the macabre find brings to a dozen the number of human feet – all in rubber soled shoes – which have been discovered since august 2007			1
the first foot was later linked to a man whose name police withheld at the request of his family			1
@entity24 discovery : police in @entity6 investigate after a human foot inside a running shoe washed ashore it has been suggested that the feet , which are both male and female , could be from victims of the @entity33 tsunami in 2004 , or even be the work of a serial killer			1
what seemed initially like a bizarre coincidence has over the years become the subject of a major investigation by the @entity25 and @entity41 's coroner 's office			0
nobody , however , has been able to offer a definite explanation as to what is happening - or identify who all of the feet belong to			1
the latest limb to be found was discovered floating in the water along the shore of @entity6 's @entity49 , which wraps around the downtown area			0
part of leg bone was still attached , police said			2
detectives cordoned off the area and the @entity41 coroner was called in			0
@entity6 police spokeswoman constable @entity57 said there was no indication how the remains got there and further forensic examination will be required			2
' it was quite disturbing - quite a discovery to make , ’ she added			0
mystery : no one has been able to offer a definitive explanation as to where the feet are coming from - or who they belong to according to reports in the @entity5 press , the discoveries date back to august 2007 when a man 's foot was found on @entity75 , northeast of @entity76 in @entity41			1
the foot was later linked to a deceased male whose name police withheld at the request of his family			1
over the next four years they have turned up with occasional regularity , always clad in a rubber soled shoe			0
during one 11 month period six feet washed up , although it has been six months since the latest discovery			2
initially it was thought that all the feet had come from four men who died in a light aircraft crash off the @entity92 of @entity5 in february 2005			2
however in august 2006 the theory fell apart with the discovery of a fifth right foot , meaning that something else was to blame			2
since then a number of explanations have been put forward - some suggested the limbs might be from stowaways who smuggled themselves onto a container ship as it left @entity6			0
false @entity49 : the waterway where the twelfth severed foot was found others claimed the feet could be from victims of the @entity109 in 2004 , or part of a human trafficking ring			1
but when it emerged that one had apparently been deliberately severed , rumours began spreading that a serial killer with a twisted calling card might be at work			1
detectives frantically combed the missing person ’s database for clues but later said they believed the the feet appeared to have come off the bodies naturally , and that foul play was not suspected			0
men and women are among those whose feet have come ashore , but as yet only the one male has been positively identified - with no explanation as to how they got there			0
complicating matters were claims by oceanographer @entity133 who has said that the feet could have drifted as far as 1,000 miles			0
pranksters have also made the investigation more difficult			0
in 2008 they planted a hoax ‘ foot ’ on @entity136 which renewed interest in the case .			0

dna testing is underway but police are *unsure* how the foot got there
