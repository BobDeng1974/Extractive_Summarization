@entity5 suffered in silence for the best part of three years but eventually walked out when her mentor made it clear her future career depended on giving in to his sexual demands			2
new role : @entity1 , left , has met @entity5 , right who she will play in film @entity28 @entity29 , the writer of the @entity31 drama , said : ‘ everyone knows @entity4 was keen on his blondes			1
unfortunately for @entity5 , he developed a twisted and obsessive love for her that left her feeling isolated and terrified			2
he made repeated sexual advances towards her and tried to take over her life			2
‘ today we would call it sexual harassment but that concept had not been accepted back then			2
’ the new film is inspired by the biographer @entity43 ’s account of the couple ’s relationship in his 2008 book @entity47			0
@entity4 ’s infatuation with @entity5 began in 1961 when he spotted her by chance in a television commercial for a diet drink			1
convinced he had found the next @entity53 , the director ignored the fact that @entity5 had no real acting experience and signed her up for the starring role in 1963 film @entity8			0
controlling : @entity5 pictured with @entity4 at a screening of the birds in @entity60 , @entity61 in 1963 @entity5 in a scene from the birds the director of @entity64 and @entity65 immediately set about transforming her into the perfect @entity67 icon and took control of all aspects of her life , including her off - set wardrobe and diet			1
divorcee @entity5 – whose daughter @entity74 grew up to be a major @entity67 star in her own right – was initially grateful for the director ’s attention			0
but she grew more and more fearful as his obsession began to spiral out of control , first on the set of @entity8 and then during production on their follow - up film , @entity86			2
@entity4 , who had taken to incessantly staring at @entity5 between takes , banned her from sharing cars with her male co-stars and insisted that all their conversations took place in private so they could be alone together			1
@entity4 's obsession with @entity5 eventually destroyed both their careers the film maker photographed to showcase the 1955 tv series , @entity97 @entity98 , left , and @entity5 , right in a scene from @entity101 's film , @entity86 as well as bombarding her with unwanted gifts , he had her followed around town and , totally obsessed , even sent examples of her handwriting to graphologists			1
@entity5 , who had signed a seven - year contract with the director , put up with his harassment because she was fearful he would blacklist her if she spoke out			0
but she finally quit when he made it clear on the set of @entity86 that she would never work again unless she gave in to his sexual demands			0
