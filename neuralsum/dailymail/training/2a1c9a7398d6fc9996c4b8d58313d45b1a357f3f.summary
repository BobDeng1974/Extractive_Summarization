by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 2 august 2013 @entity1 was caught up in a new mis - selling scandal last night over its campaign to sign up energy customers			0
more than 200,000 households now get their gas and electricity through @entity8 but it is claimed many were misled over savings being offered			1
for five years the retailer has had salesmen approaching shoppers in - store and persuading them to sign up on the spot to switch their energy supplier			1
mis - selling : an @entity8 whistleblower claims sales staff used tricks to bamboozle clients into signing up to new energy deals even though they might cost them more than their old supplier some of the sales teams earned up to £ 3,000 a week in commission for getting the signatures			1
but the @entity27 has learnt that @entity8 has suddenly banned its salesmen from signing up new customers in store because it wants to avoid further accusations of mis - selling			1
the company could now face claims from thousands of customers and any victims referred to the @entity37 could be paid compensation of up to £ 5,000 each			0
@entity8 has accepted that some customers may have been mis - sold contracts but claim it was ‘ less than one per cent of customers ’			1
a whistleblower has told how staff were trained to target @entity8 customers nicknamed ‘ @entity46 ’ – meaning ageing women who would be keen on saving money and easy to sign up			1
inviting : an @entity8 energy sales leaflet the source claimed sales staff used a host of tricks to bamboozle clients into signing up , even though the new deals might cost them more than their old supplier			1
the root of the problem was ‘ comparison books ’ given to all @entity8 staff			1
these were supposed to show customers accurate prices for gas and electricity from their existing suppliers , such as @entity68 , and the prices being offered by @entity8			1
but the books rounded up prices to the nearest £ 50 , leaving scope for staff to mislead			0
realising the danger the books represent , bosses have demanded staff return them all – with threats of the sack if any are kept			0
the in - store sales teams are still being paid but have been forbidden from signing people up , the key part of their job			1
all they can do is direct potential customers to go online or phone the @entity8 helpline – as in both cases all details of the transaction are either audio - recorded or retained on computer , meaning the firm can fight any compensation claims			2
the whistleblower said : ‘ i ’ve worked for @entity8 for years – and while their party line is that only one per cent of customers were mis - sold to , most of us think it ’s a lot more than that			1
‘ as far as i ’m concerned the only people i did n’t mis - sell to were the tiny minority who brought their energy bills with them so they could do a proper comparison , or the small percentage who did genuinely save with us			0
‘ our pay is around £ 12,500 - £ 15,000 a year basic plus commission – and sometimes that commission was £ 3,000 a week			0
‘ before we were told to sign people up on the spot , and if we were n’t meeting targets they sent us to find a “ @entity46 ” , the official training term for an older woman considered easy to sell to			2
‘ people rarely had their bills on hand , which you need for a proper price comparison , so we used all sorts of tricks to get them to sign up , including doing rough estimates of their energy use based on the size of their home , but which we could stretch to our advantage			0
’ when the @entity27 made undercover visits to @entity8 stores across the country this week , all the @entity8 staff we could find refused to sign us			2
@entity1 : the whistleblower told how staff were trained to target @entity8 customers nicknamed ' @entity46 ' meaning ageing women who would be keen on saving money and easy to sign up the scheme is run in partnership with energy firm @entity144 and @entity145 , which @entity8 bosses are blaming for the looming crisis			1
when it was launched five years ago , @entity8 executive @entity148 said : ‘ the energy sector can be quite complex and we want to make it simpler for our customers			2
’ the relationship with @entity154 soured in april when it was fined a record £ 10.5million by energy regulator @entity155 for ripping off up to one million customers			0
mps and consumer groups called for criminal prosecutions for fraud as it emerged that many customers were persuaded to sign up to get gas and electricity from @entity154 after salesmen , including those in @entity8 stores , assured them they would save			2
in fact their bills rocketed , sometimes by hundreds of pounds a year			0
last night an @entity8 spokesman admitted that its energy salesmen were no longer allowed to sign up customers in store – and effectively accepted that its previous sales process had not followed ‘ best practice ’			2
according to a @entity1 spokesman the energy salesman are no longer allowed to sign people up to energy contracts in store the spokesman said : ‘ this is a past issue which @entity154 has taken action to resolve			0
we take our responsibility for selling energy very seriously and believe our new in - store sales process follows best practice by allowing our customers to finalise the sale process at home , staying in control of the final decision making			2
’ the spokesman added that the ‘ comparison books ’ seized back from staff were due to be replaced with computer tablets , but said @entity155 accepted they had been ‘ compliant ’ with regulations			0
she said there was nothing unusual for a company to require staff to return old work property			0
@entity203 of the @entity205 pressure group said : ‘ energy suppliers have begun to realise that poor behaviour has eroded customer confidence – hopefully we ’ll see better behaviour in the future			0

over 200,000 households get their gas and electricity through @entity8
it is now believed many were misled over the savings being offered
@entity221 approached shoppers in - store persuading them to switch supplier
prime targets were *allegedly* older women who were nicknamed ‘ @entity46 ’
