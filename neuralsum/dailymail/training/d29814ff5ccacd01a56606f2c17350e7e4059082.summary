ever since a book called ' @entity12 ' by @entity13 was released two years ago the search for the fabled treasure has lured legions of hunters to the scene of old mine workings in eastern @entity20 seeking the fortune estimated at over 150 million pounds			1
@entity13 interviewed foresters , policemen , miners and old nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near @entity29 in east @entity20			1
missing treasure : @entity32 seekers are rasing the woods of east @entity20 in the hunt for the @entity9 , seen here recreated in 2003 , widely regarded as the world 's most important missing art treasure but now a borehole has been discovered in the village of @entity39 in @entity40 which mayor @entity41 says is a dig too far			1
‘ this is a place of rest for 42 victims of the @entity25 , ’ he said			2
’ it is too much			0
it is the work of the treasure hunters			1
’ @entity13 goes into detail in his book about old silver , cobalt and uranium mine workings that , at nearly 6,000 feet underground , were the deepest in @entity20 with some shafts and galleries dating back to the middle ages			1
eyewitness reports from the time speak of a special @entity60 commando unit turning up at the wood early in 1945 , sealing it off and dumping a secret cargo in it			0
with @entity20 shattered and its transportation infrastructure in ruins , believers say it must have been a singularly important cargo they hid there			1
treasure hunter 's bible : the puzzle of @entity73 by @entity13 has guided fortune seekers to the east @entity20 woods searchers have found rotting wooden storage crates from @entity78 in the woods but none have discovered the entrance to the cave system where the treasure allegedly lies			1
crafted entirely out of amber , gold and precious stones , the @entity9 , made of numerous panels , was a masterpiece of baroque art and widely regarded as the world 's most important missing art treasure			1
when its 565 candles were lit it was said to ' glow a fiery gold '			0
it was presented to @entity95 in 1716 by the @entity96 and , later , @entity97 commissioned a new generation of craftsmen to embellish the room			0
she had moved it from the @entity102 in @entity103 to her new summer abode in @entity105 , outside the city			0
the room was seized by marauding @entity8 troops during their onslaught on @entity110 in 1941			0
@entity113 count @entity111 , the @entity20 ' ' art protection officer ' and holder of a degree in art history , supervised the room 's transport to @entity120 in what was then @entity122			2
in january 1945 , after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city , the room was lost , many believing it was burned to pieces in the fighting			0
@entity130 became the @entity110 enclave of @entity132 and ever since the @entity9 has become the new @entity133 for those who choose to believe it survived ; a quest that enthralled the wealthy and the poor alike			2
the @entity138 author @entity137 founded the @entity139 to track it down once and for all			0
everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work			0
the @entity20 official in charge of the amber shipment said the crates were in a castle that burned down in an air @entity150 think the room sank to the bottom of the @entity154 in a torpedoed steamer used by the @entity25 , or that it was hacked up by @entity157 troops and sent home like sticks of rock as souvenirs of their conquest			2
a 2010 dig by a @entity110 treasure hunter in @entity132 failed to turn it up			0
now all eyes are on the wood in eastern @entity20 that has become the new magnet for those who never stop dreaming of gold .			2
