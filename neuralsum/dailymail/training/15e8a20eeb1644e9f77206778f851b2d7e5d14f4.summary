@entity1 lawmakers are weighing in on the debate whether to make it easier for transgender people to change the sex on their birth certificates			2
the @entity8 's @entity7 has scheduled a hearing monday on a plan supported by transgender rights advocates			1
it would eliminate a requirement for people to have gender - reassignment surgery in order to change the documents			1
welcome changes : @entity19 , 20 , a transgender man born and raised in @entity1 , failed to get his birth certificate reissued last year instead , a health professional would be able to affirm that the change would more accurately reflect the person 's gender			1
@entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 have removed surgery requirements			1
@entity1 issues its own birth certificates			0
the city @entity33 voted last month to solicit public comment on the proposed change			2
@entity19 , 20 , a transgender man born and raised in @entity1 , failed to get his birth certificate reissued last year			1
he told @entity37 that ' it was kind of weird , because @entity1 is such a liberal place			0
' the easy - going student , interested in information technology and counseling work , says he finds it deeply frustrating that he can not change the sex on his birth certificate and it leads to ' uncomfortable moments			2
' when applying for jobs , he has to spend an awkward minute or two before handing over his identify documents to explain himself , hoping to preempt an interviewer 's confusion			2
he is studying for a bachelor 's degree in criminal justice and wants to apply to graduate schools , but worries whether admissions officers will look kindly upon a birth certificate that contradicts who he says he is			2
in the same vein , thousands of transgender people across @entity60 have been forced into embarrassing encounters with bureaucrats , officials , landlords and others because of discrepancies with their documentation , according to transgender - rights advocacy groups			1
last month , @entity1 officials announced that they would try to change the law to let people such as @entity19 alter the sex on their birth certificate			0
if successful , the city would join a growing movement that views gender as a complex , mainly mental phenomenon in which a person 's external anatomy is no longer the overriding factor			1
in theory , most parts of the country , except @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , already allow transgender people to amend their birth certificates , according to @entity91 , an advocacy group			2
in practice , most jurisdictions , including @entity1 , ask for proof from a doctor that they have had surgery to alter the appearance of their genitals			2
this excludes the majority of transgender men and women			0
in a 2008 survey of more than 7,000 transgender people , only 20per cent of trans women said they had had surgery to remove their penis and testes , and only two percent of trans men said they had had male genitals surgically created			1
some say they can not afford the complex surgery			0
many others , including @entity19 , do not need or want it , finding hormone therapy sufficient			0
besides the usual risks of major surgery , it leaves the person infertile , and some find the results less than satisfactory			1
even some people who have had surgery find the requirements intrusive , arguing that few non-transgender people would tolerate civic officials questioning them about their genitalia			1
@entity131 , the city council member leading the effort to loosen the city 's 43 - year - old rules , calls the surgery requirements outdated			1
' i look at this as a matter of human rights , ' he said in a telephone interview			0
' transgender people deserve to have vital documents , especially birth certificates , that accurately reflect their identity			0
' he expects the council to pass his bill before the year is out			1
he is working in tandem with the city 's health commissioner , dr. @entity149 , who has proposed amending the city 's health code to match @entity131 's bill			1
under the new proposals , a transgender person need only submit an affidavit from a doctor , nurse , counselor or other licensed health worker testifying that the applicant is indeed of the gender they claim			1
in 2006 , the @entity33 unexpectedly scrapped a similar proposal after a last - minute volley of concerns that hospitals , jails and schools would not know where to put transgender people			1
@entity131 thinks those concerns have faded			1
the only feedback he has seen are notes of gratitude from transgender @entity1			0
some said they have been waiting for this change for decades			0
' i do think public sentiment has changed for the better in these intervening eight years , ' he said			0
in that time , @entity27 , the @entity26 , @entity28 , @entity25 and @entity26 have all dropped the surgery requirement			0
@entity30 followed suit earlier this year , although this did not affect @entity1 's independent records system			2
in 2010 , the federal government began allowing transgender people to amend their passports regardless of anatomy			2
last year , the @entity188 said it no longer considered being transgender a disorder			2
for @entity19 , who plans to address public hearings on the proposals later this month , a change in the city 's law would help ease the long , laborious process of transitioning			1
in the last couple of years , he has legally changed his name from @entity200 to @entity201			0
he had his driver 's license amended , and the @entity203 updated his records without fuss			0
and the registrar 's office at @entity208 obliged @entity19 's request to update their records			0
each step in gaining official recognition of his identity leads to the next one , he says , but there are others besides the city 's vital records office that still doubt him			1
his parents , with whom he lives , ' tolerate ' his transition , he said , but still call him @entity222 and refer to him using female pronouns			0
in recent weeks , a man at his local mosque has started to protest @entity19 's entering the men 's section to pray			0
@entity19 is considering asking the imam to intervene			0
if @entity1 were willing to recognize him as a man , he said , it might mean that his parents , his imam and others may come to see him that way , too .			0
