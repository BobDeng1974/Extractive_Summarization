a new report from the @entity1 shows inmates released from the @entity4 military detention center at @entity5 , @entity6 are still returning to the battlefield and fighting against the @entity4 and other @entity9 nations			1
since releases began under president @entity11 , 116 men held in the facility famous for interrogations and orange jumpsuits have been ' confirmed of reengaging ' in hostilities , according to @entity17			1
of those , 23 are back in custody and 25 are dead – including some killed by @entity4 drone strikes and other military operations			1
but 68 are at large , including 5 released by president @entity22 since his 2008 campaign pledge to close ' @entity24 ' forever			1
another 69 are ' suspected of reengageing , ' and 55 of them are on the loose			0
@entity27 , the @entity4 director of national intelligence , testified in a feb. 26 @entity30 hearing that 2014 will go down as the deadliest year for terrorism since records were first kept @entity33 , @entity6 is a political flashpoint with republicans wanting to keep terrorists outof harm 's way and @entity38 believing the facility 's continued operation inflames hostilities against @entity4 @entity22 's batting average looks far better than @entity11 's on paper			1
more than 20 per cent of the @entity5 detainees released by order of the former president are once again considered enemy combatants in the war on terror			1
among @entity22 's releases , that number barely hits 5 per cent			1
but a retired @entity4 military intelligence officer told @entity53 that the numbers are misleading			1
' no one gets out of @entity5 , goes right back to the front lines , and winds up in a @entity58 report in the same week , ' he said thursday			0
' it can take months or years for them to feel confident enough to start waging jihad again , out in the open , with the @entity4 and their host government keeping tabs on them			0
' ' and @entity17 can only put in a public report what it can confirm			0
that sometimes takes even more years			0
' the source spoke on condition of anonymity			0
' are there more @entity11 transfers back at it than @entity22 transfers ? probably not , ' he said			1
' but the intelligence community has had more than six years to track @entity11 's			1
six years from now @entity22 's numbers will look pretty much the same			1
' ' these guys do n't rejoin @entity80 overnight			1
' 203 @entity81 123 @entity82 63 @entity83 22 @entity84 17 @entity85 14 @entity86 @entity87 @entity88 @entity89 11 @entity90 @entity91 9 @entity92 9 @entity93 9 @entity94 8 @entity95 7 @entity96 6 @entity97 6 @entity98 6 @entity99 6 @entity100 5 @entity101 5 @entity102 5 @entity103 4 @entity104 @entity105 – source : @entity108 / @entity107 speaking to the fact - checking website @entity112 in january , a spokesman for @entity111 @entity110 sen. @entity110 echoed that sentiment			2
' it can take some time for us to identify ( former detainees ) on the field of battle , ' said the spokesman , @entity120 , ' and it would make sense that some recent releases may not yet have been identified or engaged			1
' director of national intelligence @entity27 concludes his report by predicting that the problem of @entity5 recidivism is n't going away			1
' based on trends identified during the past eleven years , we assess that some detainees currently at @entity33 will seek to reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities after they are transferred , ' his report reads			2
spokespersons for the @entity134 in the @entity135 directed questions back to @entity17			0
the @entity135 typically negotiates terms of release with foreign governments that will accept prisoners , often their home countries			0
to date at least 55 nations have taken them in , with the @entity4 enforcing varying conditions on their release			0
@entity81 leads the list , folllowed by @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
thosase four countries alone are now home to more than 400 former @entity5 prisoners			0
@entity84 has destabilized in recent weeks with the ouster of its @entity4 - backed government , raising concerns about the status of the 22 men repatriated there			2
@entity22 sent six of them in 2009 , according to data compiled by @entity108 and @entity107			1
but even in a more stable country like @entity92 , the destination for nine former @entity162 inmates – and even when the @entity4 places residency and other restrictions on prisoner releases – @entity27 admits some will pick up where they once left off			2
' while enforcement of transfer conditions may deter reengagement by many former detainees and delay reengagement by others , ' his report reads , ' some detainees who are determined to reengage will do so regardless of any transfer conditions			2
' the @entity22 administration has clear guidelines about what qualifies as terrorist recidivism			1
' planning terrorist operations , conducting a terrorist or insurgent attack against @entity184 or host - nation forces or civilians , conducting a suicide bombing , financing terrorist operations , recruiting others for terrorist operations , and arranging for movement of individuals involved in terrorist operations ' are all activities that qualify			2
communicating with other former @entity162 prisoners or propagandizing against the @entity4 , by themselves , do n't count			2
@entity196 , extended stay : president @entity22 pledged to close the prison by early 2010 but has struggled to transfer , try or release the remaining detainees from the facility new concerns about stocking @entity203 terror armies with new recruits via @entity5 releases come as terrorism incidences and casualties are on the rise			1
' in 2013 , just over 11,500 terrorist attacks world - wide killed approximately 22,000 people , ' @entity27 told a @entity30 panel on feb. 26			2
' preliminary data for the first nine months of 2014 reflect nearly 13,000 attacks , which killed 31,000 people			0
' ' when the final accounting is done , 2014 will have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled , ' he said			2
the sprawling @entity5 prison complex on the island of @entity6 is still home to 122 detainees , a number that the @entity135 wants to see dip below 100 in order to make the facility 's eventual closure seem inevitable			1
fully 55 of them have already been cleared to go			0
the @entity4 secretary of defense , by statute , makes the final determination about which @entity5 prisoners must stay and which can be resettled in less restrictive settings			0
former @entity236 chief @entity235 's departure was reportedly brought about , in part , because of his reluctance to agree with all the @entity135 's recommendations			2
new defense secretary @entity240 has not yet demonstrated his thinking with a raft of new release announcements			0
@entity244 : @entity245 want to pass a 2 - year moratorium on new @entity5 prisoner releases but the last month a quartet of @entity245 senators led by @entity250 of @entity251 introduced a bill that would make it harder to send anyone home from @entity5			1
it has already been approved by the @entity257			0
the legislation would temporarily prohibit the @entity135 from releasing any of the remaining inmates if they were determined to be ' high ' or ' medium ' risk hen they were first captured , regardless of the current assessment of military brass			2
the congressional time - out would last for two years , essentially tying @entity22 's hands unti lthe end of his term in office			1
the @entity135 looks dimly on the idea			0
deputy press secretary @entity269 told reporters on feb. 12 aboard @entity271 that ' our position is that the continued operation of @entity5 , the facility there , weakens our national security , and ( it ) must be closed			0
' ' we believe this bill puts more constraints on a process that should be actually working faster			0
and so we oppose this legislation , and the president would veto it			0

new figures from the @entity1 show 116 former @entity24 detainees have returned to terrorism
president @entity22 vowed as soon as he was inaugurated in 2009 that he would close the military detention center
' @entity292 ' numbers make it seem like @entity22 's releases have been better - behaved than @entity11 's
' these guys do n't rejoin @entity80 overnight , ' warns a military intelligence *expert*
