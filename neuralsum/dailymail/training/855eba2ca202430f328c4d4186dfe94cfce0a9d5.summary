former @entity1 president @entity0 has sparked outrage after he gave a television interview in which he appeared to justify elements of apartheid			1
the @entity7 laureate , 76 , faced widespread condemnation this morning after he told the @entity10 news network @entity9 he believed there was merit in the idea of different ethnic groups living apart			1
mr @entity15 told @entity9 that the idea of ethnic communities being separated , as under apartheid , was ' not repugnant '			1
@entity0 spoke on @entity9 , saying the idea of separated ethnic communities was not repugnant he added that black people were not deprived of power under the apartheid regime , saying : ' they were not disenfranchised , they voted ' @entity0 and @entity24 addressing crowds after @entity24 's inauguration in 1994 the former president served as @entity1 's last white leader before the advent of democracy in 1994 , and served as deputy president under @entity24 until 1996			1
he was asked by @entity9 reporter @entity32 whether he believed apartheid had been morally repugnant			1
he answered : ' in as much as it trampled human rights it was and remains morally indefensible			2
' i have made the most profound apology in front of the @entity39 and on other occasions about the injustices which were wrought by apartheid			2
' but he added : ' what i have n't apologised for is the original concept of seeking to bring justice to all @entity1 through the concept of nation states			1
' in @entity1 it failed			1
by the end of the 70s we had to realise , and accept and admit to ourselves that it had failed			2
and that is when fundamental reform started			2
' mr @entity15 made his remarks as he spoke to @entity9 in @entity57 , where he has been attending a summit of @entity60 laureates			0
the statesman was awarded the peace prize jointly with @entity24 in 1993 after the pair negotiated a peaceful end to apartheid			1
mr @entity15 's @entity66 had previously controlled a white minority government in @entity1 from 1948 to 1994			1
former @entity1 presidents @entity24 , left , and @entity0 , right , pose with their @entity7 in @entity69 in 1993 the party brought in a series of draconian laws which formalised a system of apartheid in which racial groups were forced to live apart			1
by the late 1950s the apartheid government had developed its policy to include the creation of ' homelands ' for the black population			1
the supposedly - autonomous states , which received little international recognition , comprised less than 15 per cent of @entity1 's land but were designed to house around 80 percent of its people			1
the policy was greeted with mass protest by the country 's majority black population , who were denied the vote and forced to obtain permits to visit or work in white areas			1
in his interview with @entity9 mr @entity15 said he had initially believed in the concept of apartheid			2
he said : ' there is this picture that apartheid used to be compared to @entity101			2
@entity15 , right , meeting former prime minister @entity102 at @entity103 in 1992 ' it 's wrong , and on that , i do n't apologise for saying that what drove me as a young man , before i decided we need to embrace a new vision , was a quest to bring justice for black @entity1 in a way which would not - that 's what i believed then - destroy the justice to which my people were entitled			1
' he added : ' that 's how i was brought up			0
and it was in an era when also in @entity10 and elsewhere , and across the continent of @entity1 , there was still not this realisation that we are trampling upon the human rights of people			1
so i 'm a convert			0
' when he was asked a second time whether he believed the policy had been morally wrong , he said : ' i can only say in a qualified way			0
' inasmuch as it trampled human right , it was - and remains - and that i 've said also publicly , morally reprehensible			0
' but the concept of giving as the @entity137 have it and the @entity139 have it , of saying that ethnic unities with one culture , with one language , can be happy and can fulfil their democratic aspirations in an own state , that is not repugnant			1
' they were not put in homelands , the homelands were historically there			0
at that stage the goal was separate but equal , but separate but equal failed			0
' mr @entity15 's comments today sparked a wave of outrage in @entity154 former president was the top trending term on @entity156 as thousands posted remarks condemning his views			1
many called for the retired statesman to return his @entity60 peace prize in light of his apparent unwillingness to accept apartheid was wrong			2
one tweeter , @entity165 , wrote : ' you see what forgiveness gets you			0
' journalist @entity169 added : ' i suppose @entity15 played a role in ' ending ' @entity172 in the same way a hostage taker plays a role in " releasing " his hostage			0
' another person wrote on @entity156 : ' @entity0 remains a bitter apartheid apologist and defender			1
ca n't say i am shocked			0
' @entity180 added : ' @entity183 what have you done			0
now you 're helping create a new breed of young racists who were born in a democracy			0
2 steps back for all			0
' mr @entity15 stepped down from public life following mr @entity24 's election as president in 1994			1
the former statesman now lives in @entity193 and conducts work through the @entity195			0
his spokesman @entity196 today said the retired statesman had not intended to cause offence			0
he said : ' what he was trying to say was that the @entity200 was an artificial creation			0
' if you have an artificial creation you can go two ways - either by going your separate ways like in the @entity206 or in what is being suggested for @entity208 and @entity209 , or by trying to build a multicultural society			0
' mr @entity15 was saying that as a young man they tried to go for the first option in @entity1			2
' they changed course when they realised it was not working			0
' he added : ' it is not immoral for the @entity220 to want to rule themselves any more than it is for the @entity208 or the @entity222 to wish for the same things			0
' mr @entity15 meant no offence by his comments and the response is unjustified			2
' it is a nonsense to suggest he should return his peace prize			0
' in fact @entity1 is now a constitutional democracy whose citizens have rights which were created through the negotiations that he himself set in motion			2

@entity0 says the idea of apartheid ethnic separation was ' not repugnant '
last white president of @entity1 denies that black people were disenfranchised under apartheid regime
he won @entity7 with @entity24 in 1993
his comments have *provoked* anger from @entity1 community
