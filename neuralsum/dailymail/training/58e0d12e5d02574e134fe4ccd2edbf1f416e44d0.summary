by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:40 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 06:21 est , 8 november 2013 the water watchdog today blocked a huge eight per cent rise in @entity6 bills , telling the firm its demands for more money from customers was not justified			1
@entity11 flexed its regulatory muscle to block the increase , insisting an already - agreed rise of 1.4 per cent above inflation was sufficient			1
and as it urged companies to consider even freezing bills , comparisons were made with energy regulator @entity21 which is powerless to stop gas and electricity price hikes of up to 10 per cent			1
vetoed : @entity6 wanted to impose an extra increase on bills of eight per cent , but regulator @entity11 said there was no evidence it was necessary @entity6 applied to @entity11 in august to impose the larger than expected increase , which would add £ 29 to bills in 2014 - 15			1
the regulator ordered the firm to prove why the extra money was needed at a time when families are feeling the pinch , but it failed to do so			1
@entity11 's chief regulation officer @entity36 said : ' we said we would challenge @entity39 ' application , in the interests of customers			0
' we did just that and on the evidence provided we are not convinced that an extra bill increase is justified			0
' @entity6 could now launch an appeal against the decision			0
if unchallenged , @entity39 could still increase bills by 1.5 per cent above inflation from next april			0
costs : the @entity50 is to rush out action to limit water bill rises in an attempt to take back control of political debate over the cost of living water regulator @entity11 sets price rises for water firms every five years			1
in 2009 it agreed annual rises with all firms for 2010 - 15			2
if a firm wants to go beyond those rises , as @entity6 wanted to , @entity11 has the power to block it			1
however , the energy industry is less tightly - regulated			0
gas and electricity firms can hike bills by as much as they like , with @entity21 powerless to intervene			2
in part this is because customers are able to switch suppliers , which they can not do with water			0
@entity21 said it ' does not control the prices customers pay – this is down to energy suppliers '			0
' we regulate the prices energy companies charge for transporting energy to your home through pipes and wires , ' a spokesman added			0
' @entity21 is working to make retail market competition more effective by introducing a range of reforms to make it easier for consumers to engage in the energy market			0
' as well as reforms to create a level playing field so small suppliers can compete more effectively in the market			0
' it is a sign that @entity11 is preparing to go to battle with water firms ahead of the next round of negotiations over price rises for 2015 - 20 which start next month			1
the government has ordered @entity11 to ‘ get under the skin ’ of suppliers to ensure bills are not increased simply to maximise profits			1
@entity39 had argued that since the planned rise was agreed in 2009 the company had ' experienced changes to certain specific costs that were not taken account of by @entity11 ' at the time			2
earlier this week water companies were urged by ministers to scrap planned hikes in bills to ease the pressure on family finances			2
the coalition has been under fire for their failure to prevent major rises in gas and electricity bills this winter by the @entity124 firms who hiked prices by an average of 9.1 per cent			2
however , unlike the water industry @entity21 does not have the power to block big rises in energy bills			1
environment secretary @entity132 has asked the industry to try to reduce costs – and will promise bill payers a ‘ fair deal ’ by writing to the companies to stress ‘ the tough times that households are facing and the crucial role that the industry can play to bring costs down ’			2
household water bills are set by regulator @entity11 , and increased by 3.5 per cent for this year – or £ 13 – to an average of £ 388 beginning in april			1
water firms are more heavily regulated than the energy industry , but @entity11 also believes costs could be reduced over the next five years to reflect efficiency savings and the low cost of borrowing			1
mr @entity132 said : ‘ we know that household budgets are under pressure , and keeping water bills affordable is a crucial way we can help hardworking people			2
that is why we are pressing hard to make sure customers get a fair deal			0
’ firms will be ‘ encouraged ’ to review planned price increases , and introduce more discounts for vulnerable customers known as ‘ social tariffs ’ – although this will remain voluntary			0
this and other measures are expected to help cut the soaring burden of bad debt - when people can not pay their bills and they are saddled onto other customers to the tune of £ 15 - £ 20 per household			2
@entity11 set guidelines for prices five years in advance and then tweaks them when inflation figures are published in november			0
they believe the next price review for 2015 to 2020 which is published next year could reduce bills by up to £ 750 million a year - or around £ 30 per household			1
plea : environment secretary @entity132 asked the industry to try to reduce costs water minister @entity184 said @entity11 is the ‘ key player ’ in driving down water bills			1
he said that as long as investment was not jeopardised ‘ we do n't want to see bills going up unnecessarily ’			0
‘ that is now a matter for @entity11 to get under the skin of all the companies , ’ he told the @entity190			0
@entity36 , chief regulation officer at @entity11 said last week that there are ‘ real opportunities ’ for companies to reduce bills partly due to low interest rates			1
she said any company that will not be reducing them should provide ‘ clear evidence that this is backed by its customers ’			0
it refused an application from @entity6 which supplies 8million customers in @entity207 , to increase bills by 8 per cent this year			0
in september , @entity210 water bills were on the cards to reduce the ‘ burden on families ’ as well as energy bills , the cost of housing , transport and fees for financial services			1
but @entity221 ’s environment spokeswoman @entity220 said @entity223 households face some of the highest water bills in @entity225 - and two million now spend more than 5pc of their income on water			1
water @entity223 , representing the suppliers , said they were already working on social tariffs and tackling bad debt , while efficiency savings have saved customers around £ 120 .			0

@entity11 says firm did not provide prove that £ 29 hike was needed
signs of regulator flexing muscle ahead of talks for price rises for 2015 - 20
this week ministers wrote to water firms to ask them to reduce costs
government *desperate* to get on the front foot after energy bills row
water bills rose by average of 3.5 **%** this year but wages are up by only 1 **%**
