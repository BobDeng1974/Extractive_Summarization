she might be one of the world 's longest serving heads of state but it seems that not even the @entity4 is exempt from getting stuck in a traffic jam			1
the 88 - year - old monarch was en route to a reception at @entity9 in @entity10 , when her official @entity11 got stuck in the notoriously heavy traffic in @entity14			1
luckily for the @entity4 , who was travelling with the @entity16 , her driver managed to extricate the car and get her to the event on schedule			1
resplendent in a turquoise tweed coat and a matching dress and hat , the @entity4 appeared none the worse for her lengthy journey and beamed broadly as she spied a pair of @entity39 [ @entity39 ] waiting for her outside			2
accompanied by the @entity16 , her majesty was then ushered indoors , where she was presented with a ceremonial set of keys			2
made from gold , silver and nickel , they are an updated version of the set presented to @entity49 , who opened the building shortly after it was completed in 1925			0
afterwards , the @entity4 and prince @entity16 were given a tour of the newly refurbished building and were introduced to @entity54 staff			2
the @entity4 was also presented with a pair of posies by eight - year - old @entity57 and her sister @entity58 , five , the daughters of @entity61 consul - general , @entity60			1
not impressed : sitting in the front seat of the car , the @entity4 's protection officer looked glum big arrival : after the car was extricated from the jam , it eventually pulled up outside @entity9 none the worse : when the royal couple emerged , they looked none the worse for the experience of particular interest to her majesty was the atrium , which has been renamed in her honour and features @entity61 hemlock cladding and a swathe of red oak flooring			1
the atrium , although the newest addition to the list , is by no means the only place named after the monarch			0
in @entity9 alone , no fewer than 62 schools , roads , hospitals and parks are named after @entity4 , among them an observatory , an island chain and two different mountain ranges			2
elsewhere , the list of places named after the @entity4 includes a city in @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity99 @entity98 and @entity100 , which is famous for its beauty and tree - climbing lions , in @entity103			0
we 're here ! the @entity4 and the @entity16 are all smiles as they walk up the red carpet warm welcome : the @entity4 and the @entity16 got a warm welcome from @entity54 staff shake on it : prince @entity16 shakes hands with @entity61 high commissioner @entity112 ( left ) all smiles : the @entity4 looked cheerful and wore a pretty turquoise tweed coat and a matching hat friendly chat : the @entity4 chats to artist @entity117 from @entity118 and @entity119 in @entity120 while the new atrium is n't on quite the same scale , the @entity4 certainly appeared to enjoy the visit and looked animated as she spoke to the construction team behind it			1
before she and the @entity16 braved the traffic for a second time on their way home , @entity4 found time to unveil a plaque and add her name to the visitors book			2
' we are honoured that her majesty and @entity133 were able to join us to celebrate the opening of a high commission that is very dear to @entity61 and that reflects the depth of our friendship with the @entity97 , ' said high commissioner @entity112 afterwards			0
' it is our pleasure to name such a distinctly @entity61 feature of this building in her majesty ’s honour			0
nice view ! the @entity4 inspects the view from one of the windows at the newly refurbished @entity9 is that for me ? the @entity4 accepts posies from eight - year - old @entity57 and her sister @entity58 , five @entity154 done ! the two little girls then showed her majesty their very best curtsies , much to her delight big day : the two little girls completed their task with aplomb , watched by their mother @entity60 lovely : the @entity4 prepares to return to her car , clutching the two very pretty posies ' @entity9 serves as our country ’s front door to the @entity97			1
this revitalisation project offered us an ideal opportunity to bring the best of @entity9 straight to the heart of one of the world ’s great cities			0
' today 's visit comes towards the end of a busy week for the @entity4 , who has spent much of it conducting official business at @entity178			0
much has focused on her diplomatic work , with the @entity4 receiving new ambassadors from @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , as well as entertaining @entity185 president , @entity184 , who is making an official visit to the @entity97			0
she also attended a reception held to mark the 80th birthday of @entity189 at @entity190 on tuesday evening			0
royal salute : the @entity39 gave her majesty a sharp salute as she made her way out job done : during the visit , the @entity4 saw the new queen elizabeth ii atrium and unveiled a plaque traditional : the @entity4 was greeted by a pair of @entity9 's iconic @entity39 [ @entity39 ] unexpected treat : the @entity4 's appearance in @entity14 was greeted with delight by tourists			1
