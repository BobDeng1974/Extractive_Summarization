by @entity0 spiders disguise themselves as innocuous - looking ladybirds , tree stumps and many more natural objects in order to avoid being eaten			1
but there is one that mimics something much more disgusting			0
the @entity11 ginnaga decorates its web with a spiral pattern and pieces of dead leaves to make its nest look like bird droppings , in a bid to confuse predators			1
although scientists have known about this practice for some time , researchers have only just discovered the reasons why the spider chooses this particular disguise			0
scientists have identified a spider called @entity27 that disguises itself as bird droppings to evade predators hunting in forests of @entity31 - and even weaves its web in a way that looks like white bird droppings ( pictured ) @entity34 is a species of spider found in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40			1
spiders in the genus @entity11 spin elaborate webs in concentric circles and add debris , such as plant material , prey carcasses and twigs to disguise them from predators , and to sometimes attract dinner			2
@entity34 uses dead leaves and silk to make a white blob on its webs that looks like a bird dropping			0
because it has a silvery body , the spider is well disguised from predators such as wasps			0
the disguise is effective as it helps the creature catch food , while evading becoming dinner itself , according to researchers from @entity66 and the @entity67 in @entity37			1
it creates a white disc on its web that functions to attract prey , but because the spider has a silver body , this also makes it inconspicuous to predatory wasps			1
‘ to the human eye , the size , colour and shape of the body against its decoration resemble bird droppings , and it has been hypothesised that these spiders masquerade as bird droppings to avoid predation , ’ according to the study published in @entity85			0
the scientists showed that the spiders and their web ornaments look almost identical to bird droppings , both in colour and in size , when viewed under conditions that replicate how wasps see them			1
the disguise is particularly effective as it helps the creature catch food , while evading becoming dinner itself			0
researchers studied how both the spiders and their webs ( pictured second and fourth row ) , as well as bird droppings on leaves ( top row and third row ) appear to wasps , which eat @entity11 ginnaga they collected 10 of the spiders and used a spectrometer to measure the wavelengths of light emitted by the spider ’s bodies , their webs and bird droppings against a forest backdrop , @entity106 reported			2
a computer program was used that mimics the sensory eye cells of bees , enabling the team to see whether wasps - which have similar eye to bees - could distinguish between a potential meal and a dropping			2
in another experiment , they set up video cameras in front of 12 spider webs and covered some of the spiders ’ bodies with black ink and hid web decorations of others , while leaving a handful untouched			1
they found that wasp attacks were far greater on spiders that had either their webs or bodies blackened with carbon powder or ink , than those remained sliver and had their webs intact			0
‘ we provide empirical evidence for the first time that bird dropping masquerading can effectively reduce the predation risk of an organism , ’ ecologist i - @entity145 of @entity66 said			2
other spiders in the genus @entity11 decorate their webs - sometimes with plant material and the bodies of prey , as well as weaving thick circles			0
one particular species even makes a decoy spider to baffle predators			0
the scientists showed that the spiders and their web ornaments ( pictured top ) look almost identical to bird droppings ( pictured bottom ) , both in colour and in size , when viewed under conditions that replicate how wasps see them the spiders create a white disc on its web ( pictured ) that functions to attract prey , but because the spider has a silver body , this also makes it inconspicuous to predatory wasps			1

*cyclosa* ginnaga is silver - coloured and weaves white spirals on its web
the spiders blend in with the faux *faeces* in the forests of @entity31
this *protects* the spiders from predators such as wasps
decorations added to the spirals are also used to confuse these predators
scientists from @entity66 and the @entity67 used computer programmes and ink to make the discovery
