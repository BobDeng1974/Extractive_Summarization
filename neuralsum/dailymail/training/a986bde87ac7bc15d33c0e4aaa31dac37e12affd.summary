by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 16:30 est , 4 august 2013 the @entity1 of fashion is how to dress the bigger , older woman without making her feel patronised , ripped off or marginalised			1
clothing tags at plus - size shop @entity7 show if the style will suit an apple or pear shape , and the brand hired trendy design duo @entity13 to create a collection , where the designers broke all the ‘ big girl rules ’ by using patterns , stripes and showing bare flesh			1
@entity20 is also making an attempt with its new lines for bigger women , which use a more accurate mannequin , better fabrics , and seams , darts and waistbands			2
into the fray comes @entity31 , the online retailer , which caters for the plus - size and over- 35 woman who loves fashion			1
@entity36 brocade jacket , £ 79 , lace top , £ 40 , maroon jeans , £ 40 , gold snakeskin shoes , £ 35 and of all the brands , i would wager it has done its homework			1
so , could this be the label to change the way larger women shop for ever ? i went to view its autumn / winter range at its lab in @entity50 , where @entity51 employs ten buyers , five fabric technologists and six ‘ shapeologists ’			0
i met one such shapeologist , @entity55 , who says her role is about being a ‘ creative planner ’			0
if , like me , you do n’t know what that means , she can enlighten us : ‘ it ’s my job to empathise and understand what goes on in a woman ’s head — how she thinks and feels about her looks and body , and how confident she is			1
’ she does this by listening to women			0
and she has listened to a lot — 1,500 of them from size 12 ( which is where @entity75 starts ) to a size 32 , aged 40 to 70			1
so what did @entity31 find out ? a whopping 77 per cent want to hide their stomachs			1
nearly half struggle to find clothes that suit their shape			0
more than 79 per cent want to hide their flaws , while 81 per cent want to enhance their best bits ( i ca n’t think why this was n’t 100 per cent for both )			0
most of them get style help from their daughters , a huge number avoid social outings because they have nothing to wear , and most are repelled by negative language in advertising — words such as ‘ repair ’ and ‘ fix ’			0
finally , the brand found that as we get older we are less obsessed with size and more interested in our shape			1
floral dress with inbuilt @entity110 , £ 65 , gold snakeskin shoes , as before leopard print coat , £ 130 , lace top , as before , black tuxedo trousers , £ 35 , court shoes , as before @entity51 has used fabric technology to ensure every garment has some sort of hidden panelling and support , as well as clever colour blocking ( think @entity123 ’s famous trompe l’oeil red carpet dress ; it ’s no surprise to discover a consultant on the brand is stylist @entity127 , who dresses @entity128 ) to give its wearer a waist			1
best of all , it has a bespoke service , so if you happen to be top heavy , say , you can have a dress adjusted to suit			0
all this , plus wide - fit boots and shoes , and lingerie with bras that go up to an l — the biggest cup size available in the @entity140			1
but what of the new , cutting - edge autumn / winter collection ? it is all monochrome , which apparently is what bigger women want			1
there are sleeves , lace panels , and secret support for tummies and buttocks , even in a very floaty floral dress , at just £ 50			0
there is a great pencil skirt with a patterned panel that really does slim the hips , at £ 35 , and a bodycon illusion dress , £ 45			1
red coat , £ 49 , @entity160 panel skirt , £ 35 , white lace top , £ 40 , heels , £ 30 there is a lovely pink pea coat , £ 55 , that i prefer to the more tweedy coats , which i imagine big women will think makes them look even chunkier			1
similarly , a poncho - style sweater would , i think , make a larger women feel like a house			1
shirts , at £ 25 to £ 35 , cleverly do n’t gape at the bust , and the sleeves are neither too narrow nor too voluminous			2
fabrics are n’t natural or top notch , but you do need @entity177 or @entity177 to hold bits and bobs in , so i will let them off			0
my only gripe , but it ’s a big one , is that the campaign has been shot on a size 12 model			2
the brand managers say this is what shoppers want , but do we , really ? the model in the promotional video is thin			0
so we put some pieces on a model who is a size 16 , and i think they look even better			2
@entity195 dress , £ 45 , snakeskin handbag , £ 60 , heels as before grey check and dogstooth dress , £ 65 , court shoes , £ 35 , envelope clutch , £ 25 i like the stretchy tuxedo trousers — they have a stripe that ’s slimming , as is the high waist — and the metallic jacket , though i ’d have added vents to give it a kick			2
on the whole , though , shapes are a bit boxy , which meant we added bulldog clips at the back to ‘ nip ’ , and the sleeves a little too wide			0
my best buy is the faux @entity123 tote with chains , £ 55			0
i ’m assured the festive collection will be more fun , without making us look like @entity223 trees			0
let ’s hope they have the courage , having seen our photo shoot , to use a model who is truly representative			0
as one size 20 fan of the brand told me when i showed her the new looks : ‘ we need proper chunky			2
’ styling : @entity237 : l + @entity238 and make - up : @entity240 assistant : @entity242 : @entity243 at milk			2
