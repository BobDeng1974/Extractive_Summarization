could @entity0 be coming to an end ? the popular sketch comedy program is in its 40th season this year , and ahead of the show 's highly anticipated special on february 15 to mark the occasion , creator @entity4 is sharing who his favorite cast members have been , the a-list actors who auditioned for roles and he turned down and what the future holds for his show			1
this as he suggests that when he steps down from his post , it may be the end for the show			2
i 'm going to keep doing it as long as i possibly can because i love it and because it 's what i do			0
' he then added ; ' but there is more niche stuff [ now ]			0
@entity35 doing @entity36 and giving it 10 minutes in a 90 - minute show was a big deal , but @entity41 and @entity42 , none of that existed then			2
' then he did something he seldom does in interviews , and revealed some of the young talent he passed on who would go on to become huge stars			2
' @entity52 and @entity53 there were lots of people who you 'd see how brilliant they were , but you knew on some level that it was n't going to work			1
' the same goes for @entity59 , who he said came at a time where there were already two similar women on the program , @entity65 and @entity66			2
there is one star whoever who seems so perfect for the show , it is almost unfathomable that they passed			0
' i was n't at the @entity74 audition , but somebody who was there said , ' i do n't think @entity4 would like it , ' and they were probably wrong , but it does n't matter. , ' explained @entity4			1
' or maybe they were right — who knows ? no one gets it all right			0
' among the a-list stars who auditioned and were not cast on the show are @entity52 and @entity53 ( above ) @entity59 ( left ) was turned down because there were already two similar women on the show , will it was felt by one of the casting directors that @entity4 would not like @entity74 ( right ) after his audition as for his favorite cast members , it seems that @entity4 has a big soft spot for @entity96 and @entity97 , especially after the two returned to the show even after finding success in movies			1
this only helps the show he explained , but also endears them to their fans			0
' they also have a pact with the people who watch the show : they were there , they loved you at the beginning , they told everyone else about you and they showed up for everything you did , ' he explained			0
' so you have to make sure that you honor that			0
' and if @entity4 does step down soon , there is one name almost everyone has talked about running the show - @entity20			1
the former head writer for the show , who still turns up at least once a season , has been asked about this in the past , and said ; ' i feel like @entity0 is so defined by @entity4 's taste and his sensibility			1
he is the center of that show , and i think it should just — when he wants to stop , it should just stop			0
' @entity4 has won emmys and @entity133 for his shows , and created @entity0 when he was just 30 as for the anniversary special , the lineup of past talent that will perform is remarkable , and includes , in addition to @entity20 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity21 , @entity97 , @entity142 , @entity20 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity96 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity152			1
and those are just the former cast members			2
among the former hosts stopping by are ; @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity74 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , and @entity171			1
and last , but certainly not least , even @entity173 herself will be there .			0
