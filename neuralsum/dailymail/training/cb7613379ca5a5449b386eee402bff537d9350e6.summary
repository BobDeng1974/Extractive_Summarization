at last night ’s @entity1 , there were many moments of cheering , chanting , and caterwauling			2
but one speech – made by former @entity6 governor @entity5 – seemed wholly bizarre , and was full of fist pumps , extreme facial expressions , and screaming			1
in her fiery address , mrs @entity5 attacked @entity12 ’s handling of the auto industry crisis while praising president @entity15 ’s bailout , all while wildly gesturing			1
she spoke of the hundreds of devastated workers who were hit hard by @entity45 ’s decision to close one of its largest plants in @entity48 , @entity6 , and how many workers came up to her asking why this happened , as they were all hard - working and loyal to the company			2
the two - term governor said : ‘ the entire auto industry , and the lives of over one million hard - working @entity34 , teetered on the edge of collapse ; and with it , the whole manufacturing sector of this country			1
we looked everywhere for help			0
‘ almost nobody had the guts to help us – not the banks , not the private investors and not @entity68 , ’ she said , referring to mr @entity12 ’s op - ed appearing in the @entity62 entitled ‘ @entity63			0
’ the audience applauded , and the former governor continued , raising her voice and throwing her hands in the air , saying : ‘ but , in 2009 , the cavalry arrived : our new president , @entity15 … he made the tough calls and he saved the @entity34 auto industry ! ’ the delegates in @entity22 , @entity79 began cheering uproariously , and maintained their energy throughout mrs @entity5 ’s six - and - a - half minute speech			1
standing o : at many points in her six - and - a - half minute speech , she brought the delegates to their feet high flying adored : with a vast array of gesturing , the @entity88 - born @entity34 politician and tv host brought delegates in @entity22 to their feet cheering and clapping broadcast : she was projected out on the @entity1 monitors so every delegate could see her speech but it was n’t just mr @entity12 ’s stance on the auto industry she attacked			1
mrs @entity5 went on to question the @entity103 presidential candidate ’s wealth			0
‘ how did he make that fortune ? ’ she asked , ‘ and at whose expense ? ' @entity34 , let 's rev our engines ! in your car and on your ballot , the " @entity118 " is for drive forward , and the " @entity117 " is for reverse – and in this election , we 're driving forward , not back ! ' ‘ you know , too often he made it at the expense of middle - class @entity34			2
year after year it was profits before people			0
’ mr @entity15 , she said , saved more than one million @entity34 jobs with his bailout for the auto industry			1
but the most intense moment in her speech came when she again attacked mr @entity12 , saying : ‘ sure , @entity12 loves our lakes and trees			2
' he loves our cars so much , they have their own elevator			0
but the people who design , build , and sell those cars ? well , in @entity12 's world , the cars get the elevator ; the workers get the shaft ! ’ at this point in the speech , she had to pause because she was drowned out by chants and cheers of ‘ @entity34 , @entity34			1
’ nominated : president @entity15 , right , and first lady @entity153 walk across the stage with their daughter @entity155 , left , after president @entity15 's speech she concluded with several gestures : ‘ @entity34 , let ’s rev our engines ! in your car and on your ballot , the “ @entity118 ” is for drive forward , and the “ @entity117 ” is for reverse – and in this election , we ’re driving forward , not back ! let ’s re-elect our great president , @entity15 ! ’ @entity171 ’s @entity170 said it was ‘ by far the most energetic and well - received of any ( speech ) so far this evening while @entity173 wrote : ‘ her performance may be best summed up by a tweet : i ’ll have what she ’s having ! ! ! ! ’ @entity179 critiqued : ‘ @entity5 ’s wild gestures and energy level – which hovered between fired up and thermonuclear … - left the crowd delirious			1
’ however , not everyone was as wowed by the speech			0
@entity186 , linking to a @entity188 video of her speech , called it a ‘ podium meltdown			0
’ the @entity88 - born @entity34 politician serves as host for a prime time show on @entity197 , the network created by former vice president and presidential candidate @entity200 , and is a columnist for @entity171 .			0

two - term @entity6 governor delivered energetic speech to @entity1
was filled with fist - pumps , *thumbs* up , and theatrical facial expressions
attacked @entity12 's response to @entity211 bailout but praised @entity15 for saving one million jobs in industry
was drowned out by cheers and chants of ' @entity34 , @entity34 ! '
