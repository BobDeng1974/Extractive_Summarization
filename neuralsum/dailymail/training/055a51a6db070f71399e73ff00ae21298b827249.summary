she admits she used to get through bags of @entity3 sweets while filming @entity4 and has even pinched chocolate from her children			0
so tv presenter @entity8 was perfectly placed to get on the sugar - free diet bandwagon , with a cookbook detailing how she eventually weaned herself off the sweet stuff			1
but her book , @entity8 ’s 5 weeks to @entity13 , has left readers feeling bitter after several of its recipes were found to be just as sweet as regular treats			1
reviews on the @entity28 website criticised the title as ‘ hugely misleading ’ with some buyers demanding their money back			0
experts at the @entity33 said some of the recipes would warrant a high or a moderate sugar label if they were sold in supermarkets			1
in the book @entity39 , 47 , advises readers to replace table sugar with honey and maple syrup			2
she also suggests reducing these over five weeks			0
one disgruntled buyer wrote on @entity28 : ‘ sorry @entity8 , this is hugely misleading			2
i am returning this book today			0
’ @entity46 , of the @entity33 , said : ‘ some of these recipes are not sugar - free or even low in sugar			0
miss @entity8 ’s spokesman said : ‘ as the title suggests , five weeks to @entity13 offers a 5 week programme to eliminate refined and processed sugar from your diet			1
' the book does not claim to only offer sugar free recipes , as the programme is a weaning exercise and as such it includes some recipes that contain natural sugars .			2

@entity8 **'s** cookbook details how she weaned herself off sugar
but @entity8 **'s** 5 weeks to @entity13 contains recipes packed full of sugar
diet experts said it comes in the form of natural ingredients such as honey
