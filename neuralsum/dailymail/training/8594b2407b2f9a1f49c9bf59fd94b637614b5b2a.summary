@entity0 cruised to victory in their @entity2 clash thanks to @entity5 's hat - trick and a double from @entity7			1
@entity9 's @entity8 picks out the key points at @entity11			1
@entity2 winners will reach the @entity13 , but @entity14 still mixes it up			2
he 's made on average 8.4 changes for each @entity17 tie ; last season they made 6.4			0
@entity5 marked his return to the @entity0 side with a hat - trick at @entity11 the @entity24 boss has made 42 changes in their five @entity17 games so far this term , but he has n't necessarily picked weaker teams			1
on thursday night he brought in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity5 and @entity33 after the 4 - 1 defeat to @entity35 , six players with 197 international caps between them			1
@entity32 was restored to the starting xi following saturday 's 4 - 1 defeat at @entity35 asteras are the @entity41 of @entity42			1
why ? rising through their national system at the same blistering pace , they won the fourth division in 2005 , the same year @entity43 were promoted to @entity47			0
spurs marked the 10th anniversary of @entity51 's passing with a commemorative programme celebrating the legendary manager 's life			0
a memento for fans of that era , and the kids who gained entry for a fiver ( £ 1.50 more than the programme			0
) @entity51 had a 36 - year association with @entity0 as a player and then manager despite the reduced prices ( £ 25 adults , £ 5 juniors ) , there were plenty of empty seats at @entity11			1
@entity70 considering each @entity2 game is arguably more important to @entity0 than their top flight encounters			2
there were plenty of empty seats for @entity0 's @entity2 clash @entity76 fans made some noise in north @entity78 recently , and despite the small @entity42 support , @entity80 fans were typically boisterous , congregating to give their heroes an ovation 55 minutes before kick - off			2
@entity80 fans gave their players a good reception before kick - off ' right now , the league table is n't crucial to us , ' said @entity14 in his programme notes			2
well , @entity14 , points make prizes , and @entity0 have n't had this bad a start since @entity95 was sacked in 2008			0
@entity14 insists he 's not concerned by @entity0 's poor start to the season bizarrely , @entity98 had seven @entity24 in thursday night 's squad , all in that perfect age of 24 to 29			0
wealthy owners @entity101 and @entity103 believe the key is @entity105 at their peak , and who could blame them ? forward @entity108 was among seven @entity24 in @entity80 's matchday squad			0

@entity5 marks his return to the side with well - taken treble
*striker* ended the game in goal after @entity118 was sent - off
