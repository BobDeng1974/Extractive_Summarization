the great - niece of @entity1 has come out in support of @entity3 after the actress 's controversial remarks calling the icon ' anti-semitic ' and a ' gender bigot			1
' @entity8 , 54 , an activist and filmmaker , took to @entity10 to address @entity3 's indictment of @entity1 during her @entity13 presentation on january 7			1
ultimately , wrote @entity1 , although she has ' mixed feelings ' about @entity1 , she ' loved ' @entity3 's comments about her illustrious relative			1
@entity1 descendant : @entity8 says her great - uncle was , as @entity3 says , sexist , racist and anti-semitic @entity20 remarks : actress @entity3 called @entity1 a ' gender bigot ' and ' anti-semitic ' in her speech on tuesday			1
but she also praised her friend and fellow actress , @entity25 , as a ' beautiful artist ' @entity3 attended the @entity13 dinner to pay homage to fellow actress @entity25 for her portrayal of @entity31 ' creator @entity30 in the @entity1 film saving mr @entity33			1
but in between her praise of @entity25 , she managed to include a few scathing comments about @entity1 , whom she called a ‘ hideous anti-semite ’ who ‘ formed and supported an anti-semitic industry lobby			1
and he was certainly , on the evidence of his company ’s policies , a gender bigot ’			1
@entity3 read a letter that his company wrote in 1938 to an aspiring female animator			2
it included the line , ‘ women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen , as that task is performed entirely by young men			0
’ ‘ some of his associates reported that @entity1 did n’t really like women , ’ @entity3 said , quoting esteemed animator @entity60 on his old boss : ‘ he did n’t trust women or cats			1
’ legacy : his grandniece says that @entity1 ( pictured in 1951 ) was a visionary who has made billions of people happy with his work last friday , @entity8 wrote about @entity3 's speech on her @entity10 page			1
' i had n't heard a word about this @entity3 / @entity1 flap till this morning			1
funny how no one mentioned it to me ...			0
like i was living in some kind of information bubble and nobody wanted to hurt my feelings or something			0
but if anyone is going to have mixed feelings about a cultural icon , would n't it be a member of the family ? ? ? more than anyone else ? ? ? ' she wrote , reports the @entity90			0
' and if you are going to have mixed feelings about a family member ( and we all do ) take it from me , you really need to be as honest as possible about those feelings , or else you are going to lead yourself into many a blind alley in life ! ! ' she went on to agree with @entity3 's accusations of racism and sexism			1
misogynist ? of course ! ! racist ? c'mon he made a film ( @entity107 ) about how you should stay ' with your own kind ' at the height of the fight over segregation ! as if the ' @entity114 ' number was n't proof enough ! ! how much more information do you need ? ' @entity3 branded @entity1 a misogynist in her speech and rumors have long swirled about his anti-semitic leanings and the racial stereotypes in his early films			1
so what are the charges laid against @entity1 - and are they true ? the charge : @entity1 was @entity127 's films from the 1930s and ' 40s - particularly ' @entity129 ' - are full of offensive racial stereotypes			2
in one , @entity131 wears black - face , and in ' @entity135 , a half - donkey , half - black centaurette carries around a watermelon			0
however , biographer @entity137 in his 2009 book ' @entity1 : the @entity139 of the @entity140 ' concludes , ' @entity1 was no racist			2
he never , either publicly or privately , made disparaging remarks about blacks or asserted white superiority			0
like most white @entity146 of his generation , however , he was racially insensitive			0
' the charge : @entity1 was anti-semiticin 1938 , a month after the infamous @entity150 pogrom @entity151 , @entity1 welcomed @entity153 filmmaker and @entity155 propagandist @entity154 to his @entity157 studios			2
he was also associated with the very anti-semitic motion picture @entity158 says @entity1 was personally not anti-jewish			2
' there is some dispute whether the same spirit of tolerance extended to the studio , but of the @entity165 who worked there , it was hard to find any who thought @entity1 was an anti-semite , ' he writes			2
@entity165 author @entity169 points out in his book ' multiculturalism and the mouse : race and sex in @entity175 ' that @entity1 was the first filmmaker to cast a @entity165 @entity177 ( @entity178 in ' @entity179 ' ) and other @entity1 films feature @entity165 actors in a wide range of roles			0
the charge : @entity1 was @entity185 correctly pointed out , women were not permitted to do creative work at @entity1			0
and , according to @entity60 at least , @entity1 did not trust women			0
however , @entity1 was a product of his time			0
according to the @entity90 , women were confined to inking and painting in animation during the 1930s at all the major studios			0
@entity195 became @entity1 ’s first female animator on 1942 ’s ' @entity197 , ' and in the ’ 40s and ’ 50s , @entity198 was art supervisor and color stylist for ' @entity201 , ' ' @entity202 , ' ' @entity203 , ' ' @entity204 ' and ' @entity205			2
' no angel : @entity207 as @entity1 and @entity25 as @entity30 in the film saving mr @entity33 @entity3 softened the blow during her speech by adding that ‘ there is a piece of received wisdom that says that the most creative people are often odd , or irritating , eccentric , damaged , difficult			1
that along with enormous creativity come certain deficits in humanity or decency			0
‘ we are familiar with this trope in our business : @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , ’ @entity3 added			2
@entity8 agreed with those sentiments too : ' but damn , he was hella good at making films and his work has made billions of people happy			2
there 's no denying it			0
mixed feelings up the wazoo			0
' documentary - maker : producer @entity8 has worked on films such as @entity239 and @entity240 ten hours later the documentary producer , who has worked on such films as the @entity239 , which was nominated for the @entity243 at @entity244 in 2012 , posted on @entity3 's comments about her great - uncle again			1
' i know he was a man of his times and i can forgive him , but saving mr @entity33 was a brazen attempt by the company to make a saint out of the man			1
a devil he was not			0
nor an angel ... so i say @entity256			0
' the film in question , saving mr @entity33 starring @entity25 as @entity30 and @entity207 as @entity1 , is about @entity1 's attempts to gain the screen rights adapt @entity31 into a film from @entity30 .			1

@entity8 , the grandniece of @entity1 , said @entity3 's comments about her relative were right
@entity3 made a speech at the @entity13 dinner last week in which she called @entity1 a ' gender bigot ' and that he had ‘ formed and supported an anti-semitic industry lobby '
she was there to honor actress @entity25 for her portrayal of @entity31 ’ creator , @entity30 in @entity1 film , saving mr @entity33
@entity8 took to @entity10 to address the comments saying that while her great - uncle was a visionary , he was also anti-semitic , racist and misogynistic
