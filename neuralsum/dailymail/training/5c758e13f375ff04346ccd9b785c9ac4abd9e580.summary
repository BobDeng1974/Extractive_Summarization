by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 i had not long been back at @entity2 when we went to @entity4 early in the season			1
i was trying to convince @entity6 i deserved to be in @entity2 ’s back four — i ’m not sure that game was the best audition ! everything went wrong			1
we knew a bit about @entity12 , but nobody saw that hat - trick coming			1
i have to take most ( if not all ) the blame for the first goal			0
i gave away a free - kick and then at the set - piece i was supposed to mark @entity19			0
opener : @entity0 gave away the free - kick that led to the first goal , and lost his marker who provided the assist i ended up too far away , made a late dive to get my head on the ball and almost got away with it but it dropped to @entity12 and from that range , he could n’t @entity29 the second was an excellent finish but the third had some good fortune about it			1
@entity12 , @entity36 and i all went for the ball but somehow it squirmed through for @entity12 to tap in			2
@entity40 were n't the force they had been but when they got their teeth into you at @entity4 , the roof lifted off the ground			0
when that third goal hit the net , the place erupted			0
not a good day at the office			0
proof : @entity0 , left , endured a torrid afternoon despite trying to prove himself to @entity6 third : @entity0 said that when the third went in ' the roof lifted off the ground ' at @entity4			2

@entity0 says he was to blame for @entity12 **'s** hat - trick
@entity12 scored three goals in less than five minutes against @entity2
@entity40 *won* the game 3 - 0
it is still the @entity62 **'s** *fastest* ever hat - trick
@entity0 said he was trying to convince @entity6 that he should start
