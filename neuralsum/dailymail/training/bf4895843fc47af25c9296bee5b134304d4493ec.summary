by @entity0 , deputy political editor claim : @entity1 has been paid more than £ 60,000 in expenses for his constituency office @entity1 was facing a probe into the @entity7 @entity6 ’s finances last night as the @entity8 announced that he has ‘ questions to answer ’ over the use of his @entity7 office			1
@entity6 supporters @entity13 and @entity14 gave a building in @entity16 called ‘ the @entity17 ’ to mr @entity1 rent - free 15 years ago			1
but the only time the @entity20 mp has listed the donation was in june 2004 when a £ 1,100 donation was filed with the election watchdog as ‘ non cash - premises ’			2
the @entity8 announced that it is writing to mr @entity1 to ask him to explain why he did not register the office as a benefit in kind every year			1
the @entity28 clearly states that ‘ the provision otherwise than on commercial terms of any property , services or facilities for the use or benefit of the party ’ counts as a donation			0
a spokesman for the @entity8 : ‘ there are a lot of questions around this			0
we ’re getting in touch with the party to seek clarification			0
‘ we would like more information because mr @entity1 is a regulated donee and so is his constituency party			1
we need to see whether donations in kind were registered in the right way			0
’ mr @entity1 also faced charges of hypocrisy yesterday as it emerged that he has claimed ‘ general expenditure allowances ’ from the @entity62 averaging £ 15,000 a year to pay for the same office – while denouncing @entity56 largesse and @entity57 who abuse @entity60 expenses			1
while mr @entity1 is not required by the @entity56 to justify where the money has gone , he has voluntarily declared how much money has been spent on the office since 2009 – a sum totalling nearly £ 70,000			1
mr @entity1 said : ‘ i ’m not defending this system , i want it to end			2
but i get given , as does every other @entity7 mep , £ 3,580 every month to spend in the @entity7 and in my constituency as i see fit			0
' we do not have to provide any receipts or any explanation for how that money is spent			0
’ asked where the money goes , he said : ‘ the electricity bill is more than £ 3,000 a year			1
’ premises : mr @entity1 claims that the converted barn near @entity79 costs him £ 1,000 a month to run expenses : the @entity6 leader claims the money as a member of the @entity62 , pictured @entity1 has previously boasted over the vast amounts of expenses he is able to claim from the @entity62			1
in 2009 , after a decade as an @entity70 , he estimated that he had claimed £ 2million in expenses - a figure which would now stand at £ 3million if it continued at the same rate			2
he has come under fire for employing his wife @entity89 as a secretary , using £ 20,000 a year in public funds			2
and this month it emerged that he uses a private company to funnel the money he is paid for media appearances , which could halve his tax bill			0
mr @entity1 has always defended his use of expenses , saying that he spends everything he claims on @entity6 's campaign to pull @entity7 out of the @entity56			1
the @entity6 leader lost his temper when asked to explain why the cost was so high for a small office measuring just 625 sq ft. the average dual fuel bill for a 1,000 sq ft home is just £ 1,200			2
questioned on @entity106 whether he was running in his office ‘ a sauna ’ or ‘ @entity109 ’ – the headquarters in the tv children ’s series @entity111 – mr @entity1 attacked the interviewer @entity112 as an ‘ establishment ’ stooge and added : ‘ we are running machines , running banks of computers , running photocopiers			1
’ however a former member of @entity6 has asked the @entity62 ’s anti-fraud office @entity121 to investigate mr @entity1 ’s use of allowances			1
an @entity121 spokesman said it had received a complaint , was considering whether it fell within its remit and whether there was sufficient evidence to launch an investigation			0
one former @entity6 member claimed last night that whistleblowers were silenced , ignored or forced out of the party after daring to question its use of @entity56 allowances and donations			2
he told @entity140 that mr @entity1 had called a senior female official a ‘ stupid woman ’ and told her to ‘ shut up ’ when she asked for an independent audit into party finances			1
another member was allegedly physically threatened			0
a spokesman for the party said : ‘ these historic allegations come from a few very unimpressive people that @entity6 attracted years ago and who were gradually weeded out			0
’ mr @entity1 could also be in hot water with @entity153 officials after admitting in a television interview yesterday that he uses allowances to travel around the @entity7 campaigning			2
his robust defence of his use of allowances provoked fury from the @entity160 , who pointed out he has called for mps who abused the @entity60 expenses system to be jailed			0
a senior @entity164 said : ‘ that is the hypocrisy of the man			0
he says he hates the @entity153 gravy train and then he boasts that he is riding it all the way			0

@entity1 claims £ 15,500 a year to run his office in @entity172 , @entity16
the building was given to him rent - free and former office manager says it cost just £ 3,000 a year to run
@entity179 official has referred @entity1 to the @entity56 's anti-fraud watchdog
party leader denies any *wrongdoing* and says allegation is a political smear
