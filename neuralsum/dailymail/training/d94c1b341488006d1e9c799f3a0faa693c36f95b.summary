the archbishop of @entity1 issued an extraordinary apology for the @entity4 bombing of @entity5 during the @entity6 the archbishop of @entity1 last night issued an extraordinary apology for the @entity4 bombing of @entity5 during the @entity6			1
in what was immediately criticised as an insult to the young men who gave their lives to defeat the @entity16 , the @entity11 @entity10 told the @entity18 people of his ‘ profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow ’ over the attack			1
his comments at a ceremony in @entity5 to mark the 70th anniversary of the bombings came amid a growing row about @entity29 coverage of the commemoration in which @entity4 was described as ‘ worse than the @entity16 ’ over the raids that killed thousands at the end of the war			1
former defence minister sir @entity34 criticised the archbishop , saying : ‘ i do not hear @entity36 apologising for the @entity37			1
’ and historian professor @entity38 said it was wrong to take a single incident in the war and say sorry for it			0
archbishop @entity10 said the bombing of @entity5 , which killed an estimated 25,000 , ‘ diminished all our humanity ’			1
but he made no reference to the 55,573 @entity4 aircrew killed in the struggle to overthrow @entity49 , nor to the @entity18 bombing of @entity51 and @entity52			1
@entity60 mp @entity59 said : ‘ these remarks do sound to me like an apology			0
for the archbishop to make an apology for our defeat of @entity49 is bizarre			2
i would have thought the last thing we should be doing is apologising			0
we should be praised for defeating @entity49			0
these words are an insult to the young men who gave their lives in the defeat of @entity18			2
’ the archbishop – whose great uncle air chief marshal sir @entity67 was one of the main architects of @entity4 ’s campaign of bombing @entity18 cities – told the congregation he thought it was ‘ miraculous ’ that they were welcoming him given the ‘ brutal and devastating ’ nature of the attack			1
‘ over three days in february allied bombers brought death and destruction on a scale and with a ferocity it is impossible to imagine , ’ he said			0
‘ much debate surrounds this most controversial raid of the allied bombing campaign			0
whatever the arguments , events here 70 years ago left a deep wound and diminished all our humanity			0
so as a follower of @entity88 i stand here among you with a profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow			0
’ archbishop of canterbury @entity10 said the bombing raids on @entity5 ( pictured ) , which killed an estimated 25,000 , ‘ diminished all our humanity ’ most rev @entity10 apologised for @entity5 ( pictured ) , but made no reference to the @entity18 bombings of @entity51 and @entity52 he praised the reconciliation of @entity98 and the growth of friendship after the war			1
the references to profound regret and deep sorrow sparked furore among veterans and conservative politicians already angered by @entity109 reports on the anniversary dominated by graphic accounts of the deaths of @entity18 victims			1
an interview with a @entity4 prisoner of war – who called the bombing of @entity5 a ‘ war crime ’ – was repeated several times			1
sir @entity34 , a @entity60 mp , said : ‘ our wartime military commanders , @entity120 , and the men of @entity122 should not be held to blame for the deaths of civilians such as those in @entity5			1
‘ that was the fault of the @entity18 people who failed to remove @entity49 and his evil regime			2
it is very unfortunate that the archbishop felt unable to pay tribute to the heroism of the @entity121 , half of whom gave their lives so that the @entity18 people could ultimately be liberated from @entity49 ’s tyranny			1
’ the archbishop was criticised by historians and former defence secretary sir @entity34 for the apology for the bombings of @entity5 ( pictured ) the archbishop said it was ‘ miraculous ’ @entity5 ( aftermath of bombing pictured ) was welcoming him given the ‘ brutal and devastating ’ nature of the attack @entity10 's comments came at a ceremony in @entity5 to mark the 70th anniversary of the bombings professor @entity38 , of @entity155 , said : ‘ @entity4 did not want to fight that war			1
‘ but once it began we were determined to win it , knowing that civilian lives would be taken			0
most people are satisfied that the @entity163 bombing campaign was not motivated by vindictiveness but was part of a strategy to bring the war to a close as quickly as possible			0
‘ @entity120 thought the bombing of @entity5 had gone too far			2
but he would never have apologised for it , never			0
’ of the @entity29 coverage , military top brass , @entity163 veterans , politicians and historians said it ignored the atrocities committed by @entity49 and the military justifications for the attack			0
sir @entity34 said that the one - sided reporting of the raid was disgraceful			1
he said : ‘ it is very unfortunate that the @entity29 chose on all days to produce such a one - sided account			0
‘ it was just as one might expect from the @entity29 , concentrating on the negatives			0
what about the civilians in @entity51 who were bombed out of their homes ? what about the bombing in the @entity37 ? ‘ to suggest that those responsible for the bombing of @entity5 were on a par with @entity49 or guilty of war crimes is an absolute disgrace			1
’ a church of @entity196 spokesman pointed to interviews following the archbishop ’s speech in which he had ‘ refused to say he was apologising ’			2
the spokesman said : ‘ any suggestion that the archbishop was apologising is manifestly false			2
the archbishop ’s comments were a reflection in a solemn ceremony on the tragedy of war			2
‘ they very carefully avoided apologising , and those present , including the president of @entity18 , recognised the difference			2
in his speech , he also recognised the fact that there is no equivalence with @entity218 war crimes and that the war started with @entity218 aggression			0
‘ in broadcast interviews immediately following his speech the archbishop refused to say he was apologising , but repeated that war is always tragedy			0
he also referred to the terrible losses in bomber command			0
mr @entity10 said it was not a question of blame and spoke of the bombing of @entity52 , @entity234 , @entity51 and other places			1
