when she moved from @entity18 to @entity19 , @entity9 and tried to change her license plate , officials feared her message ' @entity6 ' might be misinterpreted as meaning ' i love to f % * k. ' @entity23 ! : all @entity12 wanted was to share her love for tofu on her license plate but was denied by the state for being too vulgar you love to what ? ! : this is what the ' offensive ' plate might look like had it been on the back of @entity12 's car ' all i ’m trying to do is spread a pro-vegan message with my license plate , ' said @entity12 to @entity37			1
' it just seemed logical to change my license plate to something i believed in , ' she continued			0
