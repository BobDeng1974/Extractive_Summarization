you get what you pay for , so they say			1
but the @entity3 is adept at doing tailored pieces in smart fabrics			1
tv presenter @entity6 tried three top - to - toe outfits			1
could she spot the bargains from the bling ? dinner date dress , £ 20 , oasis - @entity13 necklace , £ 2.99 , and bag , £ 14.99 , newlook.co.uk ring , £ 7 , @entity17 shoes , £ 5 , everything5pounds.com total : £ 49.98 a belt would improve the overall shape of this dress , but at a smart evening event no one would know it cost the same as a posh bottle of wine			1
i ca n’t believe the shoes are only £ 5 ; they look as if they ’d be at least £ 50			1
dress , £ 650 , beulahlondon.com @entity14 , £ 3,195 , caratlondon.com ring , £ 235 , monicavinader.com bag , £ 195 , lkbennett.com shoes , £ 725 , arunaseth.com total : £ 5,000 this dress looks sweet and fits perfectly , but it does n’t feel expensive ( 75 per cent stiff cotton , 25 per cent nylon with a 100 per cent silk lining )			1
but the necklace ( set in nine - carat gold , but these are n’t diamonds ) does not look as if it ’s worth thousands			2
winner : split : i prefer the pricey dress , but the cheaper shoes and jewellery			2
out for drinks dress , £ 30 , axparis.com jacket , £ 5 , and shoes , £ 5 , everything5pounds.com @entity14 , £ 7 , and earrings , £ 3 , claires.co.uk total : £ 50 this dress may be less than a tenth of the price of the more expensive one , but i prefer it 100 per cent			1
the colour is better — it ’s a warmer golden shade rather than a silvery grey — as is the fit			2
on looks , i ’d think it was the more expensive of the two			1
the jacket is smartly tailored , worn - in looking and lightweight for spring			2
the shoes have a natty asymmetrical cut at the toe line and feel incredibly comfortable			2
@entity68 dress , £ 460 , oxygenboutique.com leather jacket , £ 1,845 , michaelkors.com @entity71 necklace , £ 1,495 , sheeva.com earrings , £ 695 , astleyclarke.com shoes , £ 505 , giuseppezanottidesign.com total : £ 5,000 this is a great dress : sexy , but the length prevents a mutton - dressed - as - lamb situation			0
the fabric feels a little viscose , though			0
the jacket is suspiciously shiny , but butter soft			0
the necklace is set with miniature white sapphires , but i would n’t have spotted this as different to the budget version			0
winner : the cheap option — it makes a better impact all round			1
shopping trip coat , £ 30 , boohoo.com @entity91 at @entity93 sweater , £ 4 , direct.asda.com shoes and jeans , £ 5 each , everything5pounds.com tote bag , £ 19.99 , hm.com necklace , £ 7.99 , daisystreet.co.uk total : £ 49.98 i love this ( admittedly thin ) coat , which looks far more costly			0
the necklace looks almost identical to the dear one			0
the jumper is a bit see - through , but the jeans fit like a glove			0
coat , £ 1,450 , aquascutum.com @entity108 silk and cashmere sweater , £ 740 , net – @entity110 @entity112 jeans , £ 300 , selfridges.com tote bag with inbuilt phone or @entity116 charger portal , £ 1,500 , aspinaloflondon.com @entity118 necklace , £ 590 , benna.co.uk shoes , £ 420 , arunaseth.com total : £ 5,000 a classy outfit			0
the jeans are soft and supple , the jumper warm , but not heavy , the coat smart if shapeless and the handbag is obviously top quality			0
but the shoes and necklace were nothing special			0
winner : the cheap option			1
with neutral colours and fail - safe cuts , i had to look hard to tell which was which .			0

the @entity3 has been *reproducing* expensive *styles* for years
@entity6 tried three outfits from the shops and three from designers
can you tell which is cheap chic and which has a weighty price tag ?
