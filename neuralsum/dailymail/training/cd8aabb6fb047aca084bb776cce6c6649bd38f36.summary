by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 13:07 est , 7 june 2013 a miracle baby has been born despite her mother suffering from kidney failure which should have made her infertile			1
@entity6 ’s mother , @entity5 , fell pregnant while she was being treated for end - stage kidney failure			1
the condition meant she should not have been able to conceive and , left unchecked , could have killed her within six weeks			2
@entity9 , 19 , became pregnant with @entity6 while she was being treated for end - stage kidney failure which would have killed her within weeks without treatment the 19 - year - old was told to end her pregnancy or risk dying along with her child - but she refused			1
the story had a happy ending when @entity6 was born , weighing a healthy 6lbs 7oz , in april			1
‘ she 's my little miracle , ’ said single mother @entity5 , a former hotel worker from @entity18			1
‘ when i look at her i can hardly believe what we have both been through			2
‘ i was advised to terminate her because doctors thought there was a chance the pregnancy would kill me because of the risk of pre-eclampsia			1
‘ and , if i survived , there was a high chance she would be born very premature for the same reason			2
that , too , may have led to complications with her health and she may not have survived			2
doctors advised @entity5 to have @entity6 aborted because they feared that the pregnancy could kill her			1
pregnant women with kidney problems have a high rate of the potentially fatal complication pre-eclampsia ‘ when i told the consultants i was pregnant , they said it was very unexpected			2
‘ people told me : “ do n't give your baby a nickname and do n't get attached ” as not many people have got pregnant while in my condition			2
’ forced to choose between risking her own life and giving her unborn child a chance of survival , @entity5 said there was only one decision she could make			1
‘ it was all really upsetting and i was very depressed about it all , ’ she said			0
‘ i had to think long and hard about what to do			0
eventually , i picked myself up and decided to go ahead with the pregnancy			1
‘ i thought it would be the best thing that had ever happened in my life if it worked out			0
‘ the baby would give me a reason to live			0
’ @entity5 discovered she had kidney problem just two months before she found herself pregnant			1
@entity5 decided to continue with the pregnancy and @entity6 was born weighing a healthy 6lbs 7oz , in april			1
she is believed to be entirely healthy despite her precarious start in life she had ignored small bruises all over her legs for two months , thinking they were the result of an allergic reaction			1
she finally decided to see her gp last july - and blood test results revealed her life was in serious danger			2
‘ the doctor called me in and told me to go straight to @entity82 as he thought it was something to do with my kidneys , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ it was a big shock			0
i thought i was going to die and it was very scary			0
’ but the diagnosis started to make sense			0
@entity5 explained : ‘ i have been really pale and tired throughout my life and i used to sleep a lot			1
‘ but lately i had become a bit more tired and dizzy at times			0
@entity5 was diagnosed with kidney failure after developing bruises all over her legs			1
she had previously experienced tiredness and was very pale but had not realised that she was seriously ill ‘ i thought it was just me feeling lazy			0
i did n't really know anything different			0
but the bruises were strange and that was the reason i went to the doctors			2
’ @entity5 was transferred to the @entity101 in @entity102 and , there , was told about her condition			1
‘ i was told there was a really big build - up of toxic waste in my body and i would have died had i left it six weeks			0
’ she was put on dialysis and the transplant list			2
@entity5 said : ‘ i had to leave my job as it was tiring			1
i would go to dialysis at the hospital and try to live my life			2
i discovered i was expecting in september			0
‘ i had the shock of my life as i thought , with my condition , i could n't conceive			0
the doctors at the @entity117 were pretty shocked , too			0
’ throughout the pregnancy , @entity5 had to have dialysis for four hours , six days a week			1
it is believed that it was this strict dialysis regime that saved her and @entity6 @entity5 was put on a new dialysis regime , having treatment six days a week instead of the normal three , which was thought to have helped @entity6 's safe arrival			1
‘ every week i went for a scan and each time i was told she was developing nicely , ’ she said			1
‘ that changed to every two weeks and again , the scans was positive			0
each time i went along my heart was in my mouth			0
i was worried sick , wondering whether she would be ok			0
‘ i did n't want to get my hopes up			0
it was a week - by - week thing and there was a chance i could have miscarried at any point			2
’ but , slowly , @entity5 - who is still undergoing dialysis - began to experience the milestones every mum - to - be dreams of			1
‘ i started to feel her moving inside me and it was lovely when i felt her first kick , ’ she said			0
‘ but i was terrified the whole way through			0
’ because the pregnancy was so high - risk , @entity5 had to have a scan every week until it was confirmed that @entity6 was developing normally finally , on april 17 , just a fortnight before her due date , @entity6 was delivered by caesarean section and declared a healthy baby			1
‘ when i held her in my arms it was the best thing ever , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ and to know there was nothing wrong was even better			0
‘ they told me she was perfectly healthy			2
’ the doctor who led @entity5 's treatment said it was ‘ remarkable ’ that she fell pregnant while so ill. dr @entity161 , kidney consultant at @entity18 's @entity101 , said : ‘ there is a very high rate of pre-eclampsia in kidney disease patients , which will often lead to premature birth			1
‘ if pre-eclampsia is particularly bad , the mother can die			0
the risks for @entity5 were very high and we were up front with her about that			2
‘ we want people to know how much she has been through and highlight the dedication of the nursing team			0
‘ @entity5 had to dialyse six days a week for four hours			1
it was an intense programme which gave her baby the best chance possible			0
‘ she also had the best antenatal care at @entity179			0
i am delighted with the outcome			0

she was advised to have an abortion because pregnancy could kill her
decided to continue with pregnancy and @entity6 was born healthy in april
