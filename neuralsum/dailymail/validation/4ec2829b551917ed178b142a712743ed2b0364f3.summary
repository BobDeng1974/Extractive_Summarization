most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient 's skin entering the surgical wound scientists in the @entity6 have devised an implant in a tiny silk ' purse ' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body			1
up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the @entity14 will develop an infection , and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days			1
surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations , according to a study published last month			1
most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient 's skin entering the surgical wound			1
the most common culprits are staphylococcus aureus bacteria , responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections , coagulase negative staphylococcus , and enterococcus bacteria			1
the infection can usually be treated with antibiotics but sometimes patients need more complex treatment , including further surgery			2
the new implant uses heat to kill off bacteria			0
it consists of a tiny , magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein , and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection , the implant can be switched on using a remote control			1
this raises the temperature of the coil			0
the silk protein protects the coil - both harmlessly dissolve in the body over the next fortnight			2
this is an improvement on previous medical implant devices , which are made from non-degradable materials that need to be removed			0
researchers at @entity60 have used the implant in mice infected with @entity63 , raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes			1
within 24 hours the tissue was infection - free			0
the device , including the coil , completely dissolved after 15 days			0
' this is an important step forward for the development of on - demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely , ' the researchers said			0
' these wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection , for example , or pave the way for eventual " @entity78 " drug delivery			0
' the team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat @entity83 and @entity63			1
@entity84 , consultant vascular and general surgeon at @entity87 , said : ' this is an exciting new concept and an innovative tool against the war of surgical site infection			2
this new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device the concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new , and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues			1
these required retrieval and therefore are not used routinely			0
' this new device would allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device , which then disappears without the need for surgery to remove it			2
' surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery			1
' meanwhile , a team at the @entity116 has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin - resistant @entity63 or @entity119 , which kills thousands of people worldwide each year			1
the bug is a form of @entity63 which does not respond to the usual antibiotics			2
the new treatment is based on a class of drugs called quinazolines , which have been used in treating malaria and cancer			0
they have recently been shown to act on bacteria , too			0
' in recent years , @entity119 has become resistant to vancomycin , our most valuable treatment option against staphylococcal infections , ' said dr @entity136 , whose team developed the new drugs			2
' bacterial disease remains the second - leading cause of death globally , especially among children and the elderly			0
' we need new drugs to fight these infections			0

surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions
new tiny silk ' purse ' that kills infections after surgery is being *trialled*
has been used *successfully* in mice infected with @entity63
