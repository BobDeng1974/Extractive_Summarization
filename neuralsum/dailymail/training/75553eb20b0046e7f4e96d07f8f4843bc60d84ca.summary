if global temperatures continue to rise , the taste of your favourite wine could either drastically change , or the drink could be off the menu completely			2
a wine expert has warned that fine wines in particular , such as @entity8 , are having their flavour significantly altered due to climate change			1
and , as a result , vineyard owners are ditching these grape varieties in favour of those that are better equipped to handle the increases in global temperature			1
drinks such as @entity8 are unable to cope with rising temperatures			1
this is because their grapes ripen faster , and vineyard owners have a more difficult task to work out when they are at optimum flavour the effects are said to be most prominent in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 - although parts of @entity38 , including @entity39 , would also be affected			1
the primary reason is that the grapes are growing faster than before due to increased temperatures - an effect more prominent for wines such as @entity8			1
according to a study by @entity47 in @entity48 , climate change causes sugar levels to mature too quickly , while flavours ‘ lag behind ’			2
waiting to harvest grapes until the flavour is fully developed results in less acidity			0
this creates a ‘ flabby ’ wine with a high alcohol content , as the ratio of sugar to acidity is too high			0
as the atmosphere warms , the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season			0
the optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar - to - acid ratio and the ideal flavour			0
experts also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster			1
this is making it hard for vineyard owners to know when to pick the grapes at the right time to maintain a wine ’s particular taste			1
in her study , wine industry consultant @entity79 , associate professor of sustainability science at @entity20 in @entity21 , wrote : ‘ climate change is beginning to affect the singular flavours that people expect from different wines - the experience you come to know and trust from your favourite reds and whites			1
’ she continued : ‘ as the atmosphere warms , the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season			0
’ ‘ the optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar - to - acid ratio and the ideal flavour			0
’ she also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster			1
according to the @entity98 , the wine industry has already begun adapting to the problem , with vineyards dropping @entity8 in favour of grapes that can tolerate higher temperatures			2
now some vineyards are switching to more temperature - resistant grapes as others like those that make @entity8 ( shown ) struggle			1
this could see such become less widespread , or removed from menus completely earlier this year , researchers also warned that climate change could increase the chances of wine becoming corked			2
the bark of the trees might be being chemically changed by increased exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of climate change			2
the genetic study was led by dr @entity124 of the @entity125 and shows how the £ 1.2 billion ( $ 2 billion ) cork industry is at risk			0
while cork struggles to maintain its consistency , plastic and metal wine stoppers are on the rise			0
to produce a good product , cork producers need bark at least one inch ( 25 millimetres ) thick			0
if the cork is too thin , it will let air into the bottle and ruin the wine			0
but the trees , called @entity143 trees , have undergone a drastic decrease in quality to the point where there bark is now as little as 0.1 inches ( three millimetres ) thick - just 10 per cent the optimum level			0
the reason for this dramatic drop in just two decades was unknown but now dr @entity152 and colleagues think the blame can be pointed at climate change - although she said there could be other culprits .			2

@entity21 expert claims climate change is ruining flavour of certain wines
drinks like @entity8 are unable to cope with increasing temperatures
this is because their grapes ripen faster - so vineyard owners have a more difficult task to work out when they are at optimum flavour
now , some vineyards are switching to more temperature - resistant grapes
this could spell the end of certain wines as grapes are less widespread
