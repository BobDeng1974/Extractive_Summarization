a heady mix of infatuation and attraction , the unmistakable flutter in your stomach and the realisation you are in love			0
your appetite wanes as you anxiously look forward to seeing the object of your affections , and your mind wanders , their presence occupying your every thought			0
but a surge in your libido and a rise in testosterone levels in the body can leave you more prone to suffering an outbreak of unsightly spots , scientists say			2
a new psychological study of couples identified the five stages of love - butterflies , building , assimilation , honesty and stability			1
the findings , collated by dating website @entity34 , were grouped into five stages			2
participants were asked questions about their behaviour and lifestyle , in order to uncover the impact love has on a person 's health at each stage			2
psychologist dr @entity56 , who assisted with the study , told @entity58 the aim was to establish if there are distinct stages of love , how people feel and what happens to them physiologically			1
she said : ' it 's fascinating to note that this one core emotion can be broken down into such distinct stages			0
' what 's more , each stage may be relived and recaptured as couples grow into a relationship , and face different life challenges together			1
' psychologist dr @entity56 said the different stages of love impact on our health , causing weight loss , a lack of sleep and raised stress levels @entity81 : butterflies and the findings suggest of the 33 million @entity84 currently in a relationship , two per cent - or 588,000 people - were found to be enjoying stage one			1
marked by intense infatuation and sexual attraction , symptoms noted by couples included weight loss ( 30 per cent ) and a lack of productivity ( 39 per cent )			1
biologically , it 's reported that during this early stage of dating , both men and women create more of the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen			2
as a result more than half - 56 per cent - noted an increase in their libido			0
dr @entity56 told @entity58 : ' @entity108 comes butterflies - we have all felt it , it 's visceral - you just feel it			2
' @entity113 is a great way to describe it , the time when you ca n't stop having sex			0
' we found people almost forget to eat , there is a sense people are full on love			0
' productivity is not great at this stage , as people 's minds constantly wander			2
' and interestingly , people tend to get pimples in the early stages of a relationship			2
' this is because increases in testosterone cause a rise in sebum , which can block pores and cause a breakout			0
' stage two : building as the initial attraction gives way to learning more about one another , the honeymoon stage subsides and a couple begin to build their relationship			2
@entity34 's study estimated around three per cent of @entity84 in relationship are currently at stage two			1
the body releases neurochemicals called monoamines , which speed up heart rate , trigger rushes of intense pleasure and replicate the effects of @entity158 drugs			1
the biological effect culminates in a feeling of ' happy anxiety ' , where people can think of little else than their blossoming relationship			0
forty - four per cent of the study participants noted a lack of sleep while 29 per cent reported a their attention span had been adversely affected			1
' love changes , it moves slightly further to the point where you are building your relationship , getting you know your partner , ' dr @entity56 said			1
' you may find your attention span is really awful , and you 're not able to focus			0
' it can also be difficult sleeping , you 're literally kept awake thinking about the other person			0
and there is a sense of happy anxiety , where you feel drunk on love			0
' stage three : @entity185 having established whether the other person is ' right ' , stage three forces a couple to question whether the ' relationship ' itself is right			0
questions over the future of the union and forming boundaries in the relationship can lead to a rise in stress levels , reported by 27 per cent of those taking part in the study			1
stage one increases libido , while stage two releases chemicals that replicate the effects of @entity158 drugs			1
love can also impact weight loss , stress levels and sleep patterns dr @entity209 said : ' the third stage is when it becomes more serious , you start thinking " this is more serious than i thought " , and " i know you but where are you at in your life , do we want the same things " , and " can we figure this out "			1
' you begin to see that you assimilate that person into your life			0
' stage four : honesty she said this combined with stage four , where people open up showing the ' real you ' sees the first real rise in stress levels and anxiety			1
' this stage deals with the concept behind how we all put on our best faces , through social media we edit our lives as well as our pictures to make it appear as though everything is fine , ' she said			0
opening up completely triggered feelings of doubt and increased vulnerability in 15 per cent of participants			1
dr @entity209 said : ' interestingly stages three and four see an increase in stress levels			1
' up until now it has been wonderful , feelings of happiness and being content			0
' but the more serious the relationship becomes , the more people worry , " is it what i think it is " ? ' ' vulnerability and stress can manifest itself in various ways , causing unease and obsessiveness around the relationship			2
' stage five : stability but if a couple can weather the emotional rollercoaster of the first four stages , the fifth and final stage , stability , brings with it increased levels of trust and intimacy			1
@entity34 found 50 per cent of respondents had reached this stage , and 23 per cent reported feeling happier as a result			1
biologically , vasopressin - a powerful hormone released by men and women during orgasm - strengthens feelings of attachment			0
the fifth stage , stability , brings with it increased levels of trust and intimacy after weathering the emotional rollercoaster of a relationship meanwhile oxytocin - released during childbirth - deepens feelings of attachment			1
' this is where we see a real level of contentness , ' dr @entity209 told @entity58			1
' we found the body releases wonderful hormones which helps couples bond			0
we noted a real sense of attachment , and a sense of " you have got my back and i 've got yours "			0
@entity301 , spokesperson for @entity302 , said : ' here at @entity34 , we 're responsible for tens of thousands of relationships and millions of " butterfly " moments every year as a result of getting to know both the heads and hearts of our members			0
' ' while love does n't have a rule book , our unique compatibility system matches members on the 29 key personality dimensions needed for a successful relationship including emotional temperament , core values and social skills â€“ giving singles the best possible matches and better dates			0

@entity34 study identified the stages as butterflies , building , assimilation , honesty and stability

love can also impact weight loss , stress levels and sleep patterns
@entity344 reported a lack of productivity , increased vulnerability , as well as *delirious* happiness before reaching the comfort of stage five
