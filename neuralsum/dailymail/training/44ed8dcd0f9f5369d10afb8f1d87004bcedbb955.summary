by @entity0 published : 12:58 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 13:01 est , 31 august 2012 a purebred @entity2 bison is living at the @entity3 after scientists were able to successfully implant a genetically pure embryo into a commercial bison			1
this is great news for the park - as around 40 per cent of the natural herd suffer from brucellosis , which can cause pregnant animals to miscarry , meaning the future of the most world 's genetically - pure breed could be at risk			2
the zoo and @entity17 announced yesterday that the surrogate bison gave birth to a healthy male calf at the zoo on june 20			0
while many bison have been bred with cattle , @entity2 has one of the world 's largest and most genetically - pure bison herds			1
but concern about the disease has prevented the animals from being taken out of the park to reproduce			0
@entity46 bison herds use to roam across @entity47 , until humans almost wiped them out in the centuries leading up to the early 20th century			0
many bison have some cattle genes , but @entity2 's bison are ' genetically uninterrupted ' , reports @entity54			2

@entity2 bison was born at @entity3 on june 20th
helps allay fears over the future of the species , which is at risk *due* to a disease causing huge *numbers* of miscarriages
