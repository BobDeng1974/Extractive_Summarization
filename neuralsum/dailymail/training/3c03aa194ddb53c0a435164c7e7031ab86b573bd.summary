satellite images released by @entity1 show the shocking extent of water shortage in @entity4 as it 's revealed that some communities have been left without water for five months during the record - breaking drought			1
the colors in the ' @entity10 ' images , released by the grace program , progress from green to orange then red , showing how much the water storage has dried up in the region since 2002			1
according to the space agency , @entity4 's @entity17 and @entity18 basins , including the @entity19 , have suffered the greatest losses			1
part of this is due to increased groundwater from reservoirs and rivers being pumped to support agricultural production			1
the amount far exceeds the amount @entity4 's 38 million residents use in cities and homes annually			1
across the whole of the state , 63 trillion gallons have been lost since 2013 - the equivalent of having the @entity42 west of the @entity43 flooded in four inches of water			2
the drought is now in its third year and has caused rivers to dry up , agricultural land to become untenable and water bills to soar			2
around 500 residents in @entity50 have been left without running water for five months			0
it means they are unable to shower , flush a toilet or fill a glass without getting a bottle or a bucket			0
@entity58 , who lives in @entity59 , told the @entity60 : ' when you wake up in the middle of the night sick to your stomach , you have to think about where the water bottle is before you can use the toilet			2
' the @entity58 family 's drinking water comes only from bottles , mostly received through donations but sometimes bought at the gas station			1
to wash her children 's hair , mrs @entity58 has to use water from buckets which mr @entity76 has to refill from the county 's fire station every day			1
@entity58 from @entity59 , @entity4 , uses a container of non-potable water to wash her dishes			1
she has not had running water for five months and relies on taps or donated water bottles she has been forced to wash the hair of her daughter , @entity86 , with non-potable water for showering , washing dishes and flushing toilets , the family relies on buckets filled with water from a tank set in the front lawn , which mr. @entity76 replenishes every other day at the county fire station			1
often , the water runs out before he returns home from his job as a mechanic , forcing ms. @entity58 to wait for hours before she can clean			0
the local high school has begun allowing students to arrive early and shower there			0
the @entity103 had already allotted $ 500,000 to buy bottled water for @entity59 residents , said @entity106 of the board 's @entity107			2
low water levels are visible from a boat ramp at the @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity4			2
as @entity4 suffers through a third straight year of drought , the state 's reservoirs are at record lows but many @entity59 residents , like @entity118 , say all they want is to get a glass of water from the kitchen sink			1
her well dried up nearly two months ago , she said , making life challenging for her husband and three children			0
to bathe , they each have to fill a bucket from a 300 - gallon tank in the front yard , carry it inside and pour water over their heads with a cup			0
they 've lived in their home for 21 years , she said			0
' it 's not that easy to say , " @entity138			0
" ' @entity59 sits along the @entity139 , which starts high in the mountains and runs through the unincorporated town			0
typically , river water permeates the sandy soil under the community , filling up wells as shallow as 30 feet deep			0
drought has caused the river to run dry , along with the wells			0
