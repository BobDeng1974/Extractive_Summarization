@entity0 : the new reforms to stamp duty ' has made @entity4 's mansion tax redundant ' @entity7 's flagship mansion tax policy has been rendered effectively redundant by @entity9 ’s recent stamp duty reforms , a report claims			1
@entity4 would impose an annual tax of thousands of pounds on people living in homes worth more than £ 2million to raise an estimated £ 1.2billion a year			1
but the chancellor ’s reforms have already increased the tax burden on high value homes by £ 1.1billion a year and mean the top 1.6 per cent of households – with homes worth more than £ 1million – now pay 45 per cent of all stamp duty , the @entity13 says			1
the think - tank claims any further taxation on high - value property owners would be ‘ difficult to justify on grounds of fairness ’			0
its study says ‘ any justification for a mansion tax has been significantly eroded ’ by recent stamp duty increases on high - value properties			1
while the reforms mean the majority of buyers save money , those purchasing homes costing more than £ 937,500 will pay a higher tax bill			1
the maximum stamp duty charge , levied on homes costing more than £ 1.5million , is now 12 per cent compared to 7 per cent previously			1
separate changes have closed a loophole which allowed people to avoid paying stamp duty on an expensive home by purchasing it through a company , rather than as an individual			2
the report said these two changes meant the top 1.6 per cent of households pay almost half of all stamp duty collected by the taxman			2
it said @entity7 ’s mansion tax proposal was crude , would take no account of an individual ’s ability to pay , would be expensive to administer and would raise insignificant revenues			2
@entity7 ’s £ 1.2billion a year estimate is equivalent to less than one - quarter of 1 per cent of current tax revenues			0
the think - tank warned that the tax would seriously undermine the attraction of investing in the @entity65 to rich overseas buyers , risking a ‘ wider economic impact ’			0
it also claimed the tax would suppress property values at the top end of the market , diminishing tax receipts for inheritance tax and stamp duty			1
at least £ 1 in every £ 6 raised by a mansion tax would be lost this way , it said			1
@entity78 , of the @entity13 , said a mansion tax was ‘ unfair , complex , uncertain and inefficient ’			2
@entity9 's reforms to stamp duty have already increased the tax burden on high value homes by £ 1.1billion a year and mean the top 1.6 per cent of households now pay 45 per cent of all stamp duty he said : ‘ ultimately , the proposed mansion tax is little more than an appeal to envy ’ , adding that it would drive ‘ cash poor , asset rich , households to sell their houses ’			1
property lawyer @entity94 , at @entity95 , said it would hit the middle classes			0
he said : ‘ a mansion tax , by itself , is unlikely to faze wealthy international buyers and ultra-high net worths buying in @entity102 and across the @entity65			2
‘ it is actually a levy on the capital ’s middle classes , particularly baby boomers who bought big cheap houses until the 1990s			0
many of these cash poor but asset rich older people will sell up and downsize			0
’ shadow chancellor @entity113 has said people in homes worth £ 2million to £ 3million would pay £ 3,000 a year in mansion tax , with the charge for properties worth more than that being revealed after the election			1
economists claim that it could average £ 24,000 a year			0
some @entity123 have publicly criticised the plans and party grandee @entity125 has said it would end up ‘ clobbering ’ people			0
but last night @entity7 said a mansion tax would help pay for 20,000 more nurses , 8,000 more gps , 5,000 more home care workers and 3,000 more midwives			0
those who could not afford the tax upfront could have it rolled up and paid from their estate after their death .			0

new stamp duty reforms have made @entity4 's tax policy ' redundant '
mansion tax would affect owners of homes worth more than £ 2m
but reforms have already increased the tax burden on high value homes
