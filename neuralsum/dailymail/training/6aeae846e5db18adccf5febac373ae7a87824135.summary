by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 are close to losing the remaining members of the @entity3 from the coaching structure of the club as @entity6 makes plans for next season as manager			1
while the club insist that @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 will all be offered roles under @entity15 , who last week confirmed @entity16 as his assistant , it is understood that @entity11 , who has already said publicly that he does not expect to be at @entity1 , is unlikely to accept			1
@entity12 already has a job with the under - 21s , though it has yet to be confirmed that he will continue in that role next season , having stepped up to help the first team when @entity23 was sacked , while @entity13 is also unlikely to accept a post without a clear role			1
video : scroll down for @entity16 , @entity11 , @entity27 and @entity12 challenge builders to kickabout glitz : the foursome at the [ remiere of their film ' @entity34 ' think tank : @entity16 is staying , but might be staying but @entity11 looks set to leave none of the three old boys has been contacted by @entity1 executive chairman @entity38 to clarify their position in the past week , although the club are comfortable that given their close relationship with @entity16 , they are kept abreast of developments			1
until @entity15 and @entity16 settle on a coaching team the club maintain it is difficult to specify the exact roles the three might take , though @entity1 and @entity15 are keen to retain them			1
@entity11 , who would want a clearly defined job rather than a general coaching role , is likely to turn his attention to @entity50 , the @entity51 club the players purchased last season along with @entity16 and @entity54			1
all three are understood to have been frustrated by the lack of communication from @entity1 over their futures			0
@entity38 and @entity15 now have to deliver on the summer transfer plans , though @entity15 ’s focus will inevitably be largely on his plans for the @entity62 as @entity64 coach			1
@entity1 were close to signing @entity66 midfielder @entity65 for this summer , with former manager @entity23 and @entity67 having put in considerable work to ensure he would come to the club			2
however , @entity15 is not minded to pursue the @entity71 midfielder			0
with @entity73 left - back @entity72 already lined up for £ 27million , @entity1 will make a move for @entity75 , the @entity76 and @entity71 centre - half , who will cost £ 30m , though the transfer is unlikely to be concluded until after the @entity62			1
@entity75 is the one signing on which @entity15 will insist , though he also recognises the need to strengthen in midfield			2
@entity83 ’s @entity82 , who was key in @entity15 ’s @entity64 teams , will be added , although probably not until january , as his cruciate knee ligament injury means he will not be able to prove his fitness before then			0
@entity15 is expected to turn his attention to @entity88 , the @entity89 captain and a part of his @entity62 team			0
@entity88 , 24 , the son of @entity93 star @entity92 , can play at left - back or holding midfield			0
making his mark : it is looking less and less likely that @entity6 will keep them all at the club @entity100 : @entity66 's @entity65 ( right ) was wanted by @entity23 before he was sacked sign them up : @entity15 wants @entity72 and @entity75 to strength @entity1 's defensive line @entity15 and @entity67 will have to move quickly to avoid the mistakes of last summer , when transfer dealing was put on hold until @entity23 started the job officially in july			1
@entity15 is unlikely to be available to work full - time until early july , when @entity64 ’s participation in the @entity62 is over			0
with significant key players no longer in the squad - @entity112 , @entity114 and @entity16 - there is an urgent need to bolster the experience and strength of the squad , which is why the club will pay what is required to bring in @entity75			2
@entity38 will be under pressure to deliver for @entity15 after last year ’s dreadful summer , when @entity1 missed out on key targets like @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , before launching a last - minute rush to sign @entity129 for £ 27.5m , with the former @entity131 player proving a huge disappointment			2
@entity38 ’s performance last summer was criticised severely and it remains to be seen if @entity1 have the executive structure capable of landing their first - choice targets			0
deep end : @entity1 's chairman @entity38 was heavily criticised for his poor transfer dealings last summer missed : key transfers targets such as @entity124 and @entity125 were n't acquired last summer abject : @entity23 ' only major signing of last summer , @entity129 , failed to have an impact of @entity143 with sir @entity144 and @entity145 no longer having day - to - day involvement and @entity147 , the chief operating officer , moving to @entity148 , @entity67 and managing director @entity149 now have a huge range of responsibilities			0
@entity15 ’s contacts in @entity154 football will help @entity67 , which is why there is confidence @entity75 will be secured , and why @entity157 and @entity82 should be obtainable			0
@entity124 , who @entity1 thought they could sign last summer , is now available with @entity158 ready to let him go , but @entity15 has not indicated that he wants the player			2
other potential midfield targets include @entity161 , who wants to leave @entity66 , but @entity162 , the midfielder most of @entity164 ’s top sides , including @entity1 , have been keen to sign despite a long - term injury last season , recently penned a new deal at @entity76 .			0

@entity16 set to be assistant under @entity6 next season

@entity72 already lned up , and @entity15 set to move for @entity75
