exchanging sexual images between children has become commonplace in many schools , campaigners warn teachers have been given powers to delete sexting images from pupils ' phones which could be covering up the scale of the indecent images circulating in schools and online			1
former culture secretary @entity13 told @entity14 that children must be taught that sharing explicit images is a sexual offence : ' the worst sort of crime '			1
the government admits it does not collect data on the number of incidents of sexting in schools or how many cases are referred to police or prosecutors			1
sharing explicit images of under - 18s is an offence even if they are taken by the youngsters themselves			1
search powers introduced by the coalition to help schools impose discipline give teachers the power to search for and delete , inappropriate images from pupils ' phones			1
there are concerns that schools are deleting the photographs from one mobile handset and disciplining pupils discreetly , without investigating how fare the images have spread			1
it is also suggested that criminal gangs could try to infiltrate school networks to obtain images of children under the age of 16			1
mrs @entity13 , who resigned as @entity55 earlier this year , warned : ' simply deleting that image on the camera that took the photo ignores the very real problem that they have been distributed far more widely			1
' some charities , including the @entity62 , have suggested that exchanging sexting images is not a normal part of school life for many teenagers			1
but mrs @entity13 insisted : ' the idea of sending illegal sex abuse images is not part of teenage life			1
it is often something that happens at the start of a relationship before emotional ties are formed			0
' these illegal , indecent images are often circulated far more widely than the original personal who took the photograph intended			2
' she added : ' it is a sexual offence , it is the worst sort of crime			2
it is storing up a real problem for those young people			2
those images are going to stay with them forever			2
that is what young people are not aware of			0
' mrs @entity13 raised concerns that by allowing schools to delete images off young people 's phones headteachers might not be ' addressing the scale of the problem '			1
' there is no statutory duty for schools to report sexting but they do have a duty to report criminal offences			1
' but the @entity105 does n't seem to have the records which will set out how many offences have been reported			0
' former culture secretary @entity13 told @entity14 she was concerned schools are deleting images and not dealing with how far they have spread or teaching pupils about the serious nature of committing a sex offence criminal gangs could be encouraging schoolchildren to engage in sexting to generate images for child porn websites , @entity13 warned			1
she questioned whether ' there is the involvement of third parties asking for those images to be generated in the first place '			2
the @entity105 does not collect data on the number of incidents of sexting in schools but mrs @entity13 said : ' you can not underestimate the cunning nature of those involved in this industry			1
' the police have not been able to pick up trends that might imply the involvement of organised crime in sexting			2
' a recent survey by @entity136 of 13 - 18 year - olds found that 60 per cent said they had been asked for a sexual image or video of themselves			2
and four in ten said they had taken an image and a quarter had sent the image or video on to someone else			0
one in five reports to the @entity147 ( @entity147 ) relates to self - generated indecent images			1
a survey of calls fo @entity136 last year found 28 per cent mentioned secting			0
in a series of parliamentary questions , ministers have admitted that statistics are not kept on the scale of sexting in schools			1
@entity105 minister @entity159 said : ' @entity160 does not hold information on the number of cases of indecent images of children either self - taken , or possessed , by an under - 18 reported to the police or referred to the @entity167			1
' she added : we have a responsibility to educate young people to use technology safely and strongly discourage them from sharing self - taken indecent photographs			2
' @entity147 has developed a ' specific educational resource ' to tackle sexting to be used by teachers			0
and schools minister @entity176 said : ' the @entity177 does not collect data on incidents of sexting among pupils			1
' schools can help to contain cyber-bullying and sexting during the school day by banning or limiting the use of mobile phones and other electronic devices			2
' search powers included in the @entity189 have given teachers the power to search for , and if necessary delete , inappropriate images ( or files ) on electronic devices , including mobile phones			0
' mrs @entity13 , who has recently held talks with child abuse law experts in the @entity197 about how to tackle the problem , said : ' schools have been left in a really invidious position			1
they have the authority to delete images			0
' they are undoubtedly doing a great deal to support teachers and young people who are affected by sexting , but i am concerned that there seems to be a lack of information about how many of these incidents are reported to police			2
' she stressed that she did not want to criminalise every young person but to ' ensure those images are removed and to make sure we are fully aware of whether there is the involvement of third parties asking for those images to be generated in the first place '			0
the @entity62 said sexting ' is playing an increasingly insidious role in young people 's relationships [ file picture ] revenge porn - when people publish sexually explicit pictures of former partners - is to be made a new offence punishable by up to two years in jail			1
distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress will be made a specific offence in the @entity243			0
it has already passed the @entity245 and is due to reach the @entity246 next week			0
latest figures show children as young as 11 had been victims , while pop stars @entity251 and @entity252 have also been targeted			0
@entity253 , head of child safety online at the @entity62 , said : ' @entity62 research shows ' sexting ' is playing an increasingly insidious role in young people 's relationships			0
' children may take these images to please a boyfriend or girlfriend but things can quickly spiral out of control			2
' relationships break down and in a moment of spite images can be shared widely			0
sometimes a boyfriend sends an image or video to a mate to show off , who in turn may post it online			0
' with a few clicks , what is meant to be private is being seen on hundreds of websites , potentially ending up in sex offender collections			0
' while we would n't want children who do this to be prosecuted apart from in the most extreme and exceptional cases , it 's important to remember that taking and sharing any indecent image of a child , even when it was taken with their consent , is a serious offence			1
' child protection chief dr @entity289 warned last week that celebrities could be fuelling the trend in children exchanging explicit images			1
she told the @entity295 said : ' obviously children and particularly older children are looking at celebrities and are looking at what the adult population are doing			0
she added : ' i think we 've got to the point with older teenagers where sexting is a normative behaviour			0
' what we need to do is get them to recognise when it 's abusive , when it 's harmful , when it 's linked to exploitation , when it 's linked to the beginning point of an exploitative relationship			0
' meanwhile gps have been told to ask teenagers if they have been victims of revenge porn			0
new guidelines have been drawn up to spot youngsters being made ill as a result of anxiety caused by sexting , cyber-bullying and radicalisation online			0
the pressures of young people 's lives played out online means they could be the trigger for headaches and stomach pains , or the reason while children start to play truant , the @entity324 warned last month .			0
