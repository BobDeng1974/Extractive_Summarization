the family claim that a @entity0 official demanded that the disabled woman say her name as he sought additional id because she had only a photocopy of an expired driver 's license			1
however @entity0 officials insist that miss @entity3 was not allowed to board the flight because she did not have valid @entity11 - having provided only a poor photocopy of an expired driving license - and not because she as unable to say her name			1
she claimed the confrontation happened after she presented the official with additional @entity11 because of the expired driver 's license			0
