the health watchdog that damned the @entity2 's first privately run hospital ignored a spot check by its own inspectors that found huge improvements in standards			1
the vital findings have been suppressed for nearly four months , and have only emerged now after the @entity8 quietly revised its report to rate many of the hospital 's services as ' good '			1
in january the commission branded @entity13 in @entity14 as ' inadequate ' and placed it in special measures , along with a dozen of the worst hospitals in the country			1
but today the watchdog will upgrade this to ' requires improvement ' and publish a glowing report			1
in january the commission branded @entity13 in @entity14 as ' inadequate ' experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch - up by @entity31 activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation			1
the new version of the report rates the hospital as ' good ' in 18 out of 33 criteria that were assessed including its outpatients departments and overall standard of end - of - life care			2
it also praises a number of the hospital 's departments and individuals as ' outstanding ' including its maternity ward , intensive care unit , specialist children 's nurse in @entity53 and the chaplain			2
crucially , the report – a draft of which has been leaked to the @entity58 – shows that the @entity8 ignored a second , far more positive spot check of the hospital when it published its initial report			1
in january – a week before the first report came out – inspectors returned to check up on two wards where they had raised concerns about standards of care during a visit in september			1
they found major improvements and praised nurses for treating patients with dignity and respect , responding promptly to call bells and ensuring patients were not in pain			2
yet the watchdog ignored these findings when placing the hospital in special measures			0
@entity13 – which serves 160,000 patients in @entity83 – was controlled by the private firm circle from february 2012 until last month			2
@entity2 patients were treated there as usual but @entity84 – rather than @entity2 managers – was in charge of the day - to - day running of the hospital and its budget			2
the firm was praised for driving down waiting times , lowering the death rate , reducing infections and improving overall care			0
after january 's report @entity84 announced it would be withdrawing from its contract			2
the hospital is now being run by the @entity99			0
the rating of ' requires improvement ' in the revised report moves the hospital from the bottom 13 per cent of hospital trusts in the country to an average score , which is achieved by 59 per cent of organisations			0
today the watchdog will upgrade the ' inadequate ' finding to ' requires improvement ' and publish a glowing report the @entity58 has repeatedly highlighted concerns by mps and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation			1
one of the inspectors was a member of the campaign group @entity119			0
another was a senior figure in the @entity122 , the doctors ' trade union , who had previously spoken out about the dangers of private firms ' involvement in the @entity2			0
neither took part in the spot checks a week before january 's report			1
@entity133 mep @entity132 said : ' this is an extraordinary procedure and raises serious questions about how the @entity8 goes about its inspections			0
' it 's an admission by the watchdog that its first inspection report was over the top and far too tough			0
it 's all been heavily influenced by the public service unions			0
i will be writing to the health secretary to demand a full investigation into whether this was a stitch - up			0
' a spokesman for @entity84 said : ' this vindicates our view that the inspection of @entity13 was flawed			0
the evidence has always been that @entity13 was a good hospital , with low mortality rates , low waiting times , and positive reviews from other @entity2 regulators			1

the @entity8 damned the @entity2 's first privately run hospital
but it ignored its own inspectors ' spot check that found improvements
in january the commission branded @entity13 as ' inadequate '
today the commission will upgrade this and publish a glowing report
