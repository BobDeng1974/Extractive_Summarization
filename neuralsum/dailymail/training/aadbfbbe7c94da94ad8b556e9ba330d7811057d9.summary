by @entity0 published : 19:16 est , 28 february 2014 updated : 09:49 est , 1 march 2014 @entity2 are not impressed with the in - house @entity4 tv station encouraging @entity7 fans to mock @entity2 ’s lack of history compared to @entity11 ’s glittering back story			1
an @entity14 camera crew was outside @entity4 talking to @entity7 supporters , who were visiting the stadium ahead of the @entity18 game at the @entity19 , with the questioning designed to be at @entity2 ’s expense			1
the staged answers included : ‘ @entity23 is known as @entity11 ’			0
‘ apart from the last two years , @entity2 is not known in @entity24 ’			2
‘ the comparison is like between @entity7 and @entity26 ’			2
tourists : @entity7 fans flocked to @entity4 for a look when they visited @entity23 there is surprise at @entity2 that @entity14 should resort to such small - minded ideas during a troubled period			1
city policy , since their @entity36 ‘ welcome to @entity23 ’ poster after he switched clubs in 2009 , has been to not rile the neighbours			0
and even at @entity11 , there is criticism with one official saying : ‘ we take a dim view of this			0
’ @entity14 ’s tv listings are also open to ridicule , with thursday ’s schedule having all the @entity47 followed by @entity48 : the first six months			2
statement : @entity2 put up a poster in the city centre after signing @entity36 in 2009 the ongoing scandal around secondary ticket site @entity55 ’s continuing selling of @entity57 tickets , despite successful court actions against them by the @entity60 , is highlighted by the @entity62 ticket for the @entity64 game being traded on the site before it was acquired			1
touts are now using @entity55 to sell tickets they do not have , speculating they will acquire the right seat before collection			1
@entity62 — absolved from wrongdoing — left a ticket for @entity72 team - mate @entity71 and it ended up being handed over by a tout to the purchaser , who bought it the day before on @entity55 for £ 440			1
the tout got the ticket less than two hours before kick - off from a hospitality client who had bought it for face value from @entity72 coach @entity83			0
out of his hands : @entity62 's ticket for the @entity64 game was traded on secondary ticket site @entity55 @entity89 batsman @entity88 is recovering from a stress - related illness			1
so it does n’t seem the best idea to join @entity94 — used as a social media bear pit by @entity89 team - mates as shown by @entity97 yesterday sniping back in tweets at criticisms by @entity100			1
@entity94 : @entity89 batsman @entity88 has joined @entity94 as he recovers from a stress - related illness the @entity104 ’s roster of sponsors were asking questions yesterday as to why @entity89 manager @entity107 was televised at @entity108 announcing his squad for next week ’s @entity111 game in front of a backdrop monopoly of @entity115 branding rather than shared logo exposure			1
the @entity104 agreed the deal with the bookmakers as part of a @entity107 personal appearance			1
but with the @entity104 currently investigating @entity122 manager @entity121 for breaching betting regulations , it smacked of double standards			2
announcement : @entity89 manager @entity107 revealed his squad in front of a backdrop of @entity115 branding wags pay their way @entity107 is relaxed about @entity89 wags coming to @entity133 for the @entity135 camp and on to @entity136 for the tournament — in the knowledge not many are expected to travel			1
apart from staying with the players at @entity142 ’s @entity141 , all travel arrangements will have to be made by the families			0
this contrasts with the @entity130 circus in @entity146 in 2006 where @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 were looked after by @entity104 administrator @entity151 , for whom former @entity153 boss @entity152 left his wife of 20 years last october			0
@entity155 : @entity148 was among the wives and girlfriends who went to the 2006 @entity158 in @entity159 @entity160 , grumbling about @entity89 quitter @entity161 being honoured at their spring lunch , are also up in arms about the trustees decision to sell their £ 6m headquarters near @entity167 , which was purchased with the help of the £ 1m raised by sir @entity169 running the @entity170 in 1999			2
lt chief executive @entity171 said selling the building would mean more money going to charity			0
lawyers as ever will be the main winners over financial fair play at home and abroard			0
@entity180 are expecting numerous appeals to the @entity182 when they hand out sanctions — possibly wage caps — in june for those found to have breached @entity187 rules			0
the 76 clubs being probed include @entity2			0
and this follows 10 @entity191 clubs threatening legal action over @entity194 rules			0
