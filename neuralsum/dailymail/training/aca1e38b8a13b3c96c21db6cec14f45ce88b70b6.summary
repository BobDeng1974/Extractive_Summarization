by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 06:58 est , 14 november 2012 are you a folder , a stacker , a hanger , a shover - inner or a hide - away - in - a - drawer kind of person ? exactly how you keep your clothes - and therefore just how tidy your wardrobe is - says a lot about a person			2
and one award - winning @entity12 photographer , @entity11 , set out to explore just how much , taking a series of very intimate photographs of some residents of @entity17 next to their closets , giving the viewer a snapshot into each subject 's life			1
and regardless of what we know about @entity12 style , it seems the people of @entity12 's fashion capital have just as many fashion disasters as the rest of us ...			2
the student : @entity33 , a student in @entity17 , opens her white wardrobe in her pink room and shows the photographer her shoe collection @entity11 travelled all over the @entity12 city ( known for its designer gear and luxury goods ) on the hunt for a variety of different people whose styles and fashion blunders would provide an insight into their characters			1
on his journey he met a wide range of clothes - keepers - women , men , couples and teenagers - each of whom had a wardrobe with a totally unique story to tell			0
there is @entity60 the student , whose pink bedroom contains a white wardrobe full of high - heeled shoes ; denise the fancy - dress fanatic whose large cupboard is stuffed full of @entity69 get - ups and anime outfits ; @entity71 the entrepreneur who shares her bedroom with a cat and dachshund , but keeps her wardrobe to herself and crams it with colourful dresses and hats ; and suni the glass artist , whose wardrobe is in her workshop			0
@entity11 also found two retired couples with contrasting closets , a pr man with a fascination with air travel , two journalists - one male , one female - with completely different ways of organising their clothes , a priest , a pair of tattoo artists and a couple of teenage girls			1
the @entity97 : @entity98 the cosplayer ( someone who dresses up like an anime character ) poses in one of her skimpiest outfits beside a box of @entity69 paraphernalia the unique collection of images , dubbed @entity108 , has earned the 35 - year - old an honourable mention in the @entity112 category of the 2012 @entity113			1
he said : ' to the rest of the world @entity17 is one of the main references for fashion and luxury brands			2
the true vision of the everyday is almost blocked and hidden by the big names in fashion and design			0
for this project i wanted to photograph the ordinary @entity128 people in front of their open closets			0
' they are all different ages , genders , social classes and professions because i wanted to create a collage of a mixed city that hides its most intriguing side			0
i have tried to find and am still continuing to look for these extraordinary people			0
