published : 12:11 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 19 february 2013 a man who was late to return to his parked car by one minute because doctors were telling him that his elderly father had terminal cancer was given a parking ticket			1
@entity6 , of @entity7 , attended an appointment at the @entity9 for his father @entity10 , 77 , who was suffering lung cancer			2
mr @entity6 was expecting to attend a routine appointment on november 20 last year to receive news about his father , who was admitted to hospital five days beforehand			2
@entity6 was fined him for overstaying in a car park by just one minute after learning about his father 's terminal condition but at the end of the appointment , a consultant asked to see @entity6 especially and gave him the bad news that his father was terminally ill. beforehand , hgv driver mr @entity6 believed he had ample time to get back to his car and his parking ticket which was due to expire at 7.11pm			1
but as the consultant called him back he faced a wait and was left unable to get back in time			2
as he came to terms with the devastating news about his dad , mr @entity6 ran back to the car to put more money in the machine for a new parking ticket , realising it was on the verge of expiring			1
he had put £ 1 in the machine at 6.11pm for an hour 's parking at @entity43 car park in @entity7 operated by @entity44 , which is situated next to the hospital			1
but as mr @entity6 returned to his car , he was shocked to find a parking fine slapped on their car for £ 60 after he arrived - just six minutes after the expiry time			1
mr @entity6 says despite pleading wit the operator about the fine , they said he had breached the rules and would not drop it there is a five minute period of grace on parking times - meaning mr @entity6 was parked illegally for just one minute			1
despite pleas about his circumstances to @entity44 , mr @entity6 was told the fine still applied			1
mr @entity6 , 52 , has since been fighting the fine and appealed twice against the charge to no avail			2
mr @entity6 claims he received a further blow when he first tried to appeal and @entity44 claimed he had parked illegally , blocking the main entrance for other vehicles and increased the fine to £ 90			1
however , this offence was dated december 3 2012 , almost two weeks after mr @entity6 ' parking fine			1
it is understood @entity44 accepted that mr @entity6 was not responsible for the offence on december 3 but refused to rescind the original parking fine , which was then increased to £ 120 for non-payment with 14 days of the fine being issued			1
mr @entity6 said : ' i think it 's absolutely disgusting			2
they should consider showing compassion in light of why i was late back to the car			2
' i did n't think i would be late , i thought i 'd left ample time , but it was because the consultant called me back to give me the bad news that this happened			1
@entity6 's displayed ticket , and the fine notice issued , after his car was spotted for overstaying by one minute ' then they accused me of parking illegally , which was not true , our car never blocked the main gate but they claimed they had @entity96 which proved it			1
' the date of that offence was december 3 , so it definitely was n't me			0
' i refused to pay , it was the principle , but then i got a letter from a debt collection agency saying i had to pay within seven days , so i had no choice			0
' mr @entity6 ' father , who was married to @entity105 , 77 , died on november 29 after the couple took him home where he would be more comfortable in his final days			0
the former miner , who worked at both @entity109 and @entity110 mines , battled cancer after being diagnosed with leukaemia four years ago			0
@entity113 , the @entity114 area manager for @entity44 said the fine would not be scrapped			2
mr @entity113 said : ' while i fully sympathise with mr @entity6 ' circumstances , as i 've lost family members through cancer myself , we can not overturn the ticket because it was in breach of terms and conditions			2
' if this was a hospital - controlled car park it would be different , but we have to act on the land owner 's behalf , who we operate the car park on behalf of			0
' it is not owned by the hospital			0
it is run by the rules and regulations of the land owner			0
' there is a five minute period of grace after a ticket expired , but this had expired			0
' i want to point out it is not a personal decision , it is based on the rules			0
' mr @entity6 appealed against the ticket through an ombudsman , but last week received a letter saying he had to pay £ 90 within a week from a debt collection agency			1
the car park is not operated or owned by the @entity150 , but is situated near to the hospital			0
he said : ' i 've paid it now , but i 'm sickened and disgusted			0
' there 's meant to be a five minute period of grace , i know that , i was just one minute over that and i 'd had really bad news			1
' my dad died just days later			0
' i think it 's a complete disgrace and i ca n't believe this company is allowed to operate near to a hospital			0
' they do n't take into account people 's personal circumstances , it 's completely callous			0
' i just want other people to be aware of this company and what they do			0
