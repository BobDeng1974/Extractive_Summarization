the @entity12 has called for the city to bid for the @entity14 , but dr @entity4 is less sold on the idea			0
victorian premier @entity4 says @entity1 had the right facilities in place to host another @entity3 @entity1 has hosted the @entity3 before in 1956 , with @entity18 lighting the torch at the opening ceremony ( pictured ) ' we are a sporting city			1
