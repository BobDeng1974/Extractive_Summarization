by @entity0 published : 02:42 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 13 december 2013 the mothers of two little girls both suffering incurable diseases became acquainted in an unusual way - and found their daughters ' lives , like their names , were startlingly similar			1
@entity8 is mother to five - year - old @entity9 who suffers mitochondrial disease , and @entity12 is the mother of five - year - old @entity13 , who has transverse mylitis			1
friends of the two , realizing that @entity9 is in desperate need of an oxygen tank and @entity13 needs a new wheelchair , created a @entity21 page for the little girls to raise money for their medical care			1
they began talking and realized they had much in common as mothers of three children			2
@entity40 mentioned her sister , @entity12 and her daughter @entity13			1
' i never could have imagined how blessed i would be to have @entity40 come into my life and how impactful that connection would turn out to be , ' writes @entity8 on her blog @entity54			2
' while the diagnoses are different the life experiences of our girls have been remarkably similar			2
in fact the parallels in their stories are incredible and it 's easy to see that the wee warriors are kindred spirits right down to their city names			0
' catalyst : @entity67 and @entity8 met through actress @entity68 , pictured ( left ) in character on @entity39 and ( right ) at a film premiere @entity13 's condition , transverse mylitis , is a neurological disorder caused by inflammation across both sides of one level , or segment , of the spinal cord			1
after initially being paralyzed by the condition as a 15 - month - old , @entity13 has mad a good recovery but ca n't walk for long periods of time and experiences constant pain due to transverse mylitis			1
@entity9 has @entity87 mitochondrial disease			1
she was diagnosed three weeks after her first birthday			0
her mother writes that the condition has ' caused her body to experience poor growth , hypermobility ( @entity96 ’s @entity95 3 ) , hypotonia , @entity98 and other gastrointestinal issues , hypoglycemia , asthma , immunodeficiency , chronic infections , seizures , dysautonomia , polydipsia / polyuria , dysphagia , reflux , vasso - constriction / dilation and lactic acidosis among other things			0
' fighter : @entity13 walks as much as she can but she needs a new wheelchair to help her get around this currently incurable cellular energy disorder keeps @entity9 ’s body from being able to convert food and oxygen into energy			1
this causes cell damage , and eventually cell death			0
there is no cure for the disease and many sufferers do not make it to their teenage years			0
both little girls have spent much of their short lives in hospitals , hooked up to machines and in pain			0
' if they survived at all , it was doubtful they would ever be able to talk , walk or function on their own , ' reads the @entity21 page			2
the little fighters have both proved that they 're made of stronger stuff			0
@entity13 walks and @entity9 's progress has been nothing less than remarkable			1
but there 's still a long way to go for both of them			0
as babies : @entity8 and @entity9 ( left ) and @entity67 with @entity13 ' @entity40 [ @entity148 ] and another incredible woman who came into our life because of her , @entity152 , and two other gals @entity154 and @entity155 set up a @entity21 page for @entity9 and @entity13 , ' writes @entity8			1
' we have done many fundraisers through the years to benefit some amazing organizations doing research for a cure but we have never fundraised directly for @entity9 's medical needs			2
as i 'm sure @entity12 would agree its a tough thing to do ...			0
ask people for direct support			0
but the truth is our girls have medical needs right now that surpass what we can cover out of pocket on our own			2
that 's why this page , this campaign , means the world to us			0
' the money will be split 50/50 between @entity9 and @entity13			1
so far , the campaign has raised $ 4,250 .			0
