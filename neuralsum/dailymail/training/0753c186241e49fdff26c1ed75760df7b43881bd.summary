the shambles surrounding @entity1 took a dramatic turn on thursday with the club ’s @entity4 president @entity3 demanding that the @entity7 family spend a final parachute payment worth millions of pounds purely on footballing matters			1
in an open letter to chairman @entity7 and majority shareholder @entity11 , which has been seen by @entity13 , @entity14 – who owns a 20 per cent stake in the club – also accuses the @entity7 family of paying themselves tens of millions of pounds			1
the @entity4 businessman then insists that the @entity21 put their final parachute payment of between £ 8m and £ 9m - which is due soon from the @entity24 , along with £ 3.5m in tv money from the @entity26 - into a joint account which can only be spent on footballing matters			0
money man : @entity1 president @entity3 has taken exception at how the @entity30 's are running the club put football first : @entity33 wants @entity7 , pictured , to use the club 's final parachute payment on signings in the letter , @entity33 , whose funds helped to sign players such as @entity40 as the @entity41 earned a surprise promotion to the top flight in 2010 under @entity44 , reveals that @entity11 failed to respond to a recent invite to meet him to discuss his concerns			1
@entity3 writes : ‘ @entity47 and @entity7 , since @entity1 were promoted to the @entity24 you have paid yourself more than £ 11.5m in salaries and , in addition , more than £ 24m via interest - free loans to your various companies , all without my approval			2
‘ at the same time we have seen the squad that @entity44 put together with my assistance , and which richly entertained all true football fans , dismantled with our beloved club nearly being relegated from the @entity60 last season			0
‘ i am alarmed to see that only two weeks before the start of the season , we are in the unacceptable position of only having eight registered players and little sign of the @entity24 parachute payments being spent where they should be , on the team , the stadium and training ground			2
‘ now it is time to pay back what you have taken and finally " @entity73 "			0
in the name of @entity1 , i kindly ask you to deposit all remaining incoming @entity24 and @entity26 funds into a public escrow account in our joint names and only release these funds for the purpose of creating a competitive football team			0
’ unhappy : @entity3 has written a letter to @entity47 and @entity7 wanting them out of @entity85 maestro : @entity40 was signed using @entity33 's money and later sold for a large profit contrasting fortunes : @entity44 led @entity1 to the @entity24 , but @entity90 will struggle to keep them in the championship @entity92 : @entity93 left @entity85 on a free transfer this summer in order to enhance his career @entity1 ’s first @entity26 game is at @entity98 a fortnight on saturday			1
they currently only have eight players signed on , as new manager @entity90 and @entity7 have been locked in a stand - off over transfer targets			1
the embarrassing scenario was emphasised earlier on thursday when non-league @entity104 had to call off a friendly against @entity1 on saturday because the @entity60 club had ‘ failed to confirm ’ the fixture			0
@entity7 did not respond to @entity13 enquiries on thursday			2
limited numbers : @entity1 's wesbite shows the team having only eight players registered in the squad lacking numbers : @entity1 have been forced to take on a number of trialists in order to complete fixtures @entity1 appoint @entity118			0
