by @entity0 just over one year ago , @entity1 was a mother - of - two living with her grandparents and working in a food stall at the front of their home			1
but the 21 - year - old from @entity8 - a province about 80km south of @entity10 - now finds herself the face of an international row over the legality and ethics of the business of surrogacy in @entity17 after it was revealed she was a surrogate for an @entity20 couple who allegedly abandoned one of the babies when they returned home			1
ms @entity1 claims @entity25 and @entity26 , from @entity27 in @entity28 , did not want seven - month - old baby @entity29 when they found he had down syndrome and took only his twin sister			1
her @entity34 account also reveals more about her life - dozens of selfies taken alongside her family , including her husband and @entity29 - and what appears to be messages suggesting she was trying to scout for other surrogate mothers			1
but his son has defended his father , telling the @entity60 that it was ' heartbreaking ' his father 's dark past was being revisited			2
previous media reports suggested the @entity65 ' chosen surrogate , @entity1 , lived in an impoverished @entity17 village , but ms @entity1 actually rents and lives in a unit complex in an industrial area in @entity8			1
her grandparents live at the food stall , which is nearby , and ms @entity1 works a few days per month - where she cooks and cleans with her grandmother - but rents a unit in the complex with her husband for 2,200 baht per month , which equates to $ 74			1
my @entity1 was paid a total of $ 16,000 by the @entity20 couple to give birth to the baby			2
her grandparents 's stall where she works occasionally makes roughly $ 300 a month			2
the unit is basic with one bedroom and one bathroom , but it is her own place and a step up from the home she was sharing with her grandparents , husband and two children			1
ms @entity1 's @entity34 page is littered with photos of @entity96 ( left ) and her husband ( right ) some locals , who have bought ice cream from another portable vendor , stop in front of ms @entity1 's grandparents ' stall ms @entity1 grew up at her grandparent 's home and the family has been living there for about 20 years the house is locked up with a metal front gate but no door			1

they were unsure where her eldest children were staying , but they have been seen at the hospital and also with ms @entity1 visiting her unit			1
a small dog sits out the front of the stall next to a bowl filled with water and another half - filled with rice , but it is unclear who is feeding it			2
at the front of the house are tables with baskets filled with plates , glasses and pots for cooking			0
there is also a gas bottle stove and bottles of condiments to go with the @entity17 salads the stall normally serves , which cost between 30 and 40 baht ( $ 1 to $ 1.30 )			2

the unit complex ms @entity1 lives in with her children part of the time , who also often live with her grandparents ( pictured is her neighbour ) for 2,200 baht a month , the unit would have one bedroom and one bathroom ms @entity1 's landlord at the unit complex , who wished to remain anonymous , told @entity124 she had moved in just over a year ago ms @entity1 's landlord at the unit complex , who wished to remain anonymous , told @entity124 she had moved in just over a year ago			1
