' and i believe , for one , that this is unacceptable behavior			0
i know the standards in the community are the same			0
we are @entity8 , @entity9			0
we do not tolerate this level of cruelty , of callous disregard for the dignity of humanity			0
' @entity40 said the video did n't come to the attention of police until february 8			2

attack : the young man , left , is verbally abused by another male , right , who makes him strip off his clothes as punishment for a debt of $ 20 his father owed humiliation : the 21 - year - old stands naked in the streets of @entity8 and then is set upon by the male with a belt the victim 's father apparently owed someone $ 20 , prompting the beating , and the group took $ 10 from the young man , @entity40 said			1
he suffered welts and abrasions from the lashing but did not require hospitalization , @entity40 said			0

but it is a subculture of violence and crime that we have to address			0
it 's not just here in @entity8			0
' @entity17 and @entity40 said they were disturbed that no one reported the beating back in august			2
' when you witness something like this , stand up and speak up , ' @entity17 said			0
