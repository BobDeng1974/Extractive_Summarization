@entity0 told sir @entity1 ' we need f * * * * * * more from you ' in furious row that led to @entity6 leaving @entity7 @entity0 admits he headbutted @entity7 team - mate @entity8 and gave him a black eye during alcohol - fuelled fight in @entity12 @entity0 says he would n't have missed a drugs test like @entity14 and @entity7 suffered as a result @entity0 has re-opened his feud with former @entity18 defender @entity17			1
the @entity7 legend notoriously fouled @entity17 in 2001 , which his first autobiography claimed was an act of vengence after @entity17 had wrongly claimed @entity0 was playacting after injuring his cruciate ligament when tackling @entity17 , then of @entity25 , in 1997			1
now @entity0 's new book - published this week , reveals he does not feel sorry over the incident			1
' there are things i regret in my life and he 's not one of them , ' said @entity0			1
@entity7 midfielder @entity0 ( right ) lunges towards @entity18 's @entity34 ( left ) @entity0 's right boot smashes into the knee of @entity37 during the @entity39 derby in 2001 @entity0 was shown a red card for his terrible tackle on @entity37 at @entity42 @entity17 is sent crashing to the ground as @entity0 begins to move away after the incident @entity0 stands over @entity37 and shouts at him following his thigh - high lunge on the defender @entity0 was banned for five matches and fined £ 150,000 after an @entity49 inquiry into the initial quotes , but reveals in his latest words he was hurt by those charges			1
in his first autobiography , @entity0 wrote : ' i 'd waited long enough			1
i f * * * * * * hit him hard			1
the ball was there ( i think )			1
take that you c * * *			1
and do n't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries			1
' later @entity0 said : ' the charges hurt me - the idea i 'd bragged ... in hope of selling extra books			1
' like our @entity7 facebook page			1
' once we were at @entity65 – they were playing @entity66			1
we were standing at the corner flag and @entity68 ( @entity69 ) was next to me			1
he goes : " this is great is n’t it ? "			2
i went : " i used to play in these games @entity68 "			2
i was n’t being cocky			2
' it ’s about justification , what you stand for			2
when i was at @entity7 i was getting paid good money but i could go : " yeah , but i 'm giving it back to you "			2
i did n’t feel that way with this tv work			2
it ’s an easy gig			2
i do n’t like easy gigs			0
when i heard : " i liked your commentary last night "			0
i knew i was only talking bulls * * * like the rest of them			0
hopefully my bulls * * * was a bit better			0
i wanted to do something that excited me			0
tv work did n’t excite me			0
' i liked @entity68 and @entity93 , though			0
what i really enjoyed was the company			0
i liked meeting people , old players like @entity98 ’s @entity97			0
some @entity7 fans saw us together and one of them said : “ why the f * * * are you talking to him ? ”			0
i felt like saying : “ i will speak to who i f * * * ing want to ! " ' ' i wonder about the current @entity7 dressing room			0
when a manager like sir @entity1 is replaced the new man needs a helping hand			0
does that mean every player should like him ? no. ' but i look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better			0
not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best			0
' looking at what happened to @entity119 , i can only conclude that he did n’t have a strong dressing room			0
he had a weak dressing room			0
' @entity0 fouls @entity17 during a game in 1997 but ended up tearing his anterior cruciate ligament @entity17 and @entity0 both tumble to the ground after the challenge from the @entity7 man @entity130 abuses keane as he lays on the @entity132 pitch with a serious knee injury @entity0 speaks about the incident with @entity17 in his new autobiography @entity136 @entity0 : @entity136 , published by @entity137 and @entity138 , £ 20			1
