by @entity0 it does n't take much to get the so - called @entity2 riled up			0
every day @entity4 users around the world are virtually guaranteed to get upset about a particular subject and take to the social network to voice their views			0
researchers in @entity10 wanted to test how much influence these ' @entity4 storms ' have on public opinion - and whether this opinion can be easily swayed			1
they discovered that not only will a dominant view eventually take over , once public opinion has been set it is almost impossible to change			2
@entity10 researchers downloaded 6 million tweets and filtered them based on topics			1
they concluded that public opinion evolves rapidly on @entity4 before a dominant opinion takes over			1
once this public opinion stablises , the researchers said it was hard to reverse the research was carried out by @entity26 and professor @entity27 from @entity28			1
they downloaded around 6 million tweets and ran these tweets through a computer algorithm to sort them into topics , including tweets about the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 2			1
each tweet was then analysed to establish the underlying sentiments of the user , and whether these sentiments evolved over time			0
@entity26 and @entity27 discovered that public opinion on @entity4 often evolves rapidly and levels off quickly into an ordered state in which one opinion remains dominant			1
' once public opinion stabilises , it 's difficult to change , ' @entity26 added			2

@entity26 and @entity27 discovered public opinion on @entity4 often evolves rapidly and levels off quickly into an ordered state in which one opinion remains dominant			1
this consensus is often driven by the endorsements of larger groups , which tend to have the most influence			0
since public opinion levels off and evolves into an ordered state within a relatively short time , small advantages of one opinion in the early stages of an online discussion turn into a bigger advantage during the evolution of the general opinion , @entity26 said			1
' once public opinion stabilises , it 's difficult to change , ' he added			2
the public opinion for each topic fluctuated in the early stages of a @entity4 discussion , as shown in this chart , before levelling off			2
ultimately , the public opinion evolved into an ordered state with one dominant view however , the work additionally revealed that when dominant opinions emerge they tend not to achieve complete consensus			1
in fact , @entity26 said when @entity4 users who hold minority views are faced with overwhelming opposition , they are still unlikely to change their opinions			0
this was bolstered by the fact @entity4 users overall are more likely to want to change the opinions of others than to admit to changes of their own			0
the findings were published in the journal @entity97 , and the tweets were all posted during the first six months of 2011			0
according to @entity26 and @entity100 , these revelations could be used to shape how political candidates run their social media campaigns , or influence the way companies market their goods and services			0
' by focusing on a network application , candidates or companies can analyse the characteristics and behaviour patterns of their supporters and protesters to explore whether the measures they take can influence public opinion and which opinion may succeed , ' @entity26 said .			2

researchers downloaded 6 million tweets to get a random *sampling* of data
this data was *narrowed* based on a range of topics and *keywords*
the study discovered public opinion on @entity4 evolves rapidly
it then levels off into an ordered state in which one opinion stays dominant
once this public opinion stablises , researchers said it was hard to reverse
