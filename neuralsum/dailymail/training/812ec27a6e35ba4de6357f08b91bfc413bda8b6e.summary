by @entity0 published : 02:43 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 08:02 est , 20 may 2013 foul language and inappropriate themes on @entity5 ’s @entity4 and other pre-watershed programmes are robbing children of their innocence , headteachers have warned			1
adult issues including prostitution , rape , alcoholism and murder are now commonplace on screens before 9pm			1
this is having a ‘ detrimental effect ’ on children , according to a motion passed overwhelmingly at the @entity17 of @entity19 conference in @entity20			1
@entity5 ’s @entity4 , which featured 71 - year - old pensioner @entity23 earlier this month singing a song shortly after 8pm called ‘ @entity25 ’ , was singled out for criticism			1
music mogul @entity27 also kissed the bottom of fellow judge @entity29			2
controversial : @entity27 plants a big kiss on @entity29 's bottom during during an episode of @entity32 's @entity4 earlier this month @entity33 , the head of @entity35 in @entity36 , told delegates children are being forced to grow up too quickly			1
lyrics : @entity40 , 71 , who performing under the name @entity23 , sang the words ' you were lying there butt naked with a woman between your thighs ' on @entity48 ‘ completely inappropriate ’ material that no person ‘ with an ounce of morality ’ would want their child to see were being shown too early			1
speaking about the ' @entity25 ' incident , she said : ' the producers of @entity5 ’s @entity4 obviously think it ’s okay			1
they made a conscious decision to air that performance before the watershed last saturday , ’ she said			2
the programme had already been criticised recently for featuring a lap dancer and an 11 - year - old singing a sexually charged song called @entity67 , both seen by 13 million people before the watershed			2
popular soaps were also a bad influence , mrs @entity33 said , with @entity73 character @entity72 using bad language in an episode broadcast at 7.20pm			1
referring to a recent @entity77 survey which found parents believe childhood now ends at age 12 , she added : ‘ it ’s even lower than that for some children			2
‘ the toxic combination of sophisticated marketing , the media ratings war and added peer pressure linked to social media , means that not only are children being put under pressure to conform to idealistic nonsense but they are also being subjected to adult themes at a much younger age			2
’ she described having to speak to 11 - year - olds about making crude language in the playground			0
‘ what does seem to be new is the freedom that the media have to introduce themes to our children that are completely inappropriate - rape , murder , domestic abuse , child abuse , self - harming , bulimia , alcoholism , prostitution , drug abuse - all on television in the last 12 months and all before the watershed , ’ mrs @entity33 warned			1
‘ surely an easy way to judge if a theme is appropriate would be to ask the question “ is this something i would like my child to know about ? ” ’ another headteacher described how children as young as eight are putting themselves at risk by setting up @entity118 pages			1
risks : headteachers also described how children as young as eight are putting themselves at risk by setting up @entity118 pages @entity128 , head of @entity129 in @entity130 , revealed more than two - thirds of 11 - year - olds at his school had set up accounts on the social networking site - despite under - 13s supposedly being banned			0
many were placing sensitive details online , including their names and addresses - which could be seen by predatory paedophiles			0
others are being subjected to cyber-bullying , leaving them suicidal or with eating disorders , he said in a briefing prior to the conference in @entity20			0
‘ we had a purge just before @entity150 when we wrote to the parents telling them their children were not old enough , ’ said mr @entity128			0
‘ we told them “ do something or we will ”			0
then , a couple of months later , we found they had set up new accounts under a different name			0
’ @entity118 did remove under - age accounts when alerted to them , he said , ‘ but they do n’t make it difficult to set them up ’			0
mr @entity164 confirmed the problem was ‘ rife ’ , saying a ‘ majority of schools ’ were now having to tackle the problem			0
a @entity118 spokesman said : ‘ ultimately , we believe that communication between parents and young people about their use of the internet is vital			0
