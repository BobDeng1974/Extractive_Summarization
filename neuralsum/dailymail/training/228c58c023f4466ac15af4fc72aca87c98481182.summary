by @entity0 published : 13:11 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 07:58 est , 20 september 2013 @entity2 will be buried under a raised tomb made out of @entity5 limestone , cathedral chiefs have announced			0
@entity6 said it wanted the tomb to have links that would reflect the last of @entity11 's @entity10 kings and the stone will be quarried close to where the king grew up			1
the news comes amid a legal challenge by distant relatives of the @entity18 , who have questioned the decision to make @entity21 the final resting place for his remains			1
the @entity23 , the very reverend @entity24 ( centre ) and @entity26 @entity27 ( right ) pose with plans for the tomb of @entity2 in @entity6 plans for the raised tomb , which will be carved out of finely worked @entity32 fossil limestone and feature a deep carved cross , will now be submitted to planning officials for a final decision			1
the limestone is quarried in @entity32 , @entity5 , near to @entity37 , where @entity2 underwent his boyhood training in knighthood and later made his home			0
set within the cathedral 's chancel , the £ 1.3 million project will see the tomb placed on a floor inlaid with a large @entity10 white rose			1
the name of the @entity18 , his date of birth and death , along with his personal motto loyaulte me lie ( loyalty binds me ) and his boar badge will also be carved into a dark circular band around the tomb			1
the project will also see changes to internal layout , windows and lighting in the cathedral			0
flowers are laid on the planned site for the tomb of the king in @entity6			1
the news of the design for the tomb comes amid a legal challenge by distant relatives of the king , who have questioned the decision to make @entity21 the final resting place for his remains @entity2 ( pictured ) was killed at the @entity75 in 1485 bringing to a close the period of @entity11 history known as the @entity79 the plans revealed today will now be reviewed by the @entity81 for @entity11 , with a decision expected later this month			1
if all goes to plan , the cathedral hopes the king 's remains can be re-interred in a ceremony full of pomp next year			1
but the plans also rely on the outcome of a legal challenge from a group of distant relatives of the king , who call themselves the @entity92			1
they have applied to the @entity94 for a judicial review into the decision to grant the city cathedral licence as the final resting place for the @entity18 's remains and want to see the remains placed in @entity10 , where @entity2 had strong links			1
@entity2 's remains were discovered by archaeologists from the @entity103 after a dig in a city centre car park following a campaign by the @entity107 and with the permission of @entity109 , which owned the plot of ground			2
the @entity23 , @entity112 , said : ' we fully respect the process of the @entity115 which will ensure the procedure leading to the re-interment is correct			0
' while this takes its course , we must , as would any @entity6 in this position , seek planning permission for the detailed and costly changes which need to be made to the building			2
@entity2 's remains ( pictured ) were discovered by archaeologists from the @entity103 after a dig in a city centre car park following a campaign by the @entity107 and with the permission of @entity109 , which owned the plot of ground ' the overall concept is regal and respectful in its elegant simplicity , as befits the final resting place of a king of @entity11			1
' by placing the tomb in our chancel , we are giving king @entity2 the same honour as did those friars more than 500 years ago			2
' @entity2 was killed at the @entity75 in 1485 bringing to a close the tumultuous period of @entity11 history known as the @entity79			2
@entity2 not only had a hunchback but he also suffered from roundworm infection , research recently revealed			0
scientists found roundworm eggs in a soil sample taken from the pelvis of the skeleton of the king			0
since the body of @entity2 was found , scientists have been undertaking careful analysis of the remains , in an attempt to shed further light on the attributes and history of the controversial king			2
a team of researchers led by dr @entity164 , of the @entity165 at the @entity166 , used a powerful microscope to examine soil samples taken from the skeleton ’s pelvis and skull , as well as from the soil surrounding the grave			0
the microscope revealed multiple roundworm eggs in the soil sample taken from the pelvis , where the intestines would have been situated in life			0
however , there was no sign of eggs in soil from the skull and very few eggs in the soil that surrounded the grave , suggesting that the eggs found in the pelvis area resulted from a genuine roundworm infection during his life , rather than from external contamination by the later dumping of human waste in the area			0
dr @entity164 said : ' we would expect nobles of this period to have eaten meats such as beef , pork and fish regularly , but there was no evidence for the eggs of the beef , pork or fish tapeworm			0
this may suggest that his food was cooked thoroughly , which would have prevented the transmission of these parasites			0
' dr @entity212 , lecturer in human bioarchaeology at the @entity103 , said : ' despite @entity2 ’s noble background , it appears that his lifestyle did not completely protect him from intestinal parasite infection , which would have been very common at the time			0

@entity6 designed the tomb to reflect the last of @entity11 's @entity10 kings as the stone will be quarried close to where the king grew up
the name of the @entity18 , his date of birth and death , along with his personal motto and his boar badge will also be carved into a band around the tomb
the design was revealed amid a legal challenge by distant relatives of the @entity18 , who have questioned the decision to see his remains rest in @entity21
