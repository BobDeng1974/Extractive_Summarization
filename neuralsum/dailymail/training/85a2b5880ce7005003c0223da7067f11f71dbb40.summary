by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 02:50 est , 15 june 2012 scientists say modern relationships are partly to blame , picture posed by model the stress of family breakdown could be to blame for girls starting puberty at the age of ten , according to scientists			1
the average age at which girls start growing breast tissue has fallen over the past 15 years and it usually begins when they are still at primary school			1
this is thought to be caused by a hormone imbalance , which in turn has been linked to a number of factors , including rising levels of obesity			0
however , experts are increasingly concerned that the strain of modern relationships may also be a key factor			0
professor @entity25 , of @entity26 said the trend towards broken families and absent fathers could be triggering the hormone imbalance			1
he said long - term stress could also be caused by the higher expectations put on girls to achieve at school and fit in with the crowd			0
studies have shown breast development – the first sign of puberty – begins on average at the age of ten , which is five years earlier than during the 19th century			2
doctors say the risks of this include premature sexualisation of young girls and teenage pregnancy			1
it is also linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in later life			0
professor @entity25 , group leader at the @entity53 , told the @entity54 yesterday : ‘ we are seeing early puberty in situations which we would deem stressful for girls , for example being adopted or growing up without their biological father in the house			1
' there may be a stepfather or the child is having to live in two homes			0
that is all somewhat stressful and it is much more common nowadays than it was			0
higher levels of child obesity is another key factor identified as a reason to earlier onset puberty ‘ it may even be that it is all the expectations of the modern world on girls , because there ’s been a radical change in what their expectations are			2
’ two years ago a study by @entity87 researchers found girls of all backgrounds whose fathers had left home were 2.4 times as likely to develop breasts at a younger age			1
many began at nine and some as young as seven , according to a study of 440 girls by the @entity98			0
one explanation is to do with overproduction of the male hormone androgen – which girls naturally produce during puberty – but could be produced in higher quantities and earlier due to stress			2
professor @entity25 said that researchers are looking at ‘ societal factors ’ to explain why breast development is getting earlier , while menstruation is not			0
breast tissue and body hair are the first stages of puberty , followed by menstruation , but the average age for girls to start their period has been 12 - and - a - half since the 1960s			1
professor @entity25 said it was difficult to establish exactly how different hormones were interacting to trigger early breast development			0
dr @entity122 , of @entity123 , also speaking at the festival , said : ‘ we need to help parents deal with the physical and psychological consequences of early puberty which are very serious and can very distressing for the child			2
‘ there is a strong link with early onset of sexual activity when they are not emotionally ready , and with teenage pregnancy for which already have the highest level in @entity139			1

broken homes , stress and obesity behind girls entering puberty earlier than ever
@entity87 study finds girls with absent fathers are 2.4 times more likely to develop breast tissue at a younger age
' strong link ' between early puberty and early onset of sexual activity and teenage pregnancy
