by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:17 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 11 march 2013 @entity2 attempts to split the coalition are in tatters tonight after the government agreed on an unprecedented fudge to spare the @entity7 ’ blushes			1
ministers spent the day thrashing out a way to prevent @entity12 ’s party from having to vote against his treasured mansion tax policy in a @entity15 vote being held by @entity2 tomorrow			1
instead the @entity16 and @entity7 will back an unprecedented amendment which admits @entity18 and mr @entity12 are at loggerheads over the proposal to impose a levy on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
coalition split : @entity18 , pictured today leaving @entity24 , is opposed to an ' intrusive ' @entity25 but @entity12 ( right ) wants the levy on homes worth more than £ 2million this morning @entity7 business secretary @entity27 hinted he would back @entity2 ’s motion which called for ‘ a mansion tax on properties worth over £ 2million , to fund a tax cut for millions of people on middle and low incomes ’			1
but he backtracked tonight , insisting he could now support the government line			0
the coalition amendment , agreed just hours before the deadline set by @entity15 officials , states that the government has cut taxes for low and middle earners while ’ at the same time increasing taxes on the wealthy , including raising stamp duty on expensive properties and restricting tax reliefs ’			1
but in a highly unusual move , it goes on to admit that the governing parties can not agree on targeting properties owned by the super-rich			0
it ’ notes that both parts of the @entity23 continue to support tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes ... [ and it ] notes the part of the coalition led by the deputy prime minister also advocates a @entity25 on properties worth more than £ 2million , as set out in his party ’s manifesto , and the part of the coalition led by the prime minister does not advocate a @entity25 ’			2
a senior @entity7 source said the compromise was an ' ingenious solution ' because neither coalition party wanted to publicly back @entity2 in a @entity15 vote			1
the @entity7 want to target high value properties , like these flats in @entity73 , but have been rebuffed by the @entity16 mr @entity27 said tonight that the @entity7 had refused to support a @entity2 motion ' designed exclusively to play cynical party political games '			1
he added : ’ parties should be judged on what they deliver on fairer taxes , rather than what they say about them			0
in government , @entity2 refused to back our mansion tax			2
’ in @entity81 , @entity2 rubbished the @entity7 policy of a mansion tax			1
in @entity86 , they have simply copied it exactly in an attempt to fill in their blank piece of paper where original policies should be			0
’ but the move attracted ridicule from @entity2			2
party politics : labour leader @entity96 ( right ) and shadow chancellor @entity97 are seeking to exploit coalition tensions with tomorrow 's vote shadow treasury minister @entity101 said : ’ it would be astonishing if the @entity7 failed to back a straightforward motion supporting their long - held policy of a mansion tax on properties over £ 2 million			1
’ the @entity7 have a simple choice – either they back the policy they set out in their manifesto and which @entity12 made the centrepiece of the @entity111 or they do n’t			2
no amount of wriggling or contortion can get them out of that simple choice			0
’ the @entity16 have remained implacably opposed to the idea of an extra annual tax on homes worth more than £ 2million			0
@entity24 today said @entity18 and @entity118 believe the levy would ‘ be intrusive , expensive to levy , raise little and the temptation for future chancellors to bring ever more homes into its net would be irresistible ’			1
business secretary @entity27 drew up the @entity7 policy on a mansion tax and said tonight the @entity7 had refused to support a @entity2 motion ' designed exclusively to play cynical party political games ' the @entity2 motion has been lifted from @entity7 policy , piling pressure on mr @entity12 ’s 57 mps to side with mr @entity96			1
the @entity7 want to target high value properties but have been rebuffed by the @entity16			2
the mansion tax was a @entity7 manifesto commitment at the last election and is being advocated by mr @entity12 and mr @entity27 in the current @entity138 negotiations			1
it would involve an annual one per cent levy on homes worth more than £ 2 million			0
owners would pay the tax on the value of their home above £ 2 million			0
someone living in a £ 3 million property would pay £ 10,000 a year			0
but @entity24 warned @entity7 ministers they could not vote for the @entity2 motion			1
mr @entity18 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ the prime minister will expect , as always , government ministers to support the government in all votes			0
’ he added : ‘ the prime minister 's view ( on a mansion tax ) is the same as the chancellor 's , which he set out at the end of last year			0
‘ the chancellor said then that it was intrusive , expensive to levy and raises little and that the temptation for future chancellors to bring ever more homes into its net would be irresistible			2
’ asked if mr @entity18 had discussed the vote with mr @entity12 , he said : ‘ they talk about a wide number of things			0
i 'm sure they also discussed this , yes			0
’ only this morning , mr cable , who drew up the @entity7 policy on a mansion tax , hinted he was minded to vote with @entity2			1
he said he had not seen the wording of the motion – which was published on friday – but he would examine it before deciding how to vote			0
‘ we ’ll certainly have a look at it , ’ he told @entity181			0
‘ we did come to this five years go and we did set out the logic behind it and how it would practically operate and @entity2 had an opportunity in government to do it , did n’t do it , we ’re now three years into the next @entity191 , they ’ve finally alighted on it , and if it is a real commitment , i would certainly welcome that			2

@entity2 try to engender @entity23 split by forcing commons vote on imposing a levy on high value homes
but government refuses to play *parliamentary* games and draws up unprecedented amendment admitting coalition is at loggerheads
policy was first put forward by @entity7 @entity27
tories say the idea would be ' intrusive and expensive '
