by @entity0 @entity1 has broken his silence on the reasons behind the sacking of @entity5 and insists the @entity7 dressing room will be better off without him			1
the @entity7 captain , frustrated by the @entity10 ’s insistence that he still can not give his full side of the story for legal reasons , was at least able yesterday to back the decision to part with the gifted maverick in an attempt to restore team unity			1
@entity1 was careful in what he said at the @entity20 media day but he realised it would be foolhardy if he ducked the opportunity to have his say on @entity5 with feelings running high in @entity26 cricket after a winter of utter discontent			1
that did not stop @entity5 's wife , former pop star @entity30 , responding on @entity31 to @entity1 's assertion that the decision took ' guts '			1
fighting his corner : @entity7 captain @entity1 insists sacking @entity5 during the @entity37 tour of @entity38 was the ' right decision ' fractured : @entity1 is still unable to tell the full story of @entity5 's dismissal because of legal wranglings outburst : @entity5 's wife @entity30 took to @entity31 after @entity1 's words ‘ i know it was the right decision , ’ insisted @entity1 at @entity45 when asked about the @entity5 sacking			1
‘ it was a brave call and it took a lot of guts to make it but people have been talking about it as if it just happened overnight			2
‘ the last thing that was intended was making @entity5 a scapegoat for what happened in @entity38			1
that ’s not how it was at all			2
' there comes a time when you do have to say ‘ right , this is what we want moving forward ’ and that was the decision taken			2
to say it was almost a call made by the toss of a coin is very wrong and disrespectful to the guys who made it			0
‘ a lot of effort went into getting him back in the side in the first place in 2012 and a lot of effort and thought went into the decision that has been made now			0
’ end game : @entity5 walks off after being dismissed during the fourth @entity80 in @entity81			1
@entity7 lost the series 5 - 0 centre stage : @entity1 lines up with his @entity20 teammates during the county 's official photo call in @entity45 ahead of the forthcoming @entity89 season the mention of 2012 was , of course , extremely relevant as that was when @entity1 , along with @entity93 , decided to give @entity5 one final chance despite the hurt and outrage caused by the text messages he sent to @entity99 players criticising and insulting the then @entity7 captain @entity100			1
@entity5 , who was suspended before returning to the @entity7 team in @entity102 , was given a final written warning and @entity104 understands his behaviour deteriorated so much towards the end of the disastrous @entity37 winter that the @entity10 now have a four - page dossier full of his various misdemeanours			1
the presence of that document meant that @entity111 , the new @entity7 managing director , was faced with a ‘ no brainer ’ of a decision to jettison @entity5 but it is the @entity10 ’s questionable public relations policy since then that has seen flak thrown at the likes of @entity1 and @entity93 without the public knowing the full story			1
the captain insists that they will find out very soon			2
defeated : @entity5 and @entity1 walk off in dismay after @entity7 are defeated by @entity38 on the fourth day of the fourth test at the @entity122 explanation : @entity1 insisted that the full version of events surrounding @entity5 's sacking will emerge in due course ‘ i ca n’t answer questions about @entity5 fully at the moment which is incredibly frustrating for me but there are a number of reasons why he went which will become clear , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ i know people will keep asking me about it but i hope everyone will understand the situation i ’m in until we can give the answers			0
at the moment i just ca n’t			0
‘ if anyone thinks the decision was taken lightly without a lot of consideration and thought they ’re wrong			0
a lot went into it and it was a tough decision			0
’ @entity1 understands the need for the full story to come out sooner rather than later because , like @entity151 ’s ghost at the feast , @entity5 will always be in the background this summer haunting @entity7 while a legal gagging order prevails			1
happier times : @entity1 is applauded by @entity5 and raises his bat after scoring a century against @entity157 in @entity158 in march 2010 the confidentiality agreement signed by the @entity10 and @entity5 to cover the terms of his severance package expires at the end of september but for the good of all involved @entity7 need to find a way of fronting up fully before then			1
the captain , who now has a chance to build a team in his own image and prove his strength as a leader , is adamant that the dressing room will be better now without @entity5 as @entity7 attempt to rebuild from the desperate depths they have plumbed , culminating in the final indignity of defeat by @entity176			1
‘ yes , moving forward that will be the way , ’ said @entity1 when asked if the dressing room will now be a better place			1
‘ we all know how important team culture and unity are			0
we are in a results driven business but sometimes you have to get the basics in place first			0
i understand why the @entity10 have taken the stance they have but i just hope people can be patient with our explanation			0
’ contrast : @entity1 and @entity192 stand dejected as they watch @entity38 collect the @entity194 in @entity195 back in january following a 5 - 0 whitewash success : three years earlier , @entity100 and @entity1 celebrate after @entity7 's 3 - 1 series win over australia in the 2010 - 2011 series when @entity1 returned from @entity38 after the successful @entity37 tour in 2011 , with the small matter of @entity203 runs to his name , he was a hero			1
now things could not be more different and the captain has the biggest challenge of his career to put right the wrongs of a disastrous six months			2
‘ when you lose 5 - 0 it ’s almost as if people ca n’t bear to look at you and you feel embarrassed about it , ’ @entity1 admitted			2
‘ but it can happen when you play sport at the highest level and , even though i do n’t want to use the word cyclical , sometimes that ’s what it is			0
' when you do n’t do yourself justice as a player it ’s hugely frustrating			0
sometimes the harder you try the worse it gets but that ’s sport and it ’s how you bounce back from those moments that defines you			0
‘ there have been times when i ’ve struggled for runs and other times when i ’ve found batting quite easy and i ’ve been working very hard on my game in the last month and hopefully i ’ll see the rewards of that			0
’ at home : cook in front of the @entity242 sign in @entity45 during the club 's media open day on tuesday make it snappy : @entity1 and @entity246 turn the camera on the photographers @entity1 will begin his own quest for form for @entity20 against @entity251 at @entity252 ’s next week , providing all is well with the imminent arrival of his first child			1
he knows both him and @entity7 face a long journey back			2
‘ it is a new start , it has to be , and we have an opportunity now to begin again , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ that does n’t mean we ’re going to guarantee lots of good results because that ’s not how sport works			0
' we have to earn the right to get back where we were and we might have to do that with a totally different side			0
‘ @entity93 and @entity100 started out from a similar position to where we are now after we were bowled out for 51 in @entity269 and things take time			0
' we played our best cricket as a side against @entity102 in 2011 and it took two - and - a - half years to build that momentum , learning how to win and with people feeling happy in the side			0
that ’s how long it took to get that side playing to its peak so you ca n’t put a time frame on it			0
' what i do know is that it wo n’t happen overnight and it will take a lot of work			0
’ he may have had the toughest of times and he may be frustrated at not being able to give his side of the @entity5 story but @entity1 remains a cricketer and a man of substance			1
most importantly , he dearly wants what is best for @entity26 cricket and he remains the best man , along with whichever new coach @entity7 choose , to put things right this summer .			2
