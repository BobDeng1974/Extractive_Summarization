thousands of cancer patients will be denied life - prolonging medication after health chiefs decided to axe 21 drugs deemed too expensive for the @entity5			1
the move by the @entity7 will affect almost 8,000 sufferers a year – with the big losers being bowel , breast , lung and prostate patients			1
although the de-listed drugs will remain available for existing patients , doctors will be unable to prescribe them for new sufferers from march			1
the decision has sparked fury among cancer charities and doctors who say thousands will be denied ‘ last chance ’ medication that can give them extra months , if not years , with their loved ones			1
a review carried out by doctors , pharmacists and patients ' representatives has concluded that 25 of the 84 treatments currently offered by the supplementary @entity7 should be dropped launched in april 2011 , the £ 280million - a - year fund has led to around 55,000 patients in @entity34 receiving drugs banned on the @entity5 by rationing body @entity36 for not being value for money			1
the government ’s aim – a @entity43 election pledge – was to enable @entity5 doctors to prescribe any drug they believed could benefit a cancer patient			1
but @entity34 , which took over administration of the fund last year , has found 21 drugs – used in a total of 25 treatments – provide ‘ insufficient value for money ’			1
among them are three breast cancer drugs including @entity55 , @entity56 used in prostate cancer , three bowel cancer medications including @entity59 , and @entity60 for lung cancer			2
critics say the @entity63 lags behind @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 in prescribing life - prolonging medicines to cancer patients and the situation will get worse			2
@entity70 , chief executive of the charity @entity72 , said : ‘ this is bad news for bowel cancer patients			2
‘ it ’s likely that 65 per cent of patients with advanced bowel cancer face the probability of an earlier death by being refused innovative treatments that were available before			2
‘ these changes are a backward step in treatment for advanced bowel cancer			2
@entity84 : made it to her daughter 's wedding ‘ doctors will be forced to tell their patients there are treatments that can prolong their lives but they will no longer be available			1
’ the @entity93 estimates 7,724 patients a year will lose out			0
chief executive @entity95 said both the drug companies and @entity34 ‘ bear responsibility for this mess ’			0
he added : ‘ if the prime minister is serious about his promise to cancer patients , he needs to bring together @entity34 and the drugs companies to broker a deal to protect access to these drugs before the march deadline when patients will be denied treatment			1
’ @entity110 , chief executive at @entity111 , said : ‘ thousands of breast cancer patients have today been denied the chance of improved quality of life and extra time with their loved ones			0
this news is devastating for them			0
‘ the @entity7 is falling apart when there is still no long - term solution in place			1
’ dr @entity124 , consultant clinical oncologist at @entity125 , said that the decision to axe @entity56 was a travesty			0
she added : ‘ as a doctor who treats men with advanced prostate cancer , i am deeply saddened			0
in my everyday experience , @entity56 has given some men with advanced prostate cancer extra time			0
some of the men that i started to treat with @entity56 three to four years ago are still alive today			0
‘ most importantly , this time has been of good quality , allowing them to carry on doing the things they enjoy despite their cancer			0
’ professor @entity143 , chair of the @entity7 , said : ‘ we have been through a robust , evidence - based process to ensure the drugs available offer the best clinical benefit , getting the most for patients from every pound			1
’ but @entity150 , chief executive of the @entity151 , said that the fund remains merely a ‘ sticking plaster ’			2
he added : ‘ @entity34 ’s decision is extremely disappointing and a significant blow to the health and wellbeing of future @entity5 patients			0
’ a @entity160 spokesman said : ‘ we want people to have access to the very latest drugs			0
that is why experts have made decisions to stop routinely funding drugs with limited clinical benefit			0

@entity170 's @entity7 will drop 21 of 84 current treatments

but review carried out by doctors , pharmacists and patient *groups* has concluded 21 of the current treatments should be axed
