by @entity0 published : 14:38 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 21 august 2013 researchers tackling the illegal trafficking of desert chameleons are using barcode scanners like those used in supermarkets to police trade			1
unique @entity9 microchips are being fitted to the six - inch long @entity11 chameleons in the @entity13 desert so their movements can be tracked			1
the chameleons can now be read just like a supermarket barcode when a researcher waves a scanner over them			1
beep beep : researchers are using similar scanners as those used in supermarkets to keep track of desert chameleons @entity28 photographers @entity29 and @entity30 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , documented the unique project while on a trip to @entity35 in west africa			1
a global trade supplying chameleons as pets and to collections exists with around 60,000 animals legally exported from their home countries each year			1
but customs officials trying to show a chameleon is being illegally exported have found proof difficult to come by			2
this is why chameleon expert dr @entity47 , of @entity49 's @entity48 , is fitting the implants with @entity51 , a natural history guide in @entity35			2
the chameleons can now be read just like a supermarket barcode when a researcher waves a scanner over them the chameleons can now be read just like a supermarket barcode when a researcher waves a scanner over them dr @entity47 says the new chips cause no harm to the wild creatures and hopes it will deter the theft of @entity11 chameleons			1
she said : ' we are inserting a tiny metal piece encoded with a barcode with a syringe just under the skin			1
' the chip itself is actually called a @entity78 tag			2
' we have n't seen any side - effects			2
the skin is sterilised before the tag is inserted , and it 's a very small piece , a few millimetres			0
' it would be like having a biggish splinter			0
the small hole is then covered with spray - on skin glue , the stuff you get in pharmacies			0
' the @entity11 is found in arid parts of @entity89 , @entity35 and @entity90			1
@entity28 photographers @entity29 and @entity30 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , documented the unique project the chameleons spend much of their time on the ground or clambering onto sparse , scattered shrubs unlike most of the world 's 160 species of chameleon , the chameleons spend much of their time on the ground or clambering onto sparse , scattered shrubs			1
they have the typical chameleon features of well - developed legs , large , grasping feet , a prehensile tail and mobile , independently - moving eyes on the ends of ' turrets '			0
but its most striking characteristic is the row of large , knobbly tubercles running along a ridge on its back , giving it a zigzag outline reminiscent of a small dragon or dinosaur			0
the chameleons have a surprising turn of speed when required - but with so little ground cover , it is n't particularly difficult for poachers to locate and catch them			2
as a result , policing illegal trade is difficult and traders often falsely declare that chameleons for sale are the descendants of legally - imported specimens			2
tiny : a @entity11 chameleon baby in the @entity13 desert before it was chipped so researchers can keep track of it unless they can be caught in the act of smuggling , the onus is on the authorities to prove the animals have in fact been taken from the wild			1
but this is where microchipping could prove invaluable			0
dr @entity47 said : ' we do know that some @entity11 chameleons were shipped to @entity151 under ' permits ' issued by @entity153			1
' but this was just a ruse , because this species does n't occur in @entity153 , so they have no right to ship or issue these			0
' dr @entity47 hopes the microchipping initiative will also stop valuable data about the behaviour of these little - studied creatures			0
the barcodes could track long term changes in growth , size and weight			0
the researchers will also track the movement of adults and juveniles of both sexes			0
@entity173 of this information exists currently so they hope the data reveals plenty of information about how the species lives			0
barcoding could also determine what sort of range size they need , their survival rates and even population size .			0

microchips are being fitted to @entity11 chameleons in the @entity13 desert
they are read like a supermarket barcode when scanner is waved over them
@entity28 photographers @entity29 and @entity30 captured the project
