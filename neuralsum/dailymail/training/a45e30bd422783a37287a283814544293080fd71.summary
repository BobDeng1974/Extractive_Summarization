there self - typing laces features alongside the time travelling @entity2 ( pictured ) the laces automatically on the trainers tighten when a wearer slips their feet inside them			1
a ‘ presser ’ that ’s hidden in the sole of the shoes , transmits power when a wearer steps on them to the lacing mechanism			1

the inventors of the shoes claim that the ‘ @entity35 auto - lacing system ’ lets people tie their laces without using their hands when their weight automatically engages the system ’s mechanism via the ' presser ' ( pictured ) which is concealed in the shoe 's sole in the heel area the ' puller ' ( pictured ) provides the connection between the tension applied by the mechanism and the direct pressure applied by the lacing			1
the laces are designed to support tension exceeding 250lbs ' the presser serves as a force sensor and transmits this power directly to the lacing mechanism using a very clever , but subtle process , ' according to the @entity131 website			0
the sole of the shoe also conceals the lever and is made from thermo polyurethane to be flexible and absorb stress			0
' the puller ' provides the connection between the tension applied by the mechanism and the direct pressure applied by the lacing			0
