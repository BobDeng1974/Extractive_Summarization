by @entity0 great day : the actor @entity1 , who played lieutenant @entity2 in @entity3 , said he was ' honored to meet 98 - year - old @entity5 veteran lt. colonel			1
amazing man ' it was the retaliatory strike that restored national morale after the staggering shock of @entity14			1
and now the brave @entity16 airmen who carried out the 1942 @entity7 on @entity17 , taking the fight to the heart of @entity20 for the first time , have been honored with the nation 's highest award			1
only four of those 80 pilots are still alive and on @entity26 , lt. col. @entity7 , 98 , accepted the @entity27 on behalf of his comrades			1
' this @entity27 was hard earned and long overdue for a group of heroes who literally turned the tide for @entity16 in the @entity33 , ' said rep. @entity34 , @entity35 , in a statement as lt. col. @entity6 accepted the medal as the grand marshall in monday 's @entity26 parade in @entity40			1
' i 'm proud to have carried the mantle to see these men receive the honor they so richly deserve			0
' @entity6 and his three comrades , who are 94 , 93 and 92 years old were finally honored last week during a ceremony in the @entity47 with president @entity48			1
the @entity7 , led by @entity50 lt. col. @entity49 , launched their audacious retribution from the deck of the aircraft carrier @entity54 in 16 b - 25 bombers on april 18 , 1942			1
approval : president @entity48 signs an act to award a @entity27 to the @entity5 members of the @entity7 in recognition of their military service during @entity62 behind the president is 98 - year - old retired , lt. col. @entity64 - who flew in the raid hero : lt. col. @entity64 , a member of the @entity7 who bombed @entity20 , visits the grave site of lt. col. @entity9 , who he flew with on the bombing mission , buried at @entity70 , in @entity70 , @entity71 , on friday , may 23 , 2014 their one - way mission was to strike @entity17 and @entity20 and restore the badly damaged pride of a nation still reeling from the december 7 , 1941 attack on @entity14 , which cost 2,471 service - men 's lives			1
that attack destroyed the myth of @entity16 impregnability and in the dark months that followed the @entity83 's lightning advances across the @entity84 caused national confidence to plummet			2
president @entity86 demanded an immediate response and it was @entity9 who provided him with one			1
no military operation of this kind had ever been attempted before			0
unprecedented : visible on the deck of the @entity54 are eight of the 16 @entity96 bombers that launched on april 18 , 1942 , to attack @entity17 staggering : an @entity98 b - 25 bomber takes off from the deck of the @entity54 on its way to take part in the first @entity16 air raid on @entity20 in april 1942 one way ticket : an @entity98 @entity96 takes off from the deck of the @entity54 on its way to take part in the first @entity16 air raid on @entity20 , the @entity7 @entity9 wanted to launch huge @entity96 bombers from the deck of an aircraft carrier - stripping the planes of any unnecessary weight , with only enough fuel to clear @entity20			1
from there the planes would carry on to @entity112 , then friendly to the @entity16			0
the @entity113 , unaware of their mission , departed from the @entity54 600 miles east of @entity20			1
a chance encounter with a @entity20 fishing boat , which they destroyed , forced the @entity113 to leave early , meaning they would not have enough fuel to make it to their planned landing zones in @entity112			2
the plan was changed so that the raiders understood they had to traverse enemy territory			0
@entity6 still remembers what @entity9 said about the unprecedented attack before they took off			2
' he said that it was a very dangerous mission			0
@entity128 wanted to back out , they could without any repercussions			0
' no one backed out			0
declaration of war : a ball of flame erupts from gasoline stores or aircraft at the @entity137 at @entity14 , @entity138 on december 7 , 1941			1
base personnel can only watch helplessly as the @entity20 surprise attack destroys much of the area damage to morale : the @entity143 burns after being hit by a @entity20 bomb in @entity14 , december 7 , 1941 once aboard the plane , @entity6 said the crew was silent before take - off			1
@entity9 warned his crew they might not even reach @entity112 after the bombs were dropped			2
@entity6 said that he began to tap out the rhythm to ' the @entity152 ' , a folk song about a train speeding to its destination			0
innovator : @entity16 aviator and military officer @entity49 ( 1896 - 1993 ) , wearing his uniform before he led the first aerial raid on @entity20 in @entity5 he told the @entity160 that @entity9 shot him a look without saying word			1
' i think maybe he thought i 'd gone off the deep end , ' said @entity6			0
after the bombs had been dropped on @entity17 , @entity9 ordered his crews to bail out of their planes at 9,000 feet , at night			1
' for me , that was the scariest time , ' @entity6 said , not knowing whether they would land in the @entity171 or land			0
' i pulled the parachute ripcord so hard , and looking down , that i gave myself a black eye , ' he said to the @entity160			0
@entity6 was left hanging 12 - feet up in a tree 's branches until the morning - when friendly locals rescued him			2
' i started walking west , ' said @entity6 to @entity178			0
' we knew that if we walked west , we would be leaving and getting away from ( @entity20 ) occupied territory			2
' as a result , following the bombing , 15 of the planes crash - landed in rural @entity112 , while the 16th bomber made it to @entity186			2
the @entity113 were aided by @entity189 peasants , thousands of whom were later killed by the @entity20 for their support of the @entity16			2
aftermath : @entity9 with his bombing crew and some @entity189 friends are pictured here in @entity112 , after the airmen bailed out following @entity9 's raid on @entity20 , on april 18 , 1942			1

three of those captured were executed , one died in captivity , and four remained prisoners of war and survived the war			0
the attack , which did not do much damage to @entity20 's munitions factories , shifted momentum in the @entity84 conflict			1
' the @entity20 were completely surprised , ' said colonel @entity225 , 91 , the official @entity113 historian			2
' they did not think the @entity16 had the range for that type of attack			0
' @entity20 brought more troops home to protect the mainland , leaving it vulnerable in the @entity84			1
rejuvenated @entity16 troops took advantage , defeating the @entity20 at the @entity235 two months later , turning the war for good			2
