but drivers who break the speed limit on the @entity11 are in very little danger of being slapped with a fine - because many cameras monitoring the road have allegedly not worked for five years			1
the cameras are behind overhead signs telling motorists to reduce their speed to 60 , 50 or 40mph at certain times - but officials have failed to switch them on since their installation started in 2009			1
restrictions : drivers who break the speed limit on the @entity11 are in very little danger of being slapped with a fine - because many cameras monitoring the road have allegedly not worked for five years the cameras only work on a three - mile section of the 117 - mile @entity11 road between junction 2 and 3 - just south of the @entity31 in @entity32 , reported the @entity33			1
problems have plagued the others - with cameras installed without approval that their images could be used as evidence in court , and monitoring responsibility changing hands between police forces			1
but average speed cameras at roadwork sites operate - and the @entity47 said cameras on sections between junction 10 in @entity51 and 16 in @entity52 will be working by the summer			1
however , the @entity54 ’s executive director , @entity53 , said the fiasco of switched - off cameras was a ‘ cock - up ’ that needed to be resolved			2
he told the @entity33 : ‘ it ’s poor that it ’s gone on for so long			0
it ’s also a waste of money			0
the @entity63 should have a look at this			0
’ in detail : average speed cameras at roadwork sites operate - and the @entity47 said cameras on sections between junction 10 in @entity51 and 16 in @entity52 will be working by the summer a @entity47 spokesman told @entity68 : ' @entity69 where mandatory speed limits are displayed in red rings have continued to work effectively to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flow , and have operated well without fixed camera enforcement			1
' we are working with @entity77 , who are taking responsibility between junctions 10 and 16 , to resume enforcement			0
the speed limits are enforceable by the police and the cameras will be operational by summer 2014			1
' ' it 's poor that it 's gone on for so long			0
it 's also a waste of money ' @entity53 , @entity54 @entity89 , president of @entity90 , added that successive transport secretaries have spoken of changing the speed limits on motorways – which is ‘ ironic ’ considering the speed limit is not enforced on sections of the @entity11			0
@entity97 , from the road safety charity brake , told @entity68 : ‘ speeding kills : the faster you are travelling , the less chance you can stop in time for an emergency , and the more damage you ’ll do in a crash			0
‘ speed cameras are an essential tool for discouraging speeding on motorways , and catching drivers who take this appalling risk			2
‘ it is therefore very concerning that these speed cameras have been left switched off for such a long period , meaning that many drivers who have risked lives by breaking the speed limit will have got away with their dangerous and selfish actions			2

cameras tell drivers to reduce speed to 60 , 50 or 40mph at certain times
but they only work on a three - mile section from junction 2 to 3 in @entity32
cameras installed without approval that images could be used in court
and monitoring responsibility has changed hands between police forces
