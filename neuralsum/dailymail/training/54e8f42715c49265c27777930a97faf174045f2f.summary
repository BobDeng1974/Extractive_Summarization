a family who bought a ' common ' tortoise from a local @entity3 shop were shocked to discover that it was actually a rare giant breed - which has grown to an incredible nine stone			1
the creature was bought fourteen years ago by a couple from @entity8 , who were told that it was an ordinary tortoise			1
but the new owners were unaware that they had bought a special sulcata tortoise - which is the third largest species in the world - and has kept growing and growing			1
giant tortoise : @entity16 is now living at @entity17 after outgrowing his former home huge : @entity19 from @entity17 rescue holds @entity16 the nine - stone giant tortoise who is expected to grow even more and could double in size the animal , which currently weighs nine stone is still getting bigger and could end up weighing 200 pounds ( 14 stone )			1
the tortoise which has been nicknamed @entity32 - after the curmudgeonly tv character from @entity29 show ' @entity30 ' - became too large for the family home and they could no longer cope			1
the frantic couple were then forced to ring around zoos and rescue centres to try and find a suitable home for the giant reptile			1
but no one came forward			0
however , @entity19 , a farmer , offered to step in to rescue @entity16 and brought him home to his reserve in @entity43 , @entity44			1
kind : @entity19 , a farmer is pictured with @entity16 , he says that he rescues around 10 reptiles a week he collected the tortoise for free from the family in @entity8 and added it to his collection of unusual pets - which includes 400 other reptiles			1
@entity19 runs @entity53 , an animal rescue centre which he set up in 2001 , but he also works a 17 - hour day on his farm			1
@entity19 , 47 , said : ' they got @entity16 from a @entity3 shop when he was a baby and they sold him as a common tortoise so they would n’t have known that he would keep growing for as long as he will			1
' they ’d tried a lot of zoos and wildlife sanctuaries but nobody would take him in so they were relieved that i could help out			0
' they were pretty distraught to give him away as @entity16 was a much - loved pet but they ’ve been keeping in regular contact since i picked him up around two weeks ago			1
' i ’ve never seen one like him before and he ’ll need specialist care so i imagine he ’ll end up staying with me for the foreseeable future unless the right person comes forward			2
' @entity16 seems pretty happy bulldozing my garden at the minute and thankfully even though his diet is a bit different to regular tortoises he eats dry grass and hay which i have good access to working on a farm			0
' the @entity83 spurred tortoise ( geochelone sulcata ) , also called the sulcata tortoise , is a species of tortoise which inhabits the southern edge of the @entity91 desert , in northern @entity83			2
the rare creature is expected to live until he is 150 and is and likely to continue to grow for another 35 years			2
however , as hatchlings , they are barely three inches in length			0
sulcata tortoise can be found in countries across the continent including @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 among many others			2
it is the third - largest species of tortoise in the world and the largest species of mainland tortoise not found on an island			1
their natural habitats are grasslands , savannahs and shrublands			0
they are known to burrow into the ground of these dry lands so that they may find moist areas and escape high temperatures			0
its diet consists of many types of grasses and plants , high in fibre and very low in protein			0
the consumption of too much protein can cause their shells to take on a pyramidal appearance			0
the attractive tortoise have a reputation for having a pleasant temperament , and are often brought home as pets			1
but these animals provide significant challenges because they have a specific diet , temperature requirements , and an unusual size			2
he explained that the @entity8 family were ' absolutely distraught ' to give up their prized pet			1
he added : ' the family that had to give him up are absolutely gutted but it was just one of those things			1
' they had bought it as a wedding anniversary present for themselves and were sold it on the basis it was a normal - sized garden tortoise			1
' they were really , really , distraught because they had had him for almost 15 years			0
' their garden was quite small and they were really concerned they were n't going to be able to look after him properly			0
' he measures two foot from head to tail and is about 18 inches side to side			0
he 's about 18 inches tall too			0
he 's only going to get bigger			0
' @entity19 said that @entity16 spends most of his time under a heating lamp in a specially built shed in his garden and had a ' personality of his own '			1
' he will answer to his name and comes to see you if you call him , ' he said			0
' he has a personality of his own , and will bulldoze everything in his way , including you if you 're there			0
' @entity16 , a sulcata tortoise , is expected to live until he is 150 is and likely to continue to grow for another 35 years			2
@entity19 has over 35 years of experience rescuing exotic creatures			2
he looks after tortoises , snakes and lizards at his farm and rescues around 10 reptiles a week			0
he looks after 407 reptiles at his house in @entity44 and has around 20 volunteers who help him out			2
in his spare time , the farmer works with reptile charities , zoos and specialist shops to take care of all his residents and also visits schools with some of them and runs demonstrations			2
he said : ' i really fell into doing this but i have such a passion for it			0
on average , i rescue about 10 reptiles a week and unfortunately only about two of those get rehomed			0
' that ’s because of a lack of people coming forward and also because i have a harsh vetting process as i do n’t want to rehome them and end up taking them back in a few months down the line			0
' @entity19 runs a nationwide free pick - up service and said the furthest he has ever gone to collect a reptile is @entity223 , in @entity224			1
' that was a 15 hour drive there and a 15 hour drive back but i ’d rather do that than see them left with owners who ca n’t look after them , ' he said			0
' i end up paying around £ 700 just in taking care of them each month , which is a financial stretch but i love doing this			2
' if you 'd like to give @entity16 or any other of @entity19 ’s reptiles a new home , please visit : @entity238 .			1
