the @entity0 has released a statement highlighting concerns over the re-emergence of plans to have an overseas game incorporated into the @entity7 season			1
recent reports suggest that the @entity7 are considering the possibility of playing one of the 38 games in the schedule on foreign territory			1
it follows plans that originally surfaced in 2008 of an additional 39th top - flight game , but the prospect was widely condemned and shelved			1
@entity17 celebrates after scoring the second in @entity0 's 2 - 0 win over @entity20 @entity0 fans waiting outside @entity22 for the team bus to arrive ahead of the @entity20 game and now @entity0 has have spoken out against the plans , arguing that it would impact on the integrity of the @entity7			1
they also believe many fans will be left significantly out of pocket , saying that : ' die - hard supporters would want to travel to such games , thereby adding significantly to the several thousand pounds a season they already spend following their teams			0
' read the full statement from @entity0 on overseas @entity7 games below ... the @entity0 board notes with deep concern the re-emergence of the ' overseas @entity7 game ' idea reported in the media			1
we see this concept as fundamentally flawed for a number of reasons and oppose its introduction to top flight football in @entity48			0
the 39th game idea ( an extra @entity7 game to be played overseas ) which was first mooted and widely condemned in 2008 and subsequently shelved by the @entity7 has , inevitably , re-emerged under a new guise , whereby it is apparently proposed that one of the 38 games each @entity7 team plays would be played overseas			1
playing a fixture overseas would inevitably impact on the integrity of the @entity7			1
playing football in a different climate and time zone could potentially impact on a team 's performance			2
' home ' advantage would also disappear , giving those clubs playing a nominal ' away ' game an advantage across the season , as such games would essentially be played on neutral grounds			0
supporters ' season tickets would be devalued as they would decrease in number to eighteen games and for some teams the ' missing ' game would be one of their most attractive fixtures			0
inevitably , die - hard supporters would want to travel to such games , thereby adding significantly to the several thousand pounds a season they already spend following their teams			0
this development would also have a negative impact on match going supporters in the @entity84 who , let us not forget , are the lifeblood of the game			1
while they may no longer be seen as essential to clubs ' income , they play a fundamental part in making the @entity7 the spectacle that it is			1
without full grounds producing fantastic atmospheres week in week out , the @entity7 ' brand ' would be severely weakened			2
furthermore , there would inevitably be an impact on players with yet more mid-season and in most cases , long distance , travel			0
it is also possible to envision a scenario where half - fit stars are encouraged to play in such games to ensure sponsors and local supporters are kept happy			0
there must also be concerns that this is the thin end of the wedge and that , over time , more domestic league games could be played abroad			2
simply because @entity113 ( a single country sport at the professional level ) plays international games at @entity117 does not mean football , already a global game , needs to flaunt itself in the same manner			0
pre or post-season friendlies and small tournaments are the logical formats for overseas matches			0
it is easy to understand the desire of overseas @entity0 supporters ( and sponsors ) to see the team play , but this can not be allowed to interfere with the integrity of the @entity7 , with title races and relegation fights often being settled by a single goal or result			1
there is a difference between friendly matches against strong opposition and competitive games played as part of one of the top leagues in world football that @entity7 clubs would do well to understand			2
it is ironic that the flotation of this unwelcomed idea has arisen during the ' leaders in @entity154 ' conference currently taking place at @entity22			0
if football had leaders who actually understood the game 's history and the need for competitive integrity they would take the opportunity to kill this idea once and for all			1
it is probably naive to expect @entity0 or other clubs to make a statement at this stage on something that is clearly being discussed behind closed doors			2
it is to be hoped however , that if this unwanted and ill - thought out concept is formally discussed at a @entity7 meeting , representatives from @entity0 and other clubs would consider the competitive integrity and heritage of the @entity48 game and the impact on match going supporters , rather than another chance to earn even more money than they already do			1
it is clear from the media and social media networks that a large number of supporters are vehemently opposed to the idea			0
@entity190 , the @entity7 chief exectuive , and his acolytes seem to see money as an end in itself			2
the current television broadcasting deals mean that the @entity48 game at the top level is already awash with money			0
the fact that so much tv money goes directly to players and their agents is a matter for regret and remedial action by clubs , not shoulder - shrugging			0
the board of the @entity0 has little or no faith in the @entity208 , @entity209 or @entity210 in protecting the game 's best interests , but would hope that on this occasion , they will step in and ensure that playing domestic league games overseas is not allowed to happen			1
we will be working with national supporter organisations and fellow @entity7 supporters trusts to build coherent and effective opposition to this proposal			2
@entity220 to explore playing matches overseas			0
