@entity1 captain @entity0 is back in pre season training - but for the first time in 13 years he is undergoing the hard work ahead of a @entity6 campaign without @entity7 alongside him			1
with @entity1 's vice-captain departing at the end of his contract this summer , @entity0 has been left to start the season without the man he calls his ' best mate ' at the club			1
but the @entity15 have been busy in the transfer window already this summer and their captain is expecting a silverware challenge and reserved particular praise for their new midfielder and ' very good signing ' @entity23			1
' we have sat next to each other in the changing room since ... well , since he signed for the club really			0
i ’ve become really close to @entity7 and @entity40 and they were my two best mates at the club			2
' so i ’m really sad to see arguably the best player the club has ever had , in @entity45 , move on , for what he brought to the dressing room and as a mate			0
' you understand that you all get older , but you just hope that point does n’t come			0
' but @entity0 , who came on as a substitute for @entity1 in a pre season friendly at @entity53 on wednesday , is backing @entity55 's @entity7 replacement to fill the @entity1 legend 's boots			1
@entity23 starts training with the @entity15 on monday , after returning from his @entity60 holidays , and @entity0 believes the 27 - year - old will be a huge success at @entity63 , despite his past at @entity66 rivals @entity29			1
alone : @entity0 has been preparing for the new season at @entity68 without his best mate @entity7 old foes : @entity7 and @entity23 often came together in big games and @entity0 has praised his ' aggressive streak ' back to the day job : @entity0 has been training with his @entity1 teammates who did n't go to the @entity74 listening in : @entity0 is working alongside @entity55 again but it could be his last season at @entity1 ' he ’s a very good signing , ' @entity0 said			1
' he is great on the ball , a great box - to - box player , he scores an awful lot of goals as well and he has got an aggressive streak in him too – i certainly remember that from his @entity29 days			1
' i ’m sure he is going to fit in really well at @entity1 and do well in the years to come			2
' and @entity0 is bullish when it comes to talking about his side 's title chances in what could be his last year at @entity63			1
' i think we should be very competitive , ' he said			0
' we were close last year , but just unlucky at times			0
with the signings we have made and a couple of younger players who i think will surprise a few people this year			2
' i think this should be a very good year			0
we want to win trophies – that is always the aim from the outset for me			0
' i can see a lot more teams in the mix. first and foremost , though , we need to be solid , both home and away , because i think we dropped too many points against teams we should n’t have			0
