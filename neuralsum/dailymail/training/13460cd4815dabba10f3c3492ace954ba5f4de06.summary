a transplant surgeon at a leading hospital has saved his mother 's life by donating one of his own kidneys			1
it is thought to be the first time in the world that a transplant doctor has donated an organ			2
dr @entity11 , 32 , has performed more than 100 operations at @entity14 's @entity13 in the country 's busiest transplant unit , but never imagined that he would one day become a donor himself			1
he stepped forward when told his 64 - year - old mother @entity18 , who had been on dialysis for five years , might be dead within months unless she got a new kidney			1
family affair : transplant surgeon dr @entity11 ( right ) saved his mother @entity18 's life by donating one of his own kidneys for a procedure at @entity13 in @entity14 where he works the worried surgeon brought her to @entity14 from her home in @entity28 , @entity29 , to be cared for at his hospital			1
just hours after donating his own kidney , dr @entity11 found himself recovering in bed next to his mother and two other patients on whom he had recently operated			1
mrs @entity36 said : ' when i came round from my operation @entity11 was in the next bed and the first thing he said was : " mum now all your worries are over "			1
' other members of the family were either not a correct match for @entity36 or were not fit enough to donate			2
however , it was not all plain sailing			2
tests showed dr @entity11 was the wrong blood group , so the only way for him to donate directly was for his mother to go through a special blood - washing process to remove antibodies that would reject his kidney			1
he consulted colleagues about blood - washing , but they were reluctant to use the method because the risk of rejection is still too high			0
dr @entity11 and his mother were then advised to consider a new way of donating and receiving , called an organ - paired or pooled donation			1
this is where would - be donors who are not a correct match can find a correct match through an anonymous donor chain			0
dr @entity11 donated his kidney to an unknown person and another donor in the chain was a successful match for his mother			1
the chain of three transplants - involving three donors and three recipients from three transplant centres - took place simultaneously on july 31 with dr @entity11 's kidney going to a recipient in the @entity80 and mrs @entity36 receiving her kidney from a person in the south of @entity84			1
now mother and son are recovering well with dr @entity11 already back at work			1
mrs @entity36 is staying with him for several months while the hospital monitors her progress			2
dr @entity11 with his mother and father @entity91 , who is also a doctor			1
just hours after donating his own kidney , dr @entity11 found himself recovering in bed next to his mother and two other patients on whom he had recently operated he said : ' i did what anyone would do when they see a relative suffering but it was n't as straightforward as we had hoped			1
' a pooled donation was the only way of guaranteeing mum would get a transplant quickly			0
' although i was n't able to help mum directly , by agreeing to be part of a chain you all help each other			0
by volunteering in such a way we took three people off dialysis			0
' mrs @entity36 said : ' because @entity11 was a transplant surgeon he recognised how ill i was becoming			1
' he whisked me down to @entity14 to be seen by his colleagues			0
they stabilised me so that i was fit enough for a transplant			0
until i met the team at the @entity13 no one had mentioned a pooled donation			0
' i 'm not sure i 'd have got a transplant if it had n't been for @entity11 being in transplants			2
he knew exactly what was needed			0
' dr @entity11 works at @entity13 ( pictured ) , where his boss operated on him and his mother to perform the kidney transplant dr @entity11 's father @entity91 , 69 , who has been a gp in @entity28 for 36 years , said : ' we were reluctant for @entity11 to donate because he is young , but his sister and older members of the family were n't suitable for donation			1
' my wife really needed a transplant and @entity11 was aware that being on dialysis is not a bed of roses			2
it 's far from ideal and a lot of patients find leading a normal life quite difficult			2
' dr @entity143 said : ' people think that once you are on dialysis your life is not at risk			2
when i looked at the statistics i was quite shocked			0
' only 30 per cent of dialysis patients survive to five years and at ten years only ten per cent are alive			0
' being on dialysis is not good for the body because not all the toxins are removed and because people are not dialysed often enough			0
' patients only go on dialysis three times a week in hospital because there are not enough machines			0
ideally patients should dialyse every day or five or six times a week			0
' dr @entity11 's boss , professor @entity162 , performed both transplants			1
he said : ' what a magnificent gesture			0
@entity11 knows how vital it is to get more live donors			2
when his mum needed help he knew what he had to do			0
