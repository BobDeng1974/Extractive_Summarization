when you step foot into the control room at the @entity5 @entity4 station in @entity6 , @entity7 , the first thing that hits you is the smell , writes @entity10 for @entity11 hovering somewhere between urine and unwashed humanity , the air is thick and hot			1
the sound inside the circular , glass - enclosed control room is like that of a beehive , humming with the noise of hundreds of voices mixed with buzzers and footsteps			2
' this is where we do the processing , ' the border patrol agent tells us			2
each small space is sealed by a thick gray door , which is kept locked until an officer motions for the switchboard operator to open it			1
beside each door , dozens of tanned faces press against glass windows , watching the movement on the open floor around them			2
dozens more lie on the hard floor in the middle of the rooms , or on the wide benches attached to the walls			2
most of the visible faces belong to young children or teens ; the adults are usually clustered in the back or tending to toddlers and infants			1
the scene is devastating , and it ’s only one of several windows into the illegal immigration crisis that ’s sweeping across the @entity66 of the @entity5 - @entity68 border			2
since october 2013 , more than 181,000 illegal immigrants have already crossed this 250 - costal - mile area alone , and the @entity6 , @entity7 station has been the hardest hit			1
border patrol officers are doing the best they can , but they simply are n’t equipped to handle the masses that have flooded their facilities			0
location of the @entity4 station in @entity6 , @entity7			1
the station has been the hardest hit from a surge in illegal immigration natural border : @entity83 near @entity6 , @entity7 where many illegal aliens cross into the @entity5 awful : an illegal alien child drinks from a plastic bottle behind a security fence door inside a bus depot / housing facility in @entity6 , @entity7 the people – all @entity90 , as far as i can tell – are divided into several groups : family units are crammed into several rooms , teens 14 and under in the next , teens 15 and older in another , and single men and women in separate holding areas on the other side of the circle			1
people of all ages and genders – anywhere from young children to old men – are systematically brought out of their rooms to be ' processed , ' which involves taking down any identification , background , where they say they ’re headed , anything they can provide			1
it ’s usually not much			0
' this is where they start , ' the agent explains over the noise			0
' when they ’re picked up at the border , they come here			0
once we ’ve processed them , they ’re taken to the sally port			0
' that ’s where we head next			0
the sally port is a converted bus depot attached to the border patrol station			1
typically able to hold upwards of 4 buses at a time , the large , cement - floored space has been converted into a makeshift shelter to house the thousands of illegal immigrants that have been flooding the system since february			1
normally , the border patrol detains people anywhere from 12 hours to three days before turning them over to @entity141 , or the @entity142 , in the case of unaccompanied minors			1
but a backlog of people is now forcing them to house people for sometimes more than a week , agents said			1
sweltering heat : illegal immigrants bake all day with almost no shelter from the brutal summer weather the view from the @entity5 side of the @entity83 : looking over at @entity68 , where people are standing on the shore and where some illegals were taken to the @entity5 side by @entity159 and dropped off in the brush at the riverside ' we ’ve gotten pretty good at logistics , ' one agent told us			1
' but we ’re still only working with what we ’ve got			0
' the @entity6 station is authorized for 380 people , he explains			1
it ’s currently housing more than @entity170 wo n’t let us in the sally port – the ' folks in @entity173 ' require a scheduled visit for that , they tell us			0
but they say we can stand outside the locked gates at the bus entrance and look			1
i ’ve been outside for all of thirty seconds , but sweat is already starting to bead on my neck by the time i approach the gate to peer inside			0
if the scene inside the station ’s control room is bad , the view into the sally port is appalling			1
at first , there does n’t appear to be a floor			0
then i realize that ’s only because i can barely see it through the mass of bodies strewn across the massive space			0
there are people everywhere – lying down , standing , sitting , stepping over others in a strained attempt to move around			2
border patrol agents mill about with clipboards , talking to various people and administering basic medicine			2
off to one side , next to a row of blue porta potties , a group of four young girls are curled up together on the floor , resting on one another ’s limbs			0
all four are caked in mud to the knee , most likely from their trip across the border			0
they remind me of a litter of kittens i once saw , scrunched together in a little ball			0
from a distance : the former bus depot turned into a housing facility for illegal immigrants in @entity6 , @entity7			1
illegal aliens are behind the chained - fence doors			0
the floor is cement , there are temporary toilets , and large fans blow air across the room filthy : the smell of urine permeates the holding cells overflowing with illegal immigrants there ’s a simple strip of yellow crime scene tape that ropes off a small section of the space , the only barrier that separates the healthy from those who have been diagnosed with scabies			1
in the ' sick ward , ' a mother sits with her back against the locked gate , cradling a small child in her arms			2
she wipes the sweat from her own forehead before placing a half a dozen wet wipes on the little boy ’s face and chest , trying to cool him down			0
a second toddler sits beside her , sucking on a bottle filled with something that looks like orange juice			0
even standing under the force of five jumbo fans and a strong @entity7 breeze , the stench of unwashed bodies and well - used toilets hangs heavy , stagnating under the sweltering 100 - degree heat and making it hard to breathe			1
a border patrol bus pulls up to the gate			2
the doors open and a dozen more immigrants , mostly children , pile out , having come straight from the banks of the @entity66 where smugglers ferried them from the @entity68 bank to the @entity5			2
an agent ushers them through the door and into the processing room			0
this is n’t a dream , and it sure does n’t look like @entity285 .			0

the temporary holding cells were built in an old bus station in @entity6 , @entity7
adults and small children are held in pens with tile floors behind metal gates that provide little shelter from the sweltering heat of nearly 100 degrees @entity297
the smell of urine and body odor permeates the *encampment* holding about 1,100 people
*prisoners* range from toddlers to the elderly
