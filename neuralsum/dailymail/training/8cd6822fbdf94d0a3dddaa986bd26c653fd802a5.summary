by @entity0 his mother is know for being a fashion trendsetter and just hours after he touched down in @entity5 , it appears young @entity6 is following in her footsteps			1
the @entity8 was seen holding a kangaroo bag for his son as he waited to board a flight to @entity12			1
the @entity13 is one of the stockists of the bag and sold out of its remaining stock of the bag this morning			1
' we sold the last ones ( kangaroo bags ) this morning - we 've had to take them off the website but we 'll ordering more today , ' she said			2
ms @entity40 said the sudden rush of orders for the kangaroo bag , which was selling for $ 12.50 , was a result of the @entity21 seen carrying one			1
with the bag stocked at numerous outlets , ms @entity29 said there was no way of knowing how prince @entity51 go it , but she offered him an invitation to become the patron of the organisation on the back of his interest in conservation			2
sharing the love : the @entity13 is one of the stockists of the kangaroo rucksack and offered to give @entity6 a koala one an invitation has been offered to prince @entity21 to become the patron of the conservation foundation ' we would love it if @entity6 had a koala bag , ' ms @entity29 said			1
the ceo also offered to extend the invitation to young @entity6			1
' he could be the patron in waiting , ' ms @entity29 said of the 28 - year old conservation orgnaisation			0
the tiny future king was photographed by local media as he was carried onto a @entity12 @entity77 jet at @entity5 airport by his mother , the @entity79			2
the couple is about to embark on a three - week tour of @entity12 and @entity82 on behalf of the @entity83 - and insisted on taking their son with them			0
the family left @entity88 on at 9.25pm on saturday night on a commercial @entity90 flight , taking up the whole of the @entity93 cabin area			0
after a briefly touching down in @entity5 , the family swap plans bound for the @entity12 leg of their visit trendsetting : within hours of prince @entity21 being seen with the bag , demand soared and stockists including the @entity13 sold out of the rucksack and instead of hawking themselves from city to city , as is customary on overseas royal visits , @entity21 and @entity79 will base their young son in three different ‘ hubs ’ : @entity108 , @entity5 and @entity109			1
the arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see @entity6 almost every night – bar a stop - over in @entity112 , @entity12 , and another at @entity113 in @entity82			0
‘ it ’s a long way to go and [ would mean ] a long time away from their son , ’ the couple ’s private secretary , @entity114 , said earlier this month			0
‘ the tour has been designed with @entity6 ’s consideration and comfort in mind			0
‘ taking a nine month old on a royal tour is not a first , but it has not happened in this @entity125 ’s context for many , many years so there has been much to think about – as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise			0
’ the family touched down in @entity5 today , with the royal couple about to embark on a three - week tour of @entity12 and @entity82 on behalf of the @entity83 royal aides have warned that @entity6 ’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no - one knows how he will cope with the long journey and time difference			2
sources have told @entity140 that the little prince is also teething – as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability			0
it is hoped that @entity6 will undertake another official engagement while in @entity82 when he visits @entity146 where the @entity148 ( a native , long - eared rat - type marsupial ) enclosure was named after the little prince when he was born			2
but the baby will be left behind when the couple visit the legendary @entity113 , or @entity113 as it is known by the @entity153 population and enjoy a night ’s ‘ glamping ’ in a luxury resort			0
