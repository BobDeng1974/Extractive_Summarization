so there will be no title decided in january			2
@entity3 caution won the day over decisive risk taking			2
in short , the spectacle did not fit the billing			2
not even the return of @entity8 to @entity9 for the final 15 minutes of the game — the reaction was generally , though not exclusively , warm — could inject the necessary drama or create the fantastic finale			1
@entity14 and @entity15 both live to fight another day			1
the winter slog continues and the warm spring of title celebrations still seems some way off			2
in the end , @entity19 had more to lose , though it was his side which created the better chances and it was they who sought the winner in those final anxious minutes			1
@entity28 was , of course , content			0
‘ what we have , we hold , ’ might well be his mantra and a five - point lead going into february will suit just fine			1
the statistics will show they recorded just three shots , their lowest at home since 2003 - 04 and none in the second half			1
all will be forgiven if the title returns			0
there will be no rash dash for the line			0
when he can , he will entertain ; when he is challenged , he will revert to type			0
for @entity19 the only victory he could claim was moral			1
‘ i think both teams have a clear style of play , ’ he said			0
‘ everyone wants to play in the way they think is better			0
‘ you analyse the style of @entity14 and i analyse the style of my team			1
i ’m very proud of the way we played away against the leaders , where normally @entity14 wins			1
‘ we tried to win the game from the first minute , i ’m very proud about that			2
and i think we created the chances , especially in the second half , to deserve more than the three points			0
i ’m not happy about a point but i ’m happy about the performance			2
’ he would not be drawn into a philosophical discussion of @entity28 ’s football			0
‘ i ’m not saying we ’re more attacking , ’ he added			0
‘ i ’m saying both teams have a clear style			0
’ but that is not strictly true			0
@entity14 have scored 52 goals this season			1
when they wish to attack , they can ; saturday was not such an occasion			0
nevertheless it left @entity19 convinced he can still win the @entity140			1
‘ i said before the game that it was very important but not the final so we still have time to recover those five points			0
and if we continue the way we did today it will be easier			0
’ @entity43 is congratulated by his @entity14 team - mates after scoring his fifth goal of the season the @entity151 wheels away in celebration after finding a way past @entity155 goalkeeper @entity48 it was n’t that the football was bad , though the individual errors which characterised the first half will have embarrassed some stellar reputations , @entity76 and @entity56 among them			1
for much of the game the problem was both sides were good , just not in the way that excites you and grabs your senses			0
there was much for coaches to admire in midfield : solidity , tracking back , good team shape			2
there was a wild moment towards the end , when @entity81 swept a shot across goal , when you could believe that a dramatic conclusion was imminent			2
yet chances were few , the @entity81 moment notable for its rarity rather than its clear - cut nature			2
the opening exchanges set the tone : tetchy and tight			2
when the chances and goals came , it was individual errors , calamitous ones from seasoned pros , which were to blame			0
it started on 24 minutes , when @entity57 lost possession to @entity81 , a mistake which required @entity56 to parry a shot from @entity53			0
then it was @entity76 losing out to @entity43 , who crossed for @entity65 , whose shot forced a @entity48 save			1
on 32 minutes , @entity14 , busy appealing for a penalty , were caught out by a long ball which saw @entity59 slip and @entity53 break clear			1
the @entity199 should have scored but pulled the ball wide			2
and on 42 minutes @entity14 would prise @entity15 open with a quite delightful lofted ball from @entity57 which found @entity202 in space on the far left			1
the @entity204 delivered an exquisite first - time volleyed cross but for some reason @entity76 , perhaps fearful of turning it into his net , appeared half - hearted as he slid in to block			2
as such , he let the ball through to @entity43 , who had the simplest task in turning it in			1
@entity76 punched the ground in frustration , acknowledging his error			0
@entity14 centre back @entity58 celebrates with @entity43 following the former @entity218 striker 's first - half goal @entity53 's strike at goal was eventually turned in by @entity15 team - mate @entity50 from such positions @entity28 ’s team rarely surrender			1
yet three minutes later they had			0
this time it was @entity56 who had the aberration , flapping at a @entity228 cross			0
perhaps he was distracted by @entity81 , but the ball fell to @entity53 , who shot and saw @entity50 turn his strike into the net			1
thereafter , the game reverted to type			0
the highlight of the day was referee @entity92 giving @entity28 the kind of look primary school teachers reserve for their naughtiest pupils as the @entity14 manager protested another decision			1
@entity15 sat in @entity14 ’s half in the second half without threatening much			1
there was a @entity79 header into the ground which bounced upwards , requiring @entity56 to tip the ball over on 56 minutes and a shot on 68 minutes from the @entity247 but @entity56 collected that easily enough			0
the principal excitement came when @entity8 returned , trotting on to a mixed reception with 15 minutes to go			1
even he could not produce a denouement on such an auspicious occasion and perhaps because of that he was greeted warmly from all around the ground when the final whistle went			0
for @entity8 alone it was a day not to forget			1
@entity8 replaced @entity80 in the 77th minute to make a cameo appearance against his former side @entity8 ties the strings on his shorts as he waits on the sidelines before replacing @entity80 @entity14 star @entity202 is closely watched by @entity15 's @entity228 during the @entity140 encounter @entity262 forward @entity43 tumbles over during a collision near the @entity9 touchline @entity14 goalkeeper @entity56 is called into action during the top - of - the - table clash in west @entity268 former @entity14 star @entity8 was named on @entity15 's substitutes ' bench @entity8 is all smiles while warming up in front of @entity14 supporters at @entity9 @entity14 defensive midfielder @entity62 glides past @entity228 to maintain possession for his side @entity14 boss @entity28 gestures at @entity140 referee @entity92 @entity62 is challenged by @entity81 as he attempts to start an attack for his side @entity262 duo @entity279 and @entity280 watched the game from behind @entity14 's home dugout @entity14 captain @entity59 attempts to close down former team - mate @entity8 during the closing stages of the match @entity57 shakes hands with @entity8 after the final whistle at @entity9 @entity8 and @entity57 share a hug at the end of the match between the @entity140 's top two sides @entity262 skipper @entity59 also embraces @entity8 following the 1 - 1 draw @entity8 applauds the @entity9 faithful on his return to his former home stadium @entity8 received a fantastic reception from both @entity14 and @entity15 fans a @entity14 fan holds up a ' @entity8 is a legend ' banner despite the midfielder 's switch to rivals @entity15 whereas another @entity14 supporter held up a banner which read ' you are not a legend any more , you are a traitor '			1
