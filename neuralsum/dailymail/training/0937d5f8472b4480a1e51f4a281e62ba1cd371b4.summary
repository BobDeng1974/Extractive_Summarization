by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:13 est , 6 december 2013 a rare encryption device invented by the @entity4 towards the end of the war , which defeated @entity8 's code breakers , is set to be sold at auction			1
the @entity11 machine is only one of ten remaining in the world and was produced as a successor to the well - known @entity10 , which was famously thwarted by @entity16 intelligence officers at the top secret location known as ' @entity8 '			1
the initial order in 1944 was for 10,000 machines , but only around 100 were actually produced , initially because of material problems , and then the end of the war			1
@entity24 auction @entity22 and @entity25 are selling an exceptionally rare @entity11 encryption machine ( pictured ) which was designed as the successor to the famous @entity29 machine today there only two in working order , excluding the machine that will go under the hammer at @entity34 and @entity25 auctioneers in @entity36 , @entity37 , next wednesday			1
the rare device is expected to fetch between £ 15,000 and £ 20,000			1
the @entity11 model was made with a numeric keypad rather than a letter keypad , and was produced for the @entity42 to encrypt weather reports			1
it was recovered from the sea - bed and restored to a museum standard by an @entity37 - based expert in computer and machinery restoration , although it is not in working order			1
head auctioneer @entity51 said : ' this lot is extremely rare			2
today there are thought to be only around 10 in existence - and only 2 in working order			1
this model , the @entity11 , was made with a numeric keypad rather than a letter keypad , and these were produced for the @entity42 to encrypt weather reports ' @entity8 ' : @entity8 , pictured , was the hub of the @entity16 intelligence effort , where the @entity62 code was repeatedly broken ' it was brought up from a sunken u-boat a few years ago			1
' some machines were dumped into the sea after the war to stop the enemy getting their hands on them			2
' there is ticker tape underneath that the encryption code comes through			0
it is an amazing thing , there are masses of cogs			0
i have never seen one before			0
' mr @entity51 said he has already had some interest in the machine , as @entity83 memorabilia can be very collectable			1
' i have been doing this a long time and see a lot of the same old things coming through so it is great to see something that i have never seen before and something that most people have never seen before , ' he added			0
@entity91 : intelligence analysts , including these members of the @entity94 , worked tirelessly to break @entity96 codes in the @entity83 @entity97 is considered the father of modern computing and helped win @entity83 for the @entity100 the intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of @entity103 was to be decisive in the @entity100 effort to win the @entity83			0
@entity8 - known now as @entity8 - was the hub of @entity16 's code - backing effort , where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping - hand			0
as @entity113 himself made clear , the accurate information which flowed from @entity8 every day , at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day , saved lives and gave @entity16 a crucial edge in battle			1
@entity97 , the @entity119 - educated mathematical genius , and @entity121 engineer @entity120 , are the two most celebrated figures whose innovations greatly improved the @entity100 ability to decipher @entity96 messages			0
the enigma machine , which was on sale commercially in the 1920s , was modified by the @entity96 to make it more secure			1
they trusted completely that its codes were unbreakable , and used it for all manner of important communications			0
however , it was thwarted in part thanks to @entity97 's ' @entity138 , which was able to speed up the code - breaking process immeasurably			0
@entity97 based his invention on a @entity142 device , the ' @entity143 ' , which was handed over to @entity16 just weeks before @entity142 was invaded in 1939			2
it was not able to decipher @entity96 codes automatically , but once analysts had manually deciphered a few letters by picking out common words , such as the names of @entity96 generals or short words such as ' to ' and ' they ' , the device could rapidly test hundreds of other possibilities to put together a code			2
over 100 of the machines were built to aid the code - breaking effort , but they were all destroyed when the war ended			0
a replica was built in 2008 , and can be seen at @entity8 , which is now a museum			0
the quest to beat the @entity96 intelligence services also resulted in the construction of the world 's first proper computer - called @entity164			2
developed by @entity120 from a network of thousands of electronic valves , the device was able to crack the @entity170 , which the @entity172 high command used for messages deemed too sensitive for @entity10 transmission			2
the @entity164 , which was five times faster than the original , was finished less than a week before the @entity176 , and gave the @entity100 another crucial edge in the last phase of the war .			0

the @entity11 device , which was created in 1944 , is being sold at @entity34 and @entity25 auctioneers in @entity36 , @entity37 , next wednesday
the machine , which is not in working order , is only one of ten remaining in the world and is expected to fetch between £ 15,000 and £ 20,000
the device was made with a numeric keypad rather than a letter keypad , and was produced for the @entity42 to encrypt weather reports
