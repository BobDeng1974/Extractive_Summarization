the same time a decade ago that grade of beef cost $ 3.60 and in 1970 , the farthest back the @entity7 data goes , it was just 23 cents			2

authorities say other ranchers in the region have reported smaller losses , but note that typically one or two cow - calf pairs go missing almost every year			1
an entire herd disappearing is something else			0
' at this point we do n't have any suspects , ' said sgt. @entity57 of the @entity58 , which is investigating the missing @entity37			2
he said an aircraft was used in that search , and so far no other rancher has reported accidently rounding up the cattle , which happens sometimes			1
the sheriff 's office in nearby @entity66 , where the 102 cattle are missing , is also stumped			1
' it is a very cold trail , ' said capt. @entity69			0
' there 's no way of knowing when they went missing			2
that 's what makes it toughest			0
' but he also said that deputies are n't ready to confirm that the cattle have been stolen because they could have mingled with other herds in the area			2
but there have been no reports of that from other ranchers so far			2
authorities said taking that many cattle would likely involve tractor - trailers , and at least several people on horseback or all - terrain vehicles to round them up			2
' we 've never seen cattle prices this high before in the history of the cattle market , ' said @entity95 , a rancher in northern @entity1 near @entity96 and board member of the @entity98			1

' it 's supply driven , ' @entity117 said			0
' at some point we 'll expand the herd			0
' @entity117 said the @entity103 had a cattle population of 88 million in 2014 , and that @entity103 will eat about 54 pounds of beef per person this year			1
that compares to a cattle population of about 103 million in 1996 , when @entity103 at about 67 pounds of beef per person per year			1
@entity95 said ranchers are having to decide whether to cash in on high prices by selling more heifers that would normally be used to replenish or increase herd numbers			1
retaining those cattle is essentially betting that prices will stay high			2
@entity95 , 45 , said he 's sticking with his plan to hold onto about 15per cent of the heifers to maintain a herd of about 225 , but could understand if others chose differently			0
' it 'd be a great time to cash in on the market if you 're at an age where you 're close to retiring , ' he said			0
@entity12 , the state brand inspector , said that earlier this fall his office caught a man trying to sell ten dairy cattle he 'd stolen from a large dairy that did n't even realize they were gone			0

' he also said the cattle could simply be used to start another herd , as likely the cows were pregnant .			0
