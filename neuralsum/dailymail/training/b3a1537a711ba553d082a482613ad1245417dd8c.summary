written by seven @entity9 - based men who are both in and out of relationships , @entity11 , @entity7 argues that ' every man want to get married ' and poses a blunt question to its female readers : ' so why not with you ? ' ' no matter where a woman was in life , she should always be able to cater to her man ’s needs , ' one single author writes in an extract published by @entity23 , while a divorced co-author advises : ' when he gets his ego stroked , he will be more inclined to love you more			1
' where exactly did the romance go now that @entity53 barely pays attention to you anymore ? ' the book 's website reads			0
' it takes a lot to hold their attention , and men tend to lose interest in romantic partners when they stop being , well ... interesting			2
' mr @entity36 and mr @entity40 - who claim that when men say they do n't want to get married , they 're ' lying ' - spent three years surveying more than 300 male subjects online and in person to arrive at their conclusions			1

' he advises : ' prepare his meals , draw him a bath and massage his feet every now and then			0
' another author , this time married , claims that if a man does n't want to argue with you , it does not mean he is ' weak			1

' marriage manual : the book ( pictured ) hits bookstores february 10 , and promises answers to those ' burning questions you 've never been able to ask ' on a chapter which deals with ' why men lie ' , a single man suggests that telling the truth is ' risky ' and that lies are perpetuated ' to get our women to listen to us			1
' and then there 's the million - dollar question			0
why do men cheat ? one man , again single , joked that while a man can ' cheat on his woman ' and still ' sleep like a baby ' in the same bed , switching his barber will make him feel ' bad			1
' @entity114 described this foible as ' hilariously funny and true			0
' he also warned that for men , a new career can often trigger temptation to cheat			0
' we are exposed to a new supply of women who were n’t previously available , so we feel the need to explore these potential new mates that are now accessible , ' he states			2
