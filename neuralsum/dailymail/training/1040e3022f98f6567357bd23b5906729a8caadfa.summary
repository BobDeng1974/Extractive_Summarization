but they are concerned that the dithering , first highlighted in the @entity12 ’s stumbling response to the @entity40 scandal , is having a catastrophic impact on public trust in the @entity44 other developments yesterday : more to come ? : at least six other senior @entity12 executives may lose their jobs over the erroneous @entity6 broadcast a steady hand ? : acting director general of the @entity12 @entity50 , who was appointed following @entity16 's resignation			1
the former @entity53 executive has no editorial background yesterday @entity2 insisted that he would not bow to pressure to quit – but admitted his job was on the line unless he could turn the situation around quickly			1
‘ if i do n’t do that and if we do n’t restore the huge confidence and trust that people have in the @entity12 then i ’m sure people will tell me to take my cards and clear off , ’ he said			0
a senior @entity67 source was scathing about the chairman ’s performance			0
