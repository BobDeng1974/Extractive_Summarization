the author of @entity13 can be seen in the music video whizzing through space in his wheelchair , while the footage is interspersed with scenes of the @entity8 live shows			0

the video is interspersed with clips of @entity8 's recent live shows			2
it is a recreation of the song from the 1983 film @entity30 , when @entity49 originally took viewers on a journey through the cosmos			1
interestingly , much of the science in the song is right - or at least , fairly accurate , with a few exceptions for artistic reasons			0
for example , the lyrics state that @entity58 is ‘ revolving at nine hundred miles an hour			0
’ measured in nautical miles , this is true , but the current estimate near the equator is actually 1,040mph ( 1,670km/h )			0
it is also stated that ‘ the sun is the source of all our power , ’ which fails to consider that geothermal energy and the moon both also play a part in our planet ’s life			0
our galaxy is correctly said to have a hundred billion stars , though , while its size - a hundred thousand light - years across - is correctly stated			0
towards the end of the song , the speed of light is said to be 12 million miles per minute - which is pretty close to the actual figure of 11.16 million miles			0
whenever life gets you down , mrs. @entity82 and things seem hard or tough and people are stupid , obnoxious or daft and you feel that you 've had quite enough just remember that you 're standing on a planet that 's evolving and revolving at nine hundred miles an hour that 's orbiting at nineteen miles a second , so it 's reckoned a sun that is the source of all our power the sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see are moving at a million miles a day in an outer spiral arm , at forty thousand miles an hour of the galaxy we call the ' @entity11 ' our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars it 's a hundred thousand light years side to side it bulges in the middle , sixteen thousand light years thick but out by us , it 's just three thousand light years wide we 're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point we go ' round every two hundred million years and our galaxy is only one of millions of billions in this amazing and expanding universe the universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding in all of the directions it can whizz as fast as it can go , the speed of light , you know twelve million miles a minute and that 's the fastest speed there is so remember , when you 're feeling very small and insecure how amazingly unlikely is your birth and pray that there 's intelligent life somewhere up in space ' @entity124 there 's bugger all down here on @entity58 pictured here are @entity49 ( left ) , @entity2 ( centre ) and @entity33			2
