by @entity0 ready to score : @entity1 is in the running to be the new master of the queen 's music for almost 400 years , it is a role that has been filled by celebrated male composers , including sir @entity6 and most recently sir @entity7 , but now the @entity8 could have made a radical new departure			1
i hear that the new master of the queen ’s music has been chosen — and it is likely to be a woman			1
‘ the name will be announced next month , ’ says my man at the @entity14			1
‘ the word is that it will be the first mistress of @entity18			2
’ one of the most likely candidates to succeed sir @entity7 is @entity1 , who was awarded the @entity21 in 2007			1
the 60 - year - old @entity23 graduate trained with the late sir @entity24 , whose @entity25 was performed at princess @entity27 ’s funeral , and is best known for her operas , such as @entity29			1
it would not be the first time that the @entity8 has broken tradition by appointing a woman to an artistic role			2
in 2009 , @entity35 became the first female poet laureate			1
however , the @entity38 - born versifier has done little to endear herself to the monarch			1
the role involves writing poems for important royal occasions , but @entity35 , whose predecessors include @entity45 and sir @entity46 , has yet to compose an ode to mark the birth of @entity49			1
another possible candidate for mistress of @entity18 is @entity52 , 57 , whose work spans film and tv to pieces for the @entity57			2
establishment rivals for the post include @entity60 , a godson of @entity62 , who was elevated to the @entity63 as a crossbencher last year , and @entity65 , the composer of an anthem for prince @entity67 and @entity69 ’s wedding in 2011			1
traditionally , the @entity70 , who is expected to compose tunes to commemorate important royal events , holds the post for life			2
however , sir @entity7 , who has been treated for leukaemia , accepted it for just ten years			1
the 79 - year - old composer , completed that term in march , but agreed to continue until a successor was found			1
a @entity14 spokesman says an announcement about the post , for which the holder is paid an honorary stipend , will be made in ‘ due course ’			1
rushing , arms outstretched , prince @entity87 ’s ex , @entity86 , gave her old @entity90 headmaster @entity89 a big hug at a gala in aid of @entity94			2
dr @entity89 , who was on the gala committee , tells me : ‘ she called me “ headmaster ” and said she was pursuing her career as an actress , having been inspired by our head of drama , @entity107			2
‘ when @entity86 came to @entity90 last summer , she was desperate to find @entity105 to thank him in person			2
we spent about 20 minutes after the concert looking for him			2
’ having won over the @entity110 — the @entity111 and @entity69 revealed they are ‘ huge fans ’ of the show — @entity114 has set its sights on royals abroad			2
yesterday , @entity114 stars @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 posed with @entity121 ( right ) at the 54th @entity122			0
let ’s hope the prince , 56 , who has announced he and his wife , @entity125 , are expecting their first child , will look upon @entity114 more kindly than he did @entity128 — the @entity130 biopic about his mother @entity131 , which last month he described as ‘ a farce ’			1
@entity114 stars @entity119 , @entity118 and @entity120 ( pictured left tp right ) posed with @entity121 at the 54th @entity122 @entity138 - starred restaurant @entity136 , which counts @entity139 among its past chefs , is on the move			1
it is to be relocated once the proposed redevelopment of its site at @entity146 begins next year			1
opened in 1987 by @entity147 and the late chef @entity149 as a cafe for the employees of the architectural partnership founded by @entity147 ’s husband @entity153 , it also served as the unofficial canteen for @entity155			0
the @entity136 even hand - delivered a picnic to @entity157 on @entity159 ’s first day in office			1
@entity147 suggests the cafe ’s move might be permanent			0
she tells me : ‘ we are going to have to move temporarily then come back — or find another place			0
’ barely out of the womb , the newest member of the @entity168 clan is already gracing social media			0
elder sister of models @entity173 and @entity168 , @entity174 and her property developer husband @entity175 welcomed baby @entity176 on tuesday			0
after an 18 - hour labour , @entity176 was ready for his close - up , which @entity175 , @entity174 ’s second husband , immediately posted online			1
photo call : after an 18 - hour labour , @entity181 's ( right ) son @entity176 ( left ) was ready for his close - up @entity6 and a five - months pregnant @entity174 , 29 , wed earlier this year after a four - year courtship			1
@entity174 ’s first marriage in 2007 , to @entity186 ’s friend , nightclub impresario @entity185 , ended after a mere 17 months			0
last week , the couple were preparing for the baby ’s arrival by publicly gushing about their ‘ new set of wheels ’ from a well - known pram company			1
given the @entity196 ’ predilection for social media — even @entity168 ’s pet rabbit @entity199 has his own account — it can be only a matter of time before @entity176 is snapping ‘ selfies ’			0
bidders at charity auctions are a competitive bunch			0
but bidding against yourself , however worthy the cause , is surely above and beyond			0
not for @entity213 , wife of the former head of the @entity215 , @entity214 , at the @entity211 summer party in the @entity212 where he is constable			0
the lot in question was a behind - the - scenes tour of tv ’s @entity221 show conducted by @entity223 , the man @entity216 calls his ‘ eyes and ears ’			1
when the bidding reached £ 1,300 , @entity226 bid £ 1,400 , £ 1,500 and £ 1,600 in quick succession			0
it eventually went for £ 2,000 to a rival bidder			0
@entity231 would have been proud			0
as sir @entity233 consoles himself in the arms of a younger woman following the death of his partner @entity237 , his first wife , @entity232 , was caught napping on the @entity238 during rush hour on tuesday clutching a walking stick			2
the 69 - year - old @entity242 - born former model turned human rights activist , who filed for divorce from sir @entity233 on the grounds of his adultery with @entity248 , became a great - grandmother last month when her granddaughter @entity250 ( daughter of @entity233 and @entity232 ’s daughter @entity252 ) gave birth to a girl			1
and @entity232 is to become a granny again when @entity252 gives birth to her third child this month			2
no wonder she needs some shut - eye			2
sleeping beauty : @entity232 , was caught napping on the @entity238 during rush hour on tuesday clutching a walking stick ( left )			0
pictured right , the wide - awake @entity232 mad days at @entity262 , where @entity263 , 74 , was introduced to staff yesterday as a hip replacement for 76 - year - old ex-editor @entity266			1
‘ it ’s like a vipers ’ nest in here , ’ says an old timer			0
‘ chancellor seems completely past it , far more doddery than @entity153			0
’ @entity266 is giving a lunch today at @entity276 ’s @entity275 for his roll of honour — contributors who have resigned in protest at his departure			0
‘ @entity263 told me he would n’t take the job , but now he says he ’s “ very , very broke ” , ’ says @entity266			0
‘ so the bank manager has spoken			0
’ @entity284 famously once declared ‘ i do n’t have t * * s ’ , but yesterday the slender actress was happy to disprove her statement as she went bra-less underneath a red cardigan while meeting a friend in @entity289			0
the 29 - year - old , who wed @entity293 singer @entity292 in a low - key ceremony last year , has been vocal about her displeasure with producers enhancing her embonpoint in pictures			1
‘ they always pencil in my boobs , ’ @entity284 once remarked when asked about the posters for the 2004 flop @entity300 , in which her bust was digitally altered			0
however , she is less concerned about the size of her bosom than its direction , saying : ‘ if you ’re going to make me fantasy breasts , at least make perky breasts			0
