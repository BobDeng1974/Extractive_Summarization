by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 coach @entity2 has raised the prospect of @entity5 being called out of @entity7 exile for next year ’s @entity8 , just as the @entity10 back - rower was named @entity11			1
the 28 - year - old delivered another man - of - the - match display as his club retained the @entity15 on saturday			0
he also revived a debate about the @entity18 ’s edict against @entity3 selecting overseas - based players , with @entity21 columnist sir @entity20 among those to condemn the policy			1
while he wo n’t consider recalling the @entity41 8 for the tour of @entity29 , he may relent next year			0
asked about the @entity18 policy , @entity2 said : ‘ it is a good rule and one i support			1
that said , there are exceptional circumstances that allow us to select an overseas - based player			1
so who ’s to say that this time next year , if he ’s still playing as well , that the door might not be open ? impressive : @entity2 was in the crowd as @entity5 starred for @entity10 on saturday at @entity54 ‘ it would have to be close to a @entity8			1
i would n’t do it for the @entity29 tour , autumn internationals or the @entity59 , not when i ’ve got other players who can be developed			0
’ for the next year , the door will almost certainly remain shut , as @entity2 added : ‘ it ’s got to be associated with injuries ( for now )			2
it ’s a rule supported by clubs , the country , the @entity18 and the @entity65 ( @entity66 )			2
i spoke with @entity67 about going to @entity68 and he is aware of the position			0
that ’s the risk you take			0
’ while @entity73 players , in particular , are leaving domestic clubs in numbers , there has not been a huge exodus of @entity78 stars across the @entity79			0
outcast : @entity5 last played for @entity3 in 2010 , but has n't been eligible since his move to @entity82 @entity2 suggested that validates the @entity18 ’s approach			1
‘ you want players to play in our club programme because it helps our club game , it helps the development of players , ’ he said			0
‘ if @entity5 or @entity67 were to go ( with @entity3 ) , what would happen next ? if @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , @entity98 ( @entity99 ) , @entity96 ( @entity97 ) — the list goes on — chose to go , it would have a knock - on effect but i ’m not getting any indication of that			2
the younger players , all they ’re talking about is wanting to play for @entity3 and play for their clubs			2

@entity3 coach says @entity3 door could open again for the @entity10 *flanker*
@entity2 recently met with @entity5 , the @entity11
@entity5 won the last of his five @entity3 caps in 2010 while he was playing for @entity118
@entity21 columnist sir @entity20 is among those who condemn the @entity18 *'s* policy not to select overseas - based players
@entity2 says he can pick players not based in @entity3 in ' exceptional circumstances ' , and come the @entity126 could fit that bill
