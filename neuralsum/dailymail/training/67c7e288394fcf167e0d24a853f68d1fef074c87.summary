president @entity0 is being accused of sexism for publicly remarking on @entity4 attorney general @entity3 's good looks at a fundraiser in @entity6 on thursday , though he was forced to call her and apologize later that night after his remarks sparked a firestorm and he was accused of being sexist			1
the president said of the 48 - year - old : ' she ’s brilliant and she ’s dedicated , she ’s tough ... she also happens to be , by far , the best looking attorney general , ' @entity0 said , adding , ' it 's true ! c'mon ! ' according to a pool reporter who attended the event , @entity0 was doting on @entity15 , ' noting a couple of times that she is , objectively , easy on the eyes			1
' president @entity0 apologized for the distraction that his comments caused and his press secretary released a statement saying that the president ' regretted ' the move			1
commentators both liberal and conservative immediately took to @entity28 to blast his remarks as ' unsettling , ' ' disgraceful ' and ' disrespectful			2
added @entity49 , writer for the @entity50 and @entity51 , ' on what planet in [ @entity0 's ] mind did he think that sounded like the right thing to say ? ' @entity0 's supporters argue that the president and @entity15 , who is not married , are good friends and that it should n't be considered a crime to compliment a women on her obvious good looks			2
' the fact that this has in some way become a story about his overall respect of women ( or lack thereof ) is a slap in the face to the first lady , the first daughters , and every other woman who appreciates a compliment that extends far beyond appearance from the president or any other man , ' @entity63 , a @entity64 political consultant , told @entity80			0
on friday , press secretary @entity81 made the first public reaction by the @entity83 , saying : ' he apologized for the remark			1
he certainly regretted the distraction			0
he believes that she is a superb ag. ' the president ' did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general 's professional accomplishments and her capabilities			1
' he fully recognizes the challenges women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance , ' mr @entity81 said			0
@entity96 has not commented on the controversy , but she did have a slip - up of her own on thursday in a tv interview where she accidentally called herself a ' single mother			0
' during an interview with @entity104 , @entity107 @entity106 affiliant @entity105 , the first lady was discussing healthy foods and how the demands of raising a family can leave little time for nutritious cooking			0
' believe me , as a busy single mother , @entity0 said , before quickly correcting herself , ' or i should n't say single - as a busy mother			0
' explaining her slip - up , she added , ' sometimes , you know when you 've got the husband who 's president it can feel a little single			0
' @entity123 ? @entity0 remarked on @entity15 ' looks on the same day that @entity96 slipped up in an interview and called herself a ' single mother ' rising star : many speculate that ms @entity3 , the current attorney general for @entity4 , could go on to run for governor of the state or even serve on the @entity132 woman of firsts : she is the first female , @entity42 and @entity136 attorney general in the state , as well as the first @entity139 @entity42 attorney general in the country ms @entity3 is a @entity64 favorite and a trailblazer in her home state			1
her mixed race descent - having been born of an @entity40 mother who emigrated to the @entity146 from @entity147 and a @entity43 @entity42 father - made her the first female , @entity42 and @entity136 attorney general in the state			1
on top of that , she is the first @entity139 @entity42 attorney general in the country			1
her career shows no sign of stopping , as she is regularly mentioned when pundits speculate about possible @entity132 nominees should a new judge be appointed during president @entity0 's second term			2
another possible track for her is the gubernatorial one , as attorney general is a common springboard position for those hoping to climb the local ladder			2
@entity166 is known about her current romantic situation , except that she was in a serious relationship with the former mayor of @entity6 @entity170			0
the two were a serious item and dated when he was the speaker of the @entity173 , but they reportedly broke up in 1998			0
there are no pictures of president @entity0 and ms @entity3 together at thursday 's event , which was a fundraiser for the @entity178 held at the home of @entity180 , the heir to the @entity182 fortune .			2
