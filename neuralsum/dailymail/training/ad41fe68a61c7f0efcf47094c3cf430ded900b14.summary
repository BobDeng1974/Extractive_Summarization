by @entity0 published : 04:05 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:53 est , 6 february 2014 several bears lie on top of each other as still as teddy bears as they gaze out past rusty iron bars			2
the ground below their metal cages is littered with feces , @entity13 doughnuts , dog food and fruit			0
but these bears are n't dying			2
though their bile has been used as medicine in @entity30 for thousands of years , cheaper foreign sources , growing skepticism over bear bile 's medicinal value and worries about international condemnation have led to a huge drop in @entity39 demand			1
@entity40 , the owner of this farm in @entity42 , about 120 kilometers ( about 75 miles ) south of @entity43 , said he has n't had a bear bile customer in five years			2
that , however , does n't ensure the animals a peaceful future			0
cruel : bears look out from a cage at a bear farm in @entity42 , south of @entity43 , @entity39 the government is offering farmers money and incentives to sterilise or slaughter their bears , but the farmers are demanding much more			1
@entity40 , secretary general of a bear farmers ' association , said farmers are considering suing or even more drastic measures - such as harming their bears - if they ca n't reach a deal			2
he said farmers will raise the issue of greater government compensation during a meeting with government officials and civilian experts thursday			0
to highlight their grievances , farmers in november brought caged bears to downtown @entity43 and near a government complex in the city of @entity71			0
@entity40 said farmers are now considering hauling bears , 20 per cage , to the @entity71 government complex in the hope that the fighting , cramped animals will bring them attention			0
' people talk about animal welfare ... but bear farmers are n't getting any welfare , ' said @entity83 , who runs a bear farm near @entity43			0
helpless : a bear stretches its paw through a cage at a bear farm in @entity42 , south of @entity43 , @entity39 ' we feel like we are dying earlier ( than our bears )			1
' @entity39 is one of the few countries that allow the farming of bears to extract bile for traditional medicine			1
about 50 farms are raising about 1,000 bears , mostly @entity99 black bears , also known as moon bears			1
they are the descendants of bears imported from @entity103 and other @entity105 countries when bear farming began here in the early 1980s			1
@entity40 said @entity39 were once willing to pay between 20million to 30million won ( $ 18,450 - $ 27,680 ) to have a bear slaughtered for its bile			1
but farmers ran into trouble about a decade ago , when bear bile from @entity113 and @entity114 became more readily available			2
now the farmers have an even bigger problem : bear bile just is n't popular			1
@entity116 , the owner of bears looks at his animals inside a cage , at his bear farm in @entity42 , south of @entity43 , @entity39 @entity39 imported only 2.8 kilograms ( 6.2 pounds ) of dried forms of bear gall bladders between 2008 and 2012 , according to the @entity124			1
in 2011 , about 94 percent of @entity39 surveyed by the private @entity125 said they had never bought bear bile and had no intention of doing so			1
the telephone survey of 1,000 people had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points			0
the bear farmers ' association says most of its members have n't sold any bile in five or six years			2
meanwhile , huge debts from feeding and maintaining the bears are mounting			0
@entity40 , who has about 270 bears at his farm , said their upkeep costs him about 300 million won ( $ 276,750 ) annually			0
the @entity145 said it plans to spend about 6.2 billion won ( $ 5.7 million ) by 2016 on an anti-breeding campaign , but that no final compensation plan for farmers has been settled			0
officials would n't elaborate but called the campaign a meaningful first step toward ending the industry			0
a bear stretches its snout through a cage at a bear farm in @entity42 , south of @entity43 , @entity39 @entity40 , however , said ministry officials recently proposed that farmers receive about 1.3million won ( $ 1,200 ) from the government for the sterilisation of one bear ; 400,000 won ( $ 370 ) annually for feed cost ; and 1.5 million won ( $ 1,390 ) for the slaughter of bears older than 10			1
farmers say that is n't enough , and that the government should take more responsibility for their troubled businesses because officials earlier encouraged them to raise bears			0
the government started allowing bear imports in 1981 , but @entity145 officials say there are no official documents showing it encouraged bear farming			1
bear bile has been used in many @entity105 countries to treat a range of illnesses , including abscesses , hemorrhoids , epilepsy and cysts			2
until recently , many @entity39 believed bear bile could cure all diseases and bolster vitality and stamina			1
' it 's not a panacea , ' said @entity191 , a @entity39 traditional medicine professor at @entity43 's @entity192			1
he said there are also alternative medical ingredients that can replace bear bile , so most traditional doctors in @entity39 do n't suggest expensive bear parts			1
in @entity113 , where bear bile harvesting is legal , more than 10,000 bears are kept in farms , their cages sometimes so small that they are unable to turn around or stand on all fours , according to @entity204 , a @entity205 - based animal welfare group			1
a bear looks out from a cage at a bear farm in @entity42 , south of @entity43 , @entity39 the organisation said that about 2,400 bears are illegally raised in farms in @entity114 , which outlawed the practice in 2005			1
as for the @entity39 bears , their lives may improve little beyond their current state no matter how much government money farmers get			2
@entity39 is trying to restore a sub-species of the moon bear , but farm bears do n't count because they are likely mixed breeds			1
so they probably will stay in places like the @entity222 farm , the largest of its kind in @entity39 , as long as they live			2
the cages , set up just above the ground , are in varying sizes			0
ten 220lb bears share a 40 - square - meter ( 430 - square - foot ) enclosure , and four 290lb bears share 170 square feet			0
some bears are missing a paw , or an ear			0
@entity40 , the owner , said they were attacked by bigger bears when they were cubs			0
some bears are caged by themselves because they are too violent			0
some bears spend their days repeatedly moving back and forth			0
it 's a motion researchers say is triggered from the stress of being locked up in a small place .			0

@entity39 is one of the few countries that allow the farming of bears
the bile extract is used for traditional medicine
bear farming began in the early 1980s and there are about 50 farms
however , bile is not popular *anymore* and the industry is dying
