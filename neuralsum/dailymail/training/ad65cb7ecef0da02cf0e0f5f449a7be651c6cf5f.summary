by @entity1 reporter the parents of two schoolboys who killed themselves 15 months apart have criticised the school they attended for their muted response over the suicides			1
the two boys hanged themselves after their personalities changed , they began dressing in black and listening to music with ' dark ' , depressing lyrics , it has been claimed			1
@entity12 , 15 , hanged himself in his home , in @entity14 , and just over a year later @entity15 , 16 , was found dead in similar circumstances			1
@entity12 ( left ) , 15 , hanged himself in his home , in @entity14 , and just over a year later @entity15 ( right ) , 16 , was found dead in similar circumstances two months after that a 14 - year - old attempted to hang himself but failed			1
all three were students at @entity20 , in @entity21 , near @entity14			2
the parents of a fourth youngster , also thought to be a member of the ' friendship group ' , were alerted when he was overheard by friends talking about suicide			1
police and medical experts in the town have investigated but say there is no criminal link between the three incidents and now the school has regular visits from a mental health counsellor available to speak to youngsters			2
@entity12 was found dead at his home in november 2011 and @entity14 coroner @entity38 recorded a suicide verdict last year			1
last week the same coroner recorded the same verdict at an inquest into @entity15 ’s death in february last year			1
@entity15 ’s mother @entity44 contacted @entity12 ’s mother @entity46 on @entity47 when the parallels between the two deaths - less than a mile apart - became apparent			1
outgoing : @entity15 pictured when he was on holiday on the @entity52 island of @entity53 in 2009 the parents of both boys want to remove the stigma around discussing the issue of @entity58 have also criticised @entity20 over their muted response			1
@entity15 's father @entity60 , 44 , said : ' you might think that because you ’ve protected your children and kept them away from what you consider to be the dangers , they wo n't be affected by things like this			1
' it ’s difficult to give advice , but if anything i would say act sooner and talk about the topic			0
' mrs @entity46 said : ' you send yourself crazy wondering about what ’s normal because suicide is a taboo subject			2
it ’s not something people speak about			0
' i had nothing from the school other than a letter , just a couple of lines saying sorry to hear what had happened			0
@entity12 was found dead at his home in november 2011 and @entity14 coroner @entity38 recorded a suicide verdict last year in a hearing at a @entity14 court ( pictured ) ' later , i emailed asking what measures had been put in place with regards to suicide and got no reply			1
they told students not to talk about it and it felt like they covered it up instead of using it to raise awareness			0
' changes to both @entity15 and @entity12 saw them lose weight , wear black clothing and start listening to ‘ dark ’ music			1
but the parents say that blaming bands with depressing lyrics in their songs is too easy and glosses over the real issues			1
mrs @entity46 said : ' focusing on the music covers up the underlying factors			2
it ’s used like a scapegoat rather than looking at why they are listening to that sort of music			2
' @entity15 on a 2011 outing mr @entity15 added : ' i see music as effect rather than the cause			1
if you feel down you might put on a " down " song			0
if that ’s all you ’re listening to then i think it can have detrimental effect over time			0
' it feels wrong to be drawing the conclusions that we are			0
you think these things only happen in cults or to those involved in the darkest recesses of society			0
' all of us have learned the hardest way possible that these things , and these people , are much closer to home than we ever realised			2
' dr @entity140 , director of @entity141 said : ' we have responded in relation to the incidents in @entity21			0
' it has heightened our awareness of teen suicides and the importance of mental health and well being			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity150 said : ' an investigation was launched into the deaths of two young people from @entity154 and @entity21 and the apparent attempted suicide of another person , all from the same friendship group			2
' the investigation considered whether there was any link between the three incidents but concluded there was no criminal link			0
' we have been working closely with its partners to provide support to the families and friends of those involved			2
' the school has increased the number of days a week when a mental health charity worker is available to pupils from two to five			0
head teacher @entity172 has earlier said : ' we express our sincere condolences to the families of the young people affected , during what has been a tragic and very difficult time			0
' @entity179 chief executive @entity178 added : ' we are all working together to develop an approach which supports the whole community to identify young people at risk of suicide and self harm			2
' @entity15 , pictured in the @entity186 in 2002 last week an inquest into @entity15 ’s death heard that the schoolboy was happy , gifted at art and enjoyed outdoor activities			1
he had a good relationship with his parents and younger brother until about eight months before his death			1
@entity196 and friends say he became introverted , lost weight and wore dark clothing			2
his mother mrs @entity15 , who separated from @entity15 ’s dad seven years ago , said she felt like they were being pushed away by @entity15			1
she told the inquest : ' i tried to talk to @entity15 but got very little back			1
it upset me that he would n’t talk about anything			0
he was very secretive and pushed boundaries by not being home on time			2
' she found him hanged when she returned to the house in @entity154 , @entity14			1
his parents had become concerned about his progress in the sixth from at school and the amount of time he spent with his girlfriend , now aged 18			2
mr @entity15 said : ' @entity15 ’s clothing had become darker			1
from that time onwards he was always in black it came after the change in friendship group			0
' i had known that he ’d been finding it difficult , pretty much from the start			0
we met with one of the teachers and felt their was some hope and he might be able to recover the situation			0
' several of his friends spoke to police during an investigation into the death and one told them she thought @entity15 was ‘ trapped ’			1
det con @entity239 told the inquest in @entity14 : ' she felt he showed glimpses of paranoia and was emotionally unstable			0
' weeks before his death @entity15 sent a text to another friend saying : ' screw it			1
i ’m on the edge of killing myself every day			0
' @entity15 ’s girlfriend , who asked not to be named , denied seeing much change in him after they met in the summer of 2012			1
she said : ' sometimes he got a bit paranoid that i was going to break up with him			0
sometimes he got that into his head			0
' he always said he never felt comfortable at home			2
the main unhappiness and stress he displayed was about school and the sheer workload of starting a-levels			0
' asked about his music taste she said : ' i do n’t see it as dark music , i just see it as music			1

he was n’t always very responsive in class			0

he was trapped with no one to turn to for objective advice			0
' he was putting himself under pressure with his girlfriend who was perhaps not best equipped to recognise his problems and still less deal with them			0
' an inquest a year ago heard that @entity287 student @entity12 was a ‘ happy bubbly joker ’			1
