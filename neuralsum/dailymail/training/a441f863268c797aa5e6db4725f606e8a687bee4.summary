by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 12:01 est , 15 september 2013 it is hard to imagine a more impressive setting for an apartment			1
@entity4 is a very grand @entity5 mansion surrounded by 40 emerald - green acres in a quiet corner of rural @entity8			1
driving along country lanes from the nearby village of @entity12 , you could believe you have travelled back in time to a previous century			2
@entity13 is one of the many country mansions that have been divided into apartments , but what ’s unusual for a building of this size is that there are just ten apartments			1
two of them – by far the largest and most spectacular – are owned by designer @entity22 , son of @entity24 founder sir @entity23			1
within his central apartment , which covers the ground and first floor , where the grand public rooms used to be , is the centrepiece of the house , a curved staircase rising 60ft to a dramatic decorated rotunda with circular skylight			1
house on the hill : the imposing exterior of 18th century @entity4 which contains ten apartments the castle was built in 1776 by @entity40 , whose family had owned the previous @entity4 , now a romantic ruin a mile away , since 1547			1
the family lived in the ‘ new ’ castle until the 16th lord @entity40 died without an heir during the @entity46			2
after a period of neglect , the mansion became a girls ’ school but suffered inglorious extensions in the 1960s , and a tennis court was built on the @entity55			1
it was eventually sold to a developer in the 1990s , who got rid of the extensions , did a great deal of restoration work and turned the mansion into elegant apartments with the help of architect @entity64			1
fans of the film @entity66 will have seen some of @entity13 ’s interior , as it was used during filming as the dance school			2
dream kitchen : the brightly decorated hub in @entity73 and @entity75 's apartment at @entity4 going on sale for just under £ 700,000 flooded with light : all the rooms in @entity75 and @entity80 's flat have mesmerising views of the idyllic parkland and @entity8 hills and farmland beyond the apartments are all completely different shapes and sizes , but their generous square footage means that little of the grandeur of the original building is lost			1
artist @entity91 and photographer @entity92 bought one of the three top - floor apartments 14 years ago			2
they were living in @entity95 but wanted somewhere peaceful they could escape to at weekends			0
they knew someone who lived nearby who told them there was an apartment for sale in the castle			1
‘ we got very excited as soon as we saw it , ’ says @entity80			0
‘ it ’s the most amazing building			0
as soon as you walk into the hallway downstairs , you get this fantastic feeling of space – you know that you ’re in a mansion			1
’ space , style and light are what strike you most about @entity80 and @entity75 ’s three - bedroom , two - bathroom apartment			2
@entity118 : designer @entity22 has two flats in the mansion the lofty ceilings , beautiful sash windows with deep recesses revealing the thickness of the walls , wide doorways , timber flooring and white walls create an elegant backdrop for @entity80 ’s paintings and @entity75 ’s photographs			1
‘ the building is @entity133 i listed so you ca n’t do anything structural , but you can decorate as you like , ’ says @entity80			1
‘ we prefer white walls and ceilings so nothing gets in the way of the architecture			0
’ they have added colour and texture with bright cushions , 1950s ceramic lamps and quirky objects they have collected from all over the world			0
the sitting room is a generous 28ft by 25ft , big enough for five sofas and flooded with light from four windows , two on opposite sides of the room			0
the dining room next door is also 28ft long , though narrower , but there is more than enough space for the huge rustic wooden table that could seat ten guests			2
all the rooms have the most mesmerising views of the idyllic parkland and @entity8 hills and farmland beyond			0
from the master bedroom you can take in the whole bucolic scene without even getting out of bed , as you can from the roll - top bath in the spacious en suite			0
‘ we have loved it here			0
it ’s a great place for entertaining , and the history is a big part of it for us , ’ says @entity75			0
they have bumped into some of the women who were at school here , and have even met a woman who used to ride her pony inside the house when it was empty			0
‘ it ’s also ideal because we can just come and enjoy the countryside without having to worry about the garden or maintenance , ’ adds @entity75			0
‘ with 40 acres , there ’s no need for a garden			0
’ @entity80 , 61 , and @entity75 , 63 , have decided to sell both their @entity95 house and the castle apartment to buy a bigger place in the area , where @entity80 can have a studio			2
the apartment is on the market for £ 695,000 with a 170 - year lease			1
‘ it ’s very quiet here because the walls are so thick that you ’re not aware of anyone else in the building , ’ says @entity75			0
‘ people like their privacy but everyone here is very friendly			0
’ and what about their famous neighbour @entity22 ? ‘ he ’s friendly and he has a good sense of humour , ’ says @entity80			1
‘ and of course he has impeccable taste			0
