the @entity1 royal family are building a 600 - mile barrier to fortify the northern frontier of their kingdom			2
the fence and ditch , punctuated with radar surveillance towers , command centres and guard posts , aims to protect the @entity1 ' oil - rich territory from invasion by the @entity14 insurgency			1
last week a suicide bombing and gun attack which killed two @entity1 border guards and their commanding officer was styled by one analyst as the @entity14 's first attack on the kingdom			1
@entity1 's @entity38 inaugurated the first phase of the border security project in september , soon after @entity14 's @entity42 insurgency swept across @entity35			1
the multi-layered barrier , which will eventually stretch across the @entity1 - @entity35 border from @entity45 to @entity46 , includes 78 monitoring towers , eight command centres , 10 mobile surveillance vehicles , 32 rapid - response centres , and three rapid intervention squads , reports @entity52			2
citing a promotional video , the defence industry magazine reported the six - mile - deep barrier consists of a ditch , two fences and a patrol road connecting the watchtowers and guard rooms			0
the video included footage of thermal imagers and battlefield radar systems that can detect individuals at up to 12 miles away and vehicles at up to 24 miles away			1
@entity14 sees @entity1 's links to the @entity68 as a betrayal of @entity70 and has called for ' lone - wolf ' attacks against @entity1 security forces , the @entity75 minority and foreigners			2
@entity1 forces have joined @entity79 - led air strikes against @entity14 positions in @entity81 and mobilised conservative @entity42 clergy to describe the ideology of the @entity85 offshoot as deviant			0
expansion of the @entity14 could turn into an existential struggle for the @entity1 regime , which many hardline islamists see as decadent and corrupt			0
a key goal of jihadists is the ultimate capture of @entity1 , the birthplace of @entity70 and home to the @entity95 of @entity96 and @entity97			1
tragic : a picture released by the @entity99 shows a cleric and mourners praying in the holy mosque in @entity96 during the funeral of three @entity1 guards killed in an attack on the kingdom 's border relations between @entity35 and @entity1 have already been deeply strained			1
@entity109 has accused former @entity35 prime minister @entity110 of creating the conditions for the jihadist insurgency in his country by marginalising its @entity42 @entity116 minority			0
@entity110 in turn has accused the oil - rich kingdom of supporting ' terrorism ' in @entity75 - majority @entity35			0
three of the four killed in last week 's raid were @entity1 nationals who local media described as members of the ' deviant group ' , a phrase authorities use to describe @entity85			0
three more @entity1 nationals and four @entity81 have since been arrested in @entity1 in connection with the attack .			0

the capture of the @entity95 at @entity97 and @entity96 is a key is objective
security fence includes thermal imaging systems and battlefield radar
attack on border post last week said to be first is attack on kingdom
