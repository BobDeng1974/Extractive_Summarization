he was found nearby in february and reunited with owner @entity10
but in a second *bid* for *freedom* this week the tom cat got itchy feet
he disappeared for 24 hours before ms @entity10 spotted him in her garden
desperate that he not escape again she made a grab for him
he lashed out sinking his sharp teeth into her hand 10 times
ms @entity10 said despite her injuries having @entity6 home is ' all that matters '
