a major player in online travel has finally ' fallen into line ' by removing excess credit card charges two years after the @entity4 ruled that surcharges should be limited to ‘ reasonable costs ’			1
online booking agent @entity7 confirmed they are dumping their $ 5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $ 20 million dollars back into the pockets of @entity12 consumers			1
they are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $ 16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $ 9.95 per person			1
@entity7 have dumped excess booking fees which could save @entity12 $ 20 million a year while @entity7 has been praised for the move , consumers who expected to see a drop in prices may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent , reported @entity28			1
@entity29 thinks there needs to be a regulatory body to stop companies from charging exorbitant prices for using a credit card or booking online @entity29 from @entity36 told @entity37 that an increase in commission prices could be an effort to further ' fleece ' customers in a bid to offset losses from dropping the controversial credit card fees			1
@entity7 said the change is not a bid to recoup costs lost by the surcharge but a reflection on their recent acquisition by competing company @entity53			2
mr @entity29 said the rise in commission will increase up front costs of travel however the removal of the credit card surcharging is win for consumers and a clear warning to other companies who continue to ‘ flout ’ the ban on excessive charges			1
‘ it ’s great to see consumers unite to drive change because it sends clear signal to businesses that we are n't happy			0
’ he said excessive credit card charges are costing @entity12 ’s over a billion dollars a year , with some of the ‘ worst offenders ’ being @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			1
‘ people are sick and tired of being ripped off by the top end of town , ' he said			0
@entity82 , the business man responsible for an anti surcharge petition that 's been signed by over 100,000 people , welcomes the change and agrees this move puts more pressure on other major players to respond to ' consumer sentiment ' by removing ' outrageous fees '			1
' no where else in the world does this exist , ' he said			0
mr @entity82 started an online petition to stop airlines and travel companies from taking advantage of consumers by charging ' ridiculous ' amounts for using credit cards mr @entity82 said prices are ' misleading ' and not an accurate reflection of what businesses are actually paying to use credit cards			0
' they are just plucking these figures from their backsides to rip of consumers , ' he told @entity37			0
@entity36 recently released a report that shows merchants are only paying around 0.8 per cent for @entity111 and @entity112 and 2 per cent for prestige cards like @entity114 and @entity115			0
according to the latest research data made available by @entity112 , @entity12 consumers are being surcharged about $ 1.6 billion each year			0
@entity75 , @entity78 , @entity76 and @entity77 continue to flout the ban on excessive credit card surcharges mr @entity82 believes these numbers prove that @entity12 's are facing excessive surcharges and that companies ' can not be trusted to self regulate '			2
choice have also called for a regulator who have explicit legal power to limit credit card surcharges			2
according to mr @entity29 excessive surcharging needs to be regulated by a body with the power to demand evidence of fair pricing and subsequently enforce significant penalties for non compliance			2
' for too long hotels and airlines have been thumbing their nose at the government and there needs to be a regulatory body who have more power to enforce the ban , ' mr @entity29 said .			0

@entity7 have removed a controversial $ 5.50 credit card surcharge
this comes two years after the @entity4 banned excessive surcharging
*watchdog* choice said this is great news for consumers

while surcharging has been removed , @entity7 increased commission rates
some *critics* say this is to offset the loss of the surcharge
