a man who converted from @entity1 to @entity2 is facing the death penalty in @entity4 for refusing to return to his former religion			1
pastor @entity6 , 34 , of the @entity7 , faces hanging after refusing a court order to renounce his @entity10 faith			1
if the execution goes ahead it would be the first @entity10 to be officially executed in @entity4 for religious reasons in 20 years			2
the pastor had defied a request by the @entity17 provincial court , in the @entity4 city of @entity19 , to repent ahead of today 's hearing			2
facing execution @entity6 with his wife and two children in an undated photograph circulated by religious rights organisations despite assurances that @entity6 's case will be sent back to @entity4 's @entity29 , his supporters fear the provincial court will use a law , temporarily ratified by parliament , to execute him this week			1
the married father - of - two was detained in his home city of @entity19 in october 2009 , while attempting to register his church			1
supporters of the pastor say he was arrested after questioning the @entity38 monopoly on the religious instruction of children in @entity4			1
foreign secretary @entity41 has urged @entity4 to spare @entity6 's life by overturning his sentence			1
mr @entity41 said : ' i deplore reports that pastor @entity6 , an @entity46 leader , could be executed imminently after refusing an order by the @entity29 of @entity4 to recant his faith			1
' this demonstrates the @entity4 regime 's continued unwillingness to abide by its constitutional and international obligations to respect religious freedom			2
' i pay tribute to the courage shown by @entity56 , who has no case to answer , and call on the @entity4 authorities to overturn his sentence			1
' church officials say there may be as many as 100,000 devoted @entity10 in the country and that @entity4 's leadership is concerned about the spread of @entity2			2
@entity6 was initially charged with protesting , but charges against him were later changed to ' apostasy ' - or abandoning @entity1 - and ' evangelising @entity38 ' , which both carry the death sentence			2
he was later tried and found guilty of apostasy in september 2010 , and sentenced to death by the court in the city of @entity19			0
in june this year the @entity29 of @entity4 upheld the death sentence but asked the lower court in @entity19 , which issued the initial sentence , to re-examine whether or not he had been a practicing @entity38 adult prior to converting to @entity2			0
@entity6 told the court during his first hearing on sunday that he had no intention of returning to @entity1			0
he said : ' repent means to return			1
what should i return to ? to the blasphemy that i had before my faith in @entity84 ? ' however , the court said that because @entity6 has @entity1 ancestry , he therefore must ' recant his faith in @entity84 '			1
when the court ordered him to ' return to the religion of your ancestors - @entity1 ' , @entity6 replied : ' i can not			2
' @entity94 , of advocacy group @entity93 , said : ' this law dictates what should be done with apostates , depending on what type of apostasy has been committed			0
' my sources tell me that the court has been told to give the " apostate " three days to recant , then execute him			1
' mr @entity103 added that section 6.225 of @entity4 's controversial legislation says that if a person 's parents were @entity38 at the time they were trying to conceive a child , and that converts to another religion and renounces @entity1 , he or she would be a national apostate			0
he said : ' the death sentence is the penalty for national apostate , but after the verdict is pronounced , he or she will be commanded to repent of what he or she has done			0
' if he refuses to repent , he will be killed			0
' the written verdict of the @entity29 's decision also included a provision for annulment of the death sentence if pastor @entity6 recanted his faith			2
although the court found that pastor @entity6 was not a practicing @entity38 adult , the court said he remained guilty of apostasy because he had @entity38 ancestry			0
@entity6 's lawyer , @entity132 , told the court that the repeated demand for his client to recant his @entity10 faith violated @entity4 law and its constitution			1
the last @entity4 @entity10 convert from @entity1 executed by the @entity4 government was @entity140 pastor @entity139 in 1990			0
however , several other @entity10 , including at least six @entity142 pastors , are reported to have been assassinated in @entity4 by unknown killers in recent years			0
mr @entity132 said he was hopeful an appeals court would acquit his client			0
he said there was a ' 95 per cent chance ' of acquittal			0
@entity6 turned to @entity2 when he was 19 .			0

' @entity149 means to return . what should i return to ? to the blasphemy that i had before my faith in @entity84 ? '
