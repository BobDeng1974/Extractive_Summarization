@entity0 lost to @entity1 after a well - fought battle at the @entity4 court earlier today			1
the @entity5 may have missed out on the trophy but his fiancée @entity7 , 27 , was on hand to console the tennis champ while @entity1 celebrated his triumph alone as wife @entity11 , 28 , remained at home in @entity13 , with their three - month old son			1
it ’s just the latest on - court meeting between @entity0 and @entity1 and as @entity0 prepares to fly home , we examine how their off - court partners – who share seemingly identical tanned good looks , perfect hair and sparkling engagement rings – match up			1
their partners @entity31 and @entity7 are equally matched			1
@entity32 looks at the @entity33			2
@entity0 's loyal fiancee @entity34 is attracted even more attention courtside today than usual with her statement sweater and long golden locks , a position usually mirrored by @entity1 's wife @entity11 , 28 , were she not needed at home to babysit their young child			1
the two women share many traits - they are both known for their outlandish support of their partners in the bleachers and the press love to follow their fashion choices at every competition			2
the ladies are also both huge dog lovers , close to their family and place an emphasis on maintaining interests outside of their famous partner 's sporting commitments			0
both tennis stars have also widely credited their wags for keeping their feet on the ground in what is an extremely nomadic and fraught career path			1
so @entity32 put the two women head - to - head , to see who wins the @entity66 ( the cup that really matters ) : @entity11 wells up while watching @entity1 at @entity69 in 2011 ( left ) , while @entity34 ( right ) is caught telling one of @entity0 's opponents to to mouth ' f * * * * * g have that , you @entity76 flash f * * * ' at the @entity4 last week @entity79 manner : @entity34 and @entity11 both find it impossible to keep a poker face when watching their partners battle it out on the tennis court			1
the women regularly appear on the brink of tears or react angrily to the decisions made by the umpire			0
@entity11 once said of her inability to control her emotions during competitions : ' you can get very passionate when watching your boyfriend from the players ' box			0
' we just want them to be happy			0
you do n't want to see them in pain			0
if they are not happy , neither are you			0
' just last week , @entity34 was caught on camera mouthing ' f * * * * * g have that , you @entity76 flash f * * * ' at the @entity4 last week to @entity0 's opponent @entity108			1
. @entity34 shows off her diamond engagement ring at the @entity110 last week ( left ) , while a pregnant @entity11 cheers on @entity1 at @entity69 last summer relationship status : @entity0 proposed to his girlfriend of eight years last autumn with a three - carat diamond ring said to be worth around £ 200,000			1
the couple have already been living together in a mansion in @entity117 , @entity118 , for more than three years			0
childhood sweethearts @entity11 and @entity1 married last july in the grounds of @entity123 's exclusive @entity122 resort			2
@entity11 , who was pregnant at the time with the couple 's first child , wore a dressed designed by @entity127 for @entity128			0
the couple have since welcomed their son @entity122 into the world , in october last year , which is the reason that @entity11 is missing from her usual court - side spot at this year 's @entity4			1
@entity1 and @entity11 with their pet toy poodle @entity137 @entity7 with her two border terriers , @entity139 and @entity140 dog points : both @entity11 and @entity34 are animal lovers , but @entity34 definitely takes the doggy biscuit in this leg of the competition			1
@entity11 and @entity1 dote so heavily on their two poodles @entity137 and @entity148 , regularly taking them away on holiday together and sharing their antics on instagram			0
but @entity34 is so devoted to her two border terriers , @entity139 and @entity140 , that they inspired her business - @entity7 , brushes and paws , where she paints portraits of people 's pet dogs			1
@entity34 at @entity69 in 2012 ( left ) and @entity11 at the @entity4 in 2012 ( right ) hair fame : @entity7 fans envy the 27 - year - old as much for her long bouncy locks as for her money - ca n't - buy courtside seats			1
the golden barnet is now so well - known that it has spawned a twitter handle of it 's own - @entity168 , which describes itself as : ' i 'm fabulous			0
i am the gorgeous mane you all love			0
' @entity11 's honey - coloured tresses have reached almost the same level of stardom in her home country of @entity176 , with fashion bloggers regularly commenting on her unruffled appearance during stressful matches			0
@entity181 models for @entity184 's @entity183 range the website for @entity34 's art business - brushes and paws career : in the early days of her relationship with @entity1 , @entity11 was a successful model , starring in several high profile campaigns , including @entity183 ( pictured above )			2
but @entity11 is just as much brains as beauty - she graduated from university in @entity195 with a masters degree and is now working the director 's of the @entity198 , which invests in pre-school education in @entity176			0
after graduating from @entity201 university , @entity7 struggled to find a her ideal job for a couple of years but finally settled on the art world			2
she has established herself as a very successful painter of pet portraits and is commissioned by people from all over the world through her website , brushes and paws			0
@entity211 and @entity11 at the @entity212 show in september 2013 @entity0 sits alongside his girlfriend @entity34 and @entity214 editor @entity211 while they watch the @entity216 show in september 2012 fashion credentials : @entity34 and @entity11 both have the ace card in the fashion stakes - each woman has been photographed @entity222 with none other than @entity211			2
@entity11 was snapped deep in conversation with the @entity214 editor at the @entity227 show in september 2013 , while @entity0 and @entity34 were given the coveted spot next to the taste - maker at the @entity216 show in september 2012 .			2

the tennis stars have fought a close battle throughout their careers
their partners , @entity31 and @entity7 are equally well - matched
