menacing storm clouds gather over green fields and quiet roads , about to embark on a path of destruction			1
like a spaceship hovering above the earth , the cylindrical formation spells trouble for anything in its wake			2
as it sinks closer to the earth , clouds of golden dust are kicked up beneath the gloom by the tornado 's rotating force			2
it 's called @entity19 for a reason : the car and trees in this photo are dwarfed by the gigantic cloud storm chaser @entity25 , 31 , was on an expedition in the @entity27 for 26 days when he came across these cloud formations			2
@entity25 , a system administrator for road weather information , snapped the shots of the three storms in @entity19 in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
from a distance of 1km , he observed the scene for at least an hour at a time , saying the tornados ripped up trees and telephone wires on their journeys			1
the alley 's unique conditions mean tornados form frequently here			0
on cloud nine : storm chaser @entity25 could not believe his luck when he saw these incredible cloud formations dust to dust : huge dust clouds merge with this cloud as it moves across the valley the sun appears to be consumed by the cloud , sucked up by a giant , spinning vortex warm , moist air from the @entity57 meets cold , dry air from the @entity59 and @entity60 , creating intense , tornado - producing thunderstorms known as supercells			1
supercell storms contain a rotating tower , called a mesocyclone , giving the clouds a circular spaceship look			0
@entity25 , from @entity68 , @entity69 , said : ' storm chasing is dangerous as intense lightning , large hail , strong winds and tornadoes could pose threats at any time			0
' i usually observe storms in as safe a position as possible , to avoid any dangerous conditions which could cause us damage or to the vehicle			1
' it usually takes no more than an hour to form a supercell storm which usually brings down trees amd telephone wires			0
' @entity88 can also damage roads and buildings , so it 's important to stay at least 1km away			0
' storm chasing usually means a lot of moving around , remaining in one position for some time and then moving when storm gets closer			0
' the fluffiest ufo in the universe ! this cloud takes on a disc shape similar to classic flying saucers from 1950s sci - fi films @entity103 's the limit : this startling cloud mass completely dominates the sky above the fields			1

the foreboding *phenomena* were *spotted* in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 - and observed from a safe distance
