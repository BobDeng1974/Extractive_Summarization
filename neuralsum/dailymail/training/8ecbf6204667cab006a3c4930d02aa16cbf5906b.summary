by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 02:04 est , 1 may 2013 there should have been plenty to talk about at socialite @entity4 ’s 44th birthday party a few weeks ago			0
it was held in a swanky @entity7 restaurant called @entity8 , and the guest list was eclectic			0
@entity11 @entity10 and his new young bride @entity12 rubbed shoulders with @entity14 and @entity15 , and their mother , the @entity16			0
going public : @entity18 with @entity19 leaving @entity21 's nightclub together last week even @entity23 ’s former squeeze , @entity24 , was spotted doing the rounds			1
but , according to one guest , there was only one topic of conversation that night : what on earth was @entity19 , 33 - year - old @entity32 presenter , doing on the arm of 26 - year - old cake entrepreneur @entity18 , brother of the future @entity34 ? could @entity19 , daughter of a @entity37 builder and an @entity39 manager , and with a child from a previous relationship , really have bagged the duchess of @entity44 ’s baby brother ? as celebrity pairings go , this surely took the biscuit			1
could @entity19 , daughter of a @entity37 builder and an @entity39 manager , and with a child from a previous relationship , really have bagged the duchess of @entity44 ’s baby brother ? as one party guest noted , the pair did n’t much look like a natural couple : ‘ she is pretty , though extremely thin , and obviously much older and more sophisticated than him			1
he is good - looking and tanned , but seemed a little dazed			2
’ as well he might			0
his friends believe he had no idea that going to a party thrown by extrovert @entity4 , who is estranged from her second husband , 77 - year - old hotel magnate @entity63 , would mean his new relationship with @entity19 , seven years his senior , would emerge blinking into the flash bulbs for all to scrutinise			1
clearly , though , @entity18 appears to have conquered these early nerves about being seen with @entity19 in public			1
on monday , the couple were pictured on a cosy daytime date in @entity7 ’s @entity71 , walking @entity18 ’s dog and holding hands			1
cosy : @entity18 with @entity19 in @entity71 on monday and they were pictured last week outside another @entity7 nightclub , @entity21 ’s in @entity8 , after attending a night out with @entity18 ’s sister , @entity78 , and her stockbroker boyfriend , @entity80			1
again , princess @entity14 and @entity16 were also there			0
they have been dating for a few weeks since meeting in @entity84 ’s private members ’ club , 5 hertford street in @entity8 , a favourite for well - connected @entity87			2
@entity18 only likes socialising at parties and private clubs where he wo n’t be watched by inquisitive members of the public			1
aside from @entity78 , to whom he is very close , @entity18 may be reluctant to introduce @entity19 to his family			1
as one of his set put it : ‘ @entity18 will be the only one of his friends to have been out with a @entity96 , with someone who has a child , and who has n’t been to public school			1
' all his friends just date each other and each other ’s sisters			0
’ enjoying some fresh air : @entity18 and @entity19 put on an affectionate display as they wandered around the park another was more blunt : ‘ given that the future monarch is going to spend his or her first weeks in the @entity118 ’ house , no one can quite imagine the reaction to @entity19 arriving on the scene			1
’ indeed , @entity19 ’s journey from child star of tv show @entity123 to @entity124 is something none of his set can quite believe			1
at 26 , @entity18 lives rent - free with @entity78 in @entity129 in a flat bought by his parents			1
he works for his parents ’ party products website in @entity133 , as well as running his @entity134 , which produces cake - making kits and novelty cakes			2
( @entity134 was in the red in its last accounts , but not , according to @entity18 , to a worrying degree			1
) perhaps his business efforts leave him little time for romance , because , since the @entity143 , he has been hard to pin down romantically			2
a few girlfriends have come and gone , including a pretty @entity145 called @entity146 , from whom he split in 2010 ; an unnamed @entity148 interior designer who , like @entity19 , was a few years older than him and , apparently , broke his heart ; and , finally , a @entity153 - based public - school - educated @entity151 model called @entity154			1
like @entity19 , all were angular faced , leggy blondes			1
and , like @entity19 , some of them were not quite the conventional @entity87 types that one might expect — and his mother @entity159 might desire			1
@entity19 ’s romantic history is far more colourful than that of her younger beau			2
she had a long - term relationship with zoo - owning property and gambling millionaire @entity164 , now 52			2
the heir to @entity168 , founder of elite casino the @entity170 , @entity164 was divorced with two children when they met			0
he and @entity19 never married , but have a daughter , @entity172 , now nine			2
the couple separated when @entity172 was four , with friends citing his reluctance to marry again as the reason for the split			0
the @entity118 : @entity159 , @entity18 , @entity178 and @entity78 leaving the @entity179 after the royal wedding in 2011 @entity181 runs @entity182 , the casino chain , but his real love seems to be the gorillas who live in his family zoo , @entity188			2
@entity19 attracted controversy when she planned to let @entity172 , then a small baby , be handed into the gorilla cage at @entity188 to be passed around by the dominant female , as her half - siblings had been			1
after the split , @entity19 moved on to a succession of older , richer men			2
there was @entity198 , the @entity148 @entity7 - based heir to the @entity200 ’s soup fortune , whose wife had gone off with @entity203 ’s best friend , @entity202			0
@entity19 said their relationship was ‘ very serious ’ , but it did n’t last			2
after a brief flirtation with @entity209 ’s son @entity208 , there was @entity210 , a @entity211 - born millionaire who was accused of taking part in a giant vat - dodging scam involving the sale of mobile phones			0
( the case against him was eventually thrown out			0
) as recently as november last year , @entity19 seemed happy on holiday with @entity210 , rubbing sun cream into his back in @entity221			2
but at the end of the year they split			0
@entity18 might not be @entity19 ’s usual established multi-millionaire type , but he certainly has glamorous royal connections and the energy of youth			1
last year saw a few unfortunate headlines for @entity19			2
she spent time in a wheelchair after a car crash damaged her ankle , and was then prosecuted for fraud when she was found to have two simultaneous parking permits for two different boroughs			0
things perked up when her career portfolio was boosted with the launch of her children ’s clothing range at @entity240 and an appearance in @entity244 ’s @entity243 diving show , @entity245 , in january			0
february was notable only for her opening a new branch of the discount fashion store @entity247 in @entity37			0
her website declares that she is a brand ambassador for companies like @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 ’s and has edited organic cookbooks			0
@entity254 is a truly contemporary career path			0
@entity19 has already offered us many thoughts on her idea of romance			1
for a while she wrote a dating blog called @entity262 on a matchmaking website called @entity264			0
her advice included the following : you should n’t ‘ reveal your killer dress until date number three at least ’ ; the perfect date look is trousers , as you feel more in control ; and that ‘ a spray tan , a @entity276 , a vodka and tonic , and high heels ’ are the best ways to beat tiredness before a date			0
she also asked pertinent questions such as : ‘ how do you duck someone ’s tongue lunging towards you without being a total b * * * h ? ’ just as @entity19 is n’t @entity18 ’s only older woman , he is n’t @entity19 ’s only toyboy either			1
@entity288 circles : @entity18 pictured in between mother @entity159 and sister @entity78 at the @entity290 and @entity16 of @entity44 's wedding one online diary entry was entitled ‘ dating with an age gap ’ , and was an account of a night she spent with a 23 - year - old male model ‘ who clearly just want [ ed ] to get laid ’			1
they went to @entity299 , the nightclub haunt of the young royals			0
somehow , she avoided telling the model that she lived with her young daughter			0
she added : ‘ but for the record , yes we did have a bit of a snog			0
sorry , i could n’t resist ! ’ she also expounded further on her ideas of love when she presented a tv programme that would surely turn @entity313 ’s hair grey , entitled @entity314			0
her number one tip was to do a striptease			0
dressing up as @entity318 ’ princess @entity319 also featured highly in her advice			0
thankfully , @entity18 is no prude			2
some of his novelty cakes feature captions such as ‘ jiggly jugs ’ and ‘ yummy bums ’ , and many photographs still circulate on the internet of him semi-naked with his boxer shorts pulled down			0
and while at first glance @entity19 and @entity18 might seem stratospheres apart , their sets do overlap			1
she has many well - connected friends from her days on tv , and her relationship with @entity164 saw her life evolve from @entity339 ’s @entity338 gang to @entity129 / @entity341 grandeur — a scene @entity18 is thoroughly comfortable in			1
his friends include society magician @entity344 , @entity345 and pr girl @entity346			0
both he and @entity19 know @entity14 and @entity15 well , and hop from charity event to @entity350 openings on the social circuit			2
although @entity164 is believed — despite the fact they never married — to have provided for @entity19 to some degree , she can justifiably consider herself a self - made girl who planted herself in the middle of high society through sheer determination			1
in which case , should the relationship spark into full flame against @entity18 ’s friends ’ expectations , @entity159 might find she has more in common with @entity19 than she might think .			1

they made their first public appearance as a couple last week after enjoying a secret three - month romance
now @entity18 and @entity19 look virtually *inseparable*
