scientists investigating the incident believe that someone may have poured only two teaspoons of the poison down a kitchen sink but it was enough to wipe out all the bug life along a ten - mile stretch of the @entity14			1
it killed all the freshwater shrimp , caddis fly and mayfly , leaving trout and other fish with nothing to feed on and in turn hitting predators up the food chain such as otters , kingfishers and herons			1
the pesticide entered the @entity14 , pictured , at @entity29 in @entity30 via a sewage pumping station and affected the river as far downstream as @entity33 in @entity34 the pesticide entered the @entity14 at @entity29 in @entity30 via a sewage pumping station and affected the river as far downstream as @entity33 in @entity34			1
at the height of the alert last month , people were warned not to let river water between the two towns come into contact with their skin , to stop children splashing in it and not to eat the trout caught in it			2
now environment minister @entity47 has ordered his staff at the @entity49 to investigate how the pesticide , chlorpyrifos , can be banned from general domestic use			2
mr @entity47 , who owns a country estate flanking the @entity14 further downstream near @entity54 , said he was alarmed to find ‘ how easy ’ it was to buy the pesticide online			1
‘ i have asked @entity49 to find out why this chemical is so readily available and to suggest what restrictions we should be imposing , ’ he said			2

we want to make sure in the medium to the long term that we are protecting rivers like this from pollution incidents , whether they come from agricultural use or personal use			0
somebody could have just been cleaning out their garden , trying to clean algae out of their fishpond			0
‘ whether we get to prosecutions or not , i do n’t know			0
the important thing is that we look at every aspect of this , making sure that the availability of this chemical is investigated			0
’ the @entity14 , which flows down to @entity54 where it joins the @entity96 , is renowned in angling circles for the purity of its water and the fatness of its trout , and there are syndicates along the river near @entity33 where anglers pay up to £ 3,000 a season for their sport			1
@entity109 is regularly used on lawns and golf courses and to tackle insects on crops and some soft fruits			0
it was banned in @entity116 in 2009 for use in termite control in soil and the @entity120 phased out chlorpyrifos for use in buildings and on construction sites from 2001 due to public health and environmental concerns .			0
