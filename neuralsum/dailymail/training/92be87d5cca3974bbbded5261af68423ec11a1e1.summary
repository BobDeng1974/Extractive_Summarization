@entity0 has quickly established herself as the jungle beauty on @entity3 's i 'm a celebrity ... @entity5 ! - just ask her new admirer , @entity7			1
but the 21 - year - old , who reached the semi-finals of the @entity11 title in @entity12 recently , had a helping hand when it came to appearing bare - faced in the outback			0
we can reveal that @entity0 underwent a series of skin peels , vitamin injections , abdominal toning sessions and micro-needle treatments in preparation for her debut on the show , which was watched by 9.2m viewers			1
tricks of the trade : beauty queen @entity0 , who is currently a star on @entity27 ! , had a helping hand to achieve that bare - faced beauty look for her stint in the outback appearing in public without make - up was something of a personal challenge for @entity0 , who experienced problems with her skin as a teenager			1
' working as model , her face is her fortune so she recently underwent a facial preparation campaign under the professional auspices of dr @entity44 , who is an @entity45 , ' said a spokesman			0
' @entity0 suffered from chronic acne in her late teens and whilst it has left her unscarred , she wanted to ensure it was in peak condition for november , ' explained dr @entity44			1
' her treatment also included a series of skin peels , vitamin injections and micro-needling treatments			2
dr @entity44 told @entity58 : ' signs of stress can show on the skin , even on someone as young as @entity0			1
' beauty queen : @entity0 was treated to a range of treatments from @entity66 , which claims to help enhance your complexion by ridding the face of toxins ' we want to restore her skin radiance and elasticity as well as preventing breakouts and dark circles from forming as a result of excessive stress			1
we want her to look as confident as she feels in her own skin			0
' the 21 - year - old beauty queen has been seeing dr. @entity44 on weekly basis since she was crowned @entity81 in june this year			1
he designed a unique skin treatment for her , named ‘ @entity83 and @entity84 ’			0
involving caviar and bird 's nest extracts , it 's due to be launched to the general public in october , just in time for the festive season			0
@entity0 was also treated to a range of treatments from @entity66			1
dr @entity44 introduced @entity0 to @entity94 , a treatment that claims to stimulate facial circulation , improve complexion and bring about a glowing radiance			2
facing up : @entity0 , who has been getting close to @entity7 on the show ( @entity99 ) , used the @entity100 ( r ) to get her complexion in peak condition for her stint in the jungle ' @entity0 used her @entity94 to improve the circulation , encourage the removal of toxins and ensure she radiates health and vitality from every pore			1
' @entity94 directs electronic muscle stimulation ( @entity66 ) via a headset to encourage natural muscle contractions , so exercising the face involuntarily			0
facial muscles are directly attached to skin and as they are correctly exercised by the @entity94 without contorting the overlying skin , the blood flow to the dermis escalates which increases oxygenation and clears the build - up of toxins speaking about her treatment , @entity0 said : ' @entity94 already gives me a lovely glow after i use it – i just pop on the headset and forget i am treating my face – which is great as i have so many things i have to do at the moment			1
' and @entity0 did n't just concentrate on her face			2
to prepare for the shower shots in the jungle , personal trainer @entity131 designed a training programme to help tone her abdomen			0
as part of this , @entity131 got @entity0 to use a £ 149.99 @entity138 every day for twenty minutes to improve her muscle definition and tone			2
@entity0 wore the belt - which contracts your stomach muscles to give them a work out - while getting ready to go out , as well as in the gym			0
but is @entity0 's beauty blitz safe ? dr @entity148 , cosmetic doctor at @entity149 of @entity150 , said : ' this is a product which uses neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( @entity66 ) in an attempt to contract the muscles on the abdomen			1
this will probably create a similar sort of feeling for the user as is experienced after doing a series of sit ups or abdominal crunches in the gym			0
' but while the technology will probably make the abdominal muscles feel slightly tighter for a few hours after wearing the belt , i am not convinced that we can confidently say the product offers any long - term benefits in terms of toning or tightening the stomach muscles			0
' work out : the belt used by @entity0 creates a similar sort of feeling as is experienced after doing a series of sit ups or abdominal crunches in the gym , says an expert speaking about @entity0 's face treatments , dr @entity180 , @entity181 of 111 @entity150 , said : ' @entity0 is a relatively young @entity66 customer , and at the age of 21 is taking a highly preventive approach to sagging skin			1
' this gadget is most effective on women over the age of 30 , the age when muscle volume and collagen starts to deplete within the face			0
' in terms of safety , the @entity94 is a non invasive treatment that increases blood flow to the skin , a process which will have helped with @entity0 ’s quest for glowing skin			2
however , the @entity94 is not an anti-acne treatment will not necessarily help to keep @entity0 ’s skin spot free			2
' i would recommend that @entity0 maintains a dedicated skincare regime throughout her time in the jungle to avoid breakouts			0

@entity0 , 21 , had skin and tummy toning treatments before show
