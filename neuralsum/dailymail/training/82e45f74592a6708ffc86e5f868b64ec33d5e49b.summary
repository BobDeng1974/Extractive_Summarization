the family of a six - year - old girl with cerebral palsy have condemned ' cruel ' @entity4 bosses after an operation to help her walk was cancelled at the last moment - because of budget cuts			1
@entity8 can only shuffle around on her bottom or take a few slow steps with the aid of a walking frame			1
she was due to have a life - changing operation this friday which would have loosened her muscles to help her walk independently			1
disappointment : @entity8 has cerebral palsy and can only shuffle around on her bottom or take a few slow steps with the aid of a walking frame			1
an operation which would have loosened her muscles to help her walk has now been cancelled but just six days before surgery , her family were dealt a devastating blow when they received a letter informing them that @entity25 had cancelled funding for the operation			1
@entity8 ’s grandmother and full - time carer @entity28 , 42 , said her grand - daughter had also been through a year of painful procedures in preparation for the surgery			1
she said : ' i felt like i had been punched in the stomach when i opened the letter - i was crying and i was heartbroken			0
i could n’t think straight and i was just trying to phone the hospital			0
' after signing the consent form i thought it was a done deal			0
i felt like the whole world had fallen through			0
everything we had done was pointless			0
' @entity8 ’s family are certain the operation would have had a huge impact on her life and have lambasted @entity4 bosses for cancelling funding			1
mrs @entity28 said : ' it would change our lives immensely - it will give her the ability to play with other children , to run in the playground and just to have a better quality of life forever			0
dashed hopes : @entity8 's life - changing surgery has been cancelled with just days to go due to @entity4 ' budget cuts ' , her family have been told ' she would be able to lead an independent life			1
' i ca n’t believe that they will allow surgery for people who have done things to themselves , but not to a child that was born trapped in a disabled body - i ca n’t fathom it			2
' if it can not go ahead , i would take her to any hospital - i would travel to the ends of the @entity75 - one way or another she will have it even if it kills me			0
' she added : ' we now have to raise £ 7,000 to have the operation done privately but it could be even more if we have to fly to @entity81			1
' we are determined to raise the money , we ’ll do anything			2
it feels like hospital have raised our hopes only for them to be cruelly dashed days before the surgery			2
' i am willing to do absolutely anything - i would live on toast and beans forever and i have lined up a loan with my bank			0
' upset : @entity8 with her mother @entity94 ( left ) and grandmother @entity28 , who said : ' i am willing to do absolutely anything for her to get the operation - i would live on beans on toast and have lined up a loan with my bank in case we have to pay for it ourselves ' the procedure - called selective dorsal rhizotomy - can improve mobility and can give a new lease of life to young sufferers			1
doctors cut through nerve connections in the spinal cord - decreasing the messages sent from the brain which relaxes the muscles			2
@entity8 , also lives with her mother @entity94 , 27 , and her three - year - old brother @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119			1
she weighed just over 4lbs when she was born and just 17lbs when she was two - and - a - half - years - old because the cerebral palsy slowed her development			0
she went through years of painful surgery including a brain scan and having a catheter inserted in her spine			2
mrs @entity28 added : ' every aspect of her life i have to do for her			0
she can only walk with me holding her under her arms or with a special frame			1
hope : the procedure @entity8 was due to have is called selective dorsal rhizotomy			1
this can improve mobility and can give a new lease of life to young sufferers ' the hope was the surgery meant she could walk - many children are walking within 12 months unaided - we were hoping we can put in some intense physiotherapy after surgery which we would fund ourselves and get her walking			1
' we had taken her out of school for a week so she did not come into contact with infection , she ’s on antibiotics and she ’s already had her bed moved downstairs so we ’ve got a ready - made ward for her			0
she ’s bright , clever and is a real little character			0
she ’s a very brave girl , she ’s had a lot to put up with and she ’s had a lot of surgery			0
' @entity8 is one of eight children with cerebral palsy who have had operations cancelled just weeks or months in advance at @entity119 hospitals			1
@entity25 said money for the surgery was discontinued last april but @entity8 ’s family have written to the hospital and are planning to appeal the decision			1
unfair : @entity8 is one of eight children with cerebral palsy who have had operations cancelled just weeks or months in advance at @entity119 hospitals a petition against the cancellation has attracted more than 400 signatures in just 24 hours			1
an @entity25 spokeswoman said : “ we are now working with @entity175 to understand why this has taken place and regret any distress which may have been caused to the families affected			2
' health bosses from @entity25 say the procedure was removed from a list of publicly - funded operations in april 2013 after a consultation			2
the treatment was not considered to offer “ value for money or clinical effectiveness ” compared to other procedures			0
dr @entity189 , medical director at @entity175 , said : ' we apologise for the disappointment and distress caused by the cancellation of surgery at such short notice			0
the hospital has apologised for ' the disappointment and distress caused by the cancellation of surgery at such short notice ' ' we had been hopeful that we would reach agreement to continue a funded programme			0
' we have , to date , been unable to secure @entity4 funding and we have therefore , regrettably , had to stop our programme			0
' we continue to explore options which would enable those patients who had received dates for their surgery to have their operation at our hospital			2
' this includes the possibility of parents self - funding the operation			2
we believe that this decision by @entity25 has prompted a number of families across the country to explore self - funding this treatment			1
' we will be discussing with parents alternative treatments that are funded by the @entity4			0

@entity8 can only move around on her bottom or with a frame

@entity234 now fear they will have to raise £ 7,000 for treatment in @entity81
