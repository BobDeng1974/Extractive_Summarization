by @entity1 reporter published : 23:33 est , 1 february 2014 @entity3 : 09:05 est , 2 february 2014 embattled @entity5 governor @entity4 was greeted with audible jeers and a few loud cheers during saturday ’s @entity9 hand - off ceremony , which came on the heels of explosive revelations about the so - called @entity13 scandal			1
the incident cast a pall over @entity4 at what could have been a moment of triumph for the man considered a leading candidate for the @entity22 ’s nomination to run for president in 2016			0
the @entity9 will be played sunday in @entity24 , @entity5			0
the governor 's introduction was met with a chorus of boos interspersed with chants of support from the thousands of people gathered in the area for a @entity9 street fair in @entity34			2
a portion of a huge crowd that gathered in the middle of @entity54 erupted in jeers when @entity4 took the stage during the event marking the ceremonial hand - off of the @entity9 to next year 's host state , @entity59			1
the governor spoke for just over 30 seconds on a large state set up for a group of dignitaries , including @entity59 governor @entity64 , @entity34 mayor @entity65 , @entity47 commissioner @entity66 and other officials			2
‘ i was proud to be in @entity68 last year to accept the hand off on behalf of the region and we look forward to hosting everybody in this group that 's got a ticket tomorrow to watch the greatest sports spectacle in the world , ’ @entity4 said			2
‘ congratulations to the @entity47 and congratulations to the host committee			0
’ not a happy camper : @entity4 appeared sullen as he sat on a stage in the middle of @entity54 with other dignities passing the baton : @entity47 commissioner @entity66 , center , stands between @entity59 gov. @entity86 , left , and gov. @entity4 , right , who show off souvenir helmets after a ceremony to pass official hosting duties of next year 's @entity9 to @entity59 , buck up : the beleaguered government briefly cheered up before leaving the stage without taking any questions from the press the negative public sentiment was unusual for @entity4 , the chairman of the @entity95 who coasted to re-election as governor in november with 60 per cent of the vote			1
in the weeks since starting his second term , @entity4 has been dogged by scandal since it emerged last month that some of his aides and appointees orchestrated traffic jams around the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity5			1
state and federal investigations have been launched into the lane closures in september , which came after the town 's @entity115 mayor declined to endorse the governor 's re-election bid			1
@entity4 has adamantly denied any knowledge of the lane closures and cut ties with two of his top advisers for their apparent role in the scheme			1
@entity127 , @entity4 ’s boyhood friend and one of his appointees at the @entity130 and @entity5 , which managed the bridge , resigned from his post after it emerged he oversaw the closures			1
on friday , an attorney for @entity127 said ‘ evidence exists ’ @entity4 knew of the closures when they were happening			1
the letter did not indicate @entity4 involved himself in the closures in any way , did not specify exactly when he became aware of the jams and offered no evidence to back up the claim			2
famed sense of humor : @entity47 commissioner @entity66 ( left ) is pictured sputtering with laughter in reaction to something the famously irreverent governor might have told him ' evidence exists ... tying mr @entity4 to having knowledge of the lane closures , during the period when the lanes were closed , contrary to what the governor stated publicly in a two - hour press conference , ' stated the letter to the @entity130 and @entity5			1
the missive also claimed that the governor lied to the public during his marathon january 9 press conference			0
during that nationally - televised appearance , @entity4 said he accepted responsibility for the scandal but denied ordering the closures or knowing that they had been orchestrated by his appointees and members of his staff			2
the document also included allegations that the bridge was closed to gain leverage for development deals			0
' there have been reports that certain commissioners of the @entity130 have been connected ... to land deals involving the @entity130 , that @entity130 funds were allocated to projects connected to persons who supported the administration of governor @entity4 , ' the letter reads			1
additionally : ' @entity192 funds were held back from those who refused to support the governor			0
' the three - page letter was written by mr @entity127 's attorney as an attempt to get the @entity130 to pay for his legal bills as several agencies , including the @entity200 , investigate the scandal			1
' i knew nothing about this , ' @entity4 told the nation			2
' and until it started to be reported in the papers about the closure , but even then i was told this was a traffic study			0
' keeping it short : @entity4 spoke for only 33 seconds , thanking the @entity47 and briefly recounting how he accepted the hand - off from @entity214 last year as @entity4 attended @entity9 events saturday , his office fired back against @entity127 with a vigorous defense of the governor			1
the email to the governor 's friends and supporters accused @entity127 of seeking immunity amid an ongoing probe by state lawmakers and a @entity228 attorney into the shutdown			2
‘ bottom line - @entity127 will do and say anything to save @entity127 , ’ the email stated			0
the email entitled ‘ 5 things you should know about the bombshell that 's not a bombshell , ’ was posted on the political news website @entity239 and confirmed by @entity240 , a spokesman for the governor			0
the email also took aim at @entity127 's credibility after he claimed that he could ‘ prove the inaccuracy ’ of some of @entity4 's denials			1
the letter describes the order to close the lanes as coming from ‘ the @entity4 administration , ’ but does not say that @entity4 himself orchestrated the closures in any way			2
@entity4 's team denied that @entity4 knew about the traffic jam or its political motive until after it was over and bashed @entity127 on a variety of fronts , characterizing him as a litigious teenager , a controversial mayor of @entity261 , where @entity4 and @entity127 attended high school together , and for his past career as an anonymous political blogger			1
much of the letter quoted newspaper articles that took critical looks at @entity127 , who resigned in december from a $ 150,000 - per - year job that he got with @entity4 's blessing			1
blame game : @entity127 , who personally oversaw the @entity109 lane closures , says he has evidence that @entity4 lied telling the truth ? @entity4 staked his reputation on a january 9 press conference in which he repeatedly denied knowing about the closures or having any involvement the @entity4 email notes that a 2012 article in @entity280 of @entity281 says @entity127 ‘ was a very contentious person			1
’ @entity4 said he was blindsided by his advisers ' involvement and promised to cooperate with various state and federal investigations			0
local newspapers on saturday said the governor 's political career could be doomed if it was proven he knew in advance of the four days of lane closures that caused massive delays for commuters , ambulances and school buses			1
the @entity297 said in an editorial that @entity4 now ‘ stands on the brink of ruin ’ if he can not defend himself against the latest claims			0
‘ in that event , @entity4 's governorship is over and he should prepare to face a federal criminal probe as a private citizen			2
@entity307 would be a must			0
otherwise , impeachment would be a snap , ’ it said			0
@entity311 , a columnist for the @entity280 , a major @entity5 newspaper , wrote today that if @entity127 produces evidence that ‘ turns out to be the damning , incontrovertible kind , then @entity4 's career will be in tatters , if not over			1
’ @entity316 : governor @entity4 attended a birthday party for shock - jock @entity316 on friday shortly after @entity127 's attorney 's letter emerged , the @entity4 administration said it contained nothing to contradict @entity4 's position that the governor had ‘ no prior knowledge ’ of the closures			1
a bipartisan committee of state lawmakers is investigating the episode , as is the office of @entity332 , the @entity228 attorney for @entity5			0
@entity127 is among 20 people and organizations close to @entity4 who must comply with a new round of subpoenas by monday			2

@entity4 arrived at the @entity345 in @entity346 about 6:30 p.m. - after his motorcade zipped past reporters			0
just before 7pm , the governor took the stage at the party to wish ' @entity352 ' a happy birthday - and to introduce @entity5 native @entity353 , joking that he is not the ' representative from @entity5			0
' ' the representative of @entity5 you want to see right now ... is one of @entity5 's favorite sons , one of my good friends , and a great artist ' @entity4 said			0
' ladies and gentlemen , @entity343			0
' joker : comedian @entity365 joked with the governor , asking ' how was the traffic ' on his way to the party all but two lanes of the @entity110 approach to the @entity109 were closed for four days in september - paralyzing the borough and frustrating tens of thousands of commuters @entity353 performed his 1987 hit ' @entity374 , and @entity4 left the event shortly after 7pm			1

' a surprise guest at @entity316 's birthday was governor @entity4			1
i asked him how the traffic was coming in , ' @entity386 joked			0
@entity4 , who has a reputation for engendering loyalty and insisting on discipline among his subordinates , explained at a december news conference that he learned of his aides ' involvement when an original batch of subpoenaed emails was published			0
backup : the gridlock caused by the lane closures led to major traffic problems in @entity110 - including delays for ambulances and police officers			1

on friday , @entity4 's *childhood* friend @entity127 *announced* he had proof governor knew about lane closures at @entity109

@entity127 is a former @entity130 official who personally oversaw the traffic *disturbance*
this is the first signal @entity4 may have been directly involved in the closure
