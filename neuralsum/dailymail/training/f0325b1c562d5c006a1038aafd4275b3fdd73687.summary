by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:38 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 19:32 est , 17 october 2012 @entity2 was clinging to his job last night as @entity4 struggled to contain open revolt over his future			2
the chief whip was effectively put on probation as he was ordered to try to ‘ rebuild relations ’ with mps furious at the controversy caused by his row with @entity4 police			1
the abrasive cabinet minister caused further consternation by appearing to change his story – insisting he did not swear at officers who told him he should use a side gate rather than have the main entrance specially opened for him and his bicycle			2
under - fire chief whip @entity2 shouted across the @entity22 that he did not swear at police , but the row refuses to go away mr @entity2 ’s deputy @entity24 had to be talked out of quitting last night , and sources said at least one other whip – whose job is to maintain party discipline – was considering resigning rather than work under him			1
previously , mr @entity2 ’s allies had not disputed that he swore during the altercation , though they firmly reject police claims that he called officers ‘ plebs ’ and ‘ morons ’			2
the chief whip had been understood to be claiming that he told an officer : ‘ you guys are supposed to * * * * ing help us			1
’ labour leader @entity41 used prime minister ’s questions to claim mr @entity2 is ‘ toast ’ and accuse @entity44 of ‘ total double standards ’ for supporting police in arresting yobs who swear at officers but refusing to sack his own minister			1
but sitting on the government frontbench , the chief whip was seen mouthing the words : ‘ i did n’t swear			1
’ @entity52 leader @entity41 accused @entity44 of ' total double standards ' for not sacking mr @entity2 @entity55 mp @entity54 , a whip until last month ’s reshuffle , said : ‘ several mps have confirmed to me that @entity2 did indeed say “ i did n’t swear ”			1
‘ this puts a whole new light on the issue			0
@entity52 were never going to let the story go away , but now he has managed to re-ignite it himself			2
’ at a meeting of the backbench 1922 committee last night , five mps – @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 – openly questioned mr @entity2 ’s position			0
another three said they felt he should have resigned earlier on and they were only backing him because it would be even messier to throw him overboard now			0
the prime minister ( left ) and the @entity41 went head to head in the @entity22 for the first time since mr @entity2 lost his temper after being told he could not ride his bike through the main gates of @entity4 mr @entity68 complained the row had become so widely discussed that he had had to listen to sermons in church on mr @entity2 ’s behaviour			1
however , more than ten mps , including @entity87 , chairman of the public administration committee , spoke in his favour			0
sources said the mood had largely been against giving the @entity92 – which has been waging a campaign to force mr @entity2 out of his job – a scalp			0
some mps said they felt sorry for mr @entity2 because he appeared to have lost weight and now cuts a ‘ pitiful figure ’			0
one senior source said the chief whip would now have to work hard to build credibility with @entity96			1
in a less than resounding endorsement of mr @entity2 ’s position , a senior figure in the party admitted that his job was safe only because ‘ no new facts ’ have emerged in the last month and that mps judged it would have been ‘ a messy ending ’ to see him quit now			0
mr @entity2 ranted at officers after being told he to get off his bike and use a side exit to leave @entity4 in the @entity22 , mr @entity41 pointed to mr @entity2 and insisted he should have been arrested			1
‘ while it is a night in the cell for the yobs , it is a night at the @entity115 for the chief whip			1
is n’t that the clearest case there could be of total double standards ? ’ he said			1
‘ his position is untenable			0
in other words , he is toast			0
’ mr @entity44 replied : ‘ what the chief whip did and said were wrong			1
i am absolutely clear about that			0
that is why it was important that the chief whip apologised and that apology was accepted			2
’ last night mr @entity2 ’s denial that he swore at the police was challenged by officers who met with him to discuss the incident			0
@entity132 , of the @entity133 , tweeted : ‘ having been in the meeting with @entity2 on friday and having asked questions , i am now confused – he told us he did swear ! ’ cabinet minister @entity137 said : ‘ @entity138 are trying to remind us they are a powerful trade union			2
most people have at some time lost their temper , said something they should not , and had to apologise fairly abjectly afterward when they felt ashamed of themselves			0

the chief whip *heckled* @entity52 leader @entity41 to insist he did not swear
@entity41 says minister is ' toast ' and accuses *pm* of ' total double standards '
*ex-tory* whip @entity54 says @entity2 has ' *reignited* ' the controversy
