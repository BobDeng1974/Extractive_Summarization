under the sea : the divers claim that they enjoy swimming with smaller fish because they tend to be quite interactive unbelievable encounters : here , one of the deep sea divers is photographed alongside a gigantic whale shark no fear ! the divers are not afraid to get very close with great white sharks ' we need to be very calm , but they are not the terrifying animals we imagine them to be , just a wild animal			1
' of course i can feel afraid in the ocean , especially when there is no visibility - even if there are no animals around			0
' i think it is certainly due to the @entity56 movie - but when the water is clear , there is absolutely no problem			0
' @entity10 says : ' @entity32 are generally shy and curious , we almost never feel afraid or nervous when we swim with them ' @entity10 and @entity9 explain that while you need to be careful , great whites are not the terrifying creatures we imagine them to be in fact , the two even attribute people 's nervousness around the creatures to the @entity56 film franchise the divers do admit to being more afraid in dark water , but if the water is clear , they have no problems the stunning collection of images were taken during trips to widespread locations , including the @entity77 , @entity78 in @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
and the pair have witnessed first hand the beauty of some of other , perhaps less dangerous , animals - including blue sharks , whale sharks , leopard seals and hordes of fish			1

' i like them all ! ' ' but the big ones are certainly much more impressive , purely for their size			0
' for example , though a whale shark is not really interactive , they are so big that they inspire a great force			2
whereas some little fish can be much more interactive			0
' diving with marine mammals is great - it is almost like we can understand them			0
' ' diving with marine mammals is great , ' they say			0
