by @entity0 @entity3 sea ice may not be expanding as rapidly previously thought - with much of the increase potentially down to a data error , scientists have said			1
while @entity8 sea ice has been melting significantly in recent years , satellite observations suggest sea ice cover in the southern hemisphere has been increasing and has reached record highs in the past few years			2
the increase in @entity3 sea ice despite rising global temperatures has puzzled scientists and been highlighted by climate change sceptics as evidence of flaws in the theory of man - made global warming			1
@entity3 sea ice may not be expanding as rapidly previously thought - with much of the increase potentially down to a data error , scientists have said			1
a 2007 international assessment of climate science by the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) found that @entity3 sea ice cover remained constant between 1979 and 2005			1
but more recent research and the latest assessment by the @entity25 , published in the last year , suggests that southern hemisphere sea ice extent increased at a rate of about 16,500 square kilometres ( 6,370 square miles ) a year between 1979 and 2012			2
the difference has been attributed to adding more years to the data			0
however , now researchers say there is a ' significant ' error in one of the reports			0
the hole in the ozone layer , increases in freshwater from melting glaciers , winds and natural variability are among the theories put forward for the growth in @entity3 sea ice , which appears to be increasing at a third of the rate the @entity8 ’s sea ice is retreating			1
but now research published in the @entity53 journal @entity54 suggests that much of the measured expansion could be down to a previously undocumented error in the way satellite data was processed			0

the difference has been attributed to adding more years to the data			0
but lead author of the new paper , @entity68 of the @entity69 at the @entity70 , @entity71 , said : ' when we looked at how the numbers reported for the trend had changed , and we looked at the time series of @entity3 sea ice extent , it did n’t look right			1
' he added : ' our findings show that the data used in one of the reports contains a significant error			0
' but we have not yet been able to identify which one contains the error			0
' the data for sea ice cover is sourced from observations by a number of different instruments on a number of satellites , with scientists using a mathematical formulae and further processing to calculate what the extent of the sea ice is from the readings			2
the researchers compared two datasets , calculated with different versions of the formula , which were used in the two @entity25 assessments			0
@entity3 ice maps for september 2009 until september 2012 reveal an increase in the level of sea ice the study shows a difference between the the datasets , relating to a change in satellite sensors in december 1991 and the way the data from the two instruments was calibrated			1
prof @entity68 said : ' it appears that one of the records did this calibration incorrectly , introducing a step - like change in december 1991 that was big enough to have a large influence on the long - term trend			0
' he said it is not readily apparent which record contains the step change			0
but by comparing the datasets and calculating @entity3 sea ice extent for each of them , the researchers discovered that the newer assessment gave larger rates of sea ice expansion than the old one in any given period			2
they found the large increase in the reported rate of @entity3 sea ice expansion since the @entity25 assessment in 2007 was down to the effect of a change in the way the observations were processed , rather than due to adding more years of data			1
but the researchers said they could not tell if the change corrected a problem or introduced one			0
if it introduced a problem , the rate of @entity3 sea ice expansion could have been overestimated - potentially solving the puzzle of why @entity3 sea ice has been recorded as increasing to such an extent despite rising global temperatures .			1
