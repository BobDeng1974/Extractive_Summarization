if you ’re keen to learn a new language , or improve your number skills , a new app claims to make you a pro in a matter of weeks			2
the free @entity8 @entity7 app teaches languages , history , plus a range of other tailored subjects - and independent tests found it can even double maths skills in 14 days			1
each question takes two to three seconds to answer and the device ’s screen ca n’t be unlocked until the correct answer is entered			1
each question takes two to three seconds to answer and the device ’s screen ca n’t be unlocked until the correct answer is entered but if the phone needs to be accessed quickly , or in an emergency , questions can be skipped			1
the app was created by @entity34 - based developers @entity35 and @entity36			1
researchers from the @entity38 recently carried out an independent experiment to test the effectiveness of the @entity42 app. they studied more than three million responses , from 13,285 participants , who used the app between 15 february and 11 june 2013			1
the experiments looked at the accuracy and speed at which users answered maths ’ questions			2
they concluded that users , on average , doubled their performance times and accuracy over a two - week period			0
its algorithm learns from individual users ’ answer patterns to ensure that questions are always matched to individual aptitudes			0
this means that the app is able to teach users just as effectively as other methods , but in significantly less time , claim the developers			0
@entity42 initially focused on vocabulary and mathematics questions , but it has recently launched a content marketplace that lets users add extra subjects , and customise their learning packs , for free			1
for example , if a student has a @entity73 vocabulary quiz at the end of each week , they can add the specific words they have learnt into the app and only be tested on those			0

mr @entity35 said : ‘ in a time of information overload , processing abundant content has become a pain point for many people who want to learn , but do n’t know where to begin			0
‘ @entity8 breaks down information into bite - sized pieces			0
it makes learning and training an implicit part of people ’s days - without requiring the motivation or organisation to reserve a time to study			1
' this has resulted in faster learning speeds and proven retention rates			0
’ the firm told @entity114 it is working on releasing the app on other platforms , including @entity117 and @entity118 , early next year			0
