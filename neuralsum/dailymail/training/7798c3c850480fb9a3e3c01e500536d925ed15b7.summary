a mother of a student whose body was found on a motorway in @entity4 12 years ago believes he was tortured by a right wing cult in the days before his death			1
@entity8 says her 22 - year - old son @entity9 , from north @entity10 , died after attending a youth event organised by the far - right ' cult '			1
the @entity4 police concluded that his death was ' a suicide by means of a traffic accident '			1
but the @entity19 student 's family have never accepted that ruling and in may 2010 the @entity21 ordered a fresh @entity23 inquest after judges said evidence of possible foul play must be investigated			1
today it was announced the inquest will start next march			0
campaign : @entity8 , 22 , was found dead on a @entity4 motorway in 2003 in an apparent suicide but his mother @entity32 has successfully fought for a new inquest @entity9 , a student at the @entity23 institute and the @entity36 , went from @entity37 to @entity38 in @entity4 to join what he believed was a protest against the war in @entity42			1
his mother believes @entity9 began to be aware and criticise the virulent anti-semitic views of the group			1
mrs @entity46 struggled to hold back tears as she told a pre-inquest hearing what she had learned about the ' dangerous ' techniques used by groups like these to control their members , and the unwillingness of the @entity4 investigators to look into it			1
@entity9 , a student at the @entity23 institute and the @entity36 , went from @entity37 to @entity4 and was staying in this apartment block @entity57 before he died she told @entity58 : ' in the past 11 years there has been an unwillingness to look at the danger that can cause an innocent person like @entity9 to become a victim			1
this is a danger i was ignorant of			0
' there has been an unwillingness to look at what the danger is			0
this is the danger that leads to extremism , which is particularly common today , the danger that leads young people to become suicide bombers and destroys communities ' this is what is called in @entity37 mental manipulation and subjugation , and which with the rise of social media and new techniques becomes very dangerous			1
' trying to find out what happened to @entity9 might help people shake off this fear and its different forms			0
' there has been an unwillingness to look into the psychological harm caused to him			0
' during the hearing , she also accused the @entity4 investigators of ' time wasting ' in order to ensure the case was not properly investigated			2
she said she had asked repeatedly for @entity4 to send a mutual aid request to @entity37 to allow the courts to access evidence into @entity9 's death , but during a recent visit to @entity37 she discovered the requests had not been received			1
she said : ' there has been terrible time wasting			0
the case started in @entity37 , there is a law in @entity37 , @entity108 , which makes what happened to @entity9 in terms of the mental manipulation a crime			2
' i spoke to the highest @entity37 authorities to see if they had received the mutual aid request from @entity4 , they had heard nothing			1
' they are hoping to delay the inquest by dragging the investigation on			0
the same person who destroyed evidence in the first investigation is holding this one up			0
' coroner @entity125 ruled there was enough evidence for an inquest to be carried out and set a date for march 17 next year			2
tragedy : mr @entity131 died in @entity4 in 2003 and was found here on @entity133 , the @entity134 , near @entity38 he said : ' i have no doubt the inquest should proceed			1
but i am not here to investigate the investigators			0
i am here to determine the circumstances behind @entity8 's death			2
' mrs @entity46 expressed her relief that , after nearly 15 years since her son died , she might finally have answers			1
she told the court : ' this inquest will expose the dangers of what happened to @entity9 and will mean his family wo n't have to go on struggling and will allow his family to come to terms with his death			0
' after the hearing she added the @entity4 legal system was ' broken '			2
she said : ' it is clear his death has not been investigated			0
in my view @entity4 's higher court has no method of ensuring the investigation will be carried out			2
' i am glad the inquest will be held and the time has come to expose the danger he faced			0
' speaking after the hearing she claimed : ' my son was subjected to sleep deprivation , mental manipulation and other coercive techniques			0
i have evidence @entity9 was subjected to that from his lecture notes and briefings			0

@entity8 , 22 , *killed* himself in 2003 , the @entity4 authorities said
@entity36 student travelled from @entity37 to @entity4 for @entity183 protest
mother @entity32 believes he was ' mentally ' tortured by a far - right group before he died
mrs @entity46 believes right - wing group targeted him because he was @entity19
she has fought for a new inquest for her son , which will be held next year
