by @entity0 last updated at 9:51 pm on 20th february 2012 @entity1 cut off oil sales to @entity4 companies yesterday after foreign secretary @entity5 accused the @entity7 regime of promoting terrorism			1
the oil ministry in @entity10 announced that it had ceased all sales to the @entity4 and @entity12 , escalating diplomatic tensions triggered by @entity1 ’s nuclear programme			1
the move will have little effect on @entity4 firms , which get well under 1 per cent of their oil from @entity1 since the @entity19 has already slapped sanctions on the country and has vowed to stop buying all @entity1 oil by july			2
@entity1 was supplying more than 700,000 barrels a day to the @entity19 last year but this had already been cut back by 300,000 before yesterday ’s move			2
diplomacy : @entity5 has warned @entity26 today that military action against @entity1 would not be ' a wise thing ' nevertheless it represented another ratcheting up of tensions			1
the action came less than 48 hours after mr @entity5 accused @entity1 of threatening a new nuclear @entity33 in the @entity35			1
yesterday the foreign secretary accused the government of @entity38 of plotting terrorist outrages around the world			1
he said there was ‘ no specific information ’ about a threat to the @entity44 from any @entity10 - backed terrorists			0
in a further escalation of rhetoric , @entity1 ’s state - run news agency suggested the country was capable of sinking @entity4 warships in the @entity51			2
in a report published yesterday , it said it was ‘ @entity4 that would suffer unwelcome consequences if it joins its mentors in the @entity58 and the @entity26 regime to attack @entity1 ’			1
@entity60 , a spokesman for the oil ministry said : ' exporting crude to @entity4 and @entity12 companies has been stopped ... we will sell our oil to new customers			0
' the decision comes after @entity19 member states had agreed to stop importing @entity1 crude from july			2
the agreement was intended to pressure @entity1 to stop enriching uranium over increasing concerns of its nuclear programme			1
in an interview with @entity77 ’s @entity76 , the foreign secretary repeated his warning that a nuclear - armed @entity1 would result in another cold war in the @entity35			1
' they would either be attacked and there would be a war , or there would be a cold war in which @entity1 for the long term would be subject to these very intense economic sanctions and they would find that other nations in their region developed nuclear weapons , ' he said			1
aggression : mr @entity5 's warning today follows rumours that the @entity26 government is considering strikes against @entity1 within months			1
pictured is @entity26 prime minister @entity98 but he urged against military action , although he said it was not ruled out as an option			2
' i do n’t think a wise thing at this moment is for @entity26 to launch a military attack on @entity1 , ' he said			1
' i think @entity26 like everyone else in the world should be giving a real chance to the approach we have adopted on very serious economic sanctions and economic pressure and the readiness to negotiate with @entity1			1
' that ’s what we need to make a success of			0
' mr @entity5 said @entity26 did not share its plans with @entity4			2
' we do not take any options off the table , we do n’t know how the situation will develop , it would be unwise to do that , ' he said			0
' but our approach is 100 per cent diplomatically and economically focused to bring @entity1 to the negotiating table			2
' the @entity58 also pushed @entity26 not to strike @entity1 , with @entity126 chairman gen @entity125 leading the @entity58 call for restraint			1
mr @entity5 said there was ' no specific information ' about a threat to the @entity44 from any @entity10 - backed terrorists			0
but he acknowledged : ' clearly @entity1 has been involved increasingly in illegal and potentially terrorist activity in other parts of the world			0
' i think @entity1 has increased its willingness to contemplate utterly illegal activities in other parts of the world			0
this is part of the danger that @entity1 is presenting to the peace of the world			0
' developments : @entity1 's president @entity38 watches from a control room as nuclear fuel rods are loaded into the @entity148 on wednesday shadow foreign secretary @entity149 called for ' calm heads and clear thinking ' , but said @entity1 needed to feel the international community ’s ' full force '			1
he told @entity153 ’ @entity155 programme : ' the right approach at this stage is to push forward the twin - track approach : on the one hand offering genuine engagement , on the other hand tightening the peaceful pressure , strengthening the sanctions that are being felt at the moment			0
' when the international community says , " all options need to be left on the table " , i agree			0
mr @entity149 said the government should focus not on ' raising the rhetoric , but on redoubling their efforts to secure a diplomatic and peaceful outcome '			0
diplomats also warned today that @entity1 is poised to greatly expand uranium enrichment at a fortified underground bunker to a point that would boost how quickly it could make nuclear warheads			1
they said @entity10 had put finishing touches for the installation of thousands of new - generation centrifuges at the cavernous bunker - machines that can produce enriched uranium much more quickly and efficiently than its present machines			2
worrying : president @entity38 , second left , visit @entity10 's nuclear reactor on wednesday where he introduced three new nuclear projects while saying that the electrical circuitry , piping and supporting equipment for the new centrifuges was now in place , the diplomats emphasised that @entity10 had not started installing the new machines at its @entity197 facility and could not say whether it was planning to			2
still , the senior diplomats - who asked for anonymity because their information was privileged - suggested that @entity10 would have little reason to prepare the ground for the better centrifuges unless it planned to operate them			0
they spoke in recent interviews - the last one yesterday			0
the reported work at @entity197 appeared to reflect @entity1 ’s determination to forge ahead with nuclear activity that could be used to make atomic arms despite rapidly escalating international sanctions and the latent threat of an @entity26 military strike on its nuclear facilities			1
@entity197 could be used to make fissile warhead material even without such an upgrade , the diplomats said			0
they said that although older than @entity1 ’s new generation machines , the centrifuges now operating there can be reconfigured within days to make such material because they already are enriching to 20 per cent - a level that can be boosted quickly to weapons - grade quality			1
their comments appeared to represent the first time anyone had quantified the time it would take to reconfigure the @entity197 centrifuges into machines making weapons - grade material			0
moving forward : @entity1 state tv shows centrifuges at @entity235 nuclear site			2
diplomats warned today that @entity10 had put the finishing touches on the installation of thousands of new - generation centrifuges at a underground bunker in contrast , @entity1 ’s older enrichment site at @entity235 is producing uranium at 3.4 per cent , a level normally used to power reactors			1
while that too could be turned into weapons - grade uranium , reassembling from low to weapons - grade production is complex , and retooling the thousands of centrifuges at @entity235 would probably take weeks			0
the diplomats ’ comments come as @entity253 inspectors are due to visit @entity10 today			0
their trip - the second this month - is another attempt to break more than three years of @entity1 stonewalling about claims that it has - or is - secretly working on nuclear weapons that would be armed with uranium enriched to 90 per cent or more			1
@entity1 says it is enriching only to make nuclear fuel			1
but because enrichment can also create fissile warhead material , the @entity263 @entity262 has imposed sanctions on @entity10 in a failed attempt to force it to stop			0
more recently , the @entity58 , the @entity19 and other @entity269 allies have either tightened up their own sanctions or rapidly put new penalties in place striking at the heart of @entity1 ’s oil exports lifeline and its financial system			0
the most recent squeeze on @entity1 was announced on friday , when @entity278 - based @entity277 , a financial clearing house used by virtually every country and major corporation in the world , agreed to shut out the @entity283 from its network .			0
