by @entity0 published : 18:58 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 19:10 est , 7 january 2014 attack : former minister @entity3 has blasted @entity6 's @entity5 administration for giving rise to the betting crisis across the @entity9 today @entity5 ‘ dropped the ball ’ by giving the green light to fixed odds betting terminals dubbed the ‘ crack cocaine ’ of the @entity15 , a leading @entity5 mp said last night			1
former minister @entity3 said @entity5 ‘ should never have licensed these machines ’ as his party prepares today to force a @entity19 vote on the issue			1
@entity21 - who want a crackdown on the betting machines - will be challenged to back a @entity5 motion calling for councils to get the right to ban the terminals if they cause problem gambling and anti-social behaviour			1
but mr @entity3 said fixed odds terminals , which allow punters to lose up to £ 300 a minute on computer roulette , should never have been licensed in the gambling of @entity35			1
he told the @entity38 ’s @entity37 show : ‘ there ’s a body of evidence that these particular kind of machines create in gambling addicts , and that ’s something that @entity45 should act on			1
' frankly we [ @entity5 ] should never really have licensed these machines in the way we did in 2005 and we should put the matter right as quickly as possible			2
‘ at the time all mps let this category of machines go through almost on the nod			0
our concern was supercasinos and the machines that go into supercasinos			0
‘ we basically dropped the ball on this one			0
we did n’t understand the impact this technology would have on the @entity15			0
now ’s the time to put it right			0
’ campaigners say there is academic evidence that the fixed odds machines are more addictive than other forms of gambling and say they are used by criminals to launder their money			2
but ministers have refused to act until a review into betting machines is completed this autumn - a review that critics complain has been funded by the gambling industry			2
mr @entity3 said waiting for the review is ‘ like waiting for the polar ice caps to melt -- we ’ve been waiting years for this ’			0
punters lose up to £ 300 a minute on computer roulette games in high street betting shops like @entity80 there are more than 33,000 @entity82 in @entity9 , with up to four in each high street betting shop			1
the so - called @entity85 machines made bookmakers £ 1.55billion last year - around half their annual profits -- with up to £ 1.2 billion of that coming from the fixed odds games			2
@entity90 has announced that a future @entity5 government would give councils the power to ban high - stakes roulette machines from bookmakers ’ shops if they pose problems in their communities			1
@entity5 also plan to change the law so the time between plays is doubled from 20 to 40 seconds and put betting shops in a separate planning class so that councils can use planning powers to control the number opening in their area			1
that last idea was endorsed by the @entity21 at their party conference last september			2
@entity109 sports minister @entity109 challenged the @entity21 to back @entity5 ’s motion in the @entity19 today : ‘ across the country , traditional bookies are being turned into mini-casinos , where people can gamble up to £ 300 - a - minute			1
saturday 's mail : we went to get a first - hand view of the crippling effects of fixed - odds betting terminals the next @entity5 government will give powers to local communities to ban high stakes gambling machines from high streets			1
‘ over recent months , we ’ve seen the @entity126 and @entity21 posturing on fixed odds betting machines , but totally failing to act			2
‘ if the @entity126 and @entity21 refuse to back @entity5 ’s proposals they ’ll have to answer why they are standing up for the large betting companies rather than communities across the country			1
’ but former @entity21 leader @entity133 made clear that his party would not back @entity5 ’s motion because they are waiting for the review to conclude			1
@entity133 : ‘ i just think this is pre-emptive and premature			0
i have every sympathy with @entity3 ’s argument and i hope the review will endorse it up this is putting the cart before the horse			0
it ’s procedural not principled			0
’ @entity145 , of the @entity146 , said : ‘ gaming machines in betting shops are not new , they have been enjoyed by our customers for over 12 years			0
‘ this motion is just playing politics with the livelihoods of 40,000 staff and the enjoyment of eight million people			0
‘ our new code for responsible gambling introduces new measures that will reduce harm , letting players set their own limits on the time they play or the amount they spend			0
‘ banning a product for a political punch line does nothing to help problem gambler			0
