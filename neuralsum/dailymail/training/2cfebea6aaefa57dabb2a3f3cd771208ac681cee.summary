and the storms will quickly move across the rest of @entity1 , with the @entity16 set to see as much as 30mm in a single hour tomorrow			1
coming to an end : the gorgeous weather in places such as @entity22 , @entity19 is not forecast to survive the weekend glee : but the likes of six - year - old @entity25 do not have much longer to enjoy the lavender fields of @entity1 before rain comes harvesting : teenager @entity28 picks lavender at @entity30 in @entity22 today summery : plants have thrived in the weather but the sunshine is set to end for the time being the tornado which struck @entity37 in @entity38 yesterday afternoon left residents cowering in fear as the twister ripped through the village			1

' i was sitting in the living room , ' said @entity55 , 69			0
' the next thing i knew the fire place started shaking as if it was going to collapse			0
' i did n’t know what was happening , but i got up and looked out the living room window			0
i saw loads of roof tiles flying around and crashing down into the street			0
' the whole thing lasted around a minute and after it was over lots of neighbours came out to help clear up the mess in the street			0
' twister : a tornado was pictured over the village of @entity37 in @entity38 yesterday as @entity1 faces storms in many parts damage : car windscreens were smashed after debris flew around the town thanks to the sudden storm roof : tiles were ripped off this home in @entity37 by the vicious tornado which swept through the village yesterday destruction : trees had branches torn off them in the storm , which foreshadows a weekend of bad weather @entity87 , 25 , who filmed the terrifying event , added : ' i had just been at a meeting for work when i came out and realised it was very windy			1

' i looked up and could see the winds spiralling and could make out debris being sucked up and spinning about			0
' despite the sunny weather which has been prevailing in most of @entity1 for the past week , the @entity102 has warned that many areas face a sudden downpour tomorrow			2
the @entity16 will bear the brunt of the rain , with 30mm forecast to fall within an hour - compared to an average rainfall of 78.1mm in the whole month of july			1
by the seaside : brightly coloured beach huts pictured in @entity111 today as visitors soaked up the sunshine spectacle : the @entity111 huts were first introduced more than 100 years ago and were looking at their best today ominous : this weekend is set to bring heavy rain and storms across most of @entity1 following the heatwave a @entity102 spokesman said : ' it ’s going to be very wet over the weekend for some and we have a warning out for saturday , as the @entity16 and @entity124 receive a band of thunderstorms and heavy rain that is moving northwards from @entity128			1
' then on sunday we have another warning for the @entity130 and south - west @entity131 as well as the @entity132 and @entity133 , the @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 and the @entity137 as well			2
' but the downturn in conditions does n’t necessarily herald the end of summer and a return to the typically wet @entity1 climate			1
the spokesman said : ' it looks like july is going to end with unsettled conditions , but outside those areas temperatures will be normal for this time of year			2
dry : the lack of rain this month has affected the soil in which crops are grown , such as this wheat field in @entity153 longing for rain : farmers and gardeners are likely to welcome the prospect of wet weather this weekend ' compared to the last couple of weeks , temperatures will be lower , but will still be mainly near or perhaps a little above average for the time of year			1
' as a result conditions will feel fresher , especially at night , but it should still feel pleasantly warm in the sunshine			0
' over the weekend outside the areas where there are storms and showers it will be around 26 in the south east , mid 20s in central parts and around 20/21 in the south west			0
