how can it be that in 2014 , fully 18 years into the professional game , @entity1 are going to play a three - match test series in @entity4 and are being prevented from picking their strongest team for the vital first test ? those missing players represent the biggest cock - up since the ' @entity9 ' in 1998 ! i inherited a crazy itinerary that year when , in very quick succession , an under - strength squad had to play @entity14 , @entity4 a , @entity15 , the first @entity16 , @entity4 @entity17 in midweek , the second test and then take a 16 - hour flight to play @entity20 in @entity21			1
that itinerary was put together by somebody who did n't put the @entity1 team first			2
@entity22 ( @entity1 's current coach ) is having to leap through logistical hoops when this battle should have been fought - and won - a long time ago			1
do not think for one minute this is just one of those things and wo n't happen again			0
the @entity37 has started to flex its muscles , as we have seen in the recent @entity41 negotiations			0
@entity1 should always comes first if you want to win a @entity43			1
the visit by @entity1 will be a massive financial driver for the @entity46 and you would think the @entity48 might have negotiated much harder on @entity1 's behalf			2
the @entity16 never come cheaply when they visit these shores and accept only the itinerary that suits them			0
and i do n't blame them			0
disappointment : @entity1 coach @entity55 during the 76 - 0 defeat by @entity14 in @entity57 was enough effort really made to get @entity4 to put the test schedule back by a week , which would have helped immensely ? were the @entity1 players consulted at all ? how much was @entity61 consulted ? if i was a first - choice player such as @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 - who will all miss out because of the @entity37 final - i would be livid at even being put in this position			1
you dedicate large chunks of your career to win selection			0
you overcome injuries to fight for the jersey , earning the right to play against @entity4 at @entity77			2
then , suddenly , your place is handed on a plate to somebody else			0
controversy : @entity1 's last two visits to @entity4 have been ruined by off - field incidents this tour is starting on the back foot and it will be great credit to @entity61 , his coaches , and especially the players , if they come back with more positives than negatives from the hardest school in world rugby			1
make no mistake , though , this tour is ideal for @entity1 as they prepare for @entity43 2015 ; they need to find out where they are as a team and make some informed judgments on their players			1
ideally , i would like to have seen an extra couple of fixtures , certainly another midweek game against the @entity17 , to get a large squad operating as one but it 's still an exciting itinerary			0
it is also massively important off the field because @entity1 's last two visits to @entity4 have been ruined by off - field incidents			1
end - of - season tours of @entity4 are just plain difficult but @entity1 must flip the psychology around			1
@entity109 rugby is in a good place , with a strong group of players on an upward curve and an excellent coaching team improving with every game			0
challenge : @entity9 has started on the back foot for @entity1 coach @entity22 @entity1 can still put out a very competitive side next saturday against a @entity4 team that will be short on preparation			1
@entity1 should all be highly motivated and , for many , it will still be the most important game of their careers so far			2
@entity22 must challenge those selected to produce the performance of their careers and come away with a win			1
@entity1 are n't meant to win in @entity4			1
it does n't happen very often , nobody will be expecting it			0
the @entity16 will be strong favourites but there is an opportunity to build a classic backs - to - the - wall mentality in @entity134 ahead of the first test			0
if @entity1 win it will automatically make them favourites for the @entity43 - and that is what they should be aspiring to be			1
recall : fly - half @entity24 last played for @entity1 in 2008 if @entity1 do win , it gets very interesting psychologically			2
only ' special ' teams beat the @entity16 in @entity4 so @entity22 would then have to decide whether to parachute in those five or six first - choice players who were unavailable			2
do you stick with the team that won or introduce players champing at the bit to get their shirts back ? that would be a great dilemma to face			0
i believe that could be the case but touring @entity4 is the hardest assignment bar none			0
to win , you need everyone 's noses pointing in the same direction and the @entity37 and the @entity48 have let down this group of players .			0

@entity1 coach @entity22 is having to leap through logistical hoops
@entity22 must challenge those selected to produce the performance of their careers
@entity4 tour is ideal for @entity1 as they prepare for 2015 @entity43
