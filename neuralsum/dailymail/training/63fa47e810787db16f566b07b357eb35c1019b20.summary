the @entity1 final that nobody predicted and not everyone wanted was seized on monday night with unblinking composure by @entity7 giant @entity5			1
the no 14 seed completed his third consecutive straight sets win to defeat a somewhat overwhelmed @entity11 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in less than two hours to deny @entity12 its equally unlikely @entity14 winner			1
an outstanding performance from @entity5 disappointed the millions who rose with the dawn there to watch their new national hero try and became the first @entity22 - born man to lift one of the sport 's biggest prizes			1
while most in the game believe @entity5 , who vehemently protested his innocence , to be an honest man guilty only of naivety the fact remains that his triumph is not an entirely good look for the sport			2
the one - sided nature of the contest between two relatively unheralded players was certainly a far cry from some of the beguiling thrillers involving the so - called @entity67 in recent times			2
it is not one that will linger long in the memory save , perhaps , for the fact that it is the last @entity73 final to be held on a monday before the reversion to sundays next year			0
@entity67 serve : @entity5 's booming serve provided the foundation for his convincing win power play : @entity11 reaches for a forehand in vain as he fell in straight sets to the big - hitting @entity7 frustration : @entity11 shouts during a tough match on @entity82 in @entity83 that should not detract from a brave and skilfull performance from the mild - mannered @entity7 , who rose to the occasion manfully and dictated the whole match with his serve and raking groundstrokes			1
afterwards @entity5 paid tribute to his coach , ex @entity92 champion @entity40 , saying , ' my team has brought me something , especially @entity40			1
the most important thing he brought to me was to make tennis enjoyable			0
' i have played the best of my life here			0
for all the other players who work hard it shows how it is going to pay off			0
i think the stars aligned			0
' a deflated @entity11 reflected : ' he was playing really well tonight and i could n't play my tennis			2
it is a tough loss			0
' @entity41 fans : cilic fans stand out in the red and white checks of @entity7 pumped : @entity5 reacts as his first @entity14 title approached helpless : @entity11 had no answers for @entity5 's relentless strength when @entity11 , giving away eight inches in height , threatened to revive with three break points at 2 - 4 in the third set @entity5 held firm and , as in the whole match , his vastly improved serve was there to get him out of trouble			1
he closed it out with a cross court backhand winner and fell on his back , @entity124 - style , in his unbridled delight before scaling the stands to celebrate with his supporters			0
at the slightly surreal start time of 5pm nobody could be sure how either player would be able to react			0
it was the first @entity1 final since 1997 , when @entity132 lost to @entity133 , to feature two players making their debut in the climax to a @entity14			1
the victory is not especially good news for @entity139 , who finds himself outside the world 's top ten for the first time in six years at number eleven , and facing a real challenge to qualify for the @entity145 at the @entity146			0
in his corner : @entity148 has worked wonders with @entity11 since taking over as coach supporters : fans in @entity11 's home town of @entity154 in western @entity12 watch the match on a big screen emotional : a woman in @entity154 reacts as @entity11 is blown away by his bigger opponent @entity5 's game is impressively functional rather than anything of great beauty , but one outstanding feature is his easy movement for such a tall man , which would grace any @entity167 basketball team			1
a @entity11 strength is his explosive footspeed , but he looked somewhat sluggish from the off , a product of nerves and perhaps his tougher run to the final			1
there was no great surprise when he was broken for 2 - 4 , as the towering @entity7 was all over his second serve and profiting from a surfeit of unforced errors			1
he made the breakthrough when a particularly inauspicious sliced forehand that floated wide			0
@entity5 was making a lot of headway by driving hard and wide to his opponent 's backhand and he went ahead in the second set when another one of those went bulging into the net			2
the @entity7 , saved two break points immediately afterwards , the second one with an ace delivered by a serve that has been part of his considerable improvement			0
he blinked when serving for the set at 5 - 2 but the @entity12 was somewhat reminiscent of @entity139 inhis first @entity1 final six years ago – looking tired and overwhelmed – and he dropped serve again to fall two behind			1
one player never got going while the other was on it from the start – the uneven scale of the contest the final tale of the @entity202 from the 2014 @entity1			2
action hero : @entity204 enjoys the match in @entity83 with his wife @entity206 out and about : @entity207 was also at @entity208 with his wife @entity209			0
