by @entity0 for @entity1 a team of @entity4 scientists has discovered tunnels that are almost as tall as the @entity6 under an ice shelf in @entity8			1
researchers from a number of @entity4 universities and the @entity12 - a research centre based on the continent - detected the tunnels when they flew a plane over the @entity18 in @entity8			1
radar from the plane , as well as satellite photos , revealed that ridges and cavities on the surface of the ice sheet corresponded to tunnels lying at its base			1
@entity4 scientists discovered the tunnel using radar from the specially - modified plane			1
it revealed that ridges and cavities on the surface of the ice corresponded to 820 - foot - high tunnels hidden at the base of the sheet the 820 - foot tunnels are nearly as tall as the @entity6 - which measures just over 987 feet - and more than four times as tall as @entity41 - which comes in at 213 feet			1
researchers concluded that the placement of the tunnels means that they were most likely formed from meltwater - water released from melting ice - that flowing underneath the ice sheet , over land , and into the ocean			0
the data revealed that water moved beneath the ice in concentrated channels , similar to rivers			0
scientists previously thought that meltwater flowed underneath ice sheets in more evenly - spread , thin , continuous sheets			2
researchers used a specially - modified @entity61 aircraft to make the discovery			0
the plane , designed to operate in remote environment , was fitted with remote sensors that provided scientists with data on the land , ice and sea that it flew over			0
scientists from the @entity72 and researchers from a number of @entity4 universities made the discovery at the @entity18 in @entity8			0
pictured : a @entity12 base a @entity79 aircraft , similar to the one pictured , was equipped with special radar equipment that provided scientists with data on the land , ice and sea that it flew over the data revealed that water moved beneath the ice in concentrated channels , similar to rivers			1
scientists had previously thought that meltwater moved in more evenly spread sheets of water specially - designed radar equipment deciphered the tunnels under the ice - it can also be used to pick out layers within the ice itself			2
longer - term monitoring from the air can be used to record the break - up of ice sheets or atmospheric changes			0
the @entity4 team will now use its newfound knowledge of the under - ice tunnels to predict how exactly that ice shelf will melt in response to climate change			2
the researchers published a paper about their work in the journal @entity110 .			0

@entity4 scientists discovered the 820 - foot tunnels in @entity8
they were detected on *airborne* radar imaging and satellite photos
*suggest* that water flows in concentrated ' rivers ' beneath ice sheets
the information will be used to predict how the ice will melt
