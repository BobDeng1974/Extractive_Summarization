a woman has lost nearly 8st after motivating herself to stick to a diet by taking selfies and posting them online			1
@entity3 , 35 , from @entity4 , @entity5 , weighed 19st 2lb in january last year when she finally tackled her weight gain after the birth of her two children			1
the mother - of - two felt so bad about how she looked in the images that they spurred her to carry on eating healthily and keep documenting the results			1
she said : ' i posted the first one almost as a joke			1
i felt really bad about myself and looked bad and i felt if i could start to see the change it might help me to carry on			0
' but in fact i was also so embarrassed about the images that it was something that made me determined to carry on			0
' her diet before consisted mainly of takeaways , fast food , ready meals , lots of cheese and sandwiches laden with fatty fillings			1
she also snacked on chocolate , biscuits , crisps and high calorie snacks			0
determined to shed the pounds she revamped her her diet , eating healthy homemade meals such as soups , lots of fruit , vegetable , lean meats and salads			2
she also cut out certain food categories including wheat , sugar and starch			0
@entity3 says her friends soon noticed the change in her appearance , with every successive selfie the first posting that she had posted online had included the message : ' just a joke , selfie no. 1			1
' ' i 've always had trouble controlling my diet and have been immensely overweight since i was 18 years old , ' she said although many of the selfies are just of her face , the difference in her size as she loses weight is obvious the first snap she posted online included the message : ' just a joke , selfie no.1			1
' on the worst days when she felt desperate for chocolate , she only needed to scroll back over the previous selfies to remind herself what it was all about , and get the energy to carry on			1
she said : ' my friends were the ones who pointed out the difference between then and now pictures , and that kept me on the diet			2
' @entity3 says a major reason she wanted to lose weight was to have energy for her children @entity90 , left , and @entity3 when temped to reach for chocolate she scrolled back through the pictures to see how far she had come by the end of the year she had managed to shed 7st 12lb			1
in fact i felt fantastic after the first few days and that feeling just continued , ' she said			0
the first picture she posted online had included the message : ' just a joke , selfie no.1			2
' but despite its jokey nature , the snap did encourage her when she realised she did not want to look like that any more			0
' after i had my children almost seven years ago , i completely lost control of everything and put on quite a lot of weight			2
' if she was tempted by chocolate , @entity3 scrolled back through her pictures as reminder of how far she 'd come an added factor was the fact that she did not have the energy for her children , @entity3 and @entity90 , any more			1
she would prioritise easy access to food over being active and physical with them on the weekends			0
' it was like i did n't do anything unless i got to eat at the same time , ' she admitted			2
@entity3 measured her year - long slimdown which she documented with her ' embarrassing ' selfies as the weight dropped off , @entity3 's brother was even able to pick her up for the first time since she was 18 ' for me , food was a drug			1
i never ate just one little chocolate piece , it was always something more			0
' the first two or three days of the diet were a bit difficult , but since then i 've been so stable , floating around on a pink cloud			2
' i was more energetic and could easily get up in the morning			0
the mental recovery was so much that i thought i had already lost 60 kilos ( 9st ) in february , even though it was still a long way to go			0
' i felt better as all kinds of physical pain disappeared			0
' she added that she is no longer anxious about going abroad , when she was always wondering if she would fit into the airplane seat or if she 'd need a seatbelt extension			0
' i still find it painful to look at the first few selfies from last year , but i always feel better looking at the end of the year			0
' @entity3 's diet involved cutting out certain food groups like wheat , and she posted snaps of her meals online			1

at 19st 2lb , mother - of - two from @entity5 had no energy for her children
@entity3 , 35 , posted selfies to spur her to eat healthily
if tempted to cheat on her diet , she 'd look back at photos of her *progress*
managed to lose nearly 8st and now weighs a slim 11st 4lb
