@entity1 boss @entity0 is busy looking for a new goalkeeper but has played down talk linking him with @entity5 's @entity4 - and emphasised that neither @entity6 nor @entity7 are about to leave @entity8			1
@entity0 has wanted to bring in a shot - stopper since first - choice @entity10 picked up a calf injury on @entity12 that is set to rule him out until well into february			1
reports have suggested the manager is interested in @entity4 , but when asked on monday if there was anything in the stories about the @entity18 international - who missed @entity5 's match at the weekend due to an injury of his own - potentially joining @entity1 , @entity0 said : ' no - nothing at all			1
' @entity5 goalkeeper @entity4 has been linked with a move to @entity0 's @entity1 despite the reports , @entity0 has claimed that @entity4 ( pictured ) is not on @entity1 's radar the @entity25 did , however , confirm he had made some enquiries about goalkeepers this month , adding : ' it is something we have done for a while now , but nothing has been conclusive or done in a way that we can announce any names			1
' i 'm not interested in bringing in a short - term goalkeeper - we 'll look at the options , but if we bring in anyone , it has to be someone who can stay with us for the long term			0
' we are going to explore that avenue and if we find the right personality , we 'll act on it			0
' with regard to potential outgoings from @entity1 in the current transfer window , there has been speculation that striker @entity6 could move to @entity49 side @entity48 and full - back @entity7 make a switch to @entity51			1
speaking at his press conference to preview tuesday 's @entity53 third - round replay at @entity55 , @entity0 also dismissed those suggestions , insisting there would be no ' big sales ' made by the @entity59 this month			1
@entity0 has said that there is ' nothing at all ' in the @entity4 rumours , while stating that @entity7 and @entity6 will both stay at the club beyond the january transfer window @entity7 ( right ) has been linked with a move to @entity51 , but @entity0 says there will be no big exits on @entity6 , @entity0 said : ' i know there has been a lot of speculation , but we have n't been contacted - we have had no conversations about that issue at all			1
' at the moment @entity6 is working really well and is always a really strong influence in the day - to - day work , and there is nothing to comment on really			2
' and when asked about there being any truth in the @entity7 reports , @entity0 said : ' no. ' i have said before that we are in a position where all that matters is to get good momentum in the league and be as strong as we can in the cups			2
' we are not entertaining that speculation of big sales			0
we are not going to sell our big assets in the window , so i think all those stories and admiration from the outside are just a waste of time			0
' @entity1 have struggled for ' good momentum ' in recent weeks - indeed , prior to the original cup tie against @entity55 last tuesday they had lost four games in a row and won only one in nine in all competitions			0
it has been reported that @entity6 ( left ) could be set for a move to serie a side @entity48 in january @entity0 has played down reports of @entity7 ( left ) moving to @entity107 's @entity51 the rot has been stopped with 1 - 1 draws in that match and then against @entity110 in the @entity111 on saturday ; performances @entity0 believes have provided a platform from which his side can now build for a decent second half of the season			1
although he accepts questions have been asked of his players , the 41 - year - old has stressed he has never doubted them himself			0
and that includes striker @entity121 , the Â£ 28million club record summer signing who has bounced back from starting two successive games on the bench to put in eye - catching displays as part of the first xi against the @entity55 and @entity110			0
@entity121 's last - gasp equaliser against the @entity131 outfit last week means he has scored a goal in each of his last four encounters with @entity55			0
there were doubts over @entity121 , but he proved his worth with two eye - catching displays for @entity1 @entity121 scored a last - gasp equaliser against @entity55 to nick a draw for @entity1 in the @entity53 last tuesday @entity0 will be hoping for more of the same on tuesday , and said of the @entity142 international : ' @entity121 is now performing at a very good level , but he has always showed real desire to help the team and strong responsibility			1
' i have always known that @entity121 , fully fit , is in my eyes one of the best strikers in world football			0
' now he is in the right place and it has been very pleasing to see him enjoying his football and being so effective in the last two games			0
' @entity1 will on tuesday be without the same seven players who missed the @entity110 contest - @entity10 , @entity157 ( groin ) , @entity159 ( unspecified ) , @entity160 ( foot ) , @entity162 , @entity163 ( both knee ) and @entity165 ( hamstring )			2
@entity0 has confirmed he intends to include 22 - year - old forward @entity167 in the squad to face @entity55 .			2
