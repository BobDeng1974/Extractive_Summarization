@entity0 has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the @entity11 star			1
ms @entity0 , a 44 - year - old from @entity13 , told people : ' it 's come to my understanding that there 's greater credibility for my testimony with a full name and an image			1
' i am so very grateful for the @entity5 who came before me in the lawsuit 10 years ago ... my mother and i were very eager to give our support via testimony at that time â€“ however , not to the general public			0
i was not quite strong enough then			0
' in 1988 , the then 17 - year - old aspiring model met @entity4 via her modelling agency in @entity32			1
he assured the teen and her parents that he would help her become a star			2
ms @entity0 told @entity14 that @entity4 made uncomfortable advances against her which ended in her feeling pressured to perform a sexual act on him			1
' i 'm like a robot , and that is what i became , and that is what i did for him , ' she said			0
she was reportedly given $ 700 as she left his home			0
she told people that she had decided to come forward now because she ' would rather go to bed at night knowing that i 've been honest '			1
she also felt that remaining as ' @entity5 ' made her allegations less credible			0
ultimately , ms @entity0 hoped that @entity4 will come clean about the mounting allegations against him			1
@entity54 was awaiting a comment from @entity4 's attorney , @entity56 , on thursday			2
when ms @entity0 's story was originally revealed in november 2014 , @entity56 called it ' absurd ' to publish an ' unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person '			1
miss @entity64 eventually settled out of court			0
last friday , @entity4 's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 - accusing the beleaguered comedian of decades - old sexual offenses			1
the accusers , all of whom have stepped forward in recent years , said @entity4 's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence			1
but @entity4 's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self - defense as his character was under attack			2
' the law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked , ' the lawyers argued in their 38 - page filing			0
' instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims			0
' @entity93 , a lawyer for the three accusers , said his clients disagree with that position			0
' we believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual , it must be truthful , ' he said			0
' we look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful			0
' @entity4 's legal team has said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct			1
the former star of @entity11 has n't been charged with any crime			1
more than a dozen women have stepped forward in recent years to level various assault accusations			1
@entity70 , a 56 - year - old @entity116 lawyer , says @entity4 drugged and sexually assaulted her in her @entity118 - area apartment in the early 1970s			2
@entity71 says @entity4 drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in @entity121 around 1976			2
and @entity72 alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a @entity116 beach in about 1970			0
@entity70 , a @entity116 lawyer , ( left ) filed a defamation lawsuit against @entity4 in december 2014 claiming that he and his attorneys said she had lied about a sexual assault from 40 years ago ( she is pictured , right , at the time ) @entity128 was joined in the lawsuit by @entity72 ( left ) , who alleged that @entity4 tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970 , and nurse @entity71 ( right ) , 57 , who said the comic raped her in 1976 when she was 19 years old @entity4 's lawyers said his representatives were responding to the accusations in strongly - worded rebukes			1
one november 2014 statement references @entity138 's ' extensive ' criminal record , which includes larceny , fraud and drug possession charges			0
' as the old saying goes , " consider the source , " ' wrote @entity4 attorney @entity142 , who also attached copies of @entity138 's @entity13 criminal and prison records with the statement			1
another november 2014 statement cited by @entity4 's accusers offers ' general comments ' on the allegations and does not specifically name any of the accusers , his lawyers say			2
' the new , never - before - heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated , fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30 , 40 , or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity , ' @entity56 wrote at the time			1
' it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity4 to stop			2
' the three women seek an unspecified amount of money for compensatory and punitive damages			0
many of the accusations against him exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution			0
but the scandal has taken its toll on the 77 - year - old actor and comedian as he has sought to revive his career with a national stand - up comedy tour			0
@entity4 has canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances as more accusers have come forward , and women 's groups have protested or threatened to rally at many of his public appearances			1
lawyers for the three accusers have until march 20 to file a reply to @entity4 's motion to dismiss the suit			2
@entity128 originally filed the defamation lawsuit in december 2014 and @entity71 and @entity72 joined later			0
the suit is filed in @entity192 in @entity193 , in western @entity194			0
@entity4 has a home nearby in @entity196 .			2

@entity0 has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the @entity11 star
ms @entity0 , 44 , from @entity13 , finally found the courage to come forward ' because she wanted to go to bed at night knowing she *'d* been honest '
