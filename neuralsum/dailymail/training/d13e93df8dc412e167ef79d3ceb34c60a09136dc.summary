since @entity41 's syndrome did n't become a standard diagnosis until the early 1990s , many of @entity2 's software testers were adults when they first learned they were on the autism spectrum			1

@entity5 , 35 , was diagnosed in her late 20s with @entity41 's			1
as a child , she 'd been labeled as mentally ill. ' @entity41 is not a mental illness , ' she said			2

' ' when you 're a child , the school is very concerned with you , the state is very concerned with you , ' @entity18 said			0

@entity2 ' is a magnificent and innovative venture , ' she said			2
@entity2 pays $ 12 to $ 15 an hour and bosses never yell if you 're late and nobody minds if you need to be alone for a while many businesses hire offshore companies to test software			2
