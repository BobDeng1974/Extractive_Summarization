by @entity0 published : 16:27 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 17:30 est , 7 february 2013 magnetism : scientists have found evidence suggesting salmon use the @entity6 's magnetic field to guide them back to their spawning grounds ever wondered how salmon navigate across thousands of miles of ocean without getting lost ? after years feeding at sea , the fish swim through vast expanses of featureless water back to the rivers where they hatched			1
now scientists may have finally answered a mystery that has baffled them for decades , after finding evidence suggesting salmon use the @entity6 ’s magnetic field to guide them back to their spawning grounds			1
researchers believe that when the fish first enter the sea , they memorise the location ’s magnetic field and use it as a home address			1
the magnetic field varies across the globe , allowing animals to use it as a ‘ map ’ and determine their location			1
‘ to find their way back home across thousands of kilometres of ocean , salmon imprint on the magnetic field that exists where they first enter the sea as juveniles , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity33 of @entity34			2
‘ upon reaching maturity , they seek the coastal location with the same magnetic field			2
’ to test the theory , they looked at fisheries data going back 56 years , documenting the return of sockeye salmon to the @entity54 in @entity55			2
but to reach the river mouth , the fish must either swim around the north or south side of @entity60			0
scientists , who published their findings in the journal @entity64 , discovered their decision was influenced by the @entity6 ’s magnetic field , which shifts slightly each year			1
the fish showed greater preference for the inlet that most matched the magnetic value of the @entity54 when they left it two years earlier			2
if it was closer north of the island , then the fish were more likely to opt for that route , while if it was south there was an increased chance they would migrate using that course			0
‘ when they attempt to return , they are confronted with a giant obstacle : @entity60 is blocking direct access to their river , ’ said dr @entity33			0
‘ so the fish must make a choice : do they use the northern inlet or the southern inlet in their detour ? ' he added : ‘ @entity94 have to get it right because they only have one chance to make it back to their home river , so it makes sense that they may have more than one way to get there			0
the research looked at fisheries data going back 56 years , documenting the return of sockeye salmon ( pictured ) to the @entity54 in @entity55 scientists found the fish showed greater preference for the inlet that most matched the magnetic value of the @entity54 ( pictured ) when they left it two years earlier ‘ the magnetic field is amazingly consistent , so that is a strategy that can withstand the test of time			1
but they may also use the sun as a compass , track waves breaking on the beach through infrasound , and use smell			0
’ other animals believed to use @entity6 ’s magnetic field to navigate include birds , turtles , and termites			1
and if you are ever lost in the countryside without a compass , do n’t panic			0
just look for a herd of cows and see which way they are pointing			0
lead researcher dr @entity33 said : ' @entity94 have to get it right because they only have one chance to make it back to their home river ' after monitoring the behaviour of thousands of cattle , scientists have found that they tend to face north , after using the magnetic field to align themselves			1
the behaviour is thought to be a relic of the days when the wild ancestors of today ’s domesticated cattle used inbuilt compasses to find their way across the plains of @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 on long migrations			2
animals are thought to use internal magnets - made of crystals of magnetite - to find their way around			0
homing pigeons , for instance , have a tiny blob of these crystals in their beaks .			0
