most people were shocked while reading @entity2 ' raunchy mummy porn trilogy @entity3 at the idea that a man might have a contractual sexual relationship with a woman			1
but now one real - life @entity3 has come forward to explain why he ritualistically enters into precisely this sort of ' arrangement '			1
@entity11 , a 30 - year - old businessman from @entity12 in east @entity13 , boasts a six - figure salary and a penchant for providing the women he dates with the finest things in life ... in return for sex			1
@entity11 , who runs a @entity22 company , has been finding female students on a ' sugar daddy ' dating website since he was 28 , with whom he enters into ' mutually beneficial arrangements ' @entity11 sees similarities between himself and @entity3 , the protagonist of the @entity29 which details the s&m relationship between @entity3 and student @entity3			1
he admits he enjoys the comparisons with @entity3 - also a successful businessman who insists upon having contracts with the women he dates - saying : ' half the women in the world are infatuated with @entity3			1
' yes , he has his dark side , but what single guy in his thirties would n't want beautiful young students throwing themselves at him ? ' @entity11 , who runs a @entity22 company , has been finding female students on a ' sugar daddy ' dating website since he was 28 , with whom he enters into ' mutually beneficial arrangements '			1
these are contracts between him and the girls where , according to a spokesman for the site , ' they give him sex and show him a good time , and he lavishes them with riches '			2
one of the first students @entity11 dated on the site was @entity56 , a 21 - year - old studying languages at @entity58			1
he said : ' we hit it off straight away by email and quickly arranged to meet at a pub in @entity63 near @entity64			2
the average @entity66 sugar daddy earns £ 170,000 a year and spends £ 1,500 a month on girls he meets ' she was blonde , tall , sophisticated and very well - read and travelled - she was everything i look for in a woman			1
we entered into a mutually beneficial arrangement			2
' i was paying her around £ 1,000 a month - sometimes more depending on how often we 'd see each other			0
' we 'd go away for weekends - @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			0
we 'd stay somewhere nice , have great sex and just enjoy each other 's company			0
at some point we 'd always go shopping and i 'd treat her - shoes , dresses , you name it			0
' the sex was fantastic			0
the @entity3 books are pretty dark			1
we 'd indulge in a bit of role play but nothing as sinister as @entity93 and @entity94 - we 'd just have fun			0
' @entity11 said said the arrangement worked for both of them : ' @entity56 got help with her student fees and i 'd got a beautiful young girlfriend			1
' i treated her in just the same way as i would if we had met in the bar - but this way you can establish that arrangement a little quicker than you would ordinarily			2
you are both aware of what is expected of you right from the beginning			0
' neither of us wanted anything heavy - and we parted amicably after a couple of months			0
' by then @entity11 had met @entity113 , a 22 - year - old studying fashion in @entity13			1
he said : ' she had very expensive tastes so we went shopping a lot			0
' she had joined the site because she wanted to live the life of a celebrity but on student money			0
she was very sexy and loved to be dominated			0
' @entity11 , a 30 - year - old businessman from @entity12 in east @entity13 , boasts a six - figure salary and a penchant for providing the women he dates with the finest things in life ... in return for sex @entity11 also dated a recent graduate from @entity129 he met on the site , seeking arrangement			1
@entity132 , 24 , had student debts of £ 62,000 and was living in @entity13 trying to get a job in television			2
@entity136 said : ' there was no way she could have survived financially without the help of a sugar daddy			1
' i really felt sorry for her - she was worried sick about her debt			0
' i really do n't know how some students cope without having very rich parents			2
' i admired @entity132 because she was determined to make it in tv and was basically working as in intern for no money			0
' she had dated several sugar daddies before me			2
' she was totally unapologetic about it and admitted that once she had got her career and her finances sorted she would quit the site			0
' writer @entity2 with her novel , @entity3 , which @entity11 says bears uncanny resemblances with his own life			1

@entity11 , 30 , from east @entity13 , is ' sugar daddy ' to students met *online*
