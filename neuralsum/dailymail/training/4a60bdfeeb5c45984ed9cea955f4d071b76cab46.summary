a bear ' rehabilitator ' who helps abandoned bears cubs has found himself parenting 27 lively orphans after the extremely harsh winter killed their parents @entity8 normally looks after between three and five cubs a year at an enclosure near his @entity12 home until they are old enough to care for themselves			1
but the extremely harsh winter has proved tough for the black bears with many young cubs being left orphans			1
it was every week or twice a week we were getting calls , " we 've got a group of cubs , " then " another group of cubs "			2
' mr @entity21 keeps the cubs in an eight acre - the equivalent of 3.2 hectares - enclosed forest behind his house until spring , when he works with the state @entity39 to release them in remote locations			1
and he 's certainly got his hands full this year , as while these bears normally hibernate for the winter , this year 's bumper bunch have decided not to			1
' they 've managed to keep themselves awake , ' he said			0
' there 's always somebody who stirs up somebody else , and pretty soon , everybody 's up			0
' playtime : twelve black bear cubs can be seen playing together in the trees in the enclosed forest behind mr @entity21 's house for a while , @entity8 tried withholding food in hopes that the bears would sleep , but that did n't work			1
' they just roto - tilled the pen , ' he said			2
' it was obvious that they were seeking food , so we just gave up and started going back once a day feeding them			2
' staying awake all winter wo n't hurt the bears , he said , and if anything , they are better off having spent the winter in a large group			1
with just a few cubs , it was common for one to pace back and forth near the fence , @entity21 said			1
but none of the current cubs is showing that kind of anxiety			2
' they 're just one big happy family , they roam around , play with each other , ' he said			0
' they are very , very happy as a big social unit			0
' full - time job : @entity21 's sister @entity90 helps her brother to keep track of all the orphans - which include four sets of triplets @entity97 , the bear project leader for the @entity99 , said officials were expecting more orphaned cubs than usual but were surprised at just how many turned up			1
' it was like nothing we 've ever seen			0
a high year in the past was maybe , seven or eight bears , ' he said			1
' it was a very challenging year , for sure , and we 're not done yet			2
i 'm absolutely positive there will be more showing up this spring as a result of these conditions last year			2
' the bumper crop of cubs can be traced to a two - year swing in the bears ' food supply			1
younger female bears often do n't give birth during leaner years , but with an abundance of beechnuts , berries and other food in 2011 , there was a baby boom			1
more black bear cubs were orphaned this year after a good breeding season was followed by a difficult winter in 2012 , however , dry conditions meant food was scarce , and bears were forced to venture into backyards for food			1
sows that foraged for food in chicken coops and beehives ended up getting shot by property owners , leaving the cubs behind			2
' the big wave of them came in june and july as a direct result of females getting shot in chicken pens , ' @entity97 said			0
' it was just bang , bang , bang , with calls coming in from people saying , " i just shot a bear , come and pick it up "			0
' the state has a program to help landowners install electric fencing to protect their coops , he said , but many are unwilling to use it			0
and the law is on the side of property owners			0
in demand : @entity21 is the only licensed ' bear rehabilitator ' in @entity12 ' we bend over backwards to help people with that problem , and we 'd like to see a little more tolerance out there among the public towards wildlife that might be attracted to the chicken pen , ' he said			1
' it 's an easy fix			0
' once the bear 's in your chicken coop , the damage is done so there 's nothing gained by shooting the bear , ' he said			0
@entity21 , who has been studying bears for more than 20 years , has produced and appeared in numerous documentaries and written two books about bear social behavior			1
the second , titled ' @entity184 , ' is due out this summer , and he 's also working on a doctoral degree in environmental conservation that builds on his work in @entity188 helping wildlife experts who are reintroducing pandas to the wild			0
back in @entity194 , much of the day - to - day care of bears falls to @entity21 's sister , @entity90 , who said despite the added workload this year - which includes four sets of triplets - it 's not hard for her to keep track of so many bears			1
some of them are named for the towns where they were found - there 's ' @entity206 ' and ' @entity207 ' - while others have more whimsical such monikers as @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			2
@entity210 is the group lookout and runs up to be fed first , she said			0
others hang back and do n't eat until the @entity216 leave			0
and thanks to an outpouring of donations after a local television publicized the situation , they have plenty of dog food to keep everyone well - fed until spring			2
' you get to recognize them by behavior as well as by sight , ' she said			0
' we do pretty well			0
some of those last triplets were hard to tell apart , but otherwise we do pretty well			0
' growing up : mr @entity21 takes care of the orphaned black bear cubs over winter until they are big enough to care for themselves and be released into the wild			1

@entity21 has an eight - acre enclosure for the bears in @entity12
he normally takes in between three and five orphaned cubs a year
but a *freezing* winter and lack of food has killed more adult black bears
so far , 27 orphaned black bear cubs have been found in @entity12
