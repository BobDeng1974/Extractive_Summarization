the @entity1 @entity6 today reported about 31 smaller agencies will go , 11 will be merged and nine bigger departments will fold completely			2
' a more prosperous @entity1 ' treasurer @entity9 has declared tuesday 's budget will benefit all @entity1 in the long run , despite short - term pain five departments , including the @entity4 , will be sold - off			1
the initial forecasted job cuts of 12,000 has since been revised and it looks as if that number will be closer to 16,000			1
treasurer @entity9 has assured @entity1 it is all part of a cost - savings measure to help get the budget back into the black by 2024			1
mr @entity9 said : ' it is a budget that asks the @entity1 people to contribute to a stronger @entity1 economy , a more prosperous @entity1 with more jobs and a greater sense of security , ' savings of more than $ 470 million will be made by the winding back , sale and scrapping of jobs and government agencies			1
the @entity4 ( pictured ) will be sold , as will a number of key government agencies in a bid to get @entity1 's budget back in to surplus by 2024 if it goes through , the sale of the @entity38 would raise $ 1 billion and other assets , including the mint , would provide millions more			1

this is despite the majority of workers being employed in only about 100 of government agencies			0
treasurer @entity9 has therefore made a commitment to winding back the public service and putting the government 's efforts into improving its most important sectors			1
' you can have lots of small programs that involve a massive amount of red tape with very little outcome , ' mr @entity9 said			2

' @entity1 unions have gone on the front foot in support of public sector workers			1

@entity106 national secretary @entity105 said the survey shows the damage being done to public services and highlights the risks if the government continues to pursue cuts			0
' the very clear message we are getting from workers at the coalface is that ongoing cuts are putting the public service under unsustainable pressure , ' she said			0
' the government can pretend it can make cuts without hurting services , but this survey shows that is simply not true			0
' @entity127 president @entity126 said : ' it ’s not in @entity1 ’s interest to implement savage cuts to health , education , pensions , welfare and public sector jobs , while at the same time dropping the baton on training , investment and vital job creation			1
