prostate cancer drugs taken by thousands of men have been linked to fatal heart attacks in a study			1
@entity5 academics found the treatment trebled the likelihood of death among men with existing heart problems			2
however , cancer experts pointed out that the benefits of the life - extending treatment normally outweigh any possible risks			0
some 41,700 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in @entity18 each year , with most cases in patients over the age of 50			1
@entity5 academics found the treatment trebled the likelihood of death among men with existing heart problems this is an age when they are also at increased risk of heart disease			2
it is estimated that more than 16,000 men in this country receive hormone treatment called androgen deprivation therapy ( @entity34 ) , which was the focus of the @entity36 study			2
researchers looked at 5,077 men with prostate cancer who were treated from 1997 to 2006 , and particularly the risks of @entity34 drugs , which work by reducing the levels of certain hormones that fuel tumour growth			1
they found that in healthy men , or those with raised blood pressure or cholesterol , there was no link to deaths from heart attacks			0
but in men who had already suffered a heart attack or heart failure , which would weaken the heart muscle , the risk was three times higher			0
the researchers theorised that changes in hormone levels could also affect the heart			1
they concluded that the treatment should be avoided in patients with existing heart problems who have tumours which are slow growing and lower risk			0
in men who had already suffered a heart attack or heart failure , which would weaken the heart muscle , the risk was three times higher ( file photo ) lead researcher dr @entity82 , whose study is published in the journal @entity85 , said : ‘ while androgen deprivation therapy can be a life - saving drug for men with prostate cancer and significantly increase the cure rates when used with radiation for aggressive disease , this study also raises the possibility that a small sub-group of men who have significant heart disease could experience increased cardiac death			1
men who sleep with more than one woman in their lifetime are less likely to develop prostate cancer , research shows			1
those who had 20 or more female sexual partners over their lives reduced their risk by 28 per cent compared to those with one			0
and virgins were twice as likely to be diagnosed than sexually experienced men			0
the study involved 3,208 men who had answered questions about their lifestyle and sex lives			0
the @entity110 researchers said that a higher frequency of sexual encounters could help prevent the cancer			0
lead researcher professor @entity114 , from the @entity115 , explained : ‘ it is possible that having many female sexual partners results in a higher frequency of ejaculations , whose protective effect against prostate cancer has been previously observed in cohort studies			1
we now know that the number and type of partners must be taken into account to better understand the causes of prostate cancer			1
’ other experts have speculated that having lots of sex could reduce the concentration of cancer - causing substances in the semen			0
despite the findings , published in the journal @entity141 , professor parent cautioned against men using the findings to be promiscuous			0
‘ i would still say that for men with significant heart problems , we should try to avoid @entity34 when it is not necessary – such as for men with low - risk disease or men receiving @entity34 only to shrink the prostate prior to radiation			2
however , for men with high - risk disease , in whom the prostate cancer benefits of @entity34 likely outweigh any potential cardiac harms , @entity34 should be given even if they have heart problems , but the patient should be followed closely by a cardiologist to ensure that he is being carefully watched and optimised from a cardiac perspective			1
’ it is estimated that more than 16,000 men in this country receive hormone treatment called androgen deprivation therapy , which was the focus of the @entity36 study ( picture posed by model ) dr @entity168 , director of research at @entity170 , said : ‘ it is well known that men over 50 are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer			1
if also overweight , this same group are also at increased risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes			0
‘ we therefore welcome research which looks at taking these other diseases into account when considering prostate cancer treatments			1
‘ however , although this study suggests a potential link between @entity34 hormone therapy and increased risk of death in men with an existing heart problem , it does show that the risks are in fact relatively small and that the benefits of taking this for treatment outweigh any possible harmful effects			2
‘ we would not therefore wish to see men currently on this form of therapy stop their treatment as a result of these findings			0
