when a photo emerged of @entity2 with his arm around the shoulders of a ‘ pick - up artist ’ banned from @entity6 , the comedian swiftly distanced himself from his vile techniques			1
but while @entity2 declared himself ‘ wholeheartedly against ’ @entity9 ’s methods , he appeared to be on shaky ground yesterday when his links to another self - styled seduction guru came back to haunt him			1
@entity9 , 25 , who runs a company claiming to teach men how to make women ‘ beg ’ for sex , had been due to conduct a seminar in @entity6 this week until more than 136,000 people successfully petitioned for him to be refused a visa			1
however , questions have been raised about his stance after it emerged that he provided a cover quote for a seduction manual called @entity33 by @entity34			1
in it , the @entity36 author advises desperate bachelors to use techniques such as ‘ negging ’ , in which a man tries to subtly insult a woman and undermine her self - confidence in the hope she will become desperate for his approval			2
emblazoned on the cover of the 2007 book is a quote from @entity2 saying : ‘ @entity34 ’s writing turned me from a desperate wallflower into a wallflower who can talk women into sex			1
’ he also discussed pornography and ‘ notches on the bedpost ’ when he interviewed @entity34 several years ago on a @entity58 , at one point saying : ‘ okay @entity34 , teach us more			0
’ @entity34 , 45 , who calls @entity2 a friend , has said the comedian ‘ does extremely well as a pick - up artist … when i met him he was intuitively using the principles in the book			1
’ endorsement : brandprovided a cover quote for a seduction manual by @entity34 ( pictured ) @entity34 ’s devotees include @entity36 - based @entity9 , who said his interest in picking up women started when he read one of his books			1
critics say his methods , such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends , are abusive and controlling			2
footage has also emerged of @entity9 using racist language and grabbing women by the throat			1
one @entity82 post says : ‘ dear girls , could you please save me the effort and roofie [ spike ] your own drink ? # @entity89			0
’ after he was banned from @entity6 , @entity91 mp @entity90 said : ‘ @entity9 ’s presence in the @entity6 could have led to an increase in sexual violence and harassment			1
’ when a picture emerged online of @entity2 and @entity98 together , the comedian claimed he had not known who he was posing with			1
he said : ‘ i never knew who that was			0
so many people come up to me all the time			0
‘ i ’m against treating women in a disrespectful way			0
that whole pick - up thing … seemed appealing to me when i was a kid			2
any system for chatting up women is in itself questionable			0
‘ but any that ’s sort of based on objectifying or undermining women i would never , never , never , never , never endorse			0
‘ so just to be clear , if you ’ve got any questions about my attitude towards @entity9 or anyone that treats women or anybody disrespectfully , i ’m 100 per cent , wholeheartedly against it			2
’ @entity9 was also kicked out of @entity117 earlier this month when his visa was cancelled after protests about his techniques			2
he had been due to hold seminars there until december			0
as the furore intensified last week , he finally apologised for his behaviour and insisted his ‘ intentions were never bad ’			0
‘ i ’d like to apologise to anyone i ’ve offended in any way , ’ he said			0
‘ it was never my intention … i ’m extremely sorry for everything that happened			0
’ outrage : critics of @entity9 , pictured , say his methods , such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends , are abusive and controlling			2
