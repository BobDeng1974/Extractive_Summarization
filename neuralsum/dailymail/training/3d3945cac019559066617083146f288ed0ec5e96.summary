@entity31 is a big admirer of the 27 - year - old and @entity18 is also interested but whether either will pay £ 150,000 - per - week for his services could be another matter entirely			0
he might have to drop his price too			0
on the move : @entity21 has not signed a new deal at @entity1 and is set to leave @entity40 winner : the @entity41 has been linked with a move to @entity24 and @entity25 video wenger with unfinished transfer business @entity45 / @entity46 wanted by : @entity45 : @entity47 / @entity46 : @entity24 , @entity48 @entity26 : £ 12/15million when @entity50 signs ( most probably next week ) @entity1 will have three top goalkeepers and even @entity52 ca n’t come up with a plan that keeps all of them happy			1
@entity46 ’ form in the @entity57 final and at the @entity40 was down largely to a season on the bench for league games			2
he will not want a repeat of that			0
as things stand neither nor @entity45 nor @entity46 have pushed for a move but @entity47 are pushing for @entity45 and @entity46 would leave for a @entity66 adventure			1
on the way out ? @entity45 is back in training but his stay at @entity1 could be cut short by a transfer down and out : @entity1 wo n't want @entity46 continuing his poor form from the @entity40 at club level @entity22 wanted by : @entity47 , @entity73 , @entity74 @entity26 : £ 40million @entity47 owner @entity75 was at @entity17 ’ presentation yesterday presumably not just to wave goodbye to one of his assets			1
the @entity79 will want to fill the void left by his star player and @entity22 fits the bill , he is even represented by @entity83 who moved @entity17 from @entity84 to @entity85			2
after his sensational season last year @entity47 will not be the only club interested in a player who played wide in a 4 - 3 - 3 and in a 4 - 4 - 2 reaching the @entity40 final and winning the @entity57 final			0
@entity22 pursuit : @entity47 and both @entity93 clubs are keen to sign @entity22 top form : @entity22 had an excellent season for @entity1 last year , including helping to win ' la decima ' @entity96 wanted by : @entity74 @entity26 : £ 30million when @entity98 ’s @entity97 took on @entity99 in the @entity57 two seasons ago @entity17 had a quiet match for @entity99 while @entity96 stole the show for @entity97			1
no - one did more for the midfielder ’s career than the current @entity74 manager and he was very close to moving to the @entity107 last summer but @entity1 promised him the world and he changed his mind			2
this season @entity17 will have to play ahead of @entity96 and it ’s difficult to see how both might play together			2
there might be a different response if @entity98 came calling again			0
wanted man : @entity74 could bid for @entity1 midfielder @entity96 this summer back in action : @entity96 ( left ) is back training with @entity1 but he could find his opportunities limited next season @entity5 / @entity119 / pepe wanted by : @entity5 : @entity24 , @entity48 / @entity119 : @entity25 / @entity120 : @entity74 @entity26 : £ 40million / £ 30million / £ 20million it ’s unlikely these three will move because they would then need to be replaced whereas the aforementioned would not			1
but @entity1 ’s revolving door transfer policy is often driven by demand			0
so if a big bid came in then it would be considered			0
impressing : a series of good performances at the @entity40 means @entity5 is not short of suitors class act : @entity119 is exactly the sort of defender that @entity31 is in the market for we want you to stay : @entity120 is n't necessarily on the market but a big bid could convince @entity1 to sell			1

@entity141 *giants* will fund @entity17 deal by selling established stars
@entity21 , @entity96 and @entity119 could he headed for @entity146
@entity47 are showing an interest in a number of @entity1 *'s* stars
@entity24 would like to take @entity21 , @entity46 and @entity5
@entity25 have shown interest in @entity21 and @entity119
@entity73 and @entity74 fight it out for @entity22
