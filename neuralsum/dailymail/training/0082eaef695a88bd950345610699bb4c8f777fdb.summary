farmers and homeowners across country are spraying herbicides on milkweed plants - and in doing so , they 're causing a massacre of the monarch butterfly			1
when spraying the plant , they 're destroying the iconic orange - and - black butterflies ' nursery , food source and habitat , leaving millions homeless			1
since 1990 , about 970million of the colorful creature have vanished - a 90 per cent decline in the species			1
and in an attempt to counter years of destruction , the @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17 have launched a partnership in hopes of growing milkweed and saving the monarchs			2
species are dying out as their habitats are ruined by herbicides and climate change in an attempt to counter years of destruction , the @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17 have launched a partnership in hopes of growing milkweed about $ 2million of the $ 3.2million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of milkweed ( pictured ) habitat from @entity40 to the @entity41 about $ 2million of the $ 3.2million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of habitat from @entity40 to the @entity41			1
the restoration includes more than 750 schoolyard habitats and pollinator gardens , which could increase , or at least keep stagnant , the number of monarchs in the @entity49			2
each winter , monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles from the @entity49 and @entity52 to central @entity54 forests			1
and in the spring , the insect makes the trek back			0
because butterflies only live for four to five weeks , the trip requires six generations to complete			0
their food supply of milkweed - which is also their home across the @entity49 - is decreasing			1
farmers and homeowners are spraying herbicides , or weed killers , reducing the availability of the plant			2
the monarchs spend their winters in @entity54 mountain forests where climate is less extreme and they have a better chance of survival			0
but nearby human communities rely on the same forests for agriculture and tourist activities			0
climate change disrupts the butterfly 's annual migration pattern by affecting conditions in both winter grounds and summer breading grounds			2
while colder and wetter winters could be lethal to the insects , hotter and drier summers could shift habitats more north			0
source : @entity91 there are about 30million monarch butterflies remaining in the @entity49 , according to the @entity94			1
remaining money will be used to start a conservation fund that will provide grants to farmers and other landowners to conserve habitat			0
the move by the @entity15 comes as it considers whether to classify the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the @entity104 , which would give the butterfly more protection			1
' we can save the monarch butterfly in @entity109 but only if we act quickly and together , ' said service director @entity110			1
monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles to @entity52 from @entity54 each spring on a journey that requires six generations of the insect to complete			1
on the journey , the insect - which only lives for four to five weeks - lays its eggs exclusively on the milkweed plant			1
conversion of prairies into cropland and the increasing use of pesticide - resistant crops have greatly reduced milkweed , which is also an important food source , particularly in the heartland , according to a petition filed last august by environmental groups			1
the conservation projects will be focused on the @entity129 corridor from @entity130 to @entity131 , in areas that provide important spring and summer habitats along the path for about 50 per cent of the migrating monarchs			0
@entity15 is encouraging other federal and state agencies to join in on the project and preserve public land as well			2

@entity152 , too , offers protection for the milkweed plant			2
cities across the @entity49 have declared themselves sanctuaries for monarchs			0
the groups heading the preservation project said the new announcement was a positive step , but the species needs legal protection			0
monarchs are pollinators and indicators of broader environmental problems			0
' the specter of listing will spur a lot of conservation for the monarch , ' said @entity172 , a senior scientist with the @entity173 , one of the groups that asked the @entity15 last august to protect the monarch butterfly and set aside critical habitat			1
but @entity172 said the butterfly needed to be listed for it to recover			0
other species of butterflies have faced extinction in the past , according to @entity15			2
the @entity182 vanished from @entity183 sometime in the mid- 1900s , and two subspecies - the rockland grass skipper and @entity186 in @entity187 - have n't been seen since 2004			0

since 1990 about 970million monarch butterflies have vanished
only about 30million of the iconic orange - and - black insect remain
reduction of milkweed and use of herbicides are ruining the insect 's habitat
a $ 3.2million government project will help restore milkweed plant across @entity49
plant serves as the butterflies ' home and primary source of food
comes as @entity15 considers classifying the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the @entity104
