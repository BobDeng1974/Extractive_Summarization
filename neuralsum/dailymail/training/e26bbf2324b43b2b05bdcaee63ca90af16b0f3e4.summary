the pay divide in @entity2 between the highest and lowest earners has grown more sharply than in any other high - income country since 1975 , a report revealed today			1
the richest 1 per cent have seen their share of total @entity2 income rocket from 7.1 per cent in 1970 to 14.3 per cent in 2005			1
just prior to the global recession , the top 0.1 per cent of top earners accounted for 5 per cent of total pre-tax income			1
rising : @entity2 income inequality has soared since 1975 - from below to well above the @entity13 average			1
it peaked in 2000 but has been on the rise again since 2005			0
the @entity16 also saw steadily increasing income inequality over the period and , apart from a brief period in the early 1990s and around the turn of the century , was more unequal throughout the period			2
a value of 0 indicates a completely equal society , a value of 1 indicates that it is perfectly unequal the research was published as @entity27 promised to give shareholders and employees greater power to block excessive boardroom pay in a crackdown on ' fat cats '			1
recent figures showed that executive pay at the biggest firms rose 50 per cent in the last year , taking the average deal for a @entity39 director to just under £ 2.7million			1
only @entity40 , the @entity16 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 have more unequal societies - but @entity2 has been closing the gap			1
crackdown : @entity27 promised to get employees on executive pay committees as he pledged a crackdown on ' fat cats ' research by the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) found the sharp increase in income inequality leaves @entity2 well above the group 's average			1
inequality in @entity2 peaked in 2000 but after falling it has been rising again since 2005			2
the study - divided we stand : why inequality keeps rising - published by the forum of 34 countries that earn the most , said the annual average income of the top 10 per cent was almost £ 55,000 in 2008 , nearly 12 times higher than that of the bottom 10 per cent , who earned an average of £ 4,700			1
this is up from a ratio of 8 to 1 in 1985 , the @entity13 said			2
although the wealthiest have seen their income soar their tax rate has plummeted in the same period			1
in the 1980s the top rate of tax stood at 60 per cent but it slumped to 40 per cent in the early 2000s			1
the top rate of tax - paid by those earning more than £ 150,000 per year - now stands at 50 per cent			1
the report found that globally income inequality has been rising rapidly - even in countries such as @entity77 and @entity78 which are traditionally more egalitarian societies			2
however , the rise has been sharpest in @entity2			2
yesterday @entity27 said ministers were prepared to bring in legislation to curb ‘ excessive and irresponsible ’ salaries that bear no relation to performance			2
unequal societies : only @entity40 , the @entity16 , @entity41 , @entity43 and @entity42 have a more unequal distribution of income than @entity2			1
the graph goes from he most equal societies on the left to the most unequal societies on the right in terms of disposable income at least 150,000 workers have been paid below the minimum wage because of the downturn , the @entity97 said today			0
an increasing number of workers feel they have been cheated out of wages because of the perilous state of the nations finances			0
the union organisation voiced ' great concern ' about exploitation as it launched a campaign to raise awareness of basic rights at work			0
a guide was published giving workers information about enforcement agencies such as the @entity117 and the @entity118			0
@entity97 deputy general secretary @entity119 said : ' tackling vulnerable employment is a key concern for unions			0
with the labour market struggling to recover from the recession and increasing numbers of those in work facing temporary and insecure employment , action to improve job quality for low - paid workers is as urgent as ever			0
' workers in low - paid sectors such as care , cleaning , hospitality , security and construction can find themselves working excessively long hours , sometimes with no contract of employment			0
' their work can be insecure and they are regularly paid below the minimum wage			0
' mr @entity27 said yesterday : ‘ i think we need to call time on excessive and irresponsible behaviour			2
' just as we have been quite tough on unsustainable and unaffordable things in the public sector , we need to get tough on irresponsible behaviour of top remuneration of executives in the private sector			0
' in order to combat the problem of soaring inequality , the @entity13 said : ' work is the most promising way of tackling inequality			0
' the biggest challenge is creating more and better jobs that offer good career prospects and a real chance to people to escape poverty			0
' it said investing in ' human capital ' is vital			0
' this must begin from early childhood and be sustained through compulsory education , ' it concluded			0
' once the transition from school to work has been accomplished , there must be sufficient incentives for workers and employers to invest in skills throughout the working life			0
' a government spokesman said that reforms in the pipeline will lift a million people out of poverty			0
' the @entity13 recognises that the causes of inequality are complex			0
as we have seen , just putting billions of pounds into the tax and benefit system can not alleviate poverty on its own and has the perverse effect of trapping thousands of families in a life on benefits , ' he said			0
' the @entity13 rightly points out that governments need to facilitate and encourage employment of low income groups - something we are directly focusing on through the @entity202 and @entity203			2
rising inequality : the richest 0.1 % ( bottom dotted line ) have seen their share of @entity2 income soar since the 1970s			1
likewise , after a fall , the top 1 % have also seen a significant increase in their income			1
although the wealthiest people in @entity2 have done well since 1970 , the majority have seen their share of @entity2 income decline 50p tax : @entity2 has the highest top tax band out of these eight countries at 50 %			1
however , it is down from 60 % in 1981			1
the most remarkable feature of the table is the amount by which the top rate of tax has decreased since 1981			2
in the @entity16 it was 70 % in 1981 but just half of that , 35 % , in 2010 ' our wide - ranging reforms will have a dramatic impact on the poorest families , improving the life chances of children at an early age and lifting almost a million people out of poverty through the @entity203			2
' @entity238 union leader @entity237 said : ' far from all being in it together , the rich are getting richer while working families are taking the biggest hit on their standards of living since wartime rationing			0
' this government continues to pedal the lie that we are all sharing the pain while the boardrooms are awash with cash and those whose rampant greed created the crisis are laughing all the way to the bank			0
' soaring : the richest 1 % took home 7.1 % of all pay in the @entity2 in 1970 - but by 2005 this had risen to 14.3 %			1
almost everywhere the top 1 % have seen their share of the national wealth increase since 1970			1
in the @entity16 they owned the most - 17.7 % of national income in 2008 , up from 7.8 % in 1970			1

top 1 % earn 14.3 % of total @entity2 income - *double* their 7.1 % share in 1970
tax rate for rich falls from 60 % in the 1980s to 50 %
