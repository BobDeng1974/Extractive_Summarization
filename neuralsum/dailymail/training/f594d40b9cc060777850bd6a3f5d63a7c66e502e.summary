@entity0 , 62 , killed his former partner @entity2 with a kitchen knife at the flat she had moved into in @entity11 after their relationship began to fail			1
@entity14 heard he left her dying on the floor after she threatened to stop him from seeing his granddaughter and then returned home to drink a beer and smoke a cigar			1
@entity0 was cleared of murder by a jury yesterday but had already admitted manslaughter			1
sentencing @entity25 today , the judge , mr @entity24 , said he did not accept @entity0 's argument that at no point did he intend to kill , pointing to the severity of the injuries he inflicted on ms @entity30			1
the jury had heard how the defendant and his family appeared in a 2012 episode of @entity35 , featuring @entity36			1
the programme was about one of @entity25 's businesses - @entity40 , in @entity41 , @entity11			0
@entity30 and his partner had been together for 30 years but had drifted apart after their three sons had grown up			1
@entity30 , 61 , who took her partner 's name despite never marrying him , went to live in a flat while @entity30 remained at the family home in @entity50 , @entity11			1
on april 14 this year , @entity25 went round to the flat and after ms @entity30 told him she hated him and asked him to leave , he stabbed his estranged partner in a ' sustained attack '			1
the judge said he sentenced on the basis that the jury must have decided that @entity25 had suffered a ' loss of control ' at the time of the attack			2
he said he accepted that ms @entity30 had been contemptuous in her comments to him as their relationship deteriorated and she had threatened him with a knife on three occasions			1
the judge said : ' people who wish to end their relationships and live alone without their former partner are entitled to do so without being killed			2
' it is clear that for nearly ten years you had been living increasingly separate lives under the same roof			2
' you spent many nights in the pub and in your den drinking too much			0
' she was no doubt lonely and frustrated with what her life had become			0
' she came to despise you as a weak father and a drunk , and said frequently that she deserved better than you			0
' with a degree of cruelty she even said you were not a good father			0
' this happened principally because you could not let go			1
the threat in relation to you granddaughter was the straw which broke the camel 's back			0
' forensic officers at a property in @entity50 , @entity108 , where 61 - year - old @entity30 was found dead ' it was your view that your family life really was over that led to your loss of control			1
' your granddaughter was very important to you and in your desperate state the prospect of no longer going out with her overwhelmed you			0
that was a serious verbal threat to something you hold very precious			0
' he added : ' in that state of mind you formed the intention to kill her			0
the evidence is not compelling because you say you can not completely remember what happened			2
' he added : ' i 'm unable to say exactly how the knife ended up in your hand			0
' ' you drove the knife deep into her left shoulder and sliced into her neck in a deliberate motion and drove it into her right shoulder			0
' i reject your your explanation this was accidental as you fell			0
something happened in that room which you have not told us about			2
' had you not intended she would die you would have called an ambulance			0
instead you took out the knife , washed it and took the dog back to the family home			0
miss @entity148 had tried to turn around the fortunes of the family 's furniture store and funeral directors in @entity41 when the family 's business was featured in the show , the @entity5 programme said : ' @entity158 's furniture has been run by @entity0 and his family for 33 years , but it just has n't moved on in that time ' ' when your son @entity160 saw you , you said ' i think i 've killed your mother '			1
i think you knew she was dead when you left her flat			0
' sending the disgraced boss down the cell , @entity24 said : ' you have still not faced up squarely to what you did			0
' the couple 's middle son , @entity160 , saw his father walk in with blood on his face , carrying a blood - stained orange towel @entity30 stood with his head bowed as he was sentenced , sporting short dark hair and dark - rimmed glasses			2
he was wearing a grey suit with a light blue shirt and patterned blue tie			0
detective chief inspector @entity180 , of @entity181 , said @entity30 attacked his ex-partner ' sustained and violent attack ' he said : ' @entity0 has been convicted of killing of his long - term partner @entity30 , after she left him to embark on a new life without him ' after more than 40 years together @entity2 decided to leave @entity0 , sadly this was something he could not come to terms with			1
' on the morning of april 14 , @entity0 visited @entity2 at her new home			1
it was whilst there that an argument developed			0
' mr @entity0 then armed himself with a large knife and carried out a sustained and violent attack on @entity2 , which resulted in her immediate death			1
' @entity2 was devoted mother and grandmother and was loved by many			2
his actions that day have without doubt had a profound effect on all those who knew and loved @entity2			2
' @entity0 will now for the rest of his life have to live with the consequences of his actions that fateful morning			2
' i hope that after today 's sentencing , the family of @entity2 can in some way start to rebuild and move on with their lives			1
