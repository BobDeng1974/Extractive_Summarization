there are two options open to @entity2 when he enters the cauldron of @entity5 ’s @entity4 this saturday night to challenge @entity6 for the super-bantamweight championship of the world			1
‘ @entity9 , ’ says @entity6			1
‘ it ’s up to him			0
‘ i hope it ’s fight because that will be more entertaining for the fans and better for me			0
‘ but this is the hottest atmosphere for any sporting event in @entity18 these days and there ’s no telling which way my opponents will react when it hits them			0
’ @entity6 attends a press conference ahead of his world title defence against @entity2 the @entity26 world super bantamweight champion exchanges words with the @entity29 - @entity28 challenger the fight will be broadcast on @entity31 in big - time boxing 's first return for nearly a decade @entity6 sits with his young daughter , @entity35 , and mother , @entity37 ( left ) , ahead of the press conference @entity6 knocks down @entity39 during their @entity26 super-bantamweight world title bout in september @entity6 is optimistic that @entity2 , an archetypal @entity29 - @entity28 warrior by reputation , is coming to play his part in a spectacle which will carry the fanaticism for @entity45 across to mainland @entity46 as well as expand the audience for boxing in this country			1
the excitement surrounding @entity6 has encouraged @entity31 to bring prize - fighting back to mainstream terrestrial television here for the first time in almost a decade			1
it gives @entity6 ’s promoter and mentor – @entity5 ’s legendary former world champion @entity57 – the chance to generate wider public interest in his protege not just in @entity46 but around the world			1
this fight is being broadcast live in 55 other countries , including the @entity28 where expectation is mounting for a title unification match between @entity6 and @entity68 ’s ex-amateur genius @entity66			1
before travelling to @entity28 , @entity6 is more than willing to hop over to @entity69 this summer to put his @entity26 belt on the line in a battle of @entity46 with @entity75 ’s ‘ regular ’ @entity74 champion @entity73			1
both those fights have the potential to elevate @entity6 from @entity5 folk hero to global stardom but he knows that depends , firstly , on a stellar performance against @entity82			1
@entity2 is expected to provide a stiff challenge for the reigning champion in @entity5 on saturday the @entity85 is managed by former boxing great @entity57 ( left ) the challenger engages in some word sparring with @entity6 ahead of the main event on saturday @entity2 defeats @entity90 in round 10 of their super bantamweight clash in 2011 ‘ i ’m under no illusions about this , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m on the brink of something big now			0
i ca n’t afford any slip - ups at this stage and i need to continue to impress			0
there ’s too much at stake			0
’ in that realisation @entity6 has worked harder than ever under his trainer , @entity57 ’s son @entity109 , in the intense confines of their gym in @entity108 ’s increasingly fashionable @entity107			2
at just turned 28 – last saturday - and @entity110 ’s in his perfect 19 - win record – he stands ready to deliver again			0
‘ i ’m pretty confident of knocking @entity2 out , ’ he says thoughtfully , without bombast			2
‘ he ’s a very good fighter and i expect him to be tougher than @entity73 when we get round to that one			0
but because he usually comes on the offensive and leaves himself open to be hit i do think i will stop him			0
’ @entity6 has put in more than 200 rounds of sparring against high - quality fighters , some of them markedly bigger than himself			2
with none of them proving able to go 12 rounds with him , that chore has been shared among them when he insists boxing the full championship distance			0
it is not only to ensure victory over @entity82 , his mandatory challenger , that @entity6 is living the @entity130 life demanded of all who would be great champions			2
@entity6 poses for pictures ahead of a public workout in @entity134 , @entity5 @entity2 takes part in the public workout in the @entity5 shopping mall ‘ my ambition is not celebrity but to become acknowledged as the best super-bantamweight , ’ he says			1
‘ and at some point soon that will mean beating not only @entity73 but @entity66 , who everyone considers the greatest and i understand why at the moment			2
‘ then , if i can do that , i will move up in weight in the hope that being a two - division world champion might be enough for me to be elected to the @entity148			0
’ @entity6 would like to add a win over @entity151 super-bantamweight belt holder , @entity152 , to that resume but that @entity28 - based @entity29 no longer appears as willing to face him as @entity2			1
since joining the growing stable of top fighters in advisor @entity157 ’s stable , @entity156 has not only veered away from a big fight with @entity66 but also seems to be losing enthusiasm for taking on @entity6 in either a @entity5 stadium or in @entity28			1
that increases the demands on @entity6 to impress this weekend and then , probably , against @entity73 in early summer			2
but he says : ‘ i ’m used to the pressure because i know i carry so many hopes for @entity5 and @entity166 with me into the ring			2
’ @entity6 works out as he sets his sights on a unification fight with @entity66 @entity6 poses @entity171 's @entity170 ( left ) and @entity57 ( right ) in a @entity107 gym @entity6 ’s title - winning triumph over @entity39 drew a 20,000 crowd to an open - air pop - arena in the historic dockyards where the @entity178 was constructed – drawn from both sides of the sectarian divide , with men , women and children united in their vociferous support for this young @entity185 who is happily married to a @entity187			1
but it is within the confines of the @entity4 that they raise the roof			0
expect the crescendo to come with @entity6 landing his ko in or near the eighth round			0
@entity6 v @entity82 is live on @entity194 from 10pm , preceded by the undercard on @entity196 .			0

@entity6 will defend his @entity26 super bantamweight world title against @entity2 in @entity5 on saturday
the fight will be broadcast on terrestrial tv and in 55 other countries
