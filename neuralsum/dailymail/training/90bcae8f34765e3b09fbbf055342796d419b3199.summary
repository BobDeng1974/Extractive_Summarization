by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 9 march 2013 when @entity3 took early retirement from his job in publishing , he and wife @entity1 planned to buy a guesthouse in @entity8 to provide them with some income			1
instead they ended up purchasing a 16th century cottage , mill and a museum crammed with 5,000 artefacts – from @entity17 farm implements to an early @entity19 iron			1
‘ when we saw that it was for sale we were n’t that interested but we thought that a trip to see it would make a nice day out , ’ recalls @entity3 , 62			2
‘ after walking around the house and museum , we looked at each other and said , “ wow ”			1
we told the owner we ’d buy it			2
’ flour power : @entity3 and @entity30 are selling @entity31 and the @entity32 in @entity33 in @entity34 as a working , live - in , museum the couple paid £ 375,000 for @entity31 , @entity38 and @entity39 in 2002 and although they then had little knowledge of ancient history , the flour business or the tourist trade , they soon became accomplished curators who can describe in detail every artefact from a 5,000 - year - old grinding stone to a @entity49 washing machine			1
@entity3 has even restored the mill to produce organic flour			1
the business is in the pretty coastal village of @entity33 , near @entity54			1
currently , it brings in about £ 60,000 a year but the couple , who are now retiring and selling up , believe it could produce far more			1
they point out that the museum , for which they charge a £ 3.75 entrance fee , could be kept open for more months of the year , the mill could be run harder and their four - bedroom cottage could be converted into a holiday let			1
‘ it ’s a lovely business , ’ says @entity3			2
‘ we ’ve deliberately kept sales below the vat threshold of £ 73,000 but there ’s huge potential			1
’ the museum , which has sections dedicated to farming , mining and shoemaking , is closed in winter and rarely opens on saturdays during summer months			1
‘ at the moment we mill about half a ton of flour a month in the summer and sell it to six shops but we could easily sell to 60 , ’ says @entity1 , 55 , a former magazine editor			1
‘ if we were staying i ’d also like to convert the gift shop into a bakery			2
’ artifacts : the @entity31 which celebrates farming , mining and homemaking , was opened in 1937 and has 5,000 items on display back in 2002 , the house needed extensive repairs , which cost £ 60,000			1
‘ the previous owner had poured concrete down the chimney to block it and it took three weeks to dig it out			2
there was a lot of other structural work – we had new doors made , laid a stone floor in the kitchen and put in new central heating and a sewage treatment plant , ’ says @entity3			0
he seems most proud of the watermill , which was restored in 2009			0
the couple started milling the following year			2
the museum was started in 1937 by a former colonel in the @entity109 with a special interest in primitive farming methods , and it has a great reputation , drawing in people from around the globe			1
‘ our oldest pieces are grinding querns from about @entity118 – there are three in the @entity120 , but we ’ve got 12 , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ however , the most talked - about piece is a @entity123 washing machine			0
’ the site attracts 10,000 visitors a year , including ironing enthusiasts , drawn not just to early charcoal models but also to a modern @entity19			0
yet one of the couple ’s biggest tasks is turning pieces away			0
‘ people bring artefacts to us all the time but we just do n’t have the space , ’ says @entity3			0
since the business went up for sale for £ 895,000 , it has attracted interest from the @entity141			1
a spokesman says : ‘ @entity31 and its regionally and nationally important collection must rank as one of the most outstanding potential archaeological acquisitions that we have considered for a long time			1
’ unfortunately , the @entity141 does not have funds to buy it			0
two other offers have since come in from people wanting to split and sell the collection , which the @entity152 rejected			0
‘ we do n’t have a legal obligation to run the museum but we do have a personal one			2
and if we did decide to put everything on @entity159 , the villagers would lynch us , ’ jokes @entity1			0
the property sits in a delightful village			0
@entity33 , famed for a legend about a mermaid who is said to have swum up a local river and appeared in the village church , is a ten - minute walk from the sea			0
when the @entity170 do find a buyer , they wo n’t be going far			0
‘ when we came here from @entity178 , our eldest two children were finishing university and only our youngest , @entity172 , who was about to start a degree at @entity174 , came with us , ’ says @entity3			0
‘ she later met and married the son of the farmer next door and she ’s due to give birth to their third child in august , so we want to be near our grandchildren			0
