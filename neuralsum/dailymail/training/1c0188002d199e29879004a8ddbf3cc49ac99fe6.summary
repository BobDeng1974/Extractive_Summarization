@entity0 has spotted a mysterious methane cloud high in the atmosphere of @entity4 's @entity3			1
they say the phenomenon is similar to exotic clouds found far above @entity9 's poles			1
this lofty cloud , imaged by @entity0 's @entity12 spacecraft , was part of the winter cap of condensation over @entity3 's north pole			1
this cloud in the stratosphere over @entity3 's north pole contains methane ice , which was not previously thought to form in that part of the atmosphere			1
@entity12 first spotted the cloud in 2006			0
the newly identified cloud instead developed in the stratosphere , the layer above the troposphere			0
@entity9 has its own polar stratospheric clouds , which typically form above the @entity28 and @entity29 between 49,000 and 82,000 feet ( 15 to 25 kilometers ) - well above cruising altitude for airplanes			2
these rare clouds do n't form until the temperature drops to minus 108 degrees @entity34 ( minus 78 degrees @entity35 )			0
now , eight years after spotting this mysterious bit of atmospheric fluff , researchers have determined that it contains methane ice , which produces a much denser cloud than the ethane ice previously identified there			0
' the idea that methane clouds could form this high on @entity3 is completely new , ' said @entity46 , a @entity12 participating scientist at @entity0 's @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , and lead author of the study			1
' nobody considered that possible before			0
' methane clouds were already known to exist in @entity3 's troposphere , the lowest layer of the atmosphere			1
like rain and snow clouds on @entity9 , those clouds form through a cycle of evaporation and condensation , with vapor rising from the surface , encountering cooler and cooler temperatures and falling back down as precipitation			1
on @entity3 , however , the vapor at work is methane instead of water			2
the newly identified cloud instead developed in the stratosphere , the layer above the troposphere			0
@entity9 has its own polar stratospheric clouds , which typically form above the @entity28 and @entity29 between 49,000 and 82,000 feet ( 15 to 25 kilometers ) - well above cruising altitude for airplanes			2
these rare clouds do n't form until the temperature drops to minus 108 degrees @entity34 ( minus 78 degrees @entity35 )			0
other stratospheric clouds had been identified on @entity3 already , including a very thin , diffuse cloud of ethane , a chemical formed after methane breaks down			2
delicate clouds made from cyanoacetylene and hydrogen cyanide , which form from reactions of methane byproducts with nitrogen molecules , also have been found there			2
but methane clouds were thought unlikely in @entity3 's stratosphere			1
because the troposphere traps most of the moisture , stratospheric clouds require extreme cold			0
even the stratosphere temperature of minus 333 degrees @entity34 ( minus 203 degrees @entity35 ) , observed by @entity12 just south of the equator , was not frigid enough to allow the scant methane in this region of the atmosphere to condense into ice			0
@entity9 's polar stratospheric clouds , similar to the cloud in the stratosphere over @entity3 's north pole what @entity108 and her @entity110 co-author , @entity109 , found is that temperatures in @entity3 's lower stratosphere are not the same at all latitudes			1
data from @entity12 's @entity117 and the spacecraft 's radio science instrument showed that the high - altitude temperature near the north pole was much colder than that just south of the equator			1
it turns out that this temperature difference -- as much as 11 degrees @entity34 ( minus 12 degrees @entity35 ) -- is more than enough to yield methane ice			0
@entity3 has a global circulation pattern in which warm air in the summer hemisphere wells up from the surface and enters the stratosphere , slowly making its way to the winter pole			1
there , the air mass sinks back down , cooling as it descends , which allows the stratospheric methane clouds to form			0
the mechanism for forming these high - altitude clouds appears to be different from what happens in the troposphere			0

' @entity12 has been steadily gathering evidence of this global circulation pattern , and the identification of this new methane cloud is another strong indicator that the process works the way we think it does , ' said @entity153 , @entity110 scientist and principal investigator for @entity12 's @entity117 ( @entity155 )			0
' @entity3 continues to amaze with natural processes similar to those on the @entity9 , yet involving materials different from our familiar water , ' said @entity161 , @entity12 deputy project scientist at @entity0 's @entity162 ( @entity162 ) in @entity163 , @entity164			1
' as we approach southern winter solstice on @entity3 , we will further explore how these cloud formation processes might vary with season			2
