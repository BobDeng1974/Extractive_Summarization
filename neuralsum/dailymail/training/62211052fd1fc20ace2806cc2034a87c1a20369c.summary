the @entity1 naturalist who filmed himself getting eaten by an anaconda for a highly - anticipated television event has spoken out about what inspired him to take part in the risky stunt			1
this past summer , @entity7 donned a special suit to let a 25 - foot 400 - pound snake eat him in a dangerous performance set to air on @entity11 this sunday			1
overall , @entity7 was so confident in the suit 's design that he was more worried about the snake 's safety than his own			1
' i did n’t want to stress [ the snake ] out too much			0
i wanted to make sure that the suit was smooth and was n’t going to hurt the snake , ' @entity7 said			2
' i really was n’t scared			0
we tested this suit and worked on this with experts so we knew i was going to be safe			0
' amid a backlash from animal rights activists who believe the anaconda was tortured by being forced to eat @entity7 , a man much bigger than its usual prey , @entity7 has responded to say the snake was unharmed and that the experiment was designed to raise money to save the animal 's habitat			1

none of the following pictures show the anaconda used in the stunt good cause : @entity7 says he participated in the risky act in order to raise awareness of the anaconda 's habitat , which is being encroached on by gold mining ' i wanted to do something that would absolutely shock people , ' @entity7 told the @entity54			1
' environmentalists , we love to preach to the choir			0
what i ’m trying to do with this is bring in a bunch of people that would n’t necessarily know what ’s going on in the @entity62			0
' @entity63 : the special to air sunday will reportedly advertise a fundraiser to save the snake 's habitat ' for the type of attention that this is getting and for the type of emergency that ’s going on down there — desperate times , desperate measures			1
' ' once they see the show , these are people who are going to be supporters ' he said			0
' it ’s a cool little dissonance there — they ’re all coming out against me , but i ’m the guy that ’s been down there in the jungle trying to protect these things			0
' @entity7 , a @entity87 native who first visited the @entity62 at age 18 , spent 60 days hiking through the rain forest in @entity90 with a team of about a dozen people searching for the right anaconda to take part in the stunt			1
in the process , the team also started the first scientific study of anacondas in the wild , taking down the weight , length and sex of each snake they came across			0
they also took samples of their skin to test for mercury , a by - product of the gold - mining industry which is encroaching on the creature 's habitat			1
the special on sunday will be promoting a fundraiser to raise money to save the snake 's habitat			1
the naturalist and his crew had nearly run out of the time allotted by the @entity11 when they finally tracked down a female green anaconda that @entity7 first spotted in 2008			1
he says it took 12 people fighting in water above their heads to catch the 25 - foot 400 - 500 pound anaconda , adding that herpetologists were on site to make sure the snake was in good health throughout its short captivity			2
armor : in order to survive being eaten by the snake , @entity7 wore a custom - designed suit that protected him from the snake 's strong grasp and digestive acids			1
it also packed cameras , communication devices and enough air to last him three hours not an easy job : it took a team of 12 to capture the snake used in the stunt			0
above , @entity7 pictured on the hunt in the @entity62 from there , @entity7 put on a special suit made of carbon fiber designed to protect against both the snake 's deadly grip and digestive acids			1
the suit also packed a three - hour supply of oxygen , communication devices and several cameras			0
before going through with the effort , @entity7 also swallowed a pill that transmitted his vitals to his team			0
in order to attract the snakes 's attention , @entity7 doused himself in pigs blood and imitated movements of the anaconda 's typical prey			2
the snakes usually hunt wild pigs , deer , capybaras and caiman			0
@entity7 says ' it did n't take long ' for the anaconda to fall for the maneuver , but would n't elaborate on what actually happened once the snake tried to swallow him whole			2
' experiencing that kind of power was worth everything , because it was just amazing , ' he said			0
