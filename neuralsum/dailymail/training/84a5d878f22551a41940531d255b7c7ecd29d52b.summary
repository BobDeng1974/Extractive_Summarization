by @entity0 a @entity2 restaurant has removed two naked 50ft statues of @entity4 from its roof just two days after putting them up because they offended believers			1
the statues were a reference to a old @entity2 wives ' tale involving @entity14 monks , which features one of them scrambling over a wall to try some soup			1
@entity14 followers , known for their peaceful ways , were so angered by their religions leader being used as an advert that they began protesting outside the eatery , demanding the figures be taken down			2
@entity25 has removed two 50ft naked @entity4 statues from the roof of his restaurant just two days after putting them up because they offended local @entity30 the images were a reference to an old @entity2 wives ' tale , in which a @entity14 monk jumps over a wall to try some soup			1
a poet supposedly remarked that @entity4 himself would have done the same according to the legend a scholar travelling by foot used to carry ingredients for the soup in a clay pot , and heat them up when he stopped for rest			0
the story goes that while warming the dish near a @entity14 temple , one of the monks could not resist the smell and jumped over a wall to try it , causing a poet among them to remark that @entity4 himself would have done the same			2
@entity25 , who owns the restaurant in @entity56 , in @entity2 's @entity58 province , said : ' i did n't intend to offend anyone and in fact there is a very popular dish that we also make here known as @entity65 , which is extremely popular in this part of the world and everybody eats it			1
there are various different versions of the tale , but it is thought to be a fake designed to help sell @entity65 soup - served at mr @entity25 's restaurant - which translates as ' @entity4 leaps off the wall ' @entity14 followers were said to be so angry at the depiction of their spiritual leader climbing over the building that normally pacifist followers started protesting outside ' the dish translates as " @entity4 leaps off the wall "			1
i simply meant to advertise that and as everybody knows the dish did n't think that would be a problem			0
' while different versions of the story are told across the whole of @entity2 , it is likely to be made up as a marketing trick in order to sell the expensive meal			0
recipes for the soup also differ , but usually include a variety of expensive ingredients , such as venison , shark fin , sea cucumber , shiitake mushrooms , herbs such as ginseng and wolfberries , @entity107 rice wine , bamboo shoots , pork , duck , quail 's eggs and stock			0
mr @entity25 has since apologised , saying that because the dish was popular he thought the statues would n't offend anyone the ingredients are combined in a large clay pot , covered with wine and stock and then boiled very slowly for a long time			0
it is a delicacy which is not widely available , and must usually be bought from specialist restaurants , such as the one owned by mr @entity25 .			0

restaurant owner @entity25 *unveiled* the two 50ft statues last week at his restaurant in @entity56 , @entity58 province
they reference a @entity2 tale in which a @entity14 monk jumps over a wall for some soup which was being warmed up nearby , causing a poet to say that @entity4 would have done the same
@entity25 's restaurant serves a soup called @entity65 which translates as ' @entity136 '
however , local @entity30 were offended at their spiritual leader being used as an advert and protested outside
now , just two days after they were first put up , @entity25 has been forced to take them down
