by @entity0 a group of parents of autistic children have come forward with complaints against a special needs school in @entity6 with allegations that staff locked children in a darkened room , led them around the hallways on leashes and wrapped one boy in a blanket to restrain him			1
two parents have taken their case to the @entity17 and a third is currently before the @entity19 over incidents that allegedly occurred between 2010 and 2012 at @entity21 in @entity22 , which caters for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities			1
the woman before the tribunal , who is suing the @entity28 government and who can not be named , has alleged teachers locked her son in a fenced - off courtyard as a form of punishment and restrained him during school assemblies , even though he found them distressing			1
@entity36 ( centre ) , holding her daughter @entity38 , has complained to the @entity39 about the treatment of her son @entity41 ( in green ) , whom she claims was locked ' terrified ' in a dark room as a punishment			1
@entity44 ( back row , right ) is also complaining to the @entity39 about the school 's treatment of his twin boys @entity49 and @entity50 ( front , in striped jumpers ) another woman , @entity22 mother @entity36 , is taking action through the @entity39 on the basis that her son was discriminated against because of his disabilities , after finding him locked in a darkened room for misbehaving			1
on march 6 , 2012 , ms @entity36 was asked to come to the school to pick up her son @entity41 , now 11 , who had apparently been acting up in class			1
according to the teacher 's notes , he had refused to do the work set for him , but was not acting in a violent or threatening manner			0
when ms @entity36 went to collect him , she found him locked in the ' time - out room ' , a dark empty room ' about the size of a disabled toilet			1
' @entity41 was lying on the floor of the small room , which had a boarded up window and the lights switched off			0
she said that at the time it happened , he was ' terrified ' of the dark , so she could n't imagine that he had turned off the lights himself			2
' i saw him lying on the floor , crying his eyes out , he had a ( self - inflicted ) bloody nose … when i opened the door he jumped up and he was like : " mum , take me home "			2
' ms @entity36 found @entity41 locked in the room on two other occasions			2
the second time , which occurred on march 10 , 2012 , a small chair had been left in the room , which ms @entity36 said could have been a safety risk			2
' if he is in a fit of rage , all he has to do is trip over , impale himself [ on the chair ] and no one would know , ' she said			0
@entity44 took his twin sons @entity50 ( left ) and @entity49 out of @entity21 amid concerns about their treatment @entity50 ( left ) and @entity98 left the school in 2012 after their father allegedly saw children being led around with leashes another parent , who does not wish to be named because her daughter still attends the school and who is yet to take any legal action , said that children at the school know the room as a ' punishment room '			1
on one occasion , the woman 's daughter told her that a teacher dragged her in there ' kicking and screaming '			2
the girl was put into the room toward the end of the school day and did not understand what was happening			2
' she honestly thought , because there was no answer when she was kicking and screaming , she actually thought she 'd been pushed in there , locked in there and had been left there for the night , ' said the woman			2
@entity128 , a disability advocate for the @entity130 , who is helping all the parents with their claims , said : ' the purpose of these rooms is to punish the child , it 's a very barbaric way of dealing with challenging behaviours and complex disabilities … it 's just 19th century stuff			1
' ms @entity128 says the parents have been ' pushed into ' taking legal action because the @entity28 @entity142 has ignored their requests for an investigation and seems ' completely disinterested ' in the issue			2
the alleged incidents took place between 2010 and 2012			1
the school denies the parents ' claims she claims that when the parents initially voiced their concerns last year , the @entity142 responded by sending someone to the school to look at its current practices			1
' that is a cover - up			1
if [ the @entity142 ] were concerned , they 'd get an independent inquiry , ' said ms @entity128			0
she also alleges that stories of the ' time - out room ' are ' just the tip of the iceberg '			0
ms @entity36 said her first indication that anything was wrong at the school came in 2009 , just one year after her son began attending @entity169 , when she saw a teacher wrap up a distressed child in a blanket ' like a sausage roll ' and drag him along the corridor			0
the boy , aged 10 or 11 , had become upset when he dropped a stress ball he had been carrying while walking back to class , said ms @entity36			0
when he tried to go back so he could pick up his toy , three teachers threw a blanket on the ground , tackled him , wrapped him up in the blanket and dragged him down the corridor , she claims			0
' i was just shocked			0
i do n't know this child , so i did n't know what his issues are			0
but he was n't doing anything , he just wanted his ball , ' said ms @entity36			0
one woman alleges teachers at @entity21 locked her son in a courtyard ( pictured ) and left him there unsupervised , as a punishment for misbehaving she also alleges that the teachers would use physical restraint to get children to perform in @entity198 concerts			1
' at a @entity198 concert , a child would go to walk off stage			0
[ the teachers ] would grab them and walk them back onstage … if that did n't work , they 'd get them to sit down and they 'd sit behind them and restrain them with both arms , sort of bear hug them , ' she said			0
@entity44 pulled his twin sons , @entity49 and @entity50 , from the school in 2012 after he became concerned about their treatment and he has since complained to the @entity39 about the school			1
mr @entity44 said he saw children being led around the school on leashes , attached to harnesses around their chests and at least in one case this was done without the consent of the parents			1
' my understanding was that the mother was not happy with him being put in the harness , ' he said			0
mr @entity44 was also concerned about the emphasis the school placed on medicating the children			2
' almost everyone was pushed to have their kids on medication , ' he said			0
' when i removed [ sons @entity49 and @entity50 ] off @entity235 , [ the school ] went over my head to child protection trying to force me to keep them on the @entity235 , and i had to leave them on it , ' he said			0
mr @entity44 says the school would refuse to communicate with parents and would not seek alternative ways of treating the children , even if the methods they were employing were not working			1
' they were putting my boys into isolation and time out and their tantrums and mood swings would worsen , yet they continued to do this as a means of punishment instead of looking at other solutions , ' he said			0
since mr @entity44 removed the children from the school in 2012 he has seen a marked improvement in their development and behaviour			1
' the boys have come so far … they 're starting to read , they 're stringing words together , ' he said			0
' it 's not a miracle , it 's the fact that they 're in a school that knows what they 're doing , ' he said			0
all allegations were put to the school and the @entity142			2
a spokesperson for the @entity142 and @entity275 said they were satisfied by ' current practices ' at @entity21 and stated : ' @entity277 denies the allegations and will vigorously defend the matter at @entity19			1
' the principal of @entity21 , @entity280 denied that the school ever punishes children by isolating them or leaving them outside without teacher supervision , adding : ' our school is a very caring school where the students are at the centre of everything we do			1
' the case is currently before the @entity19 .			0
