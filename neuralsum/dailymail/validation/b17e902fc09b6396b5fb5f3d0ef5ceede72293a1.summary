rounding up sheep successfully is a difficult task usually reserved for experienced shepherds and their sheepdog			1
but it looks like there might be something else working the fields in the future			2
new footage shows how a drone can herd around 120 sheep across a field and through a narrow gateway within minutes			1
the drone remains behind them at all times and makes them walk forward as a group until they get to a gate			2
it even shows off its manoeuvrability by flying close to the ground before zooming into the sky to get the last three animals into the next field			2
the footage - titled ' @entity38 , @entity40 ' ( sic ) - has already been viewed more than 82,000 times on @entity42			0
as the farmer and photographer stand in one corner of the field the drone does all of the hard work , forcing the sheep towards the gate the sheep stay in a group while the drone flies behind them			1
the animals appear to react to the slight movement of the nifty aircraft the footage of the sheep was captured by @entity59 , who specialises in aerial photography for farmers the final sheep make their way through the gate ( left ) and into the next field minutes after the drone ( stock image right ) started its work it was captured by @entity59 , who specialises in aerial photography for farmers			1
