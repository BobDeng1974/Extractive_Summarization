the @entity1 home of @entity3 chief @entity2 , the place where he was killed after the biggest manhunt in history , is no more			1
@entity1 security forces completed the demolition of @entity2 's compound on sunday , erasing a symbol of humiliation for @entity1 's military that has marked one of the most difficult periods in @entity16 - @entity1 ties			1
@entity2 was killed in the house in @entity18 on may 2 , 2011 by @entity16 commandos in a daring night raid that left the @entity1 military angry it had not been consulted			1
while much of the world cheered the death , @entity1 fumed over what it called a violation of its sovereignty			1
' the whole structure of the building has been razed to the ground			0
it actually took some time as the process of demolition and removing the wreckage was going on simultaneously			0
' why @entity1 authorities decided to demolish the structure now is unclear			0
@entity1 was outraged by the covert @entity16 raid in the northwestern town of @entity18 because it was not informed beforehand - a decision the @entity16 explained was driven by concerns that someone in the government might tip off @entity2			2
the terror leader 's death was cheered across the globe , but many @entity1 were angry that the @entity16 violated its territory and that its troops were powerless to stop @entity16 soldiers from attacking a compound located next to the country 's elite military academy			1
the backhoes - heavy machines with strong crane - like digging arms - have torn down the tall boundary walls around @entity2 's compound and have destroyed more than half of the main building , where the @entity3 chief lived for years with his wives and children			2
@entity83 soldiers who were guarding the compound saturday night handed authority over to the police in the morning and left			0
work continued sunday morning but halted around midday for unknown reasons			0
work begins : @entity1 security personnel start the demolition of the compound where @entity2 was killed in may 2011 @entity1 officials have declined to say why they decided to begin demolition			1
residents of the normally sleepy town of @entity18 were divided on what the government should do with the compound in the aftermath of the raid			0
some thought it should be destroyed , but others believed it should be turned into a tourist attraction to help the town earn money			0
there was always the danger , however , that it could also draw @entity3 supporters			0
pulled down : the destruction of the building brings an end to the a stain on @entity1 's history and remained a start remainder of the @entity3 leader and in turn the atrocities committed on 9/11 the three - storey compound , pictured , where @entity2 spent his last years and was killed by @entity16 commandos is being demolished @entity16 officials said they buried @entity2 's body at sea to avoid giving his followers a burial place that could become a makeshift shrine			1
many @entity16 officials expressed disbelief that @entity2 could have lived in @entity18 for around six years without the @entity1 government knowing			2
but the @entity16 has not found any evidence that senior @entity1 officials knew of the @entity3 chief 's whereabouts			2
the @entity136 who attacked @entity2 's compound on may 2 infiltrated by helicopter from neighboring @entity140			2
the raid , which lasted around 40 minutes , was a serious blow to the already troubled @entity16 - @entity1 relationship			0
inside the compound : an image showing @entity2 in the shabby @entity18 compound surrounded by @entity147 , a pc , digital decoder and a boster pillow this well - known image captures the moment president @entity152 , vice president @entity153 and members of the national security team saw @entity2 's compound raised and him killed live @entity1 responded by kicking out more than 100 @entity16 troops training @entity1 in counterterrorism operations and reduced the level of intelligence cooperation			1
some members of @entity162 called on the @entity16 to cut of the billions of dollars of military and civilian aid to @entity1 unless @entity164 explained @entity2 's presence in @entity18 and boosted cooperation on the @entity140 war			1
the aid has continued , although at a somewhat lower level .			0
