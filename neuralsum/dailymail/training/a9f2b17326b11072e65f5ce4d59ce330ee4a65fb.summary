@entity0 today pledges to protect a raft of pensioner benefits to ensure ' dignity and security in retirement '			2
in a major pitch to grey voters , the prime minister will vow to continue paying for the winter fuel allowance , free bus passes , tv licences , prescriptions and eye tests for as long as he is in @entity14			1
he will repeat the pledge , which he first made at the last election , as he rejects the argument that such benefits are an ' unnecessary luxury ' in times of financial difficulties			1
instead , he said it is ' our fundamental duty ' to care for those who have ' done the right thing '			0
they deserve ' comfort , independence , companionship , health ' he said in a speech , adding : ' no one has put in as much as our elderly			0
these people have fought wars , seen us through recessions – made this the great country it is today			1
' they brought us into the world and cared for us , and now it 's our turn – our fundamental duty – to care for them			0
' last year mr @entity0 refused to say whether pensioner benefits would be continued for another five years , amid reports of opposition from within @entity47			0
it emerged at the time that senior ministers , including @entity51 and @entity52 had both argued for the guarantee to be dropped			0
both @entity54 and the @entity55 have called for restrictions on elements of some pensioner benefits for the better off			1
in 2010 , during the television debates , mr @entity0 rounded on @entity60 , accusing him of scaremongering by telling older people their benefits would be cut under the @entity64			0
today he said : ' in 2010 , i looked down the barrel of the camera and made a clear commitment to the @entity70 people that i would keep these things			1
' and that was n't a commitment for five years – it was a commitment for as long as i was prime minister			1
' i know some people do n't like this			0
there are those who say it 's an unnecessary luxury during a time of national financial difficulties			0
say that to the older woman who can keep warm tonight , on this cold february evening , because she 's been given the money to heat her home			0
' or the widower heading into town on the bus , doing his shopping , seeing people for the only time that week			2
or the bedbound lady whose whole day is brightened by the tv ; or the sick man whose pain is kept at bay			2
' @entity97 , independence , companionship , health – these are n't luxuries ; they 're what people who have worked and saved all their lives deserve			0
' and think what we would give up if we did take them away – the principle that if you 've done the right thing you will get the benefits of living in @entity70			0
' rejecting the argument that pensioner benefits need to be reduced to pay for cuts to the overall welfare bill , he will point out that the ' biggest saving ' made by the government has been as a result of raising the retirement age			2
he will also hint that @entity54 , which has said it will cut winter fuel payments for richer pensioners , could go further and restrict the benefits ' far more aggressively ' or even abolish them altogether			1
that suggestion will be furiously rejected by @entity54			2
the @entity128 costs around £ 2billion a year , the free tv licence for over- 75s £ 600million , free bus passes £ 1billion and free prescriptions and eye tests £ 4billion			1
@entity132 analysis suggests that @entity54 's policy of means - testing winter fuel payments will save just £ 75million after administration costs – or just 4 per cent of the budget for the benefit			1
that compares to @entity54 's estimate of £ 105million a year			1
enjoying the ride : @entity141 , 70 , and @entity142 , 67 , use their right to free travel on a @entity147 bus in this @entity148 the @entity55 have refused to countenance any further welfare reform unless mr @entity0 agrees to cuts to benefits for the better off			2
it is @entity55 policy to remove winter fuel payments and tv licences from higher rate tax paying pensioners but continue the pensioner bus pass , free prescriptions or eye tests for all			1
@entity55 pensions minister @entity162 said : ' the working age poor will pay the price for the conservative ring fence for the very wealthiest pensioners			2
@entity55 pensions minister @entity162 said : ' the working age poor will pay the price for the conservative ring fence for the very wealthiest pensioners ' ' the conservatives are proposing £ 12 billion pounds of welfare cuts which is the equivalent of a £ 1500 cut for eight million people			1
' by ruling out any changes to benefits of wealthy pensioners they are showing their determination to balance the books solely on the backs of disabled people and the working age poor			2
' mr @entity0 pledged last year to keep the ' triple lock ' , which guarantees the value of the £ 113 - a - week basic state pension , until at least 2020 if he wins the election			1
mr @entity0 said : ' the truth is this : the big savings will only come by restricting these benefits far more aggressively – or by abolishing these benefits altogether			0
' that 's why i have to warn people – beware of politicians promising just to cut one or two of these benefits , and only by a bit			0
once they have started chipping away at these benefits , believe me , before long , they 'll start getting rid of them altogether			0
' the announcement was welcomed by campaign groups representing older people			0
@entity204 , charity director at @entity205 , said : ' @entity205 supports the continuation of older people 's universal benefits because they are the best way we have of getting extra help to those who need it , and because older people tell us they value them highly			0
' @entity215 of @entity216 said : ' there appears to be much in today 's announcement that will appeal to the @entity216 generations			2
' @entity220 , @entity54 's shadow work and pensions secretary , said : ' @entity0 's government has let millions of pensioners down , failing to act on rising fuel costs and rip off pension fees and charges			1
' pensioners will find it hard to take pre-election promises seriously from a prime minister who has introduced the granny tax , increased @entity232 , and caused the @entity234 crisis which has damaged social care services			1
' @entity54 has a better plan for pensioners			1
we will support the triple lock , freeze energy bills and ensure savers are protected against pension rip - off pension charges and mis - selling			0
as part of our plan to get the deficit down in a fairer way , we will stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest five per cent of pensioners and reverse @entity0 's tax cut for millionaires			1
accusations that we will end pensioner benefits are simply untrue			0
