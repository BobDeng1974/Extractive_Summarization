by @entity0 a pub has opened in @entity3 offering pints of beer for as little as £ 1.50 - but insists that it does not encourage irresponsible drinking			1
the @entity6 in @entity7 , near @entity8 , is the second location in a chain of new public houses offering no - frills booze at extremely low prices			1
and - despite protests from some locals who prefer a pricier pint - the publican has insisted ' we do n't encourage people to get drunk '			1
barmaid @entity20 pulls a pint at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity3 ( left )			1
these four varieties cost just £ 1.50 for a pint ( right ) @entity24 , 31 , even says that the new budget drinking model could offer salvation for the @entity28 pub at a time when around 18 locals a week are closing across the country			1
his pub has been open for around two weeks , and follows the first @entity6 in @entity33 - on - @entity34 which opened last month			1
four types of @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 's - are on offer there at £ 1 for half a pint or £ 1.50 for a whole			1
the pub also offers bottles of @entity47 beer and fruit drink @entity46 for £ 1 , and pints of @entity50 and @entity51 for the same price			1
the location has an @entity55 - style logo and has the motto ' more round for your pound '			2
no - frills drinking : the @entity6 , formerly the @entity60 , offers four drinks at £ 1.50 a pint daytime : drinking at the @entity6 begins at 9am , which has prompted concerns from locals mr @entity24 says the opening has riled other pub owners because it dominates daytime drinking in the area , but says he has seen ' no trouble '			1
he said : ' at the end of the day , if you can only drink ten pints at £ 3 , you are still only going to be able to drink that if they ’re £ 1.50			1
' we do n’t encourage people to get drunk and there ’s been no more trouble			1
in fact the pub is already going very well and the customers seem to be happy			2
' the other pubs in the town are not so happy but that ’s not our fault			0
that ’s just because throughout the day we have the majority of customers in the town in here			0
' pubs around the country are shutting all the time so something has to be done - and this could be it			0
' mr @entity24 said his clients are mainly old men drinking throughout the day , starting as early as 9am			2
happy drinker : @entity98 , pictured , has been drinking at the establishment since before its transformation , and approves of the change he said the the pub was only met with one objection when its application for an extension to its alcohol licence was put forward last year			0
one daytime drinker said : ' people were expecting the street to be full of drunks but it ’s not because even though the beer is cheap it ’s still just passing trade			2
' if people get out of hand they get kicked out - it ’s like any other pub , only cheaper			2
' retired restaurant and factory worker @entity98 , 63 , has been frequenting the pub in its various guises since 1963 , when he says a pint was just 11 pence			0
he added : ' it ’s always been a good pub and it still is , especially now it ’s cheaper			0
they have a good landlord now who ’s very caring because when i fall asleep he always wakes me up and that goes a long way			0
' however , some residents of @entity7 have criticsed the @entity6 for taking advantage of ' vulnerable ' drinkers and lowering the tone of the town			1
basic : the pub saves money by not offering entertainment or subscribing to @entity139 busy : the pub 's landlord says that trade has been strong since the pub opened salesman @entity144 , 49 , drinks in the nearby @entity146 , for £ 3 a pint			1
he said : ' we do n’t want the £ 1 pub around here			1
there are already enough pound shops and they ’re rubbish too			0
all this bar is doing is selling cheap alcohol early in the morning to vulnerable people			0
' it ’s £ 3 a pint in here and i pay the extra because it ’s civilised and not full of vulnerable people			2
' rival pub landlady @entity160 , 44 , who runs the nearby @entity162 pub said she welcomed the pub for keeping ' bad people ' out of her establishment			2
she said : ' at least it keeps all the riff raff in one place			0
we are happy because it takes all the bad people out			0
every town should have a pound pub because it attracts all the ne’er - do - wells			0
' it used to be a cracking pub but it ’s been going down and down			0
' the local council has also raised fears that the pub will encourage ' irresponsible ' problem drinking and threaten public health			1
@entity184 ’s director of public health , professor @entity183 , said : ' alcohol used to be a luxury , but it is now widely available and often sold at pocket money prices			0
research has proved that the cheaper alcohol is , the more people drink			0
' any promotion which potentially increases the supply of cheap alcohol and which appears to target those on limited incomes , especially young adults , who are cost - conscious , is highly irresponsible - particularly in a borough like @entity8 which has high rates of alcohol harm			0
' hike : the average price of a pint of beer is £ 3.03 , a five per cent increase since 2012 the average price for a pint of beer in the @entity28 is £ 3.20 , but it varies depending on where you are in the country			2
according to the @entity215 , the average prices of a pint in different places are : @entity216 : £ 3.60 @entity217 : £ 3.24 @entity218 : £ 3.15 @entity3 : £ 3.00 @entity219 : £ 2.40 @entity220 : £ 3.52 @entity221 : £ 3.05 @entity222 : £ 3.30 other venues coach and @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity216 : £ 5.80 @entity227 , @entity228 : £ 3.30			1

location has opened in @entity7 , @entity3 , with pints for £ 1.50
chain also sells half pints , bottled beer , @entity236 and soft drinks for £ 1 each
but publican @entity24 insists they ' do n't encourage people to get drunk '
but residents and the council have attacked the pub for their low prices
