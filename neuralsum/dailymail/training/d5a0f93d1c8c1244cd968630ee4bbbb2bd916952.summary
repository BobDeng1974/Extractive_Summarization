by @entity0 it should have been a textbook landing – but a sudden gust of wind meant this little puffin ended up looking like @entity5 in mid-flight			1
the comical acrobatics of a colony of birds were captured by amateur photographer @entity10 on a blustery day on a remote @entity12 island			2
the birds ’ aerial dexterity was tested to the limit in the adverse weather conditions off @entity17 earlier this week			0
the puffin comes in to land on a rock on remote @entity12 island @entity17 when there is a sudden gust of wind with his wings frantically flapping in the air to stay above ground , eck the puffin resembles ski - jumper @entity29 the bird 's aerial dexterity was pushed to the limit on the blustery day in @entity17 frantically flapping their wings whilst being blown sideways , others appeared to almost nose dive to the ground			1
eventually they came to land on a grassy patch but had to keep flailing around to stop themselves being whirled away by the strong winds			0
yet it was the hilarious antics of this little chap , dubbed ‘ @entity42 ’ , that really caught the photographer ’s eye			0
eck the puffin desperate tries to make it to the rock edge in the extremely windy conditions eventually , @entity51 lands on the ground safely , shortly after another puffin who also braved the extreme weather mr @entity10 , 37 , from @entity56 , said : ‘ i was on @entity17 for six or seven days , just to see the puffins			2
' it was a wonderful experience , made all the more so thanks to this one bird as he attempted to land despite the windy weather			0
’ @entity61 became the first competitor to represent @entity63 in the @entity65 ski - jumping in 1988 – coming last			1
but last year he won @entity67 ’s celebrity diving competitio splash ! under the guidance of olympic medalist @entity69			0
even on firm ground , the puffins had trouble staying up right with @entity51 even resembling @entity75 sprinter @entity74 's lightning bolt pose the puffin 's antics have likened him to @entity61 , pictured , who became the first competitor to represent @entity63 in the @entity65 ski - jump in 1988 and came last			1
