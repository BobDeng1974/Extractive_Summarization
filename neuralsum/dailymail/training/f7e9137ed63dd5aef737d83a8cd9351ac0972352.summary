by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 01:50 est , 26 june 2013 @entity2 researchers have developed ‘ @entity7 ’ technology which stops those wearing the specs from seeing their face			1
the team have created their own pair of specs which have 11 leds on them which emit near infrared light into @entity15 ’ cameras			1
the light is not visible to the human eye , but on film it is so bright that you can not see the person ’s face			1
the glasses , which cost $ 1,500 a pair ( £ 980 ) , are currently on limited release to 2,000 people but will be more widely available later this year			1
they have caused concern because they have a camera next to the wearer ’s eye which can take photos or record video without a red light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working the ‘ @entity48 ’ technology currently only works on camera lenses which are sensitive to infrared light			1
the specs have 11 leds on them which emit near infrared light into @entity15 ' cameras the light is not visible to the human eye , but on film it is so bright that you can not see the person 's face but lead researcher professor @entity62 of the @entity63 in @entity2 said they were working on reflective materials which will have the same effect and be less obtrusive			1
he said : ‘ light from these near infrared @entity52 ca n’t be seen by the human eye , but when it passes through the camera ’s imaging device , it appears bright ’			2
in a video posted online by the @entity63 he also says that he developed the technology because he is especially worried about facial recognition software which has not yet been developed , but could soon come in the future			0
wearing sunglasses is not enough and will not stop your face from being detected as you can be identified using your nose as well as your eyes			2
a @entity15 porn app was banned instantly after @entity83 film producers said they wanted to use it to explore point - of - view shots			2
the glasses were developed by @entity63 in @entity2 and unveiled at a press event co-founder @entity88 wearing the glasses at @entity91 headquarters in in @entity92 earlier this year cafe owners in the @entity94 have banned it from their premises to respect the privacy of customers			0
and those wearing the technology could be banned from @entity94 strip clubs , cinemas and casinos because their owners do n’t want them filming there			0
lap dance clubs in @entity94 said that they would treat those wearing the @entity109 - connected specs the same as anyone caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out			0
@entity91 ’s chairman @entity115 once admitted that the aim with @entity15 was to ‘ go right up to the creepy line and not cross it ’			0
but the public clearly feels differently and in @entity120 those wearing @entity15 style specs have been subjected to ‘ cyber discrimination ’			0
@entity125 computer engineering professor @entity124 was at a @entity127 ’s restaurant in @entity128 when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head .			0

@entity2 researchers develop ' @entity7 ' technology
uses near infrared light to stop wearers from seeing their face
