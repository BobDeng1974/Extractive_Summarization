by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 a @entity4 man has been charged over a sickening crime where a cat 's blood was smeared on a garage door of a @entity10 home and a car set alight during an early morning attack			1
the 19 - year - old man will appear in @entity14 on wednesday charged with injuring animals by night , wilful damage and arson			1
it is alleged he killed a cat during the incident as well as setting a car on fire and damaging the garage door of the home			1
the owner of the cat that was slaughtered in the june 17 attack , @entity28 , told @entity29 she had no idea how @entity31 - a black and white feline - became entangled in the @entity34 crime			1
her owner , @entity28 , has described it as ' absolutely disgusting ' ms @entity28 said she had not noticed her cat was missing from her @entity43 home - about 10km away from the @entity45 address where the crime took place - until @entity10 police officers showed up at her door			1
' i knew of the threatening stuff from the news but i did n’t know it was my cat until the police came , ' the 20 - year - old said			1
' it did n’t feel real			0
i thought i had seen her that day , but i had been unwell that day and the day before so i was unsure when i had last seen her			0
' i was asleep when i suspected she was taken by one of my friends , which would have been monday night			2
' a message was left on a garage door at a @entity10 home in the early hours of last tuesday while a resident 's car was set on fire ' i never expected someone to do this to me and for no apparent reason to me			1
it was n’t a threat to me			0
' pretty much it was my cat being at the wrong place at the wrong time			2
' ms @entity28 's other cat , @entity79 , is also mourning the loss of his playmate			1
' they used to hide together and play together – they were always together , ' ms @entity28 said			1
the cat 's head was left on the front door of the @entity34 home on @entity45 in @entity88 the moment when the crime happened was captured on a fixed cctv camera across the road and emerged last wednesday			1
despite it 's poor quality and a lack of light , the video manages to show at least two people loitering at the front of a garage door presumably scribbling the message : ' @entity102 ( sic ) my money ? @entity105 ! ' in cat 's blood			1
the silhouetted figures make it difficult to pinpoint exactly how many people are in the footage , but police have previously confirmed it was more than one			0
the culprits can then be seen moving towards the car holding a flame fueled by an accelerant , before throwing it inside			0
the car is quickly engulfed in flames before the footage ends with it still burning			0
in the rear of the image , at least two people can be spotted loitering in front of the garage door where it is presumed a message is being scrawled in cat 's blood			1
the silhouettes are lit up by the flame which is later used to throw into the car parked right to the right of the screen a @entity88 police spokesperson told @entity29 last week the pivotal moments of the film were at 2.17am and 2.19am in real time where the footage starts and car was set alight			2
' at 2.17am you can clearly see people in front of the double garage door , and to the right you can see the small black square which is the car later set set alight , ' the spokesperson said			2
detectives described the grisly slaughter of the cat , and the message which it was used to write , as ' abhorrent			2
' the @entity151 also offered a $ 5000 reward to anyone who had information that led to an arrest			0
during initial investigations , a 19 - year - old man was taken into police custody but was released without charge			1
a @entity161 spokeswoman said the man charged on tuesday was not the same one			2
' there have been a number of people questioned by police since the event occurred as part of the investigations , ' she said			0
a burst of bright light fills the screen the moment the flame is thrown at the car senior sergeant @entity175 from @entity176 told @entity177 last week the incident was likely to be an ongoing matter with the occupants			0
' it 's not a random act , the home was targeted specifically , ' he said			2
the cat had been ' decapitated and otherwise dismembered ' , senior sergeant @entity175 said			0
residents and neighbours were woken by a loud explosion at 2.45am and police found the severely mutilated cat near the burning vehicle			0
the cat 's head was left at the front door of the house			1
people thought to be the homeowners were seen cleaning the graffiti off the garage door later on tuesday morning			0
detective acting inspector @entity200 said the occupants were disturbed by the message			0
but he would not say whether they had an idea who was responsible or if there were likely to be organised crime links			0
