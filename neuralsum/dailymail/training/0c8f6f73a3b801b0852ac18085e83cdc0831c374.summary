secretary of state @entity0 asked @entity1 on tuesday for new war powers in the fight against the @entity4 , but said lawmakers should not limit @entity7 military action to @entity8 and @entity9 or prevent president @entity10 from deploying ground troops if he later deems them necessary			1
' the president has been crystal clear that his policy is that @entity7 military forces will not be deployed to conduct ground combat operations against @entity17 , ' @entity0 told a @entity19 committee , using the administration 's preferred name for the terrorist group			1
' it does n’t mean that we should pre-emptively bind the hands of the commander in chief or our commanders in the field in responding to scenarios and contingencies that are impossible to foresee , ' he said			1
the @entity50 said on wednesday that there is actually one instance in which the president already did ' commit ground troops ... in a combat role in @entity9			2
' over the summer @entity10 ordered a rescue mission of @entity7 hostages , and that included boots on the ground , the president 's spokesman , @entity55 , said			1
if @entity1 were to ban ' the use of combat troops , the president 's hands would be tied , and he would n't be able to order a mission like that ' in the future , @entity55 claimed			1
' and that is what we 're seeking to avoid , ' he said			0
further explaining the administration 's request , @entity55 said , ' it 's impossible for us to imagine all of the contingencies that could occur			1
' ' the president 's been very clear that he does not envision a scenario where he is going to commit substantial @entity7 ground troops in a combat role in @entity8 or in @entity9 , ' he said			2
in the battle against the @entity82 militants , @entity10 has been relying on congressional authorizations that former president @entity84 used to justify military action after 9/11			0
the commander in chief has insisted that he had the legal authority to send about 3,000 @entity7 troops to train and assist @entity8 security forces , and launch hundreds of airstrikes against targets in @entity8 and @entity9 since september			1
critics say the @entity50 's use of post- 9/11 congressional authorizations is a legal stretch at best , however , and @entity0 on tuesday appeared before the @entity33 to tell lawmakers what sort of war powers the administration would like to see lawmakers include in a new @entity101			1
the @entity50 is now backing the creation of a new @entity103 limited to the current military campaign that would , as @entity55 said today , ' move the @entity7 away from a permanent war			1
' sen. @entity106 , a @entity107 and the the outgoing chairman of the @entity33 , joined legislators from both sides of the aisle in lamenting that if the @entity50 wants a new @entity103 , it should have sent suggested language to @entity1 months ago			1
nevertheless , the @entity115 senator said that , ' @entity1 , rather than the executive , has the responsibility and the authority to authorize military action and to declare war , ' and it should not accede that power to the president by doing nothing at all			2
' we are the check and balance on executive power , regardless of who that executive is			0
and if we abandon that role , then we will have done a grave disservice to the @entity7 people , ' he said			0
similarly , his @entity135 colleague @entity134 of @entity136 said @entity1 ought to pass new authorization immediately			0
@entity134 said he does n't want @entity1 to go home for the holidays while there are @entity7 service men and women fighting overseas and risking their lives without putting their imprint on the conflict			2
' we are at war , ' @entity134 said			0
' @entity1 has been silent about this			0
' @entity148 protesters held up anti-war placards as @entity0 testified before the committee			0
the @entity10 administration officials asked @entity1 on tuesday to grant the president the authority to put boots on the ground in the fight against @entity17 if necessary @entity106 said he would call for a committee vote on a new authorization later this week			1
yet few expect that @entity1 will approve new war powers before the end of the lame - duck session this year			1
the legislature is scheduled to recess for the holidays on friday and will not resume activities until the first full week in january , when @entity166 will take control both the @entity19 and the @entity50			1
' whatever passes out of committee this week is not going to become law , ' @entity168 sen. @entity168 , the incoming chairman of the committee , said on tuesday , recognizing the time constraints			0
he said the committee also wants to hear from intelligence and defense officials before its makes a decision			0
@entity0 said the administration believes a proposal drafted by @entity106 is a good starting point , but that the administration seeks some important changes			0
generally , @entity0 said the administration is seeking an authorization that does not include a geographical limitation			0
' we do n't anticipate conducting operations in countries other than @entity8 and @entity9 , but to the extent that @entity17 poses a threat to @entity7 interests and personnel in other countries , we would not want an @entity103 to constrain our ability to use appropriate force against @entity17 in those locations if necessary , ' he said			2
the secretary of state said ' it would be a mistake to advertise to ' the @entity4 militants that they have safe haven outside those countries			0
however , @entity202 sen. @entity201 , a probable @entity166 presidential candidate , said he could not vote for any authorization that did not have geographic restrictions			0
' that is a very scary and very wrong - headed message to be sending to the @entity207 , ' the libertarian lawmaker said			0
' you are sending a message to the @entity207 that no city is off limits			0
' @entity201 has proposed legislation of his own to the @entity19 that would formally declare war on @entity17 and give the @entity10 administration the authority to put @entity7 troops in combat in ' limited operations			1
' the one - year resolution would terminate a 2002 @entity103 the @entity10 administration has been deriving its authority to attack @entity17 from and introduce a one - year sunset into the other			2
@entity0 said tuesday that the confrontation against @entity17 will not be over quickly , however , and that while the administration does not seek an open - ended authorization , it wants it to include a provision that would allow for it to be extended			2
@entity0 debated back and forth with senators from both parties about the differences between what @entity1 is proposing for the @entity103 and what the @entity230 wants			2
senators told @entity0 that the administration should have come to @entity1 with its list of demands months ago @entity106 's resolution would limit operations to three years and allow ground forces in some circumstances			1
it also would compel @entity10 to provide @entity1 with a comprehensive strategy and repeal the @entity84 administration 's 2002 @entity8 war authorization			1
@entity0 said the administration would agree that any new authorization would supersede the 2002 authorization			0
moreover , @entity0 said the administration wants to make sure that any authorization does not too narrowly define militants found alongside @entity17 because it would , for example , make it difficult for the @entity7 military officials on the ground to identify enemy forces			1
@entity254 sen. @entity253 , a strong critic of @entity10 's foreign policy in @entity8 and @entity9 , called the hearing a ' kind of charade ' because the authorization was not expected to become law before the new @entity1 starts in january			1
he said @entity10 needs to present a draft authorization to @entity1 in january			2
' he should lead and tell us what that authorization should be , ' @entity253 said			0
@entity253 further criticized the @entity10 administration for not giving the @entity9 opposition the military equipment and weapons it needs to fight against @entity9 president @entity269 who is ' slaughtering ' his people .			0

@entity10 has stated on multiple occasions that he would not allow @entity7 forces to join combat missions against @entity17 , for any reason
@entity0 told a @entity19 committee on tuesday , ' it does n’t mean that we should pre-emptively bind the hands of the commander in chief '
commanders in the field sometimes have to respond ' to scenarios and contingencies that are impossible to foresee , ' he added
the @entity50 said wednesday : ' it 's impossible for us to imagine all of the contingencies that could occur '
even if the @entity33 were to agree to new war powers , the full @entity19 and the @entity50 would have to approve the bill
@entity1 is scheduled to recess on friday and will not return until january
