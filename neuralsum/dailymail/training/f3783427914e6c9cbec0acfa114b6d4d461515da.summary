it is four months since @entity1 sunk his teeth into @entity3 and absented himself from football for his brief sabbatical			2
on saturday evening at the @entity6 he re-emerged and time away had not withered him nor has psychiatric counselling dimmed his spirit			2
but good though he is , he can not yet conjure miracles			0
he may have added intensity , ferocity and guile to an already - formidable @entity15 attack – but as a collective unit on saturday night they did not have the tools to stop @entity19 and co. the world ’s most richly - decorated football match , which even in the absence of the injured @entity24 , still boasts a comfortable majority of the world ’s top ten footballers , produced a spell - binding match of attacking intent which further suggests the balance of power in football ’s universe in tilting in favour of @entity34 and @entity19 at present			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity1 is tackled during a frustrating @entity36 for @entity15 's new striker as @entity34 win at the @entity39 on saturday evening @entity19 celebrates scoring during the @entity36 clash between @entity34 and @entity15 on saturday evening @entity41 ( right ) looks frustrated during the @entity36 match as @entity34 's @entity19 ( left ) beat his @entity15 opponent on saturday @entity41 struggled in the match and failed to score this chance against @entity34 goalkeeper @entity46 on saturday evening at the @entity39 @entity41 could n't get a goal past @entity34 goalkeeper @entity46 but his counterpart @entity19 managed to score from the penalty spot @entity34 were welcomed to the match by a huge crowd of fans outside the @entity39 ahead of their win over rivals @entity15 @entity34 : @entity46 7 , @entity56 7 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 7 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 7 , @entity61 7 ( @entity62 , 89 ) , @entity63 8 ( @entity64 , 83 ) , @entity65 7 , @entity19 7 , @entity66 8 ( @entity67 , 86 ) subs ( not used ) : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 bookings : @entity56 , @entity19 goals : @entity58 ( 51 ) , @entity19 ( @entity75 , 35 ) @entity66 ( 61 ) @entity15 : @entity76 7 ; @entity77 7 , @entity78 7 , @entity79 6 , @entity80 6 ; @entity81 6 ( @entity82 , 60 ) , @entity83 6 , @entity84 6 ( @entity85 , 71 ) ; @entity41 6 , @entity1 8 ( @entity86 , 69 ) , @entity87 8 subs ( not used ) : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 bookings : @entity41 , @entity87 , @entity78 , @entity84 goals : @entity87 ( 4 ) ratings by @entity96 @entity66 , scorer of the third goal , left the pitch to a standing ovation having led the way to a comprehensive victory which might have been more embarrassing for @entity15			1
of course , @entity19 was a key contributor , as was @entity63 while @entity61 and @entity60 meanwhile were simply magnificently neatly efficient at the base of midfield			1
and while @entity1 shone whilst his fitness allowed , @entity41 and @entity87 flickered only in moments , @entity81 looked a 34 - year - old short of game time and @entity84 made a rare , awful error to gift real their third			1
indeed , when even with the game effectively over and the celebrations in full swings the @entity39 groaned angrily at @entity59 for failing to play in @entity19 for a fourth goal , @entity34 ’s dominance was clear			1
the game might be won but the crowd wanted more ; they wanted humiliation			0
they contended themselves with a chorus of ‘ @entity124			0
’ it was not a night for @entity127 pride			0
they will comfort themselves that they do at least have @entity1			0
he was excellent , given the time he has been away			0
‘ i ’m happy to be back playing , ’ he said afterwards			0
‘ it ’s a big relief and i ’m happy that the time has passed			0
it ’s a bittersweet feeling because of the result but this side has come back many a time			0
‘ it is very difficult to play here but i did the things that i could			0
everyone knows how clasicos are played , the first few minutes are hard , but football is like that			2
they played well on the counter after we went ahead and they killed the game			0
’ after a tumultuous opening , @entity34 did indeed kill the game			1
the ‘ @entity151 ’ banner celebrating @entity34 ’s ten @entity153 had barely been put away , the music had only just died down , when the tiny knot of @entity15 fans were celebrating in the far corner of the @entity39 inside three minutes			1
the goal sparked a frenetic response from @entity34			2
‘ i was surprised at the level at which we could play so soon after the @entity163 game , ’ said a satisfied @entity159			0
‘ this is a serious team and they sacrifice themselves for each other			0
’ indeed , this side is much more than a collection of galaticos ; @entity171 has created a balance that is truly impressive			0
even @entity41 , cowed on the night , seemed unnerved , crashing into @entity60 early on and earning a yellow card , the first of four @entity15 would accumulate in that first half			1
@entity19 was at the heart of @entity34 ’s early best efforts , crossing on 11 minutes for @entity66 , whose header crashed off the bar and whose strike from rebound blazed over			1
the game was infused with attacking talent , but the finishing did n’t always match			0
@entity1 sent in a delicious cross and @entity41 , from six yards out , missed			0
@entity87 , similarly , mis - kicked from four yards out			1
@entity87 gave @entity15 the lead after just four minutes with @entity1 providing the assist at the @entity39 @entity87 and @entity41 celebrate @entity15 taking the lead against @entity34 at the @entity39 on saturday evening @entity15 held the lead until the 35th minute after @entity87 's early goal in the @entity36 tie against @entity34 @entity87 celebrates his goal against @entity34 but @entity15 could not hold on to their lead in the @entity195 clash @entity19 looks frustrated after @entity34 go 1 - 0 down but the former @entity198 player soon got his own goal @entity34 had to re-establish their grip on the game and they did so through right back @entity59 driving into the penalty area on 34 minutes			1
his cross induced @entity78 to collapse to the ground and handle the ball			2
the penalty was inevitable as was the finish from @entity19 : a crisp , unstoppable striker into the bottom right hand corner , his 16th this season in @entity195 and we ’re not even out of october			1
@entity15 had n’t conceded in the league this season , a record always unlikely to survive this outing and after the break @entity34 were re-invigorated , flying forward on the counter attack on 47 minutes as @entity66 released @entity19 , with @entity78 sliding in to block for the corner			1
@entity60 trotted away to take the kick with precision that was signposted for @entity58 at the far post			2
the @entity223 connected , heading the ball firmly into the bottom corner and the @entity39 was itself again , full of noise and confidence			2
@entity19 takes his penalty in the 35th minute to bring @entity34 level in the @entity36 tie against @entity15 on saturday @entity19 celebrates in typical style at the @entity39 as the former @entity198 star equalises against @entity15 @entity19 goes to his usual celebration after scoring against @entity15 to bring the teams level before half - time on saturday evening @entity15 did not immediately retreat			1
@entity57 needed a crucial sliding clearance to prevent @entity41 from connecting with a pull back and @entity80 hit a remarkable strike from 35 yards which @entity46 dived to save spectacularly			0
but the flow of the game was with @entity171 ’s men			0
@entity15 were creaking and @entity84 as good as confirmed the fact with an uncharacteristic lazy touch on the hour which allowed @entity63 to break and feed @entity19 , who played in @entity246			1
the @entity247 touched the ball on to @entity66 , who finished quite splendidly , pulling his shot across goal and past @entity76			2
@entity15 ’s suddenly appeared terribly brittle			2
@entity79 ’s fine sliding challenge prevented @entity19 adding to the scoring on 65 minutes			1
@entity77 needed to do the same again , leaving the world player of the year in complaining , crumpled heap			0
@entity1 departed on 68 minutes : he had run his course , done his best but ultimately in vain			2
he will come again , but @entity15 ’s unbeaten record in @entity195 is over and their superiority complex severely punctured			1
@entity34 players react after @entity58 gave them the lead against @entity15 on saturday evening at the @entity39 @entity58 ( right ) was able to gift @entity34 an important lead against @entity15 in the @entity36 showdown on saturday @entity66 gives @entity34 a 3 - 1 lead at the @entity39 by slotting home beyond @entity15 goalkeeper @entity76 @entity34 's @entity19 and @entity66 celebrate sealing the @entity36 win at the @entity39 in front of their own fans against @entity15 @entity269 shows @entity195 as part of an unrivalled autumn of sport that includes @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity276 tennis , @entity277 and @entity279 @entity278			1

@entity87 gave @entity15 the lead after just four minutes at the @entity39 against @entity195 rivals @entity34
@entity19 equalised with a penalty in the 35th minute after a *handball* in the box by @entity78
@entity58 gave @entity34 the lead in the 51st minute before @entity66 made it 3 - 1 later in the second half
