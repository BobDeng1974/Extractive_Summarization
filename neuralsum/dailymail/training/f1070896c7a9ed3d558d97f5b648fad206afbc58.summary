by @entity1 reporter published : 07:08 est , 5 may 2012 updated : 08:30 est , 5 may 2012 a ' mobile response ' team of @entity5 officers intended to ease airport congestion is sleeping on night shifts , strolling around @entity9 's shops and drinking coffee , according to leaked emails			2
one officer was told to ' get his head down ' on a night shift and has described spending his time shuttling between terminals rather than dealing with passenger queues			1
he said caustically he failed to see the advantage of staff ' happily relaxing on a scenic bus ride around the airport ' while colleagues were in need of help elsewhere in the airport			2
long wait : passengers vented their fury at being stuck in queues at @entity9 's passport control ( file photo ) paralysis : the head of the @entity34 's @entity5 @entity33 was asked how he would react if there were four - hour queues during the @entity37			1
he replied : ' so be it ' the insight has raised fears that plans to install more mobile squads to ease the now - notorious delays at passport control could prove to have little impact			2
according to emails seen by the @entity47 , rather than helping with the politically and economically damaging queues , the anonymous officer tells of aimless wandering around @entity9 when working with the mobile team			1
he writes : ' as to the night shift itself , we started at 21:00 hrs & spent until 22:30 strolling around the airport , drinking coffee & trying on @entity58 sunglasses in the duty free shopping area			2
' he added : ' from 23:30 i was told to " get my head down somewhere " until 4:30 ish			2
' the paper said the emails revealed that teams - of which there are reportedly 16 mobile teams of ten - were rarely sent in time during the day , thereby missing congestion in some cases because of the distance between airport buildings			0
last weekend the officer worked at @entity73 , and told how he spent a couple of hours reading a magazine			0
on a previous occasion on duty at the same terminal , the @entity47 said he had ' no passengers whatsoever ' for nearly an hour , while @entity80 was , he said , ' heaving '			1
a @entity5 spokesperson said : ' these claims misrepresent the effectiveness of using mobile teams who can move around the airport to meet demand			1
caustic : the unnamed @entity5 official wrote that he was spending time ' happily relaxing on a scenic bus ride around the airport ' , rather than helping colleagues ' this approach is sensible planning and is just one way to deliver a secure border that has the right numbers of staff at the rights times , meaning that the vast majority of passengers pass through immigration controls quickly			1
' the claims came as it was revealed passengers at @entity106 faced ' unacceptably long ' immigration queues at the beginning of the @entity109 weekend			1
hundreds of disgruntled passengers were delayed for up to two hours at passport control at the @entity112 airport yesterday evening			1
a spokesman for @entity106 said action was needed to address the issue of long waits urgently			1
visit : immigration minister @entity117 during a visit to @entity73 of @entity119 he said : ' the majority of passengers arriving at @entity106 pass through border controls quickly and securely			1
however , at peak times , and similar to many other @entity34 airports , immigration queues can be unacceptably long			1
' we recognise that maintaining strong border security is a priority but we also want to see sufficient resources available to meet passenger demand and keep delays to a minimum at the busiest times			0
' our customer service teams work closely with the @entity5 to help manage queues and assist passengers at peak times but we believe further action is needed to address the issue as a matter of urgency			1
' one passenger told the @entity143 she waited for two hours at passport control , another said after a flight from @entity147 she waited so long they were put into another area			2
a @entity5 spokesman said : ' we flexibly deploy staff to meet demand , meaning that the vast majority of passengers pass through immigration controls quickly			2
' we will not compromise border security but work closely with airport operators to keep delays to a minimum			0
' the government has announced it is planning to draft in 80 extra staff in the wake of criticism of the lengthy delays			0
immigration minister @entity117 has admitted the @entity5 needs to change the way it operates and said the extra staff would start work this month			0
ministers have already been warned they face a ‘ summer of chaos ’ caused by long queues at passport control due to a huge influx of visitors for the @entity37 and the @entity176 celebrations			1
airlines and airport bosses have criticised the queues and unions have complained that staff cuts are causing delays			2
ministers are to draft in more than 550 volunteers in a desperate bid to avoid chaos at border posts during the @entity37			0
the volunteers will receive just four days of training on how to operate passport controls at ports and airports , according to the @entity193			0
positions will be filled by staff from @entity199 , retired immigration officers and those who have taken voluntary redundancy			0
the plan had been limited to @entity202 airports but in a sign that ministers are keen to avoid embarrassing delays it has been extended to @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity34 controls in @entity211			0
it was announced this week that immigration staff are to stage a one - day strike in the bitter dispute over public sector pensions , threatening huge disruption at airports including @entity9			0
the @entity219 ( @entity220 ) , which represents 4,500 @entity222 staff , said its members will walk out next thursday at ports and airports across the @entity34 and abroad			0
and figures released this week revealed that air passengers have been forced to queue at immigration for twice as long as ministers previously suggested			1
news that travellers were delayed for up to 3 hours at immigration - double the length of time the government had estimated – comes as it emerged the @entity5 failed to meet its @entity9 passport control targets on an almost daily basis			0
fresh evidence of the true extent of the @entity9 passport control fiasco was presented to home secretary @entity240 as she met on thursday with airline bosses seeking a solution to the predicted ' summer of chaos '			0
the queue figures were produced by @entity9 operator @entity245 which says its statistics are more detailed , accurate and robust than those compiled for the @entity248 by the @entity5 .			0

claims come as @entity106 passengers faced ' unacceptably long ' queues
