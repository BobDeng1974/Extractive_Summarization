by @entity1 reporter last updated at 5:36 pm on 7th july 2011 a bride - to - be is staging a sit - in at her village church after her dream of walking down the aisle just like her mother , grandmother and great - great grandmother was shattered when the church announced it was to close			1
@entity11 , 21 , dreamed of being the fourth generation of her family to have a white wedding in the picturesque @entity16 church			1

' protest : @entity11 , pictured with grandmother @entity21 , is staging a sit - in at @entity23 in @entity24 after the village church closed , dashing her hopes of becoming fourth generation of her family to walk down the aisle now she is one of more than 50 villagers mounting an around - the - clock vigil at @entity23 to keep it open for her marriage ceremony			1
tearful @entity11 said : ' i used to sit in the congregation and look around imagining the day when i would be floating up the aisle			2
every little girl dreams about her wedding day			2
' my great - great grandmother was married here in 1923 and i was desperate to carry on that tradition just like my mother and grandmother did			2
' i was christened here and have been coming to the church all of my life			1
' heartbreaking : ' i could picture every detail of my wedding			2
but now that has been taken from me ' , says @entity11 ' i could picture every detail of my wedding			0
but now that has been taken from me at the last moment - it is heartbreaking			0
' @entity11 had booked her big day six months ago at the 126 - year - old @entity23 in @entity49 , @entity24 in @entity50			1
she always treasured the family album of pictures showing generations of her family smiling outside the church gates			1
their wedding picture album shows her late great - great grandmother @entity59 in 1923 , grandmother @entity21 , 61 , in 1969 and mum @entity60 , 41 , in 1988			0
but officials decided the church - opened in 1885 in memory of a mining disaster which killed 81 men - would close because it needs ' hundreds of thousands of pounds ' in repairs			1
@entity11 was told by the vicar @entity68 just weeks ago that the church was due to close - even though it was booked for her september wedding			1
she said : ' all my dreams were shattered			0
' my grandmother lives across the road from the church			1
i had planned to walk across to the ceremony in my wedding dress just like my @entity78 and @entity79 had done before me			0
' i burst into tears thinking that 's never going to happen			0
' but the battling bride - to - be is not giving up on her dream wedding			0
since the last service on sunday , @entity11 and other regulars in the congregation organised a sit - in to keep the church open			1
at least four sleep on the church floor at night - and during the day the church is busy with people bringing supplies and signing the protest book			1
@entity11 is hoping church authorities will have a change of heart so she can marry driver fiancé @entity98 , 23 , on 17 september			1
second generation : @entity11 's grandmother , @entity21 , got married in @entity23 in 1969 if not she will have to book another village church more than five miles away - but it is half the size of @entity23			1
she said : ' some of our guests may have to stand outside			0
i 'll have to book a car to get me back and from the church too			1
' the local choir was booked to sing as i came into the church			1
i do n't suppose there 'll be room for them			0
' @entity11 's grandmother @entity21 is also in the sit - in - and wept as she talked about the family 's disappointment			0
family tradition : @entity11 's mother @entity60 was married at the @entity23 in @entity49 in april 1988 , while her great - grandmother @entity59 was married there in 1923 @entity21 said : ' i have always wanted to see @entity11 married here			0
' as the wedding drew nearer we 've all had butterflies in our stomachs			0
' now all that is gone			0
it is tragic and we want our church kept open			2
' @entity126 , 67 , one of the organisers of the sit - in , said : ' we want the @entity129 to sit up and see how strongly people feel about this			0
' everyone in the community is supporting us			0
the local chip shop is even giving free fish suppers to the protesters sleeping overnight here			1
' the @entity129 decided the church needed major repairs costing an estimated £ 400,000 and was becoming ' too dangerous ' to keep open			2
archbishop of @entity141 dr @entity140 said : ' nobody wants to see a church closed and my prayers are with members of @entity23			2
' it is simply a matter of practicality and pooling our resources together			0

*dilapidated* @entity24 church is to close through lack of funds
@entity157 would have been fourth generation to marry in church
50 villagers have *joined* the vigil with local chip shop supplying food
