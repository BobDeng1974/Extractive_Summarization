by @entity0 last updated at 9:50 pm on 13th february 2012 legal high : @entity2 was linked to two deaths in @entity4 at the weekend a new legal high billed as a safe alternative to ketamine is flooding on to @entity10 's streets , a charity has said			1
@entity2 - which can easily be bought online - has seen a surge in popularity in @entity10 and across northern @entity13 in recent months			1
the drug , also known as @entity2 or mexxy , is described as having the same effect as ketamine without the side effects			1
however , police are linking it to the deaths of a 59 - year - old woman and a 32 - year - old man in @entity24 and @entity25 over the weekend			1
it is believed to be the first time the new high has been linked to fatalities in @entity10			2
detective inspector @entity30 , of @entity31 , said : ' we are investigating the circumstances leading to the deaths of these two people in order to prepare files for the coroner			2
' one of our lines of inquiry is that prior to their deaths both people may have taken a form of the drug ketamine , known medically as methoxetamine , which may have been purchased over the internet			1
' party drug : @entity2 has been billed as a safe alternative to ketamine - although there is no evidence the claims are true however , @entity2 has become popular because unlike ketamine it is claimed it does not cause severe bladder cramps			1
@entity2 is just the latest legal high to appear on @entity10 's streets			1
many of the concoctions are dangerous - but because the authorities know so little about them they can be taken without fear of prosecution			0
the number of legal highs on sale hit 40 last year , up from just 13 in 2008			0
doctors believe that these drugs could lead to psychosis , liver damage and even death — warnings which are going unheeded by ­ consumers , and the government			0
as these drugs are legal , it means premium prices - and profits			0
for instance , a small packet of @entity78 - a herbal marijuana substitute - costs £ 30 , more than four times the price of the same amount of marijuana			2
however , far from being a benign , risk - free way of taking drugs , the growing army of @entity10 users are risking their lives by ingesting potentially lethal ­ cocktails of chemicals , often concocted by corrupt pharmacists working in @entity93 and @entity94			0
the legal high @entity95 - or meow meow - was banned in 2010 after being linked to up to 100 deaths			0
however , it was rapidly replaced by @entity99			0
@entity100 is another popular ' legal high ' which is yet to be banned			0
also , as ketamine is an illegal @entity106 drug , anyone taking the legal high is not at risk of prosecution			2
but despite claims that @entity2 is ' safer ' than the illegal alternative there is no evidence that it is true - and experts say that it can cause mental health problems			1
it is sold online as plant feeder or bath salt in the same way as mephedrone was before it was banned			2
it is marked as ' not fit for human consumption '			1
the authors of a @entity125 2011 report wrote : ' as with the former legal high drug mephedrone , which mimicked ecstasy and cocaine , ketamine now has its legal doppelganger – in the form of @entity2 ( @entity2 )			1
' the drug is sometimes advertised online as a " bladder - friendly " ketamine substitute , has similar effects to its illegal counterpart and according to one expert has " an expanding fan - base "			2
' the drug is sold online for around £ 17 per gram			1
the line between illegal and legal recreational drugs has become blurred in recent years with a number of legal substitutes flooding the market			0
@entity145 , a researcher for the @entity146 , told the @entity146 : ' the new kid on the block seems to be methoxetamine			0
' it is growing in popularity , not just in the @entity10 but in northern @entity13			0
it 's so similar in chemical structure to ketamine there is no evidence to suggest that it does n't carry the same risks , or that it is bladder - friendly ' .			0

@entity2 may have killed two people at the weekend , police say
it is sold as ' not fit for human consumption '
drug can be easily purchased online for £ 17 per gram
