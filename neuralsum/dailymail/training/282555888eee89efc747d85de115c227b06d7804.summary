body image , bullying on social media , healthy eating , the destructive effects of the internet - these are all things at the foremost of any mother 's mind as their daughter starts to grow up			1
and being a celebrity does n't make it any easier - as @entity12 , mother to daughter @entity13 , now four , is finding out			1
whether it 's how much time to allow a child to use an @entity16 , stopping your child from being bullied , or making sure they always feel good about their body , she is kept up at night worrying just as much as the next parent			1
since having her daughter @entity13 , now four , she has become increasingly aware of how the world has changed in a generation , with the internet and body image both having a huge effect on the behaviour of young girls one of the tv star 's biggest concerns so far is how to keep her daughter unaware of the airbrushing , diet - crazed , size - zero world that young women are subjected to , for as long as possible			1
and one of her golden rules is never , ever talking about dieting or weight in front of @entity13			1
she said : ' my mum never talked about dieting in front of me and i get so cross when i see my friends do it in front of their kids			2
' they do n’t realise they ’re doing it , but they ’ll eat something and then i ’ll see them say in front of their daughter or son , " oh , i should n’t have done that , i feel so fat now			1
" ' kids pick up on that and they start to wonder if they will feel fat if they eat it , or whether they are fat			0
' i did n’t even know what a diet was until i was into my late teens , which was great and i know that as a result , i have a really healthy attitude to eating			2
' it 's fine to talk about that kind of thing with your girlfriends , but never in front of their kids			1
' since her early twenties , @entity12 has grown up in the spotlight			1
@entity12 , pictured here with @entity82 , has been in the public eye since she was 23 years old after becoming famous as a presenter on one of the @entity88 's most successful tv shows of the nineties - @entity90 - the 40 - year - old has rarely been out of the public eye			1
as a result , every aspect of her personal life been picked over in minute detail for the last 17 years			2
it means that unlike most women her age , she tries to keep away from social media as much as possible , apart from a @entity101 account , which is largely for work purposes			0
it is an attitude that she is hoping will rub off on her daughter , especially in the age of online trolls , which has resulted in several @entity88 children taking their lives after being targeted by bullies on social networking sites			1
@entity12 said : ' you just have to try and monitor it as best you can			1
' educate the best you can from an early age about the dangers of what you can find on the internet , not to be trusting and just explain that the people on these sites are only a virtual friend			2
' i had a very weird situation recently where i had a big group of girlfriends who i ’ve known for years get together for my 40th birthday			0
denise in 1997 , when she was just 23 years old ' it was funny because some of my mates who hardly know each other and have only met a couple of times were sitting there saying , “ this is so weird being with you in person because i feel like i know everything about your life and yet i ’ve probably met you twice in ten years			2
” ' these women are virtual friends			0
' i ’m not really in that world , i tweet but i ’m not on @entity140 , i ’m so old school - i want to speak to my friends properly			0
' i would much rather wait six weeks and have a phone call or go for a coffee than to get a virtual message every two weeks , because you need your friends and that proper support			0
' but the internet is n't the only technological concern , @entity12 also shares the worry of millions of parents across the western world about how much time their children are spending staring at screens			1
it 's the daily dilemma of a busy single mum - how much can you allow your child to watch television or use an @entity16 , while also needing a tool to distract them as you get on with certain household chores			1
@entity12 said : ' you do n’t want your kids to grow up too quickly , i have an @entity16 that has a lot of apps on it for my daughter and we spend a lot of time travelling in the car , so she uses it sometimes then			1
' but i ’m really quite strict about not spending too much time on the @entity16 , i play quite a lot of traditional games with her like ' @entity178 ' , or the first person to spot ten red cars can have a smartie			1
' i ’m really conscious of the fact that when i was younger i did a lot of travelling in the car with my parents and i was always encouraged to use my imagination a lot			0
' i also think that conversing is important , it ’s an easy way out for parents to sometimes just stick an @entity190 or @entity16 in front of my kids			1
' i do it , do n’t get me wrong , by i limit the amount of time that i let her do it			0
' but at the same time , you do n’t want them to get left behind , because in schools , that is how they ’re learning everything - on a touch screen			0
' a life for @entity13 away from computers and televisions , running around outside with friends and playing on bikes - much like @entity12 's own childhood - is what spurred her to buy a family home in the @entity212 countryside a few years ago			1
@entity12 at @entity213 in 2001 - she believes that a lot has changed in the showbiz industry since then she said : ' i moved out of @entity216 for that reason			1
' i grew up in @entity219 , it was quite built up and residential where i lived but my parents ’ house looked over a field			2
' we ’d go out run around in the fields in our tracksuits and climb trees - that ’s why i took my daughter out of @entity216 , i wanted her to have an outdoors upbringing			0
' i love it when we just stick our wellies on and go and explore			0
' i never had a sporty upbringing , partly because i went to theatre school , so my focus was on acting and singing			0
' but i really hope @entity13 gets involved in team sports			2
' i ’ve recently taken up golf and i take her to the putting green with me , i like it because it ’s a social thing , it ’s mixed sexes and it ’s a nice thing to do that you can do in a group			0
' it ’s something that we can do as a mother and daughter , even on holiday , because we can go somewhere with a nice little golf course and play			0
' if you can give your kids a focus , they ’re not going to be as likely to focus on other things that might be worse for them			0
@entity12 now presents her own radio show on @entity260 , something that she was much rarer in @entity88 even 15 years ago ' that ’s why i ’m making a conscious effort to do these things with her , to try and get her involved in going to the local farm , trying horse riding , learning golf , to introduce her to all of these different interests			2
' and when she finally grows up , @entity12 is hoping that her daughter may be the part of the first generation who no longer have to deal with the barriers that sexism brings			1
she said : ' you ’d hope she will be the first generation not have sexism , but we do n’t really know yet			0
' i think that everything has become more equal , personally			0
' i feel very blessed that i get to do a radio show on my own for @entity260 , for example - i think there was a time before when it almost always was a two - handed thing if there was a women presenter , or you ’d be a sidekick			0
' now there are so many great female @entity288 ’s out there			0
' listen to @entity12 on @entity260 every saturday afternoon from 1 - 3pm			2
@entity260 will be going national on digital radio in january 2015 – go to ww.magic.co.uk .			0
