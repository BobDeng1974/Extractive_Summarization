in the depths of the countryside , it is not unusual to find young lambs huddled in front of a fireplace or swaddled in a blanket in a farmer 's living room as they are nursed back to health			1
however , it 's not often the newborn lambs begin to favour their newfound human surroundings over grassy fields and hay - filled barns			2
but , that ’s exactly what ’s happened to one youngster , who is now having an ‘ identity crisis ’ after preferring to be more like his dog playmate			0
miss @entity23 , 19 , only brought the newborn into the house in order to take care of him as he was abandoned by his mother and was a ' very small ' lamb			0
since then , @entity21 has adjusted to life indoors and has been spotted stealing food from the dogs ' bowls , watching tv and snuggling up for cuddles with his owner			1
miss @entity23 , a college student , said the lamb now gets on so well with the family dog , @entity55 , that they are often found playing together on the farm			2
she said : ' he was born prematurely at the end of february this year to a sheep who we thought was having twins , but actually had triplets			2
he even shares the dog 's bowl with the family 's other six dogs and likes to spend time in the family home miss @entity23 said he enjoys watching tv , having cuddles with her and eating dog food with the other animals he has formed a strong bond with the family 's dog , @entity55 , and they can often be seen playing together ' we did n't find @entity21 for a few hours by which point he was n't very well and was too small to get milk from his mum			1
' he spent about one week learning how to stand up and lived inside for over a month , usually just sitting by the dogs or on the sofa with me			2
' our dog @entity55 used to get very protective of people touching him or going near him			0
' he and @entity87 get on well together now and i often find him in the barn with him			0
' it is not the first time the family has brought a lamb into the house , but never before has one made themselves at home as much as @entity21			1
miss @entity23 said @entity21 , who has grown considerably since february , enjoys walks with the family 's dogs she said : '' our dog @entity55 used to get very protective of people touching him or going near him ' the family have moved @entity21 to a barn outside the family home , but said he is often found wandering back in the family currently have six dogs but @entity21 believes himself to be the seventh member of the pack			1
miss @entity23 said : ' @entity21 has fit right in with the dogs			2
they are all still very protective of him even though he is actually bigger than them now			0
' it must be confusing for them because @entity21 thinks he is one of them			2
the other sheep do n't like him very much though			0
' @entity21 sits and waits for his food just like the dogs and whenever he saw one of them jump onto the sofa he would try and jump up too			1
he would also come for walks round the fields too			0
' miss @entity23 is used to having sheep around , having grown up around them on the farm , and has gained vast experience through her childhood in looking after them			0
@entity21 was rather unwell and fragile when he was born in february ( pictured ) and was taken in by the family he was nursed back to health in the family 's home , where miss @entity23 fed him up and kept him warm miss @entity23 has grown up with lambs on the farm her whole life ( pictured above as a youngster with a lamb ) miss @entity23 has developed a strong bond with @entity21 ( together above ) after nursing him back to good health the pair even snuggle up on the sofa together , although @entity21 has grown remarkably since he was a baby she is currently studying for a business and management degree at @entity142 but is looking to go into vet nursing next year			1
due to his current size , @entity21 is now too big to live in the house and is currently living in a barn with three other sheep , who were also unwell when they were born			1
however , keeping @entity21 out of the house has proved difficult for the family as at any opportunity , the ' sheep dog ' likes to wander in			1
miss @entity23 added : ' he lives in a barn outside with three other sheep			0
' although , @entity21 does still like to come for a wander in the house when he gets the chance			0
' he just generally really enjoys human company			0
' miss @entity23 said @entity21 , the ' sheep dog ' is often found trotting in and out of the family home as he pleases he is now almost fully - grown and has been moved to a barn on the farm , where he lives with other sheep despite his new home , he loves popping back in to the main house for food and to see his owners and dogs			1
