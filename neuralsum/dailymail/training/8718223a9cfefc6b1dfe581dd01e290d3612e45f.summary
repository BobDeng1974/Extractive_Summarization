by @entity0 published : 21:03 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 06:11 est , 12 december 2012 cougar : a new study has found that more @entity4 women had toy - boy husbands than today 's women the ' cougar ' - or an older women who dates or marries a younger man - may seem like a modern phenomenon but new research shows that there were more women with toy - boy husbands in @entity4 times than there are today			1
a study of census data by genealogy website @entity16 also showed that there were more single mothers in 19th century @entity22 than there are in the @entity22 now			1
the study shows that while couples with 10 or more years between them nowadays comprise eight per cent of households , that figure was almost double in the 1800s			2
and while there is no particular trend for either gender to be the older spouse in the 21st century , in 61 per cent of cases the woman was the older partner two centuries previously			0
but while the modern day cougar might prey on younger men for sport , the @entity4 lady had little choice in the matter			2
in the 1800s high mortality rates , particularly in the workplace , resulted in a greater number of widows , who needed to remarry , often to younger partners , to support families			0
the study also revealed a prevalence of single - parent households during @entity50			1
these days around five per cent of households are single parent families , however a look at 1841 @entity53 results , reveals back then one in six - or 16 per cent - of homes had just one parent			0
but unlike today , the cause of the breakdown of most relationships was down to the high mortality rate - death from childbirth was far more common than divorce			0
many modern parents might bemoan the fact that they are lumbered with their children living at home for longer - but in fact the ' boomerang generation ' where adult children move back in with their parents is far from being a new thing			0
modern cougars : both @entity74 and @entity75 have been labelled as cougars , but being partnered with a younger man is not a new phenomenon according to a new study in the @entity53 , one in seven households had at least one adult - child aged 25 or older living under their roof , while today that figure is lower at 12 per cent - despite present high unemployment driving many adults back into the family home			1
same age : despite 16 per cent of @entity4 women being married to younger men , queen @entity90 was the same age as her husband @entity95 one modern development researchers found was the number of non-married , cohabiting couples			1
during the 1800s women often got married in their teens or early twenties , while today the average woman is 30 - years - old before she ties the knot			2
cohabiting couples comprised around one per cent of households during the 19th century , compared to 10 per cent today			1
@entity106 , the website 's @entity22 content manager , said : ' the millions of census records now online allow for the observation of fascinating social trends - including how today 's non-nuclear families are far from a modern trend			2
' in many ways , a married couple with 2.4 children is the real ' unconventional ' household			0
' census records are the most valuable collections available for anyone looking to begin the enthralling and rewarding journey into their family history - listing the details of millions of people living in @entity126 and @entity127 from 1841 to 1911			0

a study by genealogy website @entity16 shows that there were more women with toy - boy husbands in the @entity4 era than today
the research also found that there were more single mothers in the 19th century than now
