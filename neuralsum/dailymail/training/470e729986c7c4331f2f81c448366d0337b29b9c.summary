@entity0 is still working his magic in @entity3 ’s most famous cup competition - thanks to an @entity6 teenager			2
@entity7 , 19 , dug the @entity9 boss out of a hole after his much - changed team were on the brink of being dumped out by @entity13			1
@entity13 were better for much of the first half and took a deserved lead through @entity17 ’s vicious free - kick			1
@entity7 of @entity9 celebrates scoring the equaliser against @entity13 with team mates @entity7 earns @entity9 a well deserved @entity21 fourth round replay but @entity0 ’s team responded well after the break and got themselves back into the tie when @entity7 scored from close range after good work from substitute @entity27			1
@entity9 have earned themselves a reputation as knockout specialists in the past two seasons and arrived at @entity31 having lost just two of 18 @entity21 and @entity32 matches under @entity0			2
@entity0 puts his team ’s success in the cups down to the face that he fields his strongest side and every opportunity but he broke his own rule here by making eight changes to his starting line - up			0
that was perhaps forgivable , given the fact that this tie fell between the two legs of the @entity32 semi-final against @entity47 , added to the fact the @entity49 are pushing for promotion from @entity51			0
@entity17 scores the first goal for @entity13 in the @entity21 fourth round tie against @entity9 @entity55 's @entity54 ( left ) in action with @entity57 @entity55 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity58 6 ; @entity59 7 , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 , @entity62 6 ; @entity63 6 ( @entity64 , 63 , 6 ) , @entity65 6 ( @entity66 , 63 , 6 ) ; @entity54 6 , @entity17 7 , @entity67 8 ( @entity68 , 85 , 6 ) ; @entity69 6			1
substitutes not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 @entity9 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity74 7 ; @entity75 6 , @entity76 6 , @entity57 6 , @entity64 7 ( @entity77 , 82 , 6 ) ; @entity78 7 , @entity76 6 , @entity79 5 ( @entity27 , 56 , 7 ) , @entity80 7 , @entity81 6 ; @entity7 7 ( @entity82 , 78 , 6 ) , @entity83 6			1

bookings : @entity78 , @entity80 , @entity75			0
referee : @entity90 8/10 attendance : 10,770 match rating : 6/10 during his time as @entity96 manager , @entity93 claimed @entity17 ’s free - kicks were as good as @entity98 ’s and it looked like the former @entity3 manger had a point as @entity13 took the lead			1
@entity76 ’s clumsy challenge 35 yards from goal gave the hosts a shooting chance and @entity17 delivered , sending his vicious shot dipping over the wall and giving @entity74 no chance			2
as well as making eight changes , @entity9 also adopted an unfamiliar 3 - 5 - 2 shape and the players were clearly struggling to cope with the disruption			0
@entity64 ’ free - kick , dragged horribly wide , was as close as the visitors came to troubling @entity58 , @entity13 ’s @entity116 goalkeeper			0
the visitors were fortunate not to fall further behind in the opening stages of the second half when @entity67 , the @entity13 winger , seized upon some sloppy defending and shot at @entity74 , with the visiting goalkeeper gathering the ball at the second attempt			0
@entity55 's @entity122 ( top ) in action with @entity125 @entity80 @entity9 's @entity79 ( right ) in action with @entity55 's @entity61 @entity9 finally found some rhythm and @entity7 fashioned their first genuine chance			2
the he got to the ball ahead of @entity58 and poked his effort towards the empty net , only to see defender @entity122 recover and hook the ball away from the goal			0
the introduction of @entity27 helped the visitors keep the pressure on and he played a key role for the equaliser , making progress down the left before cutting the ball back for @entity7 to score from inside the six - yard box .			1

@entity17 opened the scoring with his fifth goal in eight games
@entity17 fired home with just 19 minutes of the first half gone
@entity7 ensured the tie would be taken back to @entity152
the 19 - year - old scored in the 68th minute to keep @entity21 dream alive
