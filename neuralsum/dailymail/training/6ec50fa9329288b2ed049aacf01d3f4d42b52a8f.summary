@entity0 believes his injury problems could possibly be ' hereditary ' as he faces more weeks out of the @entity3 side with a calf strain			1
the @entity6 striker has n't played for club or country since the beginning of september and the @entity10 have dropped points in the @entity12 without their focal point in attack			1
and @entity0 , whose uncles @entity15 and @entity17 also played professional football while his father was a trainee at @entity20 , says his struggles can be put down to a @entity23 gene pool			1
@entity0 says his injury problems could be hereditary - he is currently out with a thigh strain @entity0 's uncles @entity15 ( left ) and @entity17 ( right ) , both played professionally ( for @entity27 and @entity28 above ) @entity0 picked up his latest injury on @entity6 duty and has n't played since the beginning of september ' i play my game as best i can , but i 've been unfortunate this season , ' @entity0 told @entity34			1
' maybe it 's my body type , maybe it 's hereditary			1
' ' both my uncles had injuries , and my dad had them as well			2
maybe it 's the @entity23 vibes , maybe i have speed but maybe it makes you more vulnerable because of the fast twitch muscles and the speed in which you 're moving			2
' i am vulnerable to muscle injuries			0
as long as i continue to work hard everything will take care of itself			0
' @entity49 has filled in for the 25 - year - old as @entity52 ' side lie in seventh place in the @entity12			1
the Â£ 16million summer arrival from @entity55 has yet to score in the @entity12 and has brought his usual controversies back to @entity6 off the pitch , most notably swapping shirts with @entity59 half - way through a 3 - 0 defeat to @entity62			2
the @entity6 striker has backed team - mate @entity49 and says they can form a partnership @entity0 signs autographs before @entity3 's @entity68 game against @entity69 on tuesday however , @entity0 insists he does n't have a bad word to say about the @entity71 and that once he returns , the duo can recreate a partnership similar to his and @entity75 's last season			1
he added : ' we get on well off the field and in the changing rooms			0
we 're always laughing and joking , ' ' once i get back fit i 'm hoping we can strike up a partnership			0
last season with @entity75 [ @entity75 ] we had a great relationship up front and scored a lot of goals			0
hopefully this season it will be the same			0
