by @entity0 published : 05:56 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 05:59 est , 16 july 2013 women in @entity2 are being charged $ 5 every time they scream whilst giving birth			1
a new report from @entity6 , which focuses on corruption around the world , found that a local hospital in one of @entity12 ’s poorest countries was administering the hospital screaming fee to women who ' raised a false alarm '			2
hospitals in @entity2 charge a $ 50 ( £ 33 ) delivery fee on top of that so with the average person 's annual income at around $ 150 ( £ 99 ) , mothers who scream several times may have to part with half of their annual income			1
new @entity2 mothers are charged a $ 5 ( £ 3.30 ) ' screaming fee ' whilst giving birth in hospital as well as a $ 50 ( £ 33 ) delivery fee ( stock image ) and worse still , the report found that those women who could n't afford the fees were sometimes detained at the hospital , being charged interest until their family were able to pay off the debts for them			1
this leads numerous @entity2 mothers to give birth at home because they simply ca n’t afford the charges			1
the @entity45 found that on average eight mothers die every day during childbirth in the poverty - stricken country			2
the @entity49 reports that @entity6 's @entity2 office contacted the national health ministry by sending a formal letter regarding the issue			0
the report also found that those women who could n't afford the fees were sometimes detained at the hospital , being charged interest until their family can pay off the debts ( stock image ) while the health ministry confirmed it had received the letter , they apparently did nothing about it			0
when the @entity65 later contacted them to follow up , an official said that they had lost the letter			0
a member of @entity6 then met with @entity68 , @entity2 ’s deputy prime minister , who promised them he would look into the screaming fee issue			0
the @entity65 now say they have had no more complaints about screaming charges ; however , the $ 50 ( £ 33 ) delivery charge still remains			1
the screaming fee is just one of many examples of corruption in @entity2			0
it has also been revealed that a staggering 62 percent of people have paid a bribe to a public official in the past year .			0
