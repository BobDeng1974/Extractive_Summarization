displacing @entity0 up front for @entity2 is not something @entity4 is thinking about ahead of the @entity6 qualifier in @entity7			1
a thigh injury suffered on @entity2 duty last month has ruled @entity0 out of @entity11 's last seven matches , as well as this week 's @entity13 qualifiers			1
the 25 - year - old 's setback also meant he had to be replaced in the starting line - up to face @entity17 , giving @entity4 a rare chance as striker from the outset			2
@entity4 , one of five @entity22 players in the @entity2 squad , celebrates scoring against @entity24 @entity0 was injured during an @entity2 training session at @entity26 it was an opportunity he grasped , after scoring twice to secure a 2 - 0 win in @entity29 before netting four goals for new club @entity22 , as well as a close - range strike in the 5 - 0 defeat of @entity24 on thursday			1
@entity4 is likely to get another start up front in @entity7 , but the chance to put himself above @entity0 in the pecking order is not something he is thinking about			1
' no , because i have been in squads with @entity0 before and we have played in different positions , ' he said			0
' there is me , @entity0 , @entity43 [ @entity44 ] and @entity45 [ @entity46 ] as well and all the other forward players , so you ca n't just say this is the opportunity to make my mark			0
' whoever is in the squad i am going to try my best in every single game and training			0
@entity56 is pleased to see a group of @entity22 players forcing their way into his plans for @entity13 @entity4 is likely to start against @entity7 in the absence of injured @entity11 striker @entity0 ' playing as a centre forward and getting into those goal - scoring opportunities it becomes much easier			1
' @entity2 had to remain patient to find their way through the defence - minded @entity65 and are likely to have to do the same in @entity67 on sunday			2
' it 's a quick turnaround , ' @entity4 said of the @entity7 trip			1
' we have to travel out there and recover well as a team			0
' we need to be prepared physically , mentally and tactically for the game			0
' it 's not going to be similar to @entity24 and being away from home @entity7 are going to try and win the game , but so are we			0
' @entity2 's players including ( from left to right ) @entity44 , @entity76 and @entity77 will be looking for a third straight @entity13 qualifying win in a row on sunday			2

@entity4 has been in fine form during @entity0 's injury spell
@entity0 has been out of action since picking up a training injury
@entity22 striker @entity4 says is not thinking about moving up the @entity2 pecking order in @entity0 's absence
@entity4 is likely to get another start up front in @entity7 on sunday
