parents who give their children small amounts of alcohol in the belief they are instilling a sensible attitude to drinking may unwittingly be giving them a taste for booze , a psychologist has warned			1
@entity9 said adults needed to realise that alcohol was more damaging to the young brain and body			1
studies showed the earlier a child was introduced to drink , the greater their odds of becoming an alcoholic , he added			0
many parents believe introducing a small amount of alcohol at mealtimes teaches responsible drinking , but leading psychologist dr @entity9 says that it can do quite the opposite in a report to an @entity28 think - tank on childhood and adolescence , dr @entity9 said it was ‘ imperative ’ that parents delayed the age at which they introduce their children to alcohol			1
he said that ‘ even in small amounts ’ , alcohol may have long - lasting effects on the young brain , which continues developing long after the body matures			1
under current rules , it is illegal for under - 18s to buy alcohol or for someone to buy it for them , with the exception that 16 and 17 - year - olds can drink beer , wine or cider with a meal out with an adult			2
dr @entity9 , a fellow of the @entity54 , said parents were wrong if they believe that by giving their children small amounts of alcohol at home , they were teaching them to drink responsibly			1
in fact , research suggests that early exposure to alcohol primes the brain to enjoy it more			0
dr @entity9 ’s review of medical literature also raised concerns that girls who drink may be raising their odds of infertility and breast cancer in later life			1
the new @entity28 commissioned study has said that drinking even small quantities of alcohol in youth can have far - reaching consequences he said that in an ideal world , no one would touch alcohol before the age of 25			1
however , he acknowledged that 16 was a more realistic age for parents to first allow their children to drink at home			0
for instance , a @entity87 government - funded study found that that those who had their first drink before the age of 18 ran a ‘ far greater ’ risk of becoming dependent on alcohol as adults			1
and the @entity99 has stated : ‘ the longer the onset of consumption is delayed , the less likely it is that alcohol - related problems and alcohol dependence will emerge in adult life			2
’ official advice in @entity103 is similar – but few parents realise , says dr @entity9			1
others may fear that stopping youngsters from drinking at home risks will simply increase alcohol ’s appeal			2
he also uses his report to call for the legal drinking age , at which youngsters can buy alcohol in pubs and shops , to be harmonised at 18 across @entity117			0
dr @entity9 , who has previously called for tv to be banned for toddlers , concludes : ‘ adults need to be fully aware that their favourite substance may have new - found consequences when young people consume it			1
‘ protecting our young people from the harm of drinking means that now , in the light of new information about the effects of alcohol , it is necessary to review the way the entire @entity28 views concepts of adulthood and drinking age			0
’ experts say few of these would be regarded by other members of the public as alcoholics			0
rather they are apparently normal people who are unwittingly drinking too much			0
@entity143 , of charity @entity144 said : ‘ it may feel that introducing children to alcohol in a safe and controlled environment at home is the right thing to do , but all the research indicates that the younger someone starts drinking , the more likely they are to have problems with alcohol in later life			0
‘ the chief medical officer advises that an alcohol free childhood is the safest option and that those under 15 year olds , ideally , should not drink at all			0
’ dr @entity9 ’s warnings come amid concerns about soaring rates of liver disease			1
recent figures show that alcohol - related liver damage is becoming increasingly common in the under - 30s , with the number of hospital admissions in this age group more than doubling between 2002 and 2012			2
across all age groups , an extra 1,000 people with alcohol - related liver damage are being admitted to hospitals in @entity175 each year			2
experts say few of these would be regarded by other members of the public as alcoholics			0
rather they are apparently ordinary people who are unwittingly drinking too much			0
this includes middle - aged , middle - class women who enjoy a bottle of wine a day , or successful businessmen who have working lunches .			0

many parents believe small quantities of alcohol teaches responsible drinking
but a study , led by psychologist dr @entity9 , says parents must delay giving drug in childhood because it can do long - lasting *neurological* damage
