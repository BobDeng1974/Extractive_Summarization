by @entity0 published : 11:37 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 31 october 2013 giant steps taken by the biggest dinosaur that ever strode the @entity4 have been reconstructed by scientists			1
@entity7 , from @entity6 , was able to walk for the first time in more than 94 million years - virtually , on a computer screen			1
its movements were modelled by experts from the @entity13 who laser scanned a 40 metre - long skeleton of the 80 tonne beast housed in an @entity18 museum			1
a reconstructed skeleton of the giant dinosaur argentinosaurus at the @entity22 museum in @entity23 , @entity18			2
scientists from the @entity13 have reconstructed the giant dinosaur 's steps to show how it walked @entity7 is a type of titanosaur sauropod - part of a family of incredibly large dinosaurs			1
it was first discovered in @entity18 , hence its name			0
the dinosaur lived on the then - island continent of @entity6 somewhere between 97 and 94 million years ago , during the @entity36			1
it is among the largest known dinosaurs			0
an early reconstruction estimated @entity7 at between 30â € “ 40 metres ( 98â € “ 115 ft ) in length with a weight of up to 80â € “ 100 tonnes			2
the simulation used artificially intelligent software and processing power the equivalent of 30,000 desktop computers			1
lead scientist dr @entity49 , from the university 's @entity47 , said : ' if you want to work out how dinosaurs walked , the best approach is computer simulation			2
' this is the only way of bringing together all the different strands of information we have on this dinosaur , so we can reconstruct how it once moved			2
' the simulated footprints of the 40 - metre @entity62 dinosaur skeleton some sceptics have doubted that such a heavy animal could have walked and suggested that estimates of its weight must be inflated			1
dr @entity68 , another member of the @entity13 team , said : ' the new study clearly demonstrates the dinosaur was more than capable of strolling across the @entity73 planes of what is now @entity75 , @entity6			1
' co-author , dr @entity76 , also from the university , said : ' the digitisation of such vast dinosaur skeletons using laser scanners brings @entity78 to life - this is science , not just animation			0
' the scientists ' study was published in journal @entity86			0
@entity7 was a plant - eater that stood as tall as a three - storey building and stretched to 38 metres ( 125 feet ) in length			0
when it was alive , the @entity92 mountains were mere hillocks and arid @entity75 consisted of steamy jungle and grassland			0
dr @entity49 said : ' the important thing is that these animals are not like any animal alive today and so we ca n't just copy a modern animal			0
dr @entity49 , from the @entity13 said that computer simulation is the best way of working out how dinosaurs walked and a way of collecting different strands of information together			1
a computer simulation of the dinosaur 's joints is pictured ' our machine learning system works purely from the information we have on the dinosaur and predicts the best possible movement patterns			2
' ' @entity116 is the biggest animal that ever walked on the surface of the earth and understanding how it did this will tell us a lot about the maximum performance of the vertebrate musculoskeletal system			0
we need to know more about this to help understand how it functions in ourselves			0
' similarly if we want to build better legged robots then we need to know more about the mechanics of legs in a whole range of animals and nothing has bigger , more powerful legs than @entity7			0

experts from the @entity13 digitally reconstructed the steps taken by a huge dinosaur called @entity62
the *prehistoric* animals from @entity6 weighed 80 tonnes and had a top *speed* of five *mph*
the simulation used artificially intelligent software and processing power the equivalent of 30,000 desktop computers
