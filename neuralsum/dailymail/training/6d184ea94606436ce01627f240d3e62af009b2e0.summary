the @entity1 's search for the next ' big thing ' commenced this weekend , but the judges need look no further than @entity5 's face , which is possibly the biggest thing on the show			1
of late , the new dad 's face seems to have inflated somewhat			2
the difference between @entity5 's appearance now and when he first appeared on the @entity1 in 2002 is startling			1
so what might be causing this puffiness ? ' let 's be frank			0
the first and most obvious factor is that he ’s put on weight			0
he ’s aged , he 's over 50 and it shows , ' says @entity20 cosmetic doctor dr @entity19			0
although admittedly , at 55 , the music mogul is looking pretty good			0
' but are there are other factors that have caused this mega transformation from the slim - faced @entity5 who dated @entity31 back in the eighties to the puffy version we see on our screens today ? ' it looks like he 's had fillers in the cheek area to try and improve the contours and lift the lower face but as a result he looks a little unnatural and too cheeky , ' says dr @entity19			1
the changing face of @entity5 : in the eighties ( left ) and in 2001 ( right ) he may not have change his t - shirt but he does change his face : in 2002 ( left ) and 2003 ( right ) ' in my @entity50 some celebrities , like @entity48 and @entity49 , have over-filled their faces in the cheek area and i think he 's fallen into that trap , ' he continues			1
' men generally have flat faces with only a little bit of a cheek bone			0
unfortunately some cosmetic doctors do n’t understand the artistics between male and female face and they inflate the male face like it 's a woman 's			2
' so you get these round cheeks like @entity5 's , which does n’t work on a man because it looks abnormal , ' he adds			1
it 's no secret that @entity5 has a penchant for @entity72			2
during an interview with newsreader @entity74 , published in the @entity75 last year he said of his lifestyle , ‘ i work out three or four times a week , i have @entity72 , take tons of vitamins and vitamin infusions			0
’ dr @entity19 also points out that @entity5 's large head is caught in a vicious cycle			1
' he ’s been very vocal about having @entity72 treatment but the problem is , if you have treatment over time , the forehead maintains smoothness but the rest of the face loosens , which can look quite odd in comparison			2
this perpetuates the need for fillers in the cheek area			0
' the widening face of @entity5 : in 2004 ( left ) and 2005 ( right ) same outfit , different year : in 2008 ( left ) and 2010 ( right ) according to dr @entity19 , @entity5 's sun habit also means he 's more likely to keep needing fillers			1
' you always see pictures of @entity5 on his jet ski in @entity105 but all that sun exposure is robbing the skin of collagen and elastin , which makes it loser so the tissues sag more			2
so when you try to improve that with fillers , the cycle continues			0
' medical aesthetic doctor , dr @entity114 adds that there are many other factors that can cause a puffy face , known in medical terms as a ' moon face '			1
' alcohol , steroid treatment , and lifestyle choices can all be a factor			0
people take steroids for all sorts of reasons from asthma to atheritis			0
but there are other medications that can also cause the face to flare up , ' she says			0
a smiling @entity5 : in 2011 ( left ) and 2012 ( right ) the latest inflation : in 2013 ( left ) and this weekend ( right ) ' in @entity5 's case it 's most likely to be a combination of lifestyle choices and problems with the aesthetic treatment he 's had			1
maybe he 's had @entity72 too close to filming and it has n't settled down , ' continues dr @entity142			0
' if you think about @entity5 ’s lifestyle , he 's admitted before that he does n’t sleep well and if he is n't getting a decent night 's sleep that could contribute to a bloated appearance , ' adds dr @entity142			1
when he appeared on @entity149 's life stories a few year ago , the 55 - year - old admitted , ' almost every night i will be working until four or five in the morning ... i take sleeping pills almost every night because i freak out at the thought that i ca n't sleep			2
the more i think about it , the more it bothers me			0
' and with a new baby in his life , @entity5 's sleeping regime is likely to have further deteriorated			1
well if this season 's talent is n't engaging enough , at least there is something to keep us transfixed by the @entity1 - the enigma that is @entity5 's inflatable head .			1

@entity5 's large head took centre stage on this week 's @entity1
his cheeks appeared puffy and face inflated
doctors blame star 's aesthetic treatment
factors such as lack of sleep and sun damage could perpetuate cycle
