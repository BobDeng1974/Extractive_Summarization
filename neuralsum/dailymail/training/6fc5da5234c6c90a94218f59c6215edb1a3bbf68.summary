by @entity1 - squire published : 16:00 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 22 june 2013 relief : the new test told @entity4 and @entity5 their twins are healthy for expectant parents , whether or not to test their unborn child for @entity10 ’s syndrome can be an agonising decision			1
routine scans at ten and 13 weeks can flag up a heightened risk of the condition , which causes lifelong disability and a host of complex health problems			1
but a definitive diagnosis can be given only after amniocentesis , an invasive procedure that draws amniotic fluid from around the baby with a needle and syringe – and brings with it a risk of miscarriage			1
now , @entity4 and @entity5 , who are expecting twins , have become one of the first couples in the @entity31 to benefit from a controversial blood test that can accurately identify @entity10 ’s and eliminate the danger of the traditional method			1
more than 98 per cent accurate for twins and 99 per cent accurate for a single baby , the new non-invasive @entity36 test – one of a number of similar tests – requires no more than a blood sample drawn from the pregnant woman ’s arm			1
however , disability campaigners believe that if such a test were to become widely available , it would increase terminations of @entity10 ’s babies – nine in ten women given the news choose to have an abortion			1
at present , mothers to be are given a combined test for the syndrome at the end of the first trimester			2
it comprises an ultrasound known as a @entity62 ( @entity61 ) scan , which measures the fluid behind the baby ’s neck , a larger amount of which can indicate @entity10 ’s , and a blood test , which looks for hormones and proteins related to the syndrome			1
the two results are combined to give a risk rating			2
if the risk is high , then women are offered amniocentesis			2
because these hormones and proteins are already higher in a multiple pregnancy , women expecting twins have only the @entity61 scan – which is 80 per cent accurate			0
the combined test is 90 per cent accurate at best			2
it was after the @entity61 scan that doctors first alerted the @entity84 to potential problems			0
@entity4 , 29 , an accountant , from @entity86 , @entity87 , explains : ‘ they said there was more fluid than was usual around one baby ’s neck			1
light of our lives : @entity96 , 43 , whose daughter @entity97 , right , was born with @entity10 ' we were shocked when the doctor told us he thought it could be @entity10 ’s syndrome			1
it was very upsetting as these are our first babies and i had n’t had any problems before			0
’ with amniocentesis , performed from 15 weeks , there is a one in 100 chance of miscarriage – and with twins this risk is doubled			1
@entity4 says : ‘ had i not had the new test , i would have faced a terrible dilemma about whether or not to have an amniocentesis			2
although we would have wanted to know our babies were healthy , the thought we could risk losing them was devastating			2
’ thankfully for @entity4 , her consultant suggested having the @entity119 test , which has been available privately since may			2
she chose the screening at 12 weeks , and ten days later the results showed her babies were healthy			0
now 17 weeks pregnant , she says : ‘ it was a huge relief to be given the all - clear			0
i ’m looking forward to enjoying the rest of my pregnancy without worry			0
’ the couple ’s doctor , dr @entity128 , a consultant in foetal medicine at the @entity130 , @entity131 , wants the @entity134 to provide the test as a routine screening			2
‘ every year hundreds of healthy babies are miscarried during amniocentesis , ’ says dr @entity128			0
‘ the @entity134 should n’t be delaying this test			2
instead , it should be making it standard practice			0
new test : the @entity36 test requires no more than a blood sample drawn from a pregnant woman ¿ s arm ‘ far fewer mums to be will then need to have an amniocentesis and it will therefore save precious lives			1
’ of the 750,000 women in @entity31 who become pregnant each year , 30,000 are offered amniocentesis to test a potential problem			0
but 41 per cent of those women decide not to have the test – or any other screenings available on the @entity134			0
the new procedure identifies what is known as cell - free dna ( @entity160 ) , tiny fragments of foetal genetic material circulating in the mother ’s blood			0
as well as @entity10 ’s syndrome , this dna can be tested for other chromosomal conditions such as @entity167 and @entity169 syndromes , both of which cause severe brain abnormalities and heart defects and mean babies rarely live beyond a year			1
@entity10 ’s syndrome is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability , and about 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the @entity31			1
it is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 in a baby ’s cells , the reasons for which are still unknown			0
the age at which a woman becomes pregnant is the only clear factor identified as increasing the likelihood of having a baby with @entity10 ’s			1
a woman of 25 has a risk of one in 1,250			0
this risk increases to one in 400 for women of 35 , and one in 100 for women of 40			0
by the time a woman is 45 , there is a one in 30 chance			0
yet critics argue the new test – being trialled for the @entity134 at @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 , @entity207 – will mean women are railroaded into having an abortion			0
@entity96 , 43 , from @entity210 , @entity211 , whose second daughter @entity97 , six , was born with @entity10 ’s , runs website @entity213 to help educate people about the condition			1
‘ if a test is routinely offered – rather than given as a choice – it is ultimately being recommended			0
when the test is positive , most women are then offered an immediate termination – very few are asked if they would like to meet a family with a child with @entity10 ’s or even told another option truly is to keep their baby			1
’ @entity96 , whose elder daughter @entity228 is nine , adds : ‘ my husband @entity229 and i had no idea we were having a baby with @entity10 ’s and , devastatingly , doctors said @entity97 might not walk or even talk			1
‘ but she ’s at mainstream school and is the light of our lives			0

new non-invasive test for @entity10 **'s** eliminates risk for miscarriage
instead of drawing fluid from around the baby it is a simple blood test
disability campaigners fear it will see more @entity10 **'s** *foetuses* aborted
