overcharge : @entity1 customers are up in arms since it we revealed that @entity5 fast food restaurant has been rounding up bills to the nearest nickel in high - volume locations like @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 @entity30 notified the @entity31 about the strange pattern he 'd been noticing on his receipts			1
' the receipts at the @entity1 in @entity35 do n’t add up when there are odd amounts involved , ' he told the paper			1
he shared several receipts with the paper , showing how the company was adding ' rounding ' charges to his bill			2
on july 13 , he purchased $ 32.93 worth of food , with $ 2.31 worth of tax , but somehow it added up to $ 35.25 , rather than $ 35.24			2
another receipt showed a subtotal of $ 8.64 with a tax of $ 0.60 , but the total was $ 9.25 rather than $ 9.24			0
he said it was n't so much the pennies that bothered him , but the principle that the store was rounding up receipts , without telling their customers			2
mr @entity30 asked the manager of his local @entity1 what had caused the confusion and he got a lackluster response			1
' oh , it ’s a computer program			0
it is just rounding numbers			0
it takes a little from certain receipts and gives a little to others			0
what do you want ? a few pennies ? ' the manager told him			0

what do you want ? a few pennies ? ' chipotle manager ' it ’s something we do in some high volume markets , including @entity10 , ' said spokesman @entity106			0
' the way it works is that prices auto - round to the nearest quarter and that ’s indicated on the receipt			2
the idea is simply to limit the possible combinations of change on cash transactions to keep the lines moving quickly in high volume areas			0
' furthermore , @entity1 has said it will no longer round up , only down			1
' it was never our intention to have a policy that was confusing or misleading , ' mr @entity106 said .			0

@entity1 restaurants *routinely* round up customer *'s* bills to a nickel
*previously* , did not warn customers at the register
after *public* *investigation* , now they will only round down
