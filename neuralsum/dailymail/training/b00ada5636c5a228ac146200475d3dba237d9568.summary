the biopic of @entity5 , @entity23 , has attracted controversy for its portrayal of her illness			2
and now it seems mr @entity2 , who is writing a book about the formidable former prime minister , is fanning the flames by revealing his own account of her dementia			1
mrs @entity5 attended a dinner party at mr @entity2 's house when another guest - also a politician - started talking about mr @entity8 , it was reported			1
mr @entity2 , a former @entity7 minister , told the @entity38 : ' i had one member of the cabinet [ at the table ] who asked something about @entity8			1

i ca n't ever say i felt protective to her when she was in power , but i felt very lovingly protective towards her then			0
' mr @entity2 , whose political career ended in a spectacular fall from grace in the late 1990s , gave a revealing account of what it is like to be in mrs @entity5 's company since the onset of her dementia			1

the film has been criticised for its portrayal of mrs @entity5 's illness while she is still alive - a point reiterated by mr @entity2			2
