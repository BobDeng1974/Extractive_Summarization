a cd of the sounds of silence from inside a village church has sold out after becoming an unlikely hit			1
the 30 - minute recording was originally created to help raise some extra funds for repairs to @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
church members believed the atmosphere in their small 12th century church was so unique that its peacefulness would appeal to a wider audience			1
unlikely sell - out : @entity18 30 - minute cd recording from inside @entity8 has attracted buyers from as far afield as @entity20 so they left some recording equipment on inside the building for half - an - hour			1
the only sounds that can be heard on the @entity0 are the odd squeaking of the wooden pews , some footsteps and the distant hum of passing traffic			0
after selling out of the cd during a recent open day the church has now taken orders for it from as far afield as @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity20			1
@entity34 , 74 , from @entity9 , the church member who came up with the idea , said : ' the church was planning an open day and wanted something a little bit different to catch the attention of people who were coming along			2
' the church has got quite good recording equipment so we decided to make a cd of 30 minutes of silence			1
' it is pretty much silence throughout with a few background noises			0
' there are a few little noises here and there - i think if it was total silence people might get a bit bored			2
ancient times : members of the congregation at the 12th century church in @entity9 , @entity10 , are amazed the @entity0 has become such a hit ' so if you listen carefully you will hear some pews squeaking , footsteps and the distant hum of traffic going past outside			2
' the people who have bought it say they have really enjoyed it			0
' in this day and age everybody seems to live busier , noisier lives			0
' people sometimes like to sit down and just have a bit of peace and quiet for a little while			0
' this cd is great for that and people have mentioned it is very relaxing to listen to			0
' it has also been used by people for meditation , which i think is splendid			0
' dr @entity82 , the @entity83 of @entity8 , said : ' it is an 800 - year - old sacred space with a wonderful quality of silence			2
' we thought the idea of the peaceful silence you get inside the church could be something a little it different and i 'm delighted it has proved so popular			1
' at first there were one or two skeptical responses but in the end i think everybody agreed it was a very good idea			0
