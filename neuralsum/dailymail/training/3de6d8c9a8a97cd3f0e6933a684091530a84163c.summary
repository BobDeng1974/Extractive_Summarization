@entity1 supporters were left frustrated on saturday evening when the club 's official channel cut out during the friendly match against @entity5 and failed to broadcast a @entity7 goal			1
@entity9 's transmission from @entity10 had been running according to plan when it suddenly lost signal moments before half - time with @entity1 two goals to the good after brilliant goals by @entity7 and @entity16			1
as it transpired , it was dreadful timing for the club 's in - house media channel as they missed the moment when @entity37 was brought down to win a penalty			0
the @entity1 @entity40 account attributed the fault to electrical problems at the stadium , saying : ' we apologise for any loss of picture on @entity9			0
this is due to a power failure at the stadium in @entity10			0
' @entity7 converted the spot - kick to extend @entity1 's advantage to 3 - 0 heading into the interval			1
the problem continued into the half - time break , leaving only a few minutes for analysis , although order was restored for the second - half			0
penalty king : @entity7 netted from the spot shortly before half - time			2

@entity1 fans were left disappointed as they missed @entity7 's goal
the club took to @entity40 to apologise for any *inconvenience* caused
@entity1 raced into a 3 - 0 lead at half - time against @entity71 *giants* @entity5
