as @entity1 chase fourth spot in the @entity3 and another place at @entity6 's top table , @entity0 will be well aware of the improvement his side must make on the continent			1
thursday night 's penalty shootout defeat by @entity12 in @entity13 ended their @entity15 campaign at the first hurdle , just two - and - a - half months on from @entity18 disappointment			1
@entity0 ' men were expected to make it through @entity21 along with @entity22 but could only finish third behind @entity23 and @entity22 after a series of underwhelming displays at home and abroad			0
@entity1 defender @entity27 puts his penalty high and wide during his side 's penalty shootout defeat @entity12 players celebrate after dumping @entity1 out of the @entity15 on thursday evening in @entity13 @entity0 shakes hands with @entity34 after @entity1 's penalty shootout defeat @entity1 dropped into the @entity15 after finishing third in their @entity18 group games played : 8 won : 2 lost : 4 @entity39 : 2 goals scored : 6 goals conceded : 10 a drop into @entity6 's secondary competition followed but @entity44 could n't reproduce their domestic form at the @entity46 , falling to a 1 - 0 defeat on the night before exiting via spot - kicks			1
the result completed what has been a miserable season in @entity6 for @entity0 , a manager whose lack of experience has told since the @entity55 ' first nervy , narrow win at home to @entity58 minnows @entity57 in september			2
the statistics make for grim reading - played eight , lost four , won two , drawn two and just six goals scored , two of which were penalties			0
@entity1 are flying domestically but in @entity6 it 's been a different story			0
@entity66 opens the scoring in @entity22 's 3 - 0 group stage win at @entity69 in october @entity70 celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity1 at the @entity72 in november after the aforementioned 2 - 1 victory at @entity69 , everything went downhill			2
home and away defeats by @entity22 were to be expected to some extent , but failing to beat @entity57 away and losing to @entity23 were unacceptable results			0
the dominance of @entity80 's men meant that @entity0 still had a chance to lead his side through to the last 16 on matchday six but again they faltered , only managing a 1 - 1 draw at home to the @entity86 champions when they had to win			2
they finished the group stage with just one victory , five points and five goals scored			0
after working so hard to end the club 's @entity18 absence , the players did n't do themselves justice			0
@entity1 are the @entity3 's form team , unbeaten in 11 matches and well in the hunt for fourth - or even third - place after a slow start to the season			1
@entity103 's goal for @entity23 at @entity69 helped eliminate @entity1 at the @entity18 group stage @entity55 skipper @entity105 looks dejected after playing his last @entity18 game for the club but with @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 also battling for a place in the top four , winning the @entity15 was an attractive way of qualifying for next season 's @entity18			1
a 1 - 0 home win against @entity12 kept that dream alive but a limp performance in @entity13 - the setting for that memorable victory over @entity120 in 2005 - meant that progression always looked unlikely , even with the unpredictable nature of penalty shootouts			0
@entity1 appear well - placed to earn a spot in @entity6 next season , but it 'll be another disheartening experience if @entity0 ca n't get his players to take their league form to the continent .			1

@entity1 were dumped out of the @entity15 by @entity12 in @entity13
the @entity55 only won one of their six @entity18 group games
@entity0 ' side scored just six goals in eight @entity139 games
@entity1 are the @entity3 's form team and are unbeaten in 11
