uncapped leg - spinner @entity1 will be available , alongside slow left - armer @entity7 , for the @entity2 in @entity3			1
@entity4 , who has played just one @entity2 - more than three years ago in @entity18 - will also report to @entity3 but not in time to figure in the fourth test			2
@entity20 to do it ? @entity23 leg - spinner @entity1 was given tips by @entity26 legend @entity25 before the third test in @entity28 and will now join the @entity12 squad for the final two @entity30 in @entity3 and @entity31 @entity12 have already lost the @entity30 , conceding an unassailable 3 - 0 lead to their hosts after a third successive wide - margin defeat in @entity35 last week			1
it is highly unlikely that two spinners would be considered at the @entity3 , but possible for the final test in @entity31			0

' @entity4 will arrive in @entity3 during the fourth test and will be available for selection for the final test in @entity31 beginning on january 3			2

waving goodbye : @entity9 announced his immediate retirement from cricket on sunday on stand by : @entity7 is set to replace @entity9 in @entity12 's bowling attack against @entity60 in the fourth test in @entity3			0
