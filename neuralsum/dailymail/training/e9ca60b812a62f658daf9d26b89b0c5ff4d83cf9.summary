by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 15 october 2013 any mother with a teething child will know that anything and everything becomes a target for a baby 's gnawing gums - especially the jewellery dangling temptingly within their grasp			1
but not only does that mean your favourite beads becoming covered in a fine layer of drool and tiny tooth imprints , but beads can be dangerous for babies to put in their mouths , whether because they are covered in toxic paint , easily breakable or sharp			2
now one company @entity21 is aiming to tackle this problem by creating a range of fashion jewellery mothers will actually be keen to wear - but that babies can use to soothe their painful gums			1
@entity21 allows mothers to keep following fashions while also removing the worry that their little one will put something dangerous in their mouths all @entity21 pieces are made of non toxic siilcone that is free from lead , latex , @entity36 , pvc and phthalates @entity39 and @entity40 have spoken out about their love for the product the aim is that mothers should still be able to look fashionable while wearing something that baby can safely get their teeth into ( literally )			1
started by @entity49 , 37 , from @entity50 , @entity21 already has a celebrity following , with the @entity52 reporting that @entity53 , @entity40 , @entity54 and @entity39 are fans			1
@entity49 , mother to @entity57 , five , and @entity53 , three , came up with the concept for @entity21 when @entity53 was teething			1
the products are simple and elegant , but most importantly safe for baby @entity21 's @entity53 heart pendant in @entity62 , £ 12.95 ( left ) , @entity21 's @entity63 in @entity64 , £ 15.95 ( right ) @entity49 said : ‘ @entity53 was a nightmare teether			1
there were times i would strap teething rings to my neck so i always had something to hand			0
‘ then it struck me that i could come up with something that looked good and doubled as a teether			2
’ some babies are born with their first teeth , others start teething before they are four months old , and some after 12 months			2
early teething should not cause a child any problems , unless it affects their feeding			2
you may notice that the gum is sore and red where the tooth is coming through , or that one cheek is flushed			0
your baby may dribble , gnaw and chew a lot , or just be fretful			0
as well as giving safe things to chew , cool drinks , sugar - free teething gel and infant painkillers can help			1
if you baby is dribbling a lot , be sure to wipe their face often to prevent a rash			0
some people attribute a wide range of symptoms to teething , such as diarrhoea and fever , however , there is no research to prove that these other symptoms are linked			0
source : @entity107 originally working on the company in her spare time , @entity49 has now left her job in the pharmaceutical industry to focus on the company , along with her husband @entity113 , 44			2
the pieces , which cost from £ 8.95 for a bangle , are simple but elegant and include pendants , beaded necklaces , bangles and even dog tags for men			0
as well as allowing mothers to continue accessorising during their child 's teething , wearing the teether means there is always something available for the baby to chew on			1
in addition to easing discomfort , chewing while teething is beneficial as it helps the new teeth erupt			0
the dishwasher - safe necklaces , which are made of non toxic silicone that is free from lead , latex , @entity36 , @entity137 and phthalates , all feature a breakaway clasp so they come away if baby pulls rather than hurting the wearer			1
silicone is ideal for the pieces as it is odourless , tasteless and will not support the growth of bacteria or mould			0
@entity149 stress on their website that the necklaces are only intended for an adult to wear and children must only have access to it when worn by an adult			0
however , the bangles can be left with the child unattended .			0
