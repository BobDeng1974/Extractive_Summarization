the hospital has now paid damages after admitting it did not follow the correct procedure			0
mrs @entity5 was given a pregnancy test when she was prescribed the drug , but it came back negative because she was only in the very early stages of her pregnancy			1

mrs @entity5 , from @entity39 , @entity40 , who named her unborn girl @entity42 , said yesterday : ‘ @entity42 was devastating but to find out after that her condition , and subsequent death , could have been prevented is almost unbearable			1
’ mrs @entity5 was referred to a @entity47 hospital dermatologist after suffering for a year from bad acne on her neck and chest			1
the condition meant she was unable to wear many of her clothes because she only felt comfortable if her skin was fully covered up			0

‘ i was given an oral contraceptive pill on the same day i was given the drug and they did a pregnancy test and i was told that it came back negative			0
' about two weeks after i started taking it i became very sick and ill and when i went to my gp he said it was a strong drug and my body was just not agreeing with it			0
‘ i persevered for another week and i tried to just get on with it because they went to all this trouble to prescribe this drug to me			0
