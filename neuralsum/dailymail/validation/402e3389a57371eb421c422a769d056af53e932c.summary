the former boss of @entity1 is set to pocket a £ 1million bonus from the state - backed lender – two years after he was dramatically forced out of his job by @entity6			1
there was growing outrage last night that @entity9 will get such a huge sum from a bank that was bailed out by the taxpayer			2
he could receive more than 500,000 shares in @entity1 – worth up to £ 1.9million – as part of a long - term incentive scheme dating from his days in charge			1
however mr @entity9 , who now runs insurance firm @entity18 , is unlikely to receive the full entitlement because not all the terms have been met			2
@entity9 , left with a @entity21 , is set to pocket a £ 1million bonus from the @entity1 in january 2012 , when he was still at the helm of @entity1 , mr @entity9 turned down a controversial bonus worth almost £ 1million after caving in to ‘ enormous political pressure ’ despite the backing of the bank ’s board			1
at the time he was being paid £ 1.2million a year – or 46 times the average salary of employees in @entity31			0
mr @entity9 was brought in to turn around beleaguered @entity1 after the departure of disgraced predecessor @entity33			1
news that he continues to receive millions from his tenure at the bank has sparked fury after @entity1 last week revealed a seventh consecutive year of annual losses			2
@entity40 of the @entity41 ’ @entity39 said : ‘ until @entity1 is able to stand on its own two feet , it needs to seriously rein in payoffs , bonuses and these long - term incentives			1
‘ the chancellor needs to stand up to those in the organisation who seem to have forgotten that taxpayers bailed the bank out			0
shareholders must be heard – and at @entity1 , that includes taxpayers			1
’ @entity1 ’s earnings have been hammered by a spiralling bill for its past misdemeanours – including those during mr @entity9 ’s reign			1
last week it reported a £ 3.5billion annual loss and announced that former @entity60 boss sir @entity59 will take over from sir @entity61 as chairman			0
it set aside £ 2.2billion to cover legal claims , including £ 320million to pay further fines in the @entity65 for rigging foreign currency markets and an extra £ 400million in the last three months of 2014 for mis - selling payment protection insurance			2
@entity1 , which has been propped up by £ 46billion of taxpayers ’ money since the 2008 financial crisis , still has the power to scrap or delay mr @entity9 ’s bonus			1
shareholders have complained for years that it continues to hand ‘ extraordinary ’ packages to top staff			0
the government has a 79 per cent stake in the bank , although it is eager to see it back in private hands			0
however , with the share price around 370p – still well below the 455p the @entity83 needs to recoup its money – a sale remains a long way off			0
conservative mp @entity92 , a member of the influential @entity93 , said : ‘ success for @entity1 will be when it is back in the private sector			0
so , given the current environment , i do n’t think that people should be taking bonuses until such time that it is fully privatised again			0
’ @entity1 refused to comment .			0
