by @entity0 published : 19:56 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 19:58 est , 17 october 2013 @entity3 should leave the @entity5 human rights system if it will not repeal the ban on prisoners ’ voting , its most senior official has declared			1
by continuing to defy the ruling allowing prisoners to vote , @entity9 , human rights commissioner at the @entity10 , said the whole system might ‘ unravel			1
’ his strong letter to @entity15 mp , who chairs the parliamentary committee looking at the draft prisoners voting bill , is likely to escalate the simmering row with @entity21 over the issue			1
warning : @entity5 's most senior human rights official said that the @entity24 , pictured , must be obeyed he wrote : ‘ if the @entity3 , a founding member of the @entity10 and one which has lost relatively few cases at the court , decides to ‘ cherry pick ’ and selectively implement judgments , other states will invariably follow suit and the system will unravel very quickly			1
‘ thus , my message is clear : the @entity31 's judgments have to be executed and the automatic and indiscriminate ban on voting rights for prisoners should be repealed			2
if the court system is to continue to provide protection , there is no alternative to this for member states , other than leaving the system itself			0
’ the @entity10 which has 47 members , operates the controversial @entity24 , which ruled in 2005 that banning all prisoners from voting was unlawful			2
but ministers have resisted changing the law with mps voting by an overwhelming majority two years ago to maintain the status quo			0
@entity55 said in november 2010 : ‘ it makes me physically ill to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison ’			0
and last year he insisted : ‘ no one should be under any doubt – prisoners are not getting the vote under this government			0
’ last night @entity65 mp @entity64 said : ‘ mr @entity66 is desperate to defend the international gravy train he has made a living out of			0
' i suspect the bleatings of a career @entity5 quangocrat will only stiffen the spine of mps who want to defend @entity3 democracy , not @entity5 bureaucracy			1
’ defiant : @entity65 mp @entity64 said the warning would ' stiffen the spine ' of mps who want to resist @entity5 's power over them a ruling by the @entity3 @entity31 this week dismissed an appeal by two murderers who claimed it was a breach of both the @entity85 and @entity87 law to ban them from voting			1
but , in a significant blow to @entity55 , the judges failed to rule that the @entity3 ’s existing blanket ban on prisoners taking part in elections is lawful			2
the verdict will thus intensify the pressure on ministers to grant at least some convicts the vote – or risk handing out millions in compensation for breaching their ‘ rights ’			0
mr @entity9 comments were published in evidence to the joint commons and @entity108 parliamentary committee considering the prisoner votes , which published a draft bill last year			2
the bill sets out three options : a ban for prisoners sentenced to four years or more , a ban for prisoners sentenced to more than six months , or continuing to defy @entity21			0
mr @entity118 ' letter adds : ‘ a withdrawal from the @entity24 would cast doubt on the @entity3 's commitment to @entity123 values and acceptance of @entity123 mechanisms such as the @entity126 and treaty monitoring bodies			1
' the @entity3 's voice with regard to human rights issues in other countries would clearly be less credible			1
’ @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 are all members of the @entity10			0
the only @entity5 nation that refuses to join is @entity139 , whose human rights record has been widely criticised			1
at the @entity145 conference last month , home secretary @entity142 and justice secretary @entity143 suggested a future @entity65 government could leave the @entity147 has lost 202 cases at the @entity24 since 1998			2
the people who brought the cases , who included criminals , received £ 1.7million in compensation			0
the total bill , including legal costs , is around £ 4.4million .			0
