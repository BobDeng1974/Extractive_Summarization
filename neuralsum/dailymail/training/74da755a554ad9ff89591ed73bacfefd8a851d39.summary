the extraordinary claim by @entity2 , a senior director of the @entity16 , coincided with energy companies refusing to rule out more price rises			1
mr @entity2 warned that providing ‘ the luxury of electricity that we desire ’ would mean customers paying billions more to upgrade the power network			1

ministers unveiled measures which they promised would take £ 50 off the average bill			0
but power firms will not pass on the savings until deep into the winter months , leaving customers paying higher rates over @entity38			1
and despite trimming their tariffs , every major supplier yesterday left the door open for another crippling increase			0

’ @entity74 , director at price comparison site @entity76 , said : ‘ to use the word luxury was misguided			1

subsidies for wind farms and solar panels could face the axe after energy minister @entity96 said it was ‘ immoral ’ to pin the cost on taxpayers			2
the average household pays £ 30 a year for large - scale renewable schemes			0
they are the second biggest green levy on bills , after insulation schemes – which the government has just cut			0
but subsidies often go to landowners who rake in thousands of pounds a year from green energy			2
mr @entity96 said wind farms and large solar farms were ‘ mature technologies ’ which no longer need to be subsidised			0
‘ it is immoral for hardworking base - rate taxpayers to be lining the pockets of landowners by funding large scale deployment of mature renewables that should n’t need further subsidy			0
‘ piling regressive taxes and green levies on to bills is unfair			0
’ mr @entity96 said green policies are the only part of bills that could be cut , as it is impossible to control world oil and gas prices			0

mr @entity44 said he did not have the power to prevent prices rising again , despite the taxpayer - funded cut in green levies that are used to pay for homes to be insulated			1
‘ they [ energy companies ] are going to have to reduce bills for households compared to what they would have been , ’ he said but households will still face bills rising faster than inflation and critics said the move failed consumers			2
@entity151 , from @entity152 , said she ‘ would not be surprised to see price rises in the coming months and years ’ from ‘ companies that have always put their shareholders ’ returns before the right of their customers to keep warm and healthy ’			1
and miss @entity74 said : ‘ it ’s vital that consumers do not walk away from this thinking that they have a cast - iron guarantee that they are protected from future hikes			2

@entity16 , which transports power and gas around the country , says it needs to spend billions upgrading its networks			1
