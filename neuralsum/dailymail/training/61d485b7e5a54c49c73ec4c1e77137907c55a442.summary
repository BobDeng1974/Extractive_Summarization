by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 these are the first pictures of the tunnel where 12 - year - old @entity5 apparently hid for 11 days while police and @entity8 agents desperately searched for him , fearing he had been murdered			1
@entity5 was discovered hiding behind boxes and a large plastic drum in a tiny basement while his father @entity13 was being interviewed live on national television , appealing for his son ’s safe return			1
since his discovery , @entity5 ’s stepmom has been arrested on gun charges , her two younger children have been taken into care and @entity13 has not been able to see his son as police have taken him to live with his mother			1
the storage closet is to the right , and the exit door , which was oddly left open is further down the corridor hiding out : this is the first picture of the storage closet in the basement of the condominium townhouse where it is believed @entity30 hid out during the eleven days he was missing found : @entity30 was found hiding in his father 's basement after he 'd been missing for 11 days there have been suggestions that abuse charges may be brought by prosecutors and allegations that his father and stepmom may have somehow been involved in his disappearance			1

@entity66 was granted exclusive access to the long corridor that joins all the condos and leads to the outside world			2
the outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men , but crucially last week , it was apparently open so residents could get rid of a build - up of trash in a dumpster left outside			2
that means @entity5 could have left the property in the day , before returning at night			1

‘ i have heard he was seen by some of the local kids playing basketball on at least one occasion			1
the door at the end of the tunnel was open all last week because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster			0

i do n’t know his parents that well , but they seemed like nice people to me			0
’ despite the neighbor ’s assertions , there is still a significant amount of suspicion surrounding @entity5 ’s parents , with many suggesting he would not have been able to stay hidden without an adult ’s involvement			2
stepmom @entity150 was arrested on thursday after apparently violating parole relating to a previous arrest on a gun charge			0
authorities had obtained a warrant for @entity157 's arrest on monday , but held out until thursday to take her into custody later claiming the search for @entity5 took priority			1
