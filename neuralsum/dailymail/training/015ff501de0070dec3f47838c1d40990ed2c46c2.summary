the national civil - rights group @entity1 has launched a new billboard campaign in @entity3 with a play on the @entity5 ’ ‘ i ’m a @entity8 ’ campaign , to promote its upcoming national convention			1
the billboard features a native @entity11 family and reads : ‘ we ’re the @entity16 family , and we ’re @entity1 , ’ with the words ‘ mormons ’ and ‘ ex-mormons ’ crossed out			1
the board , placed in the @entity8 heartland , encourages people to ‘ come explore your doubt with us ’			0
the @entity23 atheists strongly believe that @entity24 should not continue to base their identity in @entity26 @entity1 president @entity27 said : ‘ many atheists still call themselves @entity8 or @entity24			1
our message is this : if you do n’t believe anymore , do n’t continue to base your identity in @entity26			0
‘ you ’re so much more than an “ ex-mormon ” ; you ’re an atheist ! and you are very far from alone			1
be proud to be an atheist - we are , and we want to celebrate being an atheist with you			2
he added : ‘ @entity1 is reaching out to people who are on a journey away from indoctrination , even if they ’re not ready to be open about that			1
strong views : the previous @entity1 billboard was harder hitting the @entity23 @entity44 billboard is based on the ' i 'm a mormon ' ad campaign ‘ countless @entity46 are already free from religion but remain “ in the closet ” about their beliefs			1
they are surrounded by religion and as a result , feel like they are alone			2
‘ the @entity55 will fix that by creating a fun and entertaining atmosphere where atheists from all over the country will meet , learn , and laugh			0
we invite everyone - especially those who have doubts about their religion - to join us			2
’ in designing the ad , @entity1 sought a genuine @entity11 atheist family to appear on the billboard			1
overwhelmed with responses , the group chose the @entity69 of @entity70			0
@entity71 , a sports coach and stay - at - home dad , and his wife , @entity75 , a director in finance , are both atheists who used to identify as @entity24			0
their children , @entity79 and @entity80 , as well as their niece , @entity82 ( of whom @entity83 and @entity75 are guardians ) , are also featured on the billboard			2
@entity82 ’s mother , @entity86 , has accused some atheist groups of needlessly attacking religious organisations and is not entirely supportive of her daughter appearing on the billboard			1
she told the @entity91 that she ’s ‘ not very happy ’ about @entity82 ’s inclusion and added : ‘ i have friends that are atheists … but they ’re not out there knocking our beliefs			0
@entity83 is the type that has to go out and prove a point			0
he ’s always been that kind of person			0
’ however , the latest billboard is considered to be less incendiary than its predecessor , which read ‘ @entity107 is a @entity108			2
the 2014 @entity55 will feature speakers including @entity114 star @entity113 , @entity115 : @entity119 winner @entity118 , and @entity120 - nominated @entity117 bass player @entity116 , all atheists themselves , but none of whom have ever before spoken for an atheist audience			0
other speakers include reverend @entity126 of @entity127 , @entity128 of the @entity129 , popular bloggers @entity130 and @entity132 , and @entity1 president @entity27			1
the billboard is located on the east side of @entity135 , 2500 feet south of @entity136 , facing north .			0
