it affects approximately 15 % of identical twins who share the same placenta			1
one twin is often larger than the other twin and receives more blood than usual from the placenta			2
this can put a strain on the baby 's heart and makes this twin produce more urine than normal , resulting in extra fluid around the baby , within the amniotic sac			0
this can be uncomfortable for the mother and also increases the risk to the pregnancy by causingpremature labour due to the extra pressure on the neck of the womb ( cervix )			0
the other twin is usually smaller and may become anaemic due to receiving less blood from the placenta			2
the treatments for @entity35 pregnancies depend , in part , on when in pregnancy the twins become affected			2
if the twins are mature enough to survive outside the womb ( beyond 25 weeks ) , immediate delivery is an option for @entity35 babies			2
fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other			2
another treatment is amnioreduction - a procedure whereby fluid is taken from around the twin with polyhydramnios to try and prevent premature delivery			0
a needle is passed through the abdomen into the sac of the recipient twin and fluid removed			0
