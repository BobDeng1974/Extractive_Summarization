by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:02 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 09:36 est , 22 may 2013 @entity2 today said he wanted to help people who ‘ work hard ’			0
but politicians again face charges of laziness as they begin another break less than a fortnight since their last commons recess			2
it means that in the first 151 days of 2013 , the commons will have been convened just 67 times			1
rare sight : since the start of the year the @entity11 has sat for fewer than half of the days the parliamentary calendar for the first half of the year reveals how few times commons has sat ( shown in green ) to add to the sense of public outrage , it emerged only this week that @entity22 could be in line for a £ 20,000 pay rise			1
they could take home up to £ 80,000 a year – more than three times the national average – under new recommendations			1
the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , which reports next month , has been looking at an increase of between £ 10,000 and £ 20,000			1
but the lower figure is considered more likely to try and minimise the public backlash , which would take @entity22 ' pay , currently £ 65,738 , up to £ 75,000			1
mr @entity2 has faced repeated criticism from @entity34 for missing several prime minister ’s questions since the start of the year			2
during the space of 12 weeks he will face mps just twice			1
in 2012 - 13 the @entity11 sat just 145 times , the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election			1
some in @entity44 predict it could be even lower this year			1
@entity22 begin their @entity47 recess today and are not due back in @entity44 until june 3			1
it means they have 12 days off , when even most schoolchildren only have a week			2
@entity51 , chief executive of the @entity52 ’ @entity50 , said : ' any mp worth their salt will be hard at work in their constituency during this latest recess			0
' however , another week and a half away from @entity44 means another week and a half during which ministers will get away without being scrutinised in @entity62 by the very people we elect there to hold them to account			1
' week in , week out , we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions , which result in @entity71 being passed by mps without having been subject to detailed scrutiny			0
' this is bad for democracy and mps need to cut down on these recesses in order to allow for more time to be spent in the @entity11 properly debating new laws and holding the government to account			1
' @entity34 accused the government of not having enough policies to sustain debates			0
@entity11 leader @entity84 said : ‘ @entity2 is scared of scrutiny and the government has run out of ideas			2
' it is no wonder we keep going in to recess and that the prime minister has only shown up for prime minister ’s questions once in the last nine weeks			0
' in 2012 - 13 the @entity11 sat just 145 times , one of the lowest figures outside a general election year since january , mps have only had a full five - day week in @entity44 six times			1
they usually spend monday to thursday in @entity62 and then have friday as a ‘ constituency day ’ to attend local events and meet voters			0
the @entity11 had a week off in february for half term			1
it then broke up for 19 days , returning once when @entity62 was recalled for tributes to @entity106			0
@entity2 insisted the government was focusing on repairing the economy the @entity11 then sat for just eight days before breaking again on april 25 , this time for prorogation to prepare for the @entity110 on may 8			1
it meant a bonus 12 days off , before returning for the pomp and ceremony of the @entity114			0
despite setting out more than a dozen major bills , including legislation on reforming social care and pensions , there appears to be no urgency to start debating the laws			0
mr @entity2 today insisted he was focusing on the issues which matter to the public			0
' people want a country which is fair , which is on the side of people who work hard and do the right thing , ' he told @entity129			0
' that ’s got to apply to our immigration system , its got to apply to our welfare system , it ’s got to apply to our schools			0
that is what we must focus on			0
' the @entity11 has been convened just eight times since the @entity110 , before breaking up for the latest recess which will last until june 3			1
the log jam of holidays is caused by the coalition ’s decision to move the @entity110 from the autumn – when the prorogation served as a mini half - term break			1
ministers argue that the @entity11 is sitting more than in the past , because it now routinely returns for two weeks in september			2
the summer recess this year last from july 8 to october 8			0
ahead of the last recess @entity151 , the @entity34 mp who chairs @entity44 ’s spending watchdog , warned the public think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money			2
' we are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times			0
@entity22 have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in recess , ’ she said			2
' members of the public would be forgiven for thinking that it is mps who are lazy and that it is @entity62 that is failing to provide good value for money			0
' we are not spending enough time in @entity44 , and this creates a democratic vacuum			2

@entity22 begin 12 - day @entity174 - *longer* than the school half term break
they only returned to @entity44 two weeks *ago* for the @entity110
since the start of the year the @entity11 has convened just 67 times
mps could be in line for a pay rise of up to £ 20,000
