it has been talked about and hyped - up for more than a year , but a basic evolutionary instinct could end up putting people off buying the new @entity4 @entity3			1
for once it is nothing to do with the price of the wearable technology , but the basic layout of the screen can apparently trigger a sense of ' fear ' in those who are susceptible			1
the hexagonal appearance of the @entity3 's apps on its small screen can cause trypophobia which is a fear of holes			1
until recently , it did n't garner much attention from scientists or doctors			0
however the phenomenon appears to be more widespread than first thought			0
there is a @entity44 group devoted to those who believe they are sufferers			0
according to the website @entity48 , the phobia is a ' weird kind ' and is generally considered as the fear of shapes			2
usually , the fear is caused by shapes created by nature such as the holes in a beehive or the seeds in a pod , but if arranged in the right order , man - made objects such as the @entity3 can also elicit a similar response			1
a number of people have now taken to @entity65 to voice their reaction at seeing the display for the hi - tech device			2
' the @entity4 watch is a cluster of circles no no no no ' , wrote one , whilst another showed a similar reaction : ' anyone else getting a weird trypophobic reaction to the @entity76 ? i 'm sorry i ever learned about that phobia existing ! ' @entity79 : @entity65 is now full of comparisons between the @entity3 and occurrences in nature of weird : many people do not realize they have the phobia until they see an object that triggers the reaction @entity87 found fear ? @entity27 is not recognized as a condition in the @entity91 's @entity90 or other scientific literature @entity4 unveiled the much - anticipated @entity76 on monday			1
the basic watch sells for $ 349 , but other models sell for $ 10,000 and higher			1
a couple of years ago , researchers at the @entity96 conducted research into the phobia			0
it was concluded that it is not the holes that people fear but their brains associating the holes with danger			2
the study suggested the widespread , predominantly latent phobia is associated with ancient threats such as beehives , poisonous flowers and venomous creatures			1
the reaction to these holes is intense			0
' these can make them feel that their skin is crawling , shudder , feel itchy and physically sick when seeing these images because they really find it disgusting and gross			0
some of these people think that something might be living inside those holes and some of them are afraid that they might fall in these holes , ' the website explains			2
despite people trying to convince themselves that there is no danger , not least from a watch , trypophobes have an unconscious reflex reaction that they ca n't control			0
human nature : the holes , or images of holes , stimulate ' a primitive portion of his or her brain that associates the image with something dangerous '			0

*everyday* objects with many *closely* - packed holes can be a trigger for people who report suffering from trypophobia
the *circular* layout of apps on the @entity4 @entity3 can trigger panic attacks
the predominantly latent phobia is associated with ancient threats such as beehives and venous creatures
the @entity3 was launched on monday with prices starting at $ 349
