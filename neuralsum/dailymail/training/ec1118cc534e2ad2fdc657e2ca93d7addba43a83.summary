by @entity0 they lost the tie but they won the right to believe they can hold their own at this level once again			0
on a pulsating night at @entity8 , a stirring @entity10 display briefly threatened to bring the impossible into view			1
three goals down in the tie before the half - hour mark had been reached , @entity16 ’ side could easily have gone searching for the nearest black hole in which to crawl into			1
plenty of @entity20 sides have done so in such circumstances down the years			0
this @entity10 ’ side is made of far sterner stuff , however			1
and when @entity30 and @entity31 scored either side of the break , @entity25 ’s assessment that turning the tie around would be the club ’s greatest @entity28 triumph came to mind			1
dejected : @entity10 trudge off at @entity8 after losing 5 - 2 on aggregate to @entity36 consoling hand : @entity10 boss @entity16 puts an arm round midfielder @entity39 after the game @entity10 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity31 , @entity44 ( low 72 ) , @entity45 , @entity39 , @entity46 , @entity30 ( @entity47 65 ) , @entity48 , @entity49			1
subs not used : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity47 , @entity56			0
goals : @entity30 , @entity31			0
@entity36 : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 43 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 58 ) , @entity70			1
subs not used : @entity72 , @entity59 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75			0
goal : @entity64 ( 2 ) , @entity63			1
they gave it their all and then some more against a side that wheel and deal at levels @entity20 teams can only dream of			2
but the goal that would have presented the grandstand finish to beat them all just never materialised			2
two late , late @entity36 goals to defeat the @entity20 on the night were wounding and frankly undeserved on the balance of play			1
the @entity10 go out but the ovation they received at the game ’s conclusion said it all			1
from @entity94 driftwood two years ago to bloodying @entity36 ’s noses			1
there is much to buoy the men from the @entity98 as the domestic season begins			0
@entity10 had spent a week stewing over a failure to do themselves justice in @entity104 and within four minutes , they ’d subjected the @entity105 to a more stringent examination			1
@entity30 , a peripheral figure in @entity108 , outpaced @entity65 to win a free - kick on the left			1
@entity48 ’s disguised set play picked out @entity46 lurking just inside the box only for the @entity113 to fluff his lines horribly with a fresh - air strike			2
it at least succeeded in bringing the red hordes to their feet			0
a promising start was almost undone by @entity39 ’s misjudgement inside his own box on 10 minutes			0
perhaps blinded by the sun , he rolled his pass - back directly to @entity68			2
only @entity31 ’ positioning on the six - yard line to block the @entity127 ’s shot kept the tie alive			2
double trouble : @entity64 scored twice for the @entity108 side as they won 3 - 2 in @entity20 the movement of the @entity10 ’ attacking quartet – which contained @entity49 rather than @entity133 – troubled the men from @entity135 all night			1
when @entity48 beautifully brought down a long diagonal while playing on the shoulder of his opponent , his delicate chip was just inches over @entity58 ’s bar			0
the @entity10 had the ball in the net soon after when @entity45 slammed home from @entity145 ’s header but the linesman ’s offside flag correctly cut the celebrations short			2
vigilance at the back was imperative to keep the tie alive , though , and @entity16 was thankful for @entity42 ’s bravery to rob @entity68 whilst defending a counter attack one - on - one on the edge of his own box			1
real skipper @entity65 saw yellow for abruptly halting @entity39 ’s burst through the centre			0
yet from @entity36 ’s perspective , it was a price worth paying as they effectively put the tie beyond the @entity10 on 28 minutes			1
thumping header : @entity31 rises highest to give @entity10 fans hope shortly before the hour mark dons roar : the defender celebrates in front of the @entity10 fans after putting them 2 - 1 up on the night after such a heroic start to the game , it was a brutally simple goal to lose			1
@entity65 simply guided an out - swinging corner on to the six - yard box where @entity64 was lurking at the near post			1
one flex of the neck muscles sent his header flashing beyond the helpless @entity41			0
three up in the tie , the job was as good as done			0
commendably , there was no question of the @entity20 folding			0
@entity43 seemed to jump half his height to claim @entity48 ’s corner but , alas , @entity31 was a yard shy of converting as the ball arrowed back across goal			2
@entity42 rattled a 25 - yarder down @entity58 ’s throat then , one minute from the break , came the goal their efforts so richly deserved			2
gathering the ball on the penalty spot , @entity49 juggled it from left foot to right then left again			0
finally , he pulled the trigger only for the out - stretched leg of @entity59 to block			2
@entity30 reacted faster than anyone in blue and white and smashed the ball low into the net			0
on the stroke of half - time , @entity41 ’s block with his legs to deny @entity68 ensured the @entity10 were still in it as they made it to the sanctuary dressing room			1
they were in the @entity105 ’ faces from the re-start although @entity46 lunge on @entity213 came at the cost of a booking			0
breaking hearts : @entity63 scores @entity36 's third goal at @entity8 to make it 5 - 2 on aggregate still the @entity219 surged forward			1
and with fully 33 minutes still on the watch came the goal that rocked @entity8			2
@entity46 ’ corner was claimed by the towering @entity43			0
@entity48 gathered and made for the bye - line , pitching a gem of a ball to the back post where @entity31 applied a sumptuous headed finish			0
@entity47 and @entity54 were called from the bench as @entity229 sought a more direct approach but neither the break of the ball or the moment of magic they craved to put themselves within a goal of victory arrived			0
substitute @entity238 arced a curling effort inches wide of @entity41 ’s goal then missed a pinch from eight yards to ensure the @entity10 kept believing			2
@entity52 was pitched in an emergency centre forward with seven minutes left but the @entity10 could n’t hold back time			1
they were robbed of a deserved win on the night when @entity42 caught @entity244 inside the box with five minutes remaining and @entity64 calmly chipped home from the spot			1
to add insult to injury , @entity248 rose to thump home a header from six yards in stoppage time			0
it was as brave an effort as you could wish to see from a @entity20 side but unfortunately not quite enough			0

the @entity10 had a huge task on their hands after losing 2 - 0 in first leg in @entity108
@entity16 ' side beat @entity269 side @entity268 in the previous round
but @entity36 had too much quality over the course of two legs , winning 5 - 2 on aggregate to grab a spot in the play - off round
@entity64 scored either side of half - time for @entity36 at @entity8
