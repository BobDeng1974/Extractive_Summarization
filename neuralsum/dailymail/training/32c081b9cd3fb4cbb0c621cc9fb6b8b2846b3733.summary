by @entity0 published : 02:07 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 18:16 est , 26 november 2012 it now appears that the fate of @entity3 has been sealed after the maker of @entity5 and @entity6 said late tuesday that it failed to reach an agreement with its second - biggest union			1
as a result , @entity3 plans to continue with a hearing on wednesday in which a bankruptcy court judge in @entity13 , @entity14 , will decide if the company can shutter its operations			1
the renewed talks between @entity3 and @entity18 and @entity19 came after the company declared last week that it would move to wind down its business and start selling off its assets in bankruptcy court			1
failure : last - minute talks between @entity3 and its striking union broke down just hours before a judge is expected to make a decision on whether to allow the company to shutter its operations within hours of friday 's announcement that @entity3 was going out of business , there was a rush on buying their products the company cited a crippling strike that was started on november 9 by the union , which represents 30 per cent of @entity3 workers			1
after making its case to liquidate on monday , the bankruptcy court judge noted that the two sides had n't yet tried resolving their differences through private mediation			1
the judge noted that 18,000 jobs were on the line and urged the company and union to try to resolve their differences			1
both sides agreed to hold mediation proceedings on tuesday			1
‘ many people , myself included , have serious questions as to the logic behind this strike , ’ said judge @entity54 , who heard the case in the @entity56 in the @entity57			2
‘ not to have gone through that step leaves a huge question mark in this case			0
’ in a statement late tuesday , @entity3 said it would not comment on the breakdown in talks other than to say that mediation ‘ was unsuccessful			1
’ a lawyer for the bakers union said he had no comment , citing mediation ground rules			1
@entity3 shut down its three dozen plants late last week after it said the strike by the bakers union hurt its ability to maintain normal production			1
the union said the company 's demise was the result of years of mismanagement , however , and that workers have already given steep concessions over the years			2
@entity3 , weighed down by management turmoil , rising labor costs and @entity90 ' changing tastes , is making its second trip through chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring			1
shortage : @entity95 quickly sold out after news spread that the company was going out of business @entity3 and its striking union have agreed to mediation talks after an intervention by a bankruptcy judge the company , based in @entity104 , @entity105 , had brought on ceo @entity106 as a restructuring expert in part to renegotiate its contract with labor unions			1
the company reached an agreement with its biggest union , the @entity114 , on a contract that dramatically reduced pension contributions , as well as slashing wages and health benefits			2
but the company said the bakers union stopped returning its calls about a month ago			1
the @entity114 urged the smaller union to hold a secret ballot on whether members wanted to continue striking			1
many workers in the bakers union decided to cross picket lines last week but @entity3 said it was n't enough to keep operations at normal levels			1
@entity114 general secretary @entity131 said the failure of the mediation talks tuesday and the likely shuttering of the company was a ' tragic outcome ' for @entity3 workers			1
@entity106 said that @entity3 was already operating on razor thin margins and that the strike was the final blow			1
the bakers union meanwhile pointed to the steep raises executives were given last year as the company was spiraling down toward bankruptcy			1
the company 's announcement last week that it would move to liquidate prompted a rush on @entity3 treats across the country , with many businesses selling out of @entity5 within hours			1
was it all in vain ? on friday @entity153 bought $ 100 worth of @entity3 treats in @entity155 , but now it looks like the company might not go out of business afterall demand : there were long lines outside the @entity3 store in @entity155 when the company announced its demise on friday even if @entity3 goes out of business , its popular brands will likely find a second life after being snapped up by buyers			1
the company says several potential buyers have expressed interest in the brands			2
although @entity3 ' sales have been declining in recent years , the company still does about $ 2.5billion in business each year			2
twinkies alone brought in $ 68million so far this year			0
it 's not the sequence of events that the maker of @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity179 's envisioned when it filed for bankruptcy in january , its second chapter 11 filing in less than a decade			1
the company , who said that it was saddled with costs related to its unionized workforce , had hoped to emerge with stronger financials			0
it brought on @entity106 as a restructuring expert and was working to renegotiate its contract with labor unions			0
but @entity106 was n't able to reach a deal with the bakery union			2
the company , which had been contributing $ 100million a year in pension costs for workers , offered workers a new contract that would 've slashed that to $ 25million a year , in addition to wage cuts and a 17 per cent reduction in health benefits			0
but the bakery union decided to strike			0
outrage : @entity205 , a 33 - year employee of @entity3 , pickets on thursday in @entity206 , @entity207 the quintessential junk food treat - a cream - filled , 150 - calorie sponge cake - has been called the ' cream puff of the proletariat ' and the ' snack with a snack in the middle			1

the defense argued that this behavior was an indication of his instability			0
