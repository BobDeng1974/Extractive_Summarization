by @entity0 a woman was left paralysed and unable to feed herself after doctors failed to realise she had an abscess in her neck			1
@entity5 , 74 , was left partially paralysed and unable to lift her arms shortly before her death in march last year			1
her family say by the time doctors realised what was wrong , it was too late to save her			1
@entity5 was paralysed after doctors failed to diagnosed an abscess in her neck until it was too late they claim she was also left sitting on a soiled chair and that no one responded when she cried out in pain			1
they have instructed solicitors to sue @entity20 , @entity21 , claiming the lack of dignity mrs @entity5 was treated with amounted to a breach of the @entity25			1
her son - in - law @entity26 , 64 , said : ‘ @entity5 was strong , she was feisty and her brain was working 100 per cent			2
‘ if she had been given the right treatment and care , she would n’t have gone the way she went			0
’ shortly after mrs @entity5 retired in 2000 , she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy			1
but the cancer returned and spread to her spine , leaving her prone to suffering falls			2
mrs @entity5 was admitted to @entity20 after a fall			1
she had breast cancer that had spread to her spine mr @entity26 , of @entity38 , @entity21 , said she would usually be checked over in hospital after a fall and released within a day			1
but after she was taken from her @entity42 home to @entity20 in mid-january 2013 , her family decided to start looking at care homes she could move into			1
however , he claims the lack of care and attention his mother - in - law received at the hospital meant she deteriorated rapidly and was never able to leave			1
he said : ‘ she was put in a seat in the mornings and just left there			0
throughout that period , she was getting worse and worse			0
‘ she complained of a pain in her neck and in that time of sitting there an abscess formed in her neck , which eventually paralysed her			1
‘ she could n’t even raise her arms to eat her food and they would just take it away			2
‘ she was left in her bed soiled and she was left in her seat soiled			2
you would n’t treat a dog like she was treated			0
’ mr @entity26 , a retired @entity66 director , and his wife @entity67 , 51 , visited every day and said they would have to feed her themselves			0
he added : ‘ @entity67 went up there one day with a friend			0
‘ they walked in and @entity5 was in such neck pain , she was screaming out			2
the lady opposite said she was crying out all through the night and no one came			0
‘ all they used to do was put her in a private room because she was keeping the other patients awake			0
’ on march 5 2013 , @entity26 and mrs @entity80 were told mrs @entity5 had a suspected abscess			1
doctors told them she was too frail to survive treatment and had only days to live			0
however , that night they received a call telling them mrs @entity5 was being taken to @entity88 ’s @entity87 for surgery			1
ms @entity5 's family say staff at the hospital left her sitting in soiled clothes , that they did n't help her to eat when she was too ill to feed herself and that they did not respond when she cried out in pain mr @entity26 contacted @entity97 ’s and was told when she arrived they almost immediately realised she was too weak to deal with the anaesthetic			1
mrs @entity5 was sent back to @entity20 , where she died that afternoon			1
mr @entity26 said they had an initial meeting with doctors who admitted they should have spotted the abscess sooner and should not have sent her to @entity97 ’s			2
afterwards , he wrote to former chief executive dr @entity104 to express his anger , and received a letter back offering a meeting			0
he refused and got in touch with @entity110 solicitors			0
ten months on , mr @entity26 said his wife , who has needed time off work , was still too upset and angry to speak about her mother ’s care			0
mrs @entity5 's family are now taking legal action against @entity20 the couple are now pursuing legal action			1
he said : ‘ we could just sit on this and let it go , but people should know about this			0
‘ at the end of the day , @entity20 could go on doing exactly the same thing			2
‘ i hope the hospital gets its act together			0
it ’s not going to happen overnight , but they must take some responsibility for the pain and suffering that they have given to patients and their families			0
’ a spokesman for @entity20 said : ‘ we would like to pass on our sympathy and concerns to the family of this patient following her death in march last year , and are sorry and disappointed that they have concerns			2
‘ we received a complaint about this patient shortly after her death , which was investigated as a serious incident			0
‘ one of her consultants met the patient ’s daughter and son - in - law and apologised to the patient ’s family for some aspects of her care			0
