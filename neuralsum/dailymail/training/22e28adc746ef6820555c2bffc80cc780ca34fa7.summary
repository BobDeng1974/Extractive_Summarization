by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 09:42 est , 4 september 2013 @entity1 is set to unveil its @entity2 in @entity3 on wednesday , but doom - saying analysts are already predicting poor sales and a lack of enthusiasm for the technology			1
the @entity10 company will be the first major smartphone manufacturer to release a device that resembles a smartphone worn on the wrist , although other , similar devices such as the @entity16 and @entity17 are already on sale			0
by being the first to launch , @entity1 will beat @entity19 's @entity20 - rumoured to be coming out in @entity21 next year - to the market , yet experts are divided on whether this gives it an advantage or poses a risk			1
the gear comes preloaded with @entity33 apps for tracking fitness , health and connecting with social networks as well as call logs when synced with a smarpthone rumours about a @entity1 smartwatch began towards the end of last year and earlier this month a patent filing for the @entity1 gadget was uncovered			2
according to the filing @entity1 's @entity45 range will be ' wearable digital electronic devices in the form of a wristwatch , wrist band or bangle capable of providing access to the @entity52 and for sending and receiving phone calls			1
' it continued that the wristband will also be used for ' storage and / or transmission of data and messages and for keeping track of or managing personal information ; smart phones ; tablet computers ; portable computers			0
' images leaked by technology site @entity67 claims to show a prototype @entity45 , pictured with a 3 - inch touchscreen			1
the site also claims it has a @entity72 camera in the strap , voice commands , preloaded @entity33 apps for tracking fitness , health and connecting with social networks as well as call logs when synced with an @entity33 phone			0
engineer and tech expert @entity81 from @entity83 told @entity84 : ' as far as timing goes , it is everything			0
it wo n't be easy for many rivals to bring out a competitor watch a few months from now based on the lessons learnt from the @entity45			2
' they can make adjustments , but you can hardly expect a whole new product			0
@entity19 are @entity96 at the moment ; you either love them or hate them			2
' most @entity33 fans fall in the latter category , and they 'll probably go straight for anything that comes with the @entity1 badge on it			2
' @entity102 , an analyst at research firm @entity103 , told @entity104 : ' in @entity103 's device forecast we have an assumption built into our model that says that less than 3 percent of consumers replacing their smartphone will replace it with a smartwatch in 2017			2
' she added that although the device will set @entity1 and @entity19 apart , the take up is likely to be slow			1
other analysts have claimed that the technology wo n't become mainstream until @entity19 launches its own version of the device : ' it worked for the @entity119 , and it worked with smartphones ( the @entity121 ) as well , so there may be some calculated truth to this prediction , ' continued @entity81			1
this has been dubbed by @entity126 , research manager at @entity127 , as waiting for an ' @entity129 moment ' - where the market needs to be ready for a device and the hardware , software and design is just so to make the gadget popular and far reaching			0
the official @entity45 looks similar to this 2009 concept of a @entity1 smart watch , designed by @entity138			1
the firm 's mobile bosses confirmed in march it was working on a watch and the company 's executive vice president confirmed the @entity45 name in august rumours about a @entity1 smartwatch began towards the end of last year and earlier this month a patent filing for the @entity1 gadget was uncovered			1
according to the filing , @entity1 's @entity45 range will be ' wearable digital electronic devices in the form of a wristwatch , wrist band or bangle capable of providing access to the @entity52 and for sending and receiving phone calls			1
' it continued that the wristband will also be used for ' storage and / or transmission of data and messages and for keeping track of or managing personal information ; smart phones ; tablet computers ; portable computers			0
' @entity170 , executive vice president of @entity1 ’s mobile business , told @entity172 last week : ‘ we will be introducing a new wearable concept device called @entity45 at our own event in @entity3 on sept. 4			1
’ however , he admitted the first version wo n't have , as predicted by many experts , a flexible display			1
‘ the @entity179 wo n’t have a flexible display			1
the new device will enhance and enrich the current smart mobile experience in many ways			0
it will lead a new trend in smart mobile communications			0
’ images leaked by technology site @entity67 confirm this solid screen			2
the images purport to be of a prototype @entity45 sent to developers and partners			2
it has a 3 - inch touchscreen , a @entity72 camera in the strap , voice commands , a handful of preloaded @entity33 apps for tracking fitness , health and connecting with social networks as well as call logs when synced with an @entity33 phone			0
@entity19 is believed to have 100 people working on its @entity20 , according to recent rumours , but is hiring new members because the existing team have been unable to solve issues with the design and engineering			1
here is @entity214 's mock - up of what the @entity20 could look like experts believe both technology giant 's watches will link to mobile phones and offer largely similar functions , such as the ability to show emails and download mini apps			1
' we ’ve been preparing the watch product for so long , ' @entity170 , executive vice president of @entity1 ’s mobile business , told @entity227 during an interview in @entity229			2
' we are working very hard to get ready for it			0
we are preparing products for the future , and the watch is definitely one of them			0
' the issue here is who will first commercialise it so consumers can use it meaningfully , ' young - hee also hinted that more wearable gadgets were in the pipeline			0
‘ we have intellectual properties for patents related to the next wearable devices			0
those are concepts for future products			0
’ the gadget will also compete against @entity252 's @entity251 wearable computer , which is expected to go on sale to the public next year			0
@entity1 is also expected to launch a new version of its note ‘ phablet ’ - a combined phone and tablet - at the event			1
@entity1 announced earlier this year it is ' investing heavily ' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health			0
@entity1 's watch concept , pictured , shows a solid wooden band , and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running , for example shares in both @entity1 and @entity19 have taken a hit as the world 's top two mobile device manufacturers keep underwhelming consumers with their latest smartphone models			1
@entity1 shares dropped nearly 5 percent , or around $ 10 billion , in just two trading sessions after it launched its @entity279 smartphone in march , partly hit by concerns that its flagship product lacks the ' wow factor ' and may not live up to expectations			0
the @entity284 , unwrapped to much fanfare in @entity286 to challenge @entity19 's @entity121 on its home turf , offered some incremental evolutionary improvements , but media reports have since suggested these features may not be sufficient to excite buyers in an industry that lives and dies by innovation			1
the global watch industry is expected to generate more than $ 60 billion in sales this year , and rather like the mobile phone market , firms are expected to try and ' lock ' consumers into their own ecosystem of apps and other downloads			0
@entity1 became the world ’s largest smartphone maker last year , overtaking @entity19			1
@entity1 had 29 percent of global smartphone unit shipments in the fourth quarter , compared with 21 percent for @entity19 .			2

the @entity45 smartwatch is set to launch in @entity3 this wednesday
leaked images suggest the first version will not have a flexible display
@entity1 's launch will beat @entity19 's rumoured @entity20 but analysts predict a slow take up of the technology
