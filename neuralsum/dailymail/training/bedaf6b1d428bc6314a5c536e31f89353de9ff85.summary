not so long ago , it was more acceptable to smoke next to a baby than it was to sport a coat made from fox , mink or chinchilla			0
such was public disgust , those who did venture out in a pelt were likely to find themselves deluged with red paint			0
but how times have changed			0
once taboo , fur is now a regular sight on the catwalk , with labels such as @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 using it in their collections			1
at the @entity24 last week , race - goers turned up swathed in expensive mink and raccoon coats , while on the red carpet , a-listers such as @entity28 and @entity29 are as happy to strike a pose in a fur as they are in lace			1
so what does that mean for the rest of us ? is fur now ok to wear ? @entity40 fashion : pelts on the catwalk at @entity43 during @entity44 and sported by @entity28 ( right ) no , say @entity45 [ @entity45 ] , who point to a recent @entity48 poll which found that 95 per cent of @entity50 women say they would n't wear fur			1
' we may see more fur on the catwalk but that does n't translate into what real people are wearing , unless they are the sort of people who would elbow aside a starving child on their way to kicking a stray dog , ' said @entity45 founder , @entity63			1
in a jibe at fashionable fur wearers , she added : ' fur is now so cheap that streetwalkers wear it and wage labourers in @entity69 can have fur slippers			2
' but @entity63 's view does n't match up with figures released by the @entity73 , which show that domestic fur sales increased by a healthy 30 per cent between 2010 and 2011			1
globally , sales are just as buoyant and have almost tripled since 2000			1
' fur sales are at a record high , with global sales of all types of fur increasing by 70 per cent to around $ 15 billion in the past decade , ' says @entity80 , ceo of the @entity81			1
' the boom is thanks to high demand from the @entity85 and @entity86 but also due to designers reinventing fur as a material			2
' none of this comes as a surprise to @entity93 , ceo of @entity94 , the @entity96 body that manages sales for the country 's fur farmers			1
wrapped up : @entity100 sports a fur hat to watch the races during the @entity24 fashionable : furs on the catwalk at the @entity94 show during @entity105 for @entity108 , quality and longevity are the main reasons for fur 's continuing appeal , but he is keen to point out that fur is an eco-friendly material too			1
' real fur is a green choice , ' he explains			2
' @entity117 is the most polluting industry in the world and it 's really not very green			0
' @entity120 demands lots of pesticides and pollutes a lot but lasts for only half a year as a piece of clothing			0
fur is expensive so you wo n't just throw it away			1
it can last for ever - perhaps 10 , 15 , 20 years or more			0
' controversial though @entity93 's views might seem , they are n't unusual			2
writing in @entity132 , fashion author and curator , @entity131 revealed : ' i wear leather , i eat meat			0
i do n't feel there is much difference ethically			2
unless you are wearing a hemp sack , you run the risk of flaunting something unethical in your wardrobe			2
' synthetic fibres are potentially controversial , given the raw materials and processes used in production , while cheap , fast fashion often has questionable labour conditions and encourages waste			0
' ' we do n't have a problem with fur coming back into fashion , ' add @entity157 designers , @entity158 and @entity159			1
' we do n't think for a lot of people it ever went away			1
' we eat meat and use and wear leather which essentially is skin with hair removed , so it would be contradictory to say otherwise			0
' @entity93 , meanwhile , is also keen to address the issue of fur farming , which is legal in @entity96 , but is the main bone of contention for @entity50 consumers			2
' fur farming banned in some countries , including your own [ @entity50 ] but it is n't because of welfare : it is because of public morality , ' he says			1
' if the [ @entity50 ] government looked at reports that compared animal welfare on fur farms to pig farming or something like that , they 'd find they would n't want to ban it			1
' in @entity96 , the conclusion is that welfare on fur farms is better than welfare on regular farms			1
' no change : fur has never gone away say @entity157 designers , @entity158 and @entity159 @entity194 included an ermine cape in the latest show shaggy furs dominated the catwalk at @entity199 @entity200 sports a fur coat during @entity204 's @entity203 show trends too have played a part , with many designers fed up with the poor quality of faux fur , while outside of the fashion industry , a new generation have discovered real fur through purchasing vintage coats and trims			1
' fur coats are the lightest , warmest , wind - blocking garment you can own , ' adds @entity131			2
' completely insulating without being bulky or heavy			0
' fur is becoming an increasingly common sight in the celebrity world too			2
tellingly , of the five supermodels who posed for @entity45 's ' i 'd rather go naked than wear fur ' campaign of the 90s , only @entity221 still avoids fur			1
the others , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity28 and @entity231 , all wear it			1
even animal rights activists are n't having the same impact that they once did			2
' the growth figures of the fur trade just show pretty clearly that consumers are growing increasingly cold to the animal rights debate , ' says @entity80			1
' animal rights activists are still shouting as loud as before , but people are choosing not to listen			2
' pop stars and actresses , such as @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 , wear their fur proudly and brave the onslaught of ferocious attacks from animal welfare organisations like @entity45			1
' there will always be vegetarians , people opposed to nuclear weapons : that ’s fine , that 's what healthy democracy is about			0
' @entity45 , however , has no plans to give up on its fight against fur and recently recruited actress @entity263 to voice its new campaign video			1
furry : real fur hats were seen all over the @entity24 , on men as well as women fur fans : @entity269 slips out for a midnight snack in her fur coat , while @entity272 wore hers to a party ' stylish celebrities , including @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , abhor the cruelty of the fur trade , ' ripostes @entity63			1
and it is n't just celebrities who 've sworn off the textile			1
although fur is popping up increasingly regularly on the catwalk , most recently at @entity204 , for some , the material will never be acceptable			1
@entity289 is one designer for whom pelts just do n't pay , telling @entity132 that ' everything in my store and every single garment and accessory that you see is cruelty free in the sense that no animal has died to make anything in here			0
' and she 's not alone			0
sir @entity304 's @entity303 , which includes @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 and @entity314 have all pledged not to sell fur			0
meanwhile , @entity96 designer @entity316 has also sworn off the material , despite hailing from a culture in which fur is generally regarded as just another fabric			0
' nowadays you can get material that has the same structure and feel as real fur , ' he explains			0
' there 's no need for us to use real fur			0
for me , fake [ fur ] is a better choice			0
' another fashionista who wo n't touch fur is fashion writer @entity334 , partner of @entity335 , @entity336 , who says : ' i do n't believe an animal existing in a tiny cage for its lifespan purely to be made into a coat or used as trimming is morally acceptable for me			1
' for @entity45 , however , the fashion institution that really is n't pulling its weight is @entity346 , which recently ran into trouble over the use of peacock feathers on its £ 22,000 show stopper of a coat first seen during the label 's @entity353 show			1
@entity355 : @entity346 's controversial feather trench on the runway ( left ) and on @entity358 ( right ) ' the @entity346 brand may be known for its plaids but what it should be known for is a long track record of promoting cruelty to animals , including drowning , strangling and electrocuting animals on factory fur farms and now paying to have feathers ripped out of peacocks ' sensitive skin by the fistful , ' thunders @entity63			1
' the rising demand for peacock feathers , fuelled by heartless designers , translates to the trapping and slaughter of @entity377 's prized national bird			0
' anyone with an ounce of compassion should steer clear of these products of cruelty and instead opt for any of the many fashionable options that does n’t cost animals the skin ( or feathers ) off their backs			0
' @entity346 has responded by pointing out that the peacock feathers come from @entity69 , not @entity377 , and are sustainably sourced			0
what 's more they say , fur accounts for less than one per cent of their business			0
@entity346 's ethical policy reads : ' as a luxury brand there will be limited occasions when fur is considered important to the overall design but we insist that as with any animal product , it must be sourced without inflicting cruelty			0
' specifically , our policy prescribes the sourcing of fur from suppliers that are governed by high animal welfare standards , which limits the types and origins of furs used in our collection			2
' in addition , @entity346 believes in the accurate labelling of all garments containing fur , to clearly inform consumers about the product prior to their purchase			0
as a result , @entity346 is a signatory to the @entity422 government 's @entity420			0
' @entity80 and @entity108 's take on sourcing fur mirrors @entity346 's , with both pointing out that the fabric is often a by - product of the meat industry			0
@entity80 is also keen to mention that fur from endangered species is outlawed under the @entity430 ( @entity431 ) regulation and says that the industry would never use fur from domestic cats and dogs			1
the big question for consumers is who to believe			0
are we to listen to @entity45 or to @entity80 ? ultimately , it 's a matter of choice			2
but whether you do decide to wear fur or not , it 's worth thinking carefully before you splash out on that luxe mink coat			0
