it 's a christmas tree like no other			1
towering at 7ft tall , the creation was put together by takeaway bosses @entity4 and @entity5			1
the @entity6 is made from 50kgs of potatoes , 20 loaves of bread and 22 baps , and is on display at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the 7ft high christmas tree is made from 50kgs of potatoes , 20 loaves of bread and a further 22 baps			1
it is the brainchild of takeaway boss @entity21 ( pictured ) who runs @entity23 in @entity14 , @entity15 the couple , who were also behind battered @entity26 doughnuts and the world 's tallest burger , made the creation to spread festive cheer			1
after taking a photo , the takeaway bosses decided to hand out their sandwiches to punters free of charge			1
however , interested customers could buy the work of art for £ 160			1
the tree stands so tall that 54 - year - old mr @entity21 had to forgo the star on the top			1
mrs @entity5 , 50 , said : ' we always like to do something a little bit unusual , and we had a good vibe about this			0
@entity46 treats with a twist : @entity48 with mister @entity13 's battered mince pies ' we were trying to think of a catchy names for it but is is basically a @entity46 - tree shaped chip butty			1
' it 's common place to do battered @entity46 mince pies and puddings now and so we thought we would put that on its head but still do something in keeping with festivities			2
' when making it we had to act quick - we were really busy shovelling the chips into the butties , it took an hour to build			0
we would have gone higher but it would have gone through the ceiling			0
' the customers are not shocked by what we do anymore			0
they like it and enjoy seeing what we 'll come up with next			0
' the couple are famous for their wacky culinary creations including battered @entity77 ( pictured ) record - breaking attempt : the pie - scraper was created earlier this year and stood up at 5ft 4inches tall			2
it was filled with bacon butties , pies , pizzas and spaghetti @entity84 ' it 's definitely not your standard chip butty like what we usually sell for £ 1.85			2
i think people felt a bit bad eating it because it looked so amazing stood next to the window for everyone to see			0
it 's been a real success in the run up to @entity46			2
' but mrs @entity5 is reluctant to reveal how the potato tree keeps vertical			0
' it 's not got a rod down the middle like most people think but there is a support system in place			0
' a lot of preparation goes into it before it is built and @entity4 is the creative one			0
we did decide to steer clear of sauces though just in case it got a bit too messy			0

@entity21 's tree stands tall in mister @entity120 , @entity14 , @entity15
50kg potatoes , 20 loaves of bread and 22 baps went into the creation
