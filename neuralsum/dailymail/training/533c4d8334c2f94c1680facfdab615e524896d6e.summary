they 're often regarded as supermen , but the sporting world has been reminded in no uncertain terms this week that footballers are as heartbreakingly human and fragile as the rest of us			0
the news that @entity10 winger @entity9 is battling testicular cancer , and cried when he received the diagnosis , will have touched even the toughest of souls these past few days			1
none will have understood more what he is going through than @entity18 manager @entity17			1
he survived the same condition twice , having first been diagnosed following a routine medical check when he was a @entity21 player in the late 1990s			0
@entity10 's @entity9 revealed that he has been battling testicular cancer this week while his thoughts naturally go out to @entity24 , who is back in his native @entity26 following emergency surgery , @entity17 has also been giving more direct assistance to a young man recovering from cancer closer to home this week			1
the @entity33 boss is an advocate of keeping positive in such trying circumstances , and revealed yesterday that he has been offering help and advice to @entity38 player @entity37 following the @entity41 youngster ’s own battle for survival			1
@entity37 , still just 20 , was told he was suffering from melanoma skin cancer during a loan spell with @entity45 and has shown remarkable maturity and courage to fight back , mercifully being given the all - clear several months ago			1
however , with mental and physical scars that would unsettle a man twice his age , it was encouraging to hear he has been benefitting from an understanding ear and some sage wisdom			0
@entity17 , a close friend of @entity10 boss @entity55 , said : ‘ i got a phone - call from @entity38 and they have a young lad [ @entity37 ] who was diagnosed with skin cancer			1
i was asked to go through and speak to him			0
‘ from that point of view he will be fine , however he is having to deal with a lot at such a young age and being open and speaking to people can be difficult			0
‘ the diagnosis will take you to dark places and the mind - set will be : you think you are going to die			0
@entity18 manager @entity17 survived cancer while a professional footballer ‘ it gives you a real vulnerability and you do think : “ what if ? ” when you are by yourself you do think : “ is this the end ? ” when you feel a different pain you imagine it to be somewhere else			1
‘ he needs to be as positive as he can , ’ added 42 - year - old @entity17 , who has become an inspiration to many sportspeople after writing candidly on the topic in his autobiography , how @entity83			2
‘ the boy is going through a tough time at the moment and we had a chat and it was good for him psychologically just to bounce off someone and speak abut things			0
’ @entity37 , thankfully , is at the end of his journey back to full health and he continues to do admirable work in the field of raising awareness regarding the illness , belying his tender years			1
however , @entity10 stalwart @entity9 is at the start of his own battle with cancer			1
the 31 - year - old fans ’ favourite , who has been at @entity106 for six years , has had his left testicle removed after the discovery of a tumour and is currently undergoing chemotherapy			0
although not acquainted with him personally , @entity17 knows the man by reputation and admires his tireless playing style and character			2
and he is certain that tenacity will serve @entity9 well as he embarks on a bid to survive an increasingly beatable illness			2
‘ we have made giant strides since i was diagnosed with testicular cancer , ’ @entity17 continued			1
‘ if you are going to get cancer then testicular cancer is the one you want because of the high success rate			1
@entity38 's @entity37 fought back after suffering from melanoma skin cancer ‘ there is a 95 per cent success rate and if anybody gave you those odds in whatever battle you were facing you would grab it with both hands			1
‘ @entity134 thoughts will go through @entity9 ’ head , but he will have the best care and he needs to stay close and have his family around him and stay strong			2
‘ you only have to look at other people who have gone through similar situations - there is light at the end of the tunnel			0
if the diagnosis is good then the outcome will be positive for him			0
‘ hopefully they will have found out quick enough and it wo n’t be long before we see @entity9 back on the pitch fighting fit			2
he looks a tough character and determined guy			0
‘ he is the sort of guy you can kick but will get up and keep coming back at you ! if he takes that mentality with the illness i have no doubt he will beat it			2
’ amid an admirably candid discussion with @entity17 , it was easy to forget that his @entity18 side have a big game this weekend as they try to keep pace with @entity162 and @entity163 in the bid to return to the @entity165			1
thankfully @entity166 was on hand to emphasise the importance - albeit one that was given a new sense of perspective by the week ’s events - of their trip to face @entity174 this afternoon			0
‘ we have been too easy to score against and we are working on that as a team , ’ added the young defender following last week ’s thrilling 3 - 2 win over @entity177			0
‘ but we are scoring goals , so you take the good with the bad and try to find the right balance			0
