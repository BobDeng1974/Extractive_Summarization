by @entity0 former @entity2 captain @entity1 has admitted he was wrong to suggest @entity3 should be replaced as the leader of the national side			1
@entity1 was one of a number of former @entity2 captains turned media pundits to criticise @entity3 in the wake of the humbling defeat to @entity11 at @entity12 in the second @entity13			1
@entity1 , who led @entity2 to @entity14 glory in 2005 , believed @entity3 should have been stood down as captain and given a six - month break from cricket in order to feel refreshed for a busy schedule next year			1
' no question , i was wrong , ' said @entity1 on @entity38 5 live 's the @entity39 and @entity40			2
' two and a half weeks ago , i said a break would 've done him good			0
' but the @entity42 stood by him , he was strong and said : " i 'm the man to carry this young team forward			0
'' @entity3 responded to questions over his form with knocks of 95 and 70 not out in @entity47			0
jumping for joy : @entity2 bowler @entity49 leaps into the air after sealing victory in the fourth test however , he was given a major let - off in his first innings when he was put down on 15 by @entity55 , a reprieve that @entity1 thinks altered the momentum in the five - @entity13 series			1
@entity1 said : ' i think that one catch is the real twist of the whole series			2
' if @entity55 had caught @entity3 on 15 , i really felt at that time , it would 've been a disaster for the side			0

@entity1 said @entity3 should take a break after @entity2 's defeat to @entity11 in the second test at @entity12
the former @entity2 captain has now retracted his comments
he believes @entity3 has proved his *qualities* as captain after @entity2 took a 2 - 1 lead in the series
