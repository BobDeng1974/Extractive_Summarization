but the side boob 's days could be numbered as more and more a-listers switch to another revealing trend : the ' bum slip '			1
unlike the classic builder 's bum , a bum slip occurs when a pair of too - short shorts or a micro skirt is worn , with the result that the lower part of the derriere is on show			1
revealing : @entity19 shows how the ' bum slip ' is done in a sheer sequinned catsuit during a @entity23 party once a sartorial no - no , the bum slip is swiftly overtaking the side boob as the red carpet flash of choice , with everyone from @entity30 to @entity31 getting in on the act			1
ever the early adopter , @entity19 was one of the first to be seen flashing her rear in public when she attended @entity36 's party at the @entity37 during @entity38			1
the 39 - year - old mother of one arrived at the soir√©e sporting a bizarre black net catsuit and tuxedo jacket combo by @entity45 , which covered her top half but left her backside exposed			2
her catwalk colleagues have also given the revealing look their seal of approval with @entity52 sending @entity53 down the catwalk at @entity55 wearing a skimpy pair of pink silk shorts - with just a coat to spare her blushes			0
in @entity60 , @entity31 was spotted running errands in a pair of @entity63 that left absolutely nothing to the imagination , while @entity66 appeared on the red carpet in a dress with a gargantuan bow in place of a skirt that barely covered her behind			0
fashionable : @entity53 shows of shorts guaranteed to provide a bum slip during the @entity55 show what will @entity76 say ! @entity31 does the bum slip in a pair of ultra short @entity63 red carpet ready ? @entity66 's bottom - scraping ' dress ' has a large bow instead of a skirt although the bum slip has n't been doing the red carpet round for long , it has made more regular appearances on stage			1
@entity88 , @entity30 and @entity89 all have form on the derriere flashing front , with @entity30 's micro shorts and @entity89 's carnivalesque costumes leaving little covered up			2
both have been known to tackle the trend offstage , as has @entity96 , whose passion for teeny tiny denim shorts has left her rear on show on more than one occasion			0
even @entity30 's friend @entity102 has tapped into the trend , although on some occasions - most noticeably at the @entity104 - she 's come slightly too close for comfort to the traditional builder 's bum			0
while pregnancy has curtailed @entity111 's more risque fashion choices , the star has n't given up on flashing the flesh , although in her case , it was more inadvertent than intentional			0
photographed heading to the gym in a pair of too - tight leggings , @entity111 's version of the bum slip was more full moon than sexy glimpse			2
bummed out : @entity88 lets loose a bum slip on stage while wearing a tiny white skater skirt naughty : @entity30 demonstrates the bum slip in a sheer top and thigh high boots on stage in @entity130 short and sweet : @entity96 ' skirt is so tiny , it fails to cover her rear and results in a bum slip do n't try this at home ! @entity111 's inadvertent take on the bum slip was more full moon			1

the bum slip involves flashing the bottom half of the backside
