@entity0 , pictured with now seven - month - old @entity1 , who claims she was told breastfeeding was not a reason for her to avoid jury duty a mother who asked to be excused from jury duty because she is breastfeeding claims she has had her application declined because she can still ' use a bottle '			1
the comment , said to have been made by an official at @entity12 , @entity13 , has been condemned by breastfeeding campaigners as ' appalling '			1
@entity0 , 39 , was cited for jury service when her first - born , @entity1 , was only a few weeks old			1
she claims she filled in a form asking for an exemption , but received a letter to say she was still to attend court on march 16			1
the @entity13 resident then rang to explain that she was still breastfeeding her seven - month - old , but was told that was not a reason to miss jury duty because she could ' use a bottle '			1
that would mean leaving @entity1 , her first child , at home and either feeding him with enough expressed milk to last at least a week or switching to formula			0
however , a @entity30 spokesperson claimed no formal application had been received , and to state it was denied on the grounds of breastfeeding was ' incorrect '			1
the situation leaves mrs @entity0 in limbo after she claims court staff on the phone told her to send away a medical certificate by her doctor			1
despite doing this , she said she has yet to receive a response and is expected to attend the court hearing			1
she said : ' i was surprised when they told me that i had to provide a doctor 's note			1
' breastfeeding is not an illness or a medical condition , so why use up precious surgery time getting @entity52 to write up notes in such circumstances ? ' health services are doing everything they can to promote breastfeeding , so it does not make sense for the court service to make things more difficult			1
' there does n't seem to be any consistency			0
i have friends who have called up to say they were breastfeeding and were excused , whereas others have had the same issues as me			1
' she added : ' in my case , i do not have the option of expressing and giving him milk in a bottle because he simply wo n't take it			2
i do n't even have a breast pump			0
' there would be the issue of childcare as well			0
i 'm currently on maternity leave so somebody would have to look after him			0
he is fed about five times a day so even if he took milk from a bottle it would be almost impossible for me to express that amount if i was on jury duty			1
' she said there needed to be ' clearer guidelines ' set in place to prevent this from reoccurring			0
she said : ' i understand there is a need to encourage citizens to help the legal process but this should not be at the expense of what is an important public health issue			0
@entity0 said her son @entity1 needed to be fed about five times a day so even if he took milk from a bottle it would be impossible for her to express that amount while on a jury she said the ' appalling ' comment was made by an official at @entity12 , @entity13 ( pictured ) ' there needs to be clearer guidelines on this			1
surely they should just look at a baby 's date of birth and realise that they will be too young to leave			0
' i think mothers with children under the age of one should be exempt from the service			2
' the news was universally condemned by those who support breastfeeding mothers			2
@entity123 of the international charitable breastfeeding support organisation @entity124 , said the situation was appalling and being told to give a bottle showed a complete lack of understanding			1
she said : ' for one thing the mother 's health would be put at risk because of the danger of mastitis from not feeding and her milk supply would be disrupted			0
' many breastfed babies will not take a bottle and in addition , will be very distressed in being away from their mothers			2
@entity0 said there needed to be clearer guidelines on new mothers ' responsibilities on juries ' we would agree that the needs of a baby to be breastfed should always be paramount and that this need to be made clear			1
' mothers are , in effect , being told they must withhold their babies ' food from them - and this would be considered completely unacceptable in any other circumstances			2
' @entity155 , senior policy advisor with the @entity156 , added : ' if a mother decides to breastfeed her baby , the judicial system needs to respect her choice			0
' society needs to do much more to support women in their feeding decisions			0
' a @entity30 spokesman said : ' no formal application has yet been received			1
it is completely incorrect to say that the application has been declined on the grounds of breastfeeding			1
' @entity12 was contacted by a potential juror advising that she was breastfeeding and unable to do jury service			1
' she was advised about jurors being excused for medical grounds who take preference and to contact her surgery and obtain something in writing			2
' the right for automatic excusal from jury service is listed in statute			1
anyone else wishing to be excused is normally asked to submit their reasons to the court for consideration and to include any relevant supporting documentation for consideration			0
' @entity191 will then consider those applications sympathetically but in some circumstances the court may not be able to excuse individuals where to do so would prejudice the conduct of court business			0
' it is not our policy to request a medical certificate to support a request for excusal on the grounds of breastfeeding			1
' the spokesman said the court had an appropriate room available for those who required privacy in order to breastfeed			0
according to the @entity214 of 2010 , it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding			2
however , the incident comes after mother @entity217 , 35 , was asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in @entity221 ’s hotel in december last year			0
the mother of three was left humiliated after staff at the five - star @entity220 gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12 - week - old daughter @entity226 during afternoon tea in december last year			0
@entity217 , 35 , was breastfeeding her 12 - week - old baby ( left ) at the luxury @entity230 's hotel in @entity220 in december last year , when waiters asked her to cover up with a large napkin ( right ) to avoid ' causing offence ' to fellow guests mrs @entity236 , who is married to comedy actor @entity237 , was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid ' causing offence ' , but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards			1
at the time , she said : ‘ i was really shocked as i had never experienced this before			0
through my tears i tried to explain that i was really quite cross			0
' she criticised the hotel ’s ‘ @entity244 ’ policy and the incident led to a mass breastfeeding protest outside the five - star @entity220			2
the demonstration , organised by @entity249 to feed - which campaigns for the ' normalising ' of public breastfeeding - saw dozens of mothers brave freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel 's grand front doors and feed their infants			2
protest : a group of about 40 mothers took part in a demonstration outside the five star @entity220 following the incident classical musician @entity262 was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into the exclusive @entity263 in central @entity264 , because no under 12s were allowed in			0
she had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played @entity270 ’s @entity269 in g major at the exclusive club			2
instead , the babysitter had to wait outside the venue in december last year , with @entity275 and @entity276 , 34 , had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby			0
classical musician @entity262 was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into an exclusive @entity264 hotel meanwhile in august @entity281 , 29 , from @entity282 , @entity283 , was told by a lifeguard at @entity285 that she could not breastfeed her five - month - old daughter @entity286 because it was ' classed as eating and drinking '			2
in june 2014 , a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant			2
@entity295 , 27 , was left feeling ' embarrassed and ashamed ' after staff at @entity297 in @entity298 suggested she move while feeding her four - month - old son @entity299			0
ms @entity295 , who was lunching with a friend , was offered a spot by the restaurant 's toilets , which bosses at the restaurant say was more ' convenient ' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there			0
around 70 women descended on @entity310 in @entity311 in april last year to show support for 25 - year - old @entity313 , who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three - month - old son			0
she claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of ' company policy '			1
the sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to @entity323 which had a baby and mother room			0
mothers who staged a mass breastfeeding protest at a @entity321 in @entity311 in support for @entity313 , who claims she was asked to leave the premises for breastfeeding her son			1

@entity0 , 39 , hoped to avoid jury service as she was breastfeeding
claims she was told she must attend as it was no reason to skip jury duty
the official told her this was because she could ' use a bottle ' , she claims
@entity30 denies receiving an official exemption application or that an ' application has been declined on the grounds of breastfeeding '
breastfeeding campaigners have labelled the alleged comment ' appalling '
