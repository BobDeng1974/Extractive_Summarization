frustrated commuters faced fresh travel misery today thanks to a signal failure outside @entity3 and flooding in tunnels between @entity6 and @entity7			1
flooding from the burst water main has left @entity9 unable to run any trains between @entity7 and @entity6 until at least the end of today ’s service			1
@entity13 is working to stop the massive leak and @entity15 said it has pumped out more than 300,000 litres of water after the water main ruptured friday and continued to flood the tunnels over the weekend			1
a reduced service is in place on the @entity9 line , which runs 140 miles from @entity31 to @entity32			2
commuters have been forced to switch to buses or alternative train services to get to work as some trips have been delayed by up to an hour			2
@entity9 said service between @entity7 and @entity6 will not resume until the water is pumped out @entity9 has apologised to passengers for the service disruption which began last week meanwhile @entity42 were disrupted through the morning commute due to the signal failure outside @entity3 , one of the country ’s busiest railway stations			1

a signalling problem at @entity54 and a broken - down train at @entity56 also caused delays of up 30 minutes to trains between @entity3 @entity54 and @entity59 in @entity60			1
commuters suffered delays and disruption every day last week because of signalling problems and broken - down trains			2

their privatised and fragmented rail system leaves the @entity84 paying the highest fares in @entity90 to travel on clapped - out and unreliable services			0
‘ two decades of profiteering and under - investment has reduced our railways to chaos			0
’ a fault affecting live train information across the rail network compounded commuters ’ misery , leaving passengers struggling to track services amid the delays			0
