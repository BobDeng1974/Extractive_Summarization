few would describe life at @entity1 as serene			1
but , when you ’ve left behind the car crash that is @entity4 , that ’s how it feels			1
despite a run of poor results under @entity9 , as @entity10 chats at @entity1 ’s @entity12 training base , the troubles in @entity6 could n’t seem farther away			1
@entity10 is , however , intent on setting the record straight surrounding his departure from @entity4 - a switch which made him the most expensive player in @entity19 history when he moved for a jaw - dropping £ 11million			1
‘ it ’s pretty easy to respond to because it ’s just pure facts , ’ @entity10 said			1
‘ i was told by the club not to train because they were talking to @entity1			1
‘ they did n’t want me injured with the size of the fee - it was important to the club that they did n’t miss out on that			0
i did n’t train on the thursday or friday			2
we were off saturday and sunday			0
monday was the day the fee was agreed			0
@entity4 were going to @entity34 for pre-season so i was down here doing my medical			1
’ @entity26 asserts that was the day @entity10 failed to show up for training			1
‘ where that one came from , that i did n’t show up on the monday to go to training , is ludicrous			0
’ there was no resentment in @entity10 ’s voice , no disbelief			1
the tone was one of grim acceptance			0
‘ it ’s just the way that it was always going to be , ’ he added			0
‘ it was never going to be “ thanks for what you did last season , thanks for the help you ’ve given the club ”			2
it was pretty nasty in the end to be honest			0
new challenge : @entity10 has left the car crash at @entity4 but is now in a struggling @entity1 side happy : @entity10 says that his family were settled in @entity6 and he had no desire to leave the club struggles : @entity1 are languishing towards the bottom of the @entity19 under @entity9 this season setting sights low : @entity85 ( right ) has already sacked @entity4 boss @entity86 ( left ) this season revolving door : @entity26 ( right ) only parted company with former manager @entity89 ( right ) in may ‘ the conversations were that the club did n’t want me to leave - or mr @entity26 , mr president … the chairman - he did n’t want me to leave			1
he said you can leave but it ’s got to come across as you are initiating it			2
‘ so there was a transfer request put in all for the benefit of the club , where they can come across in a good light to the fans			2
‘ unfortunately at the time the fans probably took sides with the owner			2
after a few things have come to light maybe they are turning a little bit			0
‘ at the time i did n’t want to go			2
i was n’t the only player that did n’t really like what was going on			0
the only difference was that i was probably the only one who said what he felt			0
they did n’t take too kindly to that			0
’ settled : @entity10 is starting to get used to life at @entity1 and has moved close to the club 's training base price tag : @entity10 moved to @entity1 for a hefty £ 11m but insists that fee will not affect him this season so , was it the case that @entity26 smelled the cash and got shut of @entity10 ? ‘ there you go			1
he named his price and he got it			0
it ’s sad because that was somewhere i honestly thought i was going to finish my career			0
i believed it was my club			0
‘ i had a house there and was more than happy to retire there			0
my little man was settled and my missus liked it			2
’ @entity10 now lives close by to @entity1 with his girlfriend @entity134 and son @entity135 and has settled well down south			1
the focus on a different pressure - arresting @entity1 ’s recent slide - is a relief as he prepares to link up with last season ’s strike partner @entity140 , who was also shown the door at @entity4			1
the huge fee paid by @entity1 does n’t daunt him , and he delivered a fair dollop of pragmatism with his reasoning , addressing why there was only a £ 5m difference between himself and @entity150 ’s £ 16m signing @entity149			1
new partnership : @entity10 will hope to strike up a good understanding with @entity140 at @entity1 this year big money : @entity10 cost £ 5m less than @entity149 , who moved to @entity150 this summer for £ 16m ‘ what you ’ve got to remember is i had four years left on my contract at @entity4			1
@entity1 had to pay a premium to get me out of that contract , ’ he added			2
‘ it ’s hard to sit here and say i could ’ve gone to other clubs but i probably could have			0
but @entity1 were willing to give @entity4 the most money			1
@entity4 said “ you ’re either going there or you ’re not going at all ”			2
‘ if you ’re talking @entity149 , if @entity164 did n’t want to sell him then he would n’t be sold for £ 16m			1
i ’d say there ’d be an extra £ 10m on top of that because he ’s worth it			2
’ it is only four years ago that @entity4 paid @entity171 £ 300,000 for @entity10			1
‘ you ’re worth what someone is willing to pay for you , ’ he said			0
if only there was that kind of reasoning at the club the @entity173 left behind			0
this season , one @entity179 fan will win the £ 250,000 @entity181 for their club to spend on players in the january 2015 transfer window			1
