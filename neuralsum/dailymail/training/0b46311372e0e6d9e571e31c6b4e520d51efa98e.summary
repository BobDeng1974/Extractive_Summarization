@entity1 could be richer than @entity2 within 15 years if it presses ahead with economic reforms to boost growth , @entity0 said last night			1
in a bullish assessment , the chancellor said there was ' no reason why @entity1 can not be the richest major economy in the world ' , provided it continues reforms to upgrade the country 's skills base and creaking infrastructure			1
mr @entity0 also laid out plans for a new fiscal rule that would prevent future governments going on a borrowing spree – and force them to start paying down @entity1 's debts			1
he hinted at a fresh assault on the planning system , saying he wanted to go ' further ' to make it easier to build new homes and infrastructure – including a new runway at one of @entity39 's airports			1
and he said the number of youngsters going to university was still ' too low '			0
but he hit out at ' pessimists ' who claimed the government 's austerity programme would prevent a recovery			2
' the problem for the pessimists is that the evidence and experience of the last few years increasingly do n't support their claims , ' he said			1
' instead , the case for optimism is strengthening			0
if we are willing to take on the vested interests and pursue the right policies with consistency and discipline then there are no limits to what @entity1 can achieve			2
' the @entity1 economy is now above its pre-crash peak after seven quarters of growth , which mr @entity0 hopes will continue over the next decade the value of @entity1 's biggest companies tumbled by nearly £ 40billion last night as fears over the outlook for the global economy sent shockwaves around the world			1
stock markets fell on both sides of the @entity76 – with the @entity77 down 2.35 per cent or 153.74 to 6388.46 in @entity39 – after the @entity78 slashed its forecasts for global growth			0
this reduced the value of @entity1 's blue - chip companies by £ 39.1billion			2
@entity84 , chief economist at the @entity78 , said the global economy had become far too dependent on growth in the @entity2			2
he also warned that the @entity1 would be one of the countries hit the hardest by prolonged stagnation in the eurozone			2
mr @entity0 added : ' we can become the most prosperous of any major economy by the 2030s , with that prosperity widely shared – an aim i believe is firmly within our grasp			1
' treasury sources suggested the target was to make the @entity1 the wealthiest country in the @entity101 by gdp per head			1
the @entity1 is currently joint fifth , far behind the @entity2			1
in a speech to the @entity23 in @entity39 , mr @entity0 said plummeting inflation , which fell to 0.5 per cent this week , was the ' latest challenge ' for the economy			1
but he said it was driven by falling oil prices , which households should ' celebrate '			0
he added : ' we should not confuse this welcome news for @entity1 's households as a result of falling oil prices with the threat of damaging deflation that we see in the eurozone			2
' however , the @entity121 chancellor 's remarks drew a stinging response from his coalition partners			0
a @entity125 spokesman said : ' @entity0 's plans are unfair in two very important aspects			1
like us , they are planning to balance the books by 2017 - 18			0
but they will do that solely by cuts that will hit the working age poor			0
' in contrast , we will balance the books by a mixture of spending cuts and some taxes on the better off			0
once the books are balanced the @entity121 plan to run a surplus means they will embark on years of cuts to our public services			0
' that will damage public services and damage the life chances of those who depend on them			0
there should be light at the end of the tunnel once the deficit is eliminated			0
@entity0 's plans confirm the @entity121 's want to turn that light off			1
life under a @entity121 majority government will be grim indeed for all but the best off			0

@entity1 can be richer than the @entity2 within 15 years , @entity0 claims
he has laid out plans for new rule preventing future government spending
mr @entity0 hopes to make it easier to build new homes and infrastructure
a string of new reforms will be needed after the election , he said last night
