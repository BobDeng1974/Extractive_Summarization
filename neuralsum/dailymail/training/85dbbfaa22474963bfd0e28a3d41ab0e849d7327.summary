by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 19 august 2012 updated : 10:56 est , 19 august 2012 @entity1 believes her son was wrongly found guilty of murder and she has made it her quest to prove not only that he is innocent , but that one of the jurors that convicted him should never have been on the case			1
mrs @entity1 , then 46 , launched her own investigation into juror @entity11 , then 31 , donning short shorts and a recording device and spending hours recording their conversations , resulting in what she thought was explosive testimony , sure to earn @entity18 a mistrial			1
however , the @entity20 did not believe her , saying that @entity18 did in fact order 19 - year - old @entity22 to be gunned down in cold blood to raise the profile of his ' @entity26 ' gang and that all her efforts worked against her , saying every bit of evidence she uncovered was tainted and she was nothing more than a vigilante			1
@entity33 , she 's now demanding that the @entity35 governor look at her son 's case , as well as her own , and offer him a retrial			1
found wrapped in a blanket on the street , he was shot five times in the face and chest			2
police accused @entity18 of ordering mr @entity22 's death , saying that he told @entity59 to shoot him in order to get street cred for their ' @entity26 ' gang			1
in 2005 , they were convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years to life for what was called the ' grid kid ' slaying			1
but that 's when mrs @entity1 went from the weeping mother at her son 's trial to a buxom @entity74 blonde			1
changing her name from @entity1 to @entity77 , mrs @entity1 began her quest to prove that @entity11 , a @entity80 contractor , was not only a dishonest juror , but one that sought out to convict her son of the heinous crime because of a personal vendetta			1
more than just dying her hair , ' @entity77 ' rented an apartment near mr @entity11 's home , joined a gym , got a new cell phone number and assumed a new identity			1
she rode her bicycle around and around the block hoping to gain his attention - and she did			0
' every time i went to his neighborhood i would have to wear makeup , have my hair done , wear fake eyelashes , ' she told @entity101			0
' i was prepared to do anything within the law			0
' for more than a year , @entity77 plied mr @entity11 with wine and weed , discussing the trial and all the reasons , she says , he should never have been on the case			1
transformation : more than just dying her hair , mrs @entity1 , left , became ' @entity77 ' , right , renting an apartment near mr @entity11 's home , joining a gym , changing her number and assuming a new identity ' they tried to make him out to be like the @entity119 , but he was a f * * * ing clown , ' mr @entity11 said in the recordings			1
' he 's a tall , skinny @entity122 kid with glasses			0
' he later told her , ' i hate @entity122			0
' prejudice aside , the most damning evidence mrs @entity1 obtained was that mr @entity11 knew several of the witnesses - even her son - and disliked them			1
' i should n't have even been in that jury			0
' @entity11 ' technically , by law , if i knew that s * * * i should n't have even been in that jury , ' he said on the tape			1
' by law , you 're not supposed to be			0
because they ask you in the beginning when you go to jury duty if … they read you a list of all the witnesses			0
' her sting operation was not without its difficulties			0
her husband , @entity146 , would stay up until late when she returned from her sessions with mr @entity11			2
' even when i was home , i was n’t home , ' she told the @entity151			0
' husbands are always second when you have kids			0
so when you say you ’d do anything for your kid , you mean it			0
if i ’m gon na lose @entity146 over my son , so be it			2
you could always get another husband			0
' home : for more than a year , ' @entity77 ' plied mr @entity11 with wine and weed , discussing the trial and all the reasons , she says , he should never have been on the case			2
her faux apartment is pictured in 2010 , she filed an appeal with her attorney , alleging juror misconduct and demanded that her son be re-tried			1
' [ t ] he defendant ’s motion reveals extraordinary misconduct , ' the judge 's ruling read , ' not by a juror , but by the woman who generated the motion — the defendant ’s mother			2
' the judge ruled that the tapes of evidence were ' selectively recorded ' and there was no way of knowing whether they had been manipulated			2
her allegations fell on deaf ears , the judge saying that her own deceits made her an unreliable source , not to mention her obvious bias			0
mrs @entity1 still has n't given up			2
fueled by the judge 's rejection , she has now appealed to @entity35 governor @entity198 , demanding that he hold a new trial outside of @entity74 so that hopefully , justice will finally prevail .			0

in 2003 , @entity22 , 19 , was found dead after a night of *partying* with @entity202
in 2005 , @entity202 and an *accomplice* were found guilty of murder
*convinced* her son was innocent , @entity1 launched her own investigation into juror @entity11
recording their conversations , she thought she found evidence of juror misconduct
in 2010 , she demanded an appeal , but was *rebuffed*
now she wants the governor to *overturn* the guilty *verdict* and give her son another *day* in court
