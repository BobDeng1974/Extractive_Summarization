@entity1 researcher @entity0 shows the fine points of the ' fireball ' that might be expected from an asteroid exploding in @entity6 's atmosphere , as indicated in a supercomputer simulation a meteor that exploded over @entity9 was 30 times brighter than the sun , with the force of 40 @entity13 atom bombs , said scientists			1
their analysis confirmed the meteor crash was the biggest in a century			0
they also warned it was a wake - up call for humanity about the increased threat of space rocks smashing into the @entity6			1
the 62ft - wide missile exploded in a fireball above the city of @entity25 on february 15 , causing damage up to 50 miles away			2
at its fastest , it was travelling at more than 40,000mph			0
according to experts , combining the recent @entity25 crash with the 1908 tunguska explosion over @entity31 and the 1963 @entity33 blast off the coast of @entity35 , data suggests that the rate of small space rocks entering our atmosphere is actually much higher than previously thought			1
speaking at at the @entity42 's 2013 @entity44 meeting , @entity0 , a physicist at @entity1 in @entity41 , explored the implications of the @entity25 airburst event , which happened on october 7 this year			1
‘ these three data points together suggest that maybe we have underestimated the population of smaller sized objects that can create air bursts , ’ said dr @entity0			1
‘ we think the airburst hazard is greater than previously thought , ’ he added			1
the 1963 @entity33 blast was a 1.1 - megaton explosion picked up by a global network of infrasound sensors , but not apparently seen by any observers			0
it was the largest object to hit the @entity6 since the tunguska event of 1908 , when an exploding comet or asteroid destroyed 2,000 square kilometres of @entity31 forest the explosion of a previously undetected asteroid about 25 miles from the @entity9 city of @entity25 , led to widespread blast damage , @entity70 reported			1
according to the @entity76 , the space rock blew apart 18.5 miles above the city , briefly outshining the sun and inflicting severe burns on a number of observers below			2
but it has also spurred a wealth of data helping scientists to gauge the object 's size , angle of entry and other specifics , dr @entity0 said			1
he estimates the explosive yield of the most recent space rock was at 400 to 500 kilotonnes , making it the most powerful event since @entity93			2
the impact site of the main mass of the @entity25 meteorite in the ice of @entity98 2000 @entity100 's flyby is almost exactly a year after a meteor unexpectedly exploded above @entity25 , @entity9 , causing damage and injuring more than 1,000 people with falling glass a naturally - occurring air burst arises from the explosion of incoming meteors , which explode in the air and not on the ground			1
examples include the tunguska event , the @entity113 event and the @entity25 meteor event			0
the term also refers to the detonation of an explosive device such as a nuclear weapon in the air			2
the principal military advantage of an air burst over a ground burst is that the energy from the explosion is distributed more evenly over a wider area			2
the @entity25 meteor , which measured around 20 metres in diameter with a mass of 12,000 tonnes , exploded just 30km above the ground			0
fortunately , the meteor came in at an angle to spread its energy sideways , creating less damage on the ground			0
@entity134 , a physics professor at the @entity135 in @entity136 , has collected over 500 videos of the event which injured around 1,500 people as glass windows shattered in the post-explosion shockwave			0
dr @entity0 believes taking cover on the ground and staying away from windows is the best course of action in the event of another similar occurrence			2
writing in journal @entity149 , he predicts the next destructive @entity152 ( @entity152 ) event will be an airburst and has suggested an outburst warning system should be used to deal with the threat			0
three data points suggest that scientists have underestimated the population of smaller sized objects ( such as meteors ) that can create air bursts			1
an illustration of an asteroid headed towards @entity6 is illustrated @entity165 government sensors also documented the @entity25 event and released the data captured to the scientific community			1
commenting on another expert 's concerns that an air burst could he misinterpreted as a preemptive attack from another country , dr @entity0 said he thought the worries were exaggerated before he watched a number of @entity25 event videos			1
' say that this had happened on an overcast day , where nobody actually saw the streak across the sky			0
then you see smoke , hear a large explosion and a lot of things that sound like artillery fire			0
' then imagine it 's over a place that 's already politically unstable			0
one of the biggest threats could be that this might lead to a counterattack of somebody because something was misconstrued , ' he said .			0

@entity165 physicist @entity0 said collisions from outer space could cause more damage than nuclear explosions
the scientist , at @entity1 in @entity41 , believes experts underestimate the population of objects that can make air bursts
the rate of small space rocks entering the @entity6 's atmosphere is much higher than previously thought , he warns
