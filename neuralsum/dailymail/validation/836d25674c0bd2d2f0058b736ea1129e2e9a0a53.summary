@entity0 on the @entity2 board may be worth only £ 400 , but with soaring house prices the reality today is eye - wateringly different			1
a four - storey townhouse in the exclusive @entity8 area now sells for £ 40million , while even a flat in the cheapest @entity2 area of @entity10 has gone for nearly £ 5million			1
in light of such ludicrous prices , one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game – set in desirable @entity16 market towns			1

@entity66 , of @entity39 , said : ‘ we looked for towns with the highest average value across different regions of the @entity71			2
