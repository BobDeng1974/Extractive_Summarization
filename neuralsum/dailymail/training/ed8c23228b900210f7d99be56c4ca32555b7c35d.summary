by @entity1 reporter published : 13:05 est , 20 june 2012 updated : 08:49 est , 21 june 2012 accusations : @entity3 faced a backlash today over allegations he invested in a scheme allegedly designed to avoid paying tax @entity3 faced a backlash last night after it emerged he and two @entity10 bandmates invested £ 26million in a scheme allegedly designed to avoid paying tax			1
@entity3 , @entity13 , @entity14 and their manager , @entity15 , face suggestions they avoided paying their fair share of income tax			1
they are among 1,000 people who contributed £ 480million to 62 partnerships in music industry investment schemes that act as tax shelters for super-rich individuals			1
the revelations have prompted mps to question the decision to honour @entity3 with an obe this month			1
revenue officials will attempt to shut down the partnerships , run by a company called @entity34 , at a tribunal in november			1
a spokesman for @entity37 said : ' we do not accept that the @entity34 tax schemes have the tax effects their promoters claim			1
' he said one @entity34 scheme had already been successfully challenged			1
@entity45 mp @entity44 criticised @entity3 yesterday , saying : ' it 's less @entity10 and more like @entity47			1
@entity3 needs to do his patriotic duty and show he is not a part - time patriot off - shoring his wealth through this shelter while keeping his obe on - shore			1
' @entity52 , the @entity53 deputy leader , said he was ' on the warpath ' over people who did not pay full tax			1
he said : ' honours are meant to be for people who serve @entity59 and are good citizens in doing so			2
if you do n't pay your taxes you 're not a fully decent citizen			2
' in the future , the honours committee – because these things are all scrutinised – should make sure that people are clean as far as their tax affairs are concerned as well as having done good public service for @entity59 and its exports			2
' mr @entity52 added : ' i think we 'll hear a lot more of this in the weeks ahead			2
i 'm certainly one of those on the warpath and i 'm not going to be diverted			2
' we 've had billions of pounds unpaid every year by people like the comedians and the singers we 're talking about – that 's got to end			1
' ' seeking haven ' : fellow @entity10 stars @entity14 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) are also said to have invested in the scheme , which @entity37 is attempting to shut down lawyers representing @entity3 , @entity13 , @entity14 and mr @entity15 confirmed their clients were investors in two @entity34 partnerships , but believed they were legitimate enterprises			1
@entity89 denies that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax			2
there is no suggestion that the scheme is illegal			2
@entity53 mp @entity96 , a member of the @entity97 , said : ‘ it is wrong for those held up as models of service and duty to be given or indeed to accept honours despite having deliberately avoided the payment of tax			2
@entity106 has broken his silence over claims that he dodged tax , insisting : ' i pay what i have to and not a penny more ' ' those who are happy to be honoured by their country should also be happy to pay taxes to their country			2
not doing so is not acceptable and unpatriotic			0
’ he added that those honoured by the nation ‘ should be happy to make their contribution to national life in every sense ’			0
’ @entity125 , the @entity53 ’ co-chair of their @entity127 policy committee , added : ‘ i do n’t think our system should honour individuals who do n’t pay their way			0
’ a typical @entity34 partnership collects around £ 10million from about a dozen investors and uses the funds to buy music rights in upcoming and established artists			0
investors get tax relief on any money they invest in the scheme			0
however , they are able to wipe out more tax than they actually pay because any investment they make out of their own cash can be bumped up by taking a loan arranged by @entity89 from an offshore bank and also investing this in the scheme			0
for example , someone who makes a minimum investment of £ 40,000 of their own money into an @entity89 partnership , could boost the amount they put in by taking an offshore loan for £ 160,000			0
they would get tax relief on the full amount they paid in - wiping £ 77,250 off their bill			1
a person who invests £ 200,000 in cash can earn £ 1million tax free			0
if the tax relief they get is greater than their annual income then it can be used by a wealthy investor against other income they have paid tax on during the previous three years			0
@entity89 denied that its partnerships were designed to avoid tax			0
it said they were intended to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘ creative and artistic material and [ creating ] taxable profits ’ @entity188 records show that the three @entity10 members and their manager joined two icebreaker partnerships in march 2010 and september 2011			1
in the first , they put in £ 5.2million of their own cash and borrowed another £ 20.8million			0
the partnership registered a loss in the year to april 2010 of £ 25.2million , which accounts show as ‘ available for discretionary division among members ’			0
lawyers representing @entity3 , @entity13 , @entity14 and mr @entity15 said the men had paid significant amounts of tax			1
they confirmed that their clients were investors in the two partnerships , but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax - avoidance schemes			1
there is no suggestion that other members of @entity10 were investors - and it is not known whether those that did were aware of the tax benefits when they invested in the partnerships			1
there is no suggestion that the scheme is illegal			0
a typical @entity34 partnership collects around £ 10million from about a dozen investors and uses the funds to buy music rights in upcoming and established artists			0
@entity89 can help investors to save more in tax than they put into the scheme with losses being offset by a wealthy investor against other income earned during the previous three years			0
investors can bump up this tax relief by taking out offshore loans arranged by @entity89			0
for a minimum investment of £ 40,000 into an @entity89 partnership , boosted by an offshore loan of £ 160,000 , a member can generate £ 77,520 of tax relief			0
a person who invests £ 200,000 in cash can earn £ 1million tax free .			0

faces allegations together with band - mates @entity13 and @entity14 and their manager @entity15
could face paying back millions of pounds if @entity37 officials are successful
