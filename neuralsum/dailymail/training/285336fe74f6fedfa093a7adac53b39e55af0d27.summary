the elephants of my childhood , @entity0 and @entity1 , have probably been killed by now			1
i was very lucky that i ever got to see them with my own eyes , but such are the perks for a little boy whose grandfather was the @entity10 ’s top biologist			2
they were fictitious in the beginning , invented by my grandfather @entity13 , as he tucked me in to bed at night			2
i would hear how @entity0 and @entity1 would get stuck in mud holes and roam the @entity17 forests getting into adventures , and how @entity0 would save little @entity1 from the clutches of lions and leopards			1
in the flickering electricity of the lamps in our @entity10 flat , it was my first introduction to the wonder of wildlife			1
i stared at the joy of it : the plodding feet , the curling trunks moving across the wide escarpment , the young ones nuzzling at the grown - ups ’ tree - trunk legs			0
almost all the adults were female , my grandfather explained , except for two young males , old enough now to soon start out of their own , their life ’s adventures unfolding in front of them like the @entity17 savannah			1
the larger one , he nicknamed @entity0 ; the smaller one , @entity1			0
it was an image of calm perfection — a scene which , even to my then 14 - year - old self , was clearly how nature at its purest should be			1
@entity0 and @entity1 were young enough , then , to still be alive now , and they may well be , but the numbers suggest otherwise			0
they may still be trumpeting around the @entity17 bush			1
but it ’s more likely that what remains of them is an ivory dragon somewhere on a @entity74 mantelpiece			1
when i saw that herd there were around 1.2 million elephants on the continent			1
three - quarters of those , including most likely many of the elephants i saw that day , have since been hunted for their tusks — and the numbers being lost are growing			2
the reality is that there is a war going on in @entity89 and it is war between wildlife rangers and poachers to ensure the survival of some of the world ’s most iconic species			1
it is also a war that the conservationists are losing			0
elephants have been poached in such numbers that unless urgent action is taken the reality we face is that they risk extinction in the wild within the next decade			1
this is not only the case in @entity34 but across @entity89			0
this year alone some 36,000 elephants will be killed across the continent — an average of one every 20 minutes			1
an @entity17 elephant pictured as it charges towards the photographer			1
this year alone some 36,000 elephants will be killed across the @entity17 continent - an average of one every 20 minutes in @entity116 , which once had 15,000 elephants , there are now just 400			1
in @entity119 , the last elephant disappeared three years ago			0
the reason is greed — and specifically the vast profits that can be made from ivory due to the seemingly insatiable demand of @entity126 ’s rapidly growing middle - classes			1
many there still see ivory as an aspirational product and , as people ’s bank balances swell , the law of supply and demand has resulted in prices rocketing			1
a kilogram of ivory is now worth £ 1,225 on the black market , three times what it was four years ago			2
the tragedy is that many do not appreciate the consequence of their purchase as , incredibly , it is not universally known in @entity126 that elephants are killed to extract their ivory			1
in @entity74 , some 70 per cent of people were found in a survey to believe tusks grew back like fingernails			0
that ignorance is resulting in bloodied carcasses across the savannahs			0
i recently returned from @entity89 , where i have been working closely with the @entity34 - based elephant protection charity space for @entity159 to do what we can to help save those elephants that remain			1
together we have helped finance anti-poaching patrols in @entity164 , one of the last great enclaves for elephants in @entity89 , and helped facilitate the purchase of a new conservancy , @entity170 , to act as a vast — and heavily protected — sanctuary			2
rangers look over the carcass of an elephant found shot dead by poachers in @entity176 training programmes have been introduced for local wildlife rangers and the judiciary , and plans are in place to extend our work into @entity183 and @entity184			1
the trip rammed home the scale of the threat — and the urgency of the action required to combat it			0
those seeking to kill elephants are no longer local farmers armed with a bow and arrow or an old rifle , seeking some extra bucks			1
increasingly , it is heavily armed professional gangs financed by the same money - men who make their wealth from the smuggling of drugs and people being sold into prostitution			2
organisations that rank among the most loathsome in the world are culpable			0
@entity208 , the @entity210 extremists who carried out the slaughter in @entity42 ’s @entity212 ; @entity214 ’s @entity213 , which routinely kidnaps and drugs children to turn them into child soldiers ; and @entity217 , the roving gunmen who carried out the genocide in @entity220 , all resort to ivory poaching to finance their nefarious activities			1
against them is a thin green line of wildlife rangers			1
in the face of such a sustained onslaught , they have had to militarise or risk being overrun			0
pictured is the decomposed carcasses of two elephants found in @entity233 , @entity176 in @entity164 , i have been on night patrols with units of these brave men			2
and be in no doubt that the dangers they face are no less than those confronting combatants in a real war			0
space for @entity159 ’ rangers are dressed in combat fatigues			1
their weapons are @entity249 , the @entity251 - made automatic rifle that is one of the most efficient and modern in the world			0
their webbing is filled with military supplies , including night - vision goggles and closed - frequency radios			0
the medic , taking up the rear , normally has the latest combat kit , including bandages dripped in quick - clot — only just developed by @entity265 forces — to stop the bleeding from a gunshot wound			0
before we set out one evening , the unit ’s commander , @entity268 , left me in no doubt as to why such equipment is needed			0
‘ a report came in on the radio that the poachers were active and we mobilised the helicopter to get to them before they could reach the animals , ’ he said of a recent patrol			1
‘ it meant we got there ahead of them so we could set our ambush			0
we could see them , all armed with @entity286			2
’ dozens of elephant tusks are laid out on display in a sombre reminder of the illegal ivory trade twelve people have been killed in the poaching war being waged in just a small area of @entity34			1
to the north , in @entity297 , five poachers were shot dead and two rangers wounded in a further fire - fight			1
the same story is being repeated across the continent			2
@entity304 ’s @entity303 saw a police constable and a ranger killed as they tried to track poachers seeking rhino horn			1
in @entity311 , there have been reports of poachers using attack helicopters to mow down elephants			1
some 1,000 wildlife rangers — a third more than the entire losses of the @entity318 military in @entity319 and @entity320 — have been killed in the past decade			1
space for @entity159 ’ founder , dr @entity322 , is certain that only ‘ boots on the ground ’ , like those i patrolled with , can blunt the poaching threat until demand in @entity126 is eased through education programmes			1
changing such beliefs , however , is a process that will likely take decades			0
‘ the illegal trade has already effectively wiped out rhinos from the wild , forcing them to become a highly managed population in a small number of sanctuaries , ’ he explained			0
‘ that ’s what will happen to elephants if the present rate of slaughter continues			2
that is the reality of the situation			0
it ’s a war , a war for wildlife , being waged right here , right now			2
” my grandfather is no longer with us , although his work is still studied in universities across the @entity352			0
he died in 1998 of a rare form of bone cancer , most likely caused as a result of the work he was required to conduct in @entity358 in the immediate aftermath of the reactor meltdown			0
the demand for ivory has increased in recent years and is largely fuelled by @entity126 's burgeoning middle classes he always wanted me to be a zoologist			1
i let him down in not achieving that but i still gained from him a love of nature and a life - long commitment to conversation and wildlife protection			2
it is what makes what is now unfolding to the animals he first introduced me to in those make - believe stories so unbearable to watch			2
i know he would be proud of what — with @entity321 for @entity159 and all the @entity380 and @entity381 readers who have supported this cause — we have achieved so far			1
in the area of @entity164 that is implementing our programmes , poaching rates are already down 60 per cent			0
and the area we protect will spread			0
i am committed to that			0
part of our work involves tracking elephants ’ migratory patterns so the alert can be raised if one approaches known poaching hot spots			2
to do this the animals are darted and a @entity398 collar is fitted			2
each is then given a name so it can be identified as its progress is charted			0
late last year we darted a young male , which we nicknamed @entity1			2
recently , i fitted another collar , this time to a fully - grown bull elephant			0
it means i can now track them both through the elephant - monitoring system fitted to @entity321 for @entity159 computers , and watch this new @entity0 and @entity1 as they really do roam the plains of @entity89 as elephants have since before the dawn of man			1
long may they do so			0
and long may all their kind continue to do so , despite the war waged against them so that their tusks can be turned into trinkets			0
this is a fight for their survival that can not be lost			0
my grandfather would have told me that			0
it is what he taught me all those years ago at my bedside .			0
