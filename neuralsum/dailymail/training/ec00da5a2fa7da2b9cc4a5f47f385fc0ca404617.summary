by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 18:52 est , 19 april 2013 arrests : a man and a woman have been held after @entity6 's crime commissioner @entity5 ' expenses claims , which included limo journeys , were allegedly leaked the police and crime commissioner who reported his staff for exposing his expenses claim for a chauffeur - driven @entity12 apologised yesterday – but says he has no regrets about calling in the police			1
@entity16 @entity5 reported the whistleblowers for telling a newspaper he had charged the taxpayer £ 700 for two chauffeur - driven trips			1
he admitted yesterday he should have checked the cost of the trips before charging them to the taxpayer , but refused to apologise to the three people who face possible prison sentences if they are convicted of leaking details of his expenses claim			1
he went on to say that he would use his new £ 23,000 @entity31 crossover – another taxpayer - funded perk – in the future			2
@entity6 police chief @entity34 said his officers will send a file to the @entity37 so it can consider charges against the staff members who blew the whistle			1
two people have been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and another on suspicion of perverting the course of justice			2
those found guilty of these offences commonly draw prison sentences of a year or more			1
mps from all parties have condemned the police investigation that followed after the local newspaper that received the leak , the @entity52 , called mr @entity5 ’ office to check the details of his expenses			1
@entity59 mp for @entity60 and @entity62 @entity61 said the affair was ‘ alarming ’ and called for new laws to protect whistleblowers			1
defence : @entity67 say that the commissioner is driven for his safety and the trips were stopped once he saw the cost @entity72 last night urged caution over plans for secret arrests			1
the home secretary said the @entity77 should be ‘ very careful ’ about removing the right for people to know who they detain			1
under guidance being drawn up by @entity77 on behalf of the judiciary , forces would be banned from revealing the names of those held on suspicion of crimes , to protect their reputation			1
even families and friends would be kept in ignorance and unable to help			2
mrs may told @entity49 : ‘ these are not just black and white arguments			0
‘ you have to look at them very carefully in terms of the impact that they have			0
’ critics say it is an assault on open justice and threatens to turn @entity102 into a ‘ banana republic ’			1
‘ it is time to change the law to give explicit protection to people who shine a spotlight on the inappropriate use of public money , ’ he said			1
‘ employees in wasteful organisations should be applauded , not punished , for taking a stand			0
’ the scandal broke after mr @entity5 spent £ 700 going to two dinners in a hired @entity12 with a driver			1
the trips were from his home in the south of the @entity121 rather than from his office in @entity123 , and cost the taxpayer £ 385 and £ 313			2
mr @entity5 made a partial apology at a press conference yesterday			1
he said : ‘ i have made two mistakes			0
firstly , not checking the cost of the car			0
others had made the arrangements			0
once i knew the costs , i immediately asked the office to stop the arrangements			0
‘ secondly , i apologise that my expenses were not published earlier			2
the short period of time since november has been a very busy period for the office			0
i apologise unreservedly to the people of @entity6 , regarding my expenses			1
’ mr @entity5 , a former headmaster , said that when he started his job , he declined a car and driver			1
but the 71 - year - old has since been supplied with a @entity145 , costing £ 23,000 , after deciding he needs it for his work			0
‘ @entity6 is an extremely large county , ’ he said			1
‘ i have driven over 4,500 miles since mid-january			0
’ mr @entity5 added : ‘ @entity67 has a whistleblowing policy , which everyone has access to and has read			1
‘ on thursday , april 4 , i had a call from the office to say that the local press had been on to them with the news about the story they were going to run about my expenses , and during that conversation we were told that photocopies of the invoices had been sent to the reporter through the mail			2
‘ this does not constitute any part of the @entity67 ’s whistleblowing policy			0
’ @entity169 mp @entity168 said the scandal was the inevitable outcome of the @entity172 on the culture , ethics and practices of the @entity176			2
miss @entity168 said : ‘ this is the sort of heavy - handed response which is a threat to those who act in the public interest by giving stories to the papers			0
’ the arrest of whistleblowers in @entity6 is just the latest embarassment to the newly created role of police and crime commissioners			1
@entity191 pcc @entity189 faced public ridicule this month after she appointed a 17 - year - old as a £ 15,000 - a - year youth crime tsar – only for the teenager to resign tearfully within a fortnight of her appointment			2
the teenager , @entity198 , stepped down after she was found to have posted a string of racist and obscene rants on @entity201 which ended up being investigated by her own force			0
resigned : teenager @entity198 mrs @entity189 has also been criticized for spending large sums on staff and equipment , including £ 15,000 on a battle bus she has called @entity208			0
other @entity209 who have faced controversy include former @entity59 minister @entity211 , who is in charge of @entity214 police			0
she was criticised after saying she would not prioritise tackling low - level drug use because it would take up too much of her officers ’ time			2
in her new policing plan she has completely ignored drug use			0
elected @entity209 were brought in by the @entity220 to introduce democracy to policing			0
but the campaigns to choose the first of the new commissioners failed to generate interest among members of the public , and turnouts for elections last november were as low as 10 per cent in some areas			0
critics say the system has introduced an expensive and pointless layer of bureaucracy to policing			0
pccs , who earn £ 65,000 to £ 100,000 depending on the size of their force , must disclose their expenses every three months , but more than half the 45 in @entity241 and @entity242 have failed to			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

they could face prison sentences if convicted
