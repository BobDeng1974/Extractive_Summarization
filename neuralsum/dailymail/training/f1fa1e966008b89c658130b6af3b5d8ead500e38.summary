the migration of early humans out of @entity2 went further and higher than previously thought			0
the new theory is based on discoveries suggesting that the inhabitants of @entity6 had contact with people in @entity8 , who built the highest @entity11 village in the world			0
the camp in the southern @entity14 was built at 4,500 metres above sea level ( masl ) and experts say the site dates high - altitude human habitation nearly a millennium earlier than previously documented			1
a rock shelter in the southern @entity14 was built at 4,500 metres above sea level and experts say the site dates high - altitude human habitation nearly a millennium earlier than previously documented			1
cunchaicha rock shelter is pictured in the face of cold temperatures , high solar radiation and low oxygen conditions , hunter - gatherers managed to colonise the remote , treeless landscapes about 12,000 years ago - within 2,000 years of humans arriving in @entity8			1
the @entity34 archaeological site revealed 260 formal tools , such as projectile points and unifacial scrapers up to 12,800 years old			1
archaeologists from the @entity39 said that @entity40 , which includes two alcoves at 4,480masl , contains contains a ‘ robust , well - preserved and well - dated occupation sequence ’ up to 12,400 years old			2
in the face of cold temperatures , high solar radiation and low oxygen conditions , hunter - gatherers managed to colonise the remote , treeless landscapes about 12,000 years ago - within 2,000 years after humans arrived in @entity8			1
an image if the inhospitable @entity46 is pictured the @entity34 archaeological site revealed 260 formal tools , such as projectile points , nondiagnostic bifaces and unifacial scrapers up to 12,800 years old			1
here , archaeologists excavate the @entity51 rock shelter a new genetics study of indigenous @entity6 islanders suggests that early @entity54 did manage to cross the @entity55 completely			0
it found that they share dna sequences with @entity59 , hinting that the two groups had been in close contact and interbred , before the arrival of the first @entity63			0
experts from the @entity65 of @entity66 , analysed the dna of 27 native @entity69 people and found that their genomes on average were 76 per cent @entity72 , eight per cent @entity73 and 16 per cent @entity63			0
it 's accepted that the @entity75 were first colonised by people crossing from @entity77 via the @entity78 - a land bridge to @entity80			2
some scientists had suggested a second colonisation from the east and this study supports this theory			0
they believe that it was probably used as a base camp , because the rock shelter has good views of wetlands and grasslands , rock art and sooted ceilings , suggesting fires were once lit there			0
most of the tools recovered at @entity98 were made locally from rocks such as obsidian , andesite and jasper and hint at the type of hunting and butchering that would have taken place on the plateau			2
bones at the site indicate that the @entity11 hunters ate vicuña and guanaco camelids - who belong to the llama family - as well as taruca deer , according to the study , published in the journal @entity119			1
the archaeologists believe that @entity46 was a high - altitude oasis for hunting as it was filled with herds of vicuña and later , alpacas and llamas			1
evidence suggests the site was occupied for a long time			2
@entity127 , of the @entity128 , @entity129 , told @entity130 : ' we do n't know if people were living there year round , but we strongly suspect they were not just going there to hunt for a few days			0
' ' there were possibly even families living at these sites , because we 've found evidence of a range of activities			0
' while the basin could have been called home for the entire year , experts think that wet - season storms , the dangers of hypothermia and the need to collect plants and meet other people , may have encouraged ancient settlers to make regular journeys to lower ground			0
experts believe that high altitude rock shelter was probably used as a base camp , because the it has good views of wetlands and grasslands , rock art and sooted ceilings , suggesting fires were once lit there			2
here , archaeologists search for stone tools at the @entity98 rock shelter the discovery of some tools support this theory because some seem to be polished by streams , which means that the hunters must have visited high - energy rivers at lower elevations			1
it is unclear whether the high - altitude human settlement required genetic or environmental adaptations			1
but with evidence of high - altitude human habitation almost 900 years earlier than previously documented , the implication is that @entity181 humans may have evolved greater physiological capabilities			1
‘ the @entity46 sites suggest that @entity181 humans lived successfully at extreme high altitude , initiating organismal selection , developmental functional adaptations and lasting biogeographic expansion in the @entity189 , ’ the researchers wrote			0
‘ as new studies identify potential genetic signatures of high - altitude adaptation in modern @entity189 populations , comparative genomic , physiologic and archaeological research will be needed to understand when and how these adaptations evolved			1
@entity198 , visiting assistant professor at the university , said : ‘ the study of human adaptation to extreme environments is important in understanding our cultural and genetic capacity for survival			0
’ the discovery of some tools found near the ancient shelter sugests that materials were colected from lower altitudes , because some seem to be polished by streams , which means that the hunters must have visited high - energy rivers at lower elevations			2

@entity218 in the @entity14 was built at 4,500 metres above sea level
tools *provide* evidence that high - altitude human habitation occured 12,000 years ago - nearly a millennium earlier than previously documented
hunter - gatherers colonised the remote region despite cold temperatures , high solar radiation and low oxygen conditions
@entity233 archaeological site revealed 260 formal tools including scrapers
*remains* hint hunters dined on camelids and taruca deer
