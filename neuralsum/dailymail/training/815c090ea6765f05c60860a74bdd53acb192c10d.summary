after it was cleaned up - causing the staff to run out of toilet paper - the dog went again , passengers said
the plane was forced to land in @entity85 , @entity86 so crews could clean up before the plane took off again and *completed* the journey
owner was *apologetic* and told everyone she wanted to give them gifts
