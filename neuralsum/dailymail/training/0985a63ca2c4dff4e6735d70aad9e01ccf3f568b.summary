by @entity0 published : 07:30 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 12:44 est , 18 february 2013 a wildlife photographer hoping to capture images of the elusive bobcat was horrified when she eventually found one - in the jaws of an alligator			1
despite her shock , professional photographer @entity6 managed to capture the moment in a nature centre in @entity10 on her camera			1
the brutal collection of images show the alligator in its most lethal state as it rips apart the bobcat - normally around twice the size of a domestic cat			1
ms @entity6 had spent several months visiting the nature centre to photograph the bobcats and was heartbroken to see one of them being killed by an alligator			1
ms @entity6 , 53 , said : ' as i walked on the boardwalk , someone told me a alligator had caught an otter			1
' i 've gotten used to alligators eating turtles and birds but was surprised to hear it had caught an otter			0
' as i rounded the corner the alligator jumped out of the water with an entire bobcat in his jaws			0
' i wanted to cry , i may have shed a tear or two , but i took the pictures anyway			0
' that 's what happens when your a nature photographer , you take the pictures no matter what			1
' oblivious : a bobcat leans down for a drink of water at a lake in a @entity10 nature reserve action : an alligator bursts up out of the water and pulls the bobcat underneath with its jaws ms @entity6 usually photographs birds but also has developed a passion for capturing images of bobcats			1
she said : ' i take a lot of bird photos but i am also always eager to take any animal photos especially bobcats , when i can find them			2
' ms @entity6 managed to spend much of last year following a particular family of bobcats at the @entity10 nature reserve			1
she continued : ' bobcats are usually quite elusive but i 've been lucky and have been able to watch a family of bobcats quite often throughout 2012			2
' i watched the young ones grow from blue eyed kittens into almost adults and fell in love with them			0
' trapped : the bobcat - which is normally around twice the size of a domestic cat - is wedge between the jaws of the alligator ms @entity6 spends time trying to protect the bobcats by not revealing their location for poachers to see and encouraging others to do the same			1
she said : ' i 've become very attached to this family of bobcats and have even written a children 's book about them which i am in the process of illustrating with my photography			2
' it took me weeks to recover and come to terms with what i had seen , but that 's nature and how it works			2
' since then i have spotted most members of the bobcat family - i can tell them apart by their facial markings			0
' and ms @entity6 believes it may be the father of the family who was caught by the alligator			2
rare pictures : wildlife photographer @entity6 captured these images while visiting the nature reserve to photograph a family of bobcats she added : ' i have a feeling it was the father cat			1
he is one of the two i have not seen			0
' he may have been wounded by a new male in an attempt to take his territory and breed with the female			0
' that would have made him an easy target			0
' i 've also seen the bobcats go to the waters edge for a drink or to chase a duck			0
' since alligators can stay submerged under water for up to two hours , it 's not hard to imagine how they might surprise a bobcat that way			0
' nobody saw it happen so we can only make an educated guess as to how an alligator could possibly catch a bobcat , but now we know one thing for sure , it definitely can be done			0
' up close : ms @entity6 has spent several months following the bobcat family and believes the alligator killed the father of the pack			2
