by @entity0 @entity2 ancestors , embassies for extraterrestrials and advanced supercomputers recording all human memory and dna : welcome to the often strange world of the @entity9			1
now the sect , which was founded in 1974 by @entity12 , a @entity13 retired racing journalist , has thrown open its doors to the cameras for the first time , after presenter @entity18 travelled to @entity19 to meet the @entity9 living there			1
but , as @entity21 , the man responsible for the @entity24 's @entity23 population reveals , there 's more to @entity23 life than alien ancestors			2
man in charge : @entity12 , @entity29 , is the @entity13 former journalist who created the religion ' @entity31 means that i believe in the fact that all life on earth was created by the @entity36 ; a society who came to earth 25,000 years ago specifically to create life , ' explains mr @entity21 of his beliefs			1
' we also believe that @entity12 [ @entity12 's @entity23 name ] is their messenger , here to tell the world of these facts and to open the people of the world ’s minds to the idea that we are in fact an intentional scientific creation			2
' the main goal of @entity9 at this stage is to create an embassy in order to facilitate and welcome the return of the @entity36 to @entity58			1
' like @entity59 , @entity9 is considered a ' ufo religion ' with similar theories on intelligent design and extraterrestrial life as the @entity65 sect			1
fascinated : presenter @entity66 joins @entity9 at a conference in @entity19 in @entity19 sermon : @entity31 ' bishop ' @entity69 is the president of @entity70 , which promotes human cloning unlike the @entity72 , however , @entity9 are famous for espousing sexual freedom and scientific development , and even claimed to have produced the world 's first cloned human baby in 2002			1
the cult hit the news again in 2012 , when they staged a ' @entity80 ' protest in @entity81 in a bid to persuade city authorities to allow women to go braless in public			0
other controversies have included their use of the swastika as a symbol of peace which , until 1991 when it was replaced by another motif , meant that the @entity9 found themselves banned from opening ' extraterrestrial embassies ' in @entity94 and @entity95			1
yet despite their frequently bizarre behaviour , @entity21 , who discovered the religion while browsing through some of its publications in a @entity101 bookshop , is at pains to point out that @entity9 is a real religion - and one that deserves to be taken seriously			2
' even in our most controversial moments , the @entity23 movement is attempting to help people and society at large , whether they believe in the @entity36 or agree with us or not , ' explains @entity21			1
protest : raëlians have staged protests in favour of cloning and free love all over the world , including @entity116 ' our cloning campaign pushed legislators in the @entity24 to legalise and licence stem cell therapies three to five years earlier than they were planning to do so			2
' we in the @entity24 are now a leading light in the world in this amazing medical technology			0
yet we the movement and me personally took lots of negative criticism for this			0
' he 's also got strong words for those who write off @entity9 as just another cult			0
' i personally feel that the use of terminology like " cult " in the wrong context makes the user be seen clearly as either unaware of the bigotry they echo or the bigot and a fool they are , ' he insists			0
' both speaks volumes of them and yet says nothing of the movement or myself			0
' on a day - to - day basis , @entity21 says his world is one that would be recognisable to most of us , with the main rite , baptism , only allowed on the four @entity23 anniversaries			0
one comes on the 6th august and commemorates the @entity154 bomb , while the others include the 13th december , the day on which @entity12 had his first alien encounter , and the first sunday in april , which , say the @entity9 , was the day @entity158 were created by extraterrestrials			1
alien encounter : @entity12 , pictured with a mock spaceship , says his first meeting with aliens took place in 1973 explanation : @entity19 @entity166 and princess @entity167 explain their beliefs to @entity18 during supper the final date is the 7th of october , the date on which , in 1975 , @entity12 claims he was taken for a ride in a spacecraft by the @entity36			1
other key beliefs include world peace and a coming judgement day when the @entity36 , who record every human memory and dna on an advanced supercomputer , will return to @entity58 and resurrect those who have already died using cloning			0
in preparation for that day , the @entity9 are in the process of creating an extraterrestrial embassy , which they hope to build in @entity188 , to welcome the @entity36 back to @entity58			1
among those looking forward to the big day is @entity21			0
' i will welcome @entity36 with respect , just as one would welcome your long - departed parents back home , ' he enthuses			0
' why would i do this ? , ' he adds			0
' because they created a wonderful place for me to inhabit and are the reason i and all of us exist			0
' the @entity9 appear on outsiders with @entity18 , tonight at 10pm on @entity202			2
