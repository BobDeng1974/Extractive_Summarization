by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 21:59 est , 24 october 2013 one in four @entity3 hospital trusts is failing to offer safe , good - quality care to all its patients , a damning report has shown			1
out of 161 trusts in @entity7 , 44 have now been labelled as ‘ high risk ’ , with serious concerns raised about their performance			1
shockingly , a number of the hospitals now marked out as risky were classified ‘ safe ’ as recently as earlier this year			0
care : @entity13 said @entity14 should be ' ashamed ' that ' after three and a half years of the coalition one in four hospitals are at risk of poor performance			1
the prime minister is pictured visiting @entity20 , which is in the second highest band some of the hospitals have been flagged up because of high death rates while others have been identified because of frequent ‘ never events ’ – serious incidents that should never occur in hospitals , such as amputating the wrong limb			0
risk factors that have also been taken into consideration include poor safety measures , low staffing levels , lengthy waiting times , high levels of superbugs or very low levels of patient satisfaction			2
let down : schoolgirl @entity38 yesterday ’s report came after health watchdog the @entity40 examined 161 acute trusts across @entity7 against more than 150 indicators , giving each one a risk score			1
the analysis will act as a screening tool to identify which trusts need the most rapid inspections			2
this new approach has shown that three times as many hospitals as previously thought are actually failing , with 24 in the highest possible band of risk and 44 trusts in the top two bands			1
one of the failing hospitals was criticised earlier this year for not carrying out simple tests on a schoolgirl who later died from a brain condition			0
@entity38 , 15 , was taken to @entity60 in november 2008 complaining of a headache			0
she died three days later after a catalogue of errors at the risky hospital			0
an inquest heard there were several missed opportunities to save her life			0
yesterday health secretary @entity69 welcomed the @entity40 ’s tougher stance , but insisted that the failings exposed by the review were the result of ‘ problems stretching back many years ’			1
he said : ‘ sadly , under the last government , a lack of transparency about poor care meant problems went unchecked for too long , sometimes with tragic consequences for patients			1
‘ the @entity40 ’s new tough and transparent approach to hospital standards is exactly what our @entity3 needs			2
the information released today is not new in many cases , several of these hospitals have had serious problems stretching back for many years			0
alert : @entity91 , @entity92 in @entity93 is placed in @entity94 , at high risk on whistleblowing alerts and mortality rates mothers : @entity99 , placed in @entity94 , is at high risk on c - sections in maternity care , mortality data and whistleblowers inspector : professor @entity106 said the new bands would highlight where there is a risk that people might not be receiving ' safe , effective , high quality care ' ‘ the difference now is that this government is being transparent with this information and honest with the public about the quality of care at their local hospitals , as well as taking tough action where standards are n’t up to scratch			1
’ @entity123 , chief executive of charity @entity124 , said : ‘ the results may be worrying , but we very much welcome the more proactive approach by @entity40 which is more likely to identify dangerous trusts			0
‘ what we most need now is action to put things right – before more patients are needlessly harmed			0
’ @entity132 , chief executive of the @entity133 , said the report was ‘ hugely worrying ’ but matched the complaints they had received which suggested poor care was widespread in the @entity3			1
however @entity13 ’s health spokesman @entity138 blamed the problems on a lack of frontline cash , criticising the government for spending money on reorganisation			2
he said : ‘ hospitals were left on a financial knife - edge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos			2
‘ almost 6,000 nursing jobs have been axed since the election and @entity14 presided over the first summer @entity153 crisis in living memory			2
’ but a @entity156 spokesman defended the new inspection regime , saying : ‘ following the @entity158 , the @entity40 has introduced radical changes to hospital inspections			0
‘ a new chief inspector , sir @entity106 , is leading significantly larger inspection teams which are headed up by clinical and other experts			0
this next step will help to give the @entity40 a good picture of risk within trusts			0
’ they added : ‘ patient safety should be the first in everything the @entity3 does and we expect the @entity40 to act where it finds failings of care			1
’ @entity177 is at high risk on whistleblowing , knee replacement and hernia surgery , @entity153 waiting times and poor patient experience the @entity40 has placed all 161 @entity3 trusts in @entity7 in one of six ‘ risk ’ bands			1
1 is the worst and 6 the best , based on 150 indicators on the quality , safety and effectiveness of care			1
in all 27 per cent are in the bottom two bands , including : band 1 : @entity194 @entity195 @entity177 @entity197 and @entity196 @entity198 @entity199 @entity200 @entity201 @entity202 @entity204 and @entity203 @entity205 @entity206 @entity207 @entity208 @entity99 @entity209 @entity210 @entity211 @entity212 @entity213 the @entity214 the @entity216 and @entity215 @entity217 @entity218 band 2 : @entity219 @entity220 @entity221 and @entity222 @entity223 @entity224 @entity225 @entity227 and @entity226 @entity228 @entity229 @entity230 @entity231 and @entity232 @entity233 @entity234 @entity235 @entity236 @entity237 @entity238 and @entity239 @entity240 @entity241 @entity242			0
