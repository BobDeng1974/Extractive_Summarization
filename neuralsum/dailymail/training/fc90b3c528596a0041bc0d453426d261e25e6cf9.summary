by @entity1 reporter the exhaustive search operation for the @entity3 has resumed this morning in much clearer weather , with air teams joined by both military and commercial ships as officials scramble to cover the 600,000 square - kilometre search area			1
@entity10 is leading a new and exhaustive operation some 2,500 kilometres ( 1,500 miles ) south - west of @entity12 after @entity14 satellite imagery picked up two large objects – one up to 24 metres ( 78ft ) in length – on the outer edge of the southern search corridor			1
officials are preparing for the worst possible news , with several aviation experts now claiming the remote location of the debris would almost - certainly point to deliberate cockpit intervention , either by the pilots , the crew or passengers			1
pictured : satellite pictures released by the @entity35 of the object thought to be related to the search for @entity3 @entity39 general manager @entity38 describes to media the satellite imagery of two objects possibly related to the search for @entity3 aviation expert @entity44 says he 's confident that , whether it 's an act of terrorism or activism , the disappearance of @entity3 was well planned @entity44 , chairman of @entity48 , told @entity49 this morning that he was convinced that what had happened to @entity3 was n't an accident , and said the evidence pointed to the plane 's crew being involved			1
' i think it 's been put there either by one of the crew or both , and they 've picked an area where the aircraft wo n't be found , ' mr @entity44 said			1
' this was a crew - related incident			0
it was n't a catastrophic explosion			0
it was n't hit by military ordnance			0
' [ the debris is ] in about 10,000ft of water			1
in that part of the world there 's currents			0
' whether it 's terrorism or activism , it 's certainly something that has been well structured and well planned			2
' mr @entity44 pointed to the amount of fuel likely on board the @entity79 777 - 200 , at nearly full capacity with 31,000 gallons instead of the 45 per cent loading required to pilot a flight from @entity82 to @entity83 , as being a strong indicator that @entity3 's disappearance was not accidental			1
he added that given the location of the debris , the plane very well could have headed for mainland @entity10 , blaming the co-ordination effort in @entity90 for the slow and frustrating search			2
under the microscope : investigators consider the possibility of deliberate intervention by the @entity3 pilots , captain @entity3 ( @entity97 ) and @entity3 @entity99 pilot , flight lieutenant @entity100 steers the @entity101 during the search for missing @entity3 ' this aircraft has been positioned to where it is ; it could as easily , more frighteningly , have been positioned to the centre of @entity10 , ' mr @entity44 said			1
' [ @entity90 investigators ] have never had control of this incident from the time the passenger manifest was never checked against the stolen passport			0
' we 've only seriously been involved for really five for six days			0
we were all out looking in the @entity113 and the @entity114 until they realised they did n't have a clue			0
' a statement from the @entity35 said four planes had searched an area of 8,800 square miles ( 23,000 square kilometres ) about 1,550 miles ( 2,500m ) south - west of @entity12 without success			2
the area is about halfway between @entity10 and desolate islands off the @entity124 – one of the most remote locations on the planet			0
an @entity99 @entity101 is one of the @entity10 aircraft scouring the new search zone in the southern @entity131 the difficult search operation , led by military aircraft from @entity10 , @entity134 and the @entity14 , was hampered by poor visibility , challenging weather conditions and its proximity from land			1
but officials said the weather had cleared considerably this morning			2
it takes an @entity10 search plane , the @entity143 , four hours to arrive at the debris search area from @entity146 air base , and the aircraft can only spend two hours scouring the area before needing to return to @entity12			1
mr @entity44 suggests the pilots on @entity3 may have used this knowledge to their advantage and dropped the plane in a part of the ocean it would never be found			1
' if i was trying to lose an aircraft , and make sure there was no evidence ... you 'd certainly be looking to put the aircraft it in very , very deep water a long way from land , ' he said			0
' in the end if it is in the area it 's only going to be found by sonar and other maritime assets , not by aircraft assets			0
' there 's unlikely to be any naval ships in the area [ for days ]			0
you 've almost been able to put it ( @entity3 ) in with little chance of anything floating up too quickly to be able to isolate the wreck			0
' @entity10 prime minister @entity180 announced in @entity181 on thursday that new and credible information had come to light in the search for @entity3			2

aviation expert says the search area increases *likelihood* that @entity3 pilots deliberately flew plane off course
expert @entity44 says : ' this was well structured and well planned '
the ten - hour search in southern @entity131 was called off in difficult weather conditions ; has resumed this morning
air teams have been joined by both military and commercial ships
debris likely to be in 10,000ft of water and unlikely to be visible from the air
