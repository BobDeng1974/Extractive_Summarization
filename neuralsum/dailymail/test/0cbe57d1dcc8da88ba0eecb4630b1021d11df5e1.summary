most afternoons , after the players had drifted away from @entity3 's training centre , @entity0 would sit for hours with his coaches @entity5 and @entity7 in the staff canteen			1
they were always together , forming an alliance after @entity3 chairman @entity10 made @entity0 responsible for the club 's youth and under 21 programmes in 2008			2
on tuesday evening they will be in opposing dug - outs at @entity16 , trying to lead their teams away from relegation danger in these final , fraught weeks of the @entity21 season			1
@entity0 ( from left to right ) , @entity7 and @entity5 during their time at @entity24 @entity0 ( right ) sits on the bench with @entity3 staff @entity7 ( centre ) and @entity5 ( left ) @entity3 striker @entity27 celebrates his goal by saluting @entity29 ( right ) and @entity5 ( centre ) whatever happens between @entity29 's @entity32 and @entity5 's @entity33 , where @entity7 is now head of football operations , the three men will remain firm friends			1
the bond is strong even if @entity0 is blocking @entity5 's mobile phone calls temporarily			1
' what would we talk about ? ' said @entity0 on monday			2
' you ca n't share team notes			0
i keep red - buttoning him ! all we could say is , " how 's the family , are you all right ? ok , see you tuesday "			2
' @entity0 and @entity5 forged their friendship at @entity3			1
someone , somewhere is always working an angle with @entity10 , but they looked out for each other at a club regarded as the most political in the @entity56 top flight			0
intriguingly , @entity0 hinted on monday that if @entity5 's tenure at @entity58 proves short - lived , he would ask to bring him to @entity32			1
' i would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here , ' confirmed @entity0			2
' i know i 'm biased but he is up there with the very best coaches i have ever seen			0
' he is a street kid			0
he knows how to talk to them			0
you could ask him two minutes before to put on a session for 40 players and he could do it			0
' @entity0 and @entity5 are credited with guiding some of the brightest young talents at @entity3 and helping them break into the first team			1
@entity0 and @entity5 forged their friendship at @entity3 and remain close ahead of their showdown the bond between the two remains strong even if @entity0 is blocking @entity5 's mobile phone calls for now @entity0 hinted that if @entity5 's tenure at @entity58 ends , then he would ask to bring him to @entity16 @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , who all played in @entity84 's 1 - 1 draw in @entity85 last week , were brought through @entity3 's youth system by this coaching collective			1
some at @entity3 bridle at the idea that the trio are wholly responsible for their development , but you ca n't deny their influence			0
next season , for example , @entity84 under 21 midfielder @entity95 will return from his loan at @entity99 and is expected to be named in @entity3 's 25 - man first - team squad			0
@entity101 , who made his debut for @entity3 in january and also captains the youth team , is another discovery			0
@entity0 took to @entity5 when he was gaining knowledge of youth football after he accepted a new role at @entity3 in 2012			1
@entity5 , who played right back for @entity108 in the 2 - 2 draw with @entity110 in the 1983 fa cup final , was brought into @entity3 in 2005 by academy director @entity112 and initially assigned to the under 14 team			0
the pair had met at the @entity111 , where @entity5 had worked after an ill - fated coaching spell alongside former @entity117 player @entity116 at @entity118			0
@entity5 still lives in @entity119 , a short drive from @entity0 's imposing house in @entity122 , @entity123 , which he bought when he was a @entity124 player			1
@entity5 pictured on the touchline during a @entity33 match as he tries to save the club from relegation @entity5 must put his friendship with @entity0 on ice for the time being as he tries to see off his pal 's team @entity5 still lives in @entity119 - a short drive from @entity0 's imposing house in @entity123 when @entity0 accepted his role as development co-ordinator , shipping players out on loan to gain experience ( often to @entity142 , where @entity143 , a friend from his playing days at @entity144 , is chairman ) , @entity3 's players flourished			1
on matchdays he often scouted players with @entity7			0
as they became more involved with youth development , preferring to educate their own players rather than recruit expensive youngsters , they gained @entity10 's trust			0
when @entity152 pushed the self - destruct button in december 2013 , all three moved into the dug - out following @entity0 's appointment			2
it was short - lived			0
@entity0 and his staff left at the end of the season after @entity10 opted for @entity159			2
@entity0 was expected to follow @entity7 and @entity5 to @entity33 when @entity160 quit			1
but he had also struck up a relationship with @entity32 director of recruitment @entity162 and that is the reason @entity0 and @entity5 face each other on tuesday night .			1

@entity32 manager @entity0 faces @entity5 's @entity33 on tuesday
