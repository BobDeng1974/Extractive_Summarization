by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor , in @entity2 , @entity3			2
published : 00:48 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 18:34 est , 14 march 2014 @entity5 , the former @entity1 senator from @entity6 , started his trek back to the @entity8 on friday after a party official introduced him as ' @entity5 of @entity3			1
' ' a political wave is coming ... @entity12 @entity11 are on the wrong side of that wave , ' @entity5 told a capacity crowd in @entity2 on friday during the @entity16			1
' if we do n't like @entity18 , we can get rid of it			0
... the party that put everything on the line for the takeover of our very good health care system has a lot to answer for			0
' a 2013 move to his family 's vacation home in @entity30 , @entity3 has made it possible for him to reclaim his old job while representing a different state – much like how former secretary of state @entity34 moved to @entity35 in 2000 in order to take advantage of a looming @entity8 election there			1
' and that 's to get rid of the @entity12 @entity11 who rammed it through @entity59 and forced it down the throats of the @entity1 people			0
' @entity5 blamed @entity11 for most of @entity63 's chronic dysfunction , saying majority leader @entity64 and his allies have stifled their opponents ' efforts to moderate some of the president 's policies			2
' it 's been " my way or the highway , " and i 'm tired of it , ' @entity5 boomed			2
' it 's time for the whole crowd to go			0
' the former senator , who swept into @entity63 in 2010 as a surprise replacement for the recently deceased @entity50 lion @entity80 , is now poised to give first - term @entity50 sen. @entity49 a tough re-election fight			1
but the ' carpetbagger ' label will dog him the same way it did mrs. @entity34 14 years ago			0
the @entity3 @entity50 was waiting for @entity5 in the tall grass , and quickly released a @entity89 video friday after his announcement , chronicling his past statements about his pride in being from @entity6			1
' i 'll probably die here , ' he says in one clip			0
but on friday @entity5 took every opportunity to paint himself as a @entity3 - born child from the wrong side of the tracks , sounding like a candidate from the beginning of his 18 - minute speech			1
he lived in 17 different homes by the time he was 18 years old , @entity5 said , in a soft voice that countered the impression left by his towering height			1
his parents were each ' married and divorced 4 times , ' he said , working from notes but scanning the crowd – not a teleprompter			0
@entity5 himself has been married to one woman for nearly 30 years			2
@entity5 lost his only bid to defend his @entity8 seat in 2012 , when liberal 's liberal @entity116 swept him aside as part of @entity12 's re-election year dark horse : @entity5 wants to join a handful of politicians who have represented two or more states in the @entity8 , but first he will have to beat the popular @entity124 @entity49 the @entity125 canceled @entity5 's on - air contributor contract earlier in the afternoon , as is their custom , when he informed the management there that he would be running for office			1
he would n't be the first person to serve in the @entity8 from more than one state			2
but sen. @entity134 ' record of three states – @entity136 , @entity137 , and @entity138 – appears safe unless the @entity139 pays his realtor overtime			2
@entity141 confirmed thursday that @entity5 would make the move			2
@entity143 , executive director of the @entity3 @entity144 , shrugged around midnight and said that ' it 's a rumor right now			0
' but two other sources had confirmed that @entity5 would use his @entity2 speaking engagement as a launching pad			1
it 's there that he announced on friday afternoon that he 's formed an exploratory committee , a necessary step before he can legally hire staffers to massage the media , poll @entity3 's voters and craft a strategy for unseating @entity49 in november			1
no one knows how @entity5 , the former @entity6 senator , will do in @entity3 , but he 's the @entity139 's most recognizable candidate and one of its most congenial and photogenic speakers the @entity161 had reported that @entity5 's political action committee had sent a total of $ 29,000 to a group of @entity139 committees			1
those checks included $ 5,000 contributions to the @entity3 state party , and the @entity8 and @entity169			0
while passing the hat is a time - tested proposition for political players , @entity5 aims to double down on his unconventional 2010 victory over @entity50 massachusetts attorney general @entity174 , whom he trailed for most of the special - election campaign season			1
in @entity3 , too , @entity5 is already behind the eight - ball			2
a @entity178 poll released march 6 showed sen. @entity49 with a 13 - point edge , 52 to 39 , among likely voters			0
but those percentages are soft since @entity5 's candidacy was hypothetical , and because they followed on the heels of $ 360,000 in negative ads run against him in january and february by @entity11 and liberal special interests who were spooked by the idea			0
@entity5 's near - universal name recognition will perk up his numbers now that he has officially entered the race , @entity139 hope , and they expect outside conservatives like @entity193 to continue advertising heavily against @entity49 for her cozy relationship with the increasingly unpopular president @entity12			1
for now , he 's banking on a groundswell of support from breathless @entity139 buoyed by the possibility of a return to the majority in the @entity8			1
the @entity139 needs to capture six @entity124 - held seats this year to wrest control from majority leader @entity64			1
if he wins in @entity3 – provided he survives a cakewalk primary – @entity5 could flip the final seat republicans want			2
in 2010 he was hailed on the right as a latter - day savior because @entity11 had passed the @entity18 , but would need to hold a re-vote after the @entity208 made its own alterations			2
@entity6 gov. @entity210 had appointed @entity211 , a former @entity212 chairman and a one - time @entity80 aide , as an interim senator , and @entity211 voted yes			1
political melting pot : just like @entity218 gov. @entity218 's performance in blue - state @entity219 depends on working with a @entity124 - controlled legislature , @entity5 had to work with liberals including fellow senator @entity223 , the future secretary of state with @entity5 replacing @entity211 after his election , @entity139 suddenly had enough votes to filibuster the @entity18 law when it came back from the @entity208			1
@entity64 and then - speaker @entity227 had an answer : the law was bundled with a host of other legislation and passed in the @entity8 a second time through a process known as reconciliation – which is n't subject to filibustering			2
this time @entity5 could push the @entity139 over the top in the upper chamber of @entity59 , effectively stymieing president @entity12 's agenda during his lame - duck years			1
but first he needs to win			0
@entity5 said friday that his wife @entity238 had urged him to ' stop complaining ' and ' run for the @entity8 in @entity3 ' @entity3 @entity139 have already pulled off one upset this year , in a statewide election for a seat on the @entity242 – a five - member panel that serves as a mixed - party privy council to the governor , approving appointees and green - lighting spending proposals once the legislature has appropriated money			1
on tuesday @entity139 @entity251 defeated democrat @entity252 in a special election for one of those five executive council seats , winning by 1,267 votes in a race he was expected to lose			0
@entity5 , a state party official told @entity141 , wants to harness the sudden boost of energy to send him back to the @entity8 , this time for a full term			1
' i mean , look what we just did , ' the official said			0
' now i 'm not saying @entity5 will pull off the same upset , but god , i hope he does			0
everyone in @entity3 knows who he is already , and @entity49 voted for @entity18			0
' ' we really should be able to win this one			0
' at an event where long - shot presidential hopefuls are consuming most of the oxygen – @entity276 host @entity275 , @entity278 gov. @entity277 and former @entity280 sen. @entity279 will make appearances – @entity5 's plunge back into a campaign with national implications has turned the event from a second - tier dog and pony show into a key feature of the @entity139 's plan to re-take the @entity8			1
before @entity5 's plans were leaked on thursday , @entity290 was the talk of @entity2			1
the former congressman has toyed with running for president , but this weekend will mark the first time he is included in a straw poll alongside serious contenders like @entity279 , @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300 , all senators who will share the ballot with @entity139 governors @entity218 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity277			0
but the biggest crowd so far has been for the man who as a part - time model once appeared naked in @entity310 , his modesty preserved only by creative cropping at the bottom of a centerfold			0
' he 's a handsome guy , ' offered a @entity2 hotel guest who identified herself only as ' @entity316 from @entity317			0
' ' i 'd vote for him , ' she chuckled			0
' just do n't tell my husband			0

the @entity322 - born @entity139 won a @entity6 *shocker* in 2010 to replace the late @entity50 sen. @entity80
he lost his seat two years later to far - left @entity124 @entity116
now @entity5 has moved a few miles north and has launched an ' exploratory campaign ' for his return to the @entity8
he made it official late friday afternoon during a @entity2 , @entity333 *conference*
