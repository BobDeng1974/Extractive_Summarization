by @entity0 one of the holy grails of energy generation has long been fusion power , replicating the reactions that take place in stars like the sun. so far such efforts have proved very difficult – but one company claims to have found a solution that could provide the world with a huge , renewable and green source of energy			1
the @entity15 project is entering its final phase , with scientists aiming to prove that their concept really works			1
they have already successfully heated fusion fuel 200 times hotter than the centre of the sun , and now plan to increase the density with sufficient funding the project is being run by @entity20 ( @entity34 ) by chief scientist @entity20			1
they are currently running a fundraiser on @entity37 to seek money for what they claims is the last step in their research			1
at the heart of the dense plasma focus are two cylindrical electrodes only a few inches across nested inside each other			2
the electrodes are enclosed in a vacuum chamber , with a low pressure gas filling the space between them			2
a pulse of electricity from a capacitor bank and energy storage device is discharged across the electrodes			2
for a few millionths of a second an intense current flows from the outer to the inner electrodes and ionises the gas			2
@entity64 first compress the plasma into dense filaments			0
these filaments are whirlwinds of current			0
the sheath of filaments merges together in a dense pinch or focus , combining all the filaments into one			2
this filament kicks and twists itself into a tiny dense ball , only a few thousands of an inch across called a plasmoid			0
instability in the plasmoid creates powerful beams in opposite directions			0
positively charged nuclei stream in one direction , and electrons in the other			0
rapid compression heats the trapped plasma to billions of degrees , hot enough to fuse nuclei together to release fusion energy			1
they have passed two of their goals to proving their method of fusion power is successful , with a third apparently within reach			1
in a march 2012 paper the team successfully heated fusion fuel up to 1.8 billion degrees – too times hotter than the centre of the sun. this was confined within a tiny plasmoid for 10 billionths of a second , a short amount of time but enough to achieve this goal			1
their next step is to increase the density of the fuel 10,000-fold , which they plan to do in the next 18 months			1
‘ our team fully supports using today 's existing renewable energy technologies like wind and solar , but it is clear we need even greener , more affordable energy solutions , ’ the company says on @entity37			1
‘ some 20 per centof the global population is without electricity , while almost half of the world lives on less than $ 2.50 [ £ 1.50 ] per day			0
‘ @entity126 forecasts that 1.2 billion people will remain without electricity			0
‘ they say their system would not only stop climate change by lowering the emission of greenhouse gases , but it would also provide nuclear power without nuclear waste			0
current nuclear plants , they say , are based around nuclear fission , which produces as a waste product long - lived radioactive waste			0
fusion energy , meanwhile , is comparatively ‘ clean ’			1
but , as @entity34 says , governments around the world ‘ have spent billions of dollars on fusion with little to no success			2
’ @entity154 claim that theres there innovation will provider cheaper and cleaner energy for all , doing away with nuclear waste ( nuclear plant pictured ) and other pollutants that contribute to climate change and cause other problems			1
they also say their system could allow for smaller power stations that are decentralised so what makes them think they ’ll be successful ? ‘ first , we ’re using the natural instabilities of plasmas to concentrate the energy , ’ they write			1
‘ we ’re using the same processes , like the pinch effect , that occur in solar flares and other astronomical phenomena , but scaling them down to laboratory size			0
‘ the government - sponsored programmes have been fighting these instabilities			0
so they have taken a far more difficult route			0
‘ ours is much easier since we are using natural processes , not fighting them			0
‘ second , it does n’t always take billions to get earth - shaking inventions			0
‘ the first airplane cost $ 30,000 [ £ 17,900 ] in today ’s dollars , and the first transistor was built by a team of three who only spent two years working on it			0
in march 2012 the team published their first research in the journal @entity187			1
at the time the group came under some criticism for the paper , notably from @entity191 , the ceo of @entity192 , a manufacturer of plasma diagnostic equipment			0
‘ i am not expecting to see fusion energy from @entity20 , @entity197 , despite the fanfare , ’ he wrote on his website			2
@entity34 , however , are confident their method will work , or at the very least provide useful research into fusion reactions			2
fusion power is seen as being very appealing as it mimics the huge energy - generating process that takes place in the centre of stars ( illustration shown )			1
many experts say that if true nuclear fusion can be achieved , it will provide us with a much cleaner and greener source of energy than anything currently available			1

@entity217 company @entity154 claims to be on the *brink* of solving fusion
they say they are one step away from making cleaner and greener energy
in march 2012 they performed a successful test of their concept
this involved heating fusion fuel to 200 times the *temperature* at the centre of the sun
next step is to increase the density and prove their focus fusion works
