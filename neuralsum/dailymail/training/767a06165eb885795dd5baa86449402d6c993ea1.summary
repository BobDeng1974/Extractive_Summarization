thirteen years ago , on my 60th birthday , i decided to go clothes shopping			1
it 's not a pastime i 've ever particularly enjoyed , finding it boringly time - consuming , but my husband @entity6 is always encouraging me to treat myself , so off i went			2
i 'd been feeling a little low about hitting this particular milestone birthday			2
not many women like the sound of ' sixtysomething '			1
but as i fingered the rails at the @entity12 , a fantastic @entity13 - based club who hold a knock - down sale at @entity16 , i spotted them almost immediately			2
there they were - tight - fitting snakeskin trousers , the sort that would look more at home on a @entity22 ( @entity23 ) or a @entity24 ( @entity21 )			2
daring to wear : sandra in dungarees and a patterned dress as she has become more bold in her 70s certainly not the sort one would associate with a sexagenarian			1
but i had not come shopping with the intention of allowing age to let me slip into sartorial obscurity			1
i had come to make a statement , and i would be making it with leather , printed leather			2
they slid on and fitted perfectly and , after a cursory check of my rear view using my trusted compact mirror , i handed over Â£ 100 - far more than i am usually comfortable spending on a single item , but what the hell ! i showed them to my husband who thought they were great fun , and i felt on top of the world			2
i could n't help but smile			1
and i smiled again when i saw 55 - year - old @entity53 on the red carpet last week , positively radiating confidence			1
arriving at the premiere of her new film @entity57 in a vibrant red dress and patterned scarf , she was anything but conventional - but she looked glorious			1
approval : @entity63 's husband @entity62 is a fan of her fun fashion choices oscar - winner @entity53 tends to play rather prim roles			1
this outfit was anything but			2
cut down to the ankles , it looked feminine and the scarf was cut on the bias , adding an even more eccentric feel			2
she teamed those with a multi-coloured chain necklace and patent bronze heels , as well as black glasses			2
her blonde hair was scraped back off her face			2
as she shot the photographers a wide grin and then went to greet her fans , i thought she looked marvellous			2
it 's not that long ago that women of a certain age had to conform to a rigid style canon which set out skirt length ( below the knee ) and appropriate evening wear ( never trousers )			1
my own mother , like most wartime women , wore the same clothes all her life - plain wool skirt , plain blouse or jumper			1
now , things are different			0
we can wear jeans to red carpet events			0
clashing colours are considered stylish			1
why should n't that freedom extend to women over 50 ? since that day with the snakeskin trousers , i look for clothes that make me stand out			1
rifling through my drawers you 'll find a pair of shocking pink sunglasses bought in @entity113 for one euro that i wear all the time			0
fab fashionistas : @entity63 admired @entity53 's recent red carpet look , left , and always thinks @entity118 looks good there are emerald green jeans by @entity121 i bought at the @entity122			1
i wear them to all kinds of events , including cruises			0
i have sparkly white jeans and a splashy @entity129 black - and - white dress i wear for book talks			1
it never fails to make me feel wonderful - especially when i team it with bright orange toenails			0
it seems that i 'm in great company when it comes to shattering convention in my later years			0
@entity118 , who is nearing 80 , looks terrific in everything			1
although @entity139 is a mere 48 , i ca n't imagine her clothes will become any less outrageous as she hits her 50s			1
indeed , many of my friends believe that fashion gets more fun as you get older			0
i have one incredible barrister friend in her 60s who regularly wears sparkly cowboy boots and wild headbands			0
another friend , @entity151 , is instinctively stylish and throws together wonderfully exotic and original clothes			1
of course there are moments when i think , ' oh ... dear			0
' but if i 'm in doubt , i canvass the opinion of one of my two sons , @entity159 , 51 , or @entity160 , 38			0
they either say : ' yes , mum you look great ' , or ' no , you ca n't be seen in that '			1
i 'm happy to discard something on their advice			0
it might seem like a double standard , but the key - i believe - to carrying off an outrageous look is feeling confident			0
and that means knowing when to say no. accessorise : @entity63 got lots of compliments when she wore this chunky necklace recently when i was 70 , i did a shoot for a woman 's magazine and they produced a pair of really tight skinny jeans			0
i said i could n't possibly wear them as they 'd make my hips look huge			1
the stylists then produced a long flowing grey top and a crocheted silver - threaded cardigan to lay over them - and i felt incredible			0
there are times when i hold back			0
there comes a point in every woman 's life where your upper knees and arms are no longer a thing of beauty and there 's nothing you can do about it			0
many is the time i 've tried on a sleeveless dress or a skirt that is just a little too short and it 's come straight off again			1
but even then , when a style has really suited me , i 've broken my own rules			1
i 've got a fantastic black leather dress which i adore and that has no sleeves			1
jeans can be particularly cruel , so when you find a pair that suit , treasure them			0
there is another myth about fashion and growing older			0
some women claim that they no longer need to dress to impress , but to that i say , poppycock ! we still want to turn a head or two , even though we can claim a bus pass			1
some people might accuse me of being disingenuous			0
being a slim size 10 - or a size 12 on some days - and a former fashion model means i 've always been a bit of a clothes horse			1
but that 's missing the point			0
i know plenty of people who are wide , small , fat , thin and can wear wonderfully outrageous clothes			1
it 's not about size			0
my advice to any woman wanting to break the fashion mould is to start off small , perhaps by accessorising an outfit with some offbeat clunky jewellery and just see how many compliments you pick up			0
@entity6 is always buying me bits of over-sized jewellery			0
i wore a fabulous chunky colourful necklace to the @entity246 recently and so many people told me how terrific it looked			0
focus on your best feature			0
i have a small waist so wear clothes that show that off			1
but i hate my legs and prefer to draw attention away from those - wearing cut - off trousers with orange toenails peeping through distracts wonderfully			0
get your colours ' done '			2
i went to a charity coffee morning a few years ago where a few friends and i had it done and was told that i suited zingy oranges and brilliant yellows			0
i could immediately see the difference , these colours ' lifted ' me and i wear them regularly now			2
but most of all , be brave			0
when you look in the mirror and you 're not sure if those jeans or that top are suitable for your age , say those four magic words ' to hell with it ' and walk out into the world			2
i promise , you 'll look fantastic - just like @entity53 !			1

model thinks women should n't fade away as they age
can still dress to impress in trendy clothes and bold colours
