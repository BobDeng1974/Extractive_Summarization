sir @entity0 made a phone call to @entity2 as part of a desperate attempt to keep @entity5 in the 1999 - 2000 @entity6 , a man close to the talks has revealed			1
but the then prime minister was about to go into a meeting with @entity12 president @entity11 in a bid to bring an end to the raging war in @entity16 and could not speak			1
as a result , sir @entity0 admitted defeat and @entity5 ended up going to @entity21 's inaugural @entity20 in @entity22 in an attempt to boost the @entity6 's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win the right to host the 2006 @entity26 , and pulling out of a competition they had won a year previously			1
sir @entity0 ( right ) asked @entity2 ( left ) if @entity5 could compete in the 1999 - 2000 @entity6 @entity5 were asked by @entity2 's envoy to play at the inaugural @entity20 in 2000 @entity5 withdrew from the 1999 - 2000 @entity6 in order to help the @entity6 's bid to host the 2006 @entity26 @entity32 is now general manager at @entity33 , the club set up in protest at the @entity37 family 's takeover of @entity5 in 2005 who are set to move to a new home in april			1
but in june of 1999 he was an member of the influential @entity40 and in regular contact with the fiery @entity42			0
@entity32 , who made the revelation in an interview with the fanzine @entity45 , explained the unlikely story to @entity48			0
' @entity5 came out as the villains in all of it , ' @entity32 said			0
' but both sir @entity0 and then chairman @entity51 were under incredible pressure from @entity53 , the prime minister 's envoy for the @entity26 bid , and from @entity56 , the @entity6 's acting chief executive to pull out of the @entity6 and go to @entity22 for the @entity21 tournament			1
' as fans we wanted to find ways of keeping them in the @entity6 and we thought we had come up with a solution			0
' it involved moving some of the fixtures to earlier in the season and creating a gap before @entity5 were due to go in january during which , if the @entity6 would move the tie , they could play their third round cup match			1
' @entity5 were under pressure to withdraw from the @entity6 , according to @entity32 ( centre ) @entity32 explained that the plan had gathered momentum , but added that things took a turn for the worse at the @entity76			2
' we were playing @entity78 and @entity51 was sat next to the new @entity79 , @entity80			0
she made some remark along the lines of " i believe you 're ruining this season 's @entity6 " and when word of that got back to @entity0 he was furious			1
' i spoke to him over the phone and he said : " that 's it , they 're forcing us out			0
f * * * them			0
we 're going to @entity22 and that 's the end of it "			0
' then he told me that he had tried to call @entity2 and he could n't sort it			0
' i 'd seen @entity2 on the news that morning going to @entity12 so i asked @entity0 what had been said			1
' he told me that @entity2 had told him he was about to go into a meeting with @entity11 and that was the end of it			2
' @entity2 could not answer @entity0 's request as he was about to speak to @entity11 ( pictured ) the saga turned into a disaster all around , with @entity108 's @entity26 bid failing and @entity5 drawing with @entity110 @entity109 ( with @entity111 sent off and @entity0 sent to the stands for complaining about the decision ) and defeated by @entity22 @entity114			1
sir @entity0 would have the last laugh , however , with his side returning to @entity108 to romp to the @entity119 title , finishing 18 points ahead of @entity78			2
in the summer of 1999 peacekeepers entered @entity16 as @entity11 's forces withdrew			2
he would eventually be found dead in his cell in 2006 during a war crimes prosecution at the @entity125 at which he was defending himself .			0
