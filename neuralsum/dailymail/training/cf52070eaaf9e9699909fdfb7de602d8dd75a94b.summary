agony aunt @entity0 said women who meet men online could be putting themselves in danger women who use dating websites risk attracting sexual predators – because they are unable to ' smell ' their potential suitors , a leading agony aunt claimed yesterday			1
@entity0 said women who meet men online could be putting themselves in danger because the use of technology robs them of their natural ability to sense a threat			1
the 78 - year - old , who has been writing advice columns in @entity18 for over 40 years , said she is inundated with letters from women claiming they have fallen in love with someone they met over the internet			1
speaking at the @entity25 , supported by the @entity26 , she said : ' the problem with social media – and i 'm not a luddite , technology is really important – but the problem is that it leads so easily to wishful thinking , and wishful thinking is two inches away from lying and lying is right next door to lying to oneself			1
' so i think the online world is making some more problems			2
women are so eager to find what they 're looking for , they want to find it and they think they 've found it , but they have n't			1
' increasingly young women write to me to say they 've fallen in love with someone who lives many miles away ' but i do love him , i am in love with him '			1
' and my reply is you ca n't love someone you 've never smelled			2
we must n't lose intuition and what we know			2
it 's dangerous in both senses			2
i worry about online connections			0
' while miss @entity0 's views may sound a little unusual , they could have a scientific basis			1
according to a recent book , the @entity63 by professor @entity64 , a person 's scent is one of the most revealing things about them because it is directly linked to their immune system			0
the book claims many women rate smell as more important than visual cues when it comes to sexual arousal and choice of lover			1
women who use dating websites risk attracting sexual predators – because they are unable to ' smell ' their potential suitors , according to the advice columnist miss @entity0 , who was publicising her latest book , my life in agony , said women should not forget to rely on their intuition , because it keeps them safe			1
she said : ' when i was a kid in @entity89 going to school , i 'd be walking along with my friends , on the @entity93 streets			0
' and you 'd see a guy coming towards you and without a word we 'd just cross the street			0
it was n't even ' hey i do n't like the look of him ' and then cross the street , it was just you crossed the street			0
' i get a feeling now that people are so busy punching in messages in their portable machines that they 're forgetting where they 're going			0
' do n't lose your ability to make judgments			1
and do n't move too fast , especially when it comes to guys			0
just eyes open , and slow down			0
and that does also mean watch the booze and the drugs			0
' it is not the first time @entity119 has suggested women have the power to prevent themselves ending up in compromising situations			2
earlier this year she faced a backlash after saying women should not get drunk around men because it puts them at risk of being raped			1
she said the onus was on the woman to protect herself from danger and suggested always taking a friend when meeting an online date for the first time			0
she said : ' i think you avoid meeting the guy , especially if it entails a journey , without somebody else – get a friend to come with you			0
i do n't think you go and meet a strange man , even if you 've met him online and you think you know him … you do n't know him until you get a sniff of him			0
' miss @entity0 , who has a son , worked as a journalist for 1960s magazine @entity147 , before joining @entity18 as agony aunt in 1973			1
her literary catalogue includes two novels , three travel books and three self - help manuals .			2
