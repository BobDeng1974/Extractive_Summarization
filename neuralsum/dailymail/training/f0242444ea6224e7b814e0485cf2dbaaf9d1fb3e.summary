by @entity0 published : 23:21 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 03:53 est , 15 january 2014 with £ 2 million to spend , a house buyer might expect to be able to find something rather spectacular			2
but those shopping around the @entity6 area of @entity7 should think again			1
these pictures show the £ 2 million , two - bedroom home which even estate agents admit is a ' wreck '			0
this @entity7 property , which even estate agents admit is a ' wreck ' , went on the market for £ 2 million while it may look respectable from the front - situated at the end of a tidy row of terraced homes near @entity20 - the inside of the home tells a different story			1
behind the smart front door , potential buyers are met with exposed brickwork , tired floorboards and crumbling plaster			1
even the estate agent , @entity29 , described the house as ‘ wrecksville ’ and warned potential buyers that it would cost a fortune to renovate			1
for the same price , a nine - bedroom , @entity35 - listed home could be bought with @entity37 in @entity38			0
in @entity41 , meanwhile , a collection of 37 properties are being offered to buyers for the same price by one business			2
and in @entity46 , a two - bedroom home requiring full restoration would set a buyer back approximately £ 100,000			2
but despite the home costing 11 times the average across @entity50 and @entity51 , there was said to be no shortage of interest			0
behind the front door , guests are met with exposed brickwork , tired floorboards and crumbling plaster while it may look respectable from the front - situated at the end of a tidy row of terraced homes near to @entity20 - the inside tells a different story the home , on @entity65 , is just off @entity67 and a short distance from @entity20 and some of @entity7 's best - known areas			1
floorplans show it currently has two bedrooms and three reception rooms			0
@entity29 described the property as a ‘ complete wreck in one of @entity7 's great residential areas and everything to play for ’			1
the advert added : ‘ the property represents an epic opportunity to buy a shell , create the perfect space and live somewhere that is actually made for you			0
‘ it 's the sort of house where you can imagine retiring and pottering about in the village vibe that , amazingly , still exists in the quiet back streets of @entity6			1
’ while the front may look appealing , the view from the back garden gives a better indication of what lies inside @entity29 described it as a ' complete wreck in one of @entity7 's great residential areas and everything to play for ' the property is still advertised on the website of @entity29 and @entity101 with a ' sold ' sign			1
however , it is understood the owner has now decided to take the property off the market and renovate it themselves			0
last year , 193 houses in @entity6 sold for more than £ 1 million with an average price of £ 2.87 million			0
car parking spaces alone sell for £ 300,000 in the area			0
