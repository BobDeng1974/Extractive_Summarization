by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 19:13 est , 29 january 2014 regrets : @entity0 wishes she had never quit her job recently , seething after a blistering row with my husband @entity6 , i plotted my escape from our marriage			1
i imagined packing a case and taking our children @entity12 , 16 , and @entity13 , 13 , to a hotel			1
it ’s a scenario i ’ve played out numerous times in the aftermath of a marital humdinger but never actually made it a reality			1
why ? well , mostly because @entity6 and i do still love each other			1
but also , because i could n’t afford to leave if i wanted to			1
it ’s a situation in which i have felt trapped and one that sometimes leaves me frustrated and angry			1
i ’m sure many of my affluent friends , who are also stay - at - home mothers , share my misery			2
but it ’s something none of us dare express for fear of being labelled ungrateful			2
after all , women like me are living every female ’s dream			1
are n’t we ? with two happy , healthy children who gleefully greet me at the school gate each evening , a beautiful home and a supportive , successful husband , i know how lucky i am			2
but , before you pour scorn on me , please understand that i have come to this situation from a very unusual starting point : i gave up a successful , £ 80,000 - a - year career as a commercial lawyer to become a full - time mother and housewife			1
i did this even though for the early part of our marriage , i earned significantly more than @entity6			1
and , hard as it is to admit , ever since i gave up my job 13 years ago and accepted the household would be run with @entity6 ’s salary , i ’ve felt rather empty			1
while @entity6 is kind , generous and constantly assures me that it is our money not his i abhor the fact that i ’ve allowed myself to lose my financial independence			2
as much as being present for every violin concert and sports day has filled me with pride , and as much as my children have benefited from having me as a constant in their lives , i ca n’t help but feel that the price of their happiness was my own			2
and every time i spot a groomed career woman in her crisp @entity70 shirt and @entity72 suit , i feel a stab of envy , then guilt , as i creep back home to the detritus of domesticity			1
because , even though i know how it feels to be an exhausted working mother , having worked in the years after @entity12 was born , back then at least i had a sense of purpose			1
motherhood may be a privilege , but it simply can not replace the confidence i lost when i gave up my job			1
i look back at how @entity6 and i met as students at @entity87 in 1981 when we were both 21 and know that the younger me would never have imagined the future that transpired			2
@entity0 and @entity6 on their wedding day ( left ) never dreamt of a rockier future i ’d just graduated with a degree in law from @entity95			1
our jobs took us to @entity97 where we both worked in the @entity98			2
before long , we bought our first home			2
while @entity6 opted for litigation , i delved into the lucrative world of commercial law			2
i used to regularly take @entity103 to @entity104 or fly first class to @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 to sign off deals for my firms ’ clients , mostly pharmaceutical giants			2
i was frequently the only woman in the boardroom			2
even after our marriage in 1989 , children seemed a long way off			1
but , in 1994 , my younger sister @entity118 had a baby			2
as i held her daughter for the first time , her pudgy little fingers clasping my thumb , i instantly knew i wanted one , too			1
looking at @entity6 , joyously cradling his newborn niece in his arms , i knew he felt the same			2
we were both overjoyed when i fell pregnant in 1996 , when we were both 38			2
i worked until two weeks before the birth			2
@entity12 was born in may 1997 and within a few months i could n’t wait to get back to work , confident i could juggle baby and boardroom			2
i was back at my desk in november			0
three months later i left for a nine - day business trip to @entity107			0
@entity6 was actually very supportive of my decision to go			1
he knew how exhausting i ’d found juggling child and boardroom and saw the trip as me getting a bit of a break			0
his mother stayed at our house to care for @entity12			1
business class travel and luxury hotels were a welcome respite from nappies and baby food			0
@entity0 ( second left ) pictured with son @entity12 ( far left ) daughter @entity13 ( second right ) and husband @entity6 ( far left ) but when i returned home , @entity6 was cradling @entity12 on his shoulder , and my baby boy had a sad look on his little face that i ’ll never forget			1
and i was racked with guilt			0
over the next 15 months , @entity12 ’s grip on my heartstrings tightened			0
i dreaded the daily farewell at nursery , prising his tiny hands from my neck			0
at work , guilt and fatigue made it difficult to concentrate			0
keen to extend our family , i was delighted when i became pregnant again the following year			0
but this pregnancy — and two more quickly followed — demonstrated how little control i now had over my body and circumstances : i suffered three miscarriages within nine months , the last while i was sitting in a meeting in @entity97			0
distraught , i rang @entity6 on the train home and told him i was going to quit my job			1
put simply , i could n’t take any more — the demands were too great			0
@entity6 was calm and reassuring			0
i handed in my resignation the next day			0
looking back , i ’m incredulous that this was the extent of the discussion			0
secretly i suspect @entity6 was relieved that he would , finally be the breadwinner			0
happy times : @entity0 's marriage fell under strain following her decision to leave her job although my success and salary genuinely never caused a problem between us , he ’d had a very traditional upbringing with men being providers and protectors			1
two months later , @entity13 was conceived			0
keen to embrace my role as a full - time mum , in august 1999 we moved to a farmhouse in @entity199 to be close to my parents			1
@entity13 was born in april 2000 and initially i took to full - time motherhood gleefully , relishing the time with my children , and not having to express milk before going to the office			1
but @entity6 was either working 12 - hour days or staying in hotels near his office and i missed him terribly			0
around the same time , we were invited to a dinner party			1
i was sitting next to a rather pretentious stockbroker who asked me what i did			0
i said i was at home with the children and watched his eyes glaze			0
previously he was the kind of man i would have relished putting in his place in the boardroom — now i felt cowed by him			0
' although my success and salary genuinely never caused a problem between us , he ’d had a very traditional upbringing with men being providers and protectors ' when we moved to our current home in 2004 , a converted tile factory with four vast bedrooms and a self - contained annexe — now worth around £ 1 million — several friends commented that ‘ @entity6 ’s obviously doing well ’			0
it was as if i ’d contributed nothing			0
i tried part - time voluntary work , working as a tour guide for an exhibition at @entity239 , and as a magistrate when @entity13 was at school			1
but my agonising insecurity chipped away at our marriage , by now beset with resentments over money and our roles			1
my easy - going husband started to feel the pressure of being the breadwinner , and during our escalating arguments , his ‘ quips ’ about my days , playing tennis and hosting coffee mornings , began to grate			0
i know @entity6 wondered where the joyous woman he married had gone			0
but , as he ’s never had to take a day out of his career when the kids have been ill , or ever known how it feels not to have his own money , how could he understand ? i remind him — usually during a row — that had i still been a lawyer , i ’d be earning around £ 200,000 a year now			1
i know i do this to score points , but i just ca n’t help myself			0
ironically , the only time i have no qualms about spending @entity6 ’s money is after a row , usually in the boutiques in @entity270			1
family life has improved following @entity0 's decision to start up her own website five years ago , we resorted to marriage guidance counselling			1
the counsellor instantly pointed out that i was bored , unstimulated and reliant on @entity6			0
even his insistence that the money is ‘ ours ’ can not shake off the feeling that he is funding my life , which can make me feel little more than a chaffeur or a cleaner			0
he now regrets the fact that we never made plans for me to return to work once both children were at school — for all our sakes			1
so , 18 months ago , i set up a website called totally4women , for women like me			1
this should hopefully save our poor husbands from the brunt of our frustration			0
the website has already broken even and is on the cusp of earning a small income from sponsorship			1
and yes , i ’m smiling more			0
even though my children know i used to have a successful career , i want them to see my work ethic for themselves			0
i regularly implore @entity13 not to completely give up her career if she is one day lucky enough to have children			0
the greatest lesson i have learned is that a happy wife and mum equals a happy household			0
for that reason alone , i wish i ’d found a way to return to work , even part - time			1
i adore my children , and am proud of the childhood i ’ve been able to give them			0
but i miss the old ‘ me ’ every day			0

@entity0 quit her job as a high flying lawyer to be a full time mother
she now regrets her decision and blames it for problems in her marriage
she has since created her own website to help women like herself
