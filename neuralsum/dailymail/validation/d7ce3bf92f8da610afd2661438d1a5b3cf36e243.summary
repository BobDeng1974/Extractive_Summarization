it 's not every day that you find yourself sitting in the front row while a scantily clad dancer writhes in front of you but that is exactly what happened to the @entity8 ' @entity7 last night			1
the 43 - year - old royal did , however , manage to keep a straight face during the modern dance performance which took place at @entity14 's @entity13			1
sat beside @entity18 's @entity17 , who also managed to look suitably interested , the royal was enjoying the second evening of a three - day state visit to @entity18			2
they had flown over especially for the performance which was part of a return banquet hosted by @entity7 and @entity33 for the @entity34			0
designed to highlight @entity8 culture , @entity7 arrived for the event looking wonderful in a patriotic russet gown studded with rhinestones			1
eschewing her usual up - do , the mother - of - three wore her long blonde hair loose and curled for the event , which was designed to give @entity18 and its royals a sneak peek at @entity8 culture			1
sitting on her other side during the performance was @entity33 , who , like 46 - year - old @entity17 , was dapper in a dinner jacket			1
nonplussed : not everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves with some of the audience looking baffled glitzy : all of the royals had dressed up for the occasion , including the sequin - loving @entity53 ( right ) scantily clad : most of the dancers chose to keep clothes to a minimum for the event round of applause : the royals , among them @entity63 , politely clapped when the performance ended well done : the dancers enjoy the adulation at the end of their performance not to be outdone , 43 - year - old crown princess @entity69 opted for a striking strapless black dress with a flattering empire - line cut			1
in contrast to her @entity8 counterpart , the @entity75 - born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye - catching diamond - shaped gold earrings			2
equally glamorous was @entity18 's @entity63 who donned a rose - pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug			0
also at the event was @entity63 's younger son , @entity85 , 45 , and his impeccably dressed @entity87 wife @entity53 , 39 , who swept @entity7 an impressively low curtsey as she arrived			2
glamorous : @entity7 cut a patriotic figure in her dramatic russet gown convivial : @entity33 cracked a joke as he posed with the @entity18 royals outside the venue in charge : @entity18 's @entity63 and the @entity8 ' @entity33 on the red carpet pucker up : @entity7 puckers up as she greets @entity18 's @entity21 outside the event the cultural celebration topped off a busy day for @entity7 and @entity33 who had earlier experienced the best of @entity18 weather during a sunny but blustery ferry crossing to @entity103 island			1
a small speck of land just off @entity18 's @entity106 , the island is entirely carbon - neutral with heat and hot water produced by incinerating hay			0
afterwards , the royal party was shown around a special type of @entity18 boarding school called an efterskole			0
most @entity18 teenagers spend at least a year at the boarding schools , which are usually paid for by parents , albeit helped by a contribution from the state , where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music			0
the efterskole on @entity103 focuses on aquatic sports , diving , aviation and golf , all of which are frequently indulged in by the sports - mad @entity129			0
sweeping a curtsey : @entity87 - born princess @entity53 offers @entity7 a dramatically low curtsey chic : @entity8 @entity33 , @entity18 queen @entity63 , @entity134 and @entity135 stylish : @entity7 is glamorous in russet as she arrives at the @entity13 in @entity14 dressed in their best : @entity18 prime minister @entity139 ( left ) and princess @entity140 @entity33 and @entity7 's trip to @entity103 was one of the main events of their three - day visit , which began with their arrival at @entity148 's royal terminal on tuesday			1
the pair were treated to a banquet at @entity151 that night , with @entity134 wowing in a spectacular royal blue lace dress			0
@entity18 's @entity63 also rose to the occasion in pale blue , while @entity69 chose simple white			0
last night 's cultural event was the last stop on an action - packed itinerary that ends today when the @entity8 royal couple fly home to @entity162			2
70s redux : @entity7 had nailed this season 's 70s trend with her tailored camel coat close : the two couples , who are of a similar age , are known to be close friends hats off to @entity69 and @entity134 ! the @entity8 and @entity18 royals were glamorous in matching trilbies @entity174 hay : @entity69 and @entity7 visit the island 's heating plant , which uses hay to produce hot water			0
