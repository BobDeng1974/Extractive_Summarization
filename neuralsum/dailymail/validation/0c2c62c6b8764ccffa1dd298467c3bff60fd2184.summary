officials in the @entity2 are proposing to pay family doctors £ 150 an hour – as well as £ 200 towards staffing costs – to work for three hours that morning			1
but a number of @entity6 have condemned the size of the payments and say they ’ll only turn up if the money is ' quadrupled '			1
the offer is being made by @entity1 managers in the @entity2 to avert an expected surge in @entity20 attendances over the @entity5 weekend , in early april			1
most gp surgeries will be closed for four days in a row from good friday , 3rd april , through to @entity23 , which is also a bank holiday			0
many patients who fall ill in this time will go to @entity20 as they are still unaware of how to contact their out - of - hours service or of the @entity1 helpline			1
@entity20 units are still under intense pressure even though winter is almost over and the numbers of seriously ill patients has declined			2
figures for last week showed that the @entity1 as a whole failed to meet the target of ensuring that 95 per cent of patients were seen within four hours			2
this has not been met since september but health officials are hoping that the situation will finally improve in april , when the weather turns milder and winter illnesses begin to abate			0
but they are concerned that a sudden surge in demand when gps are closed over @entity5 will cause extra pressures and set hospitals back again			2
@entity1 officials are offering surgeries in the region covering @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 £ 650 to open for three hours			1
this includes £ 150 per hour paid to one gp for three hours and the remaining £ 200 to pay for receptionists or practice nurses			1

' the offer is being made by @entity1 managers in the @entity2 to avert an expected surge in @entity20 attendances over the @entity5 weekend , but many gps have said the offer should be ' quadrupled ' ( file picture ) there are 600 practices in two regions being offered the payments which include the @entity50 , @entity51 and the @entity83 as well as @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
but a number of @entity6 took to the @entity59 website to express their disgust at the size of the payments			2
one wrote : ‘ gps in @entity95 work for such paltry sums it ’s embarrassing			2
’ another said : ‘ now they ’ve established the principle of paying , tell em to quadruple it			0
’ one , a gp partner , a senior doctor in charge of a surgery , said : ‘ i do not get out of bed for less than £ 300 per hour ’ – although it was not clear from his tone whether he was joking			0
and a practice nurse said : ‘ a plumber would get paid more , a solicitor would get that per hour			0
we are seen of no value			0
