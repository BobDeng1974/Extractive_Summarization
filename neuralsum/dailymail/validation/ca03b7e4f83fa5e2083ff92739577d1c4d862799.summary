a new campaign on @entity1 that rallies against the current foodie trend of serving up meals in novelty dishes is gathering momentum			2
steaks laid out on slabs of slate , gooey puddings on planks of wood or even dinner on a gardening spade ... the backlash against domestic items being used as tableware is being spearheaded by @ wewantplates , a @entity1 account that is the brainchild of journalist @entity19			1
in just a week , mr @entity19 , from @entity20 , has already attracted some 5,000 followers with his series of witty ripostes to restaurants who have dared to inject a large portion of gimmick into their presentation of meals			1
' it was captioned , without irony , " that is a big meal ! " ' it was n't a big meal - he 'd fallen for all this style - over - content nonsense			0
i searched @entity1 for an account which would allow me to vent my spleen with like - minded people , but found nothing			1
' we want plates was born , and has already topped 5,000 followers			0
' diners rankled by the imagination of the restaurants they 've eaten in have been quick to send in shots of their own experiences , with bread and butter served in a flat cap , afternoon tea perfectly placed on a mini garden bench and a communal portion of spaghetti served straight on to the table top			2
started just a week ago , the @entity1 account , run by @entity19 from @entity20 , has already attracted plenty of attention from disgruntled diners calling for a return to simple plates mamma mia ! this @entity97 restaurant takes the words communal and table to the limit , with diners invited to tuck into a sharing portion of spaghetti and sauce on the bare surface a crate idea ? tartare sauce in a tiny watering can , peas in a plant pot and fish and chips in a wooden box and ( right ) a delicate starter is served atop a piece of stone no it is n't bedtime , yes , this is part of your dining experience			1
a surprised diner tucks into ' a yoghurt ice cream " brush " , mint - eucalyptus crème " paste " and a gin and tonic ' at a restaurant in @entity129 he adds : ' i ’m certainly not looking to challenge any small businesses by ‘ outing ’ them for their chopping boards or mini shopping trolleys of chips			0
the only ones that i ’ve named directly , or retweeted , are the bigger chains			0
i ’m sure they can rise above it			0
' one chef willing to put his head above the parapet , @entity145 who runs the @entity147 at @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity150 , said that diners would miss the inventive ideas if chefs returned to more simple tableware			2
' why do people want different clothing or cars ? why not all drive around in the same one ! after all , they all do the same job do n't they ? food is about the whole experience , we all like individuality and chefs are no different			2
' so how does mr @entity19 actually think restaurants should present their food ? with little fuss , it seems			1
' simple white plates and a well - pressed , clean table cloth			0
is that too much to ask ?			0
' food can look great in mason jars ( but is a pain in the @ rse to eat ) says @entity19 tea time with a difference : this deconstructed brew was served with milk in test tubes cheesy feet anyone ? @entity185 balls served in sudded @entity187 shoes might be one step too far looks sharp ! butter slivers served on a broken bathroom tile wo n't wash with @entity191 cosy crusts : @entity193 likes to serve bread slippers in restaurants the chopping board where it all began : not a terribly big meal , just a ' normal - sized meal inexplicably served on a large piece of wood , ' tweeted @entity19 @entity202 and always yum : the @entity204 in @entity205 's @entity203 serves mushroom croquettes on bark			1

@ wewantplates is a @entity1 account which pokes *fun* at the weird and *wonderful* way in which restaurants present their food to diners
account was set up by @entity19 , *40* , from @entity20 after a friend posted a photo of a steak on a slate online
nearly 5,000 people from across the globe have followed the account
chef *defends* the use of quirky presentation , saying ' we all like individuality and chefs are no different
