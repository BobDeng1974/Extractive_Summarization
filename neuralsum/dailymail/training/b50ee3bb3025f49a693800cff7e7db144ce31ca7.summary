by @entity0 , @entity1 editor lives could be put at risk due to cuts in food safety inspections and testing , according to the expert leading the horsemeat scandal inquiry			1
hundreds of trading standards are being lost as part of local council cuts , while public analyst laboratories , which conduct food safety tests , are being shut down			1
the cuts come at a time when food fraud , as demonstrated by the horsemeat scandal , is a rising and posing a threat to the health of consumers			1
food hygiene lab tests such as this could be axed as a result of council cuts to trading standards departments , according to food hygiene expert , professor @entity27 ( file image ) trading standards officers are involved in policing the cleanliness of food outlets and takeaways as well as ensuring food is what it claims to be on a label or menu			1
it is claimed that cuts in some @entity41 boroughs mean that just one trading standards officer is responsible for monitoring thousands of food businesses			2
the government appointed professor @entity27 , who heads the @entity45 , in @entity46 , to lead the independent review into last year ’s scandal where horsemeat was passed off as beef in burgers and ready meals			1
he is concerned about anticipated cuts of 40per cent to the @entity55 @entity54 , which could mean the number of officers falls from a high of 3,000 in 2009 to around 1,900 by 2015			1
prof @entity27 said : ‘ what we have to be careful of is that the budget cutting gets to a point where the integrity of our supply chains , the safety of the food that people eat , gets compromised to such a point that people start to die			2
‘ i certainly hope that it does n’t happen and all the indications are at the minute that the food industry is stepping up to the mark			0
‘ they ’re doing more checking and testing ; but the food industry ca n’t do it on their own			0
what we need are strong regulators and well - resourced regulators			0
’ prof @entity27 says the @entity81 should be given new powers to tackle fraud in the food industry his concerns echo those of @entity87 , from the @entity88 , who said : ‘ you take money out of sampling , you take money out of inspection , you take money out of the consumer protection system			1
' you will get increased levels of fraudulent activity and you make the consumer protection regime that ’s designed to deal with it much more impotent – and that ’s a big concern			2
‘ when you have some authorities – like some in @entity41 – operating on one trading standards officer , how on earth can they possibly deal with all their demands , from fraudulent activity ? ’ prof @entity27 has recommended that the @entity81 be given new powers to tackle fraud through a @entity107			2
speaking on the release of his interim review in december , he said : ‘ the @entity55 food industry is currently too vulnerable to criminals wishing to perpetrate fraud			2
the professor was appointed to lead a review into food safety after the horsemeat scandal ( file image ) ‘ not enough evidence is collected about food crime and we do n’t yet know the extent of how this global problem affects the @entity55 food and drink market , worth £ 188billion			1
‘ estimates of the level of criminality vary , so further investigation needs to be a priority			0
‘ we need a culture within businesses involved in supplying food that focusses on depriving those who seek to deceive consumers			0
‘ government , and in particular a more robust @entity81 has a major role to play partnering these efforts			0
’ the gaps in consumer protection will be highlighted in a @entity141 dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight			1
' we have to be careful of budget cutting getting to a point where the safety of the food that people eat gets compromised to a point where people start to die ' professor @entity27 , food safety expert the @entity81 ’s chief operating officer , @entity150 , tells the programme that prof @entity27 makes a valid point			1
‘ he is right to be concerned about the level of trading standards officers keeping food safe			1
there has been a reduction in the number of officers			0
there has been a reduction in the amount of sampling , ’ he said			0
however , mr @entity150 said a ‘ very strong ’ network of food safety checks does still exist			2
‘ it ’s increasingly risk - based , it is being helped by better intelligence and that will be one of the keys to unlocking some of the issues that we face , ’ he said			0
the food and farming department @entity176 , insisted @entity55 ’s food is safe			0
a spokesman said : ‘ professor @entity27 ’s interim review recognises that @entity55 consumers have access to some of the safest food in the world we want to keep it that way			1
‘ in the last year , we have taken action to prevent food crime , including increasing unannounced inspections of meat cutting plants and boosting funding to £ 2 million to support local authorities ’ food sampling programme			0
