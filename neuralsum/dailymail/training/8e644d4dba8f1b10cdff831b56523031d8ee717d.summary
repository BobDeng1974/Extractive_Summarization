after police were alerted to the scene , a grid search was conducted while the hair was taken into evidence			0

' @entity3 was last seen beginning a short walk from her home to @entity286 on the morning of october 5			1
a search by hundreds of law officers did not start until hours later because @entity3 's mother works nights and slept through a call from school officials saying @entity3 was n't there			1
