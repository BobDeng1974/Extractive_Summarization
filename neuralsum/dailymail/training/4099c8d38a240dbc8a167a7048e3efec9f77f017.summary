a teacher has been instructed by her school to lose her northern accent and sound ‘ more southern ’			1
the woman , who works at a secondary school in @entity5 , was told to focus on ‘ sounding less @entity6 ’ as one of her official performance targets by her bosses			1
the order apparently came after an @entity12 inspector made a comment about her accent			2
' bizarre ' : the woman , who works at an unidentified secondary school in @entity17 , has been told ' sounding less @entity6 ' is now one of her official targets , after a comment made by an @entity12 inspector ( file picture ) it is unclear whether the comment was simply an off - the - cuff remark or an official observation			1
in any case , the school appears to have acted on it			2
but it has been described as the ‘ most extreme and bizarre objective ’ ever heard of by the teachers ’ union , which said it was also an ‘ extreme form of discrimination and bullying ’			1
the teacher herself did not make an official complaint to the @entity38 but raised the issue when discussing the targets set by her school			2
@entity42 , @entity38 ’s national executive member for the @entity5 area , said : ‘ apparently the beginning of this was @entity12 , who made a comment about her accent			0
' victimisation ' : the order by school bosses to take the comment seriously has been confirmed by a teaching union , which described it as the ' most extreme and bizarre objective ' it had ever heard ( file picture ) ' as a consequence of that comment being made , it was decided that it would be a reasonable objective to impose upon the member			1
‘ she was told she needed to make her northern @entity6 accent sound more southern			0
we are very disturbed by this issue – it is victimisation			0
’ mr @entity42 said union officials would be arranging talks with the local education authority			0
he refused to identify the school , except to say it has a number of issues which the union is challenging , including its potential transformation into an academy			1
an @entity12 spokesman said that it was not aware of the comments made by an inspector and would investigate if the union provided the name of the school			1
he added : ‘ inspectors comment on the standard of teaching at schools			0
' @entity92 comments about the suitability of regional accents are clearly inappropriate , and should form no part of our assessment of a school ’s or teacher ’s performance			0
’ note : @entity12 contacted @entity102 on november 20 to say the school in question had ' confirmed that there was never any mention of regional accents by the inspectors '			0
this new information was put to @entity38 , where a spokesman said the union would not be commenting further .			0
