created : 04:08 est , 19 march 2014 a @entity1 college was forced to drop plans for a @entity4 - themed ball after concerns were raised over racism by a student			2
@entity8 had planned to theme its annual summer ball around the contemporary southern @entity11			1
however , organisers decided to abandon their original plans , and instead re-brand the event the journey through @entity16			1
diverse : founded in 1896 , @entity18 's prides itself as being one of the most diverse colleges at the @entity1 founded in 1896 , @entity18 's prides itself as being one of the most diverse colleges at the @entity1 , with students coming from over fifty different countries			0
@entity18 's student @entity25 , who was born in @entity26 , initially claimed to @entity27 that the ball was to be themed around the @entity30 winning novel , ' @entity31 , saying : ' it is a film that glamourises the romantic dreams of a slave owner and a @entity36 member while rendering the horrors of slavery invisible			1
' ' the black characters fulfil every derogatory racist stereotype of the " slave " and black people continue to be subject to the modern - day versions of these stereotypes			0
' in fact , ' @entity31 ' was just one of several literary works briefly considered at a closed meeting of the organising committee as a means of making the contemporary @entity11 south theme more ' eye catching '			1
organisers unanimously selected ' @entity4 ' ( the band of that name had been contacted to play at the ball ) , believing literary works to be too contentious			1
miss @entity25 was not a member of the ball committee			1
the decision to change the theme of the annual @entity62 from ' @entity4 ' to ' @entity63 ' was made by organisers last month			1
a website advertising the ball states : ' we are pleased to announce the theme for @entity69 is " @entity63 "			1
' experience all four seasons in one memorable night ; our college grounds will evoke fruitful autumn gardens , long midwinter nights , the early hours of spring and the fierce passion of midsummer			0
' expect scorching heat and wild storms throughout this explosive @entity62			2
' last year the event was themed around the 1920s set @entity80 novel @entity79			2
a @entity8 spokesman said : ' the college felt that it would have only been necessary for it to intervene formally if the matter had not been resolved satisfactorily			2
' the college supports the change of theme and is proud of its record of friendliness and cordiality			2
' a @entity1 spokesman said that the issue was a ' college matter ' , and he was unable to comment			0
last week members of @entity1 's @entity93 ran the ' i , @entity95 , @entity96 , campaign calling on students to speak out about racial discrimination on campus			0
during the campaign committee members invited students to be photographed holding up a whiteboard proclaiming a message about their experiences as a means to raise awareness of the issues facing ethnic minority students			0
the campaign also aims to promote engagement with the @entity93 issues amongst the student body			0
vice president stressed that students need not self identify as belonging to an ethnic minority in order to engage with the @entity93 campaign			0
' i want students to feel interested in what we have to say , and even though it does not affect them directly understand that it affects their friends or people they know , ' @entity93 vice president @entity119 told @entity127 .			0
