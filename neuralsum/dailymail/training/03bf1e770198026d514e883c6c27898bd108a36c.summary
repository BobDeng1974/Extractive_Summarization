by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 09:38 est , 25 january 2013 noble philosophy : @entity2 now lives for the moment were it not for an apparently trivial series of events , @entity7 , his wife @entity5 and baby daughter @entity4 would have perished in the bushfire that destroyed their @entity13 home			1
it is four years since that traumatic day in february 2009 but this is the first time @entity7 , one of @entity18 ’s most popular stand - up comedians , has felt able to talk about it at length			1
it has changed his outlook on life , and resulted in the family uprooting from their 100 - acre farm just outside @entity27 and settling back in @entity18 , where he was born			1
‘ normally , at that time of year , i would have been touring @entity13 and we would most likely have been in the house together just before the tour started , ’ he says			1
‘ for various reasons , i ’d decided to do a @entity33 tour instead and was preparing with some warm - up gigs in @entity13			1
‘ on the day of the fire , @entity5 was due to come to meet me after a gig so we could spend some time on our own while her parents looked after @entity4 at our house			1
‘ the day before , she took our two dogs to stay with some friends			1
when she got back , it was so hot in the house that , instead of waiting for her parents to come to us , she decided to drive over to them , about 45 minutes away , and return later when it was cooler			1
‘ once there , her mum said : “ why do n’t you just stay here tonight ? @entity2 is away , and the dogs are n’t in the house			1
i ’ll cook the tea , the baby is asleep , and we can head back to the house with @entity4 tomorrow			1
” ‘ she agreed to stay , but first she wanted to go home to pick up some things			1
however , when she turned into our road a fire truck ordered her to turn around			1
she drove back down the road as fast as she could , with flames chasing her			1
‘ if she ’d got there ten minutes earlier she would have been in the house when the flames came through			2
or if she had n’t decided to go to her parents , she would have still been in the house			2
’ as he says this , the sense of narrowly avoided loss is still palpable			2
@entity7 , now 36 , had converted his cellar into a vault housing a 2,500 dvd and vintage vinyl record collection , rare comedy memorabilia and collectable toys			2
he lost it all , as well as his beloved classic motorbikes			1
all he had left was an overnight bag and a change of clothing for his tour			2
after a few weeks sorting things out in @entity13 , and feeling the urge to cling together , @entity5 and @entity4 accompanied him on his @entity18 tour			1
@entity5 is @entity13 , but @entity2 comes from @entity83			1
‘ we ’d be in a different hotel every night , with a four - month - old baby and our three bags — which was all we possessed			1
‘ but at least we had somewhere			2
some people had lost everything and were living in tents			1
@entity2 leaves @entity92 : @entity7 and his family left their 100 - acre farm in @entity13 after it got destroyed in a bushfire and moved @entity18 ‘ me and @entity5 were messed up by it all			1
i talk in my sleep and sleep walk with my eyes wide open at the best of times			2
@entity5 was suffering from post-traumatic stress and having horrendous nightmares			2
@entity4 was waking up — because that ’s what babies do			2
‘ i had these nightmares where i ’d wake up and think they were dead , and i ’d have to check the bed and cot to make sure they were n’t			2
then i ’d be able to go back to sleep			1
‘ i had to do a gig in @entity113 and the thought of dragging them up there from @entity117 was just too much , so i went on my own			2
i woke up in @entity113 to find i had trashed the hotel room			2
i had obviously freaked out , gone round the place going mad looking for @entity5 and @entity4 , and then gone back to sleep			1
‘ doing the comedy shows helped , because a show is all about being in that moment			2
it stopped me dwelling on what had happened			2
’ they set about trying to rebuild their lives , and six months later were sitting in an empty house outside @entity27 awaiting delivery of their new furniture			2
‘ it might seem like a weird thing to say , but we felt very lucky , ’ says @entity7			2
‘ yes we lost our house , we lost our lifestyle , all our stuff , but none of us died or was burned			1
‘ considering what happened to a lot of people , we got off lightly			0
we lost 15 friends and neighbours in our street that day			1
’ in the remote area where @entity7 lived — which he calls ‘ @entity147 ’ — the locals were well - drilled in fire precautions			0
‘ there were a lot of people we knew who died who were as prepared as you could possibly be			0
but if a fire of that size comes through , you do n’t stand a chance			0
there is nothing you can do to survive			0
’ when things settled , they considered moving north to @entity161 , but when there was torrential flooding there , @entity5 said she wanted to move to the @entity166 countryside			0
‘ i loved the @entity13 bush but it ’s a harsh place to live , especially with a young family [ their second baby is due any moment ]			1
when children are playing outside , you have constantly to be on the lookout for poisonous snakes and spiders			0
we wanted to live that life , but we did n’t want such risks			0
’ the loss of all his possessions made him more philosophical , too			0
‘ it ’s not that you appreciate what you ’ve got more , but you realise it could end in an instant			0
it makes you enjoy the moment a lot more			0
the main thing i learned when you lose everything is that you are the curator of a collection that no one cares about			0
you think it ’s an important collection , but if you died it would end up in a charity shop			0
scream with laughter : @entity7 as stitches the clown in horror comedy with the same name ‘ i ’ve got very few things now , and everything i do own feels like there ’s no history to it			0
i try to buy old things with some kind of story			0
‘ just after the fire , i was left with just the one pair of sandals			0
the @entity212 set up a stall to help people out locally			0
hundreds of new boots were donated , and someone had put their old fire - fighting boots amongst them			0
‘ they were knackered , but i thought “ i ’ll have them			0
” they had a big hole in them , but they ’re probably my favourite shoes because they have a history			0
’ this eccentric side of @entity7 has been an integral part of his success as a comedian			1
he was no less eccentric as an 11 - year - old child , riding the ten miles from @entity234 to his school in @entity236 on a unicycle and carrying his books in a pizza box			1
‘ i used to shave my head , leaving a long fringe which i dyed blond			0
‘ one of my school reports — i wish i still had it — said : “ his eccentric classroom behaviour will be a real handicap for him in the future			0
” really ? ’ he laughs at the memory			0
of course , it ’s been the making of him and his fortune			0
‘ as soon as i said i want to be a comedian , my mum and dad said , “ well , that ’s a natural progression			1
” most parents would probably say , “ oh , he ’s going to be destitute ” , but they just went : “ brilliant ! ”			0
‘ there are people who say “ oh , you need something to fall back on ”			1
i just think that ’s the very thing you do n’t need , because you will fall back on it			1
i started stand - up when i was 15 , then at 18 i moved to @entity117			1
cracking the @entity117 circuit was almost like starting again			0
’ but crack it he did , and by 1999 he was nominated for a @entity270 at the @entity271 , he has now become a tv comedy fixture , and toured the @entity18 every year — only taking a year off last year to settle into the family ’s new home near @entity275 , @entity276			1
he ’s back in @entity13 for a tour in march , and at the same time the comedy horror movie he made last year , stitches , is released on @entity280 in the @entity18			1
the film won the @entity282 at 2012 ’s @entity283			0
his stage shows are famously unscripted			0
surely it ’s terrifying to stand on stage and not know exactly what you are going to say ? ‘ you know what is scary to me ? getting up in the morning and working in a factory			0
or if someone said to me : “ oh , you are in charge of running a children ’s home			0
” that would really terrify me			0
’ @entity7 ’s dvd @entity298 is out now			0
stitches is out on dvd and @entity301 on march 4 .			0

@entity303 lost everything in 2009 bushfire which destroyed their @entity13 farm
@entity236 comedian took wife and baby daughter and moved back to @entity18
