there were three main incidents at @entity2 on tuesday night - one given as a penalty , and the other two waved away			1
@entity4 came from behind to rescue a deserved draw against @entity6 in the @entity8 semi-final first leg , leaving an important clash at @entity10 to decide the tie			0
here , @entity13 's @entity12 mulls over the three main refereeing calls from the match			0
@entity16 appeared to handle the ball outside his 18 - yard area but was not penalised for it @entity20 was correct to give @entity16 the benefit of the doubt as he could not get his hands away the @entity24 screamed for handball as @entity16 slid out of his penalty area but referee @entity20 , perhaps unsighted waved appeals away			1
when a keeper leaves his area you treat him as an outfield player and as his weight was on his arms again he could n’t get his arm away and the ball hit him			0
@entity37 ( left ) , can and @entity36 appeal loudly after @entity38 appeared to handle the ball in his area @entity38 - lying on the ground - seemed to drag the ball back , but @entity20 got it right again as it was n't deliberate consistency again from @entity20 as he viewed @entity38 the same way			1
@entity38 was on the floor inside his own penalty area when the ball hit his arm			2
with his weight on his arm he could n’t move it and @entity20 was right not to give a penalty as it must be a deliberate offence			2
@entity51 might want to reflect on refereeing consistency as @entity53 saw a similar incident the same way when @entity6 lost at @entity55			0
@entity20 was also perfectly placed with a clear view to point to the penalty mark when @entity58 tripped @entity59			1
it was a clumsy , late challenge and a clear foul			0
@entity20 was perfectly placed for the penalty incident and got it correct again by giving a spot kick			2

there were three main incidents for @entity20 to deal with
@entity58 tripped @entity59 and it was correctly given as a penalty
@entity38 appeared to handle in the area but it was not deliberate
@entity20 was also correct to give @entity16 the benefit of the doubt
