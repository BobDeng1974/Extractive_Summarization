once nicknamed the ‘ slave bracelet ’ , its design is rumoured to have been based on the medieval chastity belt into which men would lock their wives when they went to war			0
yet this has done nothing to stop the rise of the bangle that has become the latest must - have trinket for a new generation of celebrities			1
the @entity14 bracelet has graced the wrists of @entity17 actresses @entity18 and @entity19 , while last week @entity20 was spotted in @entity14 ’s @entity22 store getting her 18 - carat gold bangle replaced			1
the upmarket jeweller , a favourite of the @entity34 , launched its @entity36 bangles in 1969			1
the bracelet was designed to be given to one ’s true love and then screwed on to their wrist for all eternity			1
it consists of two c - shaped halves which are then secured using two working screws on either side			1
it is understood that 31 - year - old @entity20 , who is in a relationship with financier @entity47 , had lost or misplaced her original bangle when the screws came loose			1
a replacement screw costs as much as £ 245 , while the bracelets themselves range from £ 4,450 to an eye - watering £ 39,900 for bespoke designs inlaid with diamonds – making them a powerful status symbol on a par with a @entity60 watch			1
it is understood @entity20 was so upset by the loss of her bracelet , she went straight to the brand ’s @entity22 store to buy another one			1
according to a source , her replacement was a gift from the company			0
@entity18 , left , and @entity19 , right , are all fans of the bracelet , which ranges from £ 4,000 to £ 40,000 @entity75 was lucky too when her @entity36 bracelet – given to her by her late husband @entity77 – was one of the pieces burglars left behind when they raided her home			1
@entity81 bought an 18 - carat gold @entity82 as a ‘ push present ’ for his then wife @entity19 on the birth of their daughter @entity86 in 2006			2
meanwhile , actress @entity88 , who was then the face of @entity90 , was presented with one of the bracelets by the firm ’s boss @entity93 as a token of his affection			0
the bracelet , which this year celebrates its 45th birthday , was created by @entity14 ’s @entity100 designer @entity99			2
he started working there in 1969 , producing his iconic @entity36 bracelet the same year			1
@entity99 had been fascinated by history and often produced work around legends and old practices			0
he was particularly interested in the story of men locking up their wives with iron chastity belts to ensure their fidelity while they were away on the battlefield			0
the designer is thought to have adopted the idea of being locked in a committed relationship in his @entity36 bracelet design			2
in an interview at the time , @entity99 said : ‘ @entity36 has become too commercial , yet life without love is nothing – a fat zero			2
what modern people want are love symbols that look semi-permanent – or , at least , require a trick to remove			0
after all , love symbols should suggest an everlasting quality			0
’ when the bracelets were launched , @entity14 enforced a rule that customers were not allowed to buy one for themselves			1
they could only make a purchase for somebody else – however , that is a rule that has since been abolished			0
@entity14 presented the bangles to 25 well - known couples including , rather ironically , @entity135 and @entity136 , at a ceremony in its boutique in @entity139			1
@entity20 , left , was spotted getting her bracelet fixed last week and @entity29 , right , has no fewer than six each couple locked each other in before exchanging screwdrivers			1
to ensure that they were authentic to the last , @entity14 last year lent the @entity144 a pink - gold love bracelet , set with four diamonds , for its 2013 film @entity148 starring @entity149 and @entity150			1
soon @entity14 found it could not keep up with production			2
love bracelets were spotted on the wrists of @entity155 and @entity156 and later @entity157 , princess @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and more recently @entity161 , @entity162 and model @entity163			2
the @entity166 bracelet with diamonds was launched in 1979 followed by the @entity36 ring , @entity36 cufflinks and @entity166 earrings			1
at one point the bracelet was so well known that it became a measure of one ’s commitment			0
asking one ’s beau if he loved you enough to buy the @entity14 bracelet was on a par with an engagement			2
@entity14 currently lists 16 lockable bracelets on its website			2
its classic design comes in yellow , pink or white gold , while more intricate designs feature yellow and pink sapphires , garnets and amethysts			0
the bracelets have appeared on the lists of top auction houses include @entity194 ’s and @entity195			0
in 1998 , two gold @entity14 bracelets belonging to the @entity197 and @entity198 were among the items in the 1998 @entity201 ’s auction of the @entity202 ’ private collections			2
the auction famously made more than three times the estimated value			0
not that the bracelets are always for eternity			0
@entity208 returned two diamond - encrusted @entity36 bracelets she had bought for her then boyfriend @entity211 when he cheated on her in 2012			1
mr @entity211 had claimed a tape showing him in bed with another woman had been made before he met the daughter of @entity217 billionaire , @entity216			0
but sources close to miss @entity208 believed she had ‘ absolute proof ’ this was not the case after spotting mr @entity211 wearing the two bracelets in the film			0
others who are having second thoughts about being shackled to another need n’t worry			0
the bracelet can be removed using a special mini screwdriver which handily comes with every purchase .			0
