@entity0 could be linked to the city 's @entity2 water network to heat the vast medieval church using ancient underground springs			1
the idea has been in the pipeline for years , but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it ’s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring			2
the @entity12 ’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of @entity15 ’s 45 ° c spring water to power a modern heating system for the building			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) could have the world 's first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in @entity2 drains			1
the idea has been in the pipeline for years , but now excavation work has begun to determine whether it ’s possible to connect a modern heating system with an ancient hot spring the @entity27 , which lies at the heart of @entity30 's only @entity29 , was granted planning permission for the unique £ 18million scheme two years ago			2
engineers plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a @entity2 drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground			1
they hope to divert the warm water instead through a network of underground pipes to provide a world - first natural underfloor heating system for the abbey			2
church leaders believe the plans would provide a unique source of green energy for the abbey and help the 10th century building reconnect with the city 's @entity2 roots			0
plans show how @entity0 will use water from the city 's ancient springs , which heat water used in its @entity58			1
waste water currently filters out to the @entity60 but could be put to use under the new scheme an artist 's impression of plans for @entity0 shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system , new work space and song school today , excavation work is taking place on @entity71 outside the @entity72 to determine the feasibility of installing the system			1
each day , a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the @entity15 from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site			1
a large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby @entity60 – passing through the @entity81			2
the idea is , that it this waste water was harnessed correctly and converted , it could produce 1.5 megawatts of continuous energy – enough to heat @entity0 and the world - famous @entity15 and @entity88 complex			1
engineers are currently digging 13 ft ( 4 metres ) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger , which transfers heat from one medium to another			0
a spokesman for the project told @entity100 that the investigations are in their infancy , but it appears that water levels may be too low to use in the @entity105 area , but that energy could be harnessed in the @entity108 part of the drain			0
a small scale trial is also underway to test how the heat can warm up different types of stone floors in the buildings			0
the @entity12 ’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of @entity15 ’s 45 ° c spring water to power a modern heating system for the building			1
the idea is that waste water from the baths escaping down the @entity81 would enter a hidden thermal heat exchange and heat the @entity0 ( illustrated above ) engineers plan to tap the power of warm waste water from the @entity2 bathing complex ( pictured )			1
engineers are currently digging 13 ft ( 4 metres ) below the ground to work out what lies in the space and if it could be suitable to house a thermal heat exchanger the plans for @entity0 's underfloor heating may use modern technologies , but will make use of the same natural spring tapped by the @entity139			1
the @entity139 came up with underfloor heating called a hypocaust , which heated houses and public spaces with hot air			0
the word comes from the @entity146 , where hypo means under and caust means burnt			0
@entity139 used underfloor heating , or hypocausts to heat rooms at @entity15 's intricate bathing complex			2
here , you can see the pilae stacks though which hot air would have circulated to heat a tile floor on top the floor was raised above the ground by pillars called pilae stacks and made of a layers of tiles sandwiched together with concrete			0
the air under the floor was heated by a furnace			0
walls were also made of hollow bricks so hot air could circulate through them , as well as below the tiles			0
rooms requiring the most heat were placed closest to the furnace , the heat of which could be adjusted by adding more wood to the fire			0
it was labour intensive to sun a hypocaust as the fire needed a lot of fuel and constant attention , meaning underfloor heating was used in large public buildings , luxurious villas and bath complexes			0
every day , a quarter of a million gallons of hot water flow through the @entity15 from the thermal spring located at the heart of the site			2
a large quantity of this hot water eventually ends up in the nearby @entity60 ( pictured ) – passing through the @entity81 the modern elements of the system would be hidden underground and an archaeologist will be working alongside the engineers to document any objects that may be uncovered by the excavation			1
once the investigation is complete , the ground will be covered back up and the engineers will work out how the thermal heat exchanger will be housed			0
@entity206 , @entity207 from @entity0 , said : ‘ an innovative thermal heating scheme using @entity15 ’s hot springs ticks all the right boxes , while providing a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for both the @entity0 and the @entity213 complex			0
’ two years ago , @entity0 rector @entity214 said : ‘ these are ambitious plans which would allow us to capture an incredible and ancient natural resource which is currently being wasted			0
‘ @entity27 lies at the heart of what was once @entity15 , and our architects have located a drain where spring water flows			1
‘ as it stands , the water pours away and empties eventually into the @entity60			2
‘ our plan is to remove the floor of the @entity0 , dig down and divert the drain and then pump the water through an underground heating system to warm the church			1
‘ it would provide virtually all of the @entity0 's heating and would give us a unique way to reduce our carbon footprint			0
' today , excavation work is taking place on @entity71 outside the @entity72 to determine the feasibility of installing the system a new work space could be created beneath the ground under the plans to excavate parts of @entity0 some 850,000 litres of spring water which usually filters through to the @entity60 will be used to heat the @entity0			1
an illustration of the city from above is shown			0

@entity139 drains with warm spring water could be used for *eco-heating*
850,000 litres of waste spring water filters to @entity60 each day at present
this waste water could be used to heat @entity0 in the *historic* city
engineers are looking at drains to *explore* whether the idea is *viable*
