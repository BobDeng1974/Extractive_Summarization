by @entity0 published : 18:26 est , 6 may 2012 updated : 08:27 est , 7 may 2012 the safety of one of the most popular forms of @entity4 has been called into question after a study showed it doubled the risk of birth defects			1
researchers found that one in ten babies born through @entity11 suffered some form of abnormality			1
this compares with just over one in 20 of those conceived naturally			2
but what experts do n’t know yet is whether the problems are caused by the treatment , or the fact couples having it are at higher risk of defects anyway			1
crucial moment : a single sperm is injected directly into an egg in @entity11 treatment @entity11 – or intracytoplasmic sperm injection – is used to treat male infertility			2
it involves injecting a sperm directly into an egg with a fine glass needle			2
more than 23,000 procedures were performed last year and it represents just over half of all @entity4 treatments it can help couples who were previously unable to conceive because the man ’s sperm count was low or they were of too poor quality to swim up to the egg			1
in this latest study , published in the @entity48 , researchers from the @entity45 in @entity46 looked at more than 300,000 births			2
they found that babies born via @entity11 were 57 per cent more likely to suffer some form of abnormality			1
questions and answers on @entity4 these ranged from serious defects of the heart and digestive system to relatively minor abnormalities such as club feet that could be fixed with surgery			1
overall 9.9 per cent of babies born through @entity11 had a defect compared with 5.8 per cent of those born naturally			1
by contrast , standard ivf – where semen containing thousands of sperm is placed in a dish with eggs – was found to be no more risky than natural conception , once the couple ’s age and other factors had been accounted for			2
experts are unsure whether it is the treatment causing the defects or the poor quality sperm of the men			0
lead author professor @entity78 , from the @entity45 , said : ‘ we know from the study that standard @entity4 is safe			1
but we also now know that with @entity11 , the risk is sky high			0
’ he pointed out that the technique involved implanting faulty sperm into an egg – in nature these would be weeded out			0
dr @entity87 , fertility expert at the @entity88 and chairman of the @entity90 , said : ‘ an important point to make is that we know that babies conceived naturally to couples previously diagnosed with infertility are also at slightly higher risk , which suggests that it may be something to do with the “ infertility ” rather than the “ technology ” used to conceive them			1
‘ it should be stressed that the vast majority of babies born are healthy and the actual risks of any problems being detected are small			1
’ and professor @entity105 , of the @entity106 , said : ‘ it may well be that the sort of families who have to use @entity11 have extreme sperm damage , and this may be the explanation as to why there is a higher rate of congenital abnormalities			1
’ only two years ago the inventor of @entity11 , @entity117 , warned it was being overused			0
professor @entity117 – who invented it in @entity119 in 1991 – told a conference that it should only be used as a last resort as it may cause problems in children			0
since the news of this study broke a number of women have contacted the @entity128 to say they have used the technique and had perfectly healthy babies			1
campaigners urged couples to speak to their doctors if they were concerned			1
@entity134 , of leading patient charity , @entity136 , said : ‘ @entity4 and @entity11 bring joy to tens of thousands of people every year – last year there were around 60,000 cycles of @entity4 in the @entity141 and without this many couples would never experience the joy of having a child of their own			1
‘ if patients are concerned by this research , i would recommend they speak directly to their clinician who will be able to discuss their individual situation			0
’ case study @entity151 and @entity152 used @entity11 to have their daughter @entity153 after spending four years trying to conceive naturally			0
mrs @entity155 , 27 , had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome , which can lead to problems in becoming pregnant			0
her 26 - year - old husband had arthritis and his treatment could have affected his own fertility			1
after one round of @entity4 failed , the couple , from @entity163 , @entity164 , were offered @entity11 by the @entity166 in @entity167			1
research plea : @entity152 and @entity155 with daughter @entity153 as a baby @entity153 , now three , developed a brain cyst and kidney problems and was born at only 26 weeks			2
mrs @entity155 , who looks after @entity153 full - time , said : ‘ when @entity153 was in the neonatal intensive care ward , i would say about 80 per cent of the other babies there had been conceived using fertility treatment			2
‘ at least two were definitely from @entity11			0
there may well be something in that			0
‘ i obviously do n’t know whether @entity153 ’s problems are related to @entity11			0
but i would have been happier if someone had spelled out the risks			0
i do n’t remember that happening at the time			0
‘ when you ’re so desperate to have a family , as we were , someone could tell you it would be born with three heads and you would n’t care			2
‘ if someone said , “ there is a low risk your child could be disabled ” , i ’d see that as a high chance the baby would be fine			0
‘ having said that , i would 100 per cent back any move to issue parents doing this with more warnings about what the problems could be to avoid the shock we had			0
‘ there needs to be so much more research			0

survey shows injections used by *20,000* @entity141 couples a year reveals one in ten babies born with abnormalities
findings show all other @entity4 procedures are safe
clinics *accused* of *profiting* from more *expensive* procedure
