on june 24 in @entity1 , @entity0 contributed the single most memorable act of this summer ’s @entity3 when he bit @entity5 defender @entity4			1
it set off a chain of events that ultimately saw the @entity8 sold to @entity9 by coincidence , also playing that day was the man who has now transpired to be @entity0 ’s unlikely replacement at @entity13 and it is the evidence of that hot afternoon in north - east @entity16 that , as much as anything , goes to show just how big a gamble @entity19 is taking in bringing @entity20 back to the @entity21			1
fouled early on , he contributed almost nothing , was booked for dissent and substituted at half - time			2
in some ways , @entity20 ’s @entity3 mirrored his career			1
he scored against @entity48 in the first game to briefly threaten a genuine impact			2
two totally ineffective games later , he was heading home			0
this is what should perhaps give @entity13 supporters pause for thought today			2
@entity20 ’s colourful private life may well be manageable by someone like @entity19			1
what is open to question , though , is whether the 24 - year - old has improved enough as a footballer since he left @entity62 one - and - a - half years ago to merit an investment of £ 16millon plus wages			1
on the surface the evidence would appear not			0
@entity20 was a million miles away from being a @entity21 footballer during his time at @entity62			1
even @entity70 ’s own coaching staff felt that			2
a dreadful trainer with an inability — or unwillingness — to listen and to process information , he could rarely be relied upon in game situations largely because of his tendency to disregard instructions and therefore disrupt team shape and tactics			0
on the training pitch , @entity20 used to antagonise team - mates when he grew restless and feign injury whenever he made a mistake			2
it was not a particularly effective combination			0
on the field , he provided occasional moments of inspiration but they were relatively rare			0
striker : @entity20 scored 30 goals in 80 games for @entity62 before moving back to @entity42 flashpoint : @entity20 had a number of run - ins during his explosive relationship with @entity70 difficult footballers — @entity0 , for example — are often worth the trouble if they contribute on the field			1
if they do n’t then they just become an expensive waste of time			0
having returned to @entity42 , @entity20 scored 14 @entity105 goals last season , a decent return in that competition			1
it is tempting to wonder , though , why @entity32 have been so keen to sell him back to an @entity111 club , even if international team - mate @entity112 does think he is a much - changed individual			1
‘ @entity113 has matured since he has been back in @entity42 , ’ said @entity112			0
‘ he will be the first to admit when he was younger he made some mistakes — but he is not that player anymore			0
’ @entity19 has already improved a good number of players at @entity23			2
@entity0 was a better player when he left , @entity0 — who he had huge reservations over — has trained on while @entity119 is a far better player and person after two years working with @entity19			1
the @entity121 clearly has flair for this part of the job and maybe he can prove the sceptics wrong			0
if he does , it will be some achievement			0
@entity20 will need love and attention and , just as importantly , will expect to play every week as a through - the - middle no 9			1
he is not a flexible footballer			0
on @entity131 , it is time to light the blue touch paper and stand back			0
growing up : @entity112 thinks his @entity42 team - mate @entity20 is maturing and improving as a player couple : the @entity5 striker and his partner @entity136 in @entity137 over the summer sending a message : @entity20 with his famous ' @entity140 ? ' t - shirt at @entity141 in 2011 video i 've got nothing against @entity20 - @entity145			1
