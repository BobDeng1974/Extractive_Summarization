after catching an octopus , holidaymaker @entity0 followed local tradition by killing it and taking it to a taverna to be served for his supper			1
that is when he discovered this was no ordinary specimen – it was a ‘ hexapus ’ with only six legs instead of the usual eight			1
the creature found during a snorkelling trip in @entity18 is believed to be only the second recorded worldwide			1
catch : @entity0 his daughter @entity20 , ten , and son @entity22 , six admire the six legged octopus or hexapus which they found while on holiday in @entity18 fishing : the specimen was pulled from the sea by @entity30 citizen @entity0 as he went snorkelling in @entity18 @entity31 : the chef refused to cook it for him but he fried it himself and served it with tomato and lemon father - of - two mr @entity40 , 49 , took it to a local taverner where a chef cooked it and served it with tomato , lemon and a lettuce leaf			1
it was only then that he checked with a friend who is a biologist – and felt sick at what he had done			2
the first known hexapus was found off @entity54 in 2008 and taken to @entity55			1
nicknamed @entity57 , he was then released back into the sea where he has probably died of natural causes as their maximum life span is five years			1
a repentant mr @entity40 said : ‘ it tasted just like a normal octopus but now i feel really bad			0
‘ when we caught it , there was nothing to suggest it was any different or had been damaged			0
net : the chef told @entity70 he should have let the octopus live because it was so rare the unfortunate moment that @entity40 ' son @entity22 ( left ) killed the six legged octopus ( right ) beach : @entity70 finishes off the rare hexapus while his daughter @entity20 and son @entity77 ‘ i thought it had been born with six tentacles			1
we go to @entity18 every year and when we catch an octopus , we do the same thing so we just did not think about it			1
‘ i wanted to find out more , but there was no internet where we were			0
i then called my friend who is a biologist and he told me it was true and i was horrified			0
’ mr @entity40 , who was born in @entity18 but is now a @entity30 citizen living in @entity92 , caught the hexapus with his daughter @entity20 , ten , and son @entity22 , six , off the @entity96 peninsula			1
the mechanical engineer has given details to the @entity99 in @entity100 to increase awareness of the wild hexapus			2
tentacles : it was only the second hexapus ever found , the first being in @entity105 holiday : the family inspect the hexapus before killing and eating it ‘ it is the least that i can do given my ignorance and guilt that i feel for killing such a rare animal , ’ he said			2
biologists said the hexapus is the result of a natal abnormality in a common octopus ( octopus vulgaris ) , not a new species			2
professor @entity121 , a marine biology expert at @entity122 , said : ‘ it is rare to find an octopus like this			0
‘ there is every possibility it could have grown an abnormality in early development			0
‘ there is nothing to suggest it is a different species			0
another explanation is it could have been injured and healed over time			0
’ day out : the family travel to @entity18 every year and frequently catch and cook wild octopi catch of the day : @entity70 's son @entity22 holds the six legged octopus or hexapus @entity57 was found in 2008 @entity57 was found off the coast of @entity54 in 2008 in a lobster pot and was the first six - tentacled octopus found			1
he was named after @entity141 , who had six wives			0
he was held at @entity55 , northern @entity143 , and was an attraction in an exhibit named @entity146			0
it is thought that his tentacles are a result of a natural abnormality , and he was not involved in an accident			0
after being taken from the sea , he was transferred to the @entity153 , @entity105 , which , in turn , donated him to the @entity155			2
he is thought to have been the first of his kind			0
the @entity55 's displays supervisor @entity158 said at the time : ' we 've scoured the internet and talked to lots of other aquariums and no - one has ever heard of another case of a [ hexapus ]			1

@entity0 pulled the hexapus from the sea when snorkelling in @entity18
it 's believed to be only the second recorded specimen worldwide
