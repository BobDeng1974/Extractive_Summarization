the teams on the fringe of the race for @entity4 places next season have been given a boost by the @entity8 semi-final draw			0
after @entity11 and @entity12 were kept apart , a final between the two could result in an extra @entity14 place being awarded to the @entity15			1
some clubs might regard a place in @entity19 â€™s second - tier competition as an unwanted prize given the demands of thursday night football and the potential for it to disrupt weekly plans and often negatively affect performances in the @entity15			2
@entity11 applaud their travelling fans at @entity27 after claiming a 2 - 1 victory over @entity29 on monday @entity12 and @entity30 will play a replay to decide who will reach the @entity8 semi-final against @entity34 @entity11 striker @entity35 celebrates after scoring against former club @entity29 at @entity27 but clubs such as @entity37 ( currently 7th ) , @entity38 ( 8th ) , @entity39 ( 9th ) or @entity40 ( 10th ) might look upon it as a bonus			1
there are three @entity14 places up for grabs for @entity46 teams , with one spot going to the fifth - placed side in the @entity15 and places going to the winners of the @entity8 and @entity51			0
with @entity54 winning the latter competition and all but guaranteed a top - four finish , their spot would go to the team who finish sixth			0
in the @entity8 , if the winners have already qualified for @entity19 via the @entity15 , their place goes to the runners - up			0
but with @entity11 and @entity12 likely to finish in the top six , a final between the two would mean the last @entity14 spot going to the club in seventh			1
@entity68 of @entity34 celebrates scoring his goal to send his side into the @entity8 semi-finals @entity74 or @entity75 , in action during saturday 's 0 - 0 draw , await @entity11 in the @entity8 semi-final			2

@entity19 *regulars* @entity11 face either @entity74 or @entity75 at @entity79
top four *hopefuls* @entity12 have to beat @entity30 to face @entity34
an @entity11 vs @entity84 final could result in an extra @entity14 place being awarded to the @entity15
