it was as though ‘ @entity2 ’ was a banned word			1
you were exceedingly hard - pressed to find any mention of @entity7 ’s forthcoming @entity6 glamour tie at the @entity8 on saturday			1
there was no excited chatter outside the ground , none of those awful half - and - half scarves on sale			2
there were no promotional posters anywhere with ‘ sold out ’ slapped across them and the @entity19 announcer did n’t see fit to mention it until after the final whistle			0
the only reference to the biggest game in the club ’s recent history came on the tickets page — not that there are any left — and the fixture list			0
you see , while cup ties like wednesday ’s are a nice distraction , @entity7 are increasingly of the belief that such fixtures can become commonplace			1
@entity35 ( right ) celebrates after scoring to put @entity7 2 - 0 ahead against @entity36 on saturday a fan makes his way towards the @entity8 ahead of the @entity39 on saturday with five goals from five different scorers , the @entity40 are back on top of the @entity44 after beating @entity36 in an exhilarating advert for football at this level			1
@entity49 and @entity2 , you have been warned			1
this may be an excursion to the seaside but it ’ll be far from pleasurable			0
‘ we ca n’t show them too much respect , ’ said @entity7 ’s star striker @entity54 , who has now scored 12 goals this season , including the winner against @entity58 in the last round			1
‘ they are a @entity63 team but we want to beat them			2
we ’re not going to set up at home to protect a 0 - 0 , we want to score goals and show them what we ’re about , how we play			2
’ @entity7 's @entity54 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity36 's @entity69 on saturday @entity54 , who ironically was recommended to manager @entity70 by @entity36 boss @entity71 , scored in the 89th minute to finally kill off the @entity74 side ’s spirited challenge and send his team top on goal difference			1
it is @entity7 ’s 12th match without defeat in all competitions and @entity54 ’s form is just scratching the surface of the attacking threat @entity2 will have to deal with			1
the @entity40 are the leading scorers in the top four divisions with 44 in 21 games and are ready to expose the @entity86 ’ often fragile defence			1
saturday ’s outstanding performer was @entity89 , who got the ball rolling after just 38 seconds , with further goals coming from @entity35 , @entity92 and @entity93 before @entity54 rounded it off			0
they were stylish finishes too — @entity35 started and finished the move that led to his goal , @entity92 produced a superb curling shot and @entity93 bent home a lovely free - kick			2
@entity93 ( right ) scores from a free kick to put @entity7 4 - 2 ahead on saturday ‘ the way we ’re playing you ’re going to get the chances , ’ said @entity54 , the 22 - year - old who joined for £ 3million from @entity103 last summer , of the team ’s attacking approach			1
‘ the team ’s not just relying on the strikers			0
five different goalscorers today shows that we ’re getting goals from different positions			0
’ @entity70 was suffering from flu so delegated post-match media duties to assistant @entity117 but he ’ll certainly feel perkier following this result as he prepares to go head - to - head with friend and mentor @entity49			1
for @entity36 , it was a disappointing and disorienting afternoon			1
disappointing in that they scored three goals away from home and lost			0
disorienting in that they took to the field in all - white to a predictable reaction			2
‘ why the f * * * are we in white ? ’ and ‘ are we @entity137 in disguise ? ’ sang the travelling support for most of the first half while waving anything blue above their heads , drawing sympathetic applause from the home fans			0
as if @entity141 ’s decision to change their principal colours to red is n’t bad enough , he ’s dressed them like bitter rivals @entity137 on the road too			0
‘ this is a yardstick , ’ said @entity71			0
‘ @entity70 ’s done a wonderful job here			2
we need to work harder to get to their level			0
’ an eight - goal thriller — and the week ’s main attraction is still to come			2
@entity36 fans dressed as @entity155 elves cheer from the stands at the @entity8 in @entity7 performance of the weekend @entity159 ’s renaissance under @entity160 continued as they thrashed @entity162 6 - 1 at @entity163 ’s			1
@entity159 have lost one in seven since @entity160 joined from @entity165 and have now hit the relative heights of 15th			0
@entity167 , 18 , scored a first career hat - trick before half - time and @entity160 said : ‘ we toyed with him this week about how many goals he ’s scored			0
he said “ one ” and you could see a look of disgust with himself			0
’ @entity159 manager @entity160 celebrates his side 's fourth goal in the 6 - 1 win against @entity162			1

@entity7 take on @entity2 in the @entity6 fifth round on wednesday
@entity70 's side beat @entity36 5 - 3 at the @entity8
the @entity40 are now back in top spot in the *championship*
