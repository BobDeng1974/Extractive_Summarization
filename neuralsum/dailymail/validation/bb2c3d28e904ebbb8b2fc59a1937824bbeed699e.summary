@entity0 did get a second chance as a manager in @entity4 football			2
what he did n’t get was a third			0
having tried and failed at an elite club , @entity7 — he left after the infamous loss to @entity10 — @entity0 managed @entity11 and then @entity12			1
on october 9 , 2012 , when he was sacked after a run of two wins in 11 matches , @entity12 were 22nd in @entity17			1
@entity0 , at the @entity18 , tried and failed at @entity7 before spells at @entity11 and @entity12 @entity0 , pictured in charge of @entity7 , left the club after their infamous loss to @entity10 @entity0 believes black managers do n’t get the second chances afforded their white counterparts , but where could he have gone from there ? nothing in his record suggested he would thrive in the lower leagues , his experience at @entity7 will have damaged his appeal to bigger clubs			1
@entity0 was stymied by circumstances , not the colour of his skin			0
@entity37 , his assistant , has not worked since , either — and neither have three of the four managers subsequently employed and ditched by @entity12			2
@entity39 , formerly of @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , and now boss at @entity45 the experience of @entity39 ( @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity45 ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ) or @entity54 ( @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity52 , @entity59 ) supports the theory of the managerial @entity61 , but suggests that once a black coach is on board , his opportunity is no different from that of a white one			0
the problem is getting the elusive first job , not where to go if it does n’t work out at @entity12			1
we know what happens then , black or white .			0

@entity0 left @entity7 after their loss to @entity10
he was later sacked by @entity12 after only two wins in 11 matches
but @entity0 *claims* black managers do *n't* get second chances afforded their white counterparts *...* but the problem is getting the elusive first job
