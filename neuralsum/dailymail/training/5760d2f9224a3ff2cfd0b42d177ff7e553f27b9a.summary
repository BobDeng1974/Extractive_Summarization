weight loss expert @entity0 believes that fat shaming is the best way to encourage people to lose weight and now he is encouraging people to tell their overweight loved ones if they 're fat from calorie - counting apps to old fashioned slimming clubs , there are plenty of ways to motivate yourself to lose weight			1
but would being called fat give you the final push you needed to shift the surplus pounds ? weight loss expert @entity0 believes so and now he is encouraging people to tell their overweight loved ones they ’re fat			1
the @entity20 star is sick of people branding ‘ fat shaming ’ as bullying and wants the nation to stop hiding behind political correctness			1
@entity0 uses what he calls ' constructive fat shaming ' as part of his approach			1
whilst some may find it offensive , he claims he ’s built his success by telling clients ' to their face that they ’re fat and then working with them to develop an 80 - 20 regime whilst training them in self - hypnosis			1
@entity0 claims people are too scared to tell the truth , but if they want to help others avoid health problems and early death then it ’s time to speak up			1
despite many saying fat shaming is cruel , he claims that it can be a huge motivator to shed the excess pounds when done in the right way			1
as a straight - talking coach , @entity0 is regularly labelled '' nasty ' for his blunt approach , but he says constructive fat shaming is an effective weight loss method			1
@entity0 , who calls himself the ' life b * * * * ' , said : ' whenever anyone discusses fat shaming , they automatically say it ’s mean but this is n’t the case			1
in actual fact , fat shaming and telling people they ’re overweight is a huge motivator			1
' it ’s about being constructive , you would n’t want a family member or friend to die early from health complications so if you can do something to help them , then you should			0
' @entity0 recommends using the word ' fat ' constructively by speaking in a ' considered ' tone			1
he also believes you should judge someone 's eating habit rather than them as a person and remind them about the realities of being fat			1
' is it ok to be fat ? , ' he asks			0
' it 's ok as long as you remember that you 're not going to live as long as your slim and healthy friends and relatives			2
it 's ok to be fat unless you want to be able to lead a full , active life and play with your grandchildren			2
' remember , it 's the slim and healthy people who pay for your treatment when your health fails			2
why should we pay for your lack of self - control ? ' @entity90 , 34 , weighed 19st and was a size 24 , left , when she decided it was time to make a change			1
she followed @entity0 's programme and is now size 12 and weighs 12st ' but really though , ' he continues			1
' you know it 's not ok to be fat when every time you look in the mirror someone you vaguely remember as being you when you were slim says , " let me out you fat f * * * * *			1
i 've had enough "			0
listen to your inner voice			0
' ' i ’m tired of being labelled as nasty , i admit that i do tell people they ’re fat but that is not bullying			2
i have worked with over 2,000 clients who have thanked me for being so direct with them because it gave them the motivation they needed			0
' i myself used to be fat and if it was n’t for me looking in the mirror one day and telling myself i looked awful , i would never have been motivated enough to lose weight or get to where i am today			0
' as a nation , we need to stop being so frightened of it , if we felt someone close to us was drinking or smoking too much then we ’d tell them			0
it ’s the same with weight , obesity can lead to serious illness so we should n’t be scared to save our loved ones			2
' i want to teach people how to use constructive fat shaming so they have guidance and support if they want to approach overweight loved ones			1
' @entity90 , pictured with @entity0 , says that meeting him and following his approach was one of the best things she 's done			1
' he taught me that it 's about changing your life as a whole and not just finding a short - term diet solution , ' she said one of his success stories is @entity90 , 34 , who halved her dress size thanks to @entity0			1
@entity90 weighed 19st and was a size 24 when she decided it was time to make a change			1
@entity90 , who had struggled with her size from a young age , joined @entity141 to help her slim down			1
despite seeing some success from the diet , @entity90 was unable to keep the weight off and soon began to pile the pounds back on			2
as a straight - talking coach , @entity0 is regularly labelled as ' nasty ' and ' cruel ' for his blunt approach , but he says constructive fat shaming is an effective weight loss method she became a yo - yo dieter and soon after her marriage broke down , @entity90 found herself at 19st again			1
the mother - of - two from @entity153 knew an inflexible diet was n’t enough for her to keep weight off in the long - term and sought help from @entity0			2
@entity90 bought his book , @entity159 , and attended one of his seminars in @entity162			2
she rapidly started losing weight by following an 80/20 approach rather than obsessing over her food intake			0
before she knew it , she had lost three stone within the space of three months			0
@entity90 shed seven stone in total thanks to @entity0 ’s approach and is now a healthy and stable size 12			1
his diet plan includes a fruit salad and apple juice for lunch , herby chicken , sweet potatoes and vegetables is on the menu with a wholegrain scone and strawberries for pudding			0
for dinner , @entity0 recommends a leafy salad with poached salmon			2
she said : ' i ’ve struggled with my weight for as long as i can remember			0
i ’ve always been big , even when i was at school			0
' i joined @entity141 and lost weight but i soon realised that having to constantly monitor my food was n’t going to work in the long run and i put it all back on			0
' meeting @entity0 and following his approach was one of the best things i ’ve done			2
he taught me that it ’s about changing your life as a whole and not just finding a short - term diet solution			0
' i now eat healthily most of the time and really enjoy exercising and that ’s something i never thought i ’d say especially when i was at 19st			2
@entity0 does n’t let you make excuses for yourself , which is great			2
i needed to be pushed into shape and that ’s exactly what he did , he says it how it is and is so supportive			0
' a lot of people do take up diets to lose weight , i ’ve been there myself , but to keep the weight off you really need to be making lifestyle changes and that ’s exactly what @entity0 teaches			1
' i lost seven stone , it ’s not been easy but it ’s never felt like i ’m on a diet			0
it ’s about having everything in moderation and exercising regularly			0
i ’ve never felt better			0
' the key here using my 80/20 regime is that you avoid living a life of denial			0
my clients reduce their calorie intake by making an improvement in portion control and also the quality of food but there is no rigid denial because they still eat a bit of what they fancy			0
typical day before 80 - 20 breakfast two slices of toast with marmalade banana cup of tea lunch cheese and tomato sandwich packet of crisps chocolate bar can of fizzy drink dinner chicken with mixed vegetable @entity258 trifle and ice cream half bottle of wine chocolate bar supper cheese and biscuits cup of tea transforming this to my 80 - 20 regime breakfast two slices of toast with marmalade cup of tea lunch fresh chicken salad without dressing a small chocolate bar bottle of water dinner lean chicken breast with mixed vegetables fresh fruit salad glass of wine supper carrot sticks with low fat dip exercise the reality is that most people do not want to undertake vigorous exercise			0
therefore it is important to encourage them to exercise for pleasure so it does not become a chore			0
such exercises can include : walking horse riding @entity301 swimming salsa dancing my message here is that the gym is often short - lived because people may become bored			0
i advise people to blend around 45 mins of exercise per day as well as embracing my 80 - 20 meal plan regime .			0
