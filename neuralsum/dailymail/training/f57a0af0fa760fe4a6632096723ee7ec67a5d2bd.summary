@entity0 , the extremist @entity1 group in @entity2 , has released a video that shows the beheading of a man who identifies himself the pilot of a missing @entity2 @entity8 jet			1
the video that emerged yesterday also allegedly features @entity0 leader @entity10 - a terrorist who @entity2 's military claimed to have killed			1
officials announced last week that @entity10 was dead and that a man who had been posing as the group 's leader in the videos had been killed after fighting with troops in the far northeast			1
he claims that the group are implementing shariah law in parts of @entity2 but the new 36 - minute video appears to show @entity10 , in combat fatigues and black rubber boots , standing on the back of a pick - up truck and firing an anti-aircraft gun into the air			1
standing in front of three camouflaged vans and flanked by four heavily armed , masked fighters , he then speaks for 16 minutes in @entity34 and the @entity36 language widely spoken in northern @entity2			2
there was no indication of where or when the video was shot			0
@entity10 appears in separate images from the violence			2
the heavily bearded @entity10 , who appeared to be the same man as those in previous clips released by the group , said the military 's claim that he was dead was propaganda			1
speaking to the camera , the man says : ' here i am , alive , and i will remain alive until the day @entity53 takes away my breath			0
claims : @entity10 , in combat fatigues and black rubber boots , standing on the back of a pick - up truck and firing an anti-aircraft gun into the air			1
he says that the military 's claim that he was dead was propaganda ' even if you kill me ... it will not stop us imposing @entity1 rule ... we are still in our @entity1 state , reigning and teaching the @entity69			2
' there have been two previous claims by @entity2 that @entity10 had been killed or ' may be dead ' but @entity0 later issued video denials			1
security analysts and the @entity74 have also questioned the credibility of the @entity2 military 's claim			1
footage shows charred plane wreckage that appear to have @entity2 military markings , bolstering the group 's claims that it shot down a fighter plane			1
in the video , a man is seen kneeling in a camouflage vest with his right hand in a sling , with a fighter hovering over him with an axe , which is later used in his beheading			0
speaking in @entity92 , the victim identifies himself as a wing commander in the @entity2 @entity8 and says he was undertaking a mission in @entity96 area of northeast @entity98 state			2
he says : ' we were shot down and our aircraft crashed			0
to this day i do n't know the whereabouts of my second pilot			0
' two pilots and an alpha jet have been missing since mid-september when it left the northeastern town of @entity108 on a bombing mission against @entity0			1
in the footage , @entity0 fighters are seen apparently picking through the wreckage of the downed @entity114 aircraft and the military 's green and white logo is clearly visible			1
but air force spokesman air commodore @entity117 said : ' for any group to claim they shot it down is mere propaganda and rubbish			0
' military top brass suggested images of the plane could have been manipulated but said they were studying the claims in the video , even though they had not seen it			2
in a statement on its website , @entity2 's @entity129 said the video did not indicate when it was shot with a screen time or date or provide any proof that @entity10 was alive			1
' as far as we are concerned , the individual who was appearing in video and claiming to be the leader of the terrorist group was killed in the @entity141 battle in september			2
wreckage : in the footage , @entity0 fighters are seen apparently picking through the wreckage of the downed @entity114 aircraft and the military 's green and white logo is clearly visible			1
' the resemblance of the corpse and that of the eccentric character was incontrovertible			0
his identity was equally corroborated by people who knew him before we announced his death			0
' the video contains images of extreme violence , including graphic scenes of an amputation , a stoning to death and lashings			0
elsewhere in the new video , the militant leader said the group had implemented strict @entity1 law in the towns that it had captured in the northeast in recent weeks			2
he says : ' we are running our caliphate , our @entity1 caliphate			0
we follow the @entity69 ... in the land of @entity53			0
' brutal : the video shows footage of a man being stoned to death for adultery , another having his right hand cut off at the wrist for theft			0
above , @entity10 speaks in the new 36 - minute video released yesterday the video shows footage of a man being stoned to death for adultery , another having his right hand cut off at the wrist for theft and a man and a woman receiving 100 lashes for sex out of wedlock			1
crowds of men , women and children are seen watching the punishments			0
the scenes of graphic violence are not unprecedented but come as other groups in the wider jihadi network , particularly @entity203 militants in @entity204 and @entity205 , have issued similar footage			0
in a @entity0 video obtained on august 24 , footage showed the apparent execution of about 20 men captured in town of @entity212 in @entity98 and two others beaten to death with rocks and pick - axes			2
doubts : in a statement on its website , @entity2 's @entity129 said the video did not indicate when it was shot with a screen time or date or provide any proof that @entity10 was alive @entity223 , deputy director of the @entity224 at the @entity225 in @entity226 , said @entity0 has likely adapted its videos to model the is group , which has captured global attention by broadcasting grotesque violence			1
extremist groups ' learn from each other , certainly in terms of communication ' , said @entity223 , describing @entity10 as a ' savvy media character '			0
but , he added , the influence of the @entity228 organisation on @entity0 is likely minimal , describing the group as still focused on @entity2 with limited interest in @entity241 jihadis			1
' i 'd be wary of the notion that the @entity244 drives everything , ' @entity223 said .			0
