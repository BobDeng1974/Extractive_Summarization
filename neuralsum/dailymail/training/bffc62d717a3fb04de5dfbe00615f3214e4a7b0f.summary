here are three things to know about new @entity2 sanctions against @entity3 over a cyberattack on @entity5 , whose movie depicting the fictional assassination of @entity3 's leader has infuriated @entity10 , which denies responsibility for the cyberattack : @entity10 's rhetoric over the weekend , which included a vow that the new sanctions and @entity2 's ' inveterate repugnancy and hostility ' would not weaken the @entity3 's 1.2 - million - strong military , is probably directed as much at a domestic audience as it is at @entity20			1
the @entity2 imposed new sanctions friday on @entity23 government officials and the country 's defense industry for a cyberattack against @entity5 , insisting that @entity10 was to blame despite lingering doubts by the cyber community some @entity3 watchers believe that sanctions help to insulate @entity10 from taking responsibility for its failures , and allow @entity33 , the 30 - something leader who took power in late 2011 after his father 's death , to better solidify his power and bolster his domestic image as a strong leader			1
@entity10 , the argument goes , uses tension with the outside world , in general , and sanctions , in particular , to whip up always high anti- @entity2 sentiment			2
this , in turn , allows the leadership to justify its inability to feed many of its people and the continuing push to develop nuclear bombs it says are needed to defend against @entity20			0
the new measures are unlikely to make much of a difference in @entity3 , which has been bombarded by sanctions for decades and which has woven an obsession with self - reliance into its national psyche			0
some analysts say @entity20 and others have the ability , should they choose , to apply more severe financial measures to hurt the @entity3 's leadership			2
but many others point out that a raft of multilateral penalties from the @entity68 , as well as national sanctions from @entity20 , @entity70 and others meant to punish the government and sidetrack its nuclear ambitions , have done nothing to derail @entity10 's pursuit of a nuclear tipped missile that could reach @entity2 's mainland			1
the most recent sanctions , which target 10 @entity23 government officials and three organizations , including @entity10 's primary intelligence agency and state - run arms dealer , will have a limited impact because @entity3 will likely assign other people or organizations to take over the work of those targeted , analysts say			1
the measures probably wo n't hurt recent efforts to improve ties between the rival @entity91			0
@entity3 have been at each other 's throats , both figuratively and literally , since the @entity95 was divided at the end of @entity97 into a @entity2 backed capitalist south and a @entity100 - backed communist north			2
in the decades since they were founded in 1948 , the @entity91 have established elaborate patterns of communicating their intentions toward each other , even as they trade bombastic rhetoric and threats			0
the @entity108 's comments over the weekend have been largely viewed in @entity109 as leaving the door open for warming ties as they did n't specifically criticize @entity112 .			0
