by @entity0 it ’s more often than not thought that consuming more energy will ultimately have an increasingly negative effect on the environment			1
but is that necessarily the case ? experts have argued that increased energy consumption might actually be good , because we ’ll be less dependent on nature			1
they argue that human innovation and ingenuity will eventually pull through and save us from a future climate - related disaster			1
a paper called ' our high - energy planet ' says that decoupling our planet from the environment means we can consume more and more energy without damaging the environment			1
as we move to more cleaner forms of energy such as solar ( shown ) , we are beginning to decouple ourselves from environmental impact the comments were made in a paper called ‘ our high - energy planet ’ , which was discussed at the think tank @entity27 2014 in @entity28 in late june			1
a team of scientists has discovered that a giant ' burp ' of carbon dioxide from the @entity38 helped trigger the end of last ice age , around 17,000 years @entity30 recent study , led by dr @entity31 of the @entity32 in @entity33 , found that changes in ocean circulation in the @entity38 caused a massive outpouring of @entity44			1
this was released from the deep ocean into the atmosphere , helping to warm the planet sufficiently to trigger the end of the ice age			2
previously , scientists have suggested that the @entity50 and @entity51 were the only places likely to release @entity44 as a result of glaciers retreating , due to their deep water formation			0
however , a change in rainfall over the @entity38 region caused by the @entity60 monsoon and the westerly storm track made the ocean surface saltier and less buoyant , allowing it to form deep water , say the scientists			0
this resulted in co2 stored in the deep @entity38 being released into the atmosphere , where it helped warm the planet and melt back the ice sheets that covered much of the @entity71			0
the paper says that a massive expansion of energy systems in the @entity75 is turning our world into a high - energy planet			1
but , the authors say , this is not necessarily a bad thing			0
as we move to more cleaner forms of energy such as solar , wind and hydro , we are beginning to decouple ourselves from environmental impact			1
‘ the way we produce and use energy will become increasingly clean not by limiting its consumption , but by using expanded access to energy to unleash human ingenuity in support of innovating toward an equitable , low - carbon global energy system , ’ say the researchers			1
thus , as our sources of energy become cleaner and greener , there is not necessarily any reason to reduce the amount of energy we consume , once it is coming from the right source			0
in @entity107 , for example , 5.3 per cent of the country ’s energy in 2013 was provided by solar power			0
by 2020 they estimate 35 per cent of their energy will be from renewable sources , rising to 100 per cent by 2050			0
the one major issue could be the boom in energy consumption from countries in developing nations but , the experts say , providing them with the right knowledge could prevent any further ecological disaster			1
this graph shows the rate at which the populations of various countries have increased in their access to electricity			0
it shows how the entire populations of places like the @entity131 and @entity132 have had access to electricity for some time , but other developing countries are only now going through an electricity boom innovation is the key to reducing emissions while expanding energy access , the experts claim			1
for instance , in order to reduce energy poverty within their borders , @entity142 and @entity143 are pioneering the use of advanced nuclear generation ( pictured ) and carbon capture and storage ( @entity152 ) more than one billion people globally lack access to electricity , and billions more burn wood and dung for their basic energy needs			2
the report outlines a radically new framework for meeting the energy needs of the global poor			0
according to the authors , the massive expansion of energy systems , mainly carried out in the rapidly urbanising global @entity165 , is the only robust , coherent , and ethical response to the global challenges we face , climate change among them			2
' the time has come to embrace a high - energy planet , ' they write			1
innovation is the key to reducing emissions while expanding energy access , they claim			0
for instance , in order to reduce energy poverty within their borders , @entity142 and @entity143 are pioneering the use of advanced nuclear generation and carbon capture and storage ( @entity152 )			2
‘ it will take tremendous effort , capital , and political will to ensure that the ongoing expansionof the energy sector in developing nations provides all people with access to energy they can afford as soon as possible , and to support efforts that will make that energy progressively cleaner , ' the researchers write			1
‘ rather than limiting energy access and consumption on the basis of their potential climate change impacts , a coherent strategy for human development begins with the assumption that energy equity is necessary for a just , prosperous , and environmentally sustainable society			2
' and , they conclude , the negative climate effects of moving towards a high - energy planet can be negated , as long as humanity decouples its power consumption from the environment			1
energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			2
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			2
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as £ 300 a year			0
prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0

researchers at think tank in @entity28 discussed higher energy usage
they said if we ' decouple ' from the environment it will be a good thing
the advancement of clean and low - carbon *technology* means we do *n't* to be so energy - *conscious* , say the researchers
and applying those same lessons to developing countries could help ensure there is no climate disaster
