by @entity0 a cyclist has suffered a broken cheekbone and concussion after a surprise attack by a goose			1
@entity6 was riding alone near her home in @entity8 , @entity9 on june 10 when she saw the gaggle of geese and goslings crossing ahead of her along the @entity14			1
speaking to @entity15 , she said that she thought she would be able to ride past them as they left the path - but she was wrong			1
when geese attack : @entity6 was left with a fractured cheekbone , concussion , loose teeth and a scar beneath her eyebrow after she was attacked by a @entity25 while on a cycling trail ' i misjudged how fast i was going and the goose misjudged my intentions , ' she told the channel			1
as she neared the group , she saw the last goose turn and look at her			2
' what i remember is the goose giving me the evil eye and then the goose wrapping its wings around my head , and i ca n't see and i hear myself screaming			1
' she was thrown from her bike and , even though she was wearing a helmet , she was knocked unconscious and landed in poison ivy on the trail , @entity37 reported			1
@entity43 : @entity44 , pictured on the @entity9 trail where she was attacked , said she saw the geese and thought she could get past them without a problem - but one turned on her and attacked her face @entity43 : she said the large bird wrapped its wings around her face before she fell to the ground threat : she said she often sees the geese on the trail and thinks they were just protecting their young when she came to , she remembers struggling to drag herself to a nearby road where she was able to flag down a passerby who called 911 and waited with her for an ambulance to arrive			1
@entity44 spent five days in hospital after suffering a concussion , fractured cheekbone , face lacerations and loose teeth , @entity15 reported			1
an image taken 48 hours after the attack in hospital shows her scratched face , black eye and scars beneath her eyebrow			1
her helmet and sunglasses probably prevented further damage , she believes			2
@entity44 , who has been left with a scar beneath her eyebrow , said she is not physically ready to return to her bike , but she will be more careful when she does			2
wary : @entity44 's husband @entity82 , pictured together , said that they have often seen geese along the trail but now no to exercise much more caution @entity88 geese are extremely adaptable so are often found in urban areas			1
they are particularly attracted to mowed lawns , golf courses , parks , and similar areas next to open water , which means conflicts can arise			2
they are aggressive defenders of their nests and young so you should do not approach them			0
they may charge and can inflict injuries			0
if you see a goose 's neck go vertical and straight , it is wary of some danger , and if you see it begin to rapidly lower and raise its head in a pumping motion , they are about to attack			2
in this situation , do not look away from the goose and back away slowly , @entity113 suggests			0
if one flies at you , duck while still facing the bird			0
you can prevent confrontations by never feeding geese , placing flags outside your home , using low - power lasers or fencing off their territories , according to the @entity127 @entity126			1
' you have to know they are going to attack if they feel threatened , ' she said			0
when she was in the hospital , she learned that attacks by @entity25 are not uncommon			2
@entity133 , manager of the @entity134 at the @entity135 , told @entity37 that attacks almost always involve an adult trying to protect its young			0
' normally they just fly away , but when they have a nest or young they can not leave them behind so they have to defend them , ' he said			0
@entity88 geese are extremely adaptable so are often found in urban areas			2
they are particularly attracted to mowed lawns , golf courses , parks , and similar areas next to open water , which means conflicts can arise			0
they are aggressive defenders of their nests and young so you should do not approach them too closely , because hey may charge , and can inflict injuries			0
@entity44 warned that , if you see them , you should keep your distance			0
her husband , @entity82 , said they had seen the geese along the trail previously			1
' we went by them			0
i guess we did n't startle them , ' he said			0
' so you just do n't know , so always best to exercise some caution			0

@entity6 was cycling alone on a trail near her home in @entity9 when she saw a gaggle of geese and thought it would be fine to pass them
but as she did , one looked at her and attacked her head - throwing her to the ground and knocking her unconscious
she came to and managed to flag down help before spending five days in hospital with concussion , a broken cheekbone , cuts and loose teeth
