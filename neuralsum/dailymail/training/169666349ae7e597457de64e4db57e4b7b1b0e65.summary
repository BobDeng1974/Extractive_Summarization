by @entity1 - @entity0 follow @ @ riathalsam new shoes , new @entity3			1
sometimes the simplest solution is best and so it came to pass that a change of footwear helped stop @entity8 skidding out of these championships			1
for two - and - a - quarter hours he slipped and stumbled , complaining about his trainers as he blew a one - set lead — losing the next two 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 to @entity13			1
at one stage , in the third set tiebreak , he lunged for a drop shot and got tangled in the net			0
the biggest fish in the draw did n’t look like he was worth keeping			0
then came a signal to @entity21 in the coaching seats and down came a new pair of shoes			2
he found his footing , his backhand and , more significantly , distracted himself for long enough to win the final two sets 6 - 2 , 6 - 2			1
on the slide : @entity8 had trouble with his footing against @entity13 footwear : @entity8 called for a change of shoes to get back in the match ‘ maybe with the shoes it was just a mental thing , ’ he said			1
‘ whatever , it worked			0
’ what is in no doubt is the top seed will need to tighten up his act for his semi-final against @entity44			1
normally so composed , it was surprising to see the @entity46 riled by the noise drifting into @entity48 1 as @entity50 ’s defence of his title ended in the central arena			1
‘ i think both of us thought it was too much in a way , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ with @entity50 losing in straight sets , it was obviously a result that all stadiums , even on @entity60 , wanted to see			1
i said to the chair umpire , “ let ’s just stop the match , put it live on the big screen and let ’s watch it until they ’re done			0
it ’s going to be better for all of us ”			0
’ with every groan , he got more agitated			0
his backhand , normally so effective , lost its direction , while @entity13 emerged from an attack of nerves in the first set to dominate with huge groundstrokes			1
going the distance : @entity8 needed five sets to beat @entity13 but in winning the third set he committed the error he felt turned the match in @entity8 ’s favour			1
he had just broken the no 1 seed for 6 - 5 when he followed through on a smash and hit the net with his racket in the first point of his service game			2
he went on to lose his serve , which seemed academic when he won the tiebreak 7 - 4 , but the effect lingered			2
‘ that changed the momentum around , ’ said @entity13			2
‘ i ended up using too much energy for that third set			0
’ then came the new shoes , a bit of silence outside and , ultimately , the turnaround as @entity8 broke serve twice in each of the fourth and fifth sets			1
at times he was brilliant , dominating the rallies and reading @entity13 ’s much - improved serve			1
but the concern will be that he has not regularly reached the levels he is known for			0
if there are any chinks in his armour it is likely @entity44 will find them			2
one to beat : @entity44 is the form player on grass this championships @entity8 said of the @entity110 : ‘ the fact that he has n’t lost a match in the grass court season this year says enough about his quality			1
also winning against @entity50 on grass			2
‘ i ’m sure many people look at him as a potential @entity121 winner			0
maybe here , maybe in the @entity121 to follow			0
his game has improved a lot			0
‘ a new wave is able to challenge the best and contend for @entity121 titles			0
’ with that , he was asked about those shoes			2
‘ i have to think about that , ’ he said			0
‘ if they ’re lucky , i ’ll wear them			0

@entity8 beat @entity13 in five sets in quarter - final on @entity48 1
he will face @entity50 *'s* *conqueror* @entity44 in semi-finals
@entity8 was slipping on court before *deciding* on change of shoes
