@entity0 is demonstrating his 360 - degree flick for a film crew at @entity4 ’s training ground when coach @entity5 strides over			1
‘ we taught him that trick , you know , ’ jokes @entity5 before slapping the @entity4 winger on the back and urging him to make the hour - and - a - half commute back to his home in @entity10 , west @entity11			1
‘ we ’ve got a big game against @entity21 and he needs his rest , ’ added @entity5 , before wandering off with his mug of tea to resume a conversation with assistant manager @entity18 in the canteen			0
@entity0 hopes to start scoring more goals for @entity4 this season @entity0 , pulled off a memorable tricked last week , which saw him face away from the pitch with @entity28 ' @entity27 putting him under pressure the @entity4 star has the ball under control , using both feet , as @entity27 closes in ‘ people talked about that bit of skill at @entity28 , but did we win ? ’ @entity0 asks of himself			1
‘ did i score a goal ? no. did i create a goal ? no. ’ even so , it is difficult to tire of watching @entity0 ’s move , trying to figure out how he completed an electrifying three - point turn and flick off his right boot that took him past @entity27 at @entity44			1
that was the official unveiling , but the improvisation and the invention was perfected during his years playing on the street near his parents ’ home in @entity51 , north - west @entity11			2
‘ we had to pick a team , so i ’d be @entity54 , my friends would be @entity56 or @entity57 or whoever , and there would be 40 kids trying to beat the keeper to stay in the @entity62 , ’ he said			0
‘ to get through to the next round i had to improvise , to change direction and speed before anyone could anticipate what i was about to do			0
it ’s a difficult move to defend because if you sense i am about to do it , i can double tap in a different direction			0
the slightest touch from @entity0 's right boot plays it over @entity27 and leaves him stranded and he 's off , heading for the byline after the perfect execution of his trick ‘ when @entity27 came towards me i knew it was the time to try it			1
down by the corner flag , no - one expects you to try something like that			2
people think i do n’t know what i ’m going to do next , but it ’s all up here , ’ he says as he places his raspberry protein shake on the table and points to his head			0
on current form , @entity0 , 25 , is one step ahead of the game			1
yet he has come to the @entity95 the long way , via spells in @entity98 , with @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
he was born in @entity103 , @entity104 , and moved to @entity51 with his parents as a young boy			0
football runs in the family			0
@entity109 , a truck driver , played for the @entity110 under 21 team — @entity0 will travel to the @entity112 next month to represent the national team and could be away for six weeks			2
younger brother @entity114 plays non-league for @entity116 and @entity117 , and @entity0 went to watch @entity118 — another brother — playing for @entity119 a couple of weeks back			2
the @entity4 winger talks to @entity122 's @entity121 at the club 's @entity124 training ground @entity0 ( right ) goes flying as he battles for the ball with @entity28 ' @entity127 last saturday the 25 - year - old @entity110 international has received widespread praise for his impressive performances ‘ everybody i know played , it ’s just how it has always been , ’ he added			1
in many ways @entity0 is an old - fashioned winger , a throwback to the days when @entity135 or @entity136 would send a defender off balance with a step - over before skinning their man down the line			1
‘ when i ’m on the ball i want to make something happen and my theory is that if i go into a game and work hard , everything will happen as a result , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ if you do n’t work hard , and the flicks and tricks do n’t come off , then it does n’t go down well with the fans , does it ? ‘ i ’m benefiting as a winger because these days every kid coming through wants to play no 10			2
’ back when @entity0 was a couple of years behind his neighbours @entity158 ( then of @entity159 ) and @entity160 ( @entity28 ) , he played all over the park			1
@entity162 will be dealt a blow when both @entity0 and captain @entity164 leave on international duty left back for @entity166 , right back at @entity167 , central midfield for his county @entity170 and up front for his sunday side			2
‘ at 14 , when i went for a trial at @entity174 i was playing central midfield , but i came to my senses and realised i was a winger			2
’ there are few finer sights in @entity57 football at this moment than @entity0 flying down the wing for @entity4 , fuelled by the injection of confidence given to him by the previous manager , @entity183 , and his new boss @entity162			1
‘ i was intimidated by @entity183 at first , he was scary , ’ admits @entity0 as he reflects on @entity4 ’s remarkable ascent from the drop zone last season			1
‘ you would n’t want to get on his wrong side , but he is a very good tactician and a very good man - manager			2
‘ we also knew of his record of never getting relegated and it played a big part			0
his tactical awareness lifted the players			0
@entity0 admits he was ' intimidated ' by former palace manager @entity183 ( above ) ‘ he knew i could attack , but he also improved me defensively			1
’ speak to the @entity4 coaches at the club ’s @entity124 training centre and they are full of praise for @entity0 ’s determination to improve			1
the @entity4 fitness coach @entity202 has challenged @entity0 to set a new personal best by running 11,000 metres against @entity21 at @entity204 on saturday			1
he smiles at the prospect and @entity4 ’s training ground has been a happier place since @entity162 , who returned to the club in august , urged @entity0 to enjoy life a bit more			1
‘ i met @entity121 last year and he gives me confidence			0
he is always telling me to smile and there ’s no doubt i am playing better this season			0
‘ as a professional i made it late , i did n’t have trials and i did n’t have a manager teaching me			0
i just pinched stuff as i went along			0
’ the 25 - year - old tackles @entity222 defender @entity220 during his team 's 1 - 0 defeat @entity0 has scored two goals in his nine games representing @entity110 he is bashful about the tattoo he had inked on to his right arm — ‘ hope for the best but expect the worst ’ — when he was struggling to get into the first team under @entity231 at @entity101			1
‘ i ’m never getting another , ’ he admits			0
his @entity234 account is maintained by his agent : ‘ i ’m not interested in it because there are too many negative people			0
’ he no longer drinks — just a @entity240 at the @entity241 on saturday evening — and works out in the gym most days at the training ground			0
on thursday , during a practice match towards the end of the training session , he finished off a neat move when he was supplied by @entity248 from the wing			0
@entity0 ( left ) , who has been at @entity4 since 2012 , revealed he no longer drinks it is an area of @entity0 ’s game he accepts he needs to improve if he is to be regarded as one of the best wingers in the top flight			1
since his move to @entity4 in 2012 , @entity0 has scored only four times in nearly 90 appearances			1
‘ i ’ve been unlucky not to score in the past few games			0
i was panicking a bit about not scoring , but i know it will come			0
’ just like his 360 - degree trick , it could be just a matter of time before he delivers something special in front of goal .			0
