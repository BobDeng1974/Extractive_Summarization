there are some things in life , such as putting your finger into a live electrical socket , that you would never try again			0
playing @entity7 at right back in an @entity9 shirt is another			1
to think that a two - time winner of the @entity11 is not considered good enough to play in his own position for the national team is a remarkable call			0
getting a chasing : @entity7 ( right ) labours as @entity17 shows him a clean pair of heels @entity20 : @entity7 ( right ) , who struggled at right back , looks bemused after @entity22 's opener playing @entity7 at right back , just in case @entity23 is injured during the @entity25 , is not a viable alternative			1
this was a training ground experiment that @entity30 was determined to put to the test during one of @entity9 ’s tune - up matches			2
every time an @entity22 player was in possession at the @entity37 , they looked up and hoped to send the ball left , to the feet of @entity17			0
it was a deliberate strategy , designed to unsettle @entity7 after @entity30 's decision to deploy him in @entity9 ’s second choice defence			1
just as @entity7 was adjusting to an unorthodox position , @entity22 went in front with a move that only really got going when his poor clearance fell to @entity17 in the eighth minute			1
@entity9 ’s defence was exposed , brutally as it turned out when @entity48 rose above @entity49 to power his header beyond @entity51			1
rest : @entity7 ( left ) has a much - needed breather during his first - half chasing you could see where @entity30 was going with this and it seemed like a solid idea when he talked it through			2
uncomfortable : @entity9 are unlikely to repeat the @entity7 experiment that ’s what these games are for and the fact that it did n't really work out is no biggie			1
it would be lazy to blame @entity7 for this performance , particularly when he was thrust , unexpectedly , into an unorthodox role			0
when the pressure was on in the final stages of the @entity11 season , the @entity68 midfielder excelled in their engine room			0
it takes time to learn a new position and it was fairly obvious , the quick feet of @entity17 out on @entity22 ’s left , that @entity9 will need to look elsewhere			1
he was n’t helped by the first half indiscipline of @entity79 , who was supposed to be offering some kind of protection to @entity7 down @entity9 ’s right			2
going forward they were dependable , a real threat whenever they combed through @entity22 ’s midfield			2
still , it did n’t feel right			0
@entity30 ’s alternative at right back is @entity49 , for whom he has a soft spot despite the defender 's failure to get off the floor to challenge @entity94			1
when you think of @entity9 ’s first - choice central defensive partnership - @entity98 and @entity99 - there is a feeling of safety and security			1
neither of them are world beaters but they have huge experience in the @entity11			0
@entity49 and @entity107 just do n’t offer that			2
for some players it takes 10 or more caps before they feel comfortable playing for the national team			0
with these two you wonder whether it will ever happen at all			0
soft centre : @entity107 ( left ) and @entity49 were unconvincing at the heart of @entity9 's defence @entity107 , to be fair to him , was returning to the @entity9 team after recovering from a shoulder injury that has ruled him out of action since may 6			1
at least @entity121 , making his first start for @entity9 , offered some entertainment going forward			1
defensively he was sound , too			0
he is unfazed by the @entity9 experience and @entity30 will have no hesitation putting him into the team should @entity127 blow up			0
beyond that , this defensive experiment burned out pretty swiftly .			0

@entity7 is not a viable alternative to first - choice right back @entity23
@entity7 's poor clearance led to @entity22 's first goal
@entity9 will need to look elsewhere for full - back cover
@entity107 and @entity49 may never be ready for @entity9
@entity121 was good going forward and back on first @entity9 start
