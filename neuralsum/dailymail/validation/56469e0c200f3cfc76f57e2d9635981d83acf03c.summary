@entity21 converted from a centre - back into a defensive midfielder under former @entity1 boss @entity21 ‘ when you are as big as @entity0 you know he has the ability to get on the end of set plays			1
he also likes to break from midfield			0
‘ he has an athleticism about him and his past was playing a little bit deeper , so he is always going to be seen as that more defensive type of player			0
