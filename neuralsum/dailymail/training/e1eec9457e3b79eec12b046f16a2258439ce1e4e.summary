contact lens wearers are risking their sight by shunning opticians and buying directly over the internet , eye experts are warning			1
they might be saving themselves a few pounds , but in ‘ cutting corners ’ they are also said to be putting themselves at risk of a dangerous eye infection			1
foreign websites that sell lenses without asking to see evidence of a prescription are believed to be largely to blame for the problem			1
he said the trend towards internet purchasing had contributed to the rise , because people do not undergo ‘ vital ’ eye checks so frequently			1
these are essential for spotting early signs of infection and to make sure people know about contact lens hygiene , explained @entity38			2
he said : ‘ people will want to save money			2
so a student or a young person may try to cut corners to save money			0
they will get their eyes tested for lenses in the high street , but then get new supplies of lenses on the net			1
‘ they will decide to save money by avoiding contact lens checks			0
but these checks are vital , not just to see if the prescription needs changing , but to check eye health			1
' you are putting a foreign object in your eye , and it is important your eyes are checked to make sure your contact lenses are n’t harming your eyes			1
’ infection : student @entity65 , 21 , damaged her sight through poor contact lens care infection starts when contact lenses are exposed to the amoeba because , for example , the wearer stores them in water rather than sterile saline solution , or has worn them in the shower			0
if spotted early it can be treated with drugs , but if left untreated the infection can badly scar the eye			0
in a third of cases the cornea is so badly scarred it needs to be taken out and replaced with a donor one			1
prof @entity85 has seen a seven-fold increase in cases of the infection – officially called @entity89 – at his @entity91 clinic since 2010 , up from 11 a year to about 80			2
nationwide , the number of known cases has risen from around 100 to more than 200 a year , although @entity38 believes that is just a fraction of the true number , as many people fail to seek treatment			1
optometrist dr @entity100 , from @entity101 , said the real threat came from ordering lenses online from foreign - based websites , rather than @entity106 - based firms which required a prescription			1
he explained : ‘ once the prescription expires , you can not re-order online from a reputable @entity106 website , so you have to go back for a test			2
‘ however , there are an awful lot of foreign websites [ selling to @entity106 customers ] and these do n’t require a prescription			0
because they are based outside the @entity106 , the @entity117 is powerless to act			0
’ art student @entity65 , 21 , from @entity118 , @entity119 , developed the infection in her first year at university			0
‘ i used to do things that put you at risk like wearing throwaway daily contact lenses more than once and sleeping in them if i stayed over at a party			2
and i showered in them , but i did n’t know i was doing anything wrong , ’ she said			0
‘ i developed a sore red eye and blurry vision and after a number of weeks ended up as an inpatient at @entity91			2
my vision in one eye has been damaged			0
my other eye compensates , but it has been a shock			0
’ other risky contact lens behaviour includes licking lenses to moisten them if they fall out , swimming in them , touching them with dirty hands , reusing solution , and even making a ‘ @entity145 ’ solution from tap water and salt .			0

people are buying lenses online to avoid having to pay for a prescription

number of cornea - damaging @entity23 cases has doubled since 2010
in a third of cases a part of the eye has to be taken out and replaced
