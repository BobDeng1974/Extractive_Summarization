published : 05:07 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 05:24 est , 26 april 2012 neglected : @entity0 , seen shortly before her death in 2007 , had been a resident at the @entity3 home for just a few weeks a coroner has launched a scathing attack on a care home after an emaciated pensioner was admitted to hospital weighing less than five - and - a - half stone			1
just five weeks before , ' sprightly ' 94 - year - old @entity0 had walked into a privately - run care home in good physical health			1
but she deteriorated to such an extent at the @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , that she was taken out on a stretcher and died shortly after			1
when she was admitted to hospital as an emergency case her family claimed she resembled a ' concentration camp victim '			0
staff nurses were shocked to find the widowed mother - of - six had a chest infection , pneumonia , pressure sores , septicaemia and ear and urinary infections			1
@entity29 thought she would not make it through the night but she survived for another two and a half weeks			2
@entity32 coroner @entity31 yesterday said : ' i find it very alarming that such a vulnerable person who relied on professionals for her care and support was presented to hospital in the way she was			2
' the vulnerable in our society must be properly cared for on all levels and their dignity protected			0
i think that mrs @entity0 was not afforded the care and dignity she deserved on this occasion			1
' nurse @entity49 who received mrs @entity0 on a general medical ward at @entity51 said : ' it was quite upsetting			1
she was really , really frail			0
there were some issues we were really concerned about			0
' when i was changing her bedding with another nurse we were all quite upset and distressed			0
her right ear was impacted with ear wax and she had a pressure sore , her hair was thin and wispy and badly stuck to her face and neck and her eyes were completely shut			0
it took quite a lot of bathing with water to open them			0
' when old people ’s matron @entity71 saw mrs @entity0 she immediately contacted social services			1
@entity75 specialist dr @entity74 , who examined mrs @entity0 , reported : ' she appeared neglected and unkempt , there was a discharge from both eyes , a smell of urine and she was distressed			1
she was covered in faeces when she first arrived			0
' deterioration : @entity83 , 72 , at his mother 's bedside in 2007			1
the retired miner said mrs @entity0 was ' sprightly ' when she entered the home the doctor wrote later : ' i got the impression she was neglected			1
she was weak and thin and it could not be explained			0
' tissue viability nurse @entity92 , who carried out an investigation after mrs @entity0 ’s death , said there were no notes about her pressure sores yet @entity0 was at ' high risk ' of skin damage			1
' i believe there had been neglect by omission , ' she said			1
' this is in the absence of any proof that there was any intervention			0
' the @entity32 hearing was told mrs @entity0 had a lower than normal body mass index and had been assessed at risk of malnutrition four months before she went into the home			1
her son @entity83 , 72 , a retired miner , told the inquest his mother was ' sprightly ' when she was at home in @entity118 , near @entity32			2
' her carers used to say my mum could get up the stairs better than they could , ' he said			0
but the great - grandmother developed dementia and needed 24 - hour care so her family decided to put her in the @entity3			2
she went into the home on july 6 , 2007			2
failings : an inquiry found the widowed mother of six suffered unintentional abuse through ' neglect by omission ' mr @entity83 said : ' they kept saying they were feeding her and i had no reason not to believe it but it turned out it was wrong			1
the nurse at the hospital said she had never seen anybody come into hospital from a care home in such a bad state			1
' the former care home manager @entity146 said in a statement that staff helped mrs @entity0 with her personal hygiene and toileting , but her diet was poor and she would often refuse to eat			1
care assistant @entity152 told the inquest the elderly patient had mobility problems and she was refusing food and fluids			2
she regularly washed her , bathed her eyes and put cream on her sores			2
@entity162 dr @entity161 said mrs @entity0 died on august 29 , 2007 , from broncho - pneumonia contributed to by coronary artery atheroma			1
she said her reduced mobility could have played a part in increasing the risk of pneumonia and there was also evidence of malnourishment			0
the 44 - bed @entity3 was run by the @entity172 at the time of mrs @entity0 's death but last year it was sold to new owners mha			1
an inquiry by @entity179 ’s social services department found the previous owners negligent by ' omission of care ' for @entity183 in february , 2008			1
@entity184 , area manager of the @entity3 at the time , denied mrs @entity0 was emaciated			2
in a letter to the family read at the inquest she said : ' the references to a concentration camp victim are unjustified			0
' she said staff claimed to wash or bathe mrs @entity0 on a daily basis and they regularly brushed her hair			2
the widow had a poor appetite and would refuse food , she said			0
she admitted the old woman had sores on her heels , right hip and lower spine when admitted to hospital and that she should have been referred to a dietician			0
@entity204 , @entity179 ’s safeguarding service manager said an inquiry found mrs @entity0 had suffered abuse through ' neglect by omission ' but it was not intentional			1
' it was based on poor recording , little or no evidence in respect of the care she was receiving , there were no weight charts , fluid or diet recordings and there was no evidence of professional visits			0
' @entity222 , service manager for the current owners of the @entity3 said all the staff were now fully trained and there was regular auditing of residents ’ hygiene , nutrition and medication needs			0
cause for concern : the @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , has been taken over since mrs @entity0 's death , but former operator @entity172 still runs other homes recording a narrative verdict the coroner said : ' her basic care and medical requirements were not satisfactorily met and her decreased mobility during her time at the @entity3 increased her risk of developing a chest infection			1
' ms @entity31 went on : ' her nutritional status compromised her ability to cope with the effects of the chest infection , the latter of which led to her death			0
' after the hearing , mrs @entity0 's granddaughter @entity248 , 56 , said : ' the coroner confirmed everything we knew as a family			2
@entity254 did contribute to her death			0
the care she was provided with in that place was absolutely disgusting			0
' mrs @entity0 ’s son @entity258 , 68 , said : ' her life was shortened by this			2
there was a total lack of care			0
she hardly saw a doctor in 40 years before she went into that home			0
she did all her own shopping and was very active for her age			0
' the coroner is also writing to @entity172 , which still operates other care homes , asking them if they have reviewed all their procedures , documentation and training following mrs @entity0 's death .			1

@entity0 , 94 , was suffering from pneumonia , sores and infections after just a few weeks in a privately - run care home in @entity15
previous inquiry into her death in 2007 found the mother of six had suffered abuse through ' neglect by omission '
