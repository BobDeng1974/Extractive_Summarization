@entity0 believes @entity1 will need another 23 points to reach the @entity3 as he insisted sentiment will have no bearing on when he recalls @entity6			1
@entity1 ’s influential captain is fit again after recovering from a hamstring problem he sustained on february 10 but there is no guarantee that @entity0 will put him straight back into the starting line - up , as would have been the case during the majority of his career at @entity15			1
during @entity6 ’s absence , @entity1 won three consecutive @entity18 games against @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 but @entity0 feels that sequence is going to have to continue in what will be a pivotal week for the club , with tonight ’s trip to @entity26 followed by next sunday ’s showdown with @entity28			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 ( right ) says his team will need 23 points out of their last 30 available @entity0 shares a laugh with @entity33 defender @entity32 ( left ) during the session @entity35 works on his fitness and conditioning with @entity1 coach @entity38 ( left ) @entity1 pair @entity39 ( left ) and @entity40 strike a pose during the training esssion @entity6 wants to help @entity1 finish in the top four and win the @entity45 before he joins @entity46 and while @entity0 is adamant the 34 - year - old will have a say on how the campaign maps out , he wo n’t pick him on reputation alone			1
‘ we have 30 points to play for , so i am guessing it will be another 23 points , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ that is how competitive it has been this year			2
' we have won nine out of 11 in january and february , it has been a great run but now we have to be focused on these last 10 matches			0
' we have to be aggressive in our game and now we have to nail it in the last 10			0
i know the players are focused on that			0
‘ everyone is waiting to see if @entity66 comes into the team or not , but it was the same with @entity69			0
does he or does he not ? what you have seen over my time here is that i rely on the team			2
' the team , of course , has to have good players in it , but ultimately it is about the team and what is going to benefit and how we can get results as a team			2
' i will repeat again the most important thing is @entity6 is back fit and we have @entity84 coming back too			1
‘ that will add to the competition for places and with one game a week , barring the @entity45 game , then everyone is going to be fighting and being competitive about playing			0
‘ the beauty of this season is that everyone has had an opportunity in the first three or four months of the season and then we have found a way to win			0
it is something everyone has to respect			0
it is about the team and the spirit of the team and i will always pick the best team i feel to win a game			0
’ @entity1 captain @entity6 is back in contention for the trip to @entity26 after an injury layoff @entity109 central defender @entity35 jumps to power a header in during the session at @entity112 vice captain @entity113 in action alongside @entity35 ( right ) during a training drill captain @entity6 trains ahead of team - mates @entity117 ( left ) and right back @entity119 ( centre ) @entity0 added : ‘ he still has big qualities that we will need between now and the end of the season ( but ) i do n’t pick a team on whether i like someone or not			1
what i do know is that @entity66 always puts the team first			0
’ @entity129 ’s future , meanwhile , continues to create background noise but @entity0 maintains the decision to put contract talks on hold until the end of the campaign has nothing to do with finance			1
‘ i still think he has a lot of development to go and this is the best place for him , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ it is pretty obvious that this is a great place for him to be and he has said that himself			0
’ @entity1 midfielder @entity143 ( left ) vies for possession with left back @entity145 @entity1 striker @entity146 strikes one on the volley with his left foot during training @entity152 @entity151 goalkeeper @entity150 gets down low to his right to stop the ball with his hand @entity1 left back @entity156 all smiles during saturday 's session at @entity112 video every game counts for @entity0			1
