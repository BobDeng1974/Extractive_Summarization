@entity0 is tied second in leaderboard after good start @entity4 @entity3 is setting the pace in @entity6 @entity7 struggled on the back end of the course @entity10 reckoned it was 21 years since the last time he was asked to strike the opening drive in an event as prestigious as the @entity14			1
‘ there were about eight people gathered around the first tee and i think i knew them all by their @entity19 name , ’ he said			2
‘ there were no shadows creeping up over the tee as the sun came up , no phones going off , and no rattling of change in pockets			2
’ good start : @entity10 is tied second on the early leaderboard last week at @entity29 he played with @entity30 and @entity31			1
this time , rather bizarrely given he is a former world no 1 , he was in the sunrise slot usually the preserve of journeymen			0
but if that was a blow to the ego there were plenty of compensatory factors , with no wind and unblemished greens to add to his own aforementioned list			0
‘ it was like being a golfer with a handicap again , given it was probably worth a shot , ’ he said			0
the 41 - year - old @entity0 , who returned to the winner ’s circle at the @entity49 two weeks ago , took full advantage with a five - under - par 67 that left him tied second on the early leaderboard headed by @entity4 @entity3 on seven under			1
prize guy : @entity10 ended his drought at the @entity55 a fortnight ago setting the pace : @entity3 is the early leader in @entity6 no @entity57 has won in @entity4 so far this season , so it was encouraging to see the opening salvo of @entity10 ( right ) backed up by @entity61 champion @entity60 and @entity63 @entity62 and @entity64 , who all returned 67s , while @entity67 shot 69			1
this was a heartening start from @entity60 given his modest record here , with no top 20 finishes in 10 previous appearances			2
this time he adopted a more cautious approach from the tee and was delighted to see it pay off			0
@entity60 was in the same group as @entity7 , and if ever an opening 70 could be considered disappointing this was it			1
@entity7 began at the 10th and by the time he reached the turn he had the ball on a veritable piece of string			1
so good were his approach shots he birdied the 18th , first and second holes with putts of a combined length of just six feet three inches			2
poor finish : @entity7 struggled at the back end of the course five under and cruising , the idea that he would go on to drop three shots over the next seven holes seemed preposterous , but it has been that sort of nearly - but - not - quite season for the @entity98 to date			1
‘ a pretty average and frustrating round , given the position i was in , ’ he admitted			0
it was here last year that @entity64 had his fall - out with @entity103 , admitting the pair were sworn enemies			0
focused : @entity64 refused to be drawn on his spat with @entity103 two weeks later he made his racist - tinged remark at @entity108 that almost cost him his lucrative equipment contract and caused a storm of protest			0
no @entity112 to worry about this year because of injury — @entity103 demolished him in the third round — and @entity64 was quick to shoot down @entity4 attempts to revisit the incident			1
‘ it ’s in the past so let ’s leave it there and look forward to hopefully what ’s coming over the next three days , ’ he said .			0
