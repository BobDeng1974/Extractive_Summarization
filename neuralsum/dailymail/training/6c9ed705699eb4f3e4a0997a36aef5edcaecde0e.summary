by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 08:55 est , 28 november 2013 a woman who has spent the month growing a moustache has been so pleased with people 's reactions that she 's considering keeping it			1
@entity6 was once dubbed ' @entity7 ' due to having an excess of facial hair as a result of suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome ( @entity12 )			1
one of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones ( androgens ) , which leads to hair growth , meaning she would spend hours shaving and waxing her face			2
she decided to grow a moustache for @entity26 to highlight the problem and raise awareness but miss @entity6 , 29 , decided to ditch the razor at the start of the month and embrace her moustache for @entity26 , and raise awareness of her condition			1
she said : ' it was a spur of the moment decision after coming home from work feeling very embarrassed about how my facial hair had come through			0
' while she would usually be clean - shaven and use tweezers to remove stray hairs , she has n't touched her facial hair for 30 days			1
miss @entity6 , from @entity44 , said : ' i decided that it 's part of me , so why should i hide it to please other people ? ' i wanted people to know that i 'm not lazy or unclean , it 's just a medical condition			1
' @entity53 ovarian syndrome is the main cause of excess hair in women			1
it 's estimated to affect 10 to 15 per cent of women and is when the ovaries do n’t work properly and are covered in small cysts			1
as a result , eggs are released erratically or not at all , causing irregular or missed periods , and often reduced fertility and acne			0
one of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones ( androgens ) , which leads to hair growth			0
comfortable : miss @entity6 , with her fiance @entity71 , said : ' i felt really self - conscious at first , but when i told people my facial hair was due to a medical condition , they understood and were actually really supportive ' miss @entity6 , who works for a kitchen and beds company , was diagnosed with @entity12 in 2006 , after she started suffering with other symptoms , such as such weight gain and irregular periods			1
as @entity26 loomed closer this year , she decided it was time to banish the myth that only men grow moustaches and take part in the charity event			1
the fundraising challenge is usually reserved for men and sees people being sponsored to grow their facial hair for prostate cancer and men 's mental health			1
miss @entity6 said : ' i felt really self conscious at first but i found that if i told people who started staring at me why i was doing it and that it was due to a medical condition , they understood and were actually really supportive			1
' the hair has been really itchy and prickly but now it 's come through more i 'm getting used to it			1
' she is now considering keeping the moustache after her confidence grew			2
she added : ' i have had so much more confidence towards the second half of the month			0
support : miss @entity6 says she has been ' overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers ' who have donated to her cause , and thanked her for bringing the condition to light ' i feel a lot more comfortable in my own skin			1
i 'm not sure what to do now			0
it has brought me a lot of happiness having this on my face and being able to tell people about it , and i do n't want to undo any good work			0
' i might keep it because it 's part of who i am and it 's ok to be me			0
the only downside is i look like my brother			0
' ' i moved jobs at the start of the month and told my manager straight away , and everyone at work has been right behind me			0
' she has currently raised around £ 800 over the month , and she is planning on donating the cash to men 's charities			0
' it 's raising the profile of the condition and getting the issue out there , ' she said			2
' my money is still going towards the men 's charities - i 've just taken part in it			2
' she said she has been ' overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers ' who have donated to her cause , and thanked her for bringing the condition to light			0
' it 's something you have to deal with and people have felt ashamed , as i did in the past , but i think i have brought it to the fore , ' she said			2
' people have experienced shame but i 've highlighted that it 's a medical condition , and most people have understood			1
' i have been amazed with how generous people have been and i 'm really thankful to everyone who has donated money for such a good cause			2
' she added that her fiancee @entity71 had been a great source of support			0
' @entity71 has been my rock , and i could n't have done it without her			0
' she 's encouraged me all along the way - she told me to go for it and she 's been fantastic in keeping me going throughout the month			1

@entity12 is the main cause of excess hair in women			1
it 's estimated to affect 10 to 15 percent of women and is when the ovaries do n’t work properly and are covered in small cysts			2
as a result , eggs are released erratically or not at all , causing irregular or missed periods , and often reduced fertility and acne			0
one of the most common symptoms is a high level of male hormones ( androgens ) , which leads to hair growth			0
however , sometimes women produce higher levels , or they may have normal levels , but their hair follicles are more sensitive to androgens			2
' if excess hair is due to a hormonal imbalance , then it tends to occur in areas such as the chin , upper lip , sideburns , chest and inner thighs , ' says dr @entity207 , an endocrinologist from @entity208 , @entity209 , with a special interest in excess hair			1
' these are areas of the skin that are more sensitive to testosterone			0
the hair is also likely to be coarse and dark			0
' given the implications for fertility , women worried about excess hair should see their gp , advises @entity221 , professor of reproductive endocrinology at @entity222 , @entity209 and an endocrinologist at @entity224 ’s and @entity225 , @entity209			1
' there may be other problems to investigate , ' he suggests			0
' often , excess hair is a symptom of @entity12 , but it also can be indicative of less common , but potentially more serious , hormonal disorders , or tumours of the ovary or adrenal gland - the two parts of the body that produce testosterone			1
' women should not be afraid to ask for a referral to a specialist			0
' the alarm bells should ring for a gp if a woman comes in with a growth of facial hair that has developed within the past six months , he adds .			0
