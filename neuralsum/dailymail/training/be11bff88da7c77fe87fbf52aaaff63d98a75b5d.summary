by @entity1 reporter the weather kills at least 2,000 @entity3 each year and nearly two - thirds of the deaths are from the cold , according to a new government report			1
that may surprise some people , the researchers acknowledged			0
hurricanes , tornadoes and heat waves ' get more publicity , for some reason , than cold - related deaths , ' said @entity16 , one of the report 's authors			2
the report released wednesday by the @entity20 analyzed @entity3 deaths attributed to the cold , the heat , storms , floods and lightning			1
the weather kills at least 2,000 @entity3 each year and nearly two - thirds of the deaths are from the cold , according to a new government report it used national death certificate information for five years			1
the report found : - of the 10,649 deaths attributed to the weather , about 63 per cent were tied to exposure to the cold or hypothermia			1
those who more often fall victim to the cold include the homeless , alcoholics , those who take part in wilderness activities and winter sports , and fragile people already fighting illnesses who live in under - heated homes			1
- about 31 per cent of the deaths were caused by heat , heat stroke or sun stroke			2
the remaining 6 percent were blamed on storms , floods or lightning			2
over five years , 63 per cent of the 10,649 deaths attributed to the weather were tied to exposure to the cold or hypothermia - more than two - thirds of weather - related deaths were men and boys , and men were twice as likely as women to die from storms , floods or lightning strikes			1
and people 65 and older had much higher death rates than younger people , perhaps because it 's harder for them to endure temperature extremes , the researchers said			0
- the highest heat - related death rates were in cities and very rural areas ; the most isolated areas also had the highest rates related to the cold and to storms , floods and lightning			2
low - income counties had higher weather - related death rates than high - income counties			0
that could be due to people in poor rural or urban places lacking heating , air conditioning or help during blizzards or heat waves , the researchers said			0
cold victims include the homeless , alcoholics , those who take part in wilderness activities and winter sports , and fragile people already fighting illnesses who live in under - heated homes - for blacks , the heat - related death rate was about 2.5 times higher than the rate for whites , and about twice as high as the @entity108 rate			1
@entity109 also died at a higher rate from the cold			0
that finding may be tied to higher concentrations of low - income blacks in large cities or very rural areas			0
also , blacks might be more vulnerable to weather extremes because they have more heart disease and other chronic health problems			0
@entity121 , however , died at twice the rate of blacks from floods , storms and lightning strikes .			0
