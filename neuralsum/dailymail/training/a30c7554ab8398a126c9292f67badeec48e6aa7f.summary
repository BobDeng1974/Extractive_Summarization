despite @entity2 being considered a culinary melting pot , the average @entity1 can only cook four foreign dishes - @entity5 , curry , stir fry and risotto , a study revealed and we are woefully lacking in global gastronomic knowledge , with more than half unsure of what a falafel is			1
the findings also showed that there is a staggering Â£ 240 million worth of unused herbs and spices going to waste in the kitchen cupboard - with 13 per cent of the nation hoarding spices that are more than four years old			1
exotic ingredients including ras el hanout ( @entity40 spice mix ) , star anise and marjoram are the three @entity1 cooks use the least			0
the research by @entity45 suggests our reluctance to experiment with more adventurous dishes is to blame			0

thyme ( 17 % ) astonishingly , the research revealed 60 per cent do n't know that gazpacho comes from @entity12 , and 30 per cent are not sure what a falafel is , with seven per cent confusing it with baklava , a rich , sweet pastry made of layers of filo , chopped nuts and honey , and a further seven per cent believing it is an unleavened flatbread			1
from left to right : @entity60 , chilli and oregano are the herbs and spices used the most in @entity2 kitchens it also found 17 per cent ( one in six ) can cook no more than one international dish and more than a quarter ( 27 per cent ) use ready - made sauces rather than starting from scratch			1
meanwhile , 25 per cent admit they have to rely on takeaways or restaurants to get their foreign food fix			0
two thirds ( 62 per cent ) have cooked an @entity96 curry at home , yet just one in seven ( 15 per cent ) have added turmeric to their dishes , 10 per cent have experimented with mustard seeds and a mere two per cent tried cooking with cardamom			1
food historian @entity102 said : ' the @entity2 palate has continually embraced new flavours and cuisines through the ages			0
lacking in knowledge : 60 % of @entity108 are unaware that gazpacho ( left ) comes from @entity12 more than a quarter ( 30 % ) are unsure of what a falafel ( right ) is , with 7 % believing its a sweet dessert rather than a savoury snack ' but perhaps we are more open to tasting and experiencing ' new ' dishes than cooking them			1
' in the home kitchen , when a family needs to be fed , it can be easy to stick to a repertoire of tried and tested recipes			1
' @entity123 , kenwood trade marketing manager , added : ' we were staggered how many millions of pounds worth of herbs and spices are going to waste			0
' we know @entity108 continually embrace new flavours and cuisines , but it seems we 're not confident enough to experiment with them in our own homes			0
' the company has teamed up with six chefs , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 to create downloadable e-booklet @entity140 in 80 plates , designed to encourage home cooks to try creating exotic dishes from scratch .			0
