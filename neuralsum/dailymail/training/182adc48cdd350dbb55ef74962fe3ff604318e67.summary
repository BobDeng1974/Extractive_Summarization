nearly two years since her unimaginable loss , @entity8 has written a piece for @entity11 about how suicidal thoughts and a dark depression gave way to feelings of hope and understanding thanks to friends who took her in and life - changing charity work at an orphanage in @entity21			1
she has now returned to work in @entity22 and is looking forward to getting married next year to a long - time friend , who appeared by her hospital bed the day of the tragedy in 2011			1

' fighter : @entity8 , who lost her three daughters and parents to a @entity6 house fire on christmas day , 2011 , beams with happiness as she is pictured with her fiance , @entity35 at first , @entity8 , 49 , could never have imagined feeling such peace			1

they were joined by her boyfriend of a month , @entity47 , who was the contractor on the @entity50 home			0
but that night , unfathomable tragedy struck			0
she woke at 3am to a room filled with smoke and although she desperately tried to save her daughters , only she and @entity47 survived			2
authorities have said the home caught fire due to still - glowing fireplace embers that had been put in a mud room			1
@entity8 has expressed skepticism over this conclusion , insisting that she saw electrical sparks coming from the house as she clambered over scaffolding to reach her girls			1
loss : nine - year - old @entity39 , left , poses with her seven - year - old twin sisters , @entity41 ( center ) and @entity42 ( right ) missed : @entity8 's parents , @entity69 and @entity70 , also lost their lives in the early - morning fire she still replays the surreal evening over and over in her head , she wrote in @entity11			1
' even today , i wake up most morning and i 'm back there trying to figure out how to save everybody , or thinking about what i could have done differently , ' she said			2
' why did n't i climb into bed with my kids ? why did n't i check on them in the night ? why did n't i smell the smoke ? why did i choose that house ? ' after learning in hospital that her daughters and parents had all died in the fire , the next thing she remembers is waking up surrounded by friends , including now - fiance @entity35			1
just days later , she managed to attend the funeral of her children , sobbing alongside her ex-husband and the father of her girls , @entity95			2
but just two days afterwards , with no funeral to organize or focus on , she plunged into a deep depression and broke down , threatening to take a bottle of pills , she recalled			1
scene : the destroyed house in @entity50 was immediately pulled down by the city survivors : only @entity8 and her boyfriend of a month , contractor @entity47 , survived the fire			1
they are pictured at the children 's funeral but @entity8 said their relationship had no hope devastated : @entity8 cries on the shoulder of her ex-husband , @entity95 , at the funeral she was committed to a psychiatric hospital in @entity22 and was not allowed to check herself out			1
there , her story made therapists cry and she watched as patients went for electric shock therapy			2
eventually she was moved to a trauma - therapy center outside @entity122 ' by which time my hair was coming out in clumps , ' she said			2
' i do n't remember eating			0
at times i was manic ; at other times , almost catatonically depressed			0
' desperate to escape , in february 2013 she called her old college roommate , @entity130 , in @entity131 , @entity132 and asked to stay with her			2
@entity130 and her husband agreed - as long as she promised not to kill herself			2
' i was lying through my teeth , ' she said			0
' at that point i was far closer to killing myself than i was at any other point during the tragedy - i felt sure it was my only option			0
' but with her move to @entity132 , bit by bit , she began to feel some normalcy			1
she began daily therapy sessions , took up yoga and had acupuncture treatments			0
she also began helping out a friend of @entity130 's with her estate sales business , sorting through antiques and old family belongings			2
ripped apart : the girls are pictured with their father @entity95 , who was also invited to the house in @entity6 for @entity4 but stayed in @entity154 instead			0
he has set up a fund in the girls ' names carrying on : @entity8 said she feels the children 's memories would best be honored by continuing to live she credits the work with saving her life - not only because it focused her energies , but also because looking at old photos of people who had long since passed helped her face the idea of loss			1
' @entity168 , i was getting my brain back online , ' she said			0
realizing that she was craving the type of work more suited to her - working for advertizing firm @entity172 in @entity22 - she decided to move back			1
but before that , she had to face @entity4 again			0
she decided to go to an orphanage in @entity21 and on christmas day , she gave the children toys that had previously belonged to her own daughters			1
' i closed my eyes and when i opened them we were all crying , ' she said			0
' when i looked into the girls ' faces , i saw my children			0
it broke me open in a way i still ca n't fully explain			0
' but if these little girls were living their lives with joy and happiness , i realized - and if they could give their love to me after all they had been through - how could i possibly feel sorry for myself ? ' she returned to work in @entity22 and said the job had given her a ' deep comfort '			1
staying strong : she has returned to work in @entity22 and plans to get married next september on moving back to the city , she contacted @entity197 , who lives and works as a real estate broker in @entity199 , for help finding a new place to live			1
