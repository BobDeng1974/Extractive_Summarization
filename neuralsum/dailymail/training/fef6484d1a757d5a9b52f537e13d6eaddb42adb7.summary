they may have been beaten twice here by @entity2 already to add to five defeats before @entity4 against @entity5 but , whisper it , @entity0 may just be putting together a one - day team that could exceed expectations at the @entity9			1
it would still take a giant leap of faith to consider @entity0 as realistic contenders but against all previous evidence – and their long run of almost unmitigated 50 - over disaster – things just might be alright on the night			1
certainly @entity0 seem to have stumbled on their best line - up in the nick of time - as they did ahead of winning the @entity19 in 2010 - to at least confound the most pessimistic predictions of another dismal @entity9 failure			1
@entity22 has looked impressive since taking over as one - day captain of the @entity0 side coach @entity25 , left , believes @entity0 's @entity27 form proves they can compete at the @entity9 click here to read @entity30 's report on @entity0 's defeat by @entity2 on friday			1
the 11 players who should have got over a psychological hurdle and defeated @entity2 in @entity34 on friday will almost certainly be the team that takes on a much stronger host nation in the opening @entity9 match in @entity38			1
and if they keep on showing the improvement which has seen outstanding contributions from @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and new captain @entity22 here then they may just be able to go beyond the last eight			1
@entity0 coach @entity25 was in bullish when @entity0 made the long journey to @entity49 ahead of another date with @entity51 at the @entity52 on friday and a potential tri-series final against @entity2 here next sunday			1
‘ the goal here was to try to settle quickly on our side for the @entity9 and it feels as though we ’re doing that now , ’ said @entity25			1
‘ it ’s a squad with options and the good thing is we have three or four out of the side fighting to get in it			2
‘ we desperately want to get to the @entity27 final and we ’ve got a big game on friday			1
if we get there we feel if we play at the top of our game it will be a really good contest			2
@entity2 are a good side , there ’s no doubt , but so are we and we ’re starting to show that			1
we can feel ourselves moving in the right direction			2
@entity42 , who has had a difficult past two years , has been in excellent form while in @entity2 @entity22 chats to bowler @entity42 before he begins an over against @entity51 at @entity77 ‘ anybody who watched the game in @entity34 saw an @entity0 side score 300 and then say ‘ crikey we really should have got more			1
’ similarly i think our bowling will only get better			2
@entity83 and @entity44 are coming back from injury and it ’s still early on for them			0
‘ it must be said that the big decisions @entity0 made ahead of this tour have been vindicated already even if only one @entity27 game in three has been won			1
the sacking of @entity91 may have come late in their grand @entity9 plan but @entity22 is looking an impressive leader who has even been able to take an attempt to blackmail him over his sex life pretty much in his stride			0
and the jettisoning of @entity91 has allowed @entity41 to emerge from the shadows to justify @entity0 ’s decision to prefer him at the top of the order ahead of @entity102 in spectacular fashion , batting as well at the @entity104 in scoring 141 as he can ever have done in limited - overs cricket			1
most promisingly , @entity42 is starting to again look like the one - day bowler who was almost unplayable in @entity107 two years ago having battled back from a collapse in his action during last year ’s traumatic @entity111 tour so severe that his international and even county future was in doubt			2
‘ the whole dressing room and everybody associated with it were really pleased with @entity119 ’s performance at the @entity77 , ’ said @entity25 of @entity42 ’s five - wicket haul against @entity51			1
‘ he has had a tough time and has worked hard to get back			0
i was equally pleased last night because backing that up is difficult			0
@entity41 has been excellent since being given the nod over @entity102 at the top of the order @entity41 celebrates after reaching his century , he eventually scored 141 at the @entity104 against @entity2 ‘ he came on at a tough time to bowl and he ran in , got the ball reversing and picked up a couple of wickets			1
he had that bounce back in how he did everything			0
i think it ’s fantastic			0
he ’s a very good performer , we know he ’s got a great record and credit to someone who ’s put in a lot of hard work			0
‘ it would be a huge boost for us if he gets back to where he was a couple of years ago			0
@entity42 ’s gone through quite a journey and he ’s got to the point where he just wants to go and enjoy his cricket			2
he ’s in a good place			0
’ when @entity0 lost one - day series to both @entity5 and @entity51 last summer and then got thrashed in @entity5 they looked a million miles from a side capable of the modern , dynamic one - day cricket other nations are playing			1
now , three weeks from the @entity9 , it is possible to start to get ever so slightly optimistic			0
‘ i said when i took over that it was our job to try to get the best 15 players on the plane for the @entity9 , ’ said @entity25			2
‘ @entity91 did n’t get on that plane and everybody felt for him but it just felt like the right time to do it			0
without a shadow of doubt there ’s still time for us to compete with the best sides at this @entity9			0
you do n’t get more than 300 in three out of five games here so far without playing well			0
‘ there ’s lots of things going round in our team and i think they ’re starting to fit together			0
we want to keep it simple , get a settled side and enjoy playing			0
we ’re representing our country , i think we ’ve got the best 15 players we could and now we need to get stuck in and work hard to win some games			0
’ @entity25 felt it was the ' right time ' to drop former captain @entity91			2
