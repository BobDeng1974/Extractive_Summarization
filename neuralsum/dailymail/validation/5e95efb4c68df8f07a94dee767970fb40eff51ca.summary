shamed payday lenders are still hounding vulnerable customers suffering from illness and bereavement despite pressure to clean up the industry , a report has found			1
only one year after a new regulator was tasked with keeping loan companies in check , many are still employing bully boy tactics when a customer defaults on their repayments			1
the @entity14 found that certain firms continued to be ' unsympathetic and inflexible ' where a customer was in ' distress and financial difficulty '			1
the watchdog said one lender had even tried to extract money from customers by ' threatening visits to their home or place of work ' , despite having no policy to do so			1
hounded : a year after the @entity14 was tasked with regulating payday lenders , its report finds the firms are still hounding vulnerable customers ( file photo ) others threatened to pass on customers ' accounts to external debt collectors , even though they had no intention of doing so			1
the @entity14 said it uncovered ' misleading and occasionally threatening correspondence from lenders ' , despite an attempt to clamp down on such behaviour			1
@entity44 , at comparison site @entity46 , said last night : ' it 's shocking that vulnerable people are still being hounded , even when they 're taking steps to get their debts under control			0
' it 's clear that more needs to be done to protect those trapped in a vicious circle of debt			0
' there is a need for short term credit , but payday loans can be a very expensive way to borrow money			2
we need high street banks to step up and offer robust short term lending solutions			2
' last april , the @entity14 was put in charge of regulating the payday industry in an attempt to tackle the number of people spiralling into unmanageable debt through these high - interest short - term loans			1
but the @entity14 's own report found evidence that high - risk applicants were still being accepted for loans , even where lenders had ' grounds to suspect that customers were at risk of , or already in , financial difficulties '			1
they said shambolic record - keeping meant calls and emails from customers admitting they were in difficulty and could not pay often ' fell through gaps ' in the system			2
in some cases , companies had a backlog of correspondence from debt advice charities stretching back several weeks , meaning lenders were completely unaware of why customers had defaulted on their loan			2
this included medical evidence which would have explained why someone had stopped repaying their debt			0
vulnerable : the @entity14 's own report found evidence that high - risk applicants were still being accepted for loans ' in many cases , these customers were still being chased for their debts through daily letters , emails and phone calls ' , the @entity14 said			1
even lenders which had logged details of customers ' personal circumstances , including illness or bereavement , sometimes failed to tell debt collectors this			1
some firms were also short - staffed and inadequately trained to deal with complex arrears cases , it added			1
however , it said some positive changes and been made and that most firms had significantly reduced the amount of fees and interest they charged customers who had fallen behind with their repayments			2
@entity133 , at the @entity132 charity , said payday lenders must ' drastically improve the way they treat customers in financial difficulty '			0
she said : ' while the improvements already being made by firms are welcome , the @entity14 has been very clear that many are struggling with the pace of change required to bring them up to scratch			2

the ombudsman has seen a 64 per cent increase in payday lending complaints since 2012 and it is currently taking on more than 70 new cases each month			0
it is finding in consumers ' favour in around two - thirds of cases			0
the main complaint it deals with is a loan provider being unwilling to accept a suitable repayment plan , as well as poor administration and customer service			0
@entity166 , of @entity167 , said : ' some of the worst debt collection practices people tell us about come from payday lenders			0
' people have sought our help after their lender told colleagues about their debts or pretended that they were bailiffs and threatened to seize belongings from their home			0
' important progress has been made since tougher @entity14 rules came in but many people are still falling foul of irresponsible lending			0
