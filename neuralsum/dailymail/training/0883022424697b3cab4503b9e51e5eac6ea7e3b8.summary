@entity1 workers have been caught on video allegedly feeding foxes offal and eggs in a bid to boost the population			2
members of the @entity8 in @entity9 were allegedly filmed dumping dozens of dead chickens , eggs and rats into a rural valley in a bid to ' fatten up ' animals before hunting			1
after feeding the animals over several weeks , the men allegedly coaxed them out from setts and released the hounds on them			1
@entity47 over a number of weeks , the video shows the animals thriving on a high protein diet before being drawn out and prevented from returning , activists claim			0
hounds are then released , with the foxes allegedly unable to hide in badger setts which campaigners say have been blocked			2
under the @entity29 it is not illegal to encourage hounds to hunt foxes , however driving foxes to a hunt area with intent to pursue them is a breach of the law			1
' somebody would be doing this purely to encourage foxes to breed , to stay here so that they can obviously be in the vicinity of when the hunt choose to hunt , ' a spokesman for @entity64 in @entity9 said			2
various vehicles were followed from the site in @entity9 to the hunt 's kennels upon review of the film a pile of dead animals and eggs was filmed at the site where foxes were thriving on the high - protein diet a variety of people , allegedly members of the @entity8 , visited the site over a number of weeks ' if they have a food source they do n’t need to travel and they do n’t need to go anywhere else			1
it would go against their own guidelines			0
' the hunt can be seen feeding foxes near an artificial earth in order to maintain a steady supply of foxes in a particular location			0
' this location is a popular meet of theirs and the footage shows them actively hunting their hounds in that precise spot			0
' members of the hunt can also be seen blocking up a disused badger sett that is used by foxes in order to stop the fox being able to seek refuse when being chased by hounds			2
' a fox can then clearly be seen running past the blocked sett closely pursued by hounds who are being encouraged to chase it by hunt supporters			0
' some of these acts , such as encouraging hounds to chase the fox , are illegal in their own right			0
' others , such as the feeding of foxes , while not illegal in themselves show an intent by the hunt to encourage foxes to an area where they like to hunt			1
' presumably this can only be because they wish to hunt these foxes in direct contravention of the @entity29			2
' ' the hunt denies taking part in any illegal activity , dismissing critics ' claims as ' confused and vexatious '			0
the hunt is accused of breaching the @entity29 , but denies all allegations saying no members have ever acted outside of the law people at the site were seen filling up setts in an alleged bid to prevent the foxes from hiding once the hounds were released the foxes began to thrive on the high - protein diet at the fox earth in @entity9 over the weeks of filming at the end of the video , the hounds are released and begin hunting the foxes			1
@entity8 deny partaking in any illegal activity ' @entity157 have been hunting within the law since the @entity29 came into force in 2005 and no one connected to the hunt has ever been charged with , let alone convicted of , a @entity29 offence			1
' the hunt denies all the allegations made by animal rights activists , which are confused and vexatious			0
' evidence of hunts feeding foxes and creating artificial earths first emerged around 15 years ago when anti-hunt campaigners found men from the @entity171 feeding fox cubs near their @entity174 base in south @entity9			1
the evidence helped to undermine the case that fox hunting was needed as pest control .			0
