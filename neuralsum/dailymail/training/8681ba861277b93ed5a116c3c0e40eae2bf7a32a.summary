by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 8 february 2013 a mother who won £ 95,000 on @entity2 has been charged with benefit fraud			1
@entity4 , 40 , allegedly failed to tell authorities about her win on the television gameshow and continued to claim £ 5,000 in state handouts			1
by law , benefit claimants must tell the @entity11 if , through windfall or inheritance , they come into enough money to push their bank balance over £ 16,000			2
she has offered to repay the money , but council officials have continued with the prosecution regardless			2
@entity18 won the cash on the @entity23 programme just over a year ago , telling viewers she would use her good fortune to buy her own home and help her family in @entity38			1
after her win , the mother of two , from @entity40 , hugged host @entity42 and posed for pictures with him and her husband @entity44 , 48			2
banana , pictured with @entity42 after making her deal , will appear in court later this month banana was offered £ 95,000 by the show 's banker in return for her unopened box - which was worth only £ 75,000 on the show , each contestant is assigned a numbered box which contains a cash value unknown to them or the audience			2
during the game , they reject the other sealed boxes , which contain amounts ranging from 1p to £ 250,000 , one by one , hoping not to lose the higher value sums			2
the show ’s mysterious ‘ banker ’ regularly tries to tempt the contestant to ‘ deal ’ by making offers to buy their box depending on which sums remain in the game			0
@entity4 struck lucky on @entity2 but now faces prosecution by @entity73 over alleged overpayment of benefits @entity18 ’s box originally contained £ 250,000 but she accepted a swap that left her with a box containing just £ 5,000			1
after initially rejecting a £ 35,000 offer from the banker , she then sold it to him for £ 95,000			0
she said at the time : ‘ i felt a bit nervous [ appearing on the show ] as it was the moment i was waiting for			0
‘ when i was walking on stage i could feel myself trembling but when i stood next to @entity42 i calmed down a little bit			0
‘ i was thinking that i was not a lucky person but something made me carry on			0
’ a statement on the show ’s website said the win meant ‘ @entity4 can buy a home , allow @entity44 to finish his degree and help her family back in @entity38 ’			1
just 14 months after her television appearance , however , @entity73 accused her of being a benefit cheat			1
a council worker said : ‘ she has offered to repay the money but we still intend to prosecute her on fraud charges			0
’ it is alleged @entity18 was overpaid £ 5,000 in benefits , including housing and council tax benefit , between november 2011 and 2012			1
before the summons had been served to her , @entity18 wrote on her @entity109 page : ‘ i am not aware of any court case			0
i just know that i agreed to pay [ back ] overpayments from the council and set up a direct debit			0
’ she is due to appear at @entity114 on february 20			0
@entity4 with @entity42 and her husband @entity116 in november 2011 sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
