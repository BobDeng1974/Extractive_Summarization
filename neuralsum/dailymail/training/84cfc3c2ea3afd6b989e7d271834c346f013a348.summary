@entity2 ladybirds invading the @entity3 are carrying a potentially deadly sti that could wipe out the native population , experts warned today			1
the long hot summer has seen an increase in the number of @entity10 ladybirds which have been threatening @entity12 insects for ten years			1
but scientists have now discovered the invaders are carrying a sexually transmitted fungal infection which coats them in a bright green mould			1
the infection - which can stop the insects moving and eating - was rarely spotted last year , but is feared to have spread to 15 per cent of the southern @entity3 population already			1
a harlequin ladybird carrying the sexually transmitted fungal infection which could wipe out @entity3 's population the threat could wipe out the @entity3 's dwindling population of two - spot ladybirds also known as @entity24 experts are worried it could spread from the foreign bugs to the struggling native two - spot ladybird and dramatically reduce their already dwindling population			1
they are urging the public to help them record rates of the mushroom - like fungus across the country			0
@entity35 phd student @entity34 , who discovered the alarming increase of the @entity4 , said : ' there has been a huge increase in it [ the infection ] this year that i have found			1
she found 15 per cent of the harlequin bugs in @entity44 parks had the infection			1
miss @entity34 said : ' it is a potential problem , but we need to know what the problems could be			0
' we do n't yet know the impact , but we are going to measure the mortality and also how many eggs an infected female is able to lay			0
the fungal infection is transmitted sexually but also when ladybirds cluster in mixed - species groups			1
pictured , a pair of mating @entity10 ladybirds different colourings on @entity10 , also known as the @entity10 ladybird , which has been a threat in @entity3 for ten years ' these are the kind of things you would expect to be impacted , but we really do n't know for certain yet			1
' these questions apply to both the harlequin and the native species			2
' we 've seen a couple of ladybirds that were very very highly affected - the mobility of one was very compromised because it had not only on it 's wing parts , but also it 's mouth parts and antenna			2
' one looked like it was wearing a pair of trousers on all it 's legs			0
' the aggressive harlequin - or @entity10 - was introduced to @entity82 in 1988 to control aphids , but spread to @entity84 , and was first spotted in @entity85 in 2004			1
it is now thought to make up 80 per cent of all ladybirds in @entity85 and @entity88			1
harlequins are resistant to many native infections , have a much more varied diets and and even eat their @entity12 counterparts			2
experts had previously seen the @entity4 - called @entity94 - in just a few of both the native and harlequins in the past , but the numbers were not recordable			2
but it is difficult to say how much it has affected the native species , because so few of them exist thanks to the invaders			1
the fungal infection - called @entity105 the ladybirds in a bright green mould and leaves little yellow bristles growing on their bodies			1
the fungus typically does not kill , although it can stop infected ladybirds from eating and moving			2
it is a sexually transmitted infection , but can also be spread during their dormant periods , when ladybirds can huddle together together in a group			1
in these cases , instead of the fungus being visible on the back of females and underneath males , the mushroom - like fungus appears on the edge of their bodies			0
miss @entity34 's tutor at the university 's @entity127 , dr @entity129 , said the disease can spread between species sexually , but also when they cluster in mixed - species groups			2
dr @entity134 , who is volunteer leader of the @entity3 @entity135 , said : ' we 've seen a real boom in this infection			2
' what we wonder is whether this is seen in ladybirds outside of @entity44 , and we want to know what does it do			0
' ' it is more likely to be spread within a species because the usually mate with the right species , but that is n't always the case , ' she said			0
' also it is n't just transferred sexually			0
in their dormant period ladybirds can huddle together in a group , and these can be mixed species groups			0
' in these cases instead of seeing the fungus on the back of the females and the underneath of the males , you see it on the edge of the bodies			0
' the researchers are now asking for help from the public to track the disease by looking for ladybirds in their houses , sheds or in leaf litter and completing an online survey			0
records will allow researchers to look at the extent and spread - rate of the epidemic			0
@entity34 added : ' the cold conditions at this time of year mean ladybirds huddle together in leaf litter or other sheltered places like houses , sheds , garages , or other outbuildings			0
' checking for these groups of ladybirds is a good way to have a look for the fungus , which leaves little yellow bristles growing on their bodies			0
' many ladybirds will have only a few of the bristles , so people will have to look carefully			0

long hot summer has seen a rise in number of @entity10 ladybirds
invaders are carrying deadly sexually transmitted fungal infection
15 per cent of native ladybird population in the south could have it
