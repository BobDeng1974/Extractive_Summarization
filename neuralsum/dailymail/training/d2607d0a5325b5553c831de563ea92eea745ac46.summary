by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 believes his attempt to con the referee early in sunday ’s dramatic last - 16 win over @entity6 did not influence the result or the penalty decision that came after he again fell theatrically under a challenge			1
the @entity11 @entity10 reacted aggressively on monday when they realised just how much profile had been given to @entity2 ’s post-match admission that he had tried to illegally win a free - kick during the 2 - 1 win in @entity16			1
however , after learning that @entity17 would not take any retrospective action following his admission of gamesmanship , @entity2 attended a specially arranged press conference on monday and reiterated his confession of the night before			1
‘ i am an honest guy but it had no influence on the game			2
it ’s a shame because yesterday in an interview after the game i was very honest			0
‘ maybe sometimes you are punished for honesty , but i always prefer to be honest			0
‘ i said there was one foul in the first half where i went to the ground because i thought he would tackle me , but he took his leg away at the last moment and i went to the ground without a touch			2
‘ it was a stupid action from me , but it had no influence on the game , had nothing to do with the penalty kick			1
‘ in the first half we should have had a penalty kick , in the second half the penalty at the end was a clear foul			1
‘ it is a shame there is so much discussion because we put on a great performance as a team			0
that should be the main thing			0
sometimes , you know , i like to be honest and i apologise for this action in the first half , but that is football			2
it had nothing to do with the result of the game			2
’ outraged : @entity6 coach @entity81 remonstrates with officials and @entity11 players at the full time whistle @entity85 , scorer of @entity29 ’s injury - time winner against @entity6 on sunday , has more goals ( 35 ) than starts ( 34 ) for the national team			1
@entity2 was accused of diving three times by @entity6 coach @entity81 after his team ’s defeat and it is clear the @entity95 winger will come under scrutiny when @entity29 face @entity97 here on saturday			1
@entity81 believes that @entity2 dived to win the decisive penalty at the death			1
‘ i do n’t change myself , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ that ’s my personality			0
‘ i think it ’s good			0
i apologised for one stupid action , but it did n’t have an influence in the game			2
‘ we had two clear penalties , one was given			0
i do n’t think we should talk about it any more			0
’ decider : @entity33 appeals after @entity2 goes down for the late penalty that won @entity29 the game @entity29 will remain at the training base in @entity117 until thursday before heading north to @entity118 ahead of saturday ’s game			1
and coach @entity120 has told his star striker @entity121 that he will be sacrificed if he is n’t fit enough or playing well enough			2
@entity122 and his captain @entity123 are thought to have a unique bond that @entity126 fans will hope can continue when the veteran coach starts life at @entity129 after the @entity130			2
but @entity122 hauled @entity123 off 15 minutes from the end of sunday night ’s dramatic win and watched as his replacement @entity85 set up one goal and scored the winner from the penalty spot			1
not going to plan : @entity121 did not have a great game against @entity6 and was taken off super sub : @entity140 - @entity85 celebrates scoring the dramatic and controversial late goal for the @entity11 afterwards , @entity122 was asked if @entity123 was injured and said : ‘ no. the substitution of @entity123 was tactical			1
‘ let ’s not forget before he joined team he was recovering from an injury			0
‘ it ’s difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes especially in these conditions			0
anyway , this trainer wants to win			2
so he makes the changes and the substitutions he needs			0
’ @entity123 is still expected to start in saturday ’s quarter - final but holding midfielder @entity155 is unlikely to recover from the groin injury that forced him off the field early on in the @entity6 game			1
‘ i do n’t know but i think it might be difficult , ’ added @entity122			0
‘ it is a muscle injury			0
’ decisive : @entity120 substituted a subdued @entity123 against @entity6 and @entity29 went on to win @entity122 has denied that his team have a straight forward route to the last four , even though quarter - final opponents @entity97 are ranked 28th in the world and had to play extra-time against @entity166 on sunday			1
‘ let me tell you the @entity11 media thought we would never survive the first round , so how we ended up becoming up favourites , i ’ll never know , ’ he said			1
‘ this group of players is very modest			0
‘ we have outstanding spirit , outstanding atmosphere , and that led to victory			0
‘ @entity97 very difficult opponents , otherwise they would n’t have ended up in a quarter - final			0
