yet @entity2 suggested ahead of the @entity20 @entity19 on sunday any discussions with @entity32 would be on an unrelated topic			1

' he said he 's going to meet @entity27 on tuesday			2
if i do n't hear ( from him ) by the end of the week i 'll send him a gentle reminder			1
' only then will we know where we stand or do n't stand , but the problems are real			0
