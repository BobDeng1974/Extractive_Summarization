by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:26 est , 4 december 2013 a new drug - free gel , called @entity5 , is set to bring relief to @entity8 's nine million arthritis sufferers a new drug - free gel may bring relief to @entity8 ’s nine million osteoarthritis sufferers			1
it can be rubbed into painful joints twice a day and , because it is drug - free , it is not thought to cause any dangerous side effects researchers carried out six clinical studies involving 4,000 patients and found @entity22 can reduce pain and improve the mobility of osteoarthritis sufferers			1
one study of 1,300 patients found it creates a natural lubricant for the joints and is as good for pain relief as commonly prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs			1
it was published in @entity32 - the @entity33 of @entity32 ’s official journal			2
dr @entity35 , a co-founder of the @entity36 , worked on the study			0
he said : ‘ it is well recognised that effectively managing chronic pain , particularly in patients with other conditions and risk factors , is a massive challenge that gps and patients face on a daily basis			2
‘ this topical treatment is drug - free and seems to have an excellent safety profile			0
’ the water - based gel is made up of millions of droplets of fat , called phospholipids , which travel through the skin and tissue , penetrating the joint			1
they then coat the cartilage with a layer of protective lubricant , replacing naturally occurring phospholipids which have been ruined by arthritis			0
this reduces friction between adjoining bones , resulting in less pain and better mobility			2
professor @entity69 , from the @entity70 , who led the research , said : ‘ the need for new treatment options is well recognised as existing treatments do n’t always work and many can cause serious side effects			2
‘ many [ osteoarthritis ] patients are elderly and have additional health conditions that mean they are especially at risk of these side effects			1
the water - based gel contains millions of fat particles which penetrate the joint and act as a lubricant between the bones			1
this increases mobility and reduces pain ‘ safety is therefore a key concern for new therapies and patients and healthcare professionals would welcome new treatment options which are effective and without such safety concerns			1
’ the gel , produced by company @entity97 , was developed in @entity98 and is already available in @entity98 and @entity99			0
it was awarded innovation of 2013 by the @entity102 of @entity98 pharmacists			0
@entity104 , chief operating officer of @entity97 , said : ‘ the proven physical mode of action and the lack of an active pharmaceutical ingredient give @entity5 the best of both worlds – it works , and it ’s safe			0
’ until january the gel is only available from @entity112 and @entity113			0
after that it will be available in all pharmacies at £ 16.80 per tube .			0
