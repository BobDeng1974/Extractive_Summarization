a ' corrupt ’ detective who worked on the initial @entity2 murder probe is to be investigated over claims that he sabotaged the inquiry			1
@entity5 will be the focus of a major new independent investigation into alleged corruption in the case			1
in a separate move yesterday , the @entity10 announced it was to investigate a @entity13 commander and two former senior officers over claims they were involved in a plot to spy on @entity2 ’s family around the time of the @entity20 public inquiry into his death			2
former detective sergeant @entity22 , right , who is now living in @entity23 is accused of stalling the investigation into @entity2 's murder , left the 18 - year - old aspiring architect was stabbed to death by a racist white gang in april 1993			1
not until 2012 were two of his killers convicted , and then only after a long campaign led by this newspaper to bring them to justice			0
the probe into @entity36 , to be announced in the next fortnight , will examine claims he had a corrupt relationship with the gangster father of one of @entity2 ’s killers and deliberately stalled the inquiry			1
in police intelligence reports the former detective sergeant was described as having ‘ no integrity as a police officer ’ and being ‘ open to offers from any source if financially viable ’			1
the @entity51 referred a file on @entity36 to the @entity10 two months ago after a damning official report raised questions about his conduct in the days following @entity2 ’s murder			2
since the report was published , a series of @entity60 investigations has exposed a web of suspected corruption in the @entity13 inquiries into the stabbing of @entity2 and axe killing of private investigator @entity66 in 1987			2
@entity13 chiefs believe it would be ‘ inappropriate ’ for the force to head the @entity36 corruption probe			0
instead , it will be carried out by a team of investigators from the @entity10 or detectives from a provincial force , supervised by the watchdog			0
barrister @entity78 ’s review of the @entity2 case in march found that @entity5 may have acted corruptly			1
it was claimed he had admitted having a ‘ corrupt connection ’ with gangland boss @entity82 , the father of @entity2 , who was finally convicted of @entity2 ’s murder in 2012 along with @entity2			1
since march , the @entity60 has published a series of investigations that showed how links between ‘ bent coppers ’ and serious organised criminals in @entity89 might have hampered or sabotaged the @entity2 and @entity66 murder inquiries			2
mr @entity66 , 37 , a father of two , was killed with an axe in march 1987 , allegedly while trying to blow the whistle on police corruption			0
nobody has yet been convicted in spite of five police investigations and admissions by the @entity51 that corruption played a part in those failings			0
the original investigation into @entity2 's murder in 1993 was hugely discredited			1
the teenager 's family had to wait almost two decades for justice it is believed that as well as working on the original @entity2 investigation , @entity5 also worked on the ‘ periphery ’ of the @entity66 murder inquiry six years earlier			1
he now runs a bar in @entity23 and denies any wrongdoing			0
should he choose to stay on the @entity114 holiday island , it is not clear how police would interview him about the @entity2 corruption allegations			2
he could only be extradited if there is already sufficient evidence to charge him			0
an @entity10 spokesman said last night : ‘ the @entity10 received a referral from the @entity51 on april 9 relating to the conduct of former detective sergeant @entity5 and specifically whether he acted corruptly during the investigation into the murder of @entity2			1
’ @entity2 ’s family have long been convinced police corruption hindered the initial murder probe			0
one of those to be investigated over the disputed spying claims and alleged ‘ discreditable conduct ’ is commander @entity130 , who was temporarily moved from his post as head of the @entity51 ’s counter-terrorism command in march			0
the review by mr @entity78 alleged he and the two other police officers , @entity136 and @entity137 , were involved in a plot to gather ‘ fascinating and valuable ’ intelligence from an undercover officer who was spying on the @entity2 family and their supporters			0
@entity2 ’s father @entity144 welcomed the @entity10 investigation last night			2
speaking from his home in @entity147 , he said : ‘ i hope the investigation is thorough and gets to the truth			0

a new independent investigation into the case will focus on @entity5
the former detective sergeant is accused of having a corrupt relationship with the father of one of @entity2 's killers
@entity5 was accused of having ' no integrity ' and was ' open to offers '
