the riots that left whole neighbourhoods up and down the country in a state of ruin last august were the worst civil disturbances for a generation			2
but reading crime figures released yesterday , it is almost as if the five days of widespread looting and violence never took place			1
nearly half of the areas worst - affected by the riots saw crime fall during that month , according to @entity17 statistics			1
in @entity19 , where a 144 - year - old furniture shop was one of dozens of buildings burned to the ground and a photo of a woman jumping from a first - floor inferno became one of the defining images of the riots , police recorded just seven disorder offences ( as well as 423 other disorder - related offences )			1
defining image : a woman jumps from a burning building in @entity19 during last summer 's riots			1
police in the ravaged @entity39 borough recorded just seven public disorder offences the disparity comes down to the way officers recorded the avalanche of offences committed during the unrest			1
some forces classified hundreds of feral thugs rampaging through different streets in the same city as just one incident of public disorder			2
similarly , mass looting in which one person broke into a shop only to be followed by dozens more was recorded as a single offence			1
and not one force reported the offence of rioting , officially defined as ' 12 or more people who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose '			1
in a statement , the @entity17 said : ' it is important to understand the basis of crime recording to appreciate the impact of the disorder incidents on crime statistics			2
' @entity74 crimes according to the number of specific victims , rather than the number of offenders			2
' but @entity79 , the owner of the 144 - year - old @entity80 in @entity19 that was destroyed in an arson attack , slammed the police 's method of recording crime as ' crazy '			1
' you would expect a great big blip in the crime statistics after those five days of rioting , ' he told the @entity89			2
' it is crazy to put down something like looting as one crime and is unnecessary			2
the whole world saw what was happening and to record it like this will just make them look ridiculous			0
' national shame : the disparity comes down to the methods used by police officers to record the avalanche of offences committed during the unrest @entity19 burning : the 144 - year - old @entity80 in flames after an arson attack			1
police forces classified hundreds of feral thugs rampaging through different streets as just one incident of public disorder police in the @entity39 borough of @entity115 recorded just one public disorder offence despite five days of unrest and 314 other offences			1
officers in @entity120 also said crime fell during august , despite recording 11 public disorder offences and 386 related crimes			1
a total of 184 incidents of violent disorder and 5,112 connected offences were recorded by police forces across @entity129			1
despite this , nine of the 15 worst affected councils recorded more crime in august 2010 than a year later			1
the figures did show that knifepoint robberies rose by 10 per cent last year and that one victim is held up by a knife - carrying criminal every 35 minutes			1
on the rise : the number of robberies committed at knife - point rose by 10 per cent in the year to september 2011 , new figures show ( picture posed by models ) senior officers have warned the attacks are carried out by muggers determined to steal smartphones and cash			1
separate figures show a double digit rise in the number of pickpocket thefts – the biggest increase for nearly a decade			1
across @entity129 and @entity155 , robbery rose by 4 per cent in the year to september 2011 compared with the previous 12 months			2
there were 15,313 knifepoint robberies in the same period – up 10 per cent from the 13,971 offences a year earlier , the crime statistics showed			1
around half of all robberies took place in @entity39 and the most common items stolen were smartphones , bags and cash			1
the @entity167 recorded a 13 per cent rise in robberies in the capital and @entity171 recorded a 10 per cent increase			1
policing minister @entity173 said there are areas of concern and crime remains too high former @entity167 commissioner @entity178 , who is chairing a commission into the future of policing set up by @entity182 , said the rise in crimes against the person was ‘ a bit alarming ’			1
he said : ‘ i ’m not surprised			0
we ’ve got to get on top of them really quickly or you could run out of control			0
’ the @entity193 , based on a poll of more than 40,000 victims , suggested a 5 per cent rise in burglary , and a 7 per cent increase in car theft			0
pickpocket thefts rose by 12 per cent to nearly 600,000 , while garden shed break - ins fuelled a 15 per cent rise in other thefts of personal property			2
however , overall recorded crime fell fractionally			2
the number recorded was down by 4 per cent to 4.1million			0
chief constable @entity208 , from the @entity209 , said : ‘ while incidents in violence against the person fell , a continued cause for concern was the increase in pickpocketing , robbery and robbery with knives			0
’ ‘ this has been driven by a rise in robberies of personal property and police will want to focus on tackling these offences and offering crime - prevention advice			1
’ meanwhile , the number of murders and other killings rose by 5 per cent in the year to march 2011 , said the @entity17			0
that is a rise of 28 – taking the total number of violent deaths to 636 , up from 608 in 2009/10			0
the latter includes the 12 victims of the @entity237 shootings in june 2010 by @entity238			0
ministers are set to introduce a ‘ tough ’ law meaning automatic jail for anyone caught carrying a knife with the intention of using it to commit a crime			2
currently just one in five of those caught carrying a knife is given a jail term			0
the rest are handed community sentences , fines or other punishments			0
policing minister @entity173 said : ‘ today ’s crime figures can not be used to show there is a long - term change in either direction			1
there are areas of concern and , as we have consistently said , crime remains too high			2
‘ we know good policing makes a difference			0
’ this article has been amended to report the number of disorder - related offences recorded in the areas worst - hit by the riots as well as the number of disorder offences			1
the reference to official crime statistics being " airbrushed " has been removed from the headline			0
justice secretary @entity275 has introduced a number of measures to reduce the prison population @entity275 ( right ) has come under constant attack over his money - saving plans to reduce the prison population by 3,000 by putting fewer offenders behind bars			0
he stunned the @entity285 conference in 2010 by announcing he wanted to scrap prison term of less than six months in favour of community sentences			0
that policy was heavily criticised last month after it emerged a quarter of criminals break their non-custodial punishments			0
last year , the justice secretary caused outrage by suggesting that some rapes were more serious than others as he attempted to defend proposed shorter jail terms for some rapists			0
then last may it was revealed that less than a third of convicted muggers and car thieves end up in jail			0
furthermore , just over half of drug dealers go to prison – and only 43 per cent of those who have sex with a child under 13 are put behind bars			0
the row within the @entity285 itself about the justice secretary 's approach re-emerged in october when home secretary @entity315 and @entity316 urged him to extend minimum jail terms to under - 18s			0
however , he dismissed their call			0
a month later , it emerged that youth courts are jailing just one in four teenage muggers			0
most young criminals are facing nothing harsher than rehabilitation , fines or community service			0
even during the ' crackdown ' over august 's riots , the average sentence was well below two years .			0
