by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 09:33 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 14:53 est , 23 july 2012 global stock markets brace for a terrible day of trading as the @entity5 was down by more than 200 points after being open for less than an hour on monday morning			1
by nearly 4pm much of the drop had recovered and the @entity5 was back to only being 78 points down			1
the significant drop has refueled fears about the stability of the euro - zone financially and the possibility that @entity14 may be in need of a formal bailout which came as the @entity17 reached 11 - year lows			1
@entity14 is the epicenter of the current bout of fears , with investors increasingly concerned that the country will not be able to turn its public finances around without outside help			1
a ban on short - selling by @entity27 and @entity14 - whereby investors are prohibited from selling stocks they do n't already own - helped contain the fallout on the @entity33 and @entity34 exchanges but did little to encourage traders elsewhere			1
if it remains around that level , investors believe the eurozone 's fourth - largest economy will likely need a financial rescue like @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			0
markets went into crisis mode this morning after the @entity14 region of @entity59 yesterday went to the central government for a bailout - following @entity61 , which took the same step on friday			1
with fears that more regions will follow and tip @entity14 into effective bankruptcy , the cost of borrowing for the @entity14 government soared and that sent the ftse 100 index of leading shares plunging 107.7 points or 1.9 per cent to 5,544.1			1
the fall follows a 1.1 per cent loss for the @entity73 on friday , and the euro also took a hammering overnight , falling to its lowest level versus the yen since november 2000 , at 94.37			1
with traders anticipating a fully - fledged bailout for @entity14 , the yield on @entity14 10 - year bonds shot up a further 30 basis points to a crisis level of 7.59 per cent and two - year yields were up almost 90 points at 6.64 per cent , while @entity14 's @entity87 stock index tumbled almost 6 per cent , its worst fall in two years			1
@entity93 's @entity91 and @entity92 's @entity90 indices were also down 1.6 - 1.9 per cent			0
' @entity53 is not far from leaving the euro which is not as big a deal as it was one year ago , but @entity14 was not as much a worry a year ago and is an enormously big deal today , ' said @entity98 , hedge fund manager at @entity99			1
against the dollar , the euro sank below $ 1.2100 for the first time in more than two years , hitting a low of $ 1.2093 and creeping ever closer to the 2010 trough of $ 1.1876			1
although sterling lost a little ground against the single currency today , it stands close to four - year highs at more than € 1.28 to the pound			1
' with such strong risk aversion it is the yen and the dollar that will keep gaining against risk currencies , ' said @entity114 , currency analyst at the @entity115 in @entity116			2
' the @entity14 scenario has not been priced in yet			2
' officials from the @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 will meet today with the @entity53 government government to discuss progress with its budget pledges			0
if @entity53 is unable to deliver the spending cuts and tax reforms necessary then the so - called troika are unlikely to be forthcoming with further aid and a @entity53 exit from the single currency bloc will be back on the cards			2
crisis mode : world stocks skidded lower today as @entity14 's regional governments topple into insolvency over the weekend , the @entity14 region of @entity59 said it would seek government financial assistance , and media reported that half a dozen other regional governments were ready to follow in the footsteps of @entity61 , which on friday asked for help from a new rescue fund			1
@entity120 president @entity144 tried to quell fears that the eurozone is spiralling back into crisis , with a statement that the euro is ' irreversible ' and that there is no danger of the single currency bloc breaking up			2
the @entity120 president went even further to suggest that , far from collapsing , the eurozone is set to become even stronger and more integrated			0
speaking in an interview with @entity92 newspaper @entity156 on saturday , mr @entity144 dismissed some analysts ' worse case scenarios for the euro			0
' we see analysts imagining the scenario of a eurozone blow - up , ' he said			0
' they do n’t recognise the political capital that our leaders have invested in this union and @entity169 ' support			0
mr @entity144 went on to say that in the long term , greater integration will be necessary among eurozone countries , saying that movement towards ' financial , budgetary and political union ' is ' inevitable '			0
on the up : at 1.285 euros , the pound is 14 per cent stronger versus the euro than this time last year @entity169 leaders took a step towards greater integration last month at a @entity183 summit where they agreed to put the @entity120 in charge of supervising banks and gave the @entity187 rescue fund the power to recapitalise troubled banks			2
but @entity14 's borrowing costs have remained stubbornly high despite the approval last of the £ 80billion rescue package for its beleaguered banks			2
stock markets across @entity195 were also hit overnight , with @entity197 's nikkei 225 index losing 1.9 per cent , @entity199 's @entity198 falling 1.8 per cent and @entity202 's @entity201 index shedding 1.7 per cent			0
the outlook for the @entity205 economy was little better , with the government braced for official data on wednesday that is expected to confirm the @entity205 has failed to climb out of recession amid calls from @entity211 mayor @entity210 that ministers do more to boost confidence and growth			2
gross domestic product figures for the period between april and june , published on wednesday , are expected to show that the double - dip recession has persisted			0
the economy entered a technical recession in the first quarter of 2012 , with gross domestic product declining by 0.3 per cent after a 0.4 per cent drop in the final quarter of 2011			0
@entity224 , an economist at brokers @entity225 , forecast a further slump in output of around 0.4 per cent			0
the gloomy picture provoked mr @entity210 to launch an outspoken attack yesterday on @entity231 and @entity233 ’s handling of the economy – demanding action to boost public confidence and growth			0
video : markets are taking a beating ...			0

@entity17 falls to 11 - year low against the yen and 2 - year low versus @entity41 dollar
more @entity14 regional governments expected to call on central government for help , *sparking* fears @entity14 will need full bailout
by 4pm the @entity5 was back to only being 78 points down
