they are esteemed badges of honour to commemorate a building where important people throughout history lived and worked			0
and the @entity6 blue plaques scheme – administered by @entity7 since 1986 – has been running for nearly 150 years and is thought to be the oldest of its kind in the world			1
but @entity7 has come under fire for choosing a blue plaques panel of celebrity ‘ white men off the telly ’ , prompting a slew of resignations from the existing panel			1
involved : the new panel now boasts the likes of arts council chair sir @entity22 ( left ) , who brought @entity23 to the @entity24 , and @entity26 chairman @entity25 ( right ) famed : the panel , which is responsible for selecting the historical figures to be honoured with the famous plaques , also features broadcaster and art dealer @entity30 ( left ) , and scientist and tv presenter professor @entity31 ( @entity33 ) @entity34 ( right ) the new panel , which is responsible for selecting the historical figures to be honoured with the famous plaques , now boasts the likes of arts council chair sir @entity22 , who brought @entity23 to the @entity24 ; @entity26 chairman @entity25 ; broadcaster and art dealer @entity30 ; scientist and tv presenter professor @entity34 ; tv host and physicist professor @entity39 and banker @entity40			1
these appointments saw two existing members of the panel , @entity44 , professor of the history of science and technology at @entity49 , @entity6 , and architectural journalist @entity50 , quit three weeks ago			1
professor @entity44 slammed the new appointments and told @entity54 : ‘ instead of a blue plaques panel , @entity7 are creating a white - men - off - the - telly panel , with a banker added			1
‘ it is hardly expert , especially in history , and is not representative			0
such a panel may wish to fund its own plaque scheme , but it should not call itself the blue plaques panel , nor should a scheme advised by such a panel be in receipt of public money			1
‘ people are not so dumb that they want their blue plaques decided on by people they might have seen on television			2
’ appointments : tv host and physicist professor @entity39 ( left ) and banker @entity40 ( right ) are also on the new panel famous : what was once the home of author @entity77 , at 13 @entity78 , in @entity79 , south - west @entity6 professor @entity44 had been a member of the panel for six years – yet only discovered the new appointments when reading the addressees of the agenda to the next meeting			1
he said he feared the appointments had been made purely to encourage donations , adding : ‘ @entity7 is the custodian of the blue plaques panel , not its owner			1
‘ proposers , supporters and the public will rightly expect the blue plaques panel to be expert , particularly in history			1
‘ they will also expect it to be representative so that plaques are awarded to people distinguished in all fields , including those currently under - represented			0
’ the new blue plaque panel appointments have also been condemned for being entirely male			2
ms @entity50 said she was appalled by the lack of females on the panel and said : ‘ the appointments are all male and , with the exception of @entity39 , they are all over 60			2
‘ and the other point is that they are all busy people			0
i doubt they will find time to scrutinise these decisions			0
‘ @entity110 was appointed to the panel last year and they make a lot of that			0
but , well , let ’s just say her attendance record has n’t been very good			0
’ professor @entity44 and ms @entity50 were asked whether they wished to assist in the appointment of their replacements , but declined			0
in a letter to professor @entity120 , chairman of the panel , professor @entity44 said : ‘ i do n’t feel able to recommend anyone , nor indeed to recommend that anyone accept an invitation to serve			0
‘ i am sorry to be blunt , but @entity7 have clearly made up their mind what panel they want , and have got it			0
’ example : the master of suspense , sir @entity131 , was honoured in 1999 with an @entity7 blue plaque being unveiled by his daughter @entity133 at 153 @entity134 , @entity6 , where he lived for 13 years author : an @entity7 blue plaque marking a former home of writer @entity139 in @entity140 , @entity6 last year the funding for the blue plaque panel was suspended after government cash was slashed , and its support staff was reduced by 30 per cent			2
' instead of a blue plaques panel , @entity7 are creating a white - men - off - the - telly panel , with a banker added ' professor @entity44 , @entity49 a spokesman for @entity7 said further appointments were being made , including that of professor @entity152 , master of @entity153 , @entity154			1
he told the @entity54 : ‘ we were disappointed to receive the resignations of two blue plaque panel members			2
‘ we are confident that , once complete , the panel will represent the full range of in - depth knowledge and expertise required to consider all the different blue plaque nominations			0
