there are some moments when you just wish the ground would open up and swallow you - especially when you 're a bloke trying to sneak out of a @entity5 screening			2
just when he thought he 'd got away with catching a sneaky peak at the raunchy new flick this not - so - secret fan walked straight into a tv camera			1
local broadcaster @entity11 / @entity10 was filming an interview with a female film goer at the premiere of the film in @entity16 , @entity17			1
after an excruciating moment of indecision the man , who appears to have been to the screening on his own , turns around and heads back down the corridor , taking a sneaky peak back over his shoulder at the camera like a guilty schoolboy			1
perhaps hoping to find a different exit he soon realises he 's got nowhere else to go and makes another embarrassing about face and , head down , shuffles past the camera as quickly as he can second time around			1
ironically the female interviewer and the tv reporter have just got on to discussing why men have been staying away from @entity5 as the hapless man finally makes his escape			2
realizing he 's got nowhere to go he turns around again as it 's clear the crew wo n't be packing up and leaving he desperately looks for a way out as two other film goers walk past , clearly less embarrassed at being filmed @entity56 down , he prepares to face the music and make the getaway he might have done the first time round just as the man walks past , the interviewee is asked just why it is men have been avoiding the film the long - awaited flick , panned as dull ' housewife porn ' by critics , is largely drawing female audiences in @entity17			1
the painfully awkward 22 - second clip has been seen more than 1.7million times and racked up more than 2,000 comments on @entity72 , mostly poking fun at the unfortunate man 's embarrassment			1

others came to the @entity16 man 's defence			2

another added : ' why does it matter if a man saw it ? just because a man sees a feminine movie , it does n't make him weak , any less of a man , or a pervert			0
' fifty @entity103 , starring @entity104 ( pictured ) , has been panned as ' housewife porn ' by critics			0
