the @entity1 wants to avoid the types of problems that plagued @entity8 's initial public offering in 2012 on rival @entity9			1
the @entity1 , run by @entity10 , regularly does systems testing on the weekends , but this was the first time it had run a simulated ipo , and it did so at the request of its member firms - many of whom took part in @entity8 's ipo on @entity20 's main exchange			1
@entity4 is marching towards this year 's most anticipated initial public offering in the @entity22 , and is expected to begin trading on the @entity1 in mid-november			1
the @entity1 was testing mainly for two things : to see if its systems could handle the amount of message traffic that might be generated by the ipo ; and to make sure that once the ipo took place any firms that placed orders would promptly receive the reports telling them that their orders had been @entity33 can also be seen as part of @entity1 's struggle with @entity9 for supremacy in technology listings			0
both exchanges vied to be home to @entity4 's stock , and many analysts said the trading disruptions that occurred on @entity8 's @entity9 debut likely played to @entity1 's favor , as it tries to become the destination of choice for technology listings , something @entity9 once @entity49 , which intends to sell 70 million shares at between $ 17 and $ 20 each , will be holding the biggest internet ipo since @entity8 , which sold a much larger 421 million shares at $ 38 each			1
@entity4 is expected to start trading as early as november 7			0
in the case of @entity8 , the tremendous volume of orders on the first day of trading exposed a glitch in @entity9 's system , ultimately preventing timely order confirmations for many traders , leaving them unsure about their exposure for hours , and in some cases for days afterwards			0
major market makers estimated they lost collectively up to $ 500 million in the @entity66 absence of @entity9 ceo @entity67 while the meltdown was occurring magnified the criticism toward the exchange - he had been celebrating the debut at @entity8 's @entity73 headquarters before jumping on a plane back to @entity75			2
the @entity1 did a test run of @entity4 's highly anticipated market debut , as it seeks to avoid the types of problems that plagued @entity8 's initial public offering on rival @entity9			1
@entity9 was fined $ 10 million by the @entity81 - the largest fine ever for an exchange - and said it would voluntarily pay up to $ 62 million to compensate firms that had been harmed			0
on friday , @entity9 said $ 41.6 million of claims put forward qualified for the compensation @entity87 chaotic debut also contributed to a decline in @entity8 's stock			2
the stock hit a low of $ 17.55 in august , though it has since more than recovered the losses , closing on friday at $ 51.95 , well above its ipo @entity9 had tested its systems in the lead - up to the ipo , allowing member firms to place dummy orders to a test symbol over a specific period , it limited the total number of orders that could be received in the simulation to 40,000			0
on the day of the ipo , over 496,000 orders were placed before the ipo opened , with around 82 million shares traded			2
by the end of the day , more than 500 million shares had traded hands , a record for an @entity111 's tests on saturday ran hundreds of thousands of orders , with one single firm placing an order at one point for nearly 81 million shares			2
" this morning 's systems test was successful , and we 're grateful to all the firms that chose to participate , " an @entity1 spokesman said			0
" we are being very methodical in our planning for @entity4 's ipo , and are working together with the industry to ensure a world - class experience for @entity4 , retail investors and all market participants			0
" three test iposon an average trading day , there are around 700 people on the floor of the @entity1 dressed in business suits , many also wearing blue jackets with their firms ' names emblazoned on @entity137 saturday , about 20 people - floor operators , technicians , and designated market makers , who are akin to air traffic controllers for stocks , overseeing trading and ensuring fair and orderly markets - gathered in small groups around various screens , dressed in jeans and sipping @entity149 7 a.m. , just as they would for an actual ipo , over 20 @entity1 member firms began sending in their orders for the @entity4 ipo simulation			1
the market opened up as it normally would at 9:30 a.m. , but in this case using data from friday to recreate a normal environment with 3,800 listed stock trading			0
ipo orders kept coming in and @entity1 had a phone line open to keep members apprised of the situation and to answer @entity163 before 10 a.m. , the first of three test ipos to mimic the @entity4 debut took place , using the symbol @entity170 designated market maker ( @entity158 ) , in this case a representative from @entity172 , ran the auction , with orders coming in electronically on a screen and from brokers on the floor using hand - held @entity179 major difference between @entity1 's system and @entity9 's is that @entity9 's is fully electronic , while @entity1 's normal ipo procedures include human intervention , through the @entity183 a price had been determined , based on the orders that had come in , and following communication with the investment bankers and brokers , the @entity158 froze the order book and hit a blue " done " button on his keyboard			1
immediately after , alerts went off on the brokers ' handheld devices indicating their orders had been @entity1 employee on the floor wearing a @entity197 earpiece , who was connected to the call with member firms , called out the action as it happened.the exercise was completed two more times , using test symbols @entity205 and @entity206 , with @entity207 and @entity208 as @entity209 , and with saws and drills buzzing in the background from weekend renovations , instead of the usual din of @entity215 and @entity9 have said 2013 is shaping up to be their best ipo year in more than half a decade .			0
