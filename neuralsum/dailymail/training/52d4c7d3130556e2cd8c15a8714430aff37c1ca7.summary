as millions of @entity1 are scrambling to get their tax returns postmarked by this evening , a smaller sect did something much more drastic and renounced their @entity1 citizenship			1
last year alone , almost 1,800 people renounced their @entity1 citizenship or handed in their @entity7 – and many of them said it was because of tax reasons			1
that 's a record number since the @entity12 began publishing a list of those who renounced in 1998			1
it 's also almost eight times more than the number of citizens who renounced in 2008 , and more than the total for 2007 , 2008 and 2009 combined			1
no longer @entity1 : @entity20 , who renounced her @entity1 citizenship to become @entity21 , poses in @entity22 ; last year , almost 1,800 people renounced their @entity1 citizenship or handed in their @entity7 not worth it : @entity1 ex-pats still must pay taxes on their earned income and are subject to complicated filing laws the @entity1 is one of the only countries to tax its citizens on income earned while they 're living abroad			1
and just as @entity1 stateside must file tax returns each april - this year , the deadline is tuesday - an estimated 6.3 million @entity1 citizens living abroad brace for what they describe as an even tougher process of reporting their income and foreign accounts to the @entity12			1
for them , the deadline is june			0
the @entity42 , part of the @entity12 , released a report in december that details the difficulties of filing taxes from overseas			0
it cites heavy paperwork , a lack of online filing options and a dearth of local and foreign - language resources			0
for those wishing to legally escape the filing requirements , the only way is to formally renounce their @entity1 citizenship			1
last year , @entity12 records show that at least 1,788 people did , and that 's likely an underestimate			2
the @entity12 publishes in the @entity62 the names of those who give up their citizenship , and some who renounced say they have n't seen their name on the list yet			1
alarming : since the @entity12 started publishing those renounced in 1998 , numbers have skyrocketed in fact , @entity71 declared plans to renounce his @entity1 citizenship a year ago , in @entity74			1
' @entity75 ' - it 's not enough anymore , ' the comic book superhero said , after both the @entity78 and @entity1 governments criticized him for joining a peaceful anti-government protest in @entity81			2
the @entity82 said records it keeps differ from those published by the @entity12			0
they indicate that renunciations have remained steady , at about 1,100 each year , said an official			0
the decision by the @entity12 to publish the names is referred to by lawyers as ' name and shame			0
' that 's because those who renounce are seen as willing to give up their citizenship primarily for financial reasons			0
there 's also an ' exit tax ' for the very rich who choose to leave			1
during the last 25 years , a number of millionaires and billionaires have renounced their citizenship			1
among them : @entity105 , the late founder of @entity107 , and @entity108 , a former @entity109 director			0
mad money : a woman wearing a a @entity113 costume encourages people to get their taxes done before today 's deadline tuesday blues : @entity118 ( centre ) and his wife @entity120 do their taxes at an @entity123 office in @entity124 , @entity125 leaving : an @entity126 last year had @entity71 renouncing his citizenship but those of more modest means renounce , too			1
they say leaving @entity1 is about more than money ; it 's about privacy and red tape			2
two filing requirements affect @entity1 abroad : the @entity136 - which has been around since 1970 but now carries penalties for noncompliance - and the @entity139 , passed in 2010 with the aim of reducing offshore tax evasion			1
the first regulation requires all @entity1 , including those living abroad , with at least $ 10,000 in overseas bank accounts , to file a supplementary form disclosing all of their foreign accounts			1
that includes any accounts in which the @entity1 citizen has a financial interest			2
that could include a joint account with a spouse or child , accounts for corporations in which the @entity1 owns more than 50 per cent of the value of shares of stock , or any trust or estate that benefits the @entity1 citizen			2
the tax compliance act - the newer law - asks foreign financial institutions such as banks , hedge funds , and private equity funds to provide the @entity12 with information on @entity1 clients			1
the @entity1 and five @entity170 countries recently announced their intent to allow institutions to report the information through their own governments , rather than directly to the @entity12			1
institutions that do not comply will be subject to a 30 per cent withholding tax on certain @entity1 - sourced payments and proceeds of property sales beginning in the 2013 tax year - for instance , dividends on investments in @entity1 companies			1
some expatriates say they were unaware of the first regulation for years and even decades			0
in 2008 , the @entity12 received only 218,840 such filings			0
@entity1 nationality law grants citizenship to almost everyone born in the @entity1 or born abroad to @entity1 parents , regardless of how much time they 've spent in the @entity1			1
many may not even know the extent of their @entity1 ties			2
advocate : @entity196 co-runs @entity197 , a women 's expat organization serving overseas @entity1 and the international community in 2004 , the stakes for noncompliance rose			0
failure to file meant potential fines and criminal charges			0
americans abroad can be punished for noncompliance even if they owed no income tax - and @entity12 data show that most of them do n't owe money			1
income up to $ 95,100 is n't taxed under a rule called the @entity209			1
in 2009 , the income cap was $ 91,400 , and 88 per cent of all taxpayers claiming the foreign earned income exclusion owed nothing			2
since 2008 , the @entity12 has offered several voluntary - disclosure grace periods during which expatriates can file back taxes without facing criminal charges - but with the possibility of incurring penalties			0
@entity220 , head of @entity221 , a non-profit organization based in @entity222 , says that many members feel scared about reporting requirements they did not know existed			0
their disenchantment , she says , is pushing some to renounce			0
' @entity1 abroad are terrified			2
we 've had people pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines			1
' - @entity221 's @entity220 ' @entity1 abroad are terrified			2
we 've had people pay tens of thousands of dollars in fines			1
we 've had people … pay huge amounts of back taxes , ' she says			2
' up to this point , we never heard of anyone renouncing , or if they did , they did n't talk about it , ' says ms @entity220 , who says her group does not advocate renunciation			0
' now , ' she says , ' we 're seeing a lot of people speak openly about it and come to us for information			0
' @entity246 is taking note			0
' while i fully support measures that reduce fraud and address offshore havens , the @entity1 should not have policies that place undue burdens on legitimate @entity1 abroad , ' says representative @entity254 , @entity255 , and the chair of the @entity257			2
ms @entity254 says she has taken the matter to the @entity259 , which oversees the @entity12			0
the @entity12 did not respond to requests for comment			0
lawyers report that banking is a big reason why people renounce			0
' i hear about banking problems again and again and again , ' says @entity267 , an attorney who has been helping @entity1 expatriate since 2008			2
the new reporting rules , he says , pose ' a huge administrative burden			0
it 's made @entity1 too expensive to keep			0

record 1,800 people renounced @entity1 citizenship last year alone , up eight times the number of those who did in 2008
@entity1 one of few countries to tax its citizens on income earned while abroad
taxes for *ex-patriots* are *notoriously* difficult ; income up to $ 95,100 is n't taxed under @entity209 , but *wealthy* must also pay ' exit tax ' to leave @entity1
many expats are unaware of complicated laws and often have to pay thousands of dollars in in fines
