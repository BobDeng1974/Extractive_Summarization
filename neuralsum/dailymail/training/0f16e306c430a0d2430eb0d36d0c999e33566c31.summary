by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 part of the way through a group interview with newspaper reporters in @entity7 this week , @entity2 paused when presented with a theory about @entity10 ’s current eminence in the @entity11			2
‘ i have learned the word “ entice ”			2
you are enticing me , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ i said “ provoke ” yesterday but @entity16 said it ’s “ entice ”			2
that is what you are trying to do			2
’ welcome to the world of the new @entity23 manager			1
it is fair to suggest that life inside the @entity23 dressing room is currently not dull			1
this time when @entity12 was asked whether the stereotype of a typical @entity43 footballer — fit , fuelled by adrenaline and emotion , but lacking sophistication — was true			1
‘ that is your opinion , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ you say it , then you say i have to say it			2
i do n’t know because i have to know the players first then i can judge			1
you can judge because you have been a journalist for many years and have seen the culture			2
‘ i have said the players under the direction of @entity57 were a lot different from the players under the direction of @entity60 , but also under me			1
‘ but we shall have to wait and see			2
from the outside it is fair to say what you have said			2
but i do n’t want to be judging as an outsider			2
‘ i want to hear that and feel that but at the moment they are doing great			2
’ plans : @entity12 ( left ) speaks alongside @entity70 at the press conference in @entity72 drills : @entity74 ( centre ) , @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 ( second left ) taking part in the session @entity74 keen to impress : @entity74 trains between @entity80 ( left ) and @entity81 ( right ) @entity12 has few complaints about his @entity23 players so far			1
certainly not in terms of their attitude			0
he knows the squad he inherited from @entity57 is not good enough — calling it ‘ broken ’ — and is trying to fix it both in the transfer market and on the training field			1
he says he will not buy players for the short term and is more concerned with nurturing players ’ minds on the training field			1
it will , he says , be a long process but he believes he has evidence it will work			1
‘ the way you see @entity100 still playing with six players from my time is because i gave a lot of chances to the youth players , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ the structure and the culture of the club is @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 ( his players , though @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 have left )			1
‘ at @entity116 it was the same			1
every club where i have been , i have struggled for the first three months			1
after that , they know what i want			0
how i am as a human being and a manager			1
‘ i say things as they are , so you have to adapt to that way of coaching			0
it ’s not so easy			0
i train the brains and not the legs			0
i am not for running			0
i am for running with the ball , but they like that of course			0
‘ a lot of these players are playing intuitively and i want them to think and know why they do something			2
‘ that ’s a process that is difficult and it takes time			0
’ hoping to impress : @entity140 has is one of those out to impress his new manager boss : @entity145 chats to @entity2 as the @entity147 players warm up some coaches obsess about the bigger picture , others scrutinise in astonishing detail			1
it seems @entity12 will attempt to do both			1
stories of life on tour with the @entity158 veteran already include minute changes to seating arrangements in restaurants and an almost frightening obsession with time - keeping			0
interestingly , he is an hour late for this interview , but , just as during the @entity164 , he is worth it			0
over the course of a 25 - minute chat he reveals more than it is possible to chronicle in detail here			0
he says he was approached about the @entity23 job in the 1990s , for example			1
‘ i was already asked to join @entity23 in the 90s because @entity60 wanted to quit at that time , ’ he said			1
‘ that would have been easier			0
‘ i do n’t think it ’s easy now because when you have a club that normally plays from first position , and now you are seventh , then you know the team is not in balance or is broken , or that the confidence or something like that is wrong			1
‘ i had to follow @entity184 at @entity100			1
he had won three titles			0
i do n’t think “ broken ” is a hard word because when you are seventh the team is not happy , and without confidence , and when you are like that you are broken			2
‘ so now they have me			0
a new manager , new chances for the players and they want to show themselves unbelievably			1
that is nice that they want to do that			0
‘ but we have to make a way of playing football that is not the same as before , and that is difficult for them			0
they have to perform under pressure			0
they have to decide what to do with the ball within one second and that is not easy			0
’ power trio : @entity12 chats with @entity16 and @entity210 last week in @entity211 all smiles : the trio looking incredibly cheerful as they pose for a photo there has been much talk about @entity12 ’s new playing formation at @entity23 and it remains valid			1
it is radically different from what has gone before and the coach is perhaps right to warn of teething problems			0
what strikes you most about him , however , is his sheer self - belief , a confidence that stretches almost to the point of utter conviction			0
certainly we did n’t see that from @entity57 , who , in fairness , did n’t have a c.v			1
like his successor ’s to bolster him			0
‘ i already had a lot of opportunities to work in @entity43 , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ but at the time the priority was not like it is now			0
i am already 62 , so my career is reaching the end			2
i was in @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity158 so there ’s only one football country i wanted to see inside and that was @entity43			1
i had more offers than just @entity23			1
‘ i do n’t say it ’s a dream , because i am 62 and i know what i can do and i think @entity23 know what i can do and i think that is why they have come for me			1
i am not a child any more , but it ’s fantastic because not any coach can work with the biggest clubs			2
' i have experience because i worked in @entity241 and @entity242 with the no 1 clubs			0
i speak the language and , for me , communication is very important			0
’ @entity12 has a reputation for a rather hard - line attitude with the media			1
so far , it has not been apparent			0
he was skilful enough to duck questions about @entity266 and saw the @entity10 one coming like a train hurtling down a mile of straight track			0
one - nil to him , perhaps			0
he knows the threat from across town to be real , though			0
‘ it does not bother me whether they are 10 metres away or 30 kilometres , ’ he said			0
‘ it is amazing because they were not a big club before but now they are knocking at the door			2
but that is good , because where there is competition you can be proud when you are the champion			0
at the end maybe we will be the champions ! ’			0

@entity12 *embracing* his new role as manager of @entity23
he says the direction of the players will be different under him than with *sir* @entity60 or @entity57
believes the squad that he inherited from his *predecessor* is ' broken '
@entity12 will obsess about the bigger picture and focus on the smaller details surrounding the club
aiming for the same success he achieved at @entity100 and @entity116
says he *'s* had plenty of opportunities to work in @entity43 during his career
