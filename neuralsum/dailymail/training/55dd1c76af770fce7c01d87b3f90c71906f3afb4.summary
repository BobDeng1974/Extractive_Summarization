by @entity0 published : 01:05 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 02:58 est , 18 november 2013 most everyone likes their hash browns golden brown and their toast nice and crunchy , but new research says that the crispier some breakfast foods are cooked , the more likely they are to give you cancer			1
that ’s thanks to a chemical called acrylamide , which is found mostly in plant based foods and appears to accumulate the longer those foods are cooked			1
and breakfast may be the biggest source of acrylamide since fried potatoes and toasted bread are some of the biggest sources of the menacing chemical			2
golden goodness ? maybe not			0
new research says the longer you cook potatoes , the more they 'll accumulate acrylamide -- a chemical found to cause cancer in mice according to the @entity35 , acrylamide has likely been around forever in food but has recently been found to cause cancer in lab mice			1
it seems to form in the largest quantity when foods are prepared with high - temperature cooking			2
that means frying , roasting or baking			0
so some of the worst offenders are @entity49 fries and other fried potatoes because the tuber is already more likely than other foods to form acrylamide			1
when you cook the taters to a delicious , golden brown , voila : more cancer - causing acrylamide			2
like your toast burnt ? you may want to think twice since it could have far more cancer - causing acrylamide , which the @entity35 now says to reduce in your diet by eating more veggies and fruits and by cooking foods in less heat - intensive ways grout for breakfast ? acrylamide is n't just found in overcooked foods , it 's also used industrially in grout , water treatment products , and plastics the chemical is n’t likely to be found in meat , fish or dairy and does n’t seem to form when foods like potatoes are prepared through steaming or boiling			1
acrylamide is n’t just found in foods , it ’s also used in commercial products and manufacturing			0
aside from a perfectly brown potato , the chemical is found in plastics , grouts , water treatment products , and cosmetics			0
and , not surprisingly , in cigarette smoke			0
short of telling consumers to quit eating fried , baked , or roasted foods altogether , the agency suggests a vegetable and fruit rich diet with whole grains and lean proteins			0
by displacing a largely burnt toast and fried potato diet with a more varied one , you can sneak an acrylamide - containing morsel once in a while without having to worry			1
shocker : not surprisingly , the @entity35 says that smokers are getting a healthy dose of the cancer causing compound as well			0

a chemical called acrylamide is *prevalent* in plant - based foods and the longer they *'re* cooked , the more of it that forms
potatoes are the worst offenders and toast is n't far behind
acrylamide has been found to cause cancer in mice and the @entity35 now says to try to cut down on acrylamide intake by eating a more *balanced* diet and cooking foods like potatoes for shorter *periods*
