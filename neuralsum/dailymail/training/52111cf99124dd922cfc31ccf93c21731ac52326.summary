@entity1 manager @entity0 has called for the establishment of an independent panel to help stamp out diving and to retrospectively ban those found guilty			1
@entity7 boss @entity6 this week spoke out over what he saw as a ' clear campaign ' against the @entity11 leaders after midfielder @entity12 was cautioned by referee @entity13 for simulation in the match at @entity16 , when the player looked to have in fact been tripped by defender @entity19 in the penalty area			1
it is not the first time this season @entity7 have found themselves at the centre of a diving storm			1
@entity0 makes a point to an official , and has called on diving decisions to be taken out of referees ' hands @entity12 was booked for a dive after seemingly being tripped by @entity16 defender @entity19 forwards @entity32 and @entity34 were both booked for supposedly taking a tumble in the win over @entity37 , while on @entity40 , the @entity39 manager @entity38 accused @entity7 defender @entity41 of going down ' looking for a penalty '			1
@entity0 - who had a touchline bust - up with @entity6 during @entity1 's defeat at @entity45 in october - quipped he ' very much ' felt sorry for the supposed campaign against @entity7 players			1
however , the @entity49 manager agrees something must be done to eradicate the trend of those looking to win an unfair advantage			0
@entity12 makes his point to referee @entity13 but @entity7 were still punished on the pitch @entity6 and @entity0 have had differences but the @entity49 has sympathised with his opposite number ' i am against diving			1
we should punish after the game			0
the problem will be to decide when it was obvious diving or not			2
that is a big issue and sometimes it is not obvious , ' said the @entity1 boss , who takes his side to @entity16 on @entity70			1
' yes ( there should be a panel ) , and the most suited to this are people who have an experience in the game , and ( then ) to punish only obvious cases , but not mixed ones			1
' naming ( those guilty ) alone does n't work , you have to suspend the players			2
( how long should the ban be ? ) i do n't know			2
' i am not a specialist in this kind of thing , but the only way that the players will stop doing it , is if they feel they can get punished			0
' is it @entity1 , or @entity90 , or @entity91 or @entity7 ? it is the same for everybody			1
' @entity1 , of course , are not immune to accusations of simulation			1
@entity97 infamously took a tumble against @entity99 which resulted in a controversial penalty during the @entity103 ' @entity102 campaign of 2003 - 04 , while striker @entity104 was initially banned by @entity105 for diving when winning a spot - kick in the @entity109 qualifier against @entity110 in august 2009 , which was eventually overturned on appeal			0
@entity97 ( left ) famously dived to win a penalty in a win over @entity99 during the invincible season @entity0 accepts sometimes such instincts are part of a footballer 's make - up			2
he said : ' it is difficult for me to judge what 's happening anywhere else on that front , but you can never really meet a manager who says he is in favour of diving anyway			0
' we had them , with @entity97 , with @entity104			0
it is down to the players			0
' ( but ) even if you talk to the players , the guys who have that in them , they will do it in the game			0
' however , @entity37 manager @entity140 was not convinced by @entity0 's suggestion of a panel , despite insisting that some action needs to be taken			1
@entity140 claims players diving threatens the honesty of the @entity11 that makes it admired across the world			2
@entity140 labelled @entity148 's fall against his @entity37 team as like ' something out of @entity151 ' the @entity37 boss is n't sure that a panel is the way ahead , but believes action must be taken against divers last month the @entity37 boss compared a @entity148 dive against his side to ' something out of @entity151 ' , but admits it can be tough to differentiate between dives and fouls with some players			1
@entity140 said : ' it 's very difficult for referees when you have people like [ @entity168 ] hazard and @entity34 , who are genuinely quick and take you on with a low centre of gravity - the slightest tap can take them over			2
' but when you see a blatant dive , i think you have to take action			0
the reason why the @entity11 is the league that it is , is for its honesty , its integrity and ferocity			0
' you must remember that people enjoy the honesty of the @entity11 all over the world			0
we ca n't make it like every other league - it 's a different culture			0
' i 'm not so sure about a panel , but we have to start taking action against it			0

@entity1 boss says obvious divers should be handed bans
@entity6 has claimed their is a ' clear campaign ' against @entity7
however @entity0 does n't believe any club has been particularly targeted
@entity140 questions panel idea , but admits something must be done
