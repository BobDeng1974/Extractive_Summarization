' he said that there may have been ' many and varied offences ' against the women , who were allegedly held captive at various addresses in @entity13 , but that their ordeal may not be defined as slavery			1
' we need to maintain an open mind on what this particular incident is before we jump to those conclusions and labels , ' mr @entity141 said			0
