' i am satisfied had he known what was required he would have done that which was necessary			0
' as it was he was not given the information , not advised and thus did not fulfil the requirement of the regulations			0

every good word in the dictionary			0
i had n't dared to let myself believe it would happen ' she added : ' i really want to make sure it does n't happen again			0
' the physiotherapist from @entity154 previously told the @entity18 that her late husband would not have wanted to place a time limit on her conceiving his child			2

a lawyer representing the @entity195 ( @entity195 ) had earlier told the judge that officials sympathised with mrs @entity6			2
but @entity198 said mr @entity7 , a ski instructor , had not given the proper written consent to his sperm being stored beyond april 2015			1
argument : the @entity195 said it had ' every sympathy ' with ms @entity6 but says that they have ' no discretion ' over the timings a lawyer representing mrs @entity6 told the judge that the authority was taking an ' excessively linguistic and technical approach ' and suggested that every option had not been made clear to mr @entity7			1
