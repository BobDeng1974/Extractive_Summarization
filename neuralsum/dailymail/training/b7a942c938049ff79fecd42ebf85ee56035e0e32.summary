by @entity1 reporter published : 14:36 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 15:33 est , 4 march 2014 a 23 - year - old @entity4 trainee who was recruited as an undercover informant has been caught up in a nasty battle with her former supervisors as they have launched an effort to smear her reputation and possibly get her kicked out of the military after allegedly being raped			1
@entity11 originally intended to go into the @entity4 's meteorology program but was diverted after being asked to work for the secretive @entity13 , effectively using her connections to her peers to help root out drug rings			1
in a lengthy @entity18 feature , ms @entity11 describes how she has gone through months of logistical haranging with the organization that she thought would protect her , at points being left feeling ' straight up suicidal '			2
turning on the turncoat : the @entity13 partnered with @entity11 , who was 23 at the time , to work as an undercover informant but now they are building a case against her the ordeal began on july 26 , 2013 when ms @entity11 went with a group of people she thought might have information about drug sales in and around @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			1
she went with them to a party at a person 's house that she did not know , and when she went upstairs to go to the restroom , she was raped by a man who claimed that he knew she was an informant			0
she went to the local hospital and asked for a rape kit to be performed but told police that she did not want them to pursue an investigation			0
in her mind , the @entity13 would carry out their own investigation since she was there as part of her undercover work			1
her supervisors immediately said that they would come to her defense - that they saw her ' like a sister ' and would hunt down the man responsible			0
as days went by , however , they stopped picking up her calls and she began to understand that they were building a case against her to charge that she made up her rape allegations			0
the @entity13 is now claiming that they had a discussion with her the night before her alleged sexual assault wherein they decided that they would formally ' cease ' the informant partnership			2
betrayed : ms @entity11 was first told that @entity13 would investigate her alleged rape but now they are charging her with crimes and have made no progress on her rape investigation , eight months later they issued a statement to that effect to @entity18 reporter last week in late february , but they never provided the paperwork that would have been filed at the time if that timeline were true			1
they went on to say that ' in like of the necessary investigative activities , her status as a victim ' she had her role as a confidential informant formally terminated on august 7			0
this was n't the first sign that they were going to go after her , however			0
just 12 days after the alleged assault , she was arrested by @entity13 for using marijuana			2
not long after , she was charged with @entity80 after marijuana was found in her car			1
those were n't the only charges filed against her : she was written up for wearing an unauthorized nail polish while in her dorm room			0
' once you have that target on your back it 's coming from everywhere			0
she â€™s causing them too much work , it 's too many problems , ' said @entity96 , a assault victim 's advocate who is also a retired @entity4 veteran			1
under watch : @entity11 was asked to dig for clues about the drug rings around the @entity101 and her supervisors told her not to do any drugs but she could drink and break other rules ; now they are charging her for that according to ms @entity11 , these are all steps that the @entity13 has taken to separate themselves from her and paint her in a bad light			1
the most important distinction is that she says she was not told to stop her 3 - month - long informant career only after the alleged rape			0
as for the charges , she does n't deny that they happened but does say that they are reneging on an earlier understanding by bringing them up			0
when she was first recruited to become an informant - which came after she went to report a different incident when another airman made an inappropriate sexual remark - she says that her supervisors said it would be okay if she partook in some typically banned behavior in order to gain the trust of the drug dealers			2
secrecy : the @entity13 at @entity31 near @entity32 , @entity33 has not revealed any evidence supporting their timeline of events , wherein they go against ms @entity11 and say that they told her to stop her confidential work the day before her alleged rape she told @entity18 that her @entity13 supervisor said : ' just dirty yourself			1
tell them you were a bad person before you joined the @entity4 , tell them you miss smoking weed , tell them you miss doing pills			2
' the alternative timeline from the @entity13 is the latest twist in the ongoing saga , and ms @entity11 is technically still enrolled in the weather program at @entity31 but she also still has the investigation looming over her head - an investigation that is different and separate from the drugs charges , for which she was sent to rehabilitation program			1
even though they have questioned her repeatedly , taken the rape kit results from the hospital and asked her for handwriting samples , they have still not told her what exactly they are investigating .			0

@entity11 was allegedly raped while at a party trying to gather information about drug rings near @entity31 in @entity33
she says she ended her undercover work the next day but her **superiors** put out a statement saying they cut ties the day before the attack
they did n't release any of the documentation that would have been filed at the time if she had been cut before the july 26 , 2013 attack
two weeks later , her former **superiors** arrested her for smoking pot , and later charged her with a @entity80 for having marijuana in her car
sexual assault advocate says this case is an example of how the @entity4 tries to cover up attacks - and smears the victim in the *aftermath*
