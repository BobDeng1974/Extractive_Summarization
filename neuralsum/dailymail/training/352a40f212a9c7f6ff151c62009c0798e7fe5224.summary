her let ’s move ! program has partnered with names like dr. @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 on 19 songs directed at children and teens at risk for obesity , but is curiously missing the likes of @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and others that have spent time at the @entity26			1

@entity33 : first lady @entity3 makes an appearance in a hip hop music video released by her let 's move ! program in collaboration with @entity39 and @entity40 the surprising lack of star power paved the way for @entity32 guard @entity44 to spit a few lines on one of the songs , according to the @entity48			2

the album is due out september 2013			1
singers such as @entity65 and @entity12 make appearances , as well as dr. @entity11 - yes , he 's rapping , or at least trying to - but one ca n't help wonder if @entity21 sent the call about this project straight to voice mail			1
this move is yet another in the first lady ’s campaign against childhood obesity , a condition that affects @entity78 children disproportionately to whites			2
it is estimated that 50 percent of @entity78 youths are obese			2

‘ we needed to develop an interventionary tool for the community			0
hip - hop was born as a platform to bring our interventions to the youth			2
’ then , this past june , the first video from the collaboration was released			0
called ‘ everybody , ’ the song features the music stylings of @entity12 , @entity13 , and others , along with cameos in the video from dr. @entity11 and @entity3 herself			1

in her appearance , @entity3 recalls the first days of her let ’s move program when people wondered if they could really make a difference in childhood obesity			0

' everybody ' : @entity13 and @entity12 sing about vegetables and staying positive in the first single from the album @entity57 called everybody once the videos are complete , @entity3 and her collaborators intend to distribute them to schools first in @entity118 and then in @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190 with the hope they 'll be played during recess or between periods			1
for his part , @entity90 believes @entity57 is going to be a winner , thanks in no small part to the way they ’ve chosen to reach out			0
‘ cultural leaders and visionaries in our country can give these messages to kids in a way that 's not preachy , ’ he said			0
‘ kids are going to be dancing and listening to the music			0
