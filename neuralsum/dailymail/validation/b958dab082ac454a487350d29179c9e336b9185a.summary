a lot of @entity2 ’s friends and fans are letting their hearts rule their heads and are making themselves look spectacularly naive			1
@entity2 was stunning again for @entity6 in @entity7			2
with a little bit of help from his friends – notably @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 – he has spearheaded the charge to the top of @entity16 @entity17 is arguably the luckiest manager in international football – @entity2 is shining for @entity6 at exactly the same time as the @entity19 has been expanded , and it would be a huge failure if @entity6 did n’t qualify for the finals in @entity23 next year			1
@entity17 is well on course to make history with his current squad			0
@entity2 scored two goals for @entity6 in @entity7 but has not been up to scratch for @entity28 this season @entity2 celebrates one of his two goals in @entity7 as @entity6 won their @entity32 qualifying match in @entity16 @entity2 has been brilliant for @entity6 but his form for @entity28 has left a lot to be desired in @entity35 international football should be the best of one country against another ... not a @entity41 playing for @entity35 , an @entity42 in @entity44 colours or an @entity46 - born @entity45 @entity48 's exciting squad and flawless form give real reasons for optimism ahead of @entity32 ... but only if @entity52 can instil a positive mentality but as brilliant as @entity2 has been for @entity6 , his form this season for @entity28 is still a subject for debate			1
he has n’t been good enough , and needs to step up to the plate between now and the end of the season to keep his reputation at the @entity63 intact			0
his supporters have expressed their disgust at anyone who dares to question @entity2 ’s @entity28 credentials			2
honestly , did these people think that @entity2 or any player for that matter , could go to a club the size of @entity28 and not be scrutinised ? it seems these people are unaware of the amazing history and traditions of this great club – and the demands that go with it			2
this is n’t the @entity82 national team , where a couple of goals in @entity7 makes you a national treasure			0
this is n’t @entity87 where reaching the quarter - finals of the @entity89 is a once - in - a - lifetime achievement			1
@entity28 's @entity91 vents his frustration next to team - mate @entity2 during a @entity94 match @entity2 has failed to meet the high standards at @entity28 this season in front of football 's harshest critics no , this is @entity28 , where they win their 10th @entity89 and immediately ask if the players are good enough to win it again the following season			1
where finishing behind @entity104 is almost regarded as a crime			2
where finishing third last season behind @entity109 and @entity104 was seen as utter humiliation			2
standards are spectacularly high at @entity28 and it ’s hard to make a case to support the notion that @entity2 has maintained the level he reached last season			2
as far as his @entity63 future is concerned , saturday ’s man - of - the - match display in @entity118 will have done nothing to appease the @entity121			0
in a @entity6 shirt @entity2 is everywhere – it ’s exhausting watching him			0
he scored two , he set up the other , he created more chances with some awesome passing			0
he ran at defenders , committing them , forcing fouls or mistakes from them			0
in short he was brilliant			0
compare that with the @entity2 who shrunk , disappeared ( dare i say hid ? ) in the @entity132 in the second half of @entity134 the week before			1
now you can see why @entity28 fans are so frustrated with @entity2			0
unless his form and impact changes at club level , @entity2 could be on the way out of @entity28 this summer			0
@entity2 scored recently against @entity142 to end a goal drought and covered his ears as if to mute the criticism @entity2 could be on the way out of @entity28 this summer if his form does not pick up by the end of the season the club demands big - name signings every summer and @entity2 ’s second - season slump may be enough to render him dispensable			1
it might seem harsh to some , but if you know how high the standards are at @entity28 , then it ’s perfectly normal			0
@entity2 should come back to the @entity156			1
he ’d be the perfect signing for @entity158 in so many ways , but he ’d also fit perfectly into @entity161 ’s way of thinking at @entity162			1
@entity164 ’s inertia in evolving their team could be tackled by the signing of @entity2			2
but @entity167 should blow the others out of the water – they have bargaining chips in @entity171 or possibly @entity172 who has struggled to settle after his blistering start			1
@entity2 has the energy to raise @entity167 ’s tempo and take them back to the big time			1
whatever happens to @entity2 he should feel proud of his achievements			0
he has helped create special history at @entity28 , and he ’s on the brink of doing the same for @entity6			0
@entity172 has struggled at @entity167 this season so far following his £ 59.7million move @entity167 goalkeeper @entity171 could be used as a bargaining chip for @entity2 to leave @entity28 this summer			1

@entity2 shrunk , disappeared and even hid against @entity104 last week
the former @entity87 star should return to the @entity156
@entity2 would be a perfect signing for @entity158 or @entity161 's @entity162
but @entity167 should blow the others out of the water
@entity192 has bargaining chips in @entity171 and @entity172
@entity195 : international football should not be about a @entity41 playing for @entity35 , an @entity198 in @entity44 colours or an @entity46 - born @entity45
