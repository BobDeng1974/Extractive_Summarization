trendy winter coat manufacturer @entity1 is being accused of being cruel to animals and covering up the truth about it , @entity0 can disclose			2
the hugely successful maker of fur - lined coats is the subject of legal action claiming that it has deliberately deceived consumers , exploited animal welfare concerns with disingenuous marketing and concealed the reality of chilling cruelty and animal suffering on which their multi-million dollar business is built			1
the shocking allegations are made against the manufacturer in a legal complaint filed against the company last week in @entity22			2
the complaint has been filed by @entity24 and calls for independent law enforcement agency the @entity25 of @entity22 to ' investigate @entity1 for its multiple intentional misrepresentations			1
it is unclear whether these images are from @entity1 trappers but the firm does use the same leg holds ugly : exhausted , alone and all out of fight , this @entity46 awaits its inevitable fate having been caught in a trap by its right hind leg fan following : @entity52 models one of the coats with coyote fur - lined hoods			1
the brand is diversifying into other apparel too , such as the down jacket worn by @entity60 ( right ) endorsed : the company is marketed by @entity63 celebrity @entity62 , who presents @entity62 's @entity64 and has spoken out on other animal cruelty issues including the killing of rhinos and the killing of zoo animals @entity1 has become one of the most recognizable brands when it comes to winter jacket , coats and parkas			1
they have made @entity77 their new frontier , forging into the @entity77 clothing market with worldwide sales topping $ 176 million last year - up 4,000 per cent in a decade			0
in november last year it opened its own store in @entity82 , one of @entity85 's most prestigious shopping areas , and it also sells at high - end stores such as @entity87 's , @entity88 , , @entity89 and @entity90			2
. earlier this year it opened a new factory in @entity92 to cope with soaring demand			0
celebrities are regularly seen wearing the trademark coyote fur - trimmed , down jackets and the brand has established itself as the go - to label for the well - known and the well - heeled braving the frigid conditions that continue to bite			1
last year 's @entity102 cover featured @entity103 wearing a @entity1 jacket and little else			2
other celebrities seen wearing the brand have included @entity60 , the @entity108 star , and @entity102 model @entity31			1
it is endorsed by @entity62 , the @entity63 animal television show presenter , who has also spoken out against animal cruelty			1
but according to the legal complaint , seen by @entity0 , consumers are being duped into thinking they are making either an ethical choice or buying the best product when they purchase @entity1			1
in the document @entity24 has accused the company of , ' engaging in a persistent pattern of using deceptive practices to market its winter jackets by repeatedly misleading consumers with respect to the nature and quality of its jackets which include coyote fur			1
' the complaint attacks @entity1 on its claims that the coyote fur used in its jackets is in any way ethically or humanely obtained			1
distressed : a coyote is caught in a snare of the same type used by @entity1 trappers snared : campaigners claim that coyotes caught like this can take days to die @entity1 's website claims that the company is ' deeply committed to the preservation of our global environment and the humane treatment of animals			1
' it goes on , ' we never purchase fur from fur farms , never use fur from endangered animals , and only purchase from certified @entity22 trappers			2
' these trappers are governed by the agreement on @entity155 ( @entity156 ) and their pelts are purchased by @entity1 through @entity158 ( @entity158 )			2
according to @entity22 goose the @entity158 ' monitors very closely ' the practices of the trappers selling through it			2
according to @entity24 it does nothing of the sort			0
instead , they claim : ' there is no mechanism within the @entity158 to provide any degree of oversight of the trapping practices of the trappers from which @entity158 accepts consignment pelts			0
' @entity158 , it states , does not monitor trappers			0
it is not an oversight body ; it is a commercial fur auction house			0
nor does the @entity156 bring the guarantee of humane methods explicit in @entity1 's claims			1
the @entity156 simply requires @entity22 to ' phase out ' certain types of traps – traps , @entity186 claims , that are still used by the trappers selling to @entity1			1
what @entity1 says : the faqs on the firm 's website form part of the animal rights group 's case against the successful manufacturer			1
they say that the trappers are not monitored to be sure that act humanely design classic : @entity1 's women 's @entity199 in military green in demand : the company predicts double digit sales growth for the foreseeable future and so while consumers believe every effort is being made to ensure that the fur they are wearing when they buy a @entity1 coat has been secured with minimal animal suffering and maximum human oversight , they are , @entity186 insists , being deceived			1
coyotes are caught in leg hold traps that inflict injuries including fractures , severance of tendons and ligaments , severe bleeding , spinal cord injury , organ damage and amputation of limbs			2
despite these horrific injuries the animal may survive long enough to be clubbed , suffocated or strangled to death by the @entity230 dispatch an animal swiftly with a bullet would spoil the pelt			0
body gripping traps and snares - metal nooses - are also used inflicting similar injury and failing to deliver the swift ' humane ' death implied in @entity1 's marketing material			1
the @entity239 , which promotes the interests of the fur industry , believes a ' humane ' death is on that occurs within 300 seconds			0
according to @entity186 : '			0
. under laboratory conditions , it takes approximately eight minutes … for a snare to strangle a coyote – three minutes longer than what even the fur industry itself claims to be humane			1
' as for the company 's assertion that they do not use the pelt of endangered species , @entity186 points out that the traps set for coyotes are indiscriminate in the animals they capture			2
marketing : @entity1 uses @entity22 's @entity259 to highlight the warmth of its jackets more fans : @entity263 ( left ) keeps warm in a @entity1 jacket while filming in @entity85 , while @entity265 wears one to run errands in the city @entity268 among @entity1 's defense of their use of real fur is their insistence that in , ' the coldest places on @entity275 … fur is not just the best choice , but the only choice			1
' speaking on their website , @entity278 , the president and ceo of @entity1 , explains : ' we use coyote fur for a number of reasons			1
number one , coyote fur works			1
it 's functional ; it provides warmth around the face in a way that no synthetic fabric can			0
it does that in the coldest environments in earth , and it 's important to realize that sometimes urban centers and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth			0
' we 're confident in both why we use fur and how it is sourced , and people should know this is not something we take lightly			0
our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products , how it is sourced , and the government - regulated practices of the @entity22 fur industry			1
like many proud @entity22 , we do n't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong			0
we understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that			0
we also understand that despite the fact that numerous brands also use real fur in their products and do not attempt to explain their position , it is our very openness and transparency around this subject that makes @entity1 a target for activist groups whose views will never align with ours			1
we are proud to support an industry practice that supports northern and rural communities in @entity22 , and of our continued role as an educator on this matter			2
the narrator then states : ' @entity46 fur , unlike fake fur , does n't hold moisture , retains heat and is biodegradable			0
' in its legal complaint @entity186 says : ' there is no scientific proof to support @entity1 's claim that coyote fur is more protective of the face , in a way that ' no synthetic material ' can be			1
' this is not the first time @entity1 has fallen foul of animal rights campaigners			1
last year @entity0 revealed that @entity356 ( @entity356 ) was calling for the company to stop using coyote fur and to stop supporting the trapping of animals , ' in a way that is inherently cruel			1
' speaking to @entity0 then @entity362 , director of campaigns for @entity356 described the horrific reality of animal trapping			0
she said : ' the company 's reference to @entity156 standards is meaningless and a way of placating and silencing people with valid concerns			0
' leg hold traps are still legal in @entity22			2
mothers will chew off their limbs in order to get back to their young			0
the trapped animal might be there for days before the trapper finds them			0
they are frightened and starving and in pain during that time			0
and then they 're bludgeoned or strangled to death			0
' additionally @entity356 has called for the company to replace its goose down – which is obtained as a by - product of the poultry industry - and opt for ' revolutionary synthetic technology ' already used by competitor , @entity391			0
but according to ms @entity394 's repeated attempts to meet with @entity1 have been stonewalled			2
now , @entity24 , has called for the @entity25 to investigate the company for its ' multiple intentional misrepresentations on its website			0
' and it has urged the body to ' take all appropriate enforcement action to ensure that @entity1 is accountable ' for the ' false and misleading information that it has willfully directed at consumers			0
' @entity1 said that it rejected any claims it had misinformed customers but said it could never satisfy activists entirely opposed to fur			1
a spokesman said : ' our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products , how it is sourced , and the government - regulated practices of the @entity22 fur industry			2
' like many proud @entity22 , we do n't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong			0
we understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that			0

*massively* successful brand is subject of legal case brought by animal rights activists in @entity22 over its use of coyote fur
group says @entity1 's claims that its fur is ethically trapped can not be true and wants @entity22 trade regulator to stop it making claims
animal activists say it takes eight minutes for coyotes to die when they are trapped in snares and that practice is *barbaric*
@entity1 says its fur is humanely trapped and vital to livelihood of *remote* communities - and says it will never see eye - to - eye with animal lobby
celebrities including @entity31 and @entity60 wear the brand and it is endorsed by @entity63 ' *adventurer* ' @entity62
