after a day - long lull in @entity3 ’s gold rush on friday , it appeared as if @entity4 may have had its fill of @entity7 glory			1
but yesterday morning at the rowing lake at @entity9 – the scene of so many gold - medal - winning triumphs for @entity13 oarsmen – the man they call ‘ the @entity16 of the water ’ had other ideas			1
on the final full day of competition at the @entity21 , @entity3 ’s ‘ human hydrofoil ’ @entity19 set the standard for another day of @entity4 success by storming to gold in the 200m sprint kayak			1
happy couple : @entity19 , with his fiance , @entity47 , a pe teacher the ‘ @entity56 roar ’ from the 20,000 - strong crowd thronging the banks drove on @entity19 – who is due to marry next month – as he blasted to the front of the world - class field of sprint kayakers , described as the sport ’s equivalent of @entity54			1
in winning @entity4 ’s 26th gold medal , @entity19 becomes only the second @entity60 in history to win the @entity7 title in the sport after @entity64 took gold in @entity66 four years ago			1
it put an end to a barren run on the lake for @entity3 ’s flat - water paddlers , who struggled to repeat last week ’s glorious successes enjoyed by the rowing squad which took gold in four events			1
‘ crossing the line was fantastic , ’ said @entity19 , a trainee accountant , who unlike @entity16 is no extrovert			1
‘ i ’m just so happy to contribute to the medal table			2
i thought i might struggle because i was light and more affected by the strong wind			2
‘ but i got a clean start			0
it was just relief at the end , not elation			0
i was so happy i could do it in front of the home crowd			0
’ @entity19 burst into an early lead and then held on to finish in a time of 36.2 seconds			0
he splashed the water and punched the air in jubilation as he crossed the line			0
a stiff wind in his face meant he could not match his @entity7 record time , which was more than second quicker , set in the heats			0
‘ i knew coming into this that i was ready , ’ he said			0
‘ i just wanted to go out and do my best race			1
if i did that , i knew i would come away with something			0
to come away with gold is brilliant			2
moment of glory : @entity3 's @entity19 punches the air after crossing the line first to win gold thumbs up : gold medallist @entity19 , who has been dubbed the ' @entity16 of the water ' , celebrates his win ‘ it was really painful down the last bit with that headwind			1
i was really just focused on the first two or three strokes , i wanted to nail those and hope the race sorted itself out and it did			2
the crowd helped to cheer me on			0
when they announced my name and i got a cheer , it made my hair stand on end			0
’ @entity19 has previously laughed off comparisons with @entity16 , but yesterday he said : ‘ i have the gold medal to go with it now , so i am more willing to accept that tag - line			2
’ with @entity7 glory secured , he can now focus on marrying his fiancee , pe teacher @entity126			0
@entity19 was a pupil at @entity128 comprehensive school in @entity129 on @entity130 , @entity131 , when he joined his first canoe club at 12			1
triumph : @entity19 dominated the race and crossed the line in 36.246 seconds five years later he took part in the @entity137 and by 19 he was part of the @entity4 senior team			1
‘ it was one of those things – you do a few races and you realise you are quite good at it			0
winning races is quite infectious , ’ he said			0
he was training to compete in the 500m @entity7 event when it was dropped in 2009 in favour of the 200m sprint			1
the shorter , more explosive race suited him and a year later he was the @entity151 and @entity152 in the discipline			2
since then he has finished on the podium in every international event he has raced in			0
victory : @entity19 won @entity3 's second canoe sprint @entity7 gold , following @entity160 's triumph in 2008 video : @entity19 on winning gold in the 200m sprint kayak at the @entity32 ...			1
