she waited 36 years to visit her daughter 's grave			1
now @entity3 has finally been able to pay her respects , by becoming one of the first people to visit a small , windswept island where a million souls are buried			1
tonight her emotional story will feature in a documentary on @entity11 , the final resting place for @entity14 's still - born babies , the homeless and the unclaimed where 1,500 fresh corpses arrive each year			1
access is severely restricted , photos are banned and burials are performed en masse without tombstones by prison inmates			1
each white plastic pipe near the building marks an infant mass gravesite , one plastic pipe per 1,000 babies @entity41 : a sailboat passes behind an abandoned building on @entity11 , east of the @entity44 in november , the 59 - year - old nurse became one of eight women to be granted permission to visit after a fierce campaign to stop the dead being omitted from history			1
her daughter @entity52 was born two months prematurely in 1978 and lived for just five days , weighing a fragile 4lb 2oz			1
but she could not be there when @entity52 suffered heart failure , because a snowstorm cut off her route to the hospital			1
by the time she got there , her daughter 's body was already gone			2
ms @entity3 told @entity64 's @entity63 , writing in the @entity65 : ' they said , " the body ’s already gone			1
you signed the forms so that the @entity69 will bury her but do n’t worry because the @entity69 buries them with all of the other babies and stillborns			2
" ' anyone who ’s a parent , knows that you simply ca n’t let it go – it ’s a part of you			0
' at first , she was told only that her baby was buried in @entity78			0
later she would discover this was not the name of a real place , but a common term for a pauper 's grave			2
it comes from biblical times , in which clay fields would be useless for agriculture and used for burying people instead			0
history : @entity11 , at just 131 acres , has had many uses - including as a homelessness and alcoholism rehabilitation centre in the 1950s ( pictured )			1
but its solitary jetty is now surrounded by barbed wire long history : inmates of now - derelict @entity98 bury bodies of people poisoned by wood alcohol trench : this photo from 1990 shows a mass burial trench for adults			1
pine boxes used as coffins can be seen city limits : just within the boundaries of the @entity44 , @entity11 is tucked away from the view of most people once they arrive at @entity11 , corpses are interred in great , anonymous trenches			1
there are no tombstones and small white posts in the ground mark each 150 adult bodies			2
a thousand children and infants are buried together per grave , stacked three coffins deep			0
the island is run by the @entity123 and the men who do the digging are convicts from @entity126 , petty offenders tasked with carrying bodies to their final resting place			1
but it lay largely forgotten until artist @entity131 began a campaign to revive interest in its secrets			2
she began the @entity135 , mapping the 131 - acre island 's burial sites and collection stories from people whose relatives were buried there			1
by now she has helped around 500 people from as far afield as @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and the @entity146 , and listed more than 60,000 burials in the project 's database			0
she told mr @entity63 : ' they line them up sort of like @entity153 unloading boxes ... a morgue truck arrives and it ’s full of coffins			0
especially if it ’s baby coffins , where there are 50 or 60 at once			0
' pain : after a 36 - year wait , @entity3 became one of the first eight women to visit @entity11 ( pictured in the background ) , a mass graveyard for a million paupers and still - born babies off the coast of @entity14 poignant : @entity3 's baby girl lived for just four days , with these footprints among the few mementos closure : @entity3 lays flowers on the spot where her daughter @entity52 was buried in a mass grave not forgotten : @entity131 of the @entity135 holds a large transparency of a photograph by @entity179 of infant coffins on @entity11			1
in the background are pictures of the ' baby trench ' never forget : these displays by @entity131 of the @entity135 and photographer @entity179 show a grave marker of the first child on the island to die of @entity188 close up : this picture shows @entity190 , whose baby was buried on @entity11 many years ago			1
the image is part of a collaborative work by @entity135 's @entity131 and photographer @entity179 heartbreaking : blankets with names , cause of death and date of death , created by @entity131			0
the story of @entity3 , who visited her daughter 's grave after 36 years , will be shown tonight on @entity203 first used as a cemetery in the @entity205 , @entity11 was used as a training camp , a prison for captured @entity208 , a workhouse , a mental asylum and a @entity212 missile base			1
it has just one jetty , which is closed to the public and surrounded by railings , barbed wire and spikes			0
prison authorities long banned visits on the basis that the island 's buildings were dilapidated , abandoned and potentially dangerous			2
under pressure , they finally began allowing visits in 2007			0
but those attending would only be able to stand in a gazebo far from the graves themselves			0
once @entity3 arrived last month , she broke down in tears			2
' i ca n't say i found closure , ' she said			0
' when you lose a child , there really is never closure			0
there is a piece of you that is gone			0
' ' i did find solace in that there was water surrounding it and there was a lovely view			0
' she was even allowed to take a photograph			0
