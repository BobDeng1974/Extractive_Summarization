by @entity1 reporter published : 14:38 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 13 november 2013 when @entity3 called last orders at @entity5 , she had one fairly pressing problem - what to do with all ye olde teapots			1
because as well as the ones she actually used to make tea , mrs @entity3 had also collected a few extras , just for decoration purposes			1
about 1,000 extras in fact - in every conceivable shape and size			2
former tea shop owner @entity3 with 1,000 strong collection of teapots during her 14 years in business in @entity21 , @entity22 , she amassed teapots in all shapes and sizes which jockeyed for position on shelves and mantel pieces			1
now she is hoping that someone will take on the collection rather than having to box them up and put them in storage			2
' when my partner @entity35 and i moved here there was one white papier mache teapot on display in the window and it looked awful , ' she said			2
' i tried putting plants there but that did n't look right either , so i started collecting teapots from charity shops and car boot sales and anywhere else i saw them			2
i have got teapots like ducks , fish , chickens , cats , mice , pigs and a horse			0
' none of them are particularly valuable - although there is an original 17th century @entity60 one which is worth about £ 200			0
i do have some favourites - like a leopard print one and a fishing basket one and one that looks like the @entity67 train			1
i never used them to serve tea , they were just ornaments			0
' mrs @entity3 is moving out of the old fashioned shop , which has a 16th century wall painting , because she says trade has been hit by a combination of factors including the recession , competition from trendy new coffee shops and the fact that the @entity80 has taken @entity21 off the map by failing to signpost it from the main @entity83 from @entity84			1
weird and wonderful designs feature in mrs @entity3 ' teapot collection and she seems to have every style from a packing box ( left ) to a cuckoo clock ( right ) from a tea pot featuring silent film star @entity91 ( left ) , to an unusual kitchen inspired pot , mrs @entity3 has something in her collection for every interest or taste ' when we first came here there were five or six coaches and all their passengers every week and even some through the winter when shopping tours stopped here			1
now we are lucky if we get one a week			0
' there used to be just four shops like ours in the town but now there are lots more and it is inevitable we ca n't all survive			0
' we kept thinking business would pick up but it reached the stage where we just could n't carry on			0
we worked out we had to make £ 450 a day to break even and at times we have been down to the £ 200 to £ 300s			0

@entity3 is looking for a good home for her 1,000 strong collection
@entity5 is closing its doors after 14 years in @entity21
favourite pots feature leopard print and @entity67 designs
