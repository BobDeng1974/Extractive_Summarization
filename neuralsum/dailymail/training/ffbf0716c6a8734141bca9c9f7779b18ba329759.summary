after finding the net twice in his first two matches for @entity3 , perhaps @entity0 was checking that his goal bonus had been paid in			1
the £ 32m striker was snapped at a cash machine in @entity7 , not far from @entity8 , just hours after setting the @entity9 on their way to victory over @entity12			1
the picture was posted on @entity14 by a @entity3 fan and quickly went viral			2
he was later spotted at a cash machine in @entity7 flying start : @entity0 celebrates his goal against @entity12 , breaking the @entity8 deadlock on 62 minutes debut goal : @entity0 had also scored on his first @entity27 start at @entity28 on monday night still dressed in a @entity3 training top and tracksuit bottoms , the @entity29 cut a conspicuous figure as he checked his balance			1
he had spared @entity3 from a frustrating afternoon against the newly - promoted side , breaking the deadlock just after the hour mark , before @entity37 made sure of the points with 13 minutes left			1
@entity0 , signed from @entity39 , opened his account at @entity28 in monday 's 3 - 1 win , and his manager @entity42 has been impressed by the speed of the @entity46 - born forward 's transition			1
' i got the feeling in pre-season that his adaptation would not be a big deal , he is an easy guy , ' said @entity42			0
' his style of play has adapted to our needs , so it has not been a problem			0
' impressed : @entity42 has been pleased with the way @entity0 has adapted to @entity59 football but @entity42 was not impressed with his side 's slow start to the match			2
he said : ' i prefer to train in the morning , but this week i trained in the afternoon because this is not the best weather to play football , you get lazy			0
' this weather pushes players to be a bit lazy , to lose a bit of tension , a bit of sharpness in your body , after that you pass slow , you do not react to the second balls , the time goes on and on , then when you wake up , it is half - time			2
stand off : @entity0 holds off the challenge of @entity12 's @entity78 during saturday 's match ' in the first half , the team was lazy , and i did not like that			1
' but they improved in the second half and they won , which is the most important thing			0
' at half - time , we had to be a bit emotional with them			0
i told them the way we were playing was not good enough to win the game and that we were at risk			0
' it is impossible to play football if you do not win one second ball , it was basic but important things			0
' @entity3 , who top the table after the first two matches , travel to @entity103 next .			2
