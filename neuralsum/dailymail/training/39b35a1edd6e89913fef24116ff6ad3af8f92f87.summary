by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 10 august 2013 @entity1 has changed the ending to its upcoming ‘ @entity4 ’ sequel			2
in response to the controversy surrounding ‘ @entity10 , ’ a documentary about @entity9 orcas , @entity1 reportedly rewrote the ending to ‘ finding @entity4 , ’ the much - anticipated sequel to the box office smash ‘ @entity4			1
’ the movie ’s ending reportedly involved a marine park similar to @entity9 before being modified			1
finding @entity4 : the sequel to ' @entity4 ' has been reworked in response to public outcry over the treatment of orcas at @entity9 after the release of the ' @entity10 ' documentary as a result of the sometimes harsh ‘ @entity10 ’ … and the resulting publicity battle @entity9 has had to fight , @entity1 decided to restructure that part of the story so that the fish and mammals taken to its aquatic center have the option to leave , ’ the @entity23 reported			1
though it ’s not uncommon for movie scripts to change prior to the final cut , it is uncommon for plot changes to be made public before the premiere			1
the notoriously secretive @entity1 is known to keep quiet about films until they are ready for release , according to the @entity23 , which noted that this reported change is the only known part of the story line			0
‘ @entity10 ’ has caused a raft of problems for @entity9 since its release earlier this year			2
the documentary tells the tale of @entity49 , the orca who caused the 2010 death of trainer @entity53 , according to @entity54			0
the film then delves into how @entity9 treats its stable of orcas , also known as killer whales , portraying the park as exploiting the giant orcas			1
@entity10 , the film ’s director did n’t expect it to have as big an impact			0
‘ i do n't have one end goal for this film , ’ @entity10 told @entity54 " i did n't want the film to ever feel like it was telling you what to do or how to feel ... if you were moved by it , that feeling is yours			0
’ @entity10 : killer whales swim in a tank at @entity9 in @entity74 , @entity75 the beleaguered marine park lashed out at the film friday in a written statement			1
‘ @entity10 is billed as a documentary , but instead of a fair and balanced treatment of a complex subject , the film is inaccurate and misleading and , regrettably , exploits a tragedy that remains a source of deep pain for @entity53 's family , friends and colleagues , ’ the statement said			0
‘ to promote its bias that killer whales should not be maintained in a zoological setting , the film paints a distorted picture that withholds from viewers key facts … that @entity9 rescues , rehabilitates and returns to the wild hundreds of wild animals every year , and that @entity9 commits millions of dollars annually to conservation and scientific research , ’ the statement continued			2
the rebuttal was the latest in a back and forth between the filmmaker and @entity9 , which has even seen the theme park chain release a series of objections to the film that were then posted to the documentary 's website and addressed on an individual basis			2
despite the bickering , @entity1 has green - lit the script change			0
the film is due out in 2015 .			0

the sequel originally *included* a marine park similar to @entity9
