by @entity0 @entity3 staff have been awarded more than £ 25million in bonuses since the start of the credit crunch , it emerged yesterday			1
the payments have been handed out despite the fact that governor sir @entity9 and his top team failed to anticipate the global financial crisis , and did nothing to prevent the @entity14 interest - rate rigging scandal			1
figures yesterday showed that the level of payouts actually increased last year by £ 200,000 to £ 4.9million – as @entity18 returned to recession			2
gloom : executives at the @entity3 have received bonuses of up to £ 30,000 despite governor sir @entity9 and his staff failing to predict the credit crunch or the libor interest - rate scandal one mp called the taxpayer - funded sums ‘ rewards for failure ’			1
over the past five years , thousands of @entity3 executives have received up to £ 30,000 in performance - related pay			1
the awards , handed out between when the credit crunch began in 2007 and this year , have totalled £ 25.3million			1
they come on top of generous salaries which exceed £ 150,000 a year for some of the @entity3 ’s senior staff			2
however , sir @entity9 , his deputies and members of the committee which set interest rates , are not among those who have received the extra money			2
@entity45 mp @entity44 said paying bonuses to their staff when the @entity3 has performed so badly sets ‘ a terrible example to commercial banks ’ , which have been accused of paying too much in bonuses			1
he added : ‘ they [ the @entity3 ] should be leading the way in creating a new banking culture , not leading the way in paying excessive bonuses			0
’ sir @entity9 has had to revise the @entity3 ’s economic forecasts a dozen times since the credit crunch began , most recently on wednesday , when he downgraded a previous 0.8 per cent growth prediction to zero			1
last month the @entity3 injected an additional £ 50 billion into the economy through its quantitative easing programme bringing the total stock to £ 375billion mr @entity44 , a member of the @entity64 select committee , added : ‘ it beggars belief that they could be paying bonuses at this time			1
they failed to pick up on the libor scandal , they failed to pick up on other wrong - doings			0
‘ they have failed to properly analyse what is happening in the economy			0
it is totally wrong that they should be rewarded for failure			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity3 defended the bonuses			0
she said : ‘ our staff are on a two - year pay freeze which began in 2011			0
‘ bonus payments are based on individual performance			0
the pot has been frozen at 6 per cent of the total salary bill for the past three years			0
average awards for the past five years have been between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000			0

thousands of bank executives have received bonuses of up to £ 30,000 in performance related bonuses
comes days after governor @entity9 warned a *recovery* for the economy is still years away and slashed its growth forecast for the year to zero
@entity45 mp @entity44 said it *'s* wrong bankers are rewarded for failure
@entity103 chief said it should have done more when credit crunch *struck* five years *ago*
