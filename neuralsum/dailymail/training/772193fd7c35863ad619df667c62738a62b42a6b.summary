it is the moment a lifetime of scientific research is proved to be true - and could lead to a @entity3			1
researchers at @entity5 today posted a video in which they revealed just how a leading physicist reacted when he was told his theory had been proved correct on a groundbreaking experiment that has changed the face of physics			1
it shows assistant professor @entity13 visiting the home of professor @entity15 , known as the ' father of inflation '			1
scroll down to see the video @entity19 ! assistant professor @entity20 surprises professor @entity21 with evidence that supports cosmic inflation theory			1
once the surprise has sunk in , the pair celebrate the ' spectacular ' discovery with champagne			0
scientists view the the universe as being made up of a ' fabric of space - time '			2
this corresponds to @entity34 's @entity33 which was published 1916			0
objects in the universe bend this fabric , and more massive objects bend it more			0
gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric			1
they can be produced for instance , when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies			0
gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the @entity48			1
' i 'm going to tell him our experiment has found the smoking gun evidence of inflation , ' says @entity13 , one of the team that today announced the discovery			2
' i have a surprise for you , ' he tells the professor , known as the ' father of inflation ' for his work on the subject , before explaining the team has proved his theory			1
' what ? can you repeat it again ? , ' the stunned scientists tells him			0
the discovery reveals what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the @entity48			2
this is a very brief moment of time at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded very rapidly - a theory called cosmic inflation first devised by @entity83			2
according to @entity34 when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves '			1
gravitational waves from inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background , which is the afterglow of the afterglow of the @entity48 scientists , from left , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity13 - @entity13 and @entity101 smile during a news conference at the @entity103 in @entity104 to announce their groundbreaking results the theory suggests that this intial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble			1
' it 's just unbelievable quite honestly , ' professor @entity114 , who helped build the instrument that detected the waves , told @entity117			1
' this is confirming what is , to me , a wacky idea			0
the next step is quite clear ; to confirm the data with another technology			0
' this graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the @entity48 to now			1
@entity128 scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth the finding by the @entity136 telescope ( pictured ) in the @entity137 could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years researchers at the @entity141 for astrophysics in @entity143 built super-sensitive radiation detectors and installed them in the @entity136 radio telescope at the @entity137 to find these ' ripples in the sand			1
' nine years later they found these swirling patterns in cosmic background radiation created by the gravitational waves caused by the very beginnings of the universe			1
many scientists already believed that an initial , extremely rapid growth spurt happened , but finding this evidence has been a key goal in the study of the universe			0
the results have been described as ' spectacular ' , and are expected to result in a @entity3 for the scientists the discovery gives us a window on the universe at the very beginning when it was far less than one - trillionth of a second old			1
the work still has to be reviewed by other scientists , but there is already talk of a @entity3			1
' it 's what 's i would term @entity3 winning physics , ' continued professor @entity114			1
' just who that prize goes to , however , will be up for debate			0
' microwave radiation from the whole sky , captured by the @entity184 's @entity183 satellite			0
astronomers today announced that they have found ' primordial gravitational waves ' - an echo of the @entity48 in which the universe came into existence 14bn years ago			1
according to @entity34 when something very explosive like this happens it leaves ripples in space - time known as ' gravitational waves ' a telescope at the south pole , called @entity136 ( @entity198 of cosmic @entity199 ) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves			1
the instrument , which scans the sky from the @entity137 , examines what is called the cosmic microwave background , the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe			0
the background radiation is not precisely uniform			0
like light , the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space			0
computer models predicted a particular curl pattern in the background radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe 's inflation after the big bang			2
it did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation			0
this is radiation that was created in the @entity48 and originally discovered in 1964			2
@entity136 measured the large - scale polarisation of this microwave radiation			1
only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern , and only if they have been amplified by inflation			1
‘ it 's just amazing , ’ added theoretical physicist @entity233 of @entity235 , who was not involved in the work			0
‘ you can see back to the beginning of time			0
’ another outside expert , physicist @entity241 of the @entity242 , said the finding already suggests that some ideas about the rapid expansion of the universe can be ruled out			0
right after the @entity48 , the universe was a hot soup of particles			2
it took about 380,000 years to cool enough that the particles could form atoms , then stars and galaxies			0
billions of years later , planets formed from gas and dust that were orbiting stars			0
the universe has continued to spread out			0
professor @entity233 said he thinks the new finding could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years , such as the @entity3 - winning discovery that the universe 's expansion is accelerating			1
the new results were announced by a collaboration that includes researchers from the @entity103 , the @entity268 , @entity5 , the @entity269 and @entity128 ’s @entity270			0
the team plans to submit its results to a scientific journal this week , said its leader , @entity101 of @entity103			0
this image shows temperature fluctuations , indicated by variations in colour , of the cosmic microwave background ( @entity280 )			2
researchers say since the @entity280 is a form of light , it exhibits all the properties of light , including polarisation ( shown by black lines )			0
the changes in polarisation are thought to be caused by gravitational waves the 14 - billion - year - long history of our universe			1
it shows the main events that occurred between the initial phase of the cosmos -- where its properties were almost uniform and punctuated only by tiny fluctuations - to the cosmic structure that we see today , ranging from stars and planets to galaxies and galaxy clusters a telescope at the south pole , called @entity136 ( @entity198 of cosmic @entity199 ) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves			1
@entity136 is shown here in the foreground with the @entity313 in the background for their research , astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the @entity137 , chosen for its very dry air , to aid in the observations			2
they were looking for a specific pattern in light waves within the faint microwave glow left over from the @entity48			1
the pattern has long been considered evidence of the rapid growth spurt , known as inflation			2
professor @entity101 called it ‘ the smoking gun signature of inflation			2
’ the scientists said the light - wave pattern was caused by gravitational waves , which are ripples in the interweaving of space and time that sprawls through the universe			1
the @entity136 telescope 's focal plane uses novel technology , developed at @entity128 's @entity270 , to build an array of devices that use superconductivity to gather , filter , detect , and amplify polarised radiation from the cosmic microwave background			1
each pixel is made from a printed antenna sensitive to polarised millimeter - wave radiation a full - sky map of the oldest light in the universe			0
colors indicate ' warmer ' ( red ) and ' cooler ' ( blue ) spots			0
@entity128 has called this image the best baby picture of the @entity355 ever taken if confirmed , the new work would be the first detection of such waves from the birth of the universe , which have been called the first tremors of the @entity48			1
@entity235 's @entity233 cautioned that it 's possible that the light - wave pattern is not a sign of inflation , although he stressed it 's ' extremely likely ’ that it is			2
it 's ‘ our best hope ’ for a direct test of whether the rapid growth spurt happened , he added			0
professor @entity233 and other experts said the results must be verified by other observations - a standard caveat in science			0
@entity376 , a theoretical physicist at @entity377 who did n't participate in the work , called the detection of the light - wave pattern ‘ huge news ’ for the study of the cosmos			2
‘ it 's not every day you wake up and learn something completely new about the early universe , ’ he said .			0

using the @entity136 telescope , scientists looked at specific patterns in light waves within the faint microwave glow left from the @entity48
they found pattern which they believe was caused by gravitational waves
video shows professor @entity15 , known as the ' father of inflation ' , being told his theory has been proved correct
work has to be reviewed , but there is already there is talk of a @entity3 prize
