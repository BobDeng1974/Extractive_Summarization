if he feels that the ball boys are deliberately acting in an unsporting way he can dispense with their services , as he can if he feels they are acting differently for the two teams involved			2
clearly , he did not feel this was the case and from what i saw i felt he was right — just like @entity3 did after the match and before his mischievous side got the better of him .			0
