by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 18:32 est , 14 august 2013 the amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades			2
the setback follows three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to a crawl			1
the @entity10 revealed that in the past year the amount of recycled material produced by the average individual in @entity14 actually fell , from 186kg ( 410lb ) per person to 185kg ( 407.8lb )			2
after three years in which the growth in household rubbish recycling had slowed to a crawl , the amount of rubbish each of us recycled went down last year for the first time in three decades no similar fall has been recorded since the early 1980s			1
the amount recycled by each individual more than doubled between 2004 – when fortnightly bin collections were introduced – and 2011			1
the department admitted earlier this year that published recycling figures are already ‘ overestimates ’ as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used			1
instead the rejected rubbish is sent to landfill or incinerators			0
between 2004 and 2010 recycling rates in @entity14 more than doubled , from 17.8 per cent of all the household waste collected to 39.7 per cent			0
the improvement from 2010 to 2012 was much slower , raising the recycling rate to 43 per cent			0
much of this improvement has been caused by the reduction in the amount of rubbish left out , a result of council restrictions on collections			0
@entity10 admitted earlier this year that published recycling figures were ' overestimates ' as a high proportion of material is too contaminated to be used the amount of household waste collected in @entity14 , including recycling material , has fallen from 25.7million tons in 2005 to 22.9million last year			1
total weight of recycling material collected from homes went up by just 1.25 per cent in the 12 months to march 2012 , from 9.7 million tonnes to 9.8 million tonnes			0
the recycling figures worked out according to how much recycling is produced by each individual take into account the effect on rubbish collections of the country ’s fast - rising population			2
numbers of people in the country have been going up by around 400,000 a year since 2005 .			0
