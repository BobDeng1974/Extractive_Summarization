by @entity0 it 's a long way from the sunny beach - loving holiday destination that @entity5 tour operators like to project to the thousands of @entity7 who descend on the island every year			0
a 16 - minute video was uploaded to @entity11 on wednesday showing various breeds of dogs held to the ground and given a lethal injection by @entity5 officers			1
the footage shows how dogs ' illegally smuggled ' into the country are given a lethal injection before being thrown onto a pile			1
this is part of a ' legally endorsed program ' by the governor of @entity25 and the @entity26 to tackle the risk of a rabies plague from the increasing number of stray and smuggled dogs			1
and in one shot , a female official can be seen smiling and taking photos of an animal just before it is put to its death			0
the @entity11 user who uploaded the video says the dogs are killed with an intracardiac injection , also known as a heart stick			1
this procedure involves sticking a needle into the animals ' hearts			0
' in @entity25 frightened smuggled dogs for the black market are held in cages and forced to watch others killed by lethal injection , ' he wrote in the video description			1
@entity25 , one of @entity7 's top holiday destinations , has more than 900,000 @entity7 visitors each year			2
the @entity78 reported that in april about 31 expensive breeds , including a @entity81 husky , a pomeranian and a @entity83 , were euthanised			2
they are worth hundreds of millions of rupiah , equivalent to thousands of @entity7 dollars			0
they were smuggled on a bus traveling from @entity89 to @entity25			1
it was also reported that dogs were captured by authorities when no one claimed ownership after 24 hours			2
a 16 minute @entity11 video shows @entity5 officers holding dogs as they are given a lethal injection dogs are being culled in @entity25 as a way to tackle the risk of a rabies plague from the increasing number of stray and smuggled dogs a petition on @entity106 is urging @entity25 governor made @entity108 to eliminate the inhumane culling program ' the sadistic scene involving innocent dogs whose only crime is being homeless and suspected to have " rabies "			1
' there is no compassion from the killers			0
' thrown into a pile the killers can be heard talking and laughing with no regard to the pain and suffering going on around them			0
loving dogs treated as garbage instead of faithful companions who only wanted to be loved			0
' the @entity126 reported that mass vaccinations have also been held , targeting more than 300,000 dogs each time			1
@entity25 governor made @entity108 was quoted saying that any stray dogs should be killed immediately as part of the 2009 rabies prevention bylaw			1
this was created to prevent people from being bitten by stray rabid dogs			2
' if any stray dogs are found , feel free to eliminate them , ' mr @entity108 said last month			1
' it has been stipulated in the bylaw that dog owners have to confine their pets at home			0
' a @entity143 spokeswoman says they 've previously worked with the @entity145 ( @entity146 ) and the @entity148 government to end the mass culling of dogs			0
' @entity56 strongly condemns the slaughter seen in this video			0
dogs are clearly terrified and stressed , no attempt is made to administer lethal injection via iv methods ( the only humane form of euthanasia ) and there is no reason why these dogs can not be vaccinated rather than slaughtered			0
' ' since 2010 , a successful vaccination program and the number of humans becoming infected with rabies has fallen dramatically , ' the spokeswoman said			0
' it is unclear why the @entity5 governor has decided to revert to a policy of killing all stray dogs in the face of an extremely successful anti-rabies vaccination program and against all specialist advice			2
a petition on @entity106 is urging mr @entity108 to shut down his elimination programs and suggests more humane ways of controlling increasing numbers .			1
