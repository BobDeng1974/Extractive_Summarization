a video has revealed the gruesome step - by - step process that takes place when you die			1
from your bodily functions shutting down to the process of embalming to make you presentable for your funeral , all of the gruesome details are discussed			1
the video was created by the @entity11 on @entity13 channel reactions			1
it explains the bodily functions that shut down after death			1
when blood stops circulating it pools in your body due to gravity ( shown ) your cells begin to die			1
this makes your body bacteria and fungi start to decompose your body it begins : ‘ let ’s say hypothetically that you were to just slump over dead in your chair right now , so what happens next ? ’ first , according to the narrator , your heart stops pumping so the flow of blood around your body ceases			1
this causes it to coagulate , forming clots and becoming thick and lumpy			0
it also gets pulled down by the force of gravity in a process called post-mortem hypostasis or livor mortis			2
‘ without circulation your body temperature also drops and your muscles stiffen in a process known as rigor mortis , ’ the narrator continues			0
this also stops you breathing , which means no oxygen gets to your cells			2
this prevents mitochondria in cells making @entity60 , a chemical used for many tasks , and ultimately they too die			1
they results in the release of enzymes such as @entity68 enzymes , which create an environment that is very attractive to bacteria and fungi			2
these begin to decompose and putrify your body			1
‘ before you ’re buried or cremated your family may want a funeral , ’ says the narrator			0
‘ to slow down the decomposition process and keep you looking tidy chemistry comes in handy via a process called embalming			1
’ ‘ the embalming process happens in two steps			0
first , your body is going to be loaded full of conservative chemicals like formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde using a pump and your circulatory system			1
first your heart stomps pumping , so the flow of blood around your body stops			2
this causes the blood to coagulate , forming clots and becoming thick and lumping			0
your muscles then stiffen in a process known as rigor mortis , which also stops you breathing and means no oxygen gets to your cells			2
your cells thus too begin to die , releasing enzymes that make your body very welcoming to bacteria and fungi			1
these decompose and putrify your body and ultimately , within a year or so , most of the flesh on your body will have decomposed leaving just your bones behind			1
to stop your body decomposing this scientists can pump you full of chemicals - called embalming			1
this keep you presentable for about a week such as for your funeral ( stock image of cemetery in @entity114 shown )			2
but ultimately your body will decompose to bones in a year or so dissolving dead bodies to create a brown , foul - smelling syrup may sound gruesome , but that ’s exactly what some people are hoping to happen to them once they pass away			1
the process is called alkaline hydrolysis and was developed more than two decades ago to get rid of animal carcasses			0
it ’s a more efficient and environmentally - friendly of getting rid of dead bodies , according to scientists			2
alkaline hydrolysis uses lye , 300 ° c heat and huge amounts of pressure to destroy bodies in big stainless - steel cylinders that look similar to pressure cookers			0
the process involves submerging the body in a solution of water and potassium hydroxide , which is then pressurised and heated for two - and - a - half to three hours			2
this leaves a green - brown tinted liquid containing amino acids , peptides , sugars and salts and soft , porous white bone remains which are easily crushed			0
because of its environmental advantages , some in the funeral industry say it could someday rival burial and cremation			0
it also eliminates concerns about crematorium emissions , including carbon dioxide , which can be released into the air as part of the process			0
‘ next all your stomach contents get sucked out and all the dark nether regions touched by the circulatory system are filled up with the same chemicals			0
‘ the embalming process allows your body to be displayed and buried without decomposing , but the process is only temporary ; eventually your body will again decompose , usually in a week or so			1
the awful smell that comes from a dead body comes from two particular chemical bioproducts , putrescine and cadaverine , which ‘ smell absolutely disgusting ’ according to the narrator			0
other bad smelling compounds include dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl trisulfide , which both contain sulphur , that ‘ reek like rotten egg and skunk			0
’ these bioproducts also , together with many other gases , make your body extremely bloated as the decomposition process continues			0
ultimately , within a year , most of the flesh on your body will have decomposed - and in 40 to 50 years your bones will be dry and brittle , but can last for hundreds of years			1
one common misconception , though , is also that hair and fingernails continue growing after death			0
as explained in the video this is not the case , but rather it just seems this way because skin contracts when it is dehydrated , making them seem to grow			0
‘ so hopefully now you ’ve got a good sense of what happens when you can sense no more , ’ the video concludes .			0
