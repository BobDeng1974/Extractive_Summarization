by @entity0 for @entity1 this is the amusing moment when a young couple stunned their family and friends when they did the ice bucket challenge on their wedding day @entity9 , 24 , and husband @entity10 , 21 , from @entity11 , were cheered on by guests as they got drenched to raise money for charity moments after tying the knot			1
they surprised their guests by announcing they were going to do the popular challenge after their ceremony on saturday			2
mrs @entity9 , who has two children from a previous relationship , wore her £ 450 dress and veil for the challenge while her groom was wearing his wedding suit complete with tie and waistcoat			1
now the blushing bride has revealed that their efforts have raised £ 180 for the @entity50			0
' we were nominated to do the challenge by my sister - in - law @entity52 the day before we got married , ' she added			2
' we kept it a surprise from the guests so they only found out when my brother @entity57 announced it during his speech			0
' some people told me i was mad to do it in my wedding dress but i was only going to wear it once so i did n’t mind			1
as guests counted down , mrs @entity9 , still in her veil , was soaked with icy water by sister - in - law , @entity68 , 35 , leaving her to spend the rest of the wedding with wringing wet hair			1
although she did bring a change of clothes , she says she was left uncomfortably cold			0
' everyone said they could n’t believe i went through with it but i said i was going to do it so i did , ' she added			0
the couple now hope their example will by followed by other brides and grooms			2
' i want to thank everyone who donated money on the day , ' said mr @entity23 , a supermarket worker , ' and i would definitely recommend the challenge to all couples who are getting married			2
' @entity9 did n’t actually tell me about she was planning for us to do it on our wedding day so i only found out during the speeches			1
i was really surprised she was willing to do it in her dress but i was happy to go along with it			0
' unfortunately that meant i did n’t have a change of smart clothes so i had to get changed into a pair of joggers afterwards			0
amusing : the pair laugh after completing the challenge but only mrs @entity9 had a change of clothes drying off : although mrs @entity9 had a change of clothes , mr @entity23 had to wear a pair of jogging bottoms ' we had no idea we would be doing something like this on our wedding day			1
everyone had a great time though and it was all for a good cause			0
mrs @entity68 , who nominated the pair , added : ' it was really brave of @entity9 to do the challenge in her wedding dress			1
' it is not something i would do but she was really up for doing it			0
the dress was completely soaked through so she had to leave it in a bathtub to let it dry			0
” mrs @entity9 , who works as a barista at @entity126 , met her husband 14 months ago and he proposed in november by hiding post-it notes around the house to create a treasure hunt .			1

@entity9 , 24 , and @entity10 , 21 , performed the challenge at their wedding
mrs @entity9 was still in her wedding dress and veil as she was doused
the couple , from @entity11 , hope others will follow their example
