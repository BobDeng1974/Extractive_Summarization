by @entity0 and @entity1 an unemployed couple who live off benefits with their 13 children have had hundreds of fish killed in their garden pond in a suspected grudge attack			1
@entity9 , 44 , and @entity10 , 41 , first attracted attention last year when their council house was combined with the one next door to create a seven - bedroom home			1
last month they appeared in a television documentary where mr @entity9 threatened to have another child just to spite critics who accused them of sponging off the state			1
they have since complained of being subjected to verbal abuse and death threats because of their taxpayer - funded lifestyle			2
the attack happened during the night of july 1 , just eight days after the family appeared on @entity45 programme benefits @entity47 : life on the @entity49			1
mr @entity9 said : ‘ the children went to play around the back garden and they saw all the fish were dead			1
someone had chucked a load of bleach in my pond			2
‘ i just started crying because i love my fish			2
it ’s disgusting to take it out on the poor fish			2
i ’m upset about it and the children are as well			0
’ mr @entity9 has claimed that the fish were paid for when he worked as a security guard – and said he refused to be intimidated , adding : ‘ i ’m going to stand my ground			1
i have got a few more children – so what ? ’ but a neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ it ’s wrong for anyone to kill innocent fish but you have to wonder how someone on benefits can afford to keep 300 koi carp			1
’ angry locals launched a petition to stop mr @entity9 and his family receiving the massive taxpayer - funded home the father of 13 insists that he is still unable to work as he has to care for his 15 - year - old son @entity82 , who is blind in one eye and has learning difficulties , and his partner @entity85 , who suffers from depression			1
the couple currently receive £ 53,000 in child tax credits , disability living allowance , carer ’s allowance , housing benefit and council tax benefit every year			2
they live with @entity95 , 16 , @entity82 , @entity96 , 13 , @entity97 , 11 , @entity98 , ten , @entity99 , five , @entity100 , four , @entity101 , three , @entity102 , two , 14 - month - old @entity103 and @entity104 , seven months			1
their oldest daughters @entity107 , 20 , and @entity108 , 18 , have now moved out			0
during the documentary , mr @entity9 said he was not going to be ‘ dictated to and told how many kids you can have '			1
the family , some of whom are pictured on holiday in @entity116 , @entity117 , say they 've been abused after appearing in @entity118 : life on the @entity49 ' he added : ‘ do you know what ? i think i ’ll have another one			1
’ he also complained that the council had not moved them to alternative accommodation while the £ 36,000 worth of building work was being carried out			2
but dozens of locals have petitioned @entity38 council to complain about the house , which also has two bathrooms , a games room and a wet room			1
police have been informed that the fish were worth £ 1,000 and said they were treating the matter as criminal damage			0
a @entity140 spokesman said : ‘ it is believed that a chemical substance was put in the pond water			0
as a result , 300 koi carp died			0
’ he added : ‘ there were bubbles on top of the water , indicating that a chemical had been added			0
we are investigating and appealing for any witnesses			0
’ according to members of the @entity154 , koi carp can be bought for as little as £ 10 each in bulk , but for rarer varieties , owners can pay up to £ 20,000			0
an avid koi keeper in @entity159 recently paid around £ 180,000 for one fish , thought to be a record			0
to build and fit a fibreglass pond with heaters and filters can require as much as £ 15,000 and the extra cost of water and electricity to keep the pond heated and clean can put around £ 800 to £ 1,000 on top of owners ' bills			0
@entity173 pools cost less to maintain , but can still see water bills rise by about £ 400 a year due to the cost of changing 10 per cent of the water once a fortnight , as is recommended			0
the fish also need to be fed , with 15 koi eating their way through around £ 100 of pellets a year			0
the water should also be treated with medication , which costs around £ 50 to £ 100 a year .			0

@entity9 and his family *sparked* anger by getting six - bedroom council house
they claim they have since been abused in the *street* and threatened
but he has *remained* *defiant* , insisting : ' we are entitled to live anywhere '
he has now found his 300 fish *floating* dead in the huge home 's garden pond
mr @entity9 believes his pets were poisoned as part of *vendetta* against family
comes after the family appeared on @entity205 '
