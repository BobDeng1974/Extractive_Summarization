@entity0 : @entity1 built this body our inspirational fitness columnist @entity5 reports from @entity6 on the fitness and lifestyle trends that have transformed her life - and could do the same for you			1
a workout that delivers maximum results in the minimum amount of time is the @entity15 of fitness in @entity6			1
@entity16 want to stay in great shape , but they also need time for all that working and playing hard – which is why the 5.45pm @entity1 class at my gym is always packed			1
this is how it works : for 20 seconds , do an exercise as fast and hard as you can			1
essentially , that ’s it			1
just four minutes of this patented protocol will burn as many calories as an hour on the treadmill			2
now that ’s what you call efficient			2
but in a class , you then go on to do this routine for a total of 45 minutes			2
@entity38 it comes as little surprise to learn that this futuristic - sounding workout was actually developed in a lab. it is named after dr @entity1 , the @entity44 professor of sports science who invented it			1
back in 1997 , professor @entity1 was working as an @entity48 training coach for the @entity44 speed - skating team when he began analysing the effectiveness of a training regime that involved rotating short bursts of maximum effort with short periods of rest			1
prof @entity1 soon hit on @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , which he believes is the magic formula for increasing both aerobic ( cardiovascular ) and anaerobic ( muscle ) fitness levels			1
it breaks down as 20 seconds on , ten seconds off , repeated eight times , for a total of four minutes			2
@entity66 back in class , this translates into a boot - camp atmosphere and lots of shouting from the teacher – because , in the words of @entity75 himself , ‘ it has to feel extremely difficult for it to be working ’			2
‘ you should be pushing yourself so hard you are not physically able to finish the set ! ! ’ our teacher shrieks above the pounding techno soundtrack			0
the idea is that you go to your absolute edge in any of the given exercises , which are all designed to raise your heartbeat as much and as quickly as possible			0
exhaustion rotation : @entity1 sees you do an exercise as fast and hard as you can for 20 seconds , rest for 20 , and then repeat eight times this might mean a punishing round of ‘ spicy burpees ’ – where you crouch down , place your hands on the ground and jump back into a plank , before performing two push - ups , jumping back to your hands and springing up so your feet come off the floor – or a bout of ‘ sumo jumping jacks ’ , where on each jump in and out you land in a static squat and hold it for one agonising beat			1
it ’s only 20 seconds it all sounds pretty terrifying , i admit			0
but actually , because you know you ’ll get ten blissful seconds of rest for every 20 seconds of effort , it ’s easy to stay motivated			0
which is n’t to say i ’m not always gasping for air – not to mention feeling light - headed and sometimes like i might actually be sick – within minutes of the class getting underway			0
oh , and you sweat buckets			0
@entity0 and new @entity118 actor @entity117 are already fans – and classes will be starting in the @entity121 this year			0
if you want to do it at home , there are masses of @entity127 videos featuring variations on the workout			0
whether or not you ’ll be motivated to push through each and every set without an actual live drill sergeant barking at you is another question , however			0
but do n’t be scared to give it a try – after all , you can do anything for 20 seconds , right ?			0
