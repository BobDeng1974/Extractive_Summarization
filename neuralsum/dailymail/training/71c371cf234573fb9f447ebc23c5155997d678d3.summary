‘ it is about his desires to have that young sexual flesh , to satisfy his own carnal lusts			0
’ ‘ you may feel it had nothing to do with her , it was to do with him , with his desires			2
‘ you may feel he is a man who is flattered by the attention of very young , vulnerable girls			0
’ the prosecutor said it was interesting that his wife , @entity51 , was a ‘ very young - looking , petite woman with her own vulnerabilities			1

’ referring to the eight days they spent on the run in @entity82 , in which they used fake names to apply for jobs , he added : ‘ you may feel it is the oddest school trip in which one teacher goes away with one pupil and school activities include having sex with a 15 - year - old and changing identities			1
’ the schoolgirl ’s mother wept in the public gallery as mr @entity25 said that the worst ‘ betrayal ’ had been of her daughter			2

‘ you do not expect your school to invite people to have sex with your under - age daughter and you do not expect it to be the teacher			0
’ mr @entity25 reminded the jury that @entity2 had decided not to give evidence and had not filed a statement of his defence			1
he continued : ‘ mr @entity2 , what is your defence ? ‘ you may feel this is the question he fears the most because , during his experience as a teacher , he may have heard some pretty lame excuses for homework not being done on time			1
upset : @entity51 , the wife of @entity2 , his as she left @entity15 in @entity148 yesterday claims : @entity2 , pictured today , heard how friends had called him an outstanding teacher who had improved students ' grades ‘ and he may think ' please , sir , i do n't have a defence - my dog ate it ' is n't going to cut the mustard , is n't going to stand up to scrutiny and that he had no defence at all			1
‘ you may feel he is a maths teacher whose story does n't add up			0
i invite you to find him guilty as charged			0

his sister , @entity174 , a mother - of - three from @entity175 , described her brother as a doting uncle and godfather			0
she said : ' he 's very good - natured and extremely mild - mannered , ' adding that depression may have contributed to his recent actions			0
she said : ' @entity110 had been in a very difficult relationship for the last six years but did n't want to worry anybody , especially our parents , with his problems			0
' instead he withdrew more and more and i believe he became more and more depressed			0
' @entity187 , defending , told the jury that @entity2 had gone with the girl to @entity11 because he feared she was suicidal			1
he said that this was a ' realistic situation ' and the defendant had acted to ensure her well - being			0

the schoolgirl 's mother told @entity15 she ' went mad ' at her daughter when she confronted her about @entity2 he said : ' in that play the lovers died in the end , a pair of star - crossed lovers is the way @entity205 put it			1

' he added : ' she was very desperate , she had suicidal thoughts and she was assertive			0
if he had not taken her , the alternative consequences were likely to be much worse			1
' if he had taken her back to her mother or the police , no - one would be able to stop her , it may indeed have been the catalyst for worse consequences			0
' judge @entity225 adjourned the case until tomorrow when he will sum up the case before sending the jury out to consider its verdict			0

@entity2 relying on character witnesses rather than *speaking* himself
he appeared to have a black eye as he sat in court
the prosecutor said it was not a case of ' @entity64 ' as they were not ‘ equal ’ partners in what happened
@entity2 's defence said the girl was suicidal and if he had not taken her , the alternative consequences were likely to be much worse
*mrs* @entity51 warned @entity2 to end contact with pupil before they fled
