now in custody , the young boy stands accused of intentionally setting a @entity10 , @entity9 fire april 29 that left no one injured but killed several pets and destroyed two occupied apartment buildings , leaving dozens to try and make sense of it all			1
one of those confused and displaced tenants is @entity18			2
though only just informed of the suspect ’s age , @entity18 was n’t shy about venting her frustrations			2
‘ that too will be put on hold			2
this little child has taken so much from all of us and i hope he gets the maximum punishment possible ! ’ and she had even more reason to be angry			2
@entity18 also lost her livelihood			2
‘ this destroyed me , not because the flat - screen tv i [ lost ] , or the computer , or even the clothes and shoes i loved , but drawings and cards my husband had done for me			1
not the fact i even lost all my hair tools i had			2
i graduated from cosmetology school and recently received my temporary cosmetology license , allowing me to work in a salon ... that will be on hold now , for i have nothing ! ’ blame game : firefighters put out the flames despite fears they might not contain the massive blaze			0
now those who lost everything wonder who to blame when the suspect is a child @entity65 : @entity10 , @entity9 police chief @entity66 stressed the need to protect the accused due to his age some were n’t as quick to place the blame			1
‘ i am just sad , ’ said @entity72 , another among the displaced			0
‘ i feel bad for the choices that he chose to make			0
i think he is old enough to know right from wrong			0
and i 'm sorry but i also have to wonder about the guidance and discipline he has been brought up with			0
children should know that there are consequences for one 's actions			0
’ and though it causes shock in some , the boy ’s age is also a reason to protect him			1
officials will not release his name			0
angry : some affected by the fire felt no remorse from pointing fingers			1
' this little child has taken so much from all of us , ' said one displaced woman which is likely for the best , since previous rumors had swirled that the blaze began after a methamphetamine lab exploded , or due to some other drug activity			0
‘ i am shocked it would be a 12 - year - old boy , ’ said @entity101 , who has friends who lived in the affected buildings			1
‘ i was informed it was a drug deal gone bad			0
’ the boy set a fire on a porch behind a condemned apartment building monday evening , where it spread to that building and two others , authorities said			1
victims : 75 were left displaced from the fire and several house pets were killed two of the buildings have already been razed , and the third is due to be torn down next week			1
police declined to comment on the boy 's motives or say whether he lived in the condemned building , also to protect his identity			1
people were still living in six units even though the building had been condemned a month earlier			0
the flames were first seen engulfing a back porch			0
the blaze grew so large that firefighters worried about having enough water pressure , and the plume of smoke could be seen on weather radar 35 miles away in @entity137			0
totaled : officials say the boy started the fire on a back porch of a condemned building and it spread			1
all three buildings will be leveled			1
