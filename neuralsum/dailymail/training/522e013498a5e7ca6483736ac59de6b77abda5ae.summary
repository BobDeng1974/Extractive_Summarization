@entity1 pensioners are being sent to care homes in @entity3 and @entity4 in what has been described as an ‘ inhumane deportation ’			1
rising numbers of the elderly and sick are moved overseas for long - term care because of sky - high costs at home			1
some private healthcare providers are even building homes overseas , while state insurers are also investigating whether they can care for their clients abroad			1
experts describe a time bomb ’ of increasing numbers unable to afford the growing costs of retirement homes			1
inhumane : rising numbers of @entity1 's elderly and sick are being sent to care homes in @entity3 and @entity4 because of rising care home costs and they say the situation should be a warning to @entity30 , where rising numbers of pensioners are forced to sell their homes to pay for care			1
the @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , a socio - political advisory group , said the fact that many @entity1 were unable to afford the costs of a retirement home in their own country was a huge ‘ alarm signal ’			1
‘ we simply can not let those people , who built @entity1 up to be what it is , be deported , ’ @entity36 ’s president @entity42 told @entity43			0
’ researchers found an estimated 7,146 @entity1 pensioners living in retirement homes in @entity51 in 2011			2
more than 3,000 were in the @entity52 and more than 600 in @entity53			0
there were also unknown numbers in @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity58 , as well as @entity59 and the @entity60			0
some told researchers they were there out of choice as costs were lower , while standards of care were often higher			2
but many others admitted they moved reluctantly			0
criticism : experts have described the ' time bomb ' of increasing numbers unable to afford the growing costs of retirement homes , while others have spoken of ' inhumane deportation ' ( stock image ) according to @entity1 ’s federal bureau of statistics , more than 400,000 senior citizens can not afford a @entity1 retirement home , a figure growing by around 5 per cent a year			1
this is because many are living for longer while their pensions are stagnating			0
as a result , the @entity87 – or statutory insurers that make up @entity1 ’s state insurance system – are discussing cheaper care in foreign retirement homes			2
@entity93 law prevents state insurers from signing contracts with overseas homes			0
but that is likely to change as legislators are forced to respond to @entity3 ’s ageing population			0
@entity100 , the owner of @entity101 – which finds care homes for @entity1 in @entity53 – said it was wrong to suggest senior citizens were being ‘ deported ’			2
‘ many are here of their own free will , the results of sensible decisions by their families who know they will be better off , ’ he said .			0
