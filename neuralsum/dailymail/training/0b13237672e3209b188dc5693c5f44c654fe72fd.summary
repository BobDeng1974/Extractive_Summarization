@entity0 was facing a backbench revolt last night over @entity3 ’s failure to support a judge - led inquiry into @entity7 complicity in torture			1
the party ’s high command still insists a @entity12 committee should investigate even though it presided over an alleged whitewash in the extraordinary rendition affair			1
a string of mr @entity0 ’s mps yesterday declared that disturbing questions raised by a @entity20 @entity19 report on the barbaric treatment of detainees by the @entity23 should be answered once and for all			1
@entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 all said only a judge - led process would do			0
his brother @entity40 could even be called to give evidence to any inquiry			1
as foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010 , he is accused of trying to cover up @entity7 ’s involvement in @entity23 wrongdoing			1
other @entity3 figures facing questions include @entity48 and @entity49 , who broke cover yesterday to say he had never condoned torture			1
on another day of drama at @entity12 : a string of mr @entity0 ’s mps declared only a probe by a judge could clear up the disturbing questions raised by a @entity20 @entity19 report on the barbaric treatment of detainees by the @entity23			1
both @entity25 ( left ) and @entity26 ( right ) said past mistakes should not be covered up @entity61 said on sunday that she doubted @entity63 ’s intelligence and security committee had the capacity and the scope to carry out an inquiry and her ‘ instinct ’ was for a judge - led process			2
however , the shadow home secretary then stopped short of backing the full judicial investigation sought by mps on all sides			1
last night a source close to mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity0 agrees with the position set out by @entity61			0
the government has outlined that the intelligence committee will be doing it , we have some concerns on it but we need to see the way the government sets that out			0
as foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010 , @entity83 is accused of trying to cover up @entity7 ’s involvement in @entity23 wrongdoing ‘ we are not at this stage calling for anything to go further than that			1
’ yesterday mrs may said that , since her appointment in 2010 , she had seen no evidence of the security services being complicit in ill treatment			0
but , turning the spotlight on the @entity3 years , she added : ‘ i can not speak for what might have happened in the past before this government came into office			2
’ mr @entity99 also spoke out , saying senior figures in the last @entity3 government should give evidence on what they knew			1
the deputy prime minister added : ‘ if people are found to have broken the law , the full weight of the law should come down on them without fear or favour , however operationally grand they are			0
’ when mrs may appeared before the home affairs committee , @entity111 took the opportunity to call for a judge - led investigation			0
mr @entity25 said it was time for @entity7 – which is still to publish the @entity119 report into the @entity120 – to ‘ get away from this policy of trying to cover up past mistakes ’			2
he added : ‘ the ( @entity19 torture ) report degrades our reputation as allies of the @entity20			2
’ other @entity3 mps demanding a judicial inquiry included mr @entity26 and @entity130			1
mr @entity26 said an investigation by a judge was needed to ‘ clear this whole matter up once and for all ’			0
@entity134 , the committee ’s chairman , stopped short of calling for a judge - led inquiry , but said it looks like being the next stage			2
the @entity3 mp added : ‘ the status quo is not going to be enough			0
’ mrs may came under pressure to explain the extent to which @entity7 had lobbied to have the @entity135 report – which detailed @entity23 beatings , waterboarding and the rectal feeding of detainees – redacted			2
it had been stripped of any mention of @entity151 , @entity152 or @entity153 – the @entity7 base which @entity83 belatedly admitted had been used for at least two rendition flights			0
as the @entity157 revealed last week , there were 22 meetings between the @entity19 committee and @entity7 ambassadors			2
mrs may also personally met its chairman @entity162 , though not on the date originally given by the @entity165			0
the home secretary said she had not personally asked for any of the report to be redacted , and the pair had discussed ‘ other things ’			2
a number of celebrities and politicians have signed a letter to @entity174 demanding @entity176 ’s release from @entity177			1
the father of four is pictured here with two of his children other @entity3 figures facing questions are @entity48 ( left ) and @entity49 ( right ) , who broke cover yesterday to say he had never condoned torture but she conceded : ‘ the @entity7 had an opportunity to ensure there was no evidence put in which would damage our national security			1
’ despite the growing clamour on all sides for a judicial inquiry , mrs may said she also believed the intelligence and security committee should be allowed to complete the task			0
@entity111 have voiced concerns that the committee – which cleared @entity151 and @entity152 of involvement in extraordinary rendition in 2007 – does not have sufficient powers			0
@entity203 chairman sir @entity202 has said he will ask the @entity19 to reveal which parts of its damning report the @entity206 asked to be redacted from the published version			0
however , other members of the @entity7 committee have questioned why he does not simply request the information from @entity7 authorities rather than go down the time - consuming road of negotiating with the @entity20			0
mr @entity49 ’s office issued a statement saying : ‘ @entity49 has always been opposed to the use of torture , has always said so publicly and privately , has never condoned its use and – as is shown by internal government documentation already made public – thinks it is totally unacceptable			1
’ the statement did not address any of the specific allegations that – during the war on terror – @entity7 agents were complicit in extraordinary rendition or had turned a blind eye to abuse of detainees			0
@entity83 and mr @entity48 were unavailable for comment last night			0
last week @entity0 leapt to the defence of his brother , saying he would ‘ never ’ have knowingly allowed @entity7 agents to become involved in rendition and torture programmes run by the @entity23 .			1
