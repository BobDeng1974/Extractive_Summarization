president @entity0 is under fire this week for the way his @entity3 has excoriated the previous administration for employing tactics it would categorize as torture all the while launching drone strikes on terrorism suspects abroad			1
the enhanced interrogation techniques used by the @entity11 during the @entity13 administration on 39 detainees resulted in just one death , @entity0 's critics have pointed out			1
drone strikes conducted by the current occupant of the @entity3 have killed more than 2,400 people			1
after claiming all week that the release of a @entity21 report detailing the brutal tactics employed by the @entity13 administration to elicit information from terrorists was necessary in order for the @entity27 to reassert it 's ' moral authority , ' the @entity3 was forced on friday to state on record that it does n't believe its drone policy erodes the moral high ground on which it thinks it stands when it comes to human rights			1
appearing on @entity51 's @entity50 that evening , @entity45 and the conservative television host chastised the @entity0 administration for its own questionable anti-terrorism tactics			1
@entity51 wondered how the @entity0 administration 's drone program is ' not far more morally problematic than enhanced interrogation ' to the @entity57 chairwoman of the @entity58 's @entity21			1
' this administration does not take any prisoners , they prefer to kill them from afar , using drones , ' @entity45 chimed in			1
' and somehow , they feel that because they kill from a distance , somehow , it ’s more ethical … more ethical than the difficult and messy and unpleasant task and mission of actually interrogating prisoners , ' he continued , adding , ' i think it ’s a distortion of what our values are			0
' @entity51 went on to say that if he had to choose between being waterboarded , one of the approved interrogation tactics of the @entity13 administration 's @entity11 , or being droned , he 'd prefer to be waterboarded			1
' i think i ’ll take the waterboarding , too , ' @entity45 replied			0
while waterboarding has been the most commonly cited enhanced interrogation technique since @entity0 banned the use of the harsh tactics during his first days in office , its one of 13 on the list that the @entity11 used at the time			1
others include sleep deprivation , cramped confinement , nudity and stress positions			0
unapproved tactics that the the @entity13 administration says the @entity11 used without authorization were rectal feeding and a process referred to in the report as ' rectal rehydration			2
' a young @entity99 refugee stuck on @entity100 cries in this november photo after a gauntlet of older and stronger refugees pushed their way onto an @entity109 @entity108 @entity107 helicopter sent to evacuate them			0
the @entity3 pushed back on criticism this week that its drone strikes against terrorists kill thousands of innocents by pointing out that @entity116 ' terror tactics kill substantially more taking the argument against the @entity0 administration drone policies a step further on wednesday morning former @entity118 congressman and current @entity120 host @entity117 said present @entity27 policy appears to be : ' let ’s just go ahead and just kill them all , and if we kill 5 - year - old girls and 85 - year - old grandmas , so be it ; we feel better about ourselves because that seems cleaner			1
' that ’s what liberals are saying today , ' he charged			0
' that ’s what [ vice president ] @entity138 ’s been saying , that ’s what @entity0 ’s been saying			0
' continuing , he claimed ' the drone program went into overdrive on january 21st , 2009 ' when @entity0 took office			2
' when you talk about five years from now , ten years from now , the information comes out about this drone program , and people actually report on this drone program , it ’s going to look a hell of a lot worse , a hell of a lot deadlier , a hell of a lot more random , and a hell of a lot more inhumane than waterboarding three prisoners in 2002 and 2003 , ' he said			2
on friday @entity0 's spokesman @entity155 was confronted about the possibility that this @entity3 's drone policies would be disparaged by a future administration with as much hostility as the current one is showing the @entity13 era program			1
@entity155 told the inquiring reporter , @entity164 radio 's @entity162 , he ' would not envision a scenario where that would occur			0
' ' @entity168 operations , lethal counterterrorrism operations , are only conducted as a last resort , ' he said , ' and the president has emphasized that extraordinary care needs to be taken ' to ensure that such counterterrorism measures are ' carried out in accordance with all applicable domestic and international laws , and are consistent with @entity27 values and policy			0
' @entity3 press secretary @entity155 said on friday he does n't think the @entity0 administration 's drone policy undermines its self - proclaimed ' moral authority ' after stating that ' 40x more ' people ' are affected by drones than held in @entity183 , ' @entity162 then asked @entity155 if ' the animating principle here ' is ' if the president does it , it is not illegal ? ' a visibly irritated @entity155 told him , ' no , i think the animating principle here is that the president is committed , in fact , to upholding both @entity27 and international law and ensuring that all of the actions that are taken are consistent with our values and our policy			1
' those values are what uphold our moral authority around the globe , and that 's why the president is determined to ensure that our counterterrorism operations are consistent with those values , ' @entity155 said , restating already established administration policy that the @entity27 ' ' moral authority ' is one of the ' most powerful tools ' in its ' arsenal to protecting @entity27 interests around the globe			1
' @entity162 pressed the @entity0 administration further and asked him any aspect of the @entity3 's drone policy undermines its self proclaimed moral authority , at which point @entity155 again stressed that ' great precautions are taken ' to make sure that innocents are not killed in @entity27 drone strikes			1
backing him into a corner , the @entity3 correspondent repeated his question			0
' no , ' @entity155 curtly said before moving on to another reporter 's questions			0
earlier this week @entity155 faced a similar cross-examination of administration policy from @entity50 ' senior @entity3 correspondent , @entity230			2
' you have repeatedly talked about moral authority , ' @entity230 said			2
' so can you explain how the president believes that it ’s un-american to use these [ enhanced interrogation ] techniques , but it ’s ok to ramp up the drone policy and basically thousands of people across the world , innocent civilians were killed ? ' what ’s the moral equivalency there ? how do you have moral authority when innocent civilians are killed by drones ? ' @entity230 asked			1
@entity155 told him there 's a ' stark difference in the way the @entity27 conducts our policy , and the way that terrorists around the world conduct their policy , ' stating the strict precautions taken			2
' i understand there are safeguards , ' @entity230 said			0
' but in the end , we ’ve seen many cases around the world where @entity27 drones have killed innocent civilians despite those safeguards			1
so how do you have moral authority ? ' he again asked			1
' what i ’m saying is that is a stark difference from the tactics that are employed by our enemies , who seek to use car bombs to actually target innocent civilians , ' @entity155 said , adding that the @entity27 goes ' to great lengths to protect the lives of innocent civilians			2
' ' in fact , many of the terrorists that we ’re talking about , and again , many of these counterterrorism activities that are used against terrorists are targeting terrorists that themselves have targeted local populations , that have targeted fellow @entity285 in some situations			0
' so the efforts that are taken by this administration to limit or to prevent innocent civilian casualties are consistent with our values , and are consistent with our broader strategy for protecting the @entity27 people , ' he contended			0
asked on wednesday whether the @entity27 still has any moral high ground left in light of the @entity58 's damning report on the @entity13 era programs , released the day before , a top @entity27 general that oversees the operations at terrorist - holding prison @entity183 made a similar argument			2
“ i would say that people who said to me , " well , we have now lost the moral high ground , " i think that ’s foolishness , ' @entity302 gen. @entity301 , the chief of @entity303 told attendees of a human rights summit , per a report in the @entity307			0
' some might say that			0
the jihadists were saying it today , ' he noted			0
' gim me a break			0
[ @entity315 ] is telling us we lost the moral high ground ? i love it			0
