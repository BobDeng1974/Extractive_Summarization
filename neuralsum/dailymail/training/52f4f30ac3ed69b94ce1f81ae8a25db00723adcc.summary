drones could prove invaluable in search and rescue operations as well as disaster scenarios where it is dangerous for relief workers to enter buildings			1
but currently quadcopters risk injuring humans with their blades and break easily upon light collisions because of their delicate , exposed parts			2
now engineers have created the ‘ world ’s first collision - proof drone ’ that has a spherical case , meaning it can bounce around buildings like a ball			1
scientists from @entity37 ’s @entity36 first unveiled their drone in a roll cage made of pentagons last year , but have now won $ 1 million in a drone competition sponsored by the @entity42			1
‘ @entity44 can safely fly indoors and in complex environments , is easy to fly , and can be operated close to humans , ’ they say on their website			2
‘ it solves multiple challenges in inspection of industrial facilities , rail and roadways , firefighting , search and rescue , marketing and communication as well as law enforcement			1
’ the drone , named @entity44 , can fly safely indoors ( shown left ) and crawl through confined spaces ( right ) to inspect industrial buildings			2
it 's hopes it could be used to detect survivors in buildings hit by disaster a pilot from @entity69 has teamed up with drone makers to create a global database that lets anyone set up no - fly zones above their homes and offices			1
to add a zone , users must enter their location , name and an email address to verify the request			0
this address is converted into a latitude and longitude point , as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property			0
for the first property the site does n’t ask for proof of residence , but for subsequent addresses users need to show a form of identification or utility bill			0
the address is then sent to drone makers and added to a no - fly database used each time a drone takes off			2
many drones have technology that automatically prevents them flying over registered regions			0
at launch , founder @entity105 has partnered with manufacturers @entity107 , @entity109 , @entity110 + , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
by partnering with mr @entity105 , these makers promise to adhere to the registered zones but are not under a legal obligation to do so			0
this means that the machines could provide a cheap , fast and safe alternative to sending humans into crumbling buildings after earthquakes or in warzones , for example			0
the drone ’s rotors are suspended inside a free moving spherical carbon fibre cage so they do n’t injure humans , or break when hitting obstacles			1
its rotating camera stand - called a gimbal system - and hd camera are also housed in the protective cage			2
images sent from the camera to a remote control unit , allow operators to see what the drone is ‘ seeing ’ , the @entity136 reported			1
because all the delicate machinery is inside the cage , the drone can bounce between roof rafters and roll along uneven floors without damaging itself - or any nearby humans - and remain stable after a collision			1
its structure also enables it to send back close - up images to operators , which could show up details of defects in industrial buildings , for example , @entity151 reported			0
the engineers behind the drone also claim that it ’s simpler to operate than a conventional quadcopter because the drone can bounce off walls and floors , preventing expensive crashes			1
the researchers ’ company , @entity166 , plans to use the prize money to continue developing the drone , including adding infrared night vision and creating software so that it can be easily used by search and rescue professionals			1
it aims to enable the drone to be used to find victims , as well as detecting chemical leaks and assess damaged infrastructure and buildings			0
dr @entity179 , cto and co-founder of the company , said : ‘ the funds will be used to finalise the development and manufacturing of our beta prototypes , to allow the delivery to our first customers as early as april 2015 ’			0
@entity188 , drones risk injuring humans with their blades and break easily upon light collisions because of their delicate , exposed parts			0
a stock image of'conventional ' drone is shown the drone ’s rotors and camera are suspended inside a spherical carbon fibre cage so they do n’t injure humans , or break when hitting obstacles			1
a view seen by an operator is shown			0

@entity37 engineers have created the ‘ world ’s first collision - proof drone ’
its rotor blades and camera are suspended in a spherical cage
construction means it can bounce off walls without damaging its parts
it 's hoped the drone could one *day* be used in search and rescue *missions*
