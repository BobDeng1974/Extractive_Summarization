@entity0 are ready to spend another £ 150million next summer to complete the @entity1 at @entity2			1
@entity0 are convinced they are heading in the right direction under @entity4 and want to copy the @entity6 blueprint by having an elite player in every position			2
after backing the @entity9 by making six signings last summer — including smashing the @entity12 transfer record to sign @entity13 for £ 59.7m — the club are preparing for another massive investment , with senior sources insisting that the rebuilding has only just begun			0
@entity0 boss @entity4 , waving to the crowd , looks set to continue an overhaul of his squad @entity21 and @entity23 star @entity22 is a potential target of @entity25 's at @entity2 @entity0 have spent £ 215m on players since september 2013 in a bid to reverse the alarming decline of the past 18 months , and another spree on the scale of last summer would take their investment beyond £ 350m			1
@entity25 has made centre back , right back and winger his main target areas			0
@entity0 have not ruled out making signings in the january transfer window — as was the case with @entity39 ’s £ 37.1m arrival from @entity40 at the start of this year — but suspect they will have to wait until the summer to find the right players			1
the list includes @entity44 right back @entity45 , @entity21 winger @entity22 , central defenders @entity46 of @entity48 and @entity49 of @entity50 , and @entity52 defensive midfielder @entity51			1
@entity52 's @entity51 ( left ) and @entity44 's @entity45 could be set for moves to @entity0 @entity51 ( @entity52 ) - likely fee : £ 30m the @entity52 midfielder , 24 , might have been a @entity0 player already had he not suffered a knee injury in march and the club have retained a strong interest			1
@entity49 ( @entity50 ) - likely fee : £ 28.5m the experienced @entity50 centre back , 28 , is on @entity0 ’s list of targets but they would have to trigger the £ 28.5m release clause in his contract			1
@entity45 ( @entity44 ) - likely fee : free @entity0 want elite players and signing the 31 - year - old @entity68 right back , out of contract at @entity44 next summer , would be a coup			1
@entity46 ( @entity48 ) - likely fee : £ 32m @entity0 ’s inquiry for the @entity75 centre - back , 25 , was rebuffed last summer but the @entity2 paymasters are ready to try again			1
@entity22 ( @entity21 ) - likely fee : £ 20m @entity25 has made little secret of his desire to be reunited with the @entity21 winger , 30 , a key member of his @entity23 squad at the @entity82			2
as @entity48 struggle at the bottom of @entity85 , @entity46 could seek a transfer @entity50 centre back @entity49 has been highlighted as a transfer target at @entity88 @entity0 also have a big decision to make over striker @entity90 , who will cost a further £ 46m on top of his £ 6m loan fee if his move from @entity94 is made permanent			1
the @entity96 striker has struggled with injury so far , scoring just once			0
a fresh influx of signings will be followed by another major clear - out after 20 players were cut from the first - team squad last summer			2
reserve goalkeeper @entity103 could be the first to go in january , paving the way for @entity0 to offer a contract to former @entity44 no 1 @entity106 who has been training at @entity108 as he recuperates from a serious knee - ligament injury			0
@entity0 have decided to keep @entity110 until the end of his contract in the summer rather than give him a £ 1.4m pay - off next month , but a number of @entity115 clubs are interested in taking the midfielder back to his homeland and @entity2 sources are optimistic a buyer can be found			1
striker @entity90 needs to prove his fitness in order to force a permanent move to @entity0 @entity124 @entity123 celebrates scoring for @entity6 , where he is on loan this season @entity126 , who has one year left on his contract , has only scored four goals for @entity0 this season @entity128 has been in impressive form on loan at @entity130 but @entity0 are unlikely to recall the @entity132 winger and will look to sell to any club prepared to take on his wages of £ 120,000 a week			0
@entity123 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 are also out on loan and unlikely to return			0
@entity139 is out of contract at the end of the season , while @entity126 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 will have one year left on their deals			0
it means that up to 10 players could leave @entity2 in addition to last summer ’s exodus			2
that represents a massive turnover for a club that grew accustomed to stability under sir @entity157			0
@entity145 ( top ) could be one of 10 @entity0 players to leave the club in january or the summer @entity39 , who has recently regained his top form , was a january window signing from @entity40 this year however , @entity0 are satisfied with the way @entity25 has overhauled the squad and remain confident they can return to the @entity166 elite with the right investment and approach			1
despite a poor start , the new manager has taken his team into fourth place in the @entity174 table after signing @entity175 , @entity90 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 in the summer			0
two players @entity0 do want to keep are goalkeeper @entity181 and @entity182			2
@entity183 has matured into one of the best goalkeepers in @entity185 since joining @entity0 in the summer of 2011 but the @entity186 will be out of contract in 18 months time			0
goalkeeper @entity181 has been in inspirational form @entity0 so far this season that has alerted @entity6 but a @entity0 source insisted they are ‘ completely relaxed ’ over @entity183 ’s situation , even though negotiations with his representatives have yet to begin in earnest			0
the club also have an option to extend @entity182 ’s contract by a further 12 months and seem likely to do so following the veteran midfielder ’s return from ankle surgery			0
meanwhile , @entity0 have yet to decide whether to arrange a prestige friendly abroad or a warm - weather training trip to the @entity203 in january and will leave the final decision to @entity25 .			2

@entity4 set to add key players to his @entity0 side
@entity22 , @entity45 and @entity51 on the *wishlist*
@entity49 and @entity46 are also linked with a move to @entity2
@entity0 have spent £ 215m on players since september 2013
