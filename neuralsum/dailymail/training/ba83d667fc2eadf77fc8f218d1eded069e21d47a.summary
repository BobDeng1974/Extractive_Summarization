by @entity0 monster : care worker @entity2 who has admitted raping three women in a @entity4 care home			1
he was arrested for a sexual offence in 2007 but continued to work in care after the case was dropped a care worker who raped three vulnerable women could have been brought to justice nearly a decade ago if a sex abuse prosecution had not been dropped			1
@entity2 , 48 , attacked the victims - who all lived in supported accommodation in @entity4 - when he was supposedly looking after them			1
the victims , aged 32 , 50 and 54 , all have learning disabilities , difficulties communicating and require 24 - hour care			1
he was today jailed for 14 years			1
now it has been revealed that in april 2007 @entity21 arrested him on suspicion of inciting sexual activity with a mentally ill woman			1
the alleged victim had severe communication difficulties and there was also no witnesses to support her account - meaning it was her word against @entity2 , who lives in @entity29 , @entity4			1
he was released on bail and police presented a file of evidence to the @entity35 but four months later lawyers decided there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction			2
the case against @entity2 was dropped and he continued to work in the care industry			1
but @entity21 admitted it did not tell social services of the allegations made against @entity44 - leaving him free to rape his victims			1
detective chief superintendent @entity47 , head of specialist crime operations at @entity21 , said the force had carried out a comprehensive inquiry into @entity2 in 2007			1
' there was a very full and thorough investigation and we liaised with the @entity35 and gave them a file of evidence , ' he said			0
' they have to make an assessment and they decided there was insufficient evidence on this particular occasion to support a prosecution			0
' photos of forensic examinations carried out in the bedroom of one of the victims of @entity2 @entity2 was employed to work the night shift and help with day - to - day tasks			1
due to staff cut backs he worked alone , @entity71 heard			0
in april last year a second investigation into @entity2 began when one of his colleagues reported that a resident had told them they had been abused by him , the court was told			1
@entity44 , who had worked in the care industry for 13 years and in his current job since 2007 , was immediately arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault and suspended			1
detectives used a specialist intermediary with @entity86 cards ( a visual language system used to communicate with people who have learning difficulties ) to question residents who @entity2 had been in contact with , after the first victim suggested there were others who had been abused			1
those inquiries found the second victim and forensic inquiries linked @entity2 to a third vulnerable adult			1
in august he was charged with three counts of rape and three of sexual assault			2
judge @entity103 told @entity2 ' these three ladies had the bodies of adults but the minds of children and little children at that			1
' they were every bit as vulnerable as little children and in some ways they were more vulnerable			1
estimony : an example of a @entity86 card used to communicate with the victims of @entity2 , so that they were able to give an account of what he had done to them ' whereas a child might later have been able to explain what had happened to them when they had reached maturity these three ladies will never be able to explain fully either what happened or how they feel			1
' i have no doubt you chose them as your victims because of their respective vulnerabilities			2
' you had sex with each of them			2
such behaviour was cruel and depraved			0
none of those ladies was capable of giving consent as you well knew			0
' although they find it difficult to explain what happened there is no doubt that your behaviour has left them very disturbed and deeply upset			0
' mr @entity47 said there had been many changes to the way crimes against vulnerable adults were now investigated by the police both in @entity4 and nationally			1
' we now have a specialist team of officers investigating offences such as this , ' he said			0
' but we also have much closer working with @entity158 , so we have a much more effective exchange of information			0
' so any incident involving any potential abuse in a care home setting , we will be exchanging information about that , so we are much better placed to be able to prevent any further incidents from occurring			2
' i think we are much better placed now and it is much less likely that offending such as that will be able to continue because we do have the effective warnings and information exchange between the police and @entity158			2
' @entity173 , head of the @entity175 rape and serious sexual offence unit , explained why @entity2 had not been prosecuted in 2007			1
' all offences of a sexual nature are considered serious and every effort is made to prosecute such cases subject to the @entity181 being met , ' she said			0
' in 2007 a complainant made an allegation of a sexual assault by @entity2			1
@entity2 was interviewed and denied the offence			1
this was one person 's word against another			0
' in the absence of any corroboration the decision was made that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction			0
' @entity2 had been subjected to an enhanced @entity198 check by his employer , which means police would have been able to disclose information about the 2007 invetigation because it was relevant to his employment			1
' police informed his employer of the allegations and it was his employer ’s responsibility to inform social services , ' a force spokesman told the @entity210			1
@entity211 said it did know about the allegations against @entity2 and has now commissioned a serious case review			2
' the county council was aware of a police investigation in 2007 , but no charges were brought and the case was closed , ' a spokeswoman said			2
' however , we have now asked the @entity220 to carry out a serious case review to understand exactly what happened in the past and to check we are doing all we can to keep our vulnerable people safe			2
' @entity2 pleaded guilty to three counts of rape , which were all committed between january 1 2012 and april 1 2013			1
he denied two offences of sexual assault and they were ordered to lie on file by the judge			2
distressed parents and relatives of @entity2 ’ victims were in court , several in tears , as prosecutor @entity236 detailed @entity2 ’ offences			1
she read statements from the mothers and sisters of the victims describing how their lives had been devastated by what @entity2 did			1
one mother said that her daughter had not been expected to live more than a few days after birth but had survived - only to become a victim of @entity2			2
' i vowed as long as i lived that no - one would hurt her , ' she stated			0
' how wrong was i ? ' she said her daughter went into the home in 2009 after her father had a heart attack			0
on april 15 last year when she was told what @entity2 had done to her daughter ‘ our world fell apart , ’ she stated ,			2
' i felt numb and shocked and physically sick			0
my husband had to go outside to get some air			0
i wanted to hold her tight but i was in such a state that she would have been upset to see me like that			0
' we thought she would be safe and would never come to any harm			0
' ' predator ' : one of the detectives who brought @entity2 said he has not shown a shred of remorse for his sickening actions one of the detectives who brought @entity2 to justice branded him a ' sexual predator ' who has not shown a shred of remorse for his sickening actions			2
detective sergeant @entity275 was the second - in - command during the inquiry and interviewed the perverted care worker			2
' he is somebody who gave me a great deal of concern , ' the officer said			0
' clearly he is a sexual predator and one of the things that struck me was that at no point did i see anything that suggested any kind of remorse for what he had done			0
' i still do n't think that he can understand the ramification of his actions			0
' these victims already face some pretty difficult challenges in their lives and then they find themselves being abused in this callous and cruel way by a man supposedly looking after them			0
' it is not just the victims who he has hurt but the families who have to live with this for the rest of their lives			0
' he did deny these offences and it was quite frustrating for the investigating officers that as the evidence mounted against him , and that evidence was put to him , he maintained his position			0
' i ca n't account for why he did that but perhaps he thought it was something he might get away with			0
' i think he might have thought that because his victims were very vulnerable getting accounts from them can be quite challenging			2
' but we managed to do that with the use of intermediaries to interview the victims and when he came to court in january he was left with no option but to plead guilty			0
' det sgt @entity275 added : ' i wish he had done it earlier so that the victims would not have this hanging over them for so long			0
' i think it was a combination of the amount of evidence that was against him			0
' i 'd like to say it was compassion for the victims but i still see no reaction from @entity2			1
' the detective , who has worked in public protection for two years , said the three victims were relieved when told @entity2 would be going to prison for a long time			1
' i am told at various stages some of the women have been quite disturbed by it , ' he said			0
' when he pleaded guilty in january officers from @entity340 went to speak to the victims and told them that ' @entity2 ' would never be coming back and could not hurt them again			1
' i am told there were lots of smiles and lots of relief			0
' but their families have been left devastated at what @entity2 has done to their loved ones			2
' when you have vested your trust in somebody to look after your daughter , your auntie , your mum and they are exploited like this , i think it is very difficult to comprehend how they must have felt , ' he said			0
' the families have been very supportive of our investigation and have been very patient , very brave and very resolute			0

@entity2 was today jailed for 14 years for sexually abusing the women
a judge described the victims as ' every bit as vulnerable as little children '
it has now *emerged* that he has arrested on a sex charge in 2007
police did not tell social services about the arrest , which was later dropped
he continued to work in care and went on to rape the women
