@entity1 developed a cough and wheezing a few weeks after his birth
his mother took him to a gp who gave him nasal drops and paracetamol
his breathing worsened a few days later so she took him to out - of - hours @entity168
was told he probably had a viral infection and that was normal for his age
was taken to another gp a few days later but died later that *afternoon*
coroner says he died from fluid in the lungs caused by a viral infection
all three doctors claim they were not told he was wheezing - but @entity1 ' mother strongly refutes this claim
