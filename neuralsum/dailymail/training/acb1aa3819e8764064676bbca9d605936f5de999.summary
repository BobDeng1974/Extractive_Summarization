they have a better squad , a better record and – in keeping with the @entity4 reputation for meticulous preparation – they appear to have bagged the best accommodation , too			1
while @entity7 have plumped for an ageing @entity9 hotel close to a gang - infested slum as their base , the @entity4 will luxuriate in a secluded , specially - built £ 25million resort within easy reach of all their games			1
funded jointly by the @entity4 fa and private enterprise , the @entity18 resort offers beach - facing villas , hot tubs , a 2,000 sq ft pool area and its own restaurant			1
the @entity4 @entity19 has invested in a purpose built beach - front resort for their team at a cost of £ 25 million - which will open to the public after the @entity32 the training pitches and media centre are just one mile away			1
crucially , the complex – which lies 700 miles north of @entity9 on the @entity37 coast – offers easy security and is a short ride away from the airport , ensuring that the @entity4 players can be delivered to all their games in less than two hours by private jet			2
the base will become a commercial resort when the @entity32 is over			1
by contrast , the @entity7 team face a journey of between one and two hours to their training ground – an army base – and up to three hours to the international airport from their hotel , the four - star @entity54 in @entity9			2
inside , there is cracked paint , a failing internet service and stained carpets			0
the £ 200 - a - night hotel was criticised on @entity61 by one guest who said : ‘ it makes a @entity65 prison seem like a dream destination			2
’ @entity7 's hotel is located within view of the @entity69 in @entity9 where armed gangs are being targeted by police the hotel was named the @entity73 until 2010 when a group of gunmen from a drug gang stormed the lobby , taking 30 guests and staff hostage and killing one woman			0
a worker said : ‘ the hotel was sold and renamed because as you can imagine that incident was n’t very good for business			0
’ a staff member at the @entity54 said rooms were ‘ being renovated ’ but added : ‘ we have another year and a half to go before the building work is complete			0
’ when asked if the hotel would be ready in five weeks when the @entity7 team are due to arrive he shrugged and said : ‘ look around you , what do you think ? we are working very hard to get it ready			0
’ inside a room , large brown stains dotted the blue carpet			0
the bath water took five minutes to run warm and emerged from the tap a dull yellow colour			0
one note of consolation for the @entity7 squad is that the @entity4 resort is n’t yet ready , either			2
while is @entity107 colleagues are stuck in the centre of @entity9 , per mertesacker will be able to enjoy the beach in the @entity4 @entity19 's £ 25 million base 700 miles north of @entity9			1
