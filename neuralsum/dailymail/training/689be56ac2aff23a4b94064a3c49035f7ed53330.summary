@entity0 admits that @entity3 ’s wage demands could rocket should he prove himself as a @entity5 goalkeeper over the next month			1
the 21 - year - old is set for an extended run in the @entity9 team and will make his full professional debut at @entity11			1
@entity3 , though , is out of contract in the summer and , with the @entity13 having already signed @entity15 stopper @entity14 , his future at his hometown club is uncertain			1
but with first - choice goalkeepers @entity18 and @entity19 sidelined until january with ankle and thigh injuries respectively , @entity3 will keep goal through the entire festive period			1
@entity3 impressed against @entity9 and is all set for his @entity5 bow at @entity11 @entity3 is congratulated by @entity26 after the @entity27 inflicted a first defeat of the season on @entity30 should he impress – as he did during the second half of last weekend ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity30 – then contract talks will open in the @entity34			1
and @entity0 says the young custodian could well be in a position of power			1
‘ i think @entity3 knows this is a real game changer for him , ’ said the @entity39 boss , who yesterday collected the @entity40 for november			2
‘ it can be seven games , roughly , he might have in goal and it ’s a great opportunity for him			2
‘ who knows ? after five or six we might be kicking ourselves that we did n’t give him a contract			0
it might have been cheaper ! ‘ but the ball is very much in @entity3 ’s court and that ’s where it will stay until such time as the two goalies come back and we make a decision			1
’ @entity3 had been in the shadows for five years at @entity60 before his half - time introduction against the @entity62			2
but @entity0 says nothing will faze the younger brother of former @entity66 and @entity67 keeper , @entity65			2
‘ everyone who interviewed him after the game will say he ’s a humble guy , ’ he said			2
‘ he ’s got no delusions of grandeur but he also believes he ’s ready			0
although he ’s very young to be goalkeeper of @entity9 he ’s confident he can do the job and let ’s hope he can			1
’ @entity0 was voted november 's manager of the month after turning @entity9 's fortunes around another player in a similar situation to @entity80 is @entity81			1
his deal is also up at the end of the season but @entity0 believes that has been the motivating factor behind his recent good form			1
‘ i think @entity81 having his contract up at the end of the year is a good thing for him , ’ he said			0
‘ it keeps him hungry			0
he ’s turned the tables a bit for himself			0
that hunger is sometimes a good hunger - let ’s hope he continues on that path			0
‘ but we take risks all the time with contracts			0
sometimes you make those calls because of the personality of the player			0
’ @entity9 fielded five @entity9 – @entity3 , @entity81 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity26 - against @entity30 , and the club has made a deliberate effort to recruit players from within the @entity110 rather than from abroad			1
and @entity0 added : ‘ we ’ve worked very , very hard to get that ( local players ) right and we ’re getting the rewards now			2
‘ it ’s something we decided to do and we felt that sometimes bringing players from all over the world can disrupt it a little bit			0
we ’ll maybe wait until they ’re a little bit older to go and get those guys and keep the other group local and keep the spirit and work ethic here that the area ’s renowned for			0
‘ all those guys that have come through , i ’d be surprised if you could find any of those that you did n’t think was a good person or good character			0
that ’s a part of the academy as well , not just producing players but producing people who are of the right character and right manner			0

@entity3 is set for a spell in @entity9 's team after injuries to @entity18 and @entity142
and @entity0 reckons his wages could skyrocket with talks about a new deal set for january
' the ball is in @entity3 ’s court until the two goalies come back and we make a decision , ' @entity0 said
