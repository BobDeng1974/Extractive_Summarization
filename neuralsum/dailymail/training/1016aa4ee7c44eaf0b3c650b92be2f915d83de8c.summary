by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the integrity of the @entity3 was called into question on tuesday night after @entity6 ’s football federation launched a match - fixing investigation into their own players			1
prompted by allegations that a convicted fraudster had correctly predicted that @entity6 would lose 4 - 0 and have a man sent off in their group match against @entity15 , the national governing body ( @entity17 ) issued an explosive statement on tuesday confirming that their ethics committee would probe claims of fraud by ‘ seven bad apples ’ in their squad			1
@entity44 magazine @entity43 claims to have had a @entity46 conversation with convicted @entity48 match - fixer turned supergrass @entity49 hours before kick - off			1
@entity49 claimed he had not predicted the result of the match before it began			1
@entity49 said : ‘ at no time did i make reference to four goals being scored or to a red card being issued			1
at no time did i suggest that i had any way of corroborating or substantiating what was meant to be an educated guess based on my extensive match - fixing experience			2
‘ i am shocked and amazed that a respected magazine such as @entity43 would go so far as to fabricate statements by yours truly with the visible aim of stirring the row over match - fixing			2
’ but @entity43 stood by their story that led to @entity6 football chief @entity70 , president of @entity17 ’s normalisation committee , instructing their ethics committee to investigate			1
@entity49 is a convicted match - fixer from @entity48 with offences including forgery , assault and burglary on his record			1
he was jailed in his home country for match - fixing in 1995 and claims to have tried to fix @entity82 games that year			0
he later ran his empire from a one - bedroom flat in the shadow of @entity86 , rigging hundreds of matches around the world and making millions of dollars in the process			0
in february 2011 he was arrested in @entity91 and sentenced to two years in prison			0
where is he now ? after serving a year in a @entity91 jail , he was released and turned over to authorities in @entity96 , where he was wanted on further match - fixing charges			0
he is currently being held in jail in @entity99			0
who did he tell ? @entity44 journalist @entity102 wrote , in an article for @entity43 , that he communicated with @entity49 via a @entity46 message			1
the fixer later said he made the comments after @entity6 ’s match against @entity15 , but the @entity44 magazine say they stand by their story			1
and why is this a big deal ? a 2014 report put together by more than 70 international experts over two years estimates that around $ 140billion is laundered through illegal sports betting			0
accused : @entity48 @entity49 is alleged to have predicted @entity6 's 4 - 0 defeat he said : ‘ recent allegations of fraud around @entity6 ’s three preliminary games , especially @entity6 v @entity15 , as well of the “ existence of seven bad apples ” do not reflect the values and principles promoted by our administration , in line with @entity120 and the ethics of our nation			1
‘ we wish to inform the general public that , though not yet contacted by @entity120 in regards to this affair , our administration has already instructed its ethics committee to further investigate these accusations			0
‘ we are strongly committed to employ all means necessary to resolve this disruptive matter without delay			0
in the meantime we legitimately request that any related information , unless brought before our federation and / or its ethics committee , be held for or treated as mere assumption			0
‘ we wish to state that in 55 years of existence , @entity17 has never been sanctioned for , involved in , or even linked to match - fixing or any fraud of any kind			0
’ @entity120 president @entity145 confirmed that he was aware of the allegations on tuesday , but the world governing body issued little more than a holding statement			2
‘ we are not in a position to say whether there are any investigations into the allegations , in order not to jeopardise any future investigation , ’ said a spokeswoman			1
but @entity157 , the @entity158 who has worked in sport integrity at @entity120 and @entity161 and is now the sports integrity director at the @entity163 , suggested these are serious allegations if @entity43 journalist @entity102 did receive the correct prediction from @entity167 before the game on june 18			2
rout : @entity6 imploded against @entity15 in @entity42 and fell to a 4 - 0 defeat clash : @entity171 and @entity172 needed to be separated after confronting each other seeing red : @entity175 was given his marching orders as the @entity33 side surrendered against @entity15 it was an extraordinary tournament for @entity6			1
the squad initially refused to board their flight to @entity181 over a pay dispute			0
and as well as @entity175 ’s first - half dismissal for elbowing @entity185 , the @entity15 game was memorable for @entity172 seemingly trying to head - butt team - mate @entity171			1
it raises the question of whether the @entity190 full back lost his temper because he suspected something to be wrong			0
@entity17 had already launched an investigation into that incident but what makes this controversy more uncomfortable for @entity120 is that hosts @entity181 were in @entity6 ’s group			1
@entity120 ’s security department is also believed to be looking into the claims			0
in his conversation with @entity43 , @entity49 is alleged to have written : ‘ in this team there are seven bad apples			1
’ @entity49 , currently being held in @entity96 and fighting extradition proceedings to face a five - year prison sentence in his native @entity48 , told the magazine he believes @entity6 manipulated all three group games			1
last week @entity120 security director @entity210 said there had been no suspicious betting patterns for any match at the tournament			0
but @entity157 believes it would be wrong to dismiss the story and that @entity120 should instead determine , beyond doubt , @entity49 did communicate his accurate prediction before the game			2
at the same time he would also question how @entity49 was allowed to communicate with journalists when he could be motivated by revenge against those who shopped him to the authorities in @entity91 two months ago and when he is in prison in @entity99			2
@entity157 said : ‘ if it is confirmed that the advice from @entity167 was made before the match and is accurate to the overall result and red card , then this allegation will no doubt be treated extremely seriously by football , governments and beyond			2
‘ i understand that he has made other predictions during this competition that have not proved accurate			0
‘ the advice we have received from the legal or so - called regulated sport betting industry is that there was “ no observable suspicious betting on this match ”			0
‘ but the @entity6 match - fixing case is a grave allegation with an alleged and strong indication of pre-match knowledge from a well - known match - fixer			2

investigation after allegations fraudster @entity49 accurately forecast *humiliating* loss to @entity15
he is also said to have predicted a player would be sent off and @entity175 was later red carded
@entity6 finished bottom of @entity35 after three defeats
