a @entity1 mayor and his wife have been accused of being involved in the disappearance of 43 students who are believed to have been abducted by a drugs cartel			1
@entity6 , who is mayor of @entity7 and his wife @entity8 @entity9 are both accused of having strong links with the @entity12 cartel			1
@entity13 ordered the arrest of the 43 students who were protesting against the drugs gang on september 26 , who were then handed over to the cartel			1
since the abductions , protests in the city have become increasingly violent with the burning of @entity7 's city hall			0
the protests have prompted @entity1 authorities to act and find the missing students			2
attorney general @entity42 said on wednesday that investigators had found a total of nine mass graves containing 30 sets of human remains during the hunt for the missing students			0
he said officials were waiting for a second round of dna tests , after a first round determined they were n't the bodies of the students			2
while the students remain missing , @entity42 said the arrests of @entity7 police officers and the leader of the @entity12 gang , @entity58 , had provided more evidence about the events leading up to their disappearance			1
@entity42 said the students , who attended a radical rural teachers college , had gained the enmity of @entity7 mayor @entity6 because of a previous demonstration in the city			1
he said @entity69 ordered police to detain students who hijacked four buses because the mayor thought they were going to try to disrupt a speech by his wife , @entity77 @entity76			1
@entity69 , his wife and the @entity7 police chief are all fugitives			1
a total of 52 people , including police officers , @entity7 officials and gang members , have been arrested in the case			1
thousands of people took to the streets of @entity7 to protest about the abduction of the missing students authorities had previously reported that the mayor 's wife , @entity76 , had family ties to @entity12			1
but @entity42 said it was much more than that , reporting that @entity58 , the arrested drug gang leader , said she was ' the main operator of criminal activities ' in @entity7			2
@entity58 also said the mayor had gotten payments of 2 million to 3 million pesos ( $ 150,000 - $ 220,000 ) every few weeks , as a bribe and to pay off his corrupt police force			1
after @entity7 police picked up the students , @entity42 said , the youths were taken to a police station and then to the nearby town of @entity107			2
at some point they were loaded aboard a dump truck and taken — apparently still alive — to an area on the outskirts of @entity7 where the mass graves have been found , he said			0
at that point , @entity58 told authorities , one of his lieutenants told him the students were members or sympathizers of a rival gang , the attorney general said			2
investigators discovered a mass grave containing 30 bodies although dna tests confirmed they were not the missing students although further tests are being carried out in a bid to determine their identity since the abductions , protests have turned increasingly violent with mobs attacking government buildings the families claim that @entity69 colluded with the drug cartel and is responsible for the abductions @entity12 had sufficient money to bribe the mayor and local police force because they have increasingly turned to the lucrative practice of growing opium poppies and sending opium paste to be refined for heroin destined for the @entity144 market , according to a @entity1 official			1
the official said @entity12 started turning more to opium after income from marijuana trafficking dropped , apparently because of legalisation of the drug in some @entity144 states			2
after paying local farmers to grow opium poppies in the rough mountains around @entity7 , the gang warehoused and shipped the opium out to other regions to be refined , the official said			0
he said : ' they stockpiled the paste ; they sell it to other criminal organisations			0
' the cartel forces @entity1 farmers to grow illegal drugs instead of legal crops according to investigators meanwhile , @entity1 security forces have arrested the wife of one of the country 's most wanted drug cartel bosses , @entity173 , authorities in the violent western state of @entity170 said on wednesday			1
a spokeswoman for state prosecutors in @entity170 said @entity178 was caught on a highway inside @entity170 , where the gang led by @entity173 known as the @entity181 has posed a major security challenge to president @entity183			0
@entity178 was detained on a road connecting @entity185 with the country 's second biggest city @entity188 , the spokeswoman said , adding that she had no further details			0
@entity183 launched an offensive against the @entity181 at the beginning of 2014 , capturing or killing many of the gang 's leaders			0
however , @entity173 , also known as ' @entity195 ' , has eluded the government 's attempts to capture him			0
until the crackdown in @entity170 in january , @entity173 , 48 , was the most visible cartel boss in @entity185 , appearing in a number of videos posted online in which he sought to justify the gang 's actions			0
he even gave some interviews to international media			0
@entity1 media has reported that @entity178 was @entity173 's first wife , and the mother of several of his children			0
the spokeswoman said it is not clear whether the two have stayed married .			0
