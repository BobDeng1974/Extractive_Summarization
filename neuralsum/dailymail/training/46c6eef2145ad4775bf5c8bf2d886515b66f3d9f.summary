‎ @entity21 yesterday revealed she is in contact with a team of experts desperately working to try to save her husband			1
‎ in order to maximise the chance of mr @entity17 surviving , she is refusing to talk in detail about his plight with even her closest family and friends , believing any slip ups by her could affect whether he lives or dies			1
despite ' @entity52 ' indicating her husband would be his next victim , mrs @entity21 suggested she still has hope he will be saved by a rescue squad			1
‎ ' i do n't want to have any contact with anyone who is not involved in working to get my husband free , ' she said			1
