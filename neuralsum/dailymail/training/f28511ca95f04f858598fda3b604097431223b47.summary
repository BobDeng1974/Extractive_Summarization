by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 19:08 est , 9 august 2013 with the spectre of redundancy hanging over them , council workers were no doubt filled with trepidation when an email from their boss landed in their inbox			1
but the civil servants were left aghast when environment chief @entity11 signed off his update on plans to slash jobs by chatting about his upcoming wedding , honeymoon and favourite punk rock bands			1
now mr @entity11 , director of @entity19 ’s environment department , is being compared to comic character @entity20 for his insensitivity			1
' inappropriate ' : @entity11 ( left ) , head of @entity19 's environment department , has been compared to @entity20 ( right ) after telling staff about his holiday in an email about redundancies he told workers they ‘ may or may not be directly impacted ’ by the authority ’s restructuring plans , adding : ‘ if you are involved i can fully appreciate the concerns you will have and just ask for your patience			1
’ but his e-mail then started to echo the character played by @entity35 in @entity36 , when he gave miffed workers a run down of his social life			1
it said : ‘ on the home front ; off to a punk rock festival in @entity45 this friday			1
@entity41 , @entity42 and the @entity43 are amongst the acts playing so those old enough may remember them			0
i am really looking forward to it as it forms a big part of my past			0
’ he then added : ‘ wedding six weeks this saturday followed by two weeks in @entity52 ! ! ca n’t wait			0
’ mr @entity11 ’s chummy email , sent on monday , was received less than enthusiastically by his 200 staff			1
one said : ‘ the restructure affects everybody			0
many job titles have changed and staff have to reapply for their own jobs , if they still have them			2
so not good times for @entity19 employees			0
’ message : the full email @entity11 sent to staff in @entity19 's environment department @entity67 boss @entity66 , @entity69 ’s north west secretary , agreed the email was ‘ inappropriate ’			1
‘ it is a bit @entity20 , ’ mr @entity66 said			1
‘ he probably meant it well but has underestimated the impact of these changes on his staff			2
‘ i recognise there is a style of management where you do n’t want to appear overly - autocratic , but talking about your plans when people ’s livelihoods are in the balance is not a good idea			0
’ in one episode of the popular @entity87 comedy , @entity20 famously announced to staff they were being made redundant by saying he had ‘ good news and bad news ’			1
the apparent good news was that he himself was being promoted			0
mr @entity11 , who joined @entity19 straight from school in the early 80s , is responsible for waste , roads and recycling in @entity98 ’s second - biggest council			1
the authority , which needs to cut 200 jobs this year to save £ 18.8million , said the senior manager was responding to staff feedback which called for more ‘ personalised ’ messages			2
festival : mr @entity11 told staff he was off to @entity45 to see punk bands including @entity42 ( pictured ) and the @entity43 who had formed ' a big part of my past ' a spokesman said : ‘ @entity11 has been employed by @entity19 since he was taken on as an apprentice and has worked at virtually every level of the organisation			1
he has known many of our staff for 20 years			2
‘ these are tough times in local government			0
we ’re trying to communicate with employees as best we can while we go through difficult changes			0
‘ @entity11 meant no harm and is sorry if he ’s caused offence on this occasion			2
he has an excellent record of handling staffing issues seriously and sensitively			0
’ one of mr @entity11 ’s colleagues added : ‘ @entity11 is a decent bloke			2
he is not one of your typical town hall bureaucrats			0
he worked his way up after starting as an apprentice			0
‘ probably he should have realised the tone was totally wrong , but he would n’t have meant any offence			0
’ mr @entity11 ’s gaffe came as it emerged the chief executive of another company told staff they had lost their jobs by saying an ‘ opportunity ’ had arisen for them to start looking for new work			1
@entity144 , of internet firm @entity145 , informed workers the business would be losing 100 workers in its @entity151 office to allow it to focus more on the @entity152 , according to @entity155 ’s @entity154 newspaper			2
in an email mr @entity144 said : ‘ directly after this meeting you will learn what category your job falls into and whether you will have the opportunity to start your new job search immediately			0

@entity11 told workers about his upcoming holiday in redundancy email
he also told staff about a punk rock festival he was attending in @entity45
@entity67 boss has compared him to comic character @entity20
