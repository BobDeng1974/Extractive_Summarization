this incredible image shows how our skies will look when the @entity4 galaxy collides with our cosmic neighbour , the @entity3 , in four billion years			1
astronomers at @entity7 have confirmed that , according to their latest models , a major collision will occur in a major cosmic event			0
the head - on encounter is expected to happen four billion years from now - catapulting our sun to another area of the galaxy , with stars tossed on to different orbits , astronomers at the @entity18 revealed on thursday			1
starting off as a tiny speck in the distance , the galaxy known as @entity3 ( left of the picture ) looks harmless at first previously just a small dot , earthlings of the future would be forgiven for panicking as @entity3 moves closer to our galaxy the formerly tiny galaxy now dominates the foreground of the computer generated image as it swallows up the @entity4 the aftermath : following the collision of the two galaxies , a countless number of stars will be sent spinning into space as @entity3 and the @entity4 lose their previous forms although @entity40 and its solar system wo n't be destroyed , it will be pushed away from the galactic core more than it is now			1
' after nearly a century of speculation about the future destiny of @entity3 and our @entity4 , we at last have a clear picture of how events will unfold over the coming billions of years , ' said @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity52 - based institute			1
after the @entity3 finally strikes the @entity4 , it will be another two billion years before the two totally come together and form a single elliptical galaxy			1
colossal : this @entity7 illustration shows the @entity4 ( left ) and the @entity3 , which are expected to collide in four billion years from now impact : @entity40 wo n't be destroyed when @entity3 smashes into the @entity4 ( pictured ) , but stars will likely be tossed into different orbits and it will take an additional two billion years for the two galaxies to totally merge a mutual pull of gravity is bringing the two galaxies together as @entity3 , known to scientists as @entity3 , falls at a ferocious rate toward the @entity4			1
@entity3 is currently 2.5million light - years away			2
' in the ' worst - case scenario ' simulation , @entity3 slams into the @entity4 head - on and the stars are all scattered into orbits , ' said team member @entity69 in a statement			1
the @entity3 is plowing toward @entity40 's galaxy at roughly 250,000 miles per hour			0
that rate is the equivalent of traveling from @entity40 to the moon in an hour			0
astronomers also believe a third , smaller galaxy called the @entity77 will also be a part of the collision and could join the @entity4 and @entity3 mash - up			2
fast : @entity3 ( pictured ) is plowing toward @entity40 's galaxy at roughly 250,000 miles per hour , which is the equivalent of traveling from @entity40 to the moon in 60 minutes it previously had been difficult to determine whether the two galaxies would slam into each other			0
members of the @entity88 team , however , were able to make certain that the two will crash with exact views of @entity3 's sideways motion			0
change : when the two galaxies collide , the sun ( pictured ) will be catapulted across another area of the galaxy ' this was accomplished by repeatedly observing select regions of the galaxy over a five - to seven - year period , ' said the institute 's @entity99 , in a statement			2
the astronomers used extremely powerful cameras to capture the measurements that were crucial to understand the motion of @entity3			0
as the universe expands and accelerates , collisions can happen between two galaxies close together because of the gravity from dark matter around them			0
these types of mergers were more likely to happen in the past when the universe was not as large as it is today .			0

collision between galaxies will happen in four billion years
stars will be tossed into different orbit around @entity4 's core - *including* our @entity123
two billion years later , the two galaxies will ' merge ' into one
