by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity3 activist , could now be removed from his post as @entity5 is expected to impose special measures on six @entity8 schools , three of which are run by him six secular schools at the centre of a plot to introduce hardline @entity14 teaching into classrooms are to be placed in special measures			1
it has been reported that @entity5 inspectors will rate the schools ' inadequate ' after snap inspections this week , which usually leads to a school being placed in special measures , allowing officials to remove senior managers or close the school			1
inspectors were ordered in to the @entity8 schools after a ' @entity28 ' letter was uncovered last month detailing a plot by hardline @entity30 to force moderate and secular headteachers from their posts and install extreme @entity14 teachers in their place			1
today a report published in @entity36 alleges that @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity42 schools will be rated inadequate , the lowest possible score , while @entity45 school is already in special measures			2
if the new @entity5 investigation does place the schools in special measures , @entity1 , who is also governor of @entity48 school , is almost certain to be removed from his post			1
mr @entity1 , an activist for the hardline @entity3 , is alleged to be at the centre of the trjan @entity28 plot , but has denied the allegations , calling them a ' fabrication '			1
according to the @entity5 report , a further nine schools @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity48 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 will be given the second lowest rank of ' requiring improvement '			1
a letter from @entity70 school to parents yesterday confirmed the school had been subjected to a ' malicious and targeted ' attempt to oust senior staff			2
in its statement to parents , @entity77 's governing body confirmed that several headteachers in the city had faced pressure to resign from their posts			0
the school , which is also embroiled in a fraud inquiry into allegedly fake resignation letters , said : ' many of you will now be aware that a number of headteachers across @entity8 have come forward and confirmed that they have experienced malicious and targeted campaigns to remove them and that this issue is not unique to the leadership of @entity94			0
' the seriousness of this issue has now been taken up by the @entity97 who have appointed a new education adviser responsible for investigating this matter thoroughly			2
' @entity101 have also appointed a former head teacher , @entity102 , as @entity8 's chief adviser to assist in a wider investigation			2
' in a picture taken inside @entity108 in 2008 , boys and girls appear to have been segregated in an assembly			0
the school has always maintained segregation was voluntary , but an investigation found it was enforced by teachers @entity108 , along with its two sister schools @entity38 and @entity39 , have bee rated ' inadequate ' by @entity5 inspectors , along with @entity40 and @entity117 the update for parents concluded : ' attempts have been made at @entity70 to destabilise the school by a very small but well organised group of individuals			1
' the governors , headteacher , senior leadership team and staff have been robust in ensuring that @entity58 remains a multi-cultural school providing a safe and positive learning environment for all of our 630 children			2
' four former staff members at the primary school were arrested on thursday and have been bailed pending further inquiries into allegedly forged resignation letters			0
of the 17 schools investigated by @entity5 in connection with the plot , so far only one has been given a clean bill of health though another report is still to be completed			1
meanwhile a @entity97 ( @entity97 ) probe , lead by @entity145 , the former head of @entity147 's anti-terrorism unit , is thought to be looking into 25 schools in the area			2
yesterday @entity36 revealed the @entity97 investigation found boys and girls had been forcibly segregated during lessons , @entity151 students had been left to teach themselves religious education , and any discussion of intimacy or the menstrual cycle had been banned in some classes			1
the probe into @entity108 , @entity38 and @entity39 primary school found that @entity162 , a known @entity163 sympathiser who has previously said gay people should be stoned to death and espoused anti-semetic views , was also invited to speak to children			0
a report from the @entity97 leaked yesterday found that pupils at @entity37 were forcibly segregated and @entity151 students were left to tech themselves			1
the headteacher , @entity171 ( pictured ) was sidelined and eventually resigned pupils at two of the schools said the theory of evolution was only covered ' briefly ' in biology , sex education was banned , and lessons on the arts and literature severely restricted or abandoned			1
despite these restrictions , @entity183 lessons were compulsory for all students			0
pupils were also encouraged to begin and end lessons with prayer , and loudspeakers were used to broadcast calls to prayer			0
the report said headteachers at the schools were marginalised , with @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 in reality being run by @entity1 , who ran the board of governors			2
the headteacher of @entity37 , @entity171 , resigned last month after being reduced to a ' figurehead ' within the school , despite gaining the school an ' outstanding ' @entity5 rating			0
in a statement to @entity204 , the @entity205 said : ' just two years ago @entity37 was the first @entity206 to be rated ' outstanding ' in all categories under the new @entity5 inspection regime			0
' it took more than 10 years to build the school to its outstanding levels , from a situation where children were being failed and the school was in special measures			0
' @entity37 is now the most successful school in @entity217 serving its social group - that is , with 72 % of pupils on free school meals			0
' if the inspectors who carried out both inspections at @entity206 have ignored these achievements then we have to conclude that they are working to a different set of criteria than is normally used for an @entity5 inspection			0
' however , the spokesman refused to comment on the current allegations , saying only that they did not recongise reports that some of the schools would close			0
a spokesman for @entity5 refused to comment on the report , but yesterday a spokesman for the @entity97 said : ' the allegations made in relation to some schools in @entity8 are very serious and we are investigating all evidence put to us in conjunction with @entity5 , @entity101 and the police			1
' it is absolutely vital these investigations are carried out impartially , without pre-judgment			0
@entity101 is also investigating 15 schools , though the @entity97 is thought to be frustrated with attempts by the council to play down what is happening in the schools .			1
