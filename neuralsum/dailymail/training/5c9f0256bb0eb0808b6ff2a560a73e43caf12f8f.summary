there is confusion over who developed a new computer super-virus after some programmers today reportedly said the coding was the same relatively simple language as found in video games like @entity8			1
the suggestion contradicts theories put forward by other experts who only yesterday said the virus , known as @entity13 , was so sophisticated it had to have been developed by some of the world 's top brains at the @entity18 's @entity17			1
to guard against the virus the @entity19 is issuing its ' most serious warning ' , but now some say element of the virus - known as malware - are baffling			2
simplistic : experts have today raised question marks over the sophistication of new computer bug flame , saying sections of the code used to produce it are the same as that used in video games like @entity8 according to msnbc reporter @entity37 the program requires 20 megabytes - a comparably large size for a computer virus and an indicator of sluggish coding			1
furthermore unlike the computer bug @entity42 , @entity13 has so far failed to make a security breach comparable to hacking into a nuclear power plant			0
most notably sections of the code were used the @entity48 programming language which is almost whollly used to create video games such as the hugely popular @entity8			1
warnings have previously been put out claiming that the virus has the capability to cripple nations and the bug has been used to hack into computers in @entity55			2
the sophisticated spyware – said to be about 100 times the size of most malicious software – also hacked other machines in the @entity60 , including @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			0
@entity48 , which was developed in @entity66 , is generally considered to be a simple computer language , developed for the primary purpose of scripting video games			1
according to an @entity72 programmer , quoted by @entity73 , it was ' weird ' to imagine the @entity48 language being used as a tool for spying			1
he said the code was so ' ordinary ' it looked like the efforts of an ' average programmer '			0
dangerous ? this screen grab taken shows a section of code from the computer virus known as @entity13			1
program of the computer virus known as @entity13 the language was named @entity48 after the @entity90 word for moon and reflects the idea of it being used as a subsidiary form of coding to attach satellite projects to bigger bits of software			2
@entity98 , who worked as a security analyst at the @entity17 for eight years , said @entity48 was quite commonly used to power mobile applications such as @entity8			0
mr @entity98 dismissed suggestions that the virus had been released by a government to spy on other nations			2
however , this view is contradicted by those such as @entity108 - based internet security firm @entity107 who has claimed that @entity13 was crafted at the behest of a national government			0
finger - pointing in @entity72 's direction , fuelled by the fact that the majority of cases so far discovered were in @entity55 , have not been strongly disputed as yet , but some believe the middle - east nation lacks the capacity to launch such an cyber attack			1
the argument appears to boil down to two schools of thought			0
some say @entity13 's authors were being exceedingly clever by using an unusual programming language to develop a deadly piece of malware in an attempt to confuse hi - tech security systems			0
others say those behind the superbug were amateurs who did little to do much to cover their tracks .			0

cyber experts refute claims that code is spy tool
same ' simplistic ' language used in video games
suggestion that virus could have come from @entity72
spyware is too big to be *stealth* tool say some experts
