in the depths of an @entity3 rainforest , scientists have identified a fanged amphibian that is the first known frog that gives birth to tadpoles , instead of laying spawn			1
the species was originally discovered decades ago , but it was only after a chance sighting that a scientist recently stumbled across a female with newborn tadpoles with her			2
upon closer inspection , experts found the @entity17 larvaepartus is the only frog out of the world ’s 6,455 species to give birth to tadpoles directly			1
@entity16 ( pictured ) is the only frog out of the world ’s 6,455 frog species to give birth to tadpoles instead of laying spawn			1
while the fanged species was found decades ago , it was only recently that experts have discovered evidence of the creature 's unique birthing ability the unusual member of the @entity36 group of fanged frogs was originally found by @entity3 researcher @entity38			1
usually grey or brown , the species measures between one and two - inches long ( 4cm ) , and weighs less than two - tenths of an ounce ( 5 grams )			0
the frogs live in small streams and puddles in rainforest habitats , doing their best to avoid being eaten by larger fanged frog species , as well as predatory snakes and birds			1
males possess two fang - like projections from the lower jaw that are used in fighting			2
scientists have long theorised that this particular species gives birth to tadpoles , but they had never seen the creatures mate or spawn first - hand			1
the latest discovery was made by @entity61 , herpetologist @entity62			0
he grabbed a frog he thought was male , but instead , he found that it was a female with a dozen newborn tadpoles with her			2
to make the discovery , herpetologist @entity62 grabbed a frog he thought was male , but instead , he found that it was a female with a dozen newborn tadpoles with her			2

the unusual member of the @entity36 group of fanged frogs was originally found by @entity3 researcher @entity38 decades ago unusual features : ' fangs ' for fighting and its ability to give birth to tadpoles - the only known species of frog to do so out of 6,455			1
breeding : the species is one of 12 to have evolved internal fertilisation			1
usually , the male grips the female in amplexus - known as the frog mating embrace - and releases sperm as the eggs are released by the female , outside of her body			0
the eggs , or frogspawn , mature through stages including the aquatic tadpole larval phase , typically limbless with a tail that propels it through the water			0
family : the @entity36 group of fanged frogs @entity109 : @entity3 rainforests in small streams and puddles size : one and two - inches long ( 4cm ) weight : less than two - tenths of an ounce ( 5g ) ‘ reproduction in most frogs could not be more different from human reproduction			2
' in this case , what is most interesting , ironically , is that the reproductive mode is more similar to our own , ’ dr @entity120 said			0
the new evidence of the frog ’s behaviour , witnessed in the @entity76 rainforests , is published in the journal @entity130			0
‘ almost all frogs in the world - more than 6,000 species - have external fertilisation , where the male grips the female in @entity138 ( the frog mating embrace ) and releases sperm as the eggs are released by the female , ’ dr @entity120 said			2
those eggs , or frogspawn , mature through stages including the aquatic tadpole larval phase , typically limbless with a tail that propels it through the water			0
‘ this new frog is one of only 10 or 12 species that has evolved internal fertilisation , and of those , it is the only one that gives birth to tadpoles as opposed to froglets or laying fertilised eggs , ’ he added			1
dr @entity120 said : ‘ it 's totally unclear why this mode of reproduction has not evolved more frequently			0
‘ my favourite topic when it comes to frog evolution and diversification is the bewildering variation in reproductive modes that occur			0
@entity169 exhibit all sorts of interesting twists			0
’ some frogs in @entity173 that also engage in internal fertilisation are known to give birth to froglets that never go through the tadpole stage			1
others carry eggs in pouches on their back , brood tadpoles in their vocal sac or mouth , or transport tadpoles in pouches on their backs and sides			0
two known species of female gastric brooding frogs , both of which are now extinct , were famous for swallowing their fertilised eggs , brooding them in their stomach , and giving birth out of their mouths to froglets			0

*limnonectes* larvaepartus is the only frog species to give birth to tadpoles
it is one of 10 or 12 species that has evolved internal fertilisation
unusual behaviour was *studied* in the @entity3 rainforest
males have two ' fangs ' that are used in fighting to avoid being eaten
