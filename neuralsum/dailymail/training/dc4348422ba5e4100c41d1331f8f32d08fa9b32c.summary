in the largest analysis of smoke - free legislation to date , @entity18 researchers found the more stringent the laws , including those for workplaces , restaurants and bars , resulted in the highest health benefits			1
the research , published in the @entity29 journal @entity30 , analysed 45 studies covering the @entity18 and other countries such as @entity33 and @entity34			2
it found heart attack hospitalisations declined by an average of 15 per cent after communities passed laws banning smoking in areas such as restaurants , bars and workplaces			1
admissions for strokes declined by 16 per cent , while hospitalisations for respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , were rapidly followed by a 24 per cent decrease in hospitalisation			1
exposure to cigarette smoke induces rapid changes in blood chemistry , making it much more prone to clotting			0
in someone who has narrowed or damaged coronary arteries , smoke exposure can tip the balance and cause a heart attack			0
the findings are consistent with other studies that have found smoking bans are linked with a decline in cardiac problems			0
@entity66 figures found the number of heart attacks in @entity69 plummeted by 10 per cent in the year after the ban was imposed in july 2007			1
a similar drop was also recorded in @entity72 where another study discovered a 14 per cent decrease in the year after the ban was introduced there			0

‘ restrictions on smoking in public can help smokers to cut down or quit as well as reducing our exposure to second hand smoke			0
' this study provides encouraging data about the benefits of a smoke - free environment on our heart health and shows that the right decision was made five years ago			2
‘ if we want this downward trend to continue , policy makers should introduce further measures to reduce the appeal of smoking , such as plain , standardised packaging for tobacco			0

the more stringent the laws , the better the health benefits , @entity18 researchers found
hospital admissions for heart attacks fell by 15 ***%*** , strokes by 16 ***%*** and those for respiratory diseases such as asthma by 24 ***%***
