he wants a new striker , a holding centre - midfielder and a right - back			1
hitman : @entity57 striker @entity17 ( centre ) remains a top target for @entity0 combative : @entity1 is also taking a keen interest in @entity61 midfielder @entity18 ( right ) up front : @entity63 striker @entity62 is likely to be up for grabs , with @entity0 interested @entity63 ’s @entity62 and @entity57 ’s @entity17 are among @entity1 ’s top striker targets			1
@entity61 ’s @entity18 and @entity67 ’s @entity66 are midfielders who have been watched extensively by the @entity70 scouts , while @entity72 ’s @entity71 , @entity67 ’s @entity73 and @entity75 ’s @entity74 are right - back options should @entity47 depart			1

they never say what you have done			0
‘ i believe as well that the quality of the club is its consistency			0
the special players help you to win trophies , but the quality of consistency is important for a club			0
‘ and on that front , we ’ve been better than everybody			0
there are only two clubs in @entity121 who have qualified for the @entity123 for 17 seasons consecutively			0
‘ that consistency demands special values inside the club			0
i work seven days a week because i want to win			0
‘ unfortunately you do n’t win on command			0
our job is very easy when we win things			0
when we do n’t win , we need some strength to continue to grow			0
‘ some clubs have n’t won a trophy for 20 years and they do n’t get that question			0
‘ this is my 14th cup final and i fight very hard to win , doing everything every day of my life to try to win			0
if i do n’t manage to do it , it ’s not because of a lack of commitment			0
