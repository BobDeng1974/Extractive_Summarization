by @entity0 astronomers have spotted a rare picture of a nebula that looks uncannily like an engagement ring			2
captured using using @entity6 ’s @entity5 in @entity7 spotted planetary nebula @entity9 33 was created when an aging star blew off its outer layers			1
the bubble is , by chance , aligned with a foreground star , and bears an uncanny resemblance to a diamond engagement ring			2
' this cosmic gem is unusually symmetric , appearing to be almost circular on the sky , ' said the @entity19 , which revealed the image			0
being perfectly round is uncommon for these objects , say astronomers , usually something disturbs the symmetry and causes the planetary nebula to display irregular shapes			2
most stars with masses similar to that of our @entity37 will end their lives as white dwarfs — small , very dense , and hot bodies that slowly cool down over billions of years			0
on the way to this final phase of their lives the stars throw their atmospheres out into the space and create planetary nebulae , colourful glowing clouds of gas surrounding the small , bright stellar relics			0
the image , captured by @entity6 ’s @entity5 ( @entity5 ) , shows the remarkably round planetary nebula @entity25 33 , located roughly 2500 light - years from @entity26			1
being perfectly round is uncommon for these objects — usually something disturbs the symmetry and causes the planetary nebula to display irregular shapes			0
' the strikingly bright star located along the rim of the nebula creates a beautiful illusion , ' said @entity19			1
' this is just a chance alignment — the star , named @entity62 , lies in the foreground of the nebula , between @entity26 and @entity25 , in just the right place to make this view even more beautiful			1
' together , @entity67 and @entity25 create a sparkling diamond ring			1

on the way to this final phase of their lives the stars throw their atmospheres out into the space and create planetary nebulae , colourful glowing clouds of gas surrounding the small , bright stellar relics			0
the remnant of @entity25 ’s progenitor star , on its way to becoming a white dwarf , can be seen just slightly off - centre inside the nebula , visible as a tiny white pearl			1
this wide - field view shows the sky around the planetary nebula @entity25 33 , which appears as the ghostly blue circle near the centre of the picture			1
the bright orange star at the top is @entity100 , which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye			0
it is still bright — more luminous than our own @entity37 — and emits enough ultraviolet radiation to make the bubble of expelled atmosphere glow			0
@entity25 is just one of the 86 objects included in astronomer @entity109 's 1966 @entity108 of @entity110			1
@entity25 also scoured the skies for galaxy clusters , compiling the @entity108 of over 4000 of these clusters in both the northern and southern hemispheres of the sky .			2

@entity6 ’s @entity5 in @entity7 captured nebula with star in front of it
called @entity25 33 , nebula is located roughly 2500 light - years from @entity26
