by @entity1 reporter published : 13:16 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 13:16 est , 25 july 2013 another mystery coffin has been found in a tomb next to @entity5 's final resting place			1
archaeologists discovered the 600 - year - old casket yesterday morning beneath a second lead coffin , believed to hold medieval knight sir @entity9			1
site director @entity10 , who discovered the former king last august , said the latest development is rare and exciting			2
mr @entity10 said : ' for me , this is more exciting than @entity5 the lead - lined coffin was discovered when the first excavation was carried out last year but it was left undisturbed while work concentrated on the king 's burial spot ' i think that 's because there was n't that expectation to find @entity5 - we never thought we would actually uncover him			1
' here , we have an element of mystery , we do n't really know who 's inside			0
' i just have n't come across a stone tomb with an interior lead coffin before			1
' you can tell it 's a high - status grave because of the expense of the lead and the effort of making the stone tomb			1
' we ca n't really be sure about what 's happened to the grave over the past 600 years , but the lid of the coffin does n't match the rest of it and there 's some damage to the mortar so it looks like it might have been opened			0
' @entity5 's remains were discovered underneath a car park in @entity48 last year eight people were needed to lift the stone lid of the 14th century coffin , which will now go to the @entity48 for analysis			1
the remains are encased in 5mm - thick lead			2
but the exposed feet , and some damage to the lead , suggest the corpse was dug up and reburied hundreds of years ago			0
a crucifix embellished on the lid suggests religious valuables may have been placed in the coffin but removed some time later , according to lead diggers			1
the team discovered the tomb containing the lead coffin last august but recovered it to concentrate on excavating @entity5 the casket is the first fully intact stone coffin found in @entity48 , and is likely to contain a high - status burial – although experts do not know who is buried within			1
@entity72 site director @entity71 , of the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) , said : ' @entity75 coffins are unusual in @entity48 – and this is the first time we have found a fully intact stone coffin during all our excavations of medieval sites in the city			1
' experts suspect the grave could belong to one of three prestigious figures known to buried at the friary			0
these include two leaders of the @entity88 order - @entity87 , who died in 1272 , and @entity9 of @entity89 , who died in 1330			0
records also suggest the friary contains the grave of ‘ a knight called @entity94 , sometime mayor of @entity48 ’			2
this may be 14th century knight sir @entity96 of @entity97 , who died between 1356 and 1362			0
the @entity73 team also hope the dig will help to uncover more details about @entity5 ’s burial and its place within the @entity72 church , as well as a much clearer picture of the church ’s layout , dimensions and architecture			1

the story suggests they met their end after they subscribed to the rumour that the deposed @entity132 was still alive and were providing money for rebels who aimed to topple his successor , @entity128 archaeologists have made a large trench measuring 25m by 17m around the area where @entity5 ’s skeleton was found			2
they has uncovered the north - east end of the church , including the choir area and the walking place around the main tower of the building			0
the trench runs between @entity147 ’s @entity72 car park and the neighbouring car park of the former @entity149			1
@entity5 was discovered squashed into a very small and badly prepared ' lozenge ' - shaped pit as gravediggers rushed to bury him @entity5 was identified by analysing his his curved spine - he was reputed to have a hunched back - and the injuries he was reported to have sustained			1
during the latest dig , archaeologists will make a large trench measuring 25m by 17m around the area where his skeleton was found it was one woman 's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of @entity168 @entity167 said she felt a chill on a hot summer 's day in 2009 as she walked through the area where it was thought he was buried			0
miss @entity167 initially funded the excavation of what is now a @entity147 car park because she was ' 99 per cent certain ' that the remains were those of @entity5			1
the team have secured permission to remove part of the @entity183 wall separating the two areas			0
the site of @entity5 ’s burial place has been temporarily secured to protect it from the digging work during the excavation			2
@entity190 , lead archaeologist , said : ' we hope this dig will expand the context of @entity5 ’s grave			2
we also want to preserve the grave ’s relationship with the rest of the site			0
we want to leave some evidence of later activities on the site - including how close it was to the @entity183 outhouse			0
' what drives us with the project is learning more about medieval @entity48 and one of its great religious houses			2
' we hope this dig is going to give us a definitive plan of the dimensions and architecture of the church			0
' we may be able to recover more fragments			0
we might learn more about the dissolution of the church , and we might learn more about what was there before the friary			0

remains of @entity5 were discovered under a car park among the ruins of a church in @entity48 last *september*
a stone tomb was *unearthed* when the first excavation was carried out
when moving the top of the tomb a second lead coffin , with what seemed to be the mark of a crucifix on it , was revealed
