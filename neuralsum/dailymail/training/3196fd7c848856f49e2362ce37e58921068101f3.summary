when @entity0 host @entity1 at the @entity2 on sunday , not only will two of the best teams in the @entity4 be going head to head , but two of the league 's brightest stars			1
@entity10 and @entity11 have been the focal points for their sides , plundering 26 league goals between them			1
the two would be almost certain to make up any composite @entity18 , but if you could only have one , who would you choose ? @entity22 's reporters reveal which of the @entity24 duo they would pick ? @entity11 does some fitness work as @entity0 team - mate @entity26 ( right ) watches on @entity10 trains with @entity27 ( centre ) and @entity29 ( right ) last saturday @entity30 - @entity11 it ’s a close call because they are both top - quality players who have the ability to absolutely embarrass defenders with their pace and skill			1
but i think i ’d take @entity11 over @entity10			1
he is in the top three strikers we have ever seen in the @entity4 and has been performing at incredible levels of consistency since he first arrived			0
it ’s still early days for @entity10 , but he has certainly made a stunning start to his career at @entity1			1
@entity46 - @entity11 his hat - trick against @entity48 in the @entity49 at the @entity2 was something special			1
he also kept his cool with the last chance of the game against @entity54 to win the title for @entity0			2
@entity10 has been brilliant for @entity1 but @entity11 is ruthless in front of goal			1
@entity58 - @entity10 this is almost impossible ! in terms of ability , goal - scoring , finishing and technique it ’s hard to split them			2
but if you insist i ’ll go for @entity10 because he ’s injured less and because of the energy he gives to them team			2
like @entity71 , he galvanises the entire team with his pressing			0
it ’s not that @entity11 does n’t do his fair share but @entity10 is exceptional			1
and when you see your star player working that hard , it means every other player has to follow the example			0
@entity81 - @entity10 on current form , it would have to be @entity10 – not least because he can stay fit			2
@entity11 is the better finisher but he missed a large portion of last season with muscle injuries and only returned to action for @entity0 last weekend after another seven - game absence			1
@entity10 has set the @entity4 alight for @entity1 and also offers more in terms of where he can play across the front and work - rate			1
@entity10 has scored 12 @entity4 goals for @entity1 this season since signing from @entity96 @entity11 scores against @entity97 , one of 14 @entity4 goals for the @entity0 star this season @entity11 ( centre ) warms up with his @entity0 team - mates on wednesday as they gear up to face @entity1 @entity10 age : 26 height : 5ft 7in weight : 70kg @entity106 : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 ( loan ) , @entity111 ( loan ) , @entity96 , @entity1 career appearances : 412 goals : 111 2014 - 2015 record : 30 @entity116 18 goals @entity118 : 77 goals : 26 major honours : @entity96 : @entity120 ( 2013 ) , @entity121 ( 2012 ) , @entity122 ( 2011 ) , @entity123 ( 2011 ) , @entity11 age : 26 height : 5ft 8in weight : 74kg @entity106 : @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity0 career appearances : 427 goals : 218 2014 - 2015 record : 22 @entity116 19 goals @entity118 : 59 goals : 22 major honours : a @entity128 : @entity135 ( 2010 ) , @entity122 ( 2010 ) , @entity0 : @entity4 ( 2012 , 2014 ) , @entity136 ( 2014 ) , @entity137 : @entity138 ( 2008 ) @entity139 - @entity11 very close call but the @entity0 striker edges it for me due to his frightening ability to score whatever the circumstances			1
no matter how tight an angle or implausible a path to goal , he finds a way			0
electric speed and mercurial movement over a sustained period			0
although a fearsome forward , @entity10 has found himself shut out on a few occasions when @entity11 would have netted			1
@entity154 - @entity10 @entity11 ’s goal record is unrivalled			1
if he carries on like this , he ’ll be remembered as one of the all - time @entity4 greats			0
but if i had to choose between @entity0 ’s sharp - shooter and @entity10 , i ’d pick the @entity1 man all day and every day			1
@entity10 scores but he offers so much more than that			2
he makes goals , too , his workload is astonishing and he is n’t afraid to get hurt			0
no wonder he ’s quickly emerged as a favourite on the terraces and the first name on @entity171 ’s teamsheet			0
@entity172 - @entity11 when @entity11 is fit and firing he is virtually unstoppable			0
at the start of the season before his injury in december , the @entity0 striker was beginning to be talked about in the same breath as @entity178 and @entity179			0
@entity11 ca n't quite find the consistency of fitness to propel him into the upper echelons			0
while @entity10 is a phenomenal player , he is distinctly a level below @entity11 at 100 per cent			2
@entity184 - @entity10 it 's close , because they are two brilliant footballers			2
but the @entity1 star is more of an all - rounder			0
@entity11 's game is about scoring goals - @entity10 does that and more			1
so @entity10 - but only just			0
@entity192 - @entity11 i love @entity10 's never - say - die attitude			1
his work - rate is phenomenal and he has been the glue to hold @entity1 together this season			0
but i 'd still have @entity11 over him in my team			0
his movement is second to none , his feet are lightning fast and his finishing speaks for itself			0
ca n't i just say both though ? no , ok ... @entity11 it is then			2
@entity11 comes on for @entity207 during @entity0 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity209 - his comeback game from injury @entity10 loses his footing but manages to get a shot off against @entity214 at the @entity215 last week @entity216 - @entity11 @entity0 's talisman has the best strike - rate in @entity4 history among anyone who has played 100 games			1
he is not just the best attacker in @entity224 , he is one of the best in the world and already has two titles under his belt			0
would @entity96 have sold him ? i do n't think so			0
@entity230 - @entity11 @entity10 has been a revelation since arriving at @entity1 but @entity11 edges it for me for his ability to find a goal from nowhere			1
when he 's fit and on it , there 's no better striker in the @entity4			0
@entity237 - @entity10 @entity11 is the better player , yes , but @entity10 does it every week - he 's never injured and has contributed to more than half of @entity1 's goals by scoring or setting them up			1
with @entity11 , you never know when he 's next set for a spell on the sidelines			2
total : @entity245 7 @entity246 5			0

@entity22 's *experts* reveal which of the @entity24 stars they prefer
@entity10 and @entity11 have scored 26 goals between them
@entity0 take on @entity1 at the @entity2 on sunday
read : @entity10 can be as good as me , says @entity256 !
@entity258 calls @entity10 the best in @entity224 ... ahead of @entity11 !
