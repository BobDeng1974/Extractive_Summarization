@entity2 @entity1 gov. @entity0 forcefully pushed back tuesday against his @entity4 lieutenant governor @entity3 , saying it 's ' false and absurd ' to suggest he failed to deploy @entity7 troops monday in downtown @entity8 , @entity2 because the @entity10 administration intervened			1
' politics has nothing to do with what anyone up here is doing , ' @entity0 insisted , referring to police commanders standing behind hi , during a mid-afternoon press conference			2
' politics has not one bit to do with the tasks at hand ... with the seriousness of this mission , ' he said			0
@entity3 had accused the @entity10 administration on monday night of pressuring @entity0 into keeping militarized guardsmen out of the riot zone as buildings in @entity8 burned , police cars were set alight and gunfire pierced the night 's chaos			1
@entity0 also dodged a question on tuesday about whether or not guardsmen were positioned in downtown @entity8 before chaos erupted			1
' politics has not one bit to do with the tasks at hand , ' @entity2 gov. @entity0 insisted when confronted with questions about whether the federal government had leaned on him to keep @entity7 troops out of downtown @entity8 @entity2 lt. gov. @entity3 said monday night that the only reason @entity7 troops were kept out of @entity8 was pressure from the @entity10 administration out of danger : @entity7 troops were stationed everywhere but @entity8 's central business district on monday @entity0 officially mobilized the @entity45 a week ago but their duties on monday were restricted to keeping the peace at a courthouse , patrolling the outskirts of town and preventing disturbances in other suburbs			1
only tuesday morning did the guard 's camouflaged humvees roll down @entity55 where rioters had looted , torched and smashed countless businesses – and fired weapons in the direction of first responders			1
@entity0 sidestepped a reporter 's request to comment on whether @entity64 troops were present on @entity55 , @entity8 's main commercial street , before the grand jury decision was announced monday night			1
he said , however , that 700 guardsmen were deployed monday to 100 locations – mostly command posts – so that other law enforcement personnel were freed up to manage riots			2
@entity0 added that tuesday night 's deployment had been upped to 2,200			1
@entity3 , however , was apoplectic on monday			2
@entity0 ' declared a state of emergency almost a week ago and mobilized the @entity45 , ' he told a @entity74 audience			2
' then they were kept away at the crucial time while @entity8 burned			0
' ' we know they were kept away because they did not come in and stop that from the get - go			0
they were deployed in other parts of the @entity84 region , ' he said			2
' why were they not in there at the first sign of an overturned police car or a smashed police car window with a show of force that would have stopped this ? ' the lawlessness began after a grand jury declined after a grand jury declined to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of a black teen who attacked him			0
@entity100 : this @entity7 humvee was photographed in @entity102 , @entity2 on tuesday – 13 miles away from @entity8 – near the county courthouse where grad jurors made their decision out of @entity8 : these guardsmen were posted in nearby @entity107 , @entity2 on tuesday but never ventured into the urban war zone ' a nation of cowards ' : attorney general @entity111 ( left ) visited @entity8 's city center in late august but reportedly pressured @entity2 gov. @entity0 to keep the @entity45 from following suit rioters burned buildings , fired guns at police officers and firefighters , looted and set police cars ablaze			1
' here 's my question that the governor must answer , ' @entity3 demanded : ' is the reason that the national guard was not in there because the @entity10 administration and the @entity129 leaned on you to keep them out ? ' ' i can not imagine any other reason why the governor who mobilized the @entity45 would not have them in [ downtown @entity8 ] to stop this before it started			1
' @entity3 is a @entity4			2
in @entity2 the two offices are elected separately			0
the @entity10 @entity137 , led by outgoing attorney general @entity111 , expressed frustration a week ago after @entity0 held a press conference to announce that he had called the guard up to active duty			1
a top @entity111 aide called @entity0 's office to relay the message , according to the @entity145			2
' instead of de-escalating the situation , the governor escalated it , ' a @entity137 official told the @entity145			0
' he sent the wrong message			0
the tone of the press conference was counterproductive			0
' wrong neighborhood ? guardsmen kept watch outside a shopping mall on tuesday protecting the system : members of @entity45 patrolled outside the @entity159 before the announcement of the grand jury decision @entity2 gov. @entity0 buckled to pressure from @entity164 and kept his state 's @entity7 unit on the sidelines , according to the lieutenant governor as his town descended into burning chaos , @entity8 mayor @entity169 grew angry at the absence of @entity7 troops			1
he told reporters that he could not reach state government officials to get help			0
' i 've called every number that i 've got ... all i 've been able to do is leave messages , ' he told @entity180 in @entity84			0
' they were deployed at other parts of the @entity84 region ... why were they not in [ @entity8 ] at the first sign of an overturned police car or a smashed police car window with a show of force that would have stopped this ? ' ' i ’ve requested the @entity7 troops to come out from the command post to help restore order along the business district , ' he insisted			1
' we have not seen that			0
' ' it ’s my understanding that the commanders out on the street have requested this , and those calls have gone unheeded at this point			0
... we need to have the governor step up , give us the resources that he ’s promised from the beginning			0

@entity1 gov. @entity0 drew fire from @entity4 lt. gov. @entity3 for calling in the guard but then never deploying them into the riot zone
@entity0 fired back tuesday , calling the accusation ' false and absurd '
@entity3 had pointed *fingers* at attorney general @entity111 and the @entity10 administration , saying they pressured @entity0 to show *restraint*
' i can not imagine any other reason why the governor who mobilized the @entity45 would not have them in [ @entity8 ] to stop this '
guardsmen were deployed to other @entity84 suburbs monday night but only arrived in @entity8 on tuesday morning to survey the *wreckage*
@entity0 dodged a question about whether or not guard troops were on @entity8 's main streets before the chaos erupted
