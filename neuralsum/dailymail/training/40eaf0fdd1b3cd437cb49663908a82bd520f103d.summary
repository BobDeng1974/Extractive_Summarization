there 's nothing like some healthy competition to help two friendly rivals become the stand out achievers in this year 's @entity6			1
@entity9 students @entity7 and @entity10 , who share a love for ancient languages , first met when they entered a @entity14 and @entity15 poetry reading competition two years ago			1
since then , they 've battled it out to one of life 's defining moments - the @entity6 - and between them , they topped the state in nine subjects by studying an average of three to four hours each day			1
but despite their high achieving results , the duo appeared to be stumped when asked to names all the @entity30 sisters on @entity32 's today show this morning			2
today co-host @entity52 asked the boys to list the five @entity30 sister , to which @entity7 was able to identify @entity42 , @entity45 and @entity44 but was unable to name @entity56 and @entity57			2
@entity10 fell silent and readily handed the limelight over to @entity7			1
' i only really know one @entity30 , ' @entity10 told @entity60			0
' honestly , pop culture is n't my strongest point			0
' if there was a @entity6 subject on pop culture i would n't have performed very well			0
' while the two rivals were n't shy in admitting their passion for ancient @entity14 and classical @entity15 , they were quick to acknowledge their defeat when it came to pop culture when asked to list the five @entity30 sister by today co-host @entity52 , the boys appeared to be stumped by the question having competed against each other since year 10 at the @entity14 and @entity15 @entity76 , run by the @entity77 of @entity78 , both students say it 's rare to find someone of the same age who share similar interests			1
suffice to say , @entity7 and @entity10 were n't surprised to cross paths yet again at this year 's @entity85 in course ceremony yesterday and were quite happy to share their success			1
@entity7 , of @entity89 , came first in four subjects : classical @entity15 continuers and extension , modern history and @entity14 extension			1
@entity10 , of @entity95 , came first place in five courses : @entity99 continuers and extension , @entity102 extension 1 and extension 2 and @entity14 continuers			1
while the pair have a history of excellent report cards , neither of them expected to perform as well as they did in their @entity6			0
' it 's really overwhelming in many ways , ' @entity10 said			2
' i wo n't say there was n't any hard work involved but i certainly did n't overexert myself			0
' i do feel a little greedy for taking out first place in five subjects though			0
' the 18 - year - old says he realised his talent for languages at the age of nine			0
' my grandmother taught me @entity99 from a young age and that really sparked my passion for it all , ' @entity10 said			0
@entity7 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) receiving their awards at the @entity85 in course ceremony yesterday @entity7 and @entity10 were among 76,000 students who sat the @entity6 exams this year , 105 of which received first in @entity131 ( pictured ) for @entity132 , he 'll never forget the day he received the exciting news			1
' i remember i was in @entity134 [ @entity135 ] when i got a call telling me that i came first in four subjects , ' he told @entity60			0
' i just could n't believe it and all i could say was " oh my @entity139 , that 's amazing "			0
' the studious pair attribute their achievements to ' consistency '			0
' it 's all about effective preparation and getting the balance right with your level of study instead of cramming it all at the last minute , ' @entity7 said			2
@entity10 agrees and like his competitor , he studied an average of three to four hours each day			0
but this is n't the end of the classical rivalry , as the boys hope to gain admission into @entity159 to study @entity160 and @entity161			2
@entity7 and @entity10 were among 76,000 students who sat the @entity6 exams this year , 105 of which received first in @entity131 awards			1
