@entity5 security forces tried to prevent local people from returning mr @entity6 's body to his home in a nearby village , but after a brief confrontation , they were allowed to pass			1
when @entity2 monks from the @entity10 , the scene of monday ’s self immolation , later attempted to visit mr @entity6 ’s home to pray , they were stopped by security and forced to pray by the roadside			2
free tibet director @entity56 said : ' @entity6 is the second @entity2 to set himself on fire in @entity10 in two days			0
' like many tibetans in the last eighteen months , he set himself on fire in front of a government building that symbolises @entity5 ’s occupation			0

' military control : locals facing a standoff with the @entity5 security forces , who tried to prevent them from returning mr @entity6 's body to his village prayers prevented : monks from nearby @entity10 tried to visit @entity6 's village to pray for him , but were stopped en - route by military personnel and made to pray by the roadside holy place : the @entity2 city of @entity10 can be seen in the background of the @entity10 , which is one of the largest in @entity82 @entity5 maintains that @entity11 has always been part of its territory , but many @entity2 say the @entity33 region was virtually independent for centuries until @entity5 troops invaded in the 1950s			1

the first self - immolation in connection with the fight for an independent @entity11 was reported in 2009			0

the escalation of self - immolation since 2011 is a result of further @entity5 government clampdowns on the @entity2 people			1
the @entity5 response to protests has in turn fuelled further grievances , which have lead to the increase in self - immolations as the desperate @entity2 see no other way of having their voices heard , @entity36 said			2
apart from cases where @entity2 have set themselves alight in pairs , @entity36 have no indications that the self - immolations are anything but individuals acting on their own accord			2
the controversial method of protest is much debated among @entity2 themselves			0
some @entity151 say suicide is violence , and therefore unacceptable , while others see self - sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate .			0
