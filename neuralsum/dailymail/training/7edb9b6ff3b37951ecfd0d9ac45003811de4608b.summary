by @entity0 at age 18 , @entity1 was faced with a terrifying prospect when a genetic test for a potentially deadly cancer gene came back positive			1
@entity1 , who lost her mother to breast cancer 14 years ago , chose life , becoming one of the youngest women in @entity11 to undergo a prophylactic double mastectomy			1
on may 10 , the vivacious young woman flashed a smile and two thumbs up as she was wheeled out of @entity16 in @entity11 a day after the long - awaited operation			0
bold move : @entity1 , 20 , pictured left before her preventative double mastectomy and right two days after the surgery under the knife : @entity1 , pictured with @entity22 player @entity22 , went in for surgery at @entity16 earlier this month , two years after taking a genetic test since learning of the ' enemy within ’ two years ago , @entity1 has willingly become a poster girl for genetic testing , encouraging 20 - somethings and even teenagers to be proactive about their health			1
given her family history , for @entity1 the decision to undergo a double mastectomy as a preventative measure was a no - brainer			1
cancer has been a part of her life since age six when her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.at age 38 , @entity39 lost her battle with the deadly disease			1
her aunt , @entity45 , succumbed to the same illness a short time later			0
@entity1 spent a part of her childhood in hospitals with her dying mother and for many years was certain that she too was destined to die from cancer			2
then two years ago , the high school senior learned of an early detection test that can determine if a patient has the @entity56 and @entity57 genetic mutations linked to higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers			2
ms @entity1 and two of her surviving aunts took the test			0
three days after her 18th birthday , @entity1 got the results , which turned out to be positive , @entity64 reported			0
living in fear : @entity1 lost her mother and aunt to breast cancer , and she was certain as a child she she too will die from the same illness the teenager cried and hugged a teddy bear given to her by her mother , she told @entity74 , but she expected this outcome all along			1
' i went in to the testing thinking , “ ok i ’m positive and if i ’m negative , that ’s a nice surprise , ” ' she told @entity79			0
the other thought that kept nagging at @entity1 was : if only genetic testing was available when her mother was still alive			2
@entity1 was reassured by her doctor that she would not need surgery until age 30 , but given her mother 's young age at the time of her diagnosis , she was not going to sit around and wait for cancer to strike			1
she knew at once that she was going to have her breasts removed , and she was going to do it as soon as possible			0
last july , she made an appointment with the surgeon who operated on her aunt			0
at first , he dismissed the idea of performing a bilateral mastectomy on a 20 - year - old , but after talking to ms @entity1 about her family ’s fraught medical history , the physician came around			2
the surgery performed earlier this month was fully covered by @entity1 ’s medical insurance			2
afterwards , she told reporters she was feeling sore , but satisfied with the outcome			0
moment of truth : three days after her 18th birthday , @entity1 learned that she carries the @entity56 genetic mutation linked to 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer decisive : doctors told the 20 - year - old college junior she could wait until she turns 30 and has children to have the surgery , but @entity1 convinced them she had no time to waste given her family history around the time of her 21st birthday this coming august , @entity1 will be back in the hospital for breast reconstructive surgery			1
@entity1 , a junior at @entity121 , is not planning to let her genes stop her in her tracks			2
she aspires to become a special education teacher , earn a phd and have no fewer than four children			1
the 20 - year - old @entity128 resident is marching in the footsteps of @entity131 star @entity130 , who famously opted to have her breasts removed last year upon learning that gene mutations increased her risk of contracting breast cancer to 87 per cent			1
star power : oncologists have noticed that a growing number of young women have been undergoing double mastectomies since @entity130 had the surgery last year doctors have noticed a sharp spike in double mastectomies after @entity130 's highly publicized surgery , which has been a cause for concern in the medical community , especially when it comes to young women like @entity1			1
a recent study found more than two - thirds of women who had both breasts removed after a cancer diagnosis did not have a medical reason for doing so			2
the research showed that of 1,447 women treated for breast cancer , almost 8 per cent had undergone a double mastectomy			1
but 69 per cent of these women who underwent removal of the unaffected breast at the same time had no genetic or family risk factors			0
on her part , @entity1 has made it clear that she does not encourage young girls , including her own 17 - year - old sister , to rush to the nearest hospital to have a double mastectomy			1
the decision to go under the knife was all her own , and her father , @entity173 , supported his daughter 's choice			0
. @entity1 explained that she did not want to wait until she had kids , like her doctors had suggested , because she said she did not want them to have the kind of childhood she had , whiling away the hours in hospital rooms			0
‘ if you had a bomb strapped to your body , would you wait or would you try to dismantle it ? that ’s how i explain it , and it usually gets people on my side , ’ she said			0
in her quest to spread the word about genetic testing , @entity1 has been giving interviews and holding press conferences			0
she and her father also signed up to be in a new documentary called @entity198 and @entity199 about the brca mutation gene .			0

at age 18 , @entity1 found out from genetic test that she has brca gene mutation *responsible* for 87 per cent chance of contracting breast cancer
@entity1 , a junior at @entity121 , lost both her mother and aunt to the illness as a child
the aspiring special education teacher underwent double mastectomy earlier this month and plans to have reconstructive surgery in the *summer*
@entity130 famously had her breasts surgically removed last year after genetic test came back positive for @entity57
