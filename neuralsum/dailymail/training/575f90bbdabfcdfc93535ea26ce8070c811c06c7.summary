in the @entity2 books , the magical @entity0 reveals the whereabouts of characters as they roam the halls and classrooms of @entity8 school			1
and now a team of engineers has created technology that has the potential to work in the same way , but for any building around the globe			0
called @entity17 , the software combines @entity19 signals , gps , and phone sensors to map indoor locations such as shopping malls , help people find items in supermarkets and even track people in a crowd			1
the @entity17 software , from @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , helps app developers map indoor locations			1
it combines real - time @entity19 signals , gps and sensors in phones to calculate accurate points , which could help people navigate shopping centres , find items in supermarkets and locate people in crowds it was created by @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , and can be added to any @entity45 app. gps systems typically rely on having a good line - of - sight to the sky and the satellites that provide it with its positioning information			1
and while these systems do work , to an extent , indoors , the accuracy and reliability is poor because walls and roofs block this view			0
once installed onto an app , @entity30 ’s software begins by checking @entity20 , it then combines this with real - time @entity19 signals			1
these signals reveal the location of routers , for example , and the distances that devices are away from signal hubs			2
it then uses what ’s known as pedestrian dead reckoning			0
this uses motion sensors and compasses built into devices to determine not only the person ’s location , but also plot their movements			0
this is based on the speed they are walking for example , and the angle they 're travelling			0
this information is ultimately uploaded to @entity30 ’s cloud - based positioning centre to calculate an accurate indoor location			2
@entity30 claims the technology is accurate to around 16ft ( five metres ) for a busy location , but this accuracy is improved depending on the number of @entity19 signals , for example			1

‘ it ’s a useful technology for public venues , hotels and shopping malls , enabling people to quickly find their way to the destination , ’ said @entity137 , director of product line for location			2
‘ an example use case is an airport ; using this technology in an airline application would allow the airline to offer guidance through the airport , indicate how long it will take to walk to the gate from their current location , notify gate changes with maps and what documentation they need in hand as people walk towards security			0
the @entity163 ( pictured ) is a fictional map of @entity8 as featured in the @entity2 franchise			1
it tracks the location of every person in the grounds , shown as footprints labelled with the person 's name ( pictured ) @entity30 told @entity172 the uses of the software are determined by the app , meaning it has the potential to track individual people - but only where the developers and users allow			1
for example , the technology could be used by a dating app to track nearby singles , or a parent could use it to track their child in a crowd ‘ it would [ also ] allow the airline to understand where their passengers spend time at the airport or get lost			0

it could additionally be used to target people with specific adverts or promotions			0
the users need to grant permission for any app running the software to be able to do this , and none of the user ’s information is shared with @entity30 .			2

the @entity17 software helps app developers map indoor locations
it use @entity19 signals , gps and phone sensors to calculate accurate points
this could help people navigate shopping centres , find items in supermarkets and locate people in crowds
system is *similar* to that seen in @entity2 's fictional @entity163
