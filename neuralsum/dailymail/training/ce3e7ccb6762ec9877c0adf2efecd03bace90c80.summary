within minutes of returning from intensive training runs , @entity5 , 29 , finds his eyes swell up so much he can barely see			1
and as the extreme puffiness takes up to three days to go down , medical physicist @entity5 is embarrassed to face his colleagues at work because they think he 's been in a fight			1
an eyesore : @entity5 is ashamed of his face when suffering an uncomfortable flare - up @entity5 's wife @entity15 ( right ) believes he suffering with urticaria , more commonly known as hives			1
the allergic reaction , which also causes his whole body to come out in pink bumps , has baffled @entity5 's @entity22 wife @entity15 , 30			1
@entity5 , who lives in @entity23 , said : ‘ it only ever happens when i run really hard , nothing else brings it on			1
‘ i know it 's not hayfever because it happens at all times of year and it 's not an allergy to sweat because it never happens with other sports			0
‘ i 've joined @entity35 running club and the other day i did their three mile club race and really went for it , sprinting at the end			0
‘ within ten minutes of finishing i could feel my eyes starting to itch and then they just blew up - i could hardly see			1
' i look absolutely ridiculous and it 's really embarrassing - i end up trying not to make eye contact with anyone			2
@entity5 has tried taking antihistamines , but they make no difference during flare - up			1
@entity15 believes @entity5 's allergic reaction is exercise - induced urticaria , more commonly known as hives			1
@entity52 ( left ) and @entity5 ( centre ) , pictured here with @entity5 's wife @entity15 ( right ) , were the best of friends			1
indeed there is a specific type of urticaria called exercise urticaria			2
exercise triggers the flare - up because it stimulates the activity of mast cells , a type of connective tissue cell			0
when the cells are put under stress , such as when a person is training intensively , they release a substance called histamine			2
it is this chemical that triggers the swelling @entity5 , who works at @entity74 in @entity75 , said he has suffered the allergic reaction about 20 times and it always occurs after pushing himself particularly hard during a run			1

the epic challenge is half the distance of a full @entity79 and involves a 1.2 mile swim , a 56 mile bike ride and a 13.1 mile run			0
@entity5 , who met @entity52 while they were both students at @entity106 , said : " @entity52 did a full @entity79 last year and i know he would be laughing his head off at us all doing this			1
' he was someone who lived life to the full , not only in terms of his amazing achievements but also in his home life			0
' he always had warm words and a huge smile for his friends and family and was such an uplifting and positive person to be around			0
' he was totally inspirational and i 'm truly privileged to have called him my friend			0
' @entity52 , who worked as an engineer for @entity123 , died in hospital four days after the accident and saved the lives of two other people by donating his organs after his death			2
