by @entity0 for the @entity1 got a beauty problem ? try sticking a patch on it			1
women are increasingly resorting to cloth , plaster and jelly ‘ patches ’ which , when stuck to the face , and sometimes left overnight , are said to treat everything from lip wrinkles to frown lines			1
but apart from giving your husband nightmares , do they work ? @entity0 teamed up with skincare expert @entity15 , who runs an aesthetic clinic in @entity17 , to test them			1
@entity20 @entity19 @entity21 , £ 1.99 for two pairs , montagnejeunesse.com the claim : these clever little eye patches help reduce fine lines , sagging skin and crow ’s feet			1
chill in the fridge before use			2
@entity0 says : they felt like blobs of jelly , or those ‘ chicken fillets ’ women use in their bras			1
cooling and moisturising , so any lines due to dryness disappeared — but the effect wore off before the day was out			2
expert view : sagging skin and crow ’s feet are caused by sun damage , fat loss and repeated muscle contraction			1
any topical product will have to be able to deliver active ingredients through the skin barrier			2
but the cold mask helps to reduce swelling by temporarily shrinking the blood vessels under the eye			2
verdict : wo n’t get rid of all lines or bags , but will provide a temporary boost to eyes for an evening out			2
3/5 essence of snail skin @entity61 , £ 14.99 for five , skinpep.com the claim : one application will dramatically hydrate , smooth , soften and boost skin elasticity			1
the mask contains five clinically tested peptides , botanical extracts , antioxidants			2
and concentrated snail secretion to rejuvenate fatigued looking skin			2
@entity0 says : like all the other masks that trap moisture against the skin , this helped banish crepiness on the neck , although could n’t smooth out deeper lines			1
expert view : the neck is so often neglected			1
it needs special attention to prevent early signs of ageing , such as sagging and jowls			2
snail secretion sounds like an odd ingredient , but there is some evidence that it contains a type of protein which may help with skin rejuvenation			2
verdict : if your neck needs a bit of tender loving care , this mask will definitely give it a quick boost			2
3/5 farewell to @entity98 @entity99 , £ 18.95 for 144 patches , frownies.co.uk they say : @entity102 help change the shape of the muscle under the patch			2
by holding the muscle flat and relaxed while you sleep the body can reverse muscle memory , keeping you from frowning while you sleep			0
@entity0 says : these are like super-sticky stamps			1
you wet them , hold the skin taut , then stick them on			0
they sound basic but , after a couple of weeks , lines looked fainter			0
expert view : some studies have shown that you may frown 70 - 80 times in your sleep , which eventually contributes to permanent lines			1
if these patches stay in place , they may be of benefit			0
i like the concept ! verdict : wo n’t get rid of wrinkles entirely as you ’ll still frown during the day , but they ’re inexpensive and quite effective			1
5/5 @entity132 @entity133 , £ 46 for six pairs , timetospa.co.uk the claim : clinically proven to instantly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles			1
@entity0 says : bigger than many cheaper ones , so worked on more of the face			1
left on for 20 minutes , skin was smoother and tighter			0
results seemed to last quite well			0
expert view : some interesting ingredients			1
the houttuynia cordata leaf is used in @entity147 medicine as a detoxifying element , whereas the camellia sinensis leaf ( found in green tea ) has anti-inflammatory properties			0
hyaluronic acid will smooth the dead outer layer of skin cells , making skin feel hydrated in the short term			0
verdict : at this price , an occasional treat , but they did what they promised , hydrating , tightening and zinging up the eye area			0
3/5 @entity164 lips @entity165 , £ 46.75 for 16 , jamelaskincare.co.uk the claim : the combination of gold and plant collagen helps to increase cellular metabolism			1
the rapid absorption of the nutrients also replenishes moisture leaving the lips smoother and healthier			0
@entity0 says : this makes you look quite strange , and only really stayed on when lying flat on your back , which was a bit annoying			1
although lips were softer , they did n’t look plumper			0
expert view : the skin on the lips is thinner than the rest of the face and therefore more prone to moisture loss			1
also contains rose oil , recognised as an emollient to dry skin , and short - term benefits may be seen due to the application of hyaluronic acid on the skin surface			0
verdict : this definitely softens lips , but the gold seems a bit of a gimmick			0
i do n’t believe the mask will have an effect on the cellular metabolism , and at this price , you could buy a lot of hydrating , plumping lip balm			0
1/5 iron out smile lines @entity208 , £ 30 for eight ( four for forehead , four pairs for smile lines ) , marksandspencer.com the claim : visibly smooth smile lines — in ten minutes flat — without a needle in sight			1
these peptide - packed transdermal patches plump deep creases around the mouth			0
@entity0 says : although they definitely helped improve the surface of the skin , the deeper lines did not disappear in ten minutes			1
expert view : hydrating oils can instantly smooth skin by softening the layer of dead cells on its surface , however long - term hydration usually needs specifically formulated hyaluronic acids to penetrate deeply			1
the gels contain @entity232 cloudberry , which has high levels of vitamins a , @entity235 , important for healthy skin			0
verdict : naso - labial folds — or marionette lines — are hard to treat without filler			0
these patches improve the appearance of the skin , but to see serious results you would need to apply ingredients such as these daily			0
2/5 wipe away the years @entity246 , £ 46 for six , drlewinns.co.uk the claim : a powerful anti-ageing booster to target the early signs of ageing and tired , lack - lustre complexions			2
packed with natural extracts and advanced skin - smoothing and line - erasing technology to hydrate , plump and soothe skin			0
@entity0 says : being in two pieces makes this mask easy to use with no mess			1
results were good : skin felt hydrated and looked glowing			0
expert view : repeated facial expressions eventually cause permanent wrinkles			1
the key ingredient appears to be acetyl hexapeptide - 8 , which claims to soften some expression lines			0
an alternative to @entity268 ? not quite yet			0
verdict : this will get rid of fine lines , and as it ’s soothing and fuss - free would be ideal for rejuvenating skin the morning after a party			0
about the same price as many luxury face masks , without the mess			0
