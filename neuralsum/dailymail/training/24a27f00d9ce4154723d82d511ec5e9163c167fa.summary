by @entity0 published : 04:22 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 03:38 est , 12 december 2012 sick : @entity1 was handed the jail - term by a court on the @entity5 mainland for re-offending after his release halfway through a six - year sentence a @entity5 rapist known as the ' @entity10 ' who attacked at least seven @entity13 women in @entity14 was jailed for a record 52 years yesterday			1
@entity1 , 39 , will not be considered for parole until he is 91 , which is believed to be the longest sentence given in a @entity5 court for rape			1
three of his @entity13 victims gave evidence against the cocaine - snorting thug in a trial in @entity26 , on the @entity5 mainland			1
the brutal knifepoint attacks took place in the space of just a month - and - a - half , after he was released halfway through a six - year sentence for sex attacks on other @entity13 tourists			1
following his repeat offence in august 2010 , he appeared in a magistrates court on the holiday island and was ordered to return to a mainland prison			2
he was also charged with violating the terms of his release while on a suspended sentence for rape and robbery of @entity13 women since 1997 , when he was 25 years old			1
@entity1 would trap the women on a woodland path after partying with them on the beach and repeatedly rape them for hours			1
a holiday rep from @entity49 , @entity50 , wept as she described her ordeal in court			2
' he would talk to me politely , calmly , and then rape me , ' she said			2
' within that time he raped me a total of six times			2
' he would tell me in broken @entity57 , " come on , it is not terrible , i am not a bad man			2
if you do not resist it will be better			0
" ' he would ask , " is it good ? say yes "			0
' i feared he was going to kill me to get rid of the evidence			0
' instead , @entity1 showed her back to her hotel before taking her money and a phone , @entity64 reported			0
grave offences : @entity1 is sent back to prison to complete his previous six - year sentence for robbery and rape in 2010			1
today the 39 - year - old was told he would not be released until the age of 91 a 45 - year - old @entity13 holiday rep was also raped by @entity1 in the woods for hours			1
the woman , from @entity79 , said : ' he was forceful and very threatening , sexually totally aggressive			0
' then he would be polite and almost friendly			0
' again , @entity1 took her money and phone then let her go			0
his third victim was on her first lone holiday abroad as an 18th birthday gift from her parents			0
@entity5 police believe @entity1 attacked even more @entity13 tourists			1
@entity89 , who admitted rape , robbery and assault , begged for leniency , saying he was ' ugly ' and that ' forcing myself on them was the only way i could secure physical contact with women			1
' earlier , his brother yelled from the court corridor : ' give me a gun and i â€™ll shoot him myself			2
' @entity5 yesterday sent out a message that it was determined to protect its valued women tourists			1
chilling : @entity106 calmly told one victim not to resist , before raping her six times , she told the court when homeless @entity1 failed to turn up with a lawyer , one was appointed by the state by ballot so the trial could take place			2
all the female lawyers refused to participate in the ballot			0
according to @entity118 statistics , @entity5 has the highest number of @entity13 rape victims in the world			1
this is believed to be due to the excessive drinking of young holiday makers and the fact that the country still has vast stretches of isolated beaches			0
there was a scandal at the time , when it emerged that detectives had identified him as their prime suspect immediately after the rape on 12 july 2010 - but waited until he had raped four women before calling the @entity13 consulate to help hunt him down			1
police forced his surrender by cutting off all his access to food , to his family and to possible friends			0
disturbing : the ' @entity10 ' , who would party with tourists on a @entity148 beach before raping women on a woodland path , said he was ' ugly ' and had no choice but to force himself on women @entity1 was unemployed and lived in poverty in a ' hovel , hardly a home ' , with his parents , his brother and sister			1
he had never married and told magistrate @entity161 at the time : ' my family and i live like animals			0
' we have no real home , and i myself have been rejected by society because of my past			0
i have no work and no hope of making a proper living			0
i know that no woman will accept me			0
' so rape and robbery was the only solution left to me to satisfy my basic needs			2

attacked three women after release halfway through earlier sentence
the 39 - year - old will not get out of jail until he is 91 , in what is thought to be the longest sentence ever given in a @entity5 court for rape
he would party with tourists on the beach before raping them in woods
@entity196 said this was his ' only way of getting physical contact with women '
