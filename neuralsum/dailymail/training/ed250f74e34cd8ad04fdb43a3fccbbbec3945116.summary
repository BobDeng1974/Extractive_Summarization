@entity65 , the memorial and museum 's ceo , makes $ 378,000 a year , though his and other executives ' six - figure salaries are funded through private donations			2
still , the idea of a gift shop does n't sit well with many close to the tragedy , who believe it could have been kept closed until wednesday , when the museum opens to the public			1

the museum opened to victims ' families and survivors on thursday and will open for the *general* public on may *21*
