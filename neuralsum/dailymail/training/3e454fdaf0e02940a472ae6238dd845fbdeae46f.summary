@entity70 was arrested and is also being held in custody			0
the day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training			0
but it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed , dangeours criminals			0
the government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers , druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year			0
last july , @entity110 ( pictured above ) was convicted of murdering @entity111 in the village of @entity113 , @entity114 , while on day release			0

@entity70 , who has swastika tattoos on his arms , was jailed for seven years in 2006 for a two - month spree of ‘ professionally executed robberies ’			0
he threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on off - licences in @entity73			0
he was caught after an employee slipped an explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash			0
an urgent review is currently taking place into why @entity22 was allowed temporary day release earlier this month			1
@entity12 and @entity13 failed to return to @entity14 in @entity15 yesterday evening , and police believe they may be attempting to travel back to their home cities of @entity25 and @entity27 despite going on the run twice beforehand , the robber was allowed to walk out of @entity172 open prison in @entity24 where he was serving 13 life sentences			1
he was eventually caught in @entity175 on may 7 after spending almost four days on the run and has since been charged with robbing the @entity177 , in @entity178 , @entity179 , at gunpoint			2
last year , @entity181 chief inspector of prisons @entity182 said @entity146 had ‘ needlessly restrictive ’ security for an open prison			1
located near @entity187 , the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to @entity191 high security hospital , which houses @entity194 murderer @entity192			2
justice secretary @entity195 said : ' keeping the public safe is our priority and i will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders undermine public confidence in the prison system ' @entity205 have reached record lows under this government but i take each and every incident seriously			1
i have already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency			2
' with immediate effect , prisoners will no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously absconded , and there will also be no unrestricted " town leave "			2
' i am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public safety			2

@entity12 and @entity13 absconded from @entity14 open prison
police have urged public not to approach the pair , who escaped yesterday
