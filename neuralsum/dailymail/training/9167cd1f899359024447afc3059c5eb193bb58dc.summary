she might have two lovely daughters of her own but that does n't mean @entity6 's @entity5 @entity4 is immune to the charms of other people 's children			1
the @entity6 queen looked thrilled as an adorable little girl approached her with a posy of flowers as she arrived in @entity14 for a state visit this morning			1
with her was @entity16 , who looked equally smitten as he crouched down beside his wife to say hello to the child , who was warmly wrapped up against the november chill in a duck down coat and a pair of eye - catching striped tights			1
ever elegant , @entity4 looked glamorous in a chic cream coat dress enlivened with a floral pattern created using the traditional @entity6 blackwork embroidery technique			2
rather more modern was her softly - waved hairstyle and the stylish grey and cream clutch she carried for her arrival at the @entity43 in the centre of @entity14			0
once there , and in front of an excited crowd of well - wishers , she and @entity16 were greeted by a dapper @entity29 , 59 , and his wife , who wore an elegant dip - dyed silk coat			0
also in the welcoming party was @entity29 's heir , crown prince @entity53 , 33 , and his @entity55 wife , @entity54 , 30 , who comes from a family descended from the @entity58 royal house of @entity59 , which , among others , produced several mediaeval @entity62 @entity61			1

full independence under the @entity31 came just under 20 years later , when the @entity76 enshrined @entity14 's existence in international law and ended years of rule by the @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity83			2
although part of @entity14 was later incorporated into what would , in 1839 , become @entity55 , the country remained intact through the @entity87 of 1870 and the @entity88 and @entity89			0
indeed , @entity14 's monarchy has enjoyed a considerably smoother run over the last century than @entity6 's own , which was abolished during the dictatorship of @entity92 and only reinstated under @entity93 in the mid 1970s			0
@entity93 , who stood down earlier this year , became the fourth monarch to abdicate in less than two years , following pope @entity95 , queen @entity96 , and @entity97			0
the latter 's heir , now @entity98 of the @entity55 , 54 , is first cousin to @entity29 and a regular visitor to @entity14			0
