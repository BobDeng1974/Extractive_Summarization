by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 3 november 2013 updated : 07:26 est , 4 november 2013 veteran politician : former barrister @entity3 's comments are likely to reignite the row over the veil @entity7 women should not wear the full - face veil in court because it is difficult to give evidence from inside ‘ a kind of bag , ’ @entity3 said yesterday			1
the minister , a former barrister , believes women should wear what they want in public – but said the same rules could not apply if they were engaged in a ‘ serious issue such as giving evidence ’ as the veil could ‘ undermine ’ a trial			1
today he received the backing of the prime minister , who said institutions should be able to ' set and enforce ' rules on dress			0
mr @entity3 described the niqab , where only the woman ’s eyes are visible , as a ‘ most peculiar costume for the 21st century ’ that left them ‘ completely invisible ’ to others			1
mr @entity3 ’s comments are likely to reignite the row over the veil , which was highlighted when a judge asked a @entity7 woman to remove her veil to give evidence in a trial scheduled to begin this month			1
at a plea hearing back in september , judge @entity46 ruled that the 22 - year - old woman – accused of intimidating a witness – would have to be seen by him , the jury and the lawyers if she was to give evidence			1
the woman will be allowed to keep her face covered for the rest of the proceedings			0
but the judge said it was ‘ crucial ’ that the jury could see the defendant ‘ for the purposes of evaluating ’ her statement			0
veteran politician mr @entity3 , currently minister without portfolio , said : ‘ i do think it ’s a most peculiar costume for people to adopt in the 21st century			1
‘ but that ’s not for me to decide when they ’re not actually engaged in some serious issue such as giving evidence			1
that ’s the bit which i think is almost impossible to have a proper trial if one of the persons is in a kind of bag			0
’ he added : ‘ i was a barrister at the bar in criminal cases for about 15 years , and i do n’t think a witness should be allowed to give evidence from behind a veil			1
the key thing a judge or a jury has to do is decide if someone is telling the truth			0
‘ the fact is we do n’t know individually how each of us decides whether we trust somebody or believe they ’re telling the truth when they tell us a story			0
it ’s all because of body language and expression and how they do it , ' he told @entity95 's @entity96			0
‘ i ca n’t see how on earth a judge and a jury can really appraise the evidence when you ’re facing somebody who ’s cloaked , and is completely invisible to you			2
’ opinion : mr @entity3 described the wearing of the niqab ( left ) , where only the woman 's eyes are visible , as a ' most peculiar costume for the 21 century ' that left them ' completely invisible ' to others and while he maintained that people should be able to wear ‘ what the devil they like in public , ’ he went on to say : ‘ but giving evidence in a court of law on a serious issue of guilt or innocence , i think the jury and the judge have got to be able to see the face of the witness , judge their demeanour , and decide for themselves whether they ’re going to rely on this evidence			1
‘ maybe there ’ll have to be some sort of screening from the general public but i actually think it undermines a trial , and that ’s not based on any trace of @entity138 on my part , i do n’t have that at all			2
’ @entity140 said @entity141 agreed with mr @entity3			0
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' there is an important issue around dress codes and uniform policies in a number of institutions and it is very important that those institutions should be able to set and enforce them			2
' for example , schools that have uniform policies			0
there may be cases at borders where it may be important to ascertain someone 's identity ' some people in @entity163 have called for the niqab to be banned in public as it is in @entity166			2
there has also been heated debate over whether children should be compelled to wear it in school , where uniform policy is the responsibility of the head teacher			0
@entity175 , from the @entity176 , told the @entity95 ’s @entity177 he did not believe adopting the full - face veil was a ‘ requirement ’ of @entity180 – explaining that only a small minority of @entity7 women choose to wear them			1
and @entity163 ’s most senior @entity7 politician , communities minister @entity183 , said last week that a ban was ‘ not the @entity163 way ’ and called for a ‘ common sense ’ approach to the problem .			2
