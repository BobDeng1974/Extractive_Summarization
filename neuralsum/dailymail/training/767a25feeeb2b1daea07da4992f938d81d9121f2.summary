a family who moved to a picturesque cottage halfway up a @entity3 mountain is receiving a steady stream of visitors - namely @entity6 fans			1
ecologist @entity8 , 42 , thought the tiny house would be an escape from the hustle and bustle of city life			1
but because @entity6 used it as a country hideaway to write @entity18 , @entity8 's family get visited frequently by rock fans on a pilgrimage			1
the house is where @entity6 wrote their classic anthem @entity18 the family are now often visited by rockers taking a pilgrimage to the property one mystery rocker even stole the sign from outside the remote property where @entity38 and @entity39 lived			2
father - of - three @entity8 said : ' they come from all over the world			2
' one guy walked all the way here from @entity44 , foraging berries and sleeping in churchyards as he went			1
' one rambler walked all the way there from @entity44 , eating berries and sleeping in churchyards as he went @entity18 was written by @entity6 frontman @entity38 ( centre ) and guitarist @entity39 ( right ) and formed the centrepiece of their untitled fourth album , referred to as @entity57 @entity58 wrote the song from a selection of tapes they recorded while staying at the cottage in 1970 @entity8 lives with wife @entity22 and their daughter at @entity24 , near @entity65 , @entity66			1
he told us : ' we love our home and are very lucky to live here			0
' the property was bought by @entity22 's father in 1970 shortly after the rockers moved out			1
@entity6 wrote much of their third album at the house and it is immortalised in the song ' @entity76 ' - although the band accidently misspelled its name			2
one mystery @entity6 fan even managed to sneak up and take the sign from outside their house genius : since its release in 1971 it has consistently ranked among the best rock songs of all time in polls while staying at @entity24 in 1970 , @entity39 and @entity38 recorded parts of @entity18 on a cassette player after the intro came to @entity39 in the middle of the night			2
they then took parts of the recording back to their fellow band mates who added the bassline and drumbeats			0
the track was released as part of the band 's fourth untitled album , usually referred to as @entity57 , and while it was the stand - out track , it took two or three years for it to reach anthemic status			0
since then it has consistently ranked among the greatest rock song of all time in magazine polls , and in the @entity113 alone it is estimated it had been played 2,874,000 times on radio , enough to last for 44 years if run back - to - back			0
it is perhaps not surprising then that @entity39 once called an @entity119 radio station during a charity drive and offered to donate $ 10,000 if they promised never to play the track again , which the station agreed to			0
in 1982 the song fell foul of the backward masking ' scandal ' that affected many great rock songs of the time , as @entity113 tv stations alleged the song contained hidden satanic messages that could only be heard if it was played backwards			0
among the messages said to be hidden in @entity18 were ' here 's to my sweet @entity132 ' and ' i sing because i live with @entity132 ' , which could allegedly be heard if the lyrics ' if there 's a bustle in your hedgerow , do n't be alarmed now ... ' were reversed .			0

@entity8 and @entity22 family moved to @entity24 cottage to escape city life
the house was bought in 1970s by @entity22 's father and passed to them
they get rock fans visiting from all over the world
