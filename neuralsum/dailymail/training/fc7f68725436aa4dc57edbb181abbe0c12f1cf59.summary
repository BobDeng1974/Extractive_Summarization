an expat benefit cheat who swindled £ 60,000 from @entity3 taxpayers has been ordered to repay just £ 1 - because his house is in @entity6 is in his wife 's name			2
@entity9 was branded a ' financial parasite ' by a judge after claiming to be a penniless pensioner in @entity3 when in fact he was married and living abroad			1
he claimed pension credit and disability living allowance for eight years by lying about where he lived and his marital status			1
@entity9 had said he was living on his own in @entity20 , @entity21 , when he was actually living in @entity22 and @entity23			2
@entity9 claimed to be a single penniless pensioner living in @entity20 , when he was actually married and living in @entity22 , pictured , and @entity23 in @entity6 the false addresses were actually owned by his wife 's daughter			1
the 73 - year - old was jailed for six months last year but returned to @entity29 for a @entity31 hearing			1
there , he was told he must pay just £ 1 after his publicly - funded barrister told the judge he had no recoverable assets and the £ 80,000 villa where he lives in @entity6 is in his wife 's name			1
the court heard @entity9 married @entity40 in 2005			1
within months , the couple had sold her house in @entity20 , making a £ 191,000 profit , which they used to start a new life in @entity6			0
recorder mr @entity46 told the court @entity9 had benefited by £ 60,353.58 from crime - but there were no available assets to seize			1
he added the @entity51 will be able to pursue @entity9 for the money if he ever returns to @entity3 and has assets of his own			1
he said : ' if @entity9 were to return to this country to take advantage of our wonderful @entity57 , the prosecution could have another go in the future			2
' this is not an attractive position for the court to adopt and frankly one has the feeling the @entity65 have done rather well in the way they have managed things			0
' the court is presented with a dilemma			0
in plain terms , @entity9 has ended up with no assets and his wife with a property in @entity23			2
' it leaves the court a most unsatisfactory position			0
@entity9 has enjoyed the benefit of accommodation for a considerable period of time			0
' it is accepted by the @entity51 there is no prospect of a finding being made against him which can be enforced			0
' i have taken some time to explain this order because sometimes these things are controversial and difficult for the public to accept			0
i have expressed my own concern that the court has been left in this position			0
' the @entity93 explained that @entity6 property laws are different from those in @entity3 , meaning that as a husband @entity9 has no stake in the house in @entity23 because it is solely in his wife 's name			1
he said even if the couple were to split up and return to @entity3 he would have very little claim on the proceeds of the sale of the @entity20 house in 2006 because it had been his wife 's property and was sold shortly after they married			2
the 73 - year - old was jailed for six months last year but returned to @entity29			0
pictured , for a @entity31 hearing @entity110 , prosecuting , said it is accepted the only tangible assets now remaining are the house in @entity23 , which is in the sole name of mrs @entity114			1
he said the amount which @entity9 obtained by benefit fraud was £ 48,000 but the figure had been increased to £ 60,000 through the addition of interest			0
@entity120 , defending , said the couple had lost money on their first home in @entity6 and then moved to their current address , where the current valuation is also less than the 105,000 euros ( £ 82,000 ) mrs @entity114 paid in 2010			0
she said @entity9 has no realizable assets in his own name and said the only option open to the court was a nominal order to pay £ 1			2
at his original hearing judge @entity133 , @entity134 , told @entity9 : ' you were a financial parasite who lied repeatedly			1
' the public view dishonesty of this sort at a time of financial austerity as behaviour which demands and calls for significant punishment			0

claimed to be penniless in @entity3 when he was married and living abroad
received pension credit and disability living allowance for eight years
