by @entity0 when a couple in @entity3 came to buy a @entity4 named @entity5 for $ 85 from an animal shelter , staff happily handed the dog over , and took a picture to mark the occasion			1
but less than an hour later a very similar picture appeared on @entity11 which seemed to show the same dog up for sale - but this time for $ 200			1
the post even claimed @entity5 was half her age , advertising her as a five - year - old dog instead of her actual age of ten			1
@entity4 @entity5 was adopted from shelter on @entity3 by couple who paid $ 85 - only to reappear in a @entity11 advert an hour later on sale for $ 200 followers of the @entity24 shelter on @entity25 spotted the similarities between the dogs after the woman holding @entity29 appeared wearing the same t - shirt			1
the ad claimed : ' my boyfriend and i is [ sic ] too caught up with work since we have 2 jobs each and she needs a family that 'll give her attention			0
' furious website users demanded that the new owner return @entity5 to the shelter , prompting workers from the animal home to contact the couple			1
while local news reports suggested that the woman initially refused to return the animal , the @entity24 have now confirmed @entity5 was given back to them			2
@entity50 , a spokesman for the shelter , said : ' great news			0
@entity5 was returned to us when the adopters recognized they could not care for her			2
' she was adopted to a loving family this afternoon			0
we applaud them for returning her to us			0
they did the right thing and that 's all that matters			0
' the ad listed @entity29 as five - years - old , which she is in fact ten			1
the shelter said they contacted @entity29 's owners who have now returned the animal after ' realizing they were unable to care for her ' but social media users have have called the shelter 's adoption process into question			2
@entity74 wrote on the group 's @entity25 page saying : ' i wonder how they know these people are a loving family ? just wondering			0
' @entity81 added : ' the public outcry helped to prevent @entity5 from being flipped on @entity83 and more importantly made @entity24 realize that they need to update / revamp their adoption policy			0
