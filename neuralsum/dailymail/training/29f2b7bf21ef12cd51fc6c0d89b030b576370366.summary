by @entity0 researchers claim one of the world 's largest networks of underground rivers could be hidden under the sea bed off the coast of @entity8			1
it is thought the freshwater channels could be up to 30 miles long and measure up to 70ft wide in places			1
the discovery was made by researchers in @entity14 on the west coast , one of @entity8 's most treasured beauty spots			2
breakthrough : scientists believe a network of underground ' rivers ' up to 30 miles long are flowing under @entity14 , creating a well on @entity23 ( pictured ) which provides limitless fresh water the ' rivers ' are formed by water seeping through porous limestone and slowly carving out channels over hundreds of years			1
smaller channels are common in @entity8 , where much of the country is made of limestone rock			2
it is so permeable that it allows the existence of ' disappearing ' lakes unique to @entity8 called turloughs , where vast bodies of water can vanish underground within a short space of time through cracks in the rock			2
in @entity14 , the researchers said , the water was likely to be flowing for several miles before emerging as ' springs ' out of the sea bed and straight into the @entity45			1
they discovered it because locals on @entity49 , one of the @entity50 , spoke of a well of fresh water which never ran out , the @entity46 reported			0
@entity53 : the location of @entity49 island in relation to the rest of @entity8 and @entity14 breakthrough : one of the researchers at the university of @entity8 described the find as a ' submarine river ' the researchers from the @entity60 analysed the well and discovered it was supplying more water than all the rain falling on the island			1
that meant the source of the water must have been on the mainland , they said			0
dr @entity73 , a lecturer at the @entity60 in @entity14 , told the @entity46 : ' the islands generally have water problems , they are always short , but this well went deep into the rock and was getting more water than falls on the whole island			1
' we found it had tapped into a submarine river flowing from the land some miles away			0
' @entity8 is already famous for its limestone caves , one of the most well - known of which is @entity88 near the south eastern city of @entity90			0
@entity91 described it as one of the darkest places in @entity8 and inside it is still murky and wet , filled with stalactites and stalagmites formed over millions of years			0
it contains almost a quarter of a mile of passages , stretching 150ft below ground , and in ad 928 it was the site of the brutal @entity101 massacre .			0

*waterways* could be up to 70ft wide under the sea bed in @entity14
they were *investigated* by researchers at @entity60
huge *systems* form when water permeates through soft limestone
