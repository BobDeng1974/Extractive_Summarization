@entity0 sat next to club manager @entity1 and produced a performance as assured as he has been on the pitch this season			1
mother @entity5 featured heavily , and there were surely a few winces coming from @entity9 officials when @entity0 suggested he might have to leave the club in search of @entity13 football			1
the player was quick to put what could have been an incendiary revelation into context			2
@entity0 has excelled for @entity9 this season , scoring eight goals in 13 appearances so far 2012 - 13 : no goals in one appearance 2013 - 14 : nine goals in 35 appearances 2014 - 15 : eight goals in 13 appearances ‘ it does n’t mean i am going to leave this year or next year , it ’s just an ambition i have , ’ declared a confident @entity0			1
‘ i shall take each game but my ambition is to play @entity13 , to play senior football for @entity31 , to play in big tournaments , @entity27			1
i have a big vision and hope to reach my goals			1
‘ leaving @entity9 ? if that ’s what it comes to , it will have to be that			1
’ @entity0 realises he is the hottest property in the @entity38 at the moment but a contract through to 2017 suggests he is not going anywhere just yet			1
manager @entity1 chipped in : ‘ i hope he is not going anywhere because we want to take the club forward			1
if there is an opportunity to go then it must be the right time			2
berahino scores against @entity50 at @entity51 in their @entity38 clash the 21 - year - old scored his side 's second goal against @entity57 's men as they drew 2 - 2 ‘ who knows what the future brings			1
right now he is in a good place , being given a chance to play week in and week out with a club which plays to his strengths			2
it is important that young players do n’t go to the wrong place			2
’ @entity0 was fast asleep when the squad was announced at midday on thursday			1
his mother saw the news on tv downstairs and called her son from his slumbers			2
the eight - goal striker fled war - torn @entity76 as a kid and admits he still thinks he is in dreamland			2
last season @entity0 was involved in several high - profile incidents , including taking hippy crack , and while he has turned over a new leaf , he has no intention of changing his personality			1
he added : ‘ people that know me know what type of person i am			2
i work hard in my game			2
i like to have a laugh like any other youngster			0
‘ people might look at me that way because of my loudness but i do n’t mean any harm , i just want to have fun			0
i do n’t have to change			0
there will be more eyes on me but i know i can handle the pressure and i let the football do the talking			0
@entity0 believes the things he has been through in his life have made him stronger than many others ‘ there is a lot of pressure			1
some of us thrive some of us fade away			0
mentally i could n’t be any more prepared			0
what i have been through has made me a stronger person and stronger character			0
‘ i was in the newspapers for a lot of things but always thought i would come through			0
i was learning about life and i was new in the @entity38			0
‘ i have realised i ca n’t live in a certain way as a footballer			0
i did n’t want my mum seeing me in the paper for the wrong things			0
she did n’t stop talking to me , gave me a headache sometimes and she has always been there			0
’ ‘ @entity124 said do n’t waste @entity126 ’s time , she always mentions that			0
’ if @entity0 does win his first cap , the shirt will go straight to his mother			1
first he has to play for @entity9 against @entity130 on sunday			1
he is no longer the cocky upstart who clashed with senior players last season and revealed that every player shook his hand when he reported for training on friday morning			1
although @entity0 was born in @entity76 he has represented @entity31 at every youth level from the @entity139 up @entity0 has a remarkable record for the @entity31 under 21 side , scoring 10 goals in 13 appearances the forward credits @entity144 for his change of attitude and the manager is obviously fond of him			1
he added : ‘ it is important he remains focused , important he does n’t forget			0
it is very easy to be distracted by what happens outside a training ground or football pitch			0
‘ my feeling is that this is a great opportunity for @entity0 to go and learn			1
that ’ s what top players do to reach this level			0
i will ask him what have you learnt ? this is the best learning experience he can have			0
‘ i have said here on a number of occasions as long as he keeps doing what he ’s been doing , living his life , keeps applying himself then good things will happen			0
