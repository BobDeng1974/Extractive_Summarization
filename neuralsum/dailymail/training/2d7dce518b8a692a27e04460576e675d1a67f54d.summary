by @entity0 last updated at 3:39 pm on 22nd november 2011 a bride who was left paralysed by a rare nerve condition made a miraculous recovery after she became determined to walk down the aisle unassisted			1
@entity5 , 29 , was diagnosed with @entity7 syndrome and told by doctors she might be confined to a wheelchair for life			1
her family watched on as she was left frozen in her own body , unable to move , swallow , or even breathe unassisted as the illness - which affects only one in 50,000 people in the @entity17 - took hold			1
@entity5 , left paralysed by a rare nerve condition amde a full recovery and walked down the aisle to meet her husband - to - be @entity22 despite only having been with her boyfriend , @entity22 , 27 , a professional rugby player , for a month when she was first taken ill , he stuck by her , providing her with round the clock care			2
it was when he proposed that @entity5 , who works as a hospital assistant , was determined to regain the ability in her legs			2
she said : ' being stuck in a chair for the rest of my life was n't an option for me			2
' when @entity22 later proposed , i was determined to walk down the aisle without a zimmer frame			2
' @entity5 , pictured here in a wheelchair , was warned by doctors that she might never walk again guillain - barre syndrome simulates a nerve cell , causing the body to attack its own nervous system as it fights the infection and can cause paralysis and even death			0
within 48 hours of noticing the first symptoms , which include a numbing sensation in the arms and legs , @entity5 was admitted to @entity52 , @entity53 , and was immediately transferred to intensive care			0
@entity5 said : ' i was locked in my body - i could n't move , could n't communicate - and the pain was so bad			1
@entity7 ( pronounced @entity58 ) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the peripheral nervous system named after two of three @entity62 doctors who first described the condition in 1916 , @entity64 and @entity66 - @entity65 leads to a tingly , numbing sensation in the arms and legs can eventually result in a short - term loss of feeling and movement ( temporary paralysis ) exact cause is unclear			1
and there no way of identifying who is most at risk			0
affects about 1,500 people in the @entity17 every year most people ( about 8 out of 10 ) make a full recovery within a few weeks or months , and do not have any further problems ' i thought i was going to die and not be able to tell my family how much i loved them			1
' after eight weeks of battling the condition , @entity5 made a miraculous recovery and was allowed to go home , with the warning she may never come out of her wheelchair			0
but after months of physiotherapy , @entity92 eventually managed to take her first steps , with the help of a walking stick and eventually was able to walk unaided			0
as the couple , from @entity99 , @entity100 , struggled to save for the wedding because of the time they had taken off work - they applied to go on @entity105 - the reality show where the groom plans the wedding in three weeks - without any input from the bride , but is given £ 12,000 to blow on the big day			0
@entity5 added : ' my wedding day was perfect - it was so emotional walking down the aisle , when two years earlier , i did n't know if i 'd ever walk again			0
' @entity22 has been my rock and i feel like the luckiest woman in the world to have him and my health			1
' a spokesperson from the @entity7 support group said : ' @entity7 syndrome is a rare condition , only one in 50,000 people in the @entity17 will suffer from it , and many of those will experience nothing more than pins and needles in their fingers and toes			1
' however , in some cases , the syndrome does develop further , and in 25 per cent of cases , patients will be hospitalised and put on a ventilator			0
