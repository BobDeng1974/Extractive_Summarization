by @entity0 this @entity1 might be smarter than the average bear , but he sure does n't eat healthier			1
a couple in @entity4 , @entity5 , captured video of a black bear raiding their freezer for a pie - after tossing out several packages of vegetables first			1
@entity13 , the owner of @entity14 in @entity15 , told @entity16 that she had noticed food was going missing from her outdoor fridge and freezer for weeks			1
on this day , he apparently had a sweet tooth however , she was confused , because there was usually no mess			0
she would just find the door open an items missing			0
she set up a camera and caught the culprit , erm , red - pawed			0
' you could tell he had been in there before and the first time he opened the lid probably whacked him on the head , ' ms @entity13 told @entity16			1
' this time , he pushes it open and looks to make sure it does n't hit him			1
' mrs @entity13 says the bear has been hanging around the camp for years			2
he never bothers any of the people or animals - he just breaks into the trash sometimes			0
after finding his pie , this beast proves he 's smarter than the average bear by making a hasty retreat his freezer raids are a relatively recent caper , though none of his antics are too bothersome , mrs @entity13 says			2
' we 've seen him out in the pasture with the horses , rolling around in the grass - the horses do n't even care about him , ' she said			0
' he 's very timid when it comes to humans , he always runs away			0

the black bear has been a *fixture* at @entity14 in @entity4 , @entity5 , for years
he carefully opened the door - even making sure it did n't swing back and hit him in the head
