so far the team behind it have developed apps compatible with both @entity47 and @entity49 devices with a range of features to help users track down their stickered - up possessions when they go missing			1
the first function the app offers is a simple radar screen that approximates the distance - but not yet the location - of all the paired @entity26 - find stickers in range			1
unfortunately the technology does not yet allow the app to determine which direction the lost items are in , so users have to start walking while watching the screen to see whether the device they are hunting for gets closer			2

this feature could be used to keep track of your children at the playground , for example , or to remind you if you 're getting ready to leave the house for work and forget to pick up your keys			0
the feature can even be reversed to help you to remember your phone by , for example , getting the sticker on your keys to buzz should you carry them too far from the gadget			0
a third feature called find it helps to locate any items that are out of range by setting an alarm to sound as soon as they appear on the app 's radar , allowing you to begin using it to track down the lost item as soon as you are nearby			2
the stickers themselves will keep going for up to a year on a watch - type battery			1

he said : ' just like everyone we lose stuff all the time so , we thought , why not design an ultra-small @entity126 connected sticker you can stick on any device , person or animal so you can easily find them ? ' so we came up with @entity133			0
@entity134 is an ultra-small sticker with built in bluetooth low energy with a range of 100ft , about the size of a @entity13 quarter and with a battery life that lasts about a year			1
' @entity141 can be paged producing both sound and light , helping you find things easily , even in the dark			0
