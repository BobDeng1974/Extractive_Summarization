' it only hit me when the doctors told me the mole was cancerous and it had be removed			2
' i was completely shocked , but relieved that they had removed it			2
' i have never been on a sunbed in my life - not even to build up a base tan before going on holiday			2
' as part of my job and coaching i ’m outside a lot but , because i ’m naturally fairly skinned , i ’ve always worn sunscreen			0
' the skin cancer was first discovered after a weird mole on @entity51 ’ calf changed colour and became scabby			1
on visiting the doctor , a biopsy confirmed the growth was cancerous which meant the mole was removed along with a surrounding 2cm of skin			2
following the operation , the teacher from @entity60 in the @entity61 , lived cancer free for almost five years			0
as the cancer spread mrs @entity8 had to have a lumpectomy , a third of her left lungs and her lymph glands removed in that time she met her future husband , @entity70			1
over @entity72 in 2011 - one week before her final ct scan to check whether she was in remission - mrs @entity51 found a lump in her groin			1
after a biopsy showed the melanoma had returned and spread to her lymph nodes , both were removed in february 2012 and a drain was fitted in her leg to remove lymph fluid			1
mrs @entity8 said : ' the second time round i kept scaring myself looking things up on the internet and making myself quite upset			2
' having the drain attached was horrible - i was permanently carrying this bag round me which was collection the fluid			0
' i refused to let it get me down though , so when me and the girls went out for my 30th birthday i bought an over the shoulder bag to cover it up			0
' despite her cancer and the treatment she was undergoing mrs @entity8 continued to coach and play netball			1
after the drain was removed , she said she felt her freedom return			0
she was positive , hearing from surgeons that the area was now clear from cancer			0

on christmas day 2012 - three years after getting together - 32 - year - old mr @entity113 proposed and the couple started planning their wedding for august 2013			1

six weeks before her big day , mrs @entity8 had a third of her left lung removed and a lumpectomy on her right breast , throwing the wedding into jeopardy			1
melanoma is a rare cancer that begins in the skin and can spread to other organs in the body			2
the most common sign of the disease is a new mole or a change in an existing mole			0
this can happen anywhere on the body , but is most often found on the back , legs , arms and face			0
in most cases , melanomas have an irregular shape and are more than one colour			0
they also tend to be larger than normal moles and can be itchy or bleed			0
melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally			0
it is not known what causes the cancer , but it is thought exposure to uv light from natural or artifical souces may be partly responsible			0
there are around 13,000 new cases diagnosed in the @entity164 every year			2
melanoma is one of the most common cancers in people aged 15 to 34 and is also responsible for most skin cancer deaths			1
more than 2,000 people a year die in the @entity164 as a result of melanoma			0
source : @entity173 she said : ' after the operation i did n’t know whether i would be able to walk down the aisle , but the thought of marrying the love of my life really pulled me through			0
' when me and @entity70 got together i did n’t class myself as a cancer patient as the mole had been gone for two years			0
' when it returned though , @entity70 was a rock for me - along with my family - and i just wanted to marry him and celebrate our relationship no matter what			2
' despite tying the knot in august 2013 , their dream honeymoon had to be postponed as @entity8 could not fly for at least eight weeks post-surgery			1
finally , on christmas day the pair jetted off to @entity195 to celebrate their nuptials in style			0
there mrs @entity8 developed a pain in her side , and in spite of initially passing it off as a urine infection she felt a nagging that it was something more serious			2
but two days after returning home , doctors confirmed the melanoma had spread to her liver and urethra			0
she said : ' i do n’t like complaining but it just feels like me and @entity70 ca n’t enjoy anything together			0
' i ’m now on @entity215 and @entity216 to try and cure me , but if they do n’t work there ’s currently only one last set of drugs we can try			0
' i ’m well aware i ’m a bit of a ticking time bomb , but i just want to live a normal life , do a bit of travelling and keep playing netball			0
' the teacher is working to raise awareness of skin cancer , starting a fund , to which £ 2,500 has already been donated , for the @entity233 's @entity232			1
