a pensioner was forced to spend £ 600 clearing his name after a tram fare dodger 50 years his junior fraudulently used his name and address on three separate occasions			1
@entity7 , 76 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , endured months of stress and had to fork out for a solicitor after being falsely accused of dodging a fare on the @entity9 tram network			1
it later emerged that an imposter - believed to be known to mr @entity7 - had been stopped three times in august last year , but had falsely given a name and address connected to mr @entity7			1
@entity7 , 76 ( pictured ) from @entity8 , @entity9 , endured months of stress and had to fork out for a solicitor after being falsely accused of dodging fares on the @entity9 tram network he said : ‘ all this stress has come on top of a recent hospital operation i have had and i really have n’t needed this on top of it all			1
‘ i intend to try to get some money back from @entity30 or @entity31 for my inconvenience			0
' on all the occasions , the culprit had given @entity7 's full name , alongside his daughter 's address			0
he twice gave his date of birth as 1978 and once as 1988 , despite the fact mr @entity7 was born in 1939			2
afterwards , a fine notice was sent to mr @entity7 , who proved that he did not live at the given address and that he was not travelling on the tram at the time			1
@entity45 ( @entity45 ) , which is responsible for @entity30 , subsequently dropped two of the fines			0
but mr @entity7 was shocked when he received a letter at his daughter 's address , summoning him to @entity50 over the third incident			2
when he contacted police to reiterate he was not the culprit , he was advised to write a letter to the court and @entity30 operator @entity56 to explain			2
he expected the third fine to also be dropped			0
but the court case still went ahead and mr @entity7 was given a £ 310 fine in his absence			1
he said : ' surely , the best thing for @entity30 to do , given that there were two other instances where my name had been falsely given , is to contact me to check before dragging me through the courts in a battle that has cost me close to £ 600			0
the fare dodger was stopped on three separate occasions while travelling on the @entity9 tram network ( pictured ) and each time gave mr @entity7 's name ‘ when i have already made it clear that i do not live in this property , why is it my responsibility to prove i ’m innocent once again ? ’ after that , mr @entity7 hired a solicitor who arranged for him to go to @entity78 to appeal the conviction			1
but , during the hearing , mr @entity7 said he was not given a chance to explain what had happened			2
instead , another hearing was arranged in which a trial date was due to be set			0
he said : ‘ i had been told i had to go to @entity78 where i had to wait for a full day before i was told to make a statutory declaration			0
‘ i wanted to explain why i was n’t guilty			0
but they did n’t give me the chance			0
’ mr @entity7 decided not to go along to the next hearing , on the advice of his solicitor			2
it was only when he phoned the court afterwards , to find out which date had been set for his trial , that he was informed the case had been dropped			0
a spokesman for @entity45 said the company had not been made aware of the fare - dodging allegation , connected to the third incident , until it had already gone to court			0
but mr @entity7 claims he informed the operator about all three incidents from the outset			2
he is also furious that the previous incidents of fraud were not taken into account			0
@entity45 has not confirmed whether or not it has pursued the case in order to track down the true identity of the fare dodger			1
a @entity45 spokesman said : ‘ two cases were withdrawn as soon as mr @entity7 contacted @entity30 ’s operator @entity56 and provided evidence			1
‘ however , in the third case , when a different date of birth was given by a fare dodger , no contact was made with @entity56 until after it had been to court when mr @entity7 made a statutory declaration			1
‘ had mr @entity7 contacted @entity56 in good time , this case would also have been withdrawn immediately			1
the onus is on mr @entity7 to come to us			2
’ they later added : ‘ in light of the repeated difficulties mr @entity7 has faced with fare dodgers using his details , @entity56 has agreed to contact him directly if his details are given in the future			1
’ but mr @entity7 added : ‘ @entity30 has n’t been in touch to apologise for all the inconvenience that i have suffered			0

it emerged a fare dodger had falsely used his details on network in august
operators dropped two fines but he was summoned to court over the third
he contacted police and operator but was still fined £ 310 in his absence
