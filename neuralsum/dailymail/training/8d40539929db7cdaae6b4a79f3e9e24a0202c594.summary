@entity7 , 39 , has told investigators that @entity9 visited her apartment for romantic trysts in 2008 and confessed to her that his two - year - old grand - daughter @entity1 had died as a result of ' an accident that snowballed out of control '			1
mr @entity9 denied the allegations as ' very funny ' during sworn testimony in court in @entity18 , @entity19 - where his daughter is on trial for @entity1 ’s 2008 murder - telling jurors that ms @entity7 was a woman with a ' questionable past ' who he befriended out of compassion after she told him that she had a brain tumour			1
@entity29 : @entity1 's father @entity9 testified at his daughter 's murder trial at the @entity33 in @entity18 , @entity19 today - denying any romantic involvement with @entity7 bombshell : @entity7 ( left ) told investigators @entity9 ( right ) visited her apartment for romantic trysts in 2008 while she was helping to search for his grand - daughter the two first met in october 2008 when ms @entity7 , who also goes by the name of @entity39 , came to a command centre set up by mr @entity9 and his wife @entity41 in collaboration with @entity43 , an organisation that coordinates hunts for missing people			1
mr @entity9 said that he ' sometimes maybe considered her a friend or someone who was going to be helping find our grand - daughter ' and that he visited her at her home two or three times , with his wife ’s knowledge			2
' the very first time , i was in there because we had a conversation in which she relayed to me probably weeks or just a few days prior … that she has a brain tumour , she was dying , she needed someone to comfort her			2
' being ' a good guy ' , he had offered her his support , he said			2
he also said he never told @entity7 that he grabbed @entity64 by the throat , threw her against a wall and demanded @entity64 tell him where @entity1 was			1
on trial : @entity1 and her attorney @entity68 listen during testimony today			1
@entity9 is standing trial on first - degree muder , accused by prosecutors of killing her two - year - old daughter in 2008 ' i felt that she was so giving of herself , to me and my family , to help look for our grand - daughter , it was the least i could do to go in and show some compassion and respect , ' he testified			2
' to say that i had said something to her … that something might have " snowballed out of control " , that was never there , ' he insisted , admitting that he may have sent ms @entity7 text messages saying that he needed her in his life , but adding that many volunteers became like family			2
' i sent text messages to many , many volunteers … and yes , i did need those people in my life , ' he said			0
' i have nothing to hide			0
' speaking calmly but firmly , he denied suggestions by defence lawyer @entity97 that he had been ' intimate ' with the volunteer			0
on the stand : @entity1 's mother @entity41 mrs @entity100 denied in court today that she had dispatched the private investigators to search the wooded area where her grand - daughter 's body was found testimony : @entity64 's brother @entity107 said he argued with his mother after @entity1 's disappearance about sending investigators into the woods ' i never had a romantic affair with @entity7 , @entity39 or whatever names she ever wanted to give you or the world			1
if i ’m not mistaken , sir , she has a questionable past , ok ? she also had been arrested for fraud , breaking and entering , and things like that			0
she ’s not a good person , sir , ' he said			0
@entity1 ’s remains were found in swampy woodland near the @entity127 ’s home in december 2008			1
five months previously , her grandmother had reported her missing after growing suspicious about the little girl ’s month - long absence and @entity9 ’s repeated claims that the child was simply away staying with a nanny			0
after being challenged about her story by her mother and sheriff ’s deputies , @entity9 changed her story , claiming that @entity1 had been kidnapped by the nanny			1
revealed : defence attorney @entity97 ( left ) hands paperwork to @entity142 , who said he called police in august , 2008 after he saw a possible human skull near the @entity9 home volunteer : @entity147 , a worker with @entity43 , testified in the @entity1 murder trial today as @entity64 's father denied having an affair with his colleague when her trial opened five weeks ago , her lawyer admitted that the nanny was one of several ' imaginary friends ' @entity9 had invented , and set out a new version of events : @entity1 drowned accidentally in the family pool on june 16 , 2008 and was fished out by her grandfather , who disposed of the body secretly and told his daughter never to reveal what had happened			1
@entity9 claims that she complied because she had been conditioned to obey and lie for her father as a result of him sexually abusing her as a child			0
mr @entity9 denies the accusations			0
@entity9 ’s defence team is arguing that @entity1 ’s remains were only dumped in the area a short while before they were found in december 2008 , calling several witnesses to try to back their claim			1
but several proved of more value to the prosecution , including an @entity43 ' team leader ' who testified that sections of the woodland could not be explored because they were waterlogged - water that prosecutors say later dried to reveal @entity1 ’s remains			1
photo evidence : an image showing the wooded area where @entity1 's remains were found in december , 2008 under questioning by the defence , mrs @entity100 denied in court today that she had despatched the private investigators to search that area			1
' i never sent those guys there , ' she said			0
but her son @entity191 contradicted his mother when called to the stand , revealing that he had had an argument with his mother in late 2008 over her decision to send the private investigators into the woods based on a tip from a psychic that the child was dead			2
' i was quite angry			0
it was the first time i had ever heard anyone in my family offer it up that they were willing to look for a deceased @entity1			1
before that , not in the realm of anybody ’s mindset , ' he said			0
' i was very angry that my folks decided to do that without keeping me in the loop			0
i could n’t believe that they could be even considering that caylee may no longer be with us			0
' victim : @entity9 , 25 , has pleaded not guilty to killing two - year - old @entity1 in the summer of 2008 @entity142 , a meter reader working near the @entity127 home in @entity18 on august 11 , 2008 , testified that he saw ' something that appeared a little odd ' when he stepped into the woods that day to relieve himself			1
but when police officers arrived there they seemed more ' enthralled ' by a dead rattlesnake and failed to check the mystery object , which he said ' appeared to look like a human skull			0
' ' everything became about the dead snake , ' he said , explaining the officers ’ visit			0
it was not until another call in december that @entity1 ’s remains were found			1
the defence , in its opening statement , has alluded to mr @entity142 as a ' morally bankrupt ' publicity - seeker , who they suggested had somehow obtained @entity1 ’s remains then planted them in the woods to reap a $ 225,000 reward			1
he has denied the claim			0
defence attempts to portray mr @entity142 as a villainous schemer failed to gain traction in court as recordings of three 911 calls that he made on august 11 , 12 and 13 , 2008 , were played to jurors , illustrating how he repeatedly tried to draw investigators ' attention to something ' odd ' in the woods without success			2
on the third call - out , he said , a deputy from @entity256 came to meet him at the woods but failed to conduct a thorough search			2
' he went down to the waterline , did this , did this , slipped on the mud then chewed me out for a half hour , ' he said , turning his head one way and then another to demonstrate how the officer carried out only a glancing search of the waterlogged area before giving up			1
the deputy has since been fired			0
on december 11 , with @entity1 still missing , mr @entity142 returned to the woods - where the water level had now dried up - and walked up to the mystery object for the first time			2
he discovered that it was a skull			0
unsure whether it was real , he poked a stick through the eye socket to inspect it more thoroughly			0
' i gently pivoted it up , i never took it off the ground , ' he stressed			0
' that was a very horrific thing for me to find			0
' the missed opportunities to find @entity1 's remains may have meant the loss of vital forensic clues			1
mr @entity142 stated that he was angry that the site had not been properly investigated when he called 911 four months earlier and that he had been treated like a time - waster and a liar			1
' i just simply tried to do the right thing and for my efforts to do the right thing and be a good citizen i basically got chewed up and called horrendous things ... yeah , i was pretty pissed off about that , ' he said			2

meter reader who found @entity1 's remains also testified today , saying that deputies did not search the area properly after he called 911 three times
