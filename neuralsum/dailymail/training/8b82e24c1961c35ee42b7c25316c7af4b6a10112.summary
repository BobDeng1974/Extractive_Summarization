by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 09:16 est , 18 february 2013 these mysterious @entity2 - like patterns are painted across dozens of locations in the @entity4 although they look rather similar to something you might be shown by an optician , they are not @entity11 's equivalent to an eye test			1
they are meant for another kind of all - seeing eye			2
the car park size patterns are used to calibrate the lenses of high - powered aerial and satellite cameras , of the kinds used by paranoid nations to keep an eye on their global rivals			1
a standard tri-bar test pattern off the runway at @entity26 , @entity27 : these mysterious @entity2 - like patterns painted across dozens of locations in the @entity4 are used to calibrate airborne and satellite cameras of obscure origin , it appears that most of them were put in place in the @entity34 and @entity35 , as the @entity4 - @entity37 superpower arms race led to the unprecedented fears of mutual annihilation			1
their existence has been highlighted by a recent newsletter by the @entity4 - based @entity43 , a group dedicated to researching ' human interaction with the @entity46 's surface '			1
the calibration sites follow a general form established by the @entity49 and @entity50 , the @entity43 notes			0
consisting of a concrete pad measuring 78ft by 53ft and coated in a heavy black and white paint , they are decorated with patterns consisting of parallel and perpendicular bars in 15 or so different sizes			2
this pattern , sometimes referred to as a 5:1 aspect @entity58 , is similar to those used to determine the zoom resolution of microscopes , telescopes , cameras , and scanners			0
the targets function like an optician 's eye chart , with the smallest group of bars discernable marking the limit of the resolution for the camera being tested , according to the @entity43			0
' for aerial photography , it provides a platform to test , calibrate , and focus aerial cameras traveling at different speeds and altitudes , ' the @entity43 adds			2
' the targets can also be used in the same way by satellites			0
' a tri-bar test pattern on the @entity81 at @entity82 in @entity83 : @entity83 's @entity85 desert is a resolution test target hot spot and is where many of the @entity4 's surveillance planes are tested an expanded tri-bar array at @entity91 , @entity92 : the targets function like an optician 's eye chart , with the smallest group of bars discernable marking the limit of the resolution for the camera being tested @entity83 's @entity85 , a principal test location for @entity4 surveillance aircraft like the @entity102 and the @entity103 , and more recently unmanned drones , is a resolution test target hot spot			1
@entity85 's @entity82 has the largest concentration of calibration targets of any spot in the @entity4 , with 15 running in a 20 mile line across the south - east side of the base			1
this allows a single test flight to test aircraft surveillance instruments on all the targets without having to change course or loop back			0
according to the @entity43 : ' there is some variation in the size and shape of the targets at @entity82 , suggesting updates and modifications for specific programs			0
' a number of the targets there also have aircraft hulks next to them , added to provide additional , realistic subjects for testing cameras			0
' some of these planes are themselves unusual and rare military jets , officially in the collection of the base museum , despite being left out on the range			0
' a tri-bar array at @entity138 , @entity139 : the total number of the sites across the @entity4 is unknown , but it is thought they have been rendered obsolete by the emergence of digital systems the report goes on to detail several other military bases and @entity50 sites with testing grids of different styles and sizes , although it adds that the total number across the @entity4 is unknown			1
despite their ubiquity , it seems that the tri-bar photo targets are increasingly becoming obselete thanks to the emergence of high - precision digital systems			1
' the arrangement and spacing of the lines is not well suited for computer analysis ( it 's not a continuous single row , but two or three rows of pairs ) , and it has other frequency and modulation issues that make determining sharpness by digital means inaccurate , ' says the @entity43 ' the @entity49 officially cancelled @entity170 for photographic lenses in 2006 , without replacement			2

car park - sized patterns used to calibrate lenses on planes and satellites
most built in the @entity34 and @entity35 at an unknown number of @entity4 locations
they have become obsolete thanks to new digital imaging systems
