@entity0 is the typical @entity1 boy who played in the streets when he was young – when the digital era was still to come			1
his streets , however , were one of the poorest in @entity6 , exactly in @entity7 , one of the more problematic neighborhoods in the @entity1 capital			0
@entity12 , as he ’s called by his family , played on those streets barefoot , because his family had no money to buy him soccer shoes			0
but the foot injuries did n't keep him at home			0
the soccer ball was everything			0
high flyer : @entity0 ( right ) is expected to be one of @entity23 's main players in @entity24 eyes on the prize : @entity0 shows off his fancy footwork during @entity23 's @entity29 training camp centre of attention : @entity0 evades @entity32 and @entity33 during @entity23 's friendly with @entity34 one day a scout from @entity36 , a local club , caught eyes on him and convinced @entity0 and his family to play for @entity39 he had lunch and dinner everyday , because they knew about his family difficulties			1
the winger played for the club between 1997 to 2003 , when he signed for @entity46 , after other proposals from , for example , @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity0 even today is grateful to his first club and he tries to help every time he can			2
he ’s one of the most humble @entity1 football players and that - along with his great skills - is why he always wins the trust of national coaches			0
@entity0 is probably the most technical @entity23 player in their @entity58 squad and is also in the top three of passing and assists abilities			1
handy work : @entity23 coach @entity63 is a big fan of @entity0 's skills in the shadow : @entity0 is hoping this @entity58 will be where he outshines team - mate @entity67 even if he did n’t have a great season with @entity69 , he was never in doubt for the @entity58 and was probably the second or the third player that coach @entity63 picked - only behind @entity67 and @entity73 , other key players			1
he ’s made the cut because in these big tournaments he usually does a great job			0
for example at @entity79 he was , for us @entity1 journalists , the best @entity1 player in that tournament alongside @entity67			2
we expect a great @entity58 from @entity0 because he arrives in @entity24 physically in shape and with few games in his legs , and that can be good for the @entity1 team			1
more importantly , he became a father last december , so will be full of confidence for this tournament			2
at the age of 27 this is the right time for him to shine at a @entity58			2
this will be his first @entity58 as he did n't make the 2010 edition in @entity96 due to a late injury , and he will want to prove that there is more to @entity23 's team than @entity67 .			1

@entity69 winger has had a *frustrating* season but comes to the @entity58 fresh , determined and full of confidence
@entity0 shone at @entity79 and will be expected to do so again in @entity24
@entity23 coach @entity63 has great faith in @entity0
