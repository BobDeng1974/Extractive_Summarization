an @entity1 woman who went on the run for six years rather than face jail over a fatal @entity4 has been linked to a second death - after allegedly treating a backpacker with an ' @entity8 potion ' at a backstreet @entity10 clinic			1
@entity11 , 36 - a former @entity12 stripper and prostitute - was handed a five - year sentence for mowing down truck driver @entity15 , 56 , in 2004			1
@entity11 was released on $ 50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to @entity17 , where she changed her name to @entity19 , switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her @entity1 passport			1
brazen : @entity11 , a 36 - year - old fugitive , was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six - year flight from justice in @entity17 victim : @entity30 went to @entity17 with his girlfreind @entity32 to attempt to kick drugs			1
he died after taking ibogaine at a ' clinic ' run by @entity36 and @entity37 , his mother and girlfriend said			1
the fugitive , who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run , was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the @entity1 to serve her original five - year jail term			1
however @entity45 can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered @entity10 clinic			2
@entity50 @entity30 , 33 , checked into the @entity17 retreat on @entity53 island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction			1
@entity11 – a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two @entity1 expats			1
victim : @entity11 killed @entity15 , left , when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor - trailer in @entity12 in 2004			1
@entity11 is pictured right in a mugshot from the time , when she was 26 former life : pictured is the gentlemen 's club in @entity67 , @entity12 , where @entity11 allegedly worked before fleeing to @entity17 all three have been accused of administering @entity30 with ibogaine , a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an @entity8 tree			1
the substance is used in tribal rituals in @entity74 and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction			0
however , the @entity78 warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous , and users say it sends them into a dream - like psychedelic state			0
mr @entity30 's girlfriend @entity32 , 26 , says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be @entity85 - during the $ 5,000 treatment last october			1
the clinic has denied giving mr @entity30 ibogaine , saying the backpacker from @entity90 , @entity91 , injected himself with an overdose of ‘ illegal narcotics ’			1
@entity17 's @entity94 took no action over the death - but mr @entity30 's mother @entity97 has called on the @entity50 government to push for a proper inquiry			1
she has also identified @entity11 as @entity19 - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat 's principal operators , @entity37 and @entity36 , both from @entity103 , @entity104			1
mr @entity36 is believed to be the father of @entity11 ’s baby boy , who was born two months ago on the island of @entity108			1
he told @entity10 authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive , according to the @entity112 newspaper			0
@entity11 was finally snared on the remote island of @entity114 , off the coast of @entity17 ’s @entity117 province , following a tip from the @entity1 embassy			1
drug clinic boss : @entity36 was one of the two business partners running the @entity123 ' clinic ' where @entity30 died			1
@entity30 's mother says @entity11 was the woman at the clinic who called herself ' @entity127 ' @entity128 : @entity11 was on the remote island of @entity114 when she was arrested by tourist police in @entity17 on tuesday			1
above , a view of the island difference : this home in @entity134 , @entity12 , is where @entity11 lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place @entity10 media reported that at around 9am tuesday local time , an officer with the @entity140 approached her in the parking lot of a @entity114 guesthouse and asked to see her passport			1
when she was unable to produce the document , the officer arrested her			0
the pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention , casually reapplying lip - gloss as the cameras rolled			0
@entity10 authorities suspect @entity11 's relatives in the @entity1 had been wiring money to help her make ends meet			1
but @entity11 's mother @entity156 , 70 , told @entity45 she ‘ laughed ’ when she read about the accusations , adding : ' there 's no money here to send her			2
' unmoved : @entity11 looked nonchalant , and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in @entity165 , @entity17 ' all my dreams now become impossible ' : @entity32 , from @entity168 , was with her boyfriend @entity30 when he tried to ' cure ' his drug addiction with ibogaine in @entity17 , she said			1
she went on : ' i only knew she was in @entity17 because the @entity173 told me			2
other than that all i know is what i hear on the tv			0
' she called me a few months back to say " @entity176 , i ’m pregnant , " that was the first time i 'd heard from her since she left			0
' had i had a chance to speak to her sooner , of course i would have told her to come back and turn herself in			0
' at least i know she 's finally coming home			0
’ another island : @entity53 island was where the unregistered clinic operated by @entity185 and @entity186 , both from @entity103 , @entity104 , was operating when @entity30 died			1
a third woman there , @entity19 , has been identified by the dead man 's mother as @entity11 , who was on the run from @entity12 @entity11 struck and killed @entity15 while driving drunk on @entity193 near her home in @entity195 , just south of @entity67 , in september 2004			1
the @entity197 truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when @entity11 hit his vehicle and careened into him			2
@entity11 was due to go on trial in january 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty			2
mission : @entity205 , the dead man 's mother , is campaigning for a murder probe into her son 's death			2
she identified @entity210 as ' @entity19 ' , the woman at the ' clinic ' when he died she was set to report to prison but fled @entity12 after making a $ 50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010			1
probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $ 10 - an - hour job to become a ‘ self - employed entertainer ’ making $ 4,000 a month			2
but @entity45 can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double - life as an exotic dancer and prostitute			2
a law enforcement source said : ' @entity210 is a very pretty girl from a good , upper - middle class family			1
‘ she 's not stupid			0
she 's entrepreneurial ; she ’s a survivor			0
she is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men			0
‘ this business in @entity17 fits exactly with the sort of person she is			2
she was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter			0
‘ there ’s no doubt she was working here as a prostitute			0
she probably carried on doing what she was good at in @entity17			0
’ @entity11 separated from her ex-husband @entity238 before her fatal @entity4 crash			0
mr @entity241 committed suicide in 2007 but his father @entity243 , 67 , insisted his death had nothing to do with @entity11 and described her as a ‘ pretty , sweet girl ’			2
former neighbors in the quiet @entity195 street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly			0
they told @entity45 they suspected she used her three - bedroom , $ 350,000 home as a set for porn films			2
business : @entity37 , of @entity103 , @entity104 , was the other business partner in the @entity254 where @entity30 went for treatment before he died			1
@entity256 : what @entity36 posted on @entity258 about what happened at the clinic one said : ' this is n't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a @entity265 or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend			2
' i do n't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes			0
' we would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits			0
the girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes			0
' the men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining			0
according to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries			0
' she had certainly had her breasts done			0
they were very big - we called her jugs			0
' quasi-scientific : @entity36 posted these pictures on @entity258 of his ' clinic '			2
it did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms			0
the mother of an @entity301 who died after attending the clinic says @entity11 was involved with it and @entity36 was the father of her baby @entity305 , the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted @entity11 said she would likely have only served half of her five - year jail sentence for killing mr @entity15 had she gone straight to prison			1
with good behaviour he predicts @entity11 will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more			2
‘ if she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years , ' he told @entity45			0
‘ now she 's got a two - month - old child , honestly i think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life			1
‘ it really hurt @entity15 ’s family when she ran			0
they are just profoundly grateful to the @entity173 for tracking her down			0
’ @entity321 : @entity123 is made from this root , of a plant found on the banks of a river in @entity326			0
it is illegal in the @entity1 and @entity91 and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects			2
