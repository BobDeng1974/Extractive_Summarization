many men have been known to experience a nauseating sinking feeling the moment they utter those two life - changing words - ' i do '			2
for @entity6 , it was n't cold feet that left him feeling queasy - but the prospect of falling hundreds of metres to his death after he lost his balance during the cliff - top ceremony in @entity13 , @entity14			1
strictly speaking , he was not getting married but renewing his vows with wife , @entity17 , when the seemingly terrifying incident happened			1
he shouts and fearfully flails his arms in the air as guests look on and display very little reaction			0
luckily , mrs @entity32 was on hand to grab her husband and prevent the happy occasion from turning into a tragedy			0
she manages to get a solid grip on his left arm before pulling him to safety			0
while the photos and video have proved a hit online , many are questioning whether the slip really was a close call - or in fact a choreographed stunt			0
either way , the couple , who married in 2009 , were able to laugh about the footage at the party that followed the mountain ceremony			2
mr @entity6 is rescued by @entity17 after losing his balance and leaning backwards over the precipice the relieved husband was pulled back to safety and was then able to carry on with the ceremony			1

@entity6 was *confirming* love for wife , @entity17 , in @entity13 , @entity14
the couple chose to hold the ceremony in *dramatic* cliff - edge *location*
but disaster strikes when mr @entity6 appears to *accidentally* lean backwards
luckily , wife comes to the rescue - *quickly* *clutching* hold of his flailing arm
