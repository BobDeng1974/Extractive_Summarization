there were plenty of laughs thrown up by this year ’s @entity4 gala			0
there was the look on @entity9 ’s face when he had to sit through a tribute from coach @entity11 , there was the look on @entity14 ’s face when @entity15 let out his primal scream , and there was the moment when @entity19 named the @entity21 team of the year and @entity22 was in ahead of @entity23			1
the battle - worn @entity24 who failed to make the team of the year despite and incredible 2014 might be overlooked on the world stage but no one at @entity29 is held in higher esteem by coach @entity31			1
last year when he knew he was going to lose players from his league winning squad he accepted it			0
there was only one condition – @entity23 must not be sold			2
@entity23 celebrates after scoring the goal that won @entity29 the league title last season @entity23 celebrates after scoring in the @entity42 final against rivals @entity43 first row from left : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
back row from left : @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity9 and @entity15 were in @entity19 's @entity54 he marshalled one of the meanest defences in @entity57 last season , showing the sort of leadership his coach demands from his most experienced players and he scored one of the most important goals in @entity29 ’s history			1
on the last day of last season when @entity65 took the lead against @entity29 to move ahead of them in the title race it was @entity23 who rose unmarked to head home a corner at the start of the second half to put @entity31 's side level			1
he wheeled away in celebration – kissing the badge in front of celebrating supporters – and made sure that the team did not concede in what was left of the game			2
it was the sixth time @entity65 had played @entity29 in what was to be their league - winning campaign and @entity65 's @entity9 - led forward line had failed to get the better of @entity31 ’s team on any of the previous occasions			2
that was largely down to @entity23 and now they had won the league because of his goal			0
he scored again in the @entity42 final although ultimately it was not enough to see them lift the @entity42			2
he then went off to @entity96 and got the goal against @entity98 that made sure @entity99 qualified for the last 16			0
all that apparently does n’t carry much weight with @entity21			0
they preferred @entity22 , who was part of a defence that shipped seven goals against @entity106			0
there is no accounting for some people ’s tastes			0
@entity22 also made the team of the year despite conceding seven goals against @entity106 at the @entity113 @entity31 believes @entity23 is the most important player in his @entity29 side @entity23 harries @entity65 forward @entity9 during their recent clash at the @entity117 @entity43 star @entity15 roars with delight after winning a third @entity4			1

@entity23 helped @entity29 win @entity120 last season
@entity23 also scored in the final of the @entity42
@entity31 rates him as @entity29 's most important player
but @entity22 made the @entity19 team of the year ahead of him
