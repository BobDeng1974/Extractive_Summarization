@entity1 manager @entity0 has urged striker @entity2 to build on his two - goal performance in the @entity4 against @entity6 side @entity5			1
the @entity7 international struck late on in the 6 - 2 third - round victory , but his overall display has given his manager encouragement for the future , especially with @entity13 away at the @entity14 with @entity15			1
' @entity2 probably has n't had the amount of minutes he would have liked ; he 's still played of course but in terms of why i brought him to the club you could see it there today , ' said @entity0			2
@entity1 forward @entity2 ( left ) holds off @entity5 ' midfielder @entity25 @entity2 scored twice during @entity1 's 6 - 2 @entity26 win over @entity5 on saturday @entity2 celebrating with team - mates @entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 ( centre ) ' hopefully he takes it into this next period now , he will be the first choice , and he is ready to go and hopefully he produces performances like that			1
' @entity39 , on - loan @entity36 midfielder @entity35 and @entity38 youngster @entity37 put the @entity40 into a comfortable lead just after half - time , before @entity43 fortuitously benefited from charging down goalkeeper @entity45 's clearance			0
however , @entity2 and substitute @entity29 struck - either side of @entity48 's header - to ensure there was no late drama			2
' we were very comfortable and i thought we controlled the whole game , ' added @entity0			0
' we managed to get some good goals and played some good football at a place where it can always be difficult			0
' they got a couple of goals which could have made it tricky but we responded really well , but i think we controlled it from start to finish			0
' @entity1 boss @entity0 has urged @entity2 to keep on scoring after his goals against @entity5 @entity1 will be without @entity13 ( right ) who is at the @entity14 with the @entity15 @entity5 boss @entity66 has greater concerns than the @entity4 with his side second - bottom of @entity6 and admitted the gulf in class was too much to bridge without some luck , which they did not get			1
' i think there are key moments in the game and my players are saying there is a definite handball for the first goal , ' he said			0
' if we come in at half - time at 0 - 0 it is a different game but , having said that , i thought @entity1 's application and attitude was spot on - we were hoping to catch them on an off - day			1
' when we are chasing the game the scoreline flatters them somewhat but that is the difference , that is what you pay all your money for goalscorers and they have had them today and they showed their quality			0
