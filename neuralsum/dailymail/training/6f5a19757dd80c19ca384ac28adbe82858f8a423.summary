by @entity0 a teenager nicknamed ' @entity1 's ' because of his love of the fast food chicken chain has had its logo tattooed on his bottom , only for his request for free meals to be given the cold shoulder			1
@entity1 's superfan @entity12 had the cockerel mascot @entity14 permanently etched on his right buttock as a sign of his love for the restaurant			1
however , when the 19 - year - old from @entity20 , @entity21 , contacted the company asking for a reward for his customer loyalty , his request was rebuffed			1
cheeky : @entity12 got the inking done during a holiday to @entity29 , @entity30 in july 2013			1
the etching took two hours and cost him 90 euros favourite : mr @entity12 , 19 , says he eats at @entity32 's every time he goes out for dinner , and estimates that he spends more than £ 1,500 at @entity1 's every year ' ever since i first tried their @entity36 chicken five years ago , i ’ve been crazy about @entity1 ’s			1
i ’m a huge fan , ' said mr @entity12 , who estimates that he spends more than £ 1,500 at @entity1 ’s every year			1
' whenever i go out for a meal now , it ’s always @entity1 ’s			2
i order the same thing every time - an extra-hot whole chicken to myself , garlic bread and a bottomless drink			0
' my friends and locals around my hometown call me " @entity32 " because i love it so much			0
people are always asking me to get my bum out so they can see my tattoo			0
' the assistant store manager got the inking done during a holiday to @entity29 , @entity30 in july 2013			1
the etching took two hours and cost him 90 euros			0
' i was feeling hungover after a night out and all week , i had been craving a nice @entity1 ’s			2
i was telling my mates about it and they suggested i get a tattoo of it			0
i thought that sounded right up my street			0
' so i went to the nearest tattoo parlour and asked for the @entity32 ’s cockerel on my bum cheek			0
the whole process was painful especially after the alcohol had worn off but it was worth it			0
' after having the inking done , mr @entity12 contacted @entity1 ’s in the hope they would offer some thanks for his dedication			1
' i emailed @entity1 ’s to tell them that i got the tattoo of their chicken on my bum because i really liked the restaurant , ' he said			2
worthwhile : mr @entity12 said that while getting his tattoo had been painful , getting the inking was still ' worth it ' ' i asked if they rewarded customer loyalty like this and they snubbed my questions saying they do n’t give any free meals or vouchers to customers			1
' i ’m really angry about it			0
surely i ’m due something for my commitment to @entity32 ’s			0
i just wanted a small token so i was gutted when they gave me nothing			0
' you always see @entity32 ’s giving free stuff to celebrities and footballers but they never reward ordinary , loyal customers like me			2
' mr @entity12 said his ideal prize would be the much - celebrated ‘ black card ’ , which guarantees free food for life at @entity32 ’s and is rumoured to have been given to stars such as @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , while singer @entity104 and boxer @entity105 have posted pictures online of their prized ' high five ' cards			1
' if @entity1 ’s gave me the black card , i ’d get the image of the card tattooed on my left bum cheek to complete the look , ' said mr @entity12			1
rebuffed : when mr @entity12 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , contacted the company asking for a reward for his customer loyalty , his request was rebuffed response : instead of the card , or a voucher , mr @entity12 instead received an email stating : ' while we love your dedication to @entity36 , we unfortunately ca n't give you a @entity131 or a voucher ' threat : mr @entity12 replied to @entity1 's and said he would be inclined to turn to a rival chicken chain @entity135 on : mr @entity12 's friends encouraged him to get the tattoo after he told them he was craving @entity1 's food ' the staff can scan my behind when i come in to the restaurant			1
' instead of the card , or a voucher , mr @entity12 instead received an email stating : ' while we love your dedication to @entity36 , we unfortunately ca n't give you a @entity131 or a voucher			1
' despite @entity32 ’s ignoring his efforts , mr @entity12 says he has no regrets about the inking			2
however he admits that his cheeky tattoo has received mixed reviews from the opposite sex			0
' some girls love it but others think i ’m an idiot for having the tattoo			0
i do n’t care though , they ’re obviously not the right girl for me anyway			0
' i always take girls out to @entity1 ’s on a first date so it would be a nightmare if they did n’t like the restaurant			2
' @entity32 ’s was founded in @entity167 , @entity168 in 1987 and operates over 1,031 outlets in 24 countries			0
in 2012 , the restaurant chain reported sales of £ 350million ( $ 650m )			2
fans : rumoured @entity115 in a @entity175 branch of @entity1 's only openly acknowledged by @entity1 's in 2010 , the chicken chain 's fabled high five card , or @entity131 , is so prized as it grants its very select list of owners and their friends unlimited free meals at the restaurants			1
many owners are discreet about the cards , but celebrities including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity186 , @entity113 and @entity187 , and even @entity188 are rumoured to have them			1
@entity189 @entity104 has posted a photograph where he proudly poses with a @entity131 , and has written a song with rapper example ( who claims he was the first person to ever get a @entity194 card ) - entitled @entity195			2
and asking for a card wo n't help fans of the chain to get their hands on them , as the company says anyone who has requested a card , ' no matter how politely ' , will ever receive one			0
' asking for one is simply the biggest taboo - a definite no no , ' the chain states on its website in a post entitled ' @entity209 , @entity210 or @entity211 '			0
the website also states : ' you 've heard rumours about it - a card that magically provides free @entity32 's for a whole year			2
' the mythical @entity1 's high five card - can you be sure it really exists ? or , like unicorns and @entity219 , is it just a legend - one created by @entity1 's to give fans a holy grail to yearn for ? ' when you consider that the average meal in @entity32 's costs around £ 10 , including a bottomless soft drink , for a celebrity to eat there twice a month with five of their friends it would be worth around £ 1,200 a year .			1
