hop-less ! kangaroos are descended from giant ten - foot ( three metres ) creatures that were too heavy to hop , new research suggests			1
their extinct ancestors strode around the @entity6 outback 100,000 years ago , walking on two legs professor @entity19 , from @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , said : ‘ i do n't think they could have gotten that large unless they were walking			1
’ the team , whose research was published last night in the journal @entity29 , analysed bones from more than 140 past and present kangaroo and wallaby skeletons , making nearly 100 measurements of each animal			0
unlike modern red and grey kangaroos , the giant animals called sthenurine kangaroos that preceded them lacked specialised features geared for rapid hopping			1
their bone structure indicated they had an upright posture and were able to support their weight on one foot at a time			2
it was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven - stone frame that they learned to bounce			1
modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity6 outback ( pictured ) large - bodied sthenurine kangaroos - a now extinct relative to modern - day kangaroos - first appeared in the middle @entity65 period and became extinct in the @entity66			1
they were too heavy to hop and instead walked on two legs			1
the largest of these kangaroos weighed around 38 stone ( 240kg ) - almost three times as much as a modern kangaroo			2
larger hip and knee joints , as well as more stable ankle joints , meant the large animals were more suited to walking			1
it was only when kangaroos shrunk from 40 stone to a weight closer to their current seven - stone frame that they learned to bounce			1
modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity6 outback			1
the creatures had large hips and knees and stable ankle joints that would have helped them walk on two legs			1
their hands were poorly suited for moving on all fours , but adapted for foraging			0
modern kangaroos are thought to have developed their distinctive hopping motion as an efficient way to travel the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity6 outback			1
using elasticity in the tendons of their large legs to bounce is an effective , low - energy way to move at speed for long periods			2
but it only remains efficient if body weight remains low			2
the giant ancient kangaroos would simply have been too heavy , the scientists suggest			2
professor @entity19 said : ‘ people often interpret the behaviour of extinct animals as resembling that of the ones known today , but how would we interpret a giraffe or an elephant known only from the fossil record ? ‘ we need to consider that extinct animals may have been doing something different from any of the living forms , and the bony anatomy provides great clues			2
’ whether or not reliance on walking rather than faster and more efficient hopping led to the ancient kangaoroos becoming extinct is unknown			0
professor @entity19 said they may have struggled to elude human hunters , or been unable to migrate far enough to find food as the climate became more arid			1
in july , scientists from @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 in @entity137 discovered that a kangaroo ’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined			0
' we found that when a kangaroo is walking , it uses its tail just like a leg , ' said associate professor @entity147 of @entity148 in in @entity136 , @entity137			0
‘ they use it to support , propel and power their motion			0
in fact , they perform as much mechanical work with their tails as we do with one of our legs			0
' ' what we did n't expect to find was how much power the tails of the kangaroos were producing			2
it was pretty darn surprising , ’ said associate professor @entity164 at the @entity165			0
this summer , scientists discovered that a red kangaroo 's tail provides as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined			0
the tail skeleton of a kangaoo is pictured right red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in @entity6			2
when grazing on grass , they move both hind feet forward ' paired limb ' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies			0
' they appear to be awkward and ungainly walkers when one watches them moseying around in their mobs looking for something to eat , ' said professor @entity164			0
' but it turns out it is not really that awkward , just weird			0
' in human movement , the back foot acts as the gas pedal and the front foot acts as a brake , which is not especially efficient , said professor @entity164			0
professor @entity147 said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg			0
‘ their tails have more than 20 vertebrae , taking on the role of our foot , calf , and thigh bones			0
' the kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders , then rear back and kick each other in the stomach in an attempt to assert dominance for the purpose of reproduction .			0

kangaroos are descended from giant ten - foot ( three metre tall ) creatures
they were too heavy to hop and instead walked on two legs
creatures had large hips and knees and stable ankle joints , ideal for walking
it was only when the animals shrunk and lost weight that they learned to bounce , according to researchers at @entity20 in @entity21
modern kangaroos are thought to hop in order to efficiently cover the large distances needed to find food on the arid @entity6 outback
