by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 13 august 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 13 august 2013 @entity1 can now walk thanks to a pioneering operation that involves using magnets to lengthen bones a teenager has been given pioneering treatment using magnets to slowly lengthen her right leg			1
until recently @entity1 , 17 , struggled to walk because of a pelvic deformity and curved spine that has left her in crippling pain			1
but after becoming the youngest patient in the @entity14 to undergo a new treatment , miss @entity1 is quickly gaining independence and recovering well			1
surgeons have fitted a telescopic rod in her right thigh which will slowly lengthen and extend the limb by 6cm			1
the metal rod is controlled by magnets and @entity1 must use a remote control at home to gradually lengthen her leg by 1mm each day			1
she will repeat the procedure 60 times , eventually adding 6cm to her leg to correct her deformity and the rod will be removed in a year ’s time			1
ms @entity1 , who lives with optical assistant mother @entity31 , 43 , electrician father @entity32 , 51 , and younger brother @entity33 , 13 , explained the groundbreaking operation			1
she said that inside the rod is a magnetic gear , and when she hovers her magnet above her right kneecap , the magnets repel one another , which twists and pulls the rod apart to extend the leg by 1mm a day			1
miss @entity1 , from @entity44 in @entity45 , is so delighted with her progress and the work of doctors at @entity49 she now wants to study to become an orthopaedic surgeon			1
she said : ' i was worried and excited because i knew i was the youngest person to have this surgery but i had a lot of confidence in the surgeon			1
' the doctors decided it was better for me to have this operation because i ’m hoping to be a spinal surgeon so i ’ll spend the majority of my time standing up			0
' if they lengthen my leg it will mean the pain should subside everywhere else			2
' i did want to be a dance teacher but then i got really interested in orthopaedic surgery and now i ’d like to be a surgeon			2
' we ’ve been to conferences and met a few people who know about my condition but no one has seen anything like it			0
' the doctors in @entity74 have been fantastic and i ’m really glad they recommended me for this operation so i can beat the pain			0
' until recently miss @entity1 took 13 painkillers a day because of her disability			1
she had a twisted sacrum - the large , triangular bone at the base of the spine - and was left with one hip almost touching her rib cage			0
the metal rod is controlled by magnets and @entity1 uses a scanner at home to gradually lengthen her leg by 1mm each day			1
she will repeat the procedure 60 times , eventually adding 6cm to her leg to correct her deformity and the rod will be removed in a year ¿ s time in addition to this , her legs were not aligned correctly and were tilted to the opposite side			1
she said : ' i 've had to live with the pain gradually getting worse for years so when the operation came up , it completely changed my life			2
' i 've had problems since birth and i realised that i always had a short leg but did nothing about it			2
' when i was 13 , i had a 3d scan performed which then made me realise that my pelvis was deformed			0
' the pain gradually got worse , and in my teenage years the pain has become as bad as ever			2
' it was constant and was taking a toll on my breathing			0
sometimes i physically could n't take anymore			0
' i had to give up doing @entity115 in school in year 8 , and had to give up dancing			0
' surgeons inserted the rod in a four - hour operation after breaking her upper leg bone but left just six tiny scars			2
the rod , called the @entity125 , has been used in the @entity126 but never before in someone so young			0
just 330 of the operations have been carried out across the globe and only ten have been performed in the @entity14 , all on adults			0
the procedure reduces pain and scarring and means the patient can be up and about quicker after surgery			2
orthopaedic surgeon @entity138 said : ' it ’s been fantastic to be able to perform this operation on the youngest person so far			1
' this new technology we ’re using is very advanced			0
we are starting to be able to use this on patients who are younger and younger			0
' our centre is known internationally for its orthopaedic work			0
' we advise and treat hundreds of children every year with limb abnormalities and are a major centre for training the next generation of paediatric orthopaedic surgeons			0
' hopefully now we can treat more children in this way reducing the pain and recovery time			0

@entity1 , 17 , struggled to walk because of a painful pelvic deformity
she is now the youngest person to have undergone a pioneering surgery that involves *implanting* a metal rod into her leg to lengthen it
the rod is controlled by magnets and miss @entity1 must use a remote control at home to gradually lengthen her leg by 1mm each day
the procedure must be repeated 60 times , to add 6cm to her leg and correct her deformity
