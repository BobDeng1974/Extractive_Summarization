@entity45 @entity1 , 34 , a firearms officer with the @entity24 , alleges that her career has been held back because a senior male officer did not treat her equally because of her race and sex ' it has been a long struggle and i just want justice to be done			1
i want the truth to come out , ' the 10 - year veteran said he said : ' he got a reputation for aggressive and intrusive management and for generally being a bully			0

the 34 - year - old 's case is being funded by the @entity103 and has been going on for two years last week commissioner sir @entity104 called for a change in the law to allow positive discrimination to recruit more black and ethnic minority officers			2
@entity8 will have to recruit an ethnic minority officer for every white officer they take on , under radical plans to shake off its reputation for racism in the ranks			2
