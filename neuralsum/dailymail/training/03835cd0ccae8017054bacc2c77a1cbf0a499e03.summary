by @entity0 the worst job in @entity2 is that of a lumberjack , according to a new ranking of the @entity2 job market			1
and the best is a mathematician , with an average salary of over $ 100,000 , says @entity8 , which takes into account a combination of factors including income , environment , growth opportunity and stress			1
following close behind lumberjacks , who earn a pitiful $ 24,000 a year , the most awful occupation of 2014 is that of a newspaper reporter , and then an active military personnel , while being a university professor and then a statistician were found to be the next best jobs			1
happy camper : mathematicians , university professors and dental hygienists ranked amongst the best jobs of 2014 , according to @entity29 , in terms of salary and overall job satisfaction ( stock image ) in contrast , being a university professor or a statistician were found to be among the best jobs			1
being a whiz with numbers in today 's job market provides a wide range of well - paid opportunities , according to mathematician @entity43			1
' whether it â€™s new product sales , a start - up business model or an established tv station , for example , everything is based on numbers , ' she says to @entity29			1
tenured university professors , though a difficult role to score , enjoy highly rewarding careers , while software engineers and computer systems analysts thrive in an ever - expanding market where they are in high demand			1
woeful job : just behind lumberjacks , newspaper reporters and broadcasters were ranked as having some of the worst jobs in 2014 , thanks mainly to the changing face of the media somewhat interestingly , dental hygienists come in at number six on the best jobs list , gifted with competitive salaries averaging $ 70,210 and flexible working hours , despite dentists historically having the second highest ( after doctors ) suicide rate of any profession in the @entity2 other healthcare roles in the top ten best jobs list include ear doctors , occupational therapists and speech pathologists			1
as for the worst jobs in the @entity2 , a number of unsurprising roles cropped up , including taxi drivers at number four , garbage collectors at number eight and prison guards at number ten			1
newspaper reporters took the second spot , followed by broadcasters at number five ; high - stress , low - paid positions which are fast disappearing as print publications fall into a black hole			1
open wide : dental hygienists were ranked as having the sixth best job this year in terms of wages and flexible hours , despite dentists actually having the second highest suicide rate of any profession in the @entity2 new to the list this year as the sixth worst job title was ' head cook ' - not to be confused with the esteemed role of a chef ( celebrity or otherwise ) - but more hourly workers in chains or high school cafeterias			1
and noble firefighters came in at number nine , for the high danger they find themselves in every day , in return for relatively meager wages			1
considering we spend most of our waking lives at work , it 's either an affirming or somewhat depressing set of findings , depending of course , on where we happen to show up to the office every day			2
