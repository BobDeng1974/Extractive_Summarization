the @entity6 government is set to be given the powers to reduce taxes in an attempt to attract businesses and individuals to the country from other parts of the @entity15			0
officials hope the move will help to reduce inequality between the various regions of @entity15			0
idyllic : but new efforts to attract @entity2 people to @entity6 are set to centre around tax cuts for high earners rather than picturesque landscapes @entity27 prices in @entity6 are around two thirds of the @entity15 average , which could tempt @entity2 homeowners forced to devote most of their salary to mortgage repayments			1
and experts have recommended that the @entity34 should be given the power to make @entity6 more business - friendly by varying tax rates in the country			1
currently the devolved governments in @entity6 and @entity40 have no tax - raising powers , but the @entity42 will be allowed to set its own rates from 2016			2

@entity55 said : ' if some elements of income tax are devolved , it would be necessary to look at a period of reduced taxation for those paying the 40 per cent tax rate			0
' this would not only send out a strong sign to business in competing regions of the @entity15 , but it would spell out that @entity6 is well and truly open for business			0
' some 64 per cent of residents in @entity6 would support the devolution of income tax , according to a poll conducted for the @entity44			2
capital : @entity6 politicians hope that their new tax powers would attract people to @entity86 and other cities currently just seven per cent of @entity6 taxpayers are subject to the 40 per cent rate - 1 in 16 - compared to 1 in 10 in @entity2			1
the @entity15 government spends more than £ 6,000 on @entity6 per head of population , meaning that @entity93 is keen to reduce the country 's dependency on more economically vibrant areas like @entity97 and @entity98			0
as well as making @entity6 a more attractive place to live and do business , giving the @entity34 the power to determine tax rates would boost interest in the devolved government			1
