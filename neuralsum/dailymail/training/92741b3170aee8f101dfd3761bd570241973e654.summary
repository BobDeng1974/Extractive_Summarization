she explained : ' you do n't always remember the abductions because you have memory swipes			1

' when @entity8 queried if this is what most of us what describe as a dream she replied : ' no definitely not			0
i 've woken up with marks all over my body and been possessed - sometimes to the point of mind control - where thoughts come into your head that are not your own			2
i ca n't explain it any other way			2

the frequency of helicopter sightings over people who have had alien abductions is phenomenal , ' she said			0

unexplained injuries : @entity1 says she has woken up covered in needle marks and bruises following her abductions supernatural : other @entity122 viewers said they have experienced @entity123 @entity80 said some of these people have been examined by mri scans and black light frequency 48 hours after their experience and this has shown florescent marks such as handprints on their bodies			1

their survey of 1500 men and women found that almost one in three think they may have seen a @entity123 and the same number think they have seen a ghost			1
nearly one in five had visited a medium but almost half of them felt cheated by the person claiming to have psychic powers			2
a third say they have experienced items vanishing or moving or odd bumps in the night			0
sixty per cent do n't believe it 's possible to move an object with the power of your mind but 20 per cent believe you can have sex with ghosts			2
the results also revealed that @entity1 is n't the only one to feel a victim of alien abduction , as four per cent said it had also happened to them			1
a spokesman from this morning said : ' our viewers are fascinated by the supernatural and these survey results show that many have had an encounter with a ghost , seen @entity123 's and would like to make contact with the dead			1
' during the week our hosts - some reluctantly - will explore the supernatural world more closely with experts and will also try to find evidence of the afterlife themselves			0
' indeed , a phone in from viewers later in the today 's show revealed others have had experiences of @entity123			1
