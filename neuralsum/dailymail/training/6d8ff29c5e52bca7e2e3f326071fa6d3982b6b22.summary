by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:15 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 13:20 est , 11 december 2012 mps are set to probe @entity4 's use of controversial spydrones after a report found pilots are poorly - trained and being ' pushed to the limits '			1
the @entity9 will examine @entity4 's increasing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity12 ) after an investigation by the @entity14 found surging demand is ' constraining the length of time available to train and qualify ' new operators			1
it found soldiers with no past experience could be in charge of piloting a spydrone after just 25 hours flying time			0
the @entity24 is the @entity26 's first ' hunter - killer ' unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity12 ) and is designed to engage time - sensitive targets on the battlefield as well as provide intelligence and surveillance a review was ordered after the crash of a @entity35 ( @entity36 ) unmanned aircraft at @entity37 , the main @entity4 base in @entity38 , last year			1
operated by the @entity40 personnel with the @entity41 from @entity42 , the surveillance drone 's engine cut out in mid-air after overheating			2
failings identified could lead to another incident unless action was taken , said investigators			0
' unless urgently addressed , the contributory factors identified ... are likely to continue to affect @entity36 operations and may contribute to a further accident , ' the report said			0
investigation : chair of the @entity57 @entity56 says the body will look into the @entity4 's use of drone planes to kill insurgents the report raised concerns about the selection of drone operators , their training and development , and their poor knowledge of air - traffic control rules			1
air marshal @entity70 , head of the aviation authority , demanded more than 60 changes to the operation of @entity4 's nine @entity36 drones after reading the report			1
all have been accepted and are being implemented			0
but he warned ministers that the flaws that were exposed made for ' uncomfortable reading '			0
' the findings may be interpreted as pointing to an organisation pushing the limits of organic air competence , ' he wrote			0
about half of @entity35 pilots had to be taught from scratch for each tour of duty			2
' the truncated training pipeline is producing @entity36 pilots and commanders to a standard that is " just enough , just in time " , ' the report said			2
members of the @entity93 revealed yesterday they would probe the deployment of @entity12 in the fight against the @entity96			2
as well as the @entity36 , the @entity4 has five £ 10million @entity24 drones armed with missiles currently operated by @entity100 personnel from @entity101 at @entity102 in @entity103			2
but five new @entity12 will be controlled above the skies of southwest @entity38 by airmen sitting at computer screens 4,000 miles away in the @entity4 by @entity107			1
the @entity14 report does not touch upon the @entity109			2
unveiling the inquiry @entity56 , the @entity111 chairman of the cross-party committee , said there were ' issues about the remoteness of the dealing of death that are important '			0
the investigation will look at ’ the effect of changes in the interpretation of the law on the prosecution of operations , and the use of remotely piloted aircraft '			0
@entity127 is also calling for a new set of rules to govern the deployment of the unmanned aerial vehicles - especially when engaged in missions to kill @entity38 insurgents			1
a new batch of drones , known as squadron 13 , were put into action at an @entity139 ceremony last month shadow armed forces minister @entity140 said : ' we must clarify the rules , given the significance and spread of the technology ' whether valid or not , there is a public perception that unmanned technology is shrouded in secrecy , which increases the potential for its demonisation			0
' he spoke out as mps debated @entity4 's involvement in drone warfare			1
the @entity139 ( @entity139 ) has revealed that the @entity4 's @entity109 had flown more than 39,000 hours and fired at least 334 laserguided hellfire missiles and bombs			1
but it says only four @entity38 civilians have been killed in strikes since 2008			0
military chiefs say the drones give allied forces an edge over the @entity96 by monitoring an entire battlefield and carrying out strikes against insurgents			0
but human rights campaigners claim the @entity170 - built aircraft kill and injure large numbers of civilians and breach international law			0
the military is likely to use unarmed @entity12 to undertake reconnaissance patrols around the coast of the @entity4 and for @entity178 operations rather than replacing the @entity100 's @entity180 spy planes			1
a spokesman for the @entity183 @entity4 pressure group , which has raised concern over @entity4 's use of @entity12 , said : ' the inquiry is a welcome step forward , but as always the devil is in the detail and we look forward to seeing the proposed scope and remit of the inquiry			1

surging demand means pilots do *n't* get enough training , says @entity14
@entity199 ordered after @entity35 crashed at @entity37 last year
