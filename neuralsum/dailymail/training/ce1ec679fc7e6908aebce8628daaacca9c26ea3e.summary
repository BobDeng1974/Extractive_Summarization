by @entity0 the 1812 @entity1 may have its cannons , but there has never been a symphony quite like the one performed in @entity5 this week where all the ' music ' was provided by roaring farm tractors			1
the resulting cacophony left audience members baffled and a little deaf after watching 12 diesel behemoths whining , groaning and belching out exhaust smoke for nearly half - an - hour			1
the tractor symphony was performed in the @entity5 city of @entity16 and opened the country 's oldest festival of contemporary music , which has been running since 1978			2
' yes , i am the soloist , ' said the driver of one old tractor , a farmer named @entity35			0
' there are few tractors like this , and the director likes a lot of noise , ' he added			2
audience member @entity42 said : ' it was a load of old rubbish			1
it might appeal to anoraks who like to listen to the different strains of engines , and get their jollies sniffing diesel smoke , but anyone who likes music was left baffled			1
however , audience members were left unimpressed , with one onlooker calling it ' a load of old rubbish ' the festival director said he wanted to break the stereotype that all classical music was ' elitist ' ' i think they would have been better opening the festival with a load of half - empty water glasses being played			1
at least they would have made a tune			0
this lot sounded like a garage workshop on a bad day			0
' @entity72 , director of the music festival , said : ' we wanted to start this festival breaking the stereotype that the contemporary music is elitist			0
' @entity78 , clarinettist and also the driver of one of the tractor , said : ' it is an adventure , a new experience			0
' ' it certainly was , ' added @entity85 , another audience member			2
' and not one i want to repeat			0

twelve tractors played symphony and conducted by @entity26
he use different diesel engines to *create* notes during half - hour number
however unimpressed audience members *branded* it ' a load of old rubbish '
