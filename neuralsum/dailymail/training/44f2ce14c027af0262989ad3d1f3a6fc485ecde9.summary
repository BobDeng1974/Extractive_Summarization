with holiday travel upon us , many jet - setters will be venturing to new and distant locales over the upcoming winter months			2
but with these exotic destinations and once - in - a - lifetime experiences may also come a very real fear of unknowingly falling victim to a dreaded travel scam			1
whether it 's a taxi driver attempting to overcharge your fare or an airport tag - team stealing belongings at security checkpoint , @entity9 has highlighted the seven most common travel scams - and how to avoid them			1
heading stateside ? fake wake - up calls are of particular concern and it 's not uncommon for an unsuspecting hotel guest to receive a late - night call from a caller pretending to be from the hotel front desk , asking for credit card information			0
in such an instance , hang up - and call the front desk yourself to confirm that it was really them and not a prisoner using a smuggled cell phone			0
for those taking a quick weekend break to @entity32 , be on the look out for fake plain clothes police officers with semi-legitimate looking badges and be sure not to fall victim to the infamous ' baby toss			1
' a scheme used by groups of panhandlers or beggars , a woman will toss something toward you that vaguely resembles a swaddled baby			0
before a tourist can realise that the ' baby ' is really just a doll , the group has already made off with money or valuables			0
keep in mind , however , that these horror stories are n't meant to scare - instead , they are cautionary tales to encourage holidaymakers to be vigilant and aware of those who may look to take advantage			2
@entity9 spokesperson @entity56 said : ' highly - organised tourist cams play on travellers ' trusting nature , their lack of local knowledge and desire to save a bit of cash			1
' ' often , victims do n't realise they 've been caught out until it 's too late			0
even the most seasoned traveller may be targeted in unfamiliar surroundings , so minimise risk by keeping your passport secure , your belongings close to your body , and by leaving all unnecessarily expensive items at home			1
' our key piece of advice is to keep your wits about you at all times , ' she added .			0
