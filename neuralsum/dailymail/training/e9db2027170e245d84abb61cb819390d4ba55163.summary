irate parents have confronted @entity1 in the playground at her daughter 's private school after she mocked them online in a row over donations towards birthday gifts			1
the @entity8 and musician was harangued by other middle - class mothers on the school run who accused her ' betraying ' them by leaking private emails online			1
miss @entity1 , 36 , had revealed a parent had asked others to donate a ' suggested £ 10 ' to buy their children birthday gifts , including a @entity19 , and leave the cash in the child 's school bag			1
but when she arrived to pick up daughter @entity23 , seven , from her school in north @entity25 yesterday afternoon the broadcaster was berated by mothers who said her criticism was a ' cheap - shot '			1
' other furious parents have written and emailed the headteacher of the £ 5,000 - a - term school accusing her of using the personal emails of fellow parents to get press attention			1
' it was a very distasteful and cheap shot , ' wrote one			0
one furious mother , who asked not to be named , said : ' she has betrayed our confidences and belittled us so publicly			0
lots of people have complained			0
' another said : ' it is so out of order			0
she is n't going to have any friends left			0
' another defended the present arrangement saying : ' it is to make it easier for parents so they do n't buy expensive presents that nobody wants			2
' there is no obligation			0
@entity1 has misunderstood the school 's community spirit			1
' many are baffled why the star would tweet the emails over a year after they were sent			2
one said : ' it is bang out of order			0
these are old class emails from a year ago			2
' the emails posted by @entity84 did not have dates on them but stated the party is due to take place on february 9th			2
last night several parents claimed they were a year old			2
today miss @entity1 did not drop her daughter at school			1
mockery : ms @entity1 posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents , as well as her response problems began after 36 - year - old @entity84 , the former pop star turned @entity100 presenter , posted on social media two emails she had received ' from some school mums ' , after first changing the names			1
gift - giving has become a big business in many top private schools as parents vie to curry favour with teachers			2
@entity111 magazine reported last year that some teachers had been given presents as lavish as £ 1,000 handbags , diamond necklaces and cases of vintage wine			0
at one school , parents even offered teachers the chance to use their private jet			1
a mother at a @entity25 prep school said that she was emotionally blackmailed into donating £ 90 - the minimum amount acceptable - to a fund for teachers ' gifts			1
some schools have had to introduce new rules capping the value of presents teachers can accept - at @entity134 , for example , staff must declare any gifts above £ 50 the first email read : ' @entity138 and @entity139 would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year			2
@entity143 would like a kindle and @entity145 a desk ( very studious choices ! ) so if you would like to join in , please can i collect a suggested £ 10 from you before the party on february 9			1
' if you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [ sic ] school bag , marked for @entity138 / me that works too			2
i will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party			0
@entity158 [ sic ] and no obligation of course			0
' a second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £ 10 would be a ' popular amount ' to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £ 200 – but adds : ' feel free to give what you like or indeed , to give your own gift			1
' shortly after , miss @entity1 published her stinging reply in which she said she was collecting ' unicorn money ' towards a ' real , live unicorn ' for @entity23			1
warming to her theme , she added : ' i 'd like a @entity176 and @entity175 , so by all means , do feel obligated to contribute to this too			0
' and making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners , she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com			0
mother : ms @entity1 was making fun of parents whose children attend the same school as her daughter @entity23 miss @entity1 , who lives in @entity25 , entitled her reply ' let 's put the fun back into @entity195 ! ' and shared it with her 459,200 followers on @entity197 and 75,000 on @entity198			1
hours later , she was confronted in the playground as she picked up @entity23 from her school			2
on parenting website @entity202 , opinion was divided			0
one wrote : ' well good on her for shaming these grabby idiots			0
it 's crass and rude to ask for money instead of a gift			0
' another posted : ' one of the mums asked to do this at our school ! i think it 's so rude ! ' but others sided with the parents asking for money			1
one wrote : ' what 's wrong with asking for contributions towards a larger present ? it seems much more sensible than getting 30 presents which you have to find room for and may not be played with			0
' a spokesman for @entity84 , who also has a three - year - old daughter , hero , declined to comment			0
star : the entertainer , pictured on @entity198 today , rose to fame as a member of @entity233 and is now a television and radio presenter @entity8 : ms @entity1 has a show on @entity100 as well as hosting other tv and radio programmes			1
