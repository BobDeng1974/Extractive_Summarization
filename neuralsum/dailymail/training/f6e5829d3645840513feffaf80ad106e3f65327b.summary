by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ for @entity5 , the @entity4 player that never was , it ended as inauspiciously as it began			1
last tuesday , at the dingy @entity11 , the home of @entity10 side @entity8 , the curtain came down on @entity5 ’s peculiar career at @entity4			1
having underwhelmed once more for the reserve team , he was substituted after 45 minutes but emerged early from @entity16 ’s half - time dressing down and took his place on the substitute ’s bench			0
it was there that supporters asked the @entity24 winger if he would be leaving this summer and with a big grin , @entity5 brazenly replied : ‘ i go , i go , i go ’			0
incredibly , for a player that did not start a @entity38 match in four years at @entity39 , @entity4 received £ 2.3million from @entity33 and they are entitled to 50 per cent of any future fee that the @entity24 side receive			1
in truth , it is a handsome return for a player who , sadly , never really belonged at @entity39 , written off within six months by sir @entity45 and shunned immediately by @entity46 and @entity47			0
certain things , however , should be made clear			0
first , that @entity5 , aged just 20 when he joined , does not deserve this notoriety			0
his story is , to an extent , an inspiring tale of a young boy who lived rough on the streets of @entity55 and came to play for one of the world ’s most famous football clubs			0
it is the stuff of @entity61 films , as @entity5 was plucked from the wilderness and handed a place at @entity64 do @entity65 , a charity - funded orphanage in @entity67			2
invisible : @entity5 never started a single @entity38 match despite signing for £ 7.5m in 2010 here was a player without even a @entity72 profile , earning just £ 12,000 a year with @entity24 third division club @entity73 , who had performed at the @entity76 and now , here he was , playing for @entity4			1
if we take away the gross misjudgement by @entity4 for a moment and assess this on a purely humane level , for @entity5 to be wearing the jersey of @entity4 was something quite remarkable , even if there was to be no fairy - tale ending in a red shirt			1
@entity5 ’s contribution to @entity4 is encapsulated in a three minute @entity89 clip called ‘ the @entity90 ’ , where a an appearance against @entity92 descended into ridicule as attempted cross after attempted cross flew straight into the stands			2
on that day , @entity5 , on as a substitute was himself substituted			0
distracted : sources at the club suggested @entity5 lost his focus due to attention from fans and media transfer : @entity33 paid £ 2.3m for @entity5 , and @entity4 will also get 50 per cent of any future fee 2010/11 : signs for £ 7.5m after being recommended by @entity106			1
plays 74 minutes of football			0
2011/12 : loaned to @entity108 , plays less than an hour of competitive football all season			2
2012/13 : loaned to @entity111 , makes 17 appearances ad scores one goal			2
2013/14 : loaned to @entity114 , plays 27 times and scores 13 times			0
2014/15 : sold to @entity33 for £ 2.3m sources at @entity39 noted that the fame disorientated @entity5 a touch and he was taken in by the bright lights of @entity121			1
his application in training , he later admitted himself , was not up to scratch although @entity4 coaches would also point out that his technical deficiencies meant he may already have been a lost cause			0
clearly , though , @entity4 saw something at some stage to convince them to pay the £ 7.4m buyout clause to release @entity5 from a 5 - year contract at @entity132 in the summer of 2010			1
united scouts had spotted him scoring goals in pre-season for his new side but it later emerged that @entity5 was available for just £ 125,000 five weeks earlier at his previous club @entity73			1
there has been much chin - wagging and conspiracy theories over the role of super-agent @entity142 in the deal but it was another @entity24 man , @entity106 , that convinced sir @entity45 and @entity147 to commit to the purchase , despite the @entity4 manager having never seen @entity5 play , either live or on the television			1
@entity106 , the highly valued assistant of @entity45 for several years , provided a glowing recommendation			0
new boy : @entity5 playing in the @entity153 for new team @entity33 against @entity154 on the weekend as it transpired , it was a reckless gamble by @entity4 but @entity5 has gone some way to repairing his reputation in @entity24			1
last season , he scored 13 goals for @entity114 in the @entity24 top - flight , an impressive return for a side that finished second from bottom			0
in @entity24 , the narrative of their post @entity76 post-mortem involved much consternation at the decision to overlook @entity5 in their squad for @entity171			2
in his homeland , at least , @entity5 is now taken seriously			0
it is a far cry from the days when @entity4 supporters at reserve games would sing , only half - in - jest : ‘ if @entity5 scores , we ’re on the pitch			2
’ @entity5 may afford himself a wry smile when he realises that he will be playing @entity180 football this season while @entity4 are not			2
@entity33 , the biggest club in @entity24 and regular challengers in @entity183 , are no small - fry outfit and for them to hand @entity5 a four - year contract , they clearly sense some of the potential that @entity106 identified now coming to fruition .			1
