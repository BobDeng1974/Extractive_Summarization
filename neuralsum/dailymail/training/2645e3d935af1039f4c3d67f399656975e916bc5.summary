the jurors in the town which is predominantly white were drawn from a pool of 80 people			1
lawyers for the killer also plan to claim witnesses were offered immunity from prosecution if they gave evidence in the trial			0
the prospect of @entity0 walking free - or even winning a re-trial - has stunned family and friends of @entity3 , 24 , and 25 year old @entity4			1
' we thought we had seen the last of this nasty piece of work and it just feels us with horror that he could get the conviction overturned , ' said a friend of the @entity3 family			2
devastated : ' we thought we had seen the last of this nasty piece of work and it just fills us with horror that he could get the conviction overturned , ' said a friend of the @entity3 family ' it is inconceivable that he will win the appeal			2
i do not think the family of either men will be able to stand it			0
' @entity3 , from @entity61 , and @entity4 , from @entity62 , had been drinking at a downtown bar in @entity8 when they decided to walk to their holiday home in the early hours of the morning			1
police believe they were drunk and ended up walking through a crime plagued area called @entity70 where they were confronted by @entity0 whose face was hidden by a bandana			2
the teenager had been released from jail hours just earlier for a shooting incident when he ordered the pair to hand over their wallets			0
he made them drop their trousers before shooting them dead			0
@entity0 later boasted to friends that he had " done " the pair and hid the bullet casings and .22 handgun used in the murder			2
best buddies : @entity3 ( right ) and @entity4 ( left ) became friends after meeting at university police in @entity92 launched massive hunt for the killer as they feared the negative publicity from the deaths of two holidaymakers would hurt the town 's main industry of tourism			1
there were no eye witnesses to the shooting , but @entity0 was seen in the vicinity of the murder hours before and lived on the estate where it took place			0
although bullets matching those that killed the @entity113 tourists were found at his home most of the case against @entity0 was circumstantial			1
the key evidence came from a former friend who told the court he was asked to dispose of the gun			0
@entity0 's lawyers plan to tell the @entity120 in @entity121 that the friend and others who gave evidence had been offered immunity from prosecution for crimes they committed if they gave evidence			1

@entity0 , now aged 19 , never spoke at his trial and has shown no remorse over the murders			1
at the end of the trial two friends of @entity3 and @entity145 , who met at university , lashed out at president @entity149 for failing to make any comment about their deaths			2
@entity152 and @entity153 said letters had been sent to mr @entity149 but did not get a reply			0
they said the deaths of their friends was not worthy of ' ten minutes of his time			0
