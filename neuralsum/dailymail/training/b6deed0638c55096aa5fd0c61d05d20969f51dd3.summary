by @entity0 people decide how trustworthy strangers are within the blink of an eye , psychologists have found , and it is all down to the shape of their face			1
we tend to judge someone with high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones to be more honest , while we are less likely to trust someone with a furrowed brow and sunken cheeks , researchers suggest			1
the findings give new weight to the principle that first impressions count			0
psychologists from @entity35 found that a section of the brain decides a person ’s trustworthiness even before we have consciously perceived who they are			1
the brain takes just 33 milliseconds - three hundredths of a second , or a tenth of a time it takes to blink - to decide whether someone is to be trusted			1
the study , published in the @entity49 , suggests that our brains are set up to be instantly wary of people we decided we should not trust			0
@entity52 , assistant professor at @entity35 ’s @entity53 , said : ‘ our findings suggest that the brain automatically responds to a face ’s trustworthiness before it is even consciously perceived			1
‘ the results are consistent with an extensive body of research suggesting that we form spontaneous judgments of other people that can be largely outside awareness			0
’ applying the findings to public figures , trusted individuals such as breakfast tv hosts @entity22 and @entity23 both have high cheekbones and eyebrows			1
some might not agree but @entity70 would be deemed trustworthy unlike disgraced former @entity72 president @entity71 , one of the most famous liars in history wife killer @entity76 's eyebrows give him away as untrustworthy - as do jailed judge @entity77 's conversely , murderer @entity76 , who denied killing his wife @entity78 but was found guilty last month , and disgraced judge @entity77 , who was jailed for lying about being the driver of a car caught speeding , have sunken cheeks and furrowed brows			1
the @entity84 research team presented a panel of ten volunteers with 300 computer generated faces , and asked them how trustworthy each was			2
those faces with high cheekbones , high eyebrows and a smile were perceived to be the most honest			2
the scientists also presented the panel with real pictures of strangers , and the same facial attributes were found to be deemed as trustworthy			2
in a second set of experiments , a new set of 37 volunteers were presented with the ‘ trustworthy ’ and ‘ untrustworthy ’ images for a split second , while their brain activity was monitored			2
@entity104 has trustworthy features , unlike @entity106 , who has faced court for numerous driving offences including driving while having suspended licence the images were then immediately replaced with a neutral picture so the brain could no longer process the previous image			0
the scientists found that a region of the brain called the amygdala , which is vital in social and emotional behaviour , activated within 33 milliseconds even when the images were flashed up just momentarily			1
faces with the high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones prompted activity in a different part of the amygdala than faces with furrowed brows and sunken cheeks			2
dr @entity52 said : ‘ the findings suggest that we can assess another person ’s trustworthiness from their face extremely rapidly and without conscious awareness , and that the amygdala plays an important role in this process			0
@entity138 's features make him a housewife 's favourite while former premier @entity142 @entity141 , who stood down over inaccurate evidence at a corruption inquiry , has sunken cheekbones ‘ one possibility is that faces that appear more untrustworthy and likely to inflict harm , or faces with stronger trustworthiness cues in general , are spontaneously tracked by the amygdala , so the amygdala could then quickly alter other brain processes and coordinate fast , appropriate responses to people --- approach or avoid			1
‘ this tracking would be especially pronounced for untrustworthy faces , who might inflict harm , which is consistent with what we found			0
’ ' there 's no question that the facial appearance does affect how people see them			0
all day long i deal with people who say they 're having cosmetic surgery to stay in the workplace longer because they 're told they look tired , they look angry			0
they look like they 're ready to retire when they 're not , ' dr @entity171 , a @entity172 - based cosmetic surgeon , told @entity176			0
' it 's a very quick impression … it 's more a general feel that they get , the facial impression does make a difference			0

@entity84 psychologists found people judge trustworthiness on features
brain takes just 33 milliseconds to decide whether someone is to be trusted
furrowed eyebrows and sunken cheekbones suggest someone is untrustworthy
using the formula , @entity22 and @entity70 could be perceived as honest because of their facial features
