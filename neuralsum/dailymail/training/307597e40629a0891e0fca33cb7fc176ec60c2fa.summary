@entity6 , 43 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was just 27 when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the summer after her first year at law school			1
the incurable condition , which causes the immune system to attack the body 's central nervous system , has seen her body deteriorate drastically , leaving her unable to walk and barely talk			2
she she says now wants to regain control of her life - by choosing when she will die			2
life after death : @entity6 , who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 16 years ago , wants to end her life so that she can donate her organs to those who need them ' i would rather i help give life to others while my organs are still viable , ' she told @entity28			1
' it is my reality			2
weaker muscles on my talking , everything			2
this ultimately brings reality home			0
' of her condition , she added : ' it is a lot of loss - loss with advanced @entity40 it 's a grieving process , because you are losing your independence gradually			0
' medical ethicists said while @entity6 's case is compelling , it is troubled by the fact she lives in @entity8 , which is still haunted by the case of dr @entity49			1
the doctor , who was branded ' @entity49 ' , was a euthanasia activist who claimed to have assisted in as many as 130 deaths			0
changed life : @entity6 , left with a friend , was 27 when she was diagnosed with @entity40 while at law school @entity1 struggle : @entity6 , pictured undergoing physical therapy , is unable to walk and struggles to talk in 1999 , he was arrested and tried for his role in a case of voluntary euthanasia and served eight years of a 10 - to - 25 - year sentence			1
' it think that it 's possible [ a law could change in @entity8 ] , but it 's something that in @entity8 in particular is going to be very controversial given our history with dr. @entity49 , ' @entity64 , a law professor at @entity65 , told @entity71			1
' her motivations seem to be very heartfelt			0
she wants to both control her own destiny and also to help other people , and i think that 's a very compelling story to tell			0
' physician - assisted suicide is only legal in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			0
medical ethicist dr. @entity84 told @entity28 that the case would be presented with problems			0
problematic : experts said it is unlikely assisted dying laws will change in @entity8 due to the history of ' dr @entity49 ' @entity49 ( pictured ) , who was jailed after helping in a patient 's suicide ' if we wait too long , she could n't donate , ' he said			1
if we do it too early , she 's not terminal , and that raises a whole other set of ethical issues			0
' he added that a law could also bring rise to more ethical questions in the future			2
' one of the new dimensions that we 'd have to consider is , would folks feel more coerced to go this route because there would be benefit for someone else ? ' @entity84 said			0
but while @entity6 said it is too late for her lungs , she hopes that being allowed to die when she chooses would provide her kidneys , liver , heart and other organs for those in need			1
' i 'd rather still be useful and help , rather than waste away and not be able to help , ' she said			0
' what will give me joy is to know i left a legacy of giving life to others			1

@entity6 was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 16 years ago and has seen her *quality* of life *dramatically* *decrease*

but experts said it will be a hard fight to *achieve* a change in the law
