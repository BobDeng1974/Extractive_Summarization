the @entity22 announced on tuesday that a 169,000 square mile part of @entity44 had been named in the @entity5 's honour			1
experts said the move by the @entity48 to mark the jubilee year was ' provocative ' and designed to strengthen @entity2 interests in the area			1
@entity52 , professor of geopolitics at @entity54 , told @entity55 it was ' a calculated move to reinforce @entity2 interests ' in the area			1
he told the newspaper : ' i think it ’s provocative and it ’s significant because place - naming is one of the most powerful ways of reinforcing your sense of ownership of a territory , and the use of royalty is , in turn , the most powerful way of cementing a connection with the @entity2			1
' it is the latest in a ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries that has coincided with the 30th anniversary of the @entity78			0
earlier this year , @entity16 residents announced plans for a referendum in 2013 in an attempt to fend off @entity7 claims to the territory			2

he told assembled staff : ' as a mark of this country 's gratitude to the @entity5 for her service , we are naming a part of the @entity44 in her honour as @entity12			1
' this is a fitting tribute at the end of @entity99 's @entity19 year , and i am very proud to be able to announce it as she visits the @entity22			2

to be able to recognise the @entity2 's commitment to @entity4 with a permanent association with her majesty is a great honour			1
' he added the piece of land was previously unnamed			2
@entity12 is a barren , landlocked ice and snow - covered area uninhabited by people and virtually devoid of animal life			2
it is ice - cream cone shaped with its tip close to the @entity129 and it lies a few hundred miles from the coast where seals , emperor penguins and birdlife such as albatrosses are found			0
the @entity5 has been on the throne for 60 of the 104 years since the @entity2 claimed territory in @entity4 in 1908			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity35 , responsible for the @entity2 's scientific activities on the continent , said : ' it 's very high altitude so would be a great deal colder than the coast so you would n't get penguins , it 's very mountainous and cold			1
' at the moment it 's the summer season there which runs from october to march so it would be minus @entity148 and minus @entity149 at the @entity129			0
' in the winter time it can get to minus @entity151 and minus @entity152 but most of the life is found around the coastline			0
' earlier , the @entity5 visited @entity156 where she attended a @entity87 meeting for the first time			0
earlier in the day the @entity5 met @entity87 - becoming the first peace - time monarch to do so for 231 years			0
