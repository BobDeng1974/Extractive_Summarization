by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 10:17 est , 24 june 2013 gobble a banana while riding the escalator , pause for a coffee in between outlets , have a quick power nap in a changing cubicle ... everyone has their own way of staying in high spirits and bountiful energy while doing that most exhausting of activities : shopping			0
but perhaps what you really need to be doing is long - term training on the specific muscles you use while lugging bags and boxes up and down the high - street and repeatedly lifting dresses up and over your head			2
the @entity25 's workout will strengthen the core muscles you use while on a shopping trip , making it easier for you to lug bags up escalators and run for the bus while laden with groceries a @entity34 gym has created a retail - inspired work - out for the shopaholic in us all , a 30 - minute routine packed with lunges , planks , squats and @entity43 twists , each promising to tighten and strengthen your ' shopping muscles '			1
the shopping work - out begins with a 10 - minute warm - up walk on the treadmill - the equivalent of waking to the bus stop			1
the speed then cranks up for 10 minutes on the stepper ( imagine you 're running up the escalators to beat the sales rush )			0
you then launch into three sets of 20 lunges while holding a set of dumbbells : just imagine picking dropped t - shirts off the floor while holding a screaming child over your shoulders			2
after a few months of the shopper 's workout you 'll be able to strut confidently down @entity66 half - naked like these chaps , the glamorous @entity68 drop into the plank and hold yourself there for one minute , recreating the scene in which you 're lying on the changing room floor struggling to squeeze yourself into a pair of skinny jeans			2
now it 's time for squats			0
hold a barbell over your shoulders to make more difficult and drop into 12 repetitions , for three sets			0
envisage yourself reaching for shoes on the low shelf			0
then throw yourself into 30 seconds of @entity43 twists - the same movement you do while pulling on jeggings - followed by three sets of 12 kettlebell sumo squats , to strengthen your bag - carrying arm muscles			1
exhaustion such as this will be a thing of the past once you 've perfected the work - out and trained your muscles to carry heavy bags with ease and take escalator steps two at a time at last it 's time for a round of @entity101 crunches to strengthen your running - for - the - bus core , and then a 10 - minute cool down on the cross-trainer , the equivalent of the long , awkward trudge home with your shopping bags			1
the retail - routine has been created by @entity108 , the new premium - budget gym from @entity111 founder @entity110 , to celebrate the launch of its new @entity66 flagship , where membership costs Â£ 19.99 per month			1
@entity115 , ceo of @entity108 said : ' @entity116 is our most ambitious project ever , offering fantastic facilities at a fraction of the price of the big boys			0
we hope our new shopper 's work out will give shoppers a leg up too			0
