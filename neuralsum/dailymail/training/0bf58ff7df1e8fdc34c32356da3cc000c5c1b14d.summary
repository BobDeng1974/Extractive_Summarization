you could n't really blame him for taking a curtain call			0
@entity3 of @entity4 might have been queen of @entity6 but yesterday – for the moment at least – @entity8 was king			1
having roared to victory in straight sets against @entity12 @entity11 , he performed an extravagant bow towards @entity14 and @entity15 in the royal box			1
never mind the royal wave ... @entity14 , @entity14 looks expectantly over at her husband as she raises her arms for the @entity21 wave on @entity6 here 's the @entity21 one : the second in line to the throne gets in to the spirit of the occasion your majesty : @entity31 number one @entity8 bows to the @entity32 and @entity14 following his victory over @entity11 in their fourth round match at @entity36 in turn , they gave him their seal of approval with a pat on the back after the match , won in 32c ( 100f ) heat on court , and told him : ' well done			1
' @entity8 said : ' if i 'd known they were coming , i would have shaved			1
i was thinking to myself as i came off i was sweaty and very hairy			0
i said to them , " i 'm sorry , i 'm a bit sweaty "			0
but it was very nice to get to meet them			0
' the bow , he said , was ' just , yeah , sort of off the cuff			0
did n't think too much about it '			0
he added : ' i was obviously very happy after the match			0
i think it was the right thing to do			0
' the win earns @entity8 a quarter - final clash tomorrow with the @entity63 @entity62			1
happy couple : the @entity32 and @entity14 sitting in the royal box on @entity6 at @entity36 pretty layering : @entity14 followed @entity36 's specification that players must wear white @entity15 and @entity14 became the surprise stars of the royal box after weeks of speculation that they might attend before embarking on their tour of @entity75 tomorrow			1
@entity6 was crammed to capacity , which equates to 15,000 bums on seats			0
but to widespread disappointment , none , alas , was @entity81 's			2
for although there were frantic rumours during the morning that @entity14 's little sister and former maid of honour would arrive with the royal party , @entity81 - watch was stood down at 12.31pm when the celebrated rear failed to emerge from the police - escorted cavalcade			1
@entity14 , a huge fan of the game , wore what looked to be a triple - decker tennis skirt – in fact a £ 795 @entity94 dress – teamed with @entity97 nude court shoes			1
within half an hour of her appearance , the frock , reduced to £ 395 in the summer sale , had sold out on the designer 's website			1
unusual detailing : the white disks on @entity14 's shoulders will remind @entity36 fans of a less successful recent fashion statement ... @entity109 ' @entity108 jacket which was covered in white tennis balls the royal spectators clapped and cheered as @entity8 got to grips with the heat			1
later , during @entity114 's match , they would even join in a @entity21 wave			2
@entity8 's triumph was followed by despair from the @entity119 sisters who made a shock exit from the tournament in the fourth round			1
@entity119 ' attempt to win a sixth @entity36 title ended in the fourth round with a 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 loss to @entity127 of @entity128			1
the 23 - year - old @entity127 beat @entity119 at @entity36 last year by the same score to reach her first @entity131 semi-final			1
she also won their first - round match at the @entity134 in 2006			2
@entity119 ' defeat came shortly after younger sister @entity136 also went out in the fourth round , losing to @entity137			1
it is the first time since 2006 that neither sister has reached the @entity36 quarter - finals			0
expert in action : @entity8 drew in an a-list crowd for his match on @entity6 today fan club : @entity8 's girlfriend @entity146 and his mother , @entity147 , were watching his progress support from afar : @entity8 's tennis racket bag is covered with tweets from his fans @entity14 and @entity15 appeared happy and relaxed as they watched the day 's tennis			1
@entity3 has been a @entity36 fan for years - as have all the @entity154			1
@entity81 has attended the @entity155 and the @entity156 since her big sister 's wedding earlier this year and @entity14 has visited the championships twice before			2
in 2007 she attended with a friend to watch @entity114 play @entity162 @entity161 on @entity163 and in 2008 she visited again			2
a polite thank you letter @entity14 wrote to @entity36 bosses after her most recent visit is currently on display at the @entity169			0
@entity171 spectator : this is @entity14 's third time at @entity36 and her passion for tennis was clear to see from her facial expressions fun day out : @entity15 and @entity14 's visit to @entity177 is a private affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties more than 2,000 people queued along the grassy banks outside the club in a bid to secure places for @entity8 's match			1
as the fans waited outside , though , the @entity32 and @entity14 took up their prime positions on @entity6			0
there they watched a very convincing display by @entity31 's number one who won the first set in a tie - break , soon claimed the second too and broke early in the third set			2
as well as the young royals , @entity8 had his more personal fan club in attendance			2
his pretty girlfriend @entity199 and his mother @entity200 were sitting side - by - side at his fourth round match			1
@entity8 's support also came from further afield , his tennis racket bag was covered with tweets from his legion of fans including ' stay positive we are all behind you ' and ' believe in yourself and never give up '			1
the perfect guest : @entity14 chatted and joked with @entity211 , the wife of the chairman of the @entity213 , who was sitting by her side top tips : @entity14 leant back to give @entity216 , @entity217 's mother , who was sitting behind her , a kiss on the cheek before exchanging a few words with her too @entity14 and @entity15 's visit to @entity177 is a private affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties			2
but they both appeared very contented to chat to the others sitting around them			0
@entity14 looked as composed as we have come to expect from the unflappable duchess			0
she chatted and joked with @entity211 , the wife of the chairman of the @entity213 , who was sitting by her side			0
the relaxed tennis fan also leant back to give @entity216 , the mother of our last big @entity31 hopeful @entity230 , who was sitting behind her , a kiss on the cheek before exchanging a few words with her too			0
as the royal box guests arrived , thousands of sun - drenched fans applauded			0
but the heartiest welcome was reserved for the young couple who were given a standing ovation			0
the retractable roof was also partially pulled over to shade the royals ' end of the arena			0
other wimbledon - goers were not quite as lucky , they used umbrellas to shade themselves from the sweltering sun as they sat on other courts or watched the action on @entity250			0
sizzling : fans queuing to enter the grounds at @entity36 struggle with the heat , with one man needing to lie down and another woman using an umbrella to shelter from the sun soaking up the rays : with a large bottle of water by her side , this woman lies on the tarmac and covers her forehead outside @entity36 defeat : @entity136 survived three match points , but ultimately crashed out against @entity137 in the tournament 's first big upset			2

royal couple were there to watch @entity8 beat @entity11
@entity3 was wearing @entity94 's £ 395 @entity274 dress which is on sale
