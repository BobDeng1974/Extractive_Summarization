at risk : the government 's £ 50billion high - speed rail project has been given an ' amber - red ' warning - meaning it is at serious risk of failure			1
above , the @entity9 line will run from @entity11 to @entity12 , and then on to the @entity13 the alarming assessment by the watchdog @entity29 ( @entity29 ) appeared in its second annual report published by the @entity31			1
the report covers 199 projects across @entity35 departments - totalling what ministers admit is an ‘ eye - watering ’ £ 400billion of taxpayers ’ money over their lifetimes			1
it rates the projects on a five tier traffic light system from red for ‘ unachievable ’ to ‘ green ’ for success being ‘ highly likely			0
’ the delivery of two queen elizabeth - class aircraft carriers was rated as ' red ' for a second year in a row , while the controversial @entity51 scheme was excluded from the review after it was ' reset ' by @entity54 @entity53			2
@entity9 's ' amber - red ' rating follows an earlier row over the government ’s refusal to publish documents relating to an earlier damning assessment on the scheme			1

above , a protest sign is pictured in @entity76 , @entity77 the @entity78 is currently taking legal action to force the disclosure of those documents			0
the new @entity29 assessment - covering the period from july to september last year - was welcomed by opponents of @entity9 , who have condemned the project as a ‘ white elephant ’ and an expensive ‘ vanity project			1
’ but they also criticised the timing of the report ’s release – the day after the local government and @entity94 elections as votes were still being counted – as ‘ a good day to bury bad news ’ and another example of @entity58 ‘ spin ’			0
in the foreword to the report , @entity99 said the government must identify and address problems early on before they become an issue the ' amber - red ' grading , the second worst of the five possible levels , means : ’ successful delivery of the project is in doubt , with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas			1
urgent action is needed to ensure these are addressed , and whether resolution is feasible			2
’ the @entity29 report states : ‘ the amber / red delivery confidence assessment on @entity9 , like other projects with a similar assessment , indicates that the focused attention that is being applied to addressing the remaining issues must continue			1
’ it adds : ‘ @entity125 ( @entity9 ) is a high - profile example of a project that displays many of these challenges			1
it is not unusual for projects of this scale to have a lower delivery confidence assessment early in their project life , highlighting the substantial issues that inevitably remain to be resolved			0
‘ significant progress has been made in the last year on @entity9 , for example in depositing the @entity136 in @entity137 and securing successful second reading in the @entity139			2
’ but @entity140 who chairs campaign group @entity9 said : ‘ the @entity29 have kept giving @entity9 amber / red ratings			1
@entity142 may claim that it is a project in excellent shape , but the evidence says otherwise			0
’ and @entity146 of @entity147 said : ‘ it ’s no surprise the report concludes @entity9 is at risk of failure			2
this project is running out of control			0
’ the @entity154 for @entity9 recently survived its second reading - despite fury and a backbench rebellion by dozens of @entity159 backbenchers			2
but a @entity142 spokesman said : ‘ as the @entity29 itself makes clear , @entity9 has made significant progress in the eight months since the evidence for this report was gathered , most recently with mps voting 452 to 41 in favour of the @entity167 of the hybrid @entity154			1

protest : the new @entity29 assessment - covering the period from july to september last year - was welcomed by opponents of @entity9 , who have condemned the project as a ' white elephant ' and an expensive ' vanity project ' ' @entity9 is a vital part of the government ’s long term economic plan and we are determined to ensure @entity183 will benefit from the jobs , skills and extra capacity it will provide			1
’ in the foreword to the @entity29 report , cabinet office secretary @entity99 admits the budgets are ‘ eyewatering ’ , but insists : ’ delivering projects will never be easy – they are some of the biggest and most complex things the government will do			2
' but we must not pretend problems do n’t exist			0
instead , we must identify and address them early on before they become an issue			0

’ speaking out : chief secretary to the treasury , @entity197 , said the @entity198 ' remains committed to the important work that this government is undertaking to improve the delivery of our most important projects ' the report 's publication comes as campaigners have been fighting for months to have details of earlier internal correspondence between ministers and @entity214 made public			1
in april , @entity183 ’s freedom of information tsar announced he was to launch an ‘ unprecedented ’ @entity218 challenge against the government after ministers used a wartime veto to censor embarrassing details about the controversial @entity9 high speed rail project			2
information commissioner @entity223 said he was seeking a judicial review of transport secretary @entity226 ’s decision to block publication of secret internal report highlighting official fears that the proposed £ 50billion project could fail – saying such censorship was ‘ unlawful ’			0
the government 's controversial @entity51 scheme was excluded from the @entity29 report after it was ' reset ' by @entity53 mr @entity223 said he had ' not taken the decision lightly ’ , but that a fundamental point of principle is at stake			2
he added that ministers have acted unfairly and unreasonably in banning publication , despite there being ‘ no demonstrable flaw in fact or law			0
’ the furious confrontation began in january when transport secretary mr @entity226 invoked rare emergency veto powers to ban publication of a damning @entity249 into the government ’s controversial @entity9 high speed rail			1
the banned report is also believed to have put an ‘ amber - red ’ rating on the scheme , suggesting it was in danger of failing			1
six months earlier , the information commissioner had already ruled that the government had to disclose the controversial @entity9 report			2
but the government refused to comply			0
and after first appealing against the decision			0
ministers subsequently withdrew their appeal and in january , imposed a blanket veto of the kind issued in wartime			0
ministers argued the report into the y - shaped line from @entity11 to @entity12 and beyond to the @entity13 , was private and confidential advice from civil servants to them , so should n’t be published			1

new figures revealed last week that taxpayer spending on consultants for the controversial high speed @entity9 project is accelerating 86per cent and £ 87million over budget			1
expert analysis of the @entity284 ’s spending to the end of february 2014 by construction magazine building reveals that the @entity35 - run firm set up to manage the @entity288 - has overshot its allocated £ 101m budget by £ 87million for four lots of professional services contracts			2
that takes total spending on consultants to £ 188m – or 86per cent over budget			0
preparatory work on @entity9 is set to start in 2016 , ahead of building work in 2017			0
the first phase from @entity297 to @entity12 will be completed by 2026 , with an ‘ accelerated ’ section to @entity299 finished the following year			0
the full route to @entity301 and @entity302 is expected to be completed by 2030 .			0
