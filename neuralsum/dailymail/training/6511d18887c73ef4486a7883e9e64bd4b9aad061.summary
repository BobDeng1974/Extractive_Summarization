by @entity0 , royal correspondent in @entity1 ' inevitable ' : sir @entity2 said @entity3 had been moving to renounce the @entity4 ' for a long time ' just hours before the arrival of the @entity6 and @entity7 and @entity8 , a leading @entity3 politician has warned it is ‘ inevitable ’ the country will become a republic			1
former deputy prime minister sir @entity2 , who was also secretary general of the @entity13 for eight years , said the country had been moving to renounce the @entity4 ‘ for a long time ’			1
‘ there are 54 countries in the @entity13 , only 16 are realms [ where the @entity17 is head of state ] , and i can tell you now that one @entity19 publicly , and three @entity19 privately , are probably going to give up the relationship with the monarchy when the @entity17 dies , ’ he said			2
‘ so it is a diminishing group of countries and the important thing is for us to openly and candidly debate the issue			2
’ asked when @entity3 might go down the same road , sir @entity2 added : ‘ i do n’t know when … [ but ] i think it is inevitable			1
i ’m quite certain the royal family understands that completely			2
’ prince @entity32 , wife @entity7 and their son , @entity8 , were today on a flight heading @entity35 to begin a landmark three week tour of both @entity3 and @entity38 , another country where the republican cause is strong			1
tickets cost around £ 6,300 return			2
the plane is due to land in @entity58 early tomorrow morning , allowing the royal party to transfer to a @entity3 @entity61 jet which will transport them for the first leg of their tour			2
the bill for all flights associated with the tour is being met by local taxpayers			2
while the trip has prompted huge excitement on the other side of the world – with 450 members of the media accredited to cover it - it has not been without the odd hiccup			0
first there was a diplomatic falling out with the @entity80 who angrily rejected a meeting with the couple when he discovered they could only spare him 90 minutes out of their busy schedule			0
@entity86 accused government officials of treating him like a ‘ carnival act ’			0
now a row has erupted over a £ 260 child car seat fitted in @entity8 ’s official car , according to the @entity92			1
pricey trip : the @entity46 understands that the @entity4 are were travelling @entity47 on a @entity53 flight via @entity54 ( file picture )			1
tickets cost around £ 6,300 return the @entity98 safety seat was installed by @entity99 , a charity which provides services and support to parents and young children			0
the organisation has organised a meet and greet with other babies of a similar age for @entity8 at @entity108 in @entity1 on wednesday			1
at @entity32 and @entity7 ’s specific request , the charity last week installed the child seat facing outwards in the royal limo			1
in the @entity112 that would be perfectly acceptable as government guidelines state that babies and infants only need to be carried in rear - facing seats until they can sit up unaided – something eight - month - old @entity8 is now able to do - and have exceeded the maximum weight for the seat			1
but in @entity3 , @entity99 , which is a hugely influential group , is very vocal about its own guidelines which recommend children remain in rear - facing car seats until the age of two			0
rear facing seats significantly reduce the risk of death or injury , protecting the baby ’s head , neck and spine			2
key event : the @entity6 and @entity7 with their son @entity133 at his christening last october it even proudly issued photographs of its services technician @entity139 fitting @entity8 ’s car seat and saying : ‘ if it ca n’t be installed correctly we need to work out a way we can make it correct			1
we need to make sure the baby is safe			0
’ response to the photograph was immediate with hundreds of parents going online to complain about double standards			0
@entity150 said on the @entity152 page : ‘ they [ @entity32 and @entity7 ] have made an irresponsible decision about facing their baby forwards in the car			1
‘ @entity158 added : ‘ you went against everything you recommended , undoing all your hard work regarding rear facing until two			0
’ last night , however , the society was unapologetic			0
chief executive @entity164 said @entity99 's role was ‘ to provide advice and work in partnership with parents ’ to make informed decisions that worked best for them			0
‘ proud parents : the @entity6 and @entity7 leave the @entity173 of @entity174 in @entity175 , with their newborn son in july of last year he added : ‘ @entity99 's priority is to ensure car seats are installed by qualified car seat technicians to ensure they perform correctly			1
while @entity99 recommend that children stay in rear - facing seats until age two , it is not a legal requirement			0
’ the latest action - packed tour reflects the ‘ outdoorsy and sporty ’ people that @entity32 and @entity7 are			1
there is an eclectic mix of events including a trek around @entity192 ( @entity192 ) , a fast - boat river ride and meeting some of the @entity195 champions			0
the couple will also participate in a boat race - on opposing teams			0
they will also meet sir @entity200 , maker of the @entity202 and @entity204 trilogies			2
but the visit also includes more formal events with politicians and military personnel - though there are no black tie occasions			0
and no royal tour would be complete without the ceremonial planting of a tree			0
@entity7 will also visit children 's hospices in each country - continuing her charitable interest in palliative care for youngsters			1
in @entity3 the royals will visit @entity1 , @entity221 and @entity222 among other places			0
@entity38 highlights include @entity58 , @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 - but not @entity228 or @entity229			0
the royal couple will arrive at @entity231 in the early hours of tomorrow before receiving a formal welcome from the governor general of @entity3 @entity234 at @entity108 in the capital @entity1			0
@entity236 , @entity7 's private secretary , mr @entity237 , three press officers , a tour secretary , an orderly and adviser sir @entity240 will be part of the royal party during the tour			1
the royal entourage will also include a hairdresser and a personal assistant			0
@entity99 spokesman @entity248 said he had spoken to @entity249 , and stressed that the seat was installed ‘ in line with the parents ' preferences ’			0
although the three week trip , undertaken on behalf of the @entity17 , has been more than a year in the planning , it has very much been designed with baby @entity8 in mind , according to aides			1
and instead of hawking themselves from city to city , as is customary on overseas royal visits , @entity32 and @entity7 will base their young son in three different ‘ hubs ’ : @entity1 , @entity58 and @entity227			1
the arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see @entity8 almost every night – bar a stop - over in @entity268 , @entity3 , and another at @entity192 in @entity38			1
‘ it ’s a long way to go and [ would mean ] a long time away from their son , ’ the couple ’s private secretary , @entity237 , said earlier this month			2
‘ the tour has been designed with @entity8 ’s consideration and comfort in mind			1
‘ taking a nine month old on a royal tour is not a first , but it has not happened in this @entity4 ’s context for many , many years so there has been much to think about – as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise			1
’ royal aides have warned that @entity8 ’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no - one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11 - hour time difference			1
sources have told the @entity46 that the little prince is also teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability			2
but he is , generally , a happy little boy say friends of the couple , who is adept to taking everything in his stride – including , hopefully , the large crowds waiting for their first glimpse of the future king			0
@entity32 's last official trip to @entity3 and @entity38 was in march 2011 , when he visited @entity222 , shortly after it suffered an earthquake , and the @entity38 states of @entity306 and @entity307 , which had been hit by floods			2
in january 2010 he represented the @entity17 at the opening of the @entity311 building in @entity1 and also visited @entity221 , and during the same trip travelled to @entity228 and @entity58 .			0
