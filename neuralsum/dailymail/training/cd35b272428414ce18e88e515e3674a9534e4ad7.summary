by @entity0 published : 12:14 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 23 july 2013 astronauts aboard the @entity2 have taken a photograph of gravity waves - an atmospheric phenomenon that is impossible to see from @entity6			1
the image makes the clouds look as if they are rippling , an occurrence known as gravity waves , which shows the effect of gravity on the earth 's weather system			1
these particular gravity waves were over @entity16 , one of the great lakes of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and to the southwest of @entity23			1
astronauts aboard the the @entity2 have taken a photograph of gravity waves - an atmospheric phenomenon that can not be seen from @entity6			1
the clouds look as if they are rippling			0
the image was taken with a @entity30 digital camera by members of the @entity33 crew several distinct sets of parallel cloud bands are visible in the photograph			0
gravity waves are produced when moisture - laden air encounters imbalances in air density , such as when cool air flows over warmer air			1
this can make the flowing air oscillate up and down as it moves , which in turn causes clouds to condense as the air rises			2
they then cool and evaporate away as the air sinks and warms , which produces the distinctive parallel bands of clouds			0
@entity54 said the orientation of the cloud bands in this image suggests that air flowing off of the land surfaces to the north is interacting with moist , stable air over the lake surface , creating gravity waves			1
gravity waves were spotted over @entity16			2
@entity54 said the orientation of the cloud bands suggests that air flowing off of the land surfaces to the north is interacting with moist , stable air over the lake surface , creating the clouds			1
@entity71 - caused by light reflection off a water surface - can also be seen near @entity74 the photograph was taken on 24 june with a @entity30 digital camera by members of the @entity33 crew , and was then enhanced by experts on @entity6 to improve the contrast and remove lens artifacts			0
it is also possible to see another phenomenon in the image , known as sunglint			0
@entity71 is caused by light reflection off a water surface			0
some of the reflected light travels directly back towards the observer , resulting in a bright mirror - like appearance over large expanses of water			0
water currents and changes in surface tension , typically caused by presence of oils or surfactants , alter the reflective properties of the water and can be highlighted by sunglint			0
in this image , surface water currents are visible to the east of @entity74 that are oriented similarly to the gravity waves , suggesting that they too are the product of winds moving off of the land surface .			2

the photograph was taken from the @entity2 and shows gravity waves over @entity16 and @entity20
gravity waves are produced when moisture - laden air encounters imbalances in air density and causes flowing air to move up and down
@entity54 said the distinctive clouds were probably formed by air flowing off of the land surfaces with air over the lake surface
