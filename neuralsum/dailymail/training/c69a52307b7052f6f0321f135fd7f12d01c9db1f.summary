a 33 - stone man who was so depressed about being overweight that he tried to end his own life has lost a staggering 18 stone - and so dramatic is his transformation that he is now nicknamed mr @entity4			1
@entity5 , 31 , has also found a beautiful blonde girlfriend , @entity6 , who he has been dating for about a year and a half			1
interestingly , @entity5 says : ' what attracted me to her at the start is that she mentioned she hates people who judge others based on their appearance			1
speaking to @entity31 says that his diet was never excessive			0
' i live at home and i 'd generally have cereal for breakfast , a sandwich for lunch and then whatever my mum cooked for dinner			2
' the weight gain came from the alcohol			2
i would drink an entire bottle of whisky and about six cans of lager every night			0
' if i ran out of whisky i could drink up to 18 cans of lager , so i was consuming about 3,000 calories in alcohol every day			1
@entity5 weighed 22 stone by the age of 21 and by the time he was 29 he tipped the scales at 33 stone			1
morbidly obese @entity5 became so down about his weight that he took an overdose to end his suffering			1
but surviving the suicide attempt proved to be a turning point for @entity5 , from @entity21 , who has since lost over half his bodyweight			1
before and after : left , @entity5 was once asked to leave a bar by a group of girls who cruelly told him he was making them ' feel sick '			1
right , @entity5 is now fighting fit and says he 's been given a ' new lease of life ' incredible progress : @entity5 charted his weight loss and subsequent muscle gain on @entity71 - but says he is still insecure about loose skin around his hips ' that was the last time i went out in public , apart from going to the doctor , for seven years			1
' now a personal trainer and nicknamed mr muscles , @entity5 , 31 , is urging others not to get into the same situation he found himself in			1
he said : ' by the age of 21 , i weighed 22 stone			1
i used to go out but , one night , a girl came up to me and asked me to leave the bar i was in			0
i asked why and she told me i was making her and her friends feel sick			0
' i 'd also end up eating sandwiches or about four slices of white bread late at night as the drinking made me hungry			2
' though @entity5 previously had several jobs including car valeting and as a supermarket security guard his increasing weight soon meant he was unable to work and he became increasingly isolated			1
he said : ' one night , while listening to @entity95 , i thought to myself , " what kind of a life is this ? " ' i had terrible pains but i was too scared to go to the gym and do anything about my weight , as people pointed and laughed at me in the street			2
' i thought , " stuff it " , and drank two bottles of whisky , eight cans of @entity107 and as many tablets as i could find			0
' i remember waking up , no headache , no pains , just a sickening feeling that i was still here and not dead			0
' then , one night , reality set in for @entity5 and he decided it was time to take control of his life			1
' i had wasted everything and lost everything and the only person who could do something about it was me , ' he said			2
@entity5 , now 13 stone with a muscular physique , initially lost weight using just a cross-trainer in his room @entity5 ordered a cross-trainer on the internet , set it up in his room and set to work			1
he gradually built up his stamina to three one - hour sessions a day and stopped drinking altogether			1
@entity5 said : ' every session on the cross-trainer ended up with me taking my xxxxl dripping wet t - shirt off and just looking down at my belly crying			1
but , each time , i picked myself up and carried on			0
' it took 18 months for @entity5 , now 31 , to lose 18 stone			1
but he was still left with a major problem – his loose skin			0
' i felt just as disgusting as i did when i weighed 33 stone			2
i needed to do something , and i ended up paying for skin on my stomach and upper arms to be removed			0
' the operation removed some of the excess skin but @entity5 was not satisfied with the end result			2
it is little wonder that @entity5 has now earned the nickname mr muscles @entity5 decided to join a gym to tone up properly - and enjoyed working out so much he strove to make it his career			1
demonstrating his new found body confidence @entity5 has shared his progress on his @entity71 page , posting a series of pictures of himself throughout his dramatic weight loss alongside the caption ‘ trained my f * * * * * * ass off ! ’			1
in response to the highly complimentary comments @entity5 says that he feels he still has some way to go in honing his physique			2
‘ well done does n't seem to cut it			0
one hell of an accomplishment , ’ one message read			0
@entity5 responded : ‘ thanks everyone , really appreciate the kind words			2
‘ have a long way to go yet , got ta ( sic ) pack on more muscle to fill that skin			0
just gon na ( sic ) take time and effort			0
need my head in the right place to finish the fight			0
’ @entity5 also has posted images of his new healthy lifestyle with pictures of high - protein snacks and bread as well as himself hard at work in the gym			1
' i try and consume about 250g of protein a day now and eat only what you would describe as clean food , ' @entity5 told @entity197			2
' i do treat myself to the occasional take away and a couple of beers at the weekends but i never get drunk anymore			0
despite his amazing transformation , @entity5 admits he still has insecurities			2
he says : ' my loose skin still really affects me , especially around my hips			0
it makes me very nervous and paranoid			0
' when i run and jump i can feel moving and it feels likes flab to me			0
' i always feel people are staring at it			0
' i think i look better with my clothes on as then you ca n't see the skin , though people say they do n’t notice it			0
' i do get disappointed i ca n’t be like everyone who trains as hard as me , but you just have to get on with it			0
' now @entity5 , who says he is still getting used to his new body shape , has qualified as a personal trainer and is looking for his first clients			1
' losing weight has not only given me a new lease of life , it has actually given me a life , ' he said .			0
