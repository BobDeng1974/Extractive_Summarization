by @entity0 published : 08:13 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 08:53 est , 29 march 2013 move over rats and squirrels , an increasing numbers of big cats and wildlife are giving up their natural habitat to come and live in the sprawling cities			0
a new study led by @entity10 scientist @entity9 finds that certain landscapes of western @entity12 completely devoid of wilderness and with high human populations are crawling with a different kind of backyard wildlife : leopards			1
the study found as many as five adult large carnivores , including leopards and striped hyenas , per 100 square kilometres , a density never before reported in a human - dominated landscape			1
spot on : leopards are loving the urban environment , forsaking the tough life in the jungle the study , called @entity29 in our backyards , appeared in the march 6 edition of the journal @entity34			2
using camera traps , the authors founds that leopards often ranged close to houses at night though remained largely undetected by the public			0
despite this close proximity between leopards and people , there are few instances of attacks in this region			2
neighbourhood threat : there is increasing awareness about the ability of some large predators like wolves and pumas to live in cities the authors also photographed rusty spotted cat , small @entity12 civet , @entity12 fox , jungle cat , jackal , mongoose – and a variety of people from the local communities			1
the research took place in western @entity67 , @entity12			0
‘ human attacks by leopards were rare despite a potentially volatile situation considering that the leopard has been involved in serious conflict , including human deaths in adjoining areas , ’ said big cat expert @entity68 of @entity10			1
snake attack : the @entity12 variety of mongoose is well known for its ability to fight and kill venomous snakes , particularly cobras ‘ the results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both humans and wildlife to each other 's presence			1
’ the authors say that the findings show that conservationists must look outside of protected areas for a more holistic approach to safeguarding wildlife in a variety of landscapes			0
the study was located in the @entity103 district of western @entity67 , @entity12			0
according to @entity105 big cat expert @entity68 : ‘ the results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both humans and wildlife to each other ’s presence			2
’ having its day : @entity111 is an opportunistic omnivore , a predator of small - to medium - sized animals and they are proficient scavengers the findings also suggest that conservationists must look outside of protected areas for a more holistic approach to studying wildlife and their expanding habitats			0
during the last twenty years , there has been an increasing awareness of the ability of some large predators like wolves and pumas to live in very human - dominated environments in the developed world			1
most examples of large carnivores in urban landscapes are from countries with a low human population density although in the case of mountain lions in @entity137 , it has been seen that part of their home ranges overlap with densely populated urban landscapes			1
recent results from @entity144 show comparable densities for lions , cheetahs and jackals inside and outside the protected areas , although the human population density there was low			0
very little is known about the ecology of ‘ urban ’ carnivores in densely populated countries where the potential for conflict can be very high			0
for instance , @entity12 has a high diversity of large carnivores , many of which share spaces with one of the highest human and livestock populations in the world			1
the most common is the leopard , which is frequently reported from many human dominated landscapes across @entity12 where it is involved in a wide range of conflict situations , often with fatal outcomes for humans .			2

as many as five adult large carnivores , including leopards and striped hyenas , per 100 square kilometres in a human - dominated landscape .
attacks by leopards on humans rare , despite proximity
other wildlife living in urban environments include small @entity12 civet , @entity12 fox , jungle cat , jackal and mongoose
