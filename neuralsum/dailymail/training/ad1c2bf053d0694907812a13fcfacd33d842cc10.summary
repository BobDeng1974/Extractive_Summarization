the world ’s first test - tube burger will be served in @entity2 next week			1
it is made from meat grown in a laboratory , rather than cattle raised in pastures			1
and its developers hope it will show how the soaring global demand for protein can be met without the need for vast herds of cattle			0
the 5oz ‘ @entity19 ’ , which cost £ 250,000 to produce , is made from 3,000 tiny strips of meat grown from the stem cells of a cow			1
the raw meat is said to be grey with a slippery texture similar to squid or scallop			2
world first : one lucky person will be able to try the first test tube burger , but it cost £ 250,000 it has been created by professor @entity31 , from the @entity32 in @entity33			1
his research has been funded by an anonymous businessman – who may be the first to try the burger			2
he told @entity38 on sunday : ' right now , we are using 70 per cent of all our agricultural capacity to grow meat through livestock			2
you are going to need alternatives			0
if we do n’t do anything meat will become a luxury food and will become very expensive			2
’ a four - step technique is used to turn stem cells from animal flesh into a burger			1
first , the stem cells are stripped from the cow ’s muscle			1
next , they are incubated in a nutrient broth until they multiply many times over , creating a sticky tissue with the consistency of an undercooked egg			0
this ‘ wasted muscle ’ is then bulked up through the laboratory equivalent of exercise - it is anchored to @entity64 and stretched			0
finally , 3,000 strips of the lab - grown meat are minced , and , along with 200 pieces of lab - grown animal fat , formed into a burger			1
the process is still lengthy , as well as expensive , but it could take just six weeks from stem cell to supermarket shelf			2
time : once optimised , professor @entity31 's method could mean that the time from stem cell to supermarket shelf could be reduced to six weeks biology : @entity33 scientist @entity31 with samples of in - vitro meat , or cultured meat grown in a laboratory , at the @entity32 his work is funded by the @entity33 government , as well as an anonymous donation of 300,000 euros - but it remains to be seen , however , whether the pioneering development will find favour with a public that likes to think of its chops , steaks and sausages as having their roots in nature , rather than in test - tubes			1
he first attempts involved mouse burgers			0
he then tried to grow pork in a dish , producing strips with the rubbery texture of squid or scallops , before settling on beef			2
his burger consists of about 20,000 thin strips of cultured muscle tissue			2
the cell - grown burger is produced with materials — including fetal calf serum , which used to grow the cells — that will eventually be replaced by materials not orginating from animals , the @entity111 reported			1
in - vitro meat or cultured meat is an animal flesh product that has never been part of a complete , living animal , and is quite different from imitation meat or meat substitutes , which are vegetarian foods made from vegetable proteins like soy			0
scientists say that it is possible the meat will be sold to the public within ten years			0
it also reduces the amount of feed , water and fuel needed to produce beef			1
every kilo of meat requires 10 kilos of plant feed and oil , but cultured meat would only need two			0
according to the @entity144 we will be eating twice as much meat as we do now by 2050			0
each individual in @entity147 eats on average 85kg meat a year			0
professor @entity31 added : ‘ it comes down to the fact that animals are very inefficient at converting vegetable protein into animal protein			1
this helps drive up the cost of meat			1
’ it is thought that the new form of meat could be acceptable to vegetarians , and animal rights organisations have already given their approval			0
environmentally friendly : cultured meat uses 99 per cent less land than regular livestock @entity167 spokesman @entity166 said : we do support lab - grown meat if it means fewer animals are eaten			1
anything that reduces the suffering of animals wold be welcome			0
’ @entity167 also runs a competition offering a $ 1million prize for the person who invents an artificial form of chicken meat			1
@entity179 scientists said in 2011 that cultured beef would need 45 per cent less energy that natural beef			0
they added that it would require 99 per cent less land than regular livestock and produce between 78 and 95 per cent less greenhouse gas			0
but , the difficulty may be persuading the public to eat an artificial product			0
professor @entity31 said that it is possible to add fatty tissue and nutrients to it , changing the taste and making it more palatable for the public			1
but before it became commercially viable , the @entity197 have said that they would have to provide evidence showing it is safe for the public to consume and nutritionally equivalent to regular meat .			0

the artificial burger will be cooked and served for the first time this week
it cost in the region of £ 250,000 to produce the *prototype*
the 5oz beef burger is grown from the stem cells of one cow
creator professor @entity31 believes the development could help solve *problems* in the meat *industry*
