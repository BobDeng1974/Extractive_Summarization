' i wo n't stop ' : father of 40 @entity5 , left and right with his fiancée @entity18 , says he wants more children because it is ' @entity21 ' his relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising , and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives			1
if they had completed just one year in care each , it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £ 2.4million			1

’ family : @entity5 says that he loves sex and wo n't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care @entity91 ’ @entity90 chief executive @entity89 said : ‘ it is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious			1
' it is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill			0

one said he had ‘ padded ’ his numbers by including his ex-partner ’s stepchildren			0
he added : ‘ he ’s no angel after a drink but he is n’t the big ladies ’ man that he likes to think he is			0
' he ’s definitely had a football team ’s worth of little ’ uns – maybe 16 – just because he ’s not fussy and not careful			0

‘ i feel like i ca n’t even leave my house without people judging			0
get off my back , i did n’t ask my dad to do what he ’s done with his life			0
