by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 11:40 est , 20 february 2013 a @entity2 soldier today won a major victory in a bitter transatlantic tug - of - love battle with his @entity6 ex-wife over custody of their six - year - old daughter			1
sergeant @entity10 claims @entity11 should be living with him in @entity12 and not with her mother @entity13 4,000 miles away in @entity14			1
today , @entity2 ’s highest court , the @entity2 @entity15 , sided with mr @entity10 in unanimously dismissing a lower court ’s ruling that the child should be allowed to stay in @entity6 with her mother			1
legal fight : @entity2 soldier @entity10 ( right ) has won a major victory in a bitter transatlantic tug - of - love battle with his @entity6 ex-wife over custody of their six - year - old daughter , @entity25 ( left ) bitter battle : @entity28 claims his daughter should be living with him in @entity12 and not with her mother @entity13 ( pictured ) 4,000 miles away in @entity14 following the 9 - 0 decision , chief justice @entity30 wrote for the court : ‘ this dispute is very much alive , ’ adding that the @entity36 ‘ continue to vigorously contest the question of where their daughter will be raised ’			1
however , the senior @entity2 judge noted that separate custody hearings are already under way in @entity6 and warned that a @entity6 court may simply ignore the @entity2 @entity15 judgment			1
the increasingly acrimonious fight is believed to be the first case involving a @entity6 individual ’s rights to have reached the @entity2 @entity15 , which only rules on family matters when they are of national significance			1
@entity28 , a bomb disposal expert , has questioned his ex-wife ’s parenting			0
miss @entity13 , however , says that @entity25 is better off with her and that @entity28 has ‘ left her with nothing ’ because of her huge legal bills			1
firing back : miss @entity13 says that @entity25 is better off with her an earlier hearing in a lower court in @entity12 had awarded miss @entity13 custody of @entity25 after agreeing that , under a 1980 @entity59 signed by the @entity2 and @entity60 , @entity14 had been @entity25 ’s ‘ habitual residence ’ for most of her life , so she should go back there			1
a subsequent appeal by @entity28 was thrown out after the 11th @entity64 ruled the issue was moot because the girl by then was already in @entity6 and beyond its control			2
however , when @entity28 took his case to the @entity15 it ruled unanimously that the appeals court was wrong not to have considered the merits of his claim			2
in a concurring opinion , justice @entity73 noted the legal confusion arose because the @entity76 did not indicate how custody appeals should be handled under the @entity59 on the @entity78			0
the near two - year delay in @entity25 ’s case ‘ is hardly consistent with the convention ’s objectives , ’ @entity73 wrote			2
lawyers for both parties were unavailable for comment following the decision			0
previously , @entity28 said his daughter was being shielded from the row so as not to upset her			0
he said : ‘ it ’s not for her to know at this age			0
when she ’s older she will know , but right now i would just rather she play with her dolls instead of being concerned about big court battles			0
’ miss @entity13 , 35 , met @entity28 , 42 , on an online dating site while he was stationed in @entity95 in 2006 and they were married the following year at @entity97 near @entity98 , @entity99			2
they moved temporarily to @entity12 , but she returned to live in @entity6 for a large part of the time while he was on tours of duty in @entity105			2
things began to sour between them two years ago and , while in the @entity2 , she was arrested on @entity108 , 2010 , for allegedly threatening him with a knife , though she denies this			0
not over yet : @entity28 , pictured with @entity25 , was warned by a @entity15 judge that a @entity6 court may simply ignore their judgment that month , miss @entity13 was also arrested for alleged public drunkenness for apparently getting into a fight with a taxi driver			1
no charges were brought , but while she was in custody police realised she was in the @entity2 on a 90 - day tourist visa and she was deported			2
miss @entity13 , an administrator , won ‘ humanitarian parole ’ from the immigration service and was allowed back in to attend a hearing in an @entity12 court in which she was awarded custody of @entity25			1
@entity28 has claimed he was only given 20 minutes to say goodbye to @entity25 in the court ’s car park before @entity127 took her back to @entity6			1
he said : ‘ it was horrible			0
she did n’t know what was going on			0
she was looking to me for answers and i could n’t give them to her			0
‘ @entity25 is my everything			0
that ’s why i ’m fighting so hard to get her back into a safe place			0
’ miss @entity13 said she had been ‘ praying ’ for the @entity2 @entity15 to rule in her favour .			1

highest @entity2 court unanimously sides with *sgt* @entity10
he claims daughter @entity139 should be living with him in @entity12
