nine months ago the 45 - year - old was admitted to hospital suffering with cirrhosis of the liver as a result of drinking 350 units of alcohol every week for ten years			1
@entity2 ended up on a life support machine , and her skin turned a grisly yellow colour due to her massive organ failure			1
she was given a 5 % chance of survival and a priest was called to read her last rites			0
but she survived , and a picture taken of her at her lowest became the trigger for a turning point in her life			1
she is now sober , and feeling lucky to still be alive the former sales assistant appeared on this morning today to tell her story and warn other women about the dangers of alcohol , the legal substance which ruined her life			1
she said : ' that picture was the turning point			2
seeing how yellow i was			2
i went through a lot , i could n't even walk when i came off intensive care , but now it 's as if the illness has been lifted from my brain			0
' @entity2 began drinking when she was 17 , after leaving school to train as a sales assistant			1
naturally shy , drinking made her feel confident among her peers , and soon she was drinking 10 double brandy and @entity43 at the weekends			1
she said : i was always the first one in and the last person out of the pub. if someone offered me a drink and i already had one i would always take it			0
' when i was 28 i stopped going out because i could n't get as drunk as i wanted to			2
it 's not normal to drink like that			0
it 's a slippery road			0
i was born with the addiction			2
i was always going to be an alcoholic			2
' it was at the age of 28 that @entity2 also lost both her mother and father , which sent her drinking to new , more dangerous depths			1
she swapped @entity63 and brandy for wine because it was easier to get drunk and made her less aggressive			2
she said : ' being drunk means that you do n't have to feel things , you can get oblivious			0
' i have been in to rehab three times but each time i came out i would go and buy wine and drink			1
i did n't want to stop it , i wanted to get drunk			0
i liked the way it made me feel			0
' the 45 - year - old from @entity77 appeared on this morning today to warn other women of the dangers soon she was drinking five bottles of wine every day , and waking up in the middle of the night sweating and shaking			1
she lost her job because she was unable to hold down any kind of routine and then used all of her benefits money to buy alcohol , and spent all day watching tv and feeling depressed			0
despite attending @entity94 meetings and her visits to rehab it was a visit to her local gp which saved @entity2 's life			1
she was told that her liver was seriously damaged and immediately taken to hospital with cirrhosis where she collapsed and remebers little of the next few weeks of her life			1
after a 10 - week stay , when the picture of her turning yellow was taken , @entity2 was released			1
despite her ordeal , the first thing she did upon release was buy wine			0
luckily , she was disgusted with herself for doing it , and has been sober ever since			0
this picture of @entity2 was taken while she was in hospital suffering from massive organ failure ' at the moment , doctors are happy with my progress , but my life expectancy will be affected			1
my liver is so scarred , it will slowly stop functioning , ' she told @entity119			0
a scan in october will determine whether or not @entity2 needs a liver transplant			2
today she said : ' life is brilliant , i am happy			0
i was n't living before , just sleeping and drinking , sleeping and drinking			0
the drink takes over so very quickly			0
' my advice to other women in a similar situation is to go to your gp , but you have to accept your situation and you have to want to stop			0
