' i , personally , would like to wish him every possible success at @entity4			0
and i am delighted that he continues to present our idiosyncratic business discussion programme , @entity152 , on @entity10			2
' @entity1 's appointment ahead of @entity4 's @entity25 , @entity154 and @entity27 , came as the @entity155 pointed to a ' continued gender imbalance in @entity6 output '			1
it said there needs to be ' a co-ordinated plan from the executive ' to address the issue			0

' on a separate report on diversity , the @entity6 said it had 2,522 ethnic minority staff in 2012 , rising to 2,553 in 2013			2

the report said that women at the @entity6 have a redundancy rate of 51.9 per cent compared with the 48.6 per cent staff population			2
@entity187 ( left ) came under fire in an interview with @entity1 on @entity10 's @entity190 @entity1 has been no stranger to controversy in his time presenting the today programme on @entity10			1
in 2012 he came under fire following an interview with @entity187 where he repeatedly spoke over the chancellor as he tried to answer questions			0
the interview began with the presenter asking @entity187 if government borrowing would have gone up without income from selling the rights to operate @entity204 mobile phone services : @entity1 : just to be absolutely clear , if you strip out all of the accounting changes , the @entity207 , post , the different treatment of banks , the asset purchase facility , all those things , if you take those out and you take out the @entity204 licence , borrowing would actually go up this year ? it ’s a simple , simple question , and i am asking you if that ’s the case or not			1
@entity187 : well , i just do n’t think you can strip out ... @entity217 : it ’s extraordinary you ca n’t answer			0
@entity220 : i am sorry , i am answering your question , it ’s not that i am not answering it , it ’s like saying if we went ahead with the fuel duty rise in january , which is the same month that the 4g receipts are scored , well what would happen then ? @entity217 : well that would be a perfectly reasonable question but i did n’t choose to ask it			0
@entity220 : or , indeed , what happens if we do or do n’t go ahead with the big increase in investment allowances			0
@entity217 : another interesting question which i did n’t choose to ask			0
@entity220 : i would say the money we get from the @entity204 receipts , which is an independent number , that money enables us in the round , with all the other things going on , to help small businesses to help fund capital investment , for example in further education colleges and schools			0
so it ’s all part of a whole ... what i am saying is that it ’s a pretty desperate attempt ... @entity217 : well it ’s not a desperate attempt			0
@entity220 : i ’m sorry , i ’m sorry , as you know this is what the @entity258 put out to try and explain the fact that they put out for weeks in advance saying that the deficit was going up when in fact the deficit is coming down			0
@entity217 : mr @entity187 , everyone was surprised , the @entity258 was surprised , the @entity55 was surprised , a lot of people , i was surprised , people covering it on telly were surprised , everyone was surprised			0
@entity272 complained to the @entity6 following the 13 - minute encounter on @entity10 ’s today programme because of the ‘ unacceptably hostile ’ tone of the interview			1
his interrupting tactic also caused backlash in an interview with @entity280 and @entity282 mp @entity281 over the issue of increased rail fares , where it was argued he imposed his own bias on staying in the @entity288			0
he concludes : ‘ i do n’t want to get into a big debate over welfare right now			0
we have got the point			0
you want to cut benefits			0
we are out of time			0
’ earlier in 2012 , whilst presenting the same radio programme , he controversially asked @entity297 whether conservatives were as comfortable as @entity258 supporters with the @entity300 as ‘ a really fantastic advert for multicultural , multiethnic @entity64 ’ .			2
