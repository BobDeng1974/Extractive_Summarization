by : @entity0 published : 21:48 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 11:48 est , 18 september 2012 @entity1 has flown in by helicopter to view the world famous @entity4 he paid just £ 250 for - boasting he had got ' one of the greatest bargains of all time '			1
@entity9 @entity8 - who has an £ 87million fortune - snapped up the bridge which has been dismantled after 30 years at the @entity12 circuit in @entity13			1
but he was taken aback today when he saw just how big it actually was exclaiming : ' sh * t it 's massive			1
' bargain : @entity8 @entity1 checks out his latest purchase after saturday 's auction @entity1 , 46 , bought the whopping 230ft - long bridge - which resembles a huge car tyre - after it was auctioned by @entity22 at the @entity24 race meeting in @entity25 on saturday			1
the ginger - haired @entity8 , who has a fleet of top - of - the - range @entity29 and classic cars , told listeners on his breakfast show he had bought the bridge			1
all mine : the ginger - haired @entity8 seemed thrilled with the results of the auction			1
he joked that he was going to erect it over the top of his neighbour ’s house in @entity41 but yesterday vowed to have it re-built in @entity13 for race fans to enjoy			1
after touching down on the race track by helicopter , he took a spin in a white @entity47 around the course before spending half an hour sitting on one of the 18 large sections of bridge			2
touch down : the car enthusiast used an alternative mode of travel to visit @entity12 he said : ' it ’s a lot bigger than i thought			1
sh * t it ’s massive			2
i did n’t realise how chunky it was			2
i ca n’t believe how big it is			2
' it ’s huge is n’t it ? it ’s the kind of thing you have on a farm to hold livestock in			2
oops : the bridge was a bit bigger than @entity1 had imagined when he put in his bid ' we ’ve got to erect it somewhere			2
that ’s what we are going to talk about while we are here			2
' we were going to take it back to @entity41 and erect parts of it in my garden with my neighbour ’s and the local council ’s permission but there have been calls this morning to leave it here because this is its home			1
national landmark : the bridge 's new owner has sparked a lot of interest ' it ’s one of the most important pieces of sporting memorabilia in the world so if @entity12 wants it to stay here then it can			1
' we would like to find somewhere to re-erect the bridge and we would like things to happen under that bridge			0
flying visit : @entity1 looked excited but a little overawed with the bridge ' it was only £ 250 , it was one of the greatest bargains of all time			0
it ’s just over a pound per foot			0
it ’s beyond a bargain , it redefines the term bargain			0
' the auction price was a few thousand , then it came down to £ 1,000 , then £ 500 and i thought i ’d bid £ 250 just to start it off			1
' but no - one else bid so i got it			2
i want to form a society and have an annual meeting at the bridge			0
' i think the bridge should have its own @entity123 account			0
it ’s big , it ’s cumbersome and right now it ’s a bit of a problem but we need to get it back up			0
' asked if he would sell the bridge to be used at music festivals such as @entity132 , @entity1 added : ' i do n’t want to sell the bridge			0
i want to retain ownership of the bridge and keep it safe			0
' it ’s available for hire or to be played under so we will see			0
' on his show @entity1 , who also presents @entity138 described his new purchase as a ' national landmark ' and appealed for help getting it from the track to his house			1
and despite conceding there could be ' planning issues ' , @entity1 , who also presents @entity138 , joked he was going to put up the bridge in his garden over the top of his neighbour ’s house			1
landmark : the @entity4 at @entity12 was placed over the @entity13 track in 1977 car mad : @entity1 , 46 , has a fleet of luxury cars , including a £ 5.6m @entity158 he said : ' all kids listening to this show would say ‘ yeah , why would you not buy a bridge ? ’ ' there will be planning issues of course , with a temporary structure , but if we whittle it away at either end , affectionately and sympathetically , because it is a national landmark , i think i can get it down to four metres ? ' @entity1 owns a fleet of luxury cars , including a £ 5.6m @entity158			1
@entity176 company @entity175 originally paid for the bridge to be put over the @entity13 track in 1977			0
the structure was based on an identical bridge which has stood over the @entity181 , home of the @entity181 24 hours , since 1932			0
in 2009 the bridge was dismantled during planned renovations for the circuit ’s former operator ’s botched attempts to host the @entity189 @entity188			0
when the move collapsed the owners of the circuit were unable to restore the bridge to its position over @entity195 due to health and safety laws			0
auction : construction workers remove part of the iconic bridge earlier this month @entity201 , managing director at the circuit , said : ' it had just been lying there in twenty pieces in a yard , which needs tidying up - so somebody had the idea of auctioning it off			1
' every now and then you ’ve got to make some changes and we ’ve got to tidy up the yard			0
' the lot bought by @entity1 comprises 16 panel pieces which made the arch that decorated the footbridge .			0
