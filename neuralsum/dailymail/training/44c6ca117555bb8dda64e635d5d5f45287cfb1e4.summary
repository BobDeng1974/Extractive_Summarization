by @entity0 at first glance this map might look like a @entity3 spitting out colourful sparks , but this stunning image in fact shows the routes of millions of commuters who journey into @entity11 every day			2
the map was created by an academic who used data collected by 50 million oyster card journeys to investigate how people arrive at their workplace in capital			1
the result is fresh look at the busiest stations used by commuters and while there are some notoriously hectic spots like bank listed , there are also some surprising omissions , including @entity28			1
dr @entity30 's map shows the connections formed between all @entity11 stations and their most popular destinations			1
a link has been drawn between the two places , and the link and points coloured according to the destination			0
each destination is given a different colour dr @entity30 , a research associate at @entity42 's @entity43 ( @entity44 ) created the map based on data collected at the busiest times on weekday mornings – between 7am and 10am			1
‘ looking at morning peak , as we have done here , we can start to understand a little more about the relationship between where people live and where they work , ’ he told the @entity49			2
his map suggests that @entity56 workers are most likely to live in east @entity11 or @entity57 , while people living south of the @entity58 tend to use @entity59 , @entity60 or @entity61 to get to get to work			1
the trends indicated by the map ( pictured ) hint at the interdependencies that underlie the relationships between places in @entity11			0
it is clear , for example , that much of travel from south @entity11 is focussed on just three end points ¿ @entity59 , @entity61 , and @entity60			1
he told @entity73 : ' i think the map shows some well understood and some not - so - obvious trends			0
the fact that travel from south @entity11 is attracted to only three main stations - @entity61 , @entity59 and @entity60 - is maybe predictable , but the map reflects well the dependency that south @entity11 holds on these few stations			1
' likewise , the strong connections between the @entity56 and east @entity11 may be well known , but the map shows how widely this influence spreads			1
' the data represents 48.9 million journeys documented over 49 days in the summer of 2012 - which average out at one million morning peak trips per day and night			0
strikingly , @entity28 is missing from the map			0
dr @entity30 explained in a blog post that despite popular perceptions , the station is not a popular end - point for commuters as there are currently not many offices nearby , but it remains one of @entity11 ’s busiest stations			1
dr @entity30 , a research associate at @entity42 's @entity43 ( @entity44 ) created the map as a different way to understand @entity11 's travel network			1
here , the iconic @entity103 is pictured the data represents 48.9million journeys documented over 49 days in the summer of 2012 - which average out at one million morning peak trips per day and - strikingly @entity28 ( pictured ) is missing from the map			2
dr @entity30 explained in a blog post that despite popular perceptions , the station is not a popular end - point for commuters ‘ this may not be where people end their trips			1
they [ commuters ] may well pass through @entity116 – indeed , a failure at @entity118 could be catastrophic for many travellers – but it is not where the leave the system , ’ he wrote			0
‘ in this sense , @entity118 is an important point on the network but not a place that many people actually get off			0
’ ' the same might be said for places like @entity128 and @entity130 - important points on the network , but not the final destination for many , ' he told @entity73			0
some of @entity11 ’s tourist hotspots and business hubs have unpredictable travel patterns as they attract people who live all over @entity11 and its sprawling suburbs			2
locations such as @entity139 and @entity140 attract travellers from all over the city , dr @entity30 explained			2
dr @entity30 said : ' i think the map shows some well understood and some not - so - obvious trends			2
the fact that travel from south @entity11 is attracted to only three main stations - @entity61 , @entity59 and @entity60 - is maybe predictable , but the map reflects well the dependency that south @entity11 holds on these few stations he said that the popular shopping destination ’s star - like distribution of links indicates that it is attractive to commuters from all over the capital			1
‘ @entity140 , too , shows a spread of origin points to the east , the north - west along the jubilee line and to the south - east , ’ he wrote			0
dr @entity163 believes the trends might show the accessibility of these stations across multiple routes and their accessibility from all over the @entity11			0
' the general assumption too is that most travel revolves around central @entity11 , but the map reflects a different story in the outer suburbs			0
' as we move away from central @entity11 , the influence of places like @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 increases and there are clearly some very important local patterns in these areas			0
' his work is part of ongoing research into how @entity191 data can describe travel behaviour in @entity11			2
' the aim is that the lessons we learn here can be used to inform how we improve and extend the transport network in @entity11 , ' he added .			0

an academic at @entity42 investigated how people get to work around the capital and found some surprising omissions , including @entity28 , which is not an end destination for many commuters
