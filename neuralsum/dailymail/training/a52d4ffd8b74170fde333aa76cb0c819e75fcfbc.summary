@entity9 looks like a regular bicycle , with traditional foot pedals , but additionally comes with a set of cranks that the rider turns with their arms to make it easier and faster when cycling the aluminium bike weighs 15kg , costs £ 4,000 and can be bought in white , black and gold , pictured the @entity9 allows the rider to use their whole body to ride the bike and the person behind the invention is confident it goes faster than regular bicycles			1
@entity20 said : ' @entity42 had always been too one - sided for me as the power only comes from the legs			1
' the upper body is static , it gets no exercise and is completely neglected			0
' our objective was to create a bicycle which is driven by the whole body that is even faster than a conventional bicycle			0
' a recent study by the @entity54 found that although the same heart rate is achieved with an arm - and leg - powered drive , the cyclist can achieve 31 per cent more power			1
in addition , the continuous power output is higher so the overall workout is more effective			2
the aluminium bike weighs 15kg , costs around £ 4,000 and can be bought in a one - sized frame in white , black and gold			1
a recent study by the @entity54 found that although the same heart rate is achieved when arm cranks are added to a bicycle , like those on the @entity9 , pictured , an arm - and leg - powered drive gives a cyclist 31 per cent more power mr @entity20 added : ' because you have 30 per cent more power it is easier to climb hills and the rider can go faster			1
' it is also easier on longer rides as you can use arm and leg drive in varying intensity , allowing individual muscle groups to relax repeatedly while riding			0
' it is more fun when you can vary between different cycling styles and alternate by using your arms and legs			0
' you have more drive power and you are faster , particularly when climbing hills			0
' you can choose to do high intense work out , cardio training or just cruise around			0
wherever you go with the @entity9 you exercise your whole body			1

' the 43 - year - old designer claims the bike was n't designed solely for pro-cyclists and can also be used by anyone during ' leisure time when cycling with friends and family ' mr @entity20 also revealed he uses it in his spare time and the @entity9 has n't been designed solely for pro-cyclists			1
' when you 're riding the bike it feels amazing			0
it 's incredible fun powering the @entity9 with the whole body			2
' i use it when ever i need a transportation device , or in my leisure time when cycling with friends or family			0
