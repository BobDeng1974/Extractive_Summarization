but the dogs were in the garden and the child has strayed into the garden			0
’ @entity60 's other grandfather said the boy was ' on the mend '			2

the doctors are saying they do n’t want him to get an infection			0
they are also saying he ’s got fluid on his lungs - it ’s a bit of blood but that ’s understandable after what he ’s been through			0
' everything we hear now is just a worry			0
' mr @entity166 said the boy was playing in a lane behind the family home at 6pm on sunday when the dog burst out of mr @entity1 ’s back yard			1

scene : an alleyway behind @entity210 in @entity17 , where the attack happened in june horror : the attack happened while @entity12 was being looked after by his grandfather in @entity210 ( above ) mr @entity166 , a lorry driver , continued : ‘ he managed to pull @entity214 on to his shoulders but the dog was still jumping up at him			1
it just kept coming back for more			0

’ mr @entity1 , whose son owned the dog , was watching the @entity229 celebrations in his end of terrace redbrick home when the canine entered the garden and sunk its teeth into the youngster ’s head			1
‘ all of a sudden the dog went outside			0
i heard squeaking and then i had to go outside to check on the dog , ' he said			0

i thought the neighbours had thrown a dolly over the fence but then i saw it was n’t a dolly because i saw all the blood			0
i ’m still in shock now			0
’ however , mr @entity1 was unapologetic talking at his home , lined with @entity250 ornaments and @entity252 drums , saying the parents should have been watching over their son			0
panic : the boy 's grandfather was also hurt as he tried to pull the animal away during the horrific incident in @entity260 @entity261 said the dog was due to be destroyed yesterday but no arrests had been made			1
in september last year , a police team raided mr @entity1 ’s address , and an officer was bitten by a dog after the animal had been tasered			1
it is believed that the police officer who went to the house after the mauling of @entity12 was the same police officer who was bitten on the hand by the dog last year			1

after the raid , police constable @entity283 from @entity261 said : ‘ the owner was trying to control the two of them but they were trying to fight each other and get at us			1
‘ i had to deploy my @entity290 to try to prevent them from attacking but one leapt up and bit me even after i hit it in the mouth			0
’ under the @entity304 , if a dog bites someone while on its owner ’s property , police are not required to take action unless the injury is severe or the dog is thought to be a danger to others .			1
