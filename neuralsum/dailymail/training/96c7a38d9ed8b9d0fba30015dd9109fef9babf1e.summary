‘ when we asked her for her medical history she told us that she was pregnant in 1978 but her child had died			0
' she told us she had got scared and went home to her village without ever removing the fetus			0
' she only took some treatment from her local a health centre			0
‘ it could be the world ’s longest ectopic pregnancy			2

' we asked for a detailed medical history and all we could get was that the patient 's brother told us that in 1978 she was pregnant and had some complications			0
' she apparently knew that the baby had died and that she would need an operation , and we gathered she got scared at the prospect of surgery and so went away to her village without undergoing the operation			0
' the team of surgeons discovered a mass containing a matured skeleton encapsulated in a calcified sac			0
the mass was found between the uterus , the intestines and bladder , densely stuck to all the organs			0
' the amniotic fluid that protects the foetus might have been absorbed and the soft tissues liquefied over time with only a bag of bones with some fluid remaining , ' dr @entity97 said			1
' for the last few months , the patient was experiencing pain and urinary problems with fever			0
he said this was caused by the mass compressing the urinary system , compromising the functioning of the kidneys			0
