@entity1 's driving run saw him equalise for @entity2 after the break - click here for our brilliant matchzone service it was what one might call a @entity10 moment			1
maybe a @entity11 moment for those whose memory extends to football 's golden age			0
@entity1 turned and ran , straight at the heart of the @entity18 defence			1
you know , like the great goalscorers do			0
in that instant of pure athletic acceleration nobody could live with him			0
not @entity24 , the stand - out defensive midfield player of this season , not @entity26 who appeared to be plodding through quick - drying cement by comparison			2
@entity1 , having dropped deep to receive the pass , was reaching top gear as he arrived in the penalty area , yet he did n't look at all hurried			1
as @entity32 began his advance he slipped the ball smartly past him and into the far corner			0
it was a gem of a goal , worthy of winning any match			0
that it only achieved parity for @entity2 is testament to @entity18 's defensive resilience			1
it was going to take something exceptional to breach that defence , and @entity1 provided it			2
credit , also , to his manager @entity47			0
after the @entity49 and @entity50 fixtures he gave @entity1 time off to recharge his batteries , as promised			1
@entity1 was pictured holidaying in @entity52			2
who do they think they are these softy footballers , unable to play a full season without taking off to the @entity57 ? and how foolish is that mug of a manager to fall for it ? yet @entity1 played as if revived			2
@entity60 comfortably stroked home a penalty in the 18th minute to give @entity18 the lead against @entity2 on tuesday night @entity1 celebrates after scoring a superb equaliser for the hosts in the 59th minute in the @entity67 semi-final @entity2 : mingolet 6.5 ; can 6 , @entity68 7 , @entity69 7 ; @entity70 7 , @entity71 8 ( @entity72 70 ) , @entity73 7 , @entity74 7 ; @entity75 6.5 , @entity1 8 , @entity76 7.5 subs not used : @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 goal : sterling 59 booked : @entity71 , @entity73 @entity18 : @entity32 8.5 ; @entity85 7 , @entity26 6 , @entity86 7 , @entity87 6 ; @entity24 6.5 , @entity88 5.5 ; hazard 7 , @entity89 7 , @entity90 7 ( @entity91 87 ) ; costa 6 subs not used : @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 goal : hazard 18 ( pen ) booked : @entity87 , @entity88 referee : @entity102 att : 44,573 he was a proper handful , buzzing around @entity18 's back line , desperately trying to make up for the absence of a genuine striker in @entity2 's ranks			1
with @entity109 still missing it speaks volumes that @entity47 prefers @entity1 to either @entity80 or @entity111			2
certainly it is hard to imagine either of his rivals scoring a goal of that quality on current form			0
just like @entity1 's trip to @entity52 , that was a bold managerial move			2
it would have been very easy for @entity120 to keep @entity93 in goal for one last game - particularly as this competition is regarded as the least important of @entity18 's quartet of campaigns			1
instead , @entity32 was recalled immediately , and was superb in keeping @entity2 at bay			2
he saved from @entity76 in the 67th minute , from @entity70 after 75 minutes and from @entity1 again when he tried to capitalise on the rebound a second later			1
true , @entity32 rode his luck when , in gathering the ball under pressure from @entity1 , he began to slide out of his area and regained control only with his elbow			0
it should have been a free - kick for handling , and in a dangerous area just outside the box , but referee @entity102 waved it away			0
moments later , the @entity137 made amends with a quite magnificent stop from @entity1			1
without him , this match could have got away from @entity18			0
they will most certainly have felt greatly relieved when @entity71 shot against the post after 66 minutes			1
@entity76 set him up and the goal was open in front of @entity145			0
perhaps he tried to place it too perfectly			0
with the momentum of a @entity71 goal at the right end , @entity2 's head of steam may have proved unstoppable			1
@entity71 was taken off soon after , no doubt with mixed emotions			0
he had more than played his part in @entity2 's comeback but that miss will have weighed heavily			0
it will be all about him again at @entity157 , too , with @entity18 's travelling contingent ignoring @entity120 's plea to show respect for a great player			0
hazard coolly wheels away after sending @entity2 goalkeeper @entity163 the wrong way from the penalty spot can ( right ) had been caught out of position in the build - up to the penalty incident before tripping the onrushing hazard @entity85 ( back ) joins in with the @entity171 ' celebrations after @entity60 had put them ahead at @entity2 @entity1 showcased his blistering pace as he cut @entity18 's defensive shape to pieces before sliding home an equaliser @entity1 bought himself a yard off @entity26 and placed across @entity32 to send @entity180 wild almost the entire @entity2 starting @entity181 rushed to congratulate their 20 - year - old attacker , who hauled them back into the tie @entity71 winces with anguish after hitting a post when he ought to have scored after @entity1 's stunning strike @entity75 ( left ) , can and @entity71 appeal loudly after @entity187 appeared to handle the ball in his own box @entity187 - lying on the ground - seemed to drag the ball back , which could have been construed as deliberate handball @entity88 lunges in on @entity1 with his studs showing as the @entity67 semi-final first leg started at pace @entity1 tries to weave a way beyond @entity18 's @entity197 midfielder @entity24 , with @entity89 watching on hazard proved a menace throughout - here attempting to dart away from @entity2 's main central defender @entity68 the game had n't even kicked off when the blue corner began taunting @entity2 's captain about the famous slip			1
the home fans immediately replied with their tribute and at one point in the first half the entire ground was singing @entity71 's name , with levels of appreciation at opposite extremes			1
@entity71 has heard it all before , of course , and as expected no man did more to try to get @entity2 's noses in front			1
this being his last season at @entity180 there is almost an entire area of @entity145 reserved for @entity71 - related banners			1
' the best there is , the best there was and the best there ever will be , ' said the largest , and most poetic - although it 's a depressing thought if the best @entity2 will ever have retires without a league championship winners medal			2
a more attainable ambition was contained in the message ' @entity230 to @entity231 '			0
as usual , though , if you want anything done properly do it yourself , and in the first half at least the duties of propelling @entity2 forward fell to the usual suspect again			2
it was @entity71 who forced the only two saves from @entity32 in the first half , @entity71 who was involved in just about every @entity2 move that was memorable or incisive			1
a fierce shot , 35 yards out , demanded the first stop of the game , then , when @entity26 fouled @entity1 on the left , it was @entity71 who curled a vicious free - kick in from a tight angle , bringing @entity32 into action once more			1
@entity197 defender @entity85 slides a ball beyond @entity74 into midfield from his station at right back @entity71 - who was mocked for slipping in this decisive @entity256 fixture last year - drove the @entity257 on from the off @entity71 is placed into the book by referee @entity102 after dumping @entity60 on his backside in the first half @entity1 amusingly tangles with @entity18 captain @entity86 in a tussle after half - time @entity32 was out quickly to thwart the strong running of @entity1 as @entity2 looked to get back in the game @entity68 ( right ) and @entity265 international @entity187 were always likely to enjoy a real battle and so it proved @entity69 ( left ) charges forward under the watchful eye of @entity18 's @entity270 midfielder @entity90 @entity69 rose highest against central defender @entity26 but was n't able to force home his header a determined @entity1 whips in a cross on his wrong foot after getting the beating of @entity90 @entity32 comes flying out from a corner to clear his lines in typically confident fashion @entity2 supporters ( alongside a chirpy steward ) hold a banner in support of their captain aloft during the semi-final first leg it was a brisk evening on @entity287 , with @entity18 manager @entity120 ( right ) wrapping up warm on the touchline @entity96 clearly felt the need to keep himself warm on the substitutes ' bench - pictured clutching a hot water bottle @entity120 shakes the hand of @entity71 after the central midfielder was replaced by @entity72 in the 70th minute that he did this in front of @entity18 ’s mocking fans made the attempt all the more ambitious			1
every neutral must have secretly wished for the perfect retort			0
the effect of his absence next season is close to incalculable			0
@entity18 , by contrast , had one first - half chance , and took it - from the penalty spot			1
@entity89 played the ball inside to @entity60 , who was bundled over clumsily by @entity308			1
@entity102 had no doubt and @entity60 stepped up to capitalise on his work			0
@entity137 against @entity137 , he sent @entity163 the wrong way , planting the ball low to the right			0
@entity2 will claim the award was soft , but they wo n’t have much of a case			0
can took a chance stepping into @entity60 ; a penalty the likely outcome			2
knowing what we know of @entity18 it was always a foolhardy move			0
goals like @entity1 ’s come rarely , @entity18 nick results like this in their sleep .			1

@entity60 gave @entity18 an 18th - minute lead from the spot after @entity308 had fouled the @entity137 in the box
@entity2 could have been awarded a penalty just before half - time when @entity187 appeared to handle
but @entity1 hit back in the 59th minute to ignite the @entity67 semi-final at @entity180
@entity2 captain @entity71 struck a post afterwards before being taken off for @entity72
