by @entity0 they may have failed to set @entity2 alight last season , but @entity6 forwards @entity4 and @entity7 have been on fire during pre-season			1
both players were brought in as part of @entity6 ' recruitment drive to replace @entity13 last summer but struggled to justify their price tags			1
however , each found the target again as @entity6 thrashed @entity17 6 - 1 in @entity18 on saturday - taking their pre-season goal tallies to three apiece			0
following such sizzling form , @entity4 posted a picture of the pair cooling down after training while sharing smiles that @entity6 fans will hope set the tone for the new campaign			1
@entity7 also had an uninspiring first season in north @entity48 , scoring only six league goals following his £ 26million move from @entity52			1
but , both have caught the eye of new manager @entity34 who is determined to restore their reputations as some of the most exciting talents in @entity57			0
. speaking of @entity4 , he said : ‘ we know the @entity4 from @entity32 and @entity58			0
but he is still young and the @entity60 is the most difficult league to play ; the style , the language			0
season to forget : @entity4 's statistics from last season make for unimpressive reading flop : the former @entity52 striker only managed six league goals following his £ 26m move last season ‘ but after one year we believe that @entity31 is ready to show his quality			1
‘ will he play as a no 10 or out wide ? it depends on the situation			0
my philosophy is to give a freer style with good organisation but not only with @entity31 ; with other players as well			0
’ @entity7 is desperate to prove himself in the @entity60 , despite @entity79 newspaper @entity78 reporting that @entity81 coach @entity80 is interested in taking him back to @entity82			2
