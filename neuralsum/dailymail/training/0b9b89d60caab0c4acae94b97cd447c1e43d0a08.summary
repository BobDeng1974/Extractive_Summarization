by @entity0 published : 04:42 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 03:30 est , 13 february 2013 @entity1 downed up to 10 litres of @entity2 every day and would go ' crazy ' without it a mother - of - eight , 30 , died suddenly from a cardiac arrest because she drank up to 18 pints of @entity2 every day for years , a coroner has ruled			1
@entity1 died on february 25 , 2010 , after her partner @entity7 found her seated on the toilet , slumped against the wall and gasping for air at their home in @entity13 on @entity15 's south island			1
an inquest last year revealed that she would drink at least four 2.5litre bottles of the fizzy drink each day , consuming more than twice the recommended daily caffeine consumption and more than 11 times the recommended sugar intake			1
@entity15 coroner @entity21 said today that ms @entity1 would not have died if it was n’t for her dependence on @entity2			1
' i found that , when all of the available evidence is considered , were it not for the consumption of very large quantities of @entity2 by @entity1 , it is unlikely that she would have died when she died and how she died , ' reported the @entity31			1
the coroner 's report revealed ms @entity1 suffered from a myriad of medical conditions , including a racing heart and ' absent teeth ' , which her family say was caused from @entity2 consumption			1
@entity40 was said to go ' crazy ' if she ran out of the fizzy drink which she guzzled by the bottle			1
mr @entity7 said she had been unwell leading up to her death and had no energy , but the idea @entity2 caused the problem had never crossed their minds			0
mr @entity7 told the court that she had been unwell up to a year before her death , including vomiting six times a week , but they believed it was caused by the stress of looking after her eight children and gynecological problems			0
' she drank at least 10 litres a day , ' he said			2
' as a family we wouldbuy four 2.5 litres a day , the maximum on special			2
' the @entity2 would be for @entity1 to consume over the course of the day			1
' the first thing she would do in the morning was have a drink of @entity2 andthe last thing she would do in the day was have a drink of @entity2 by her bed			1
' police who investigated the death , which happened on february 25 , 2010 , estimated she consumed , on average , seven litres a day			2
a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' we are disappointed that the coroner has chosen to focus on the combination of ms @entity1 ' excessive consumption of @entity2 , together with other health and lifestyle factors , as the probable cause of her death ' her partner said she was addicted to @entity2 and without it she would get moody , irritable and be low ' i did n't ever think about the @entity2			1
i never considered it would do any harm to a person			0
it 's just a soft drink , just like drinking water			0
i did n't think a drink 's going to kill you , ' he said			0
she had been drinking a lot of @entity2 over the past seven or eight years , ' he said			0
@entity87 , mr @entity7 's mother , said she would go ' crazy ' if she ran out of the drink			0
ms @entity1 is estimated to have drunk up to 50,000 pints of @entity2 before she died an autopsy showed miss @entity1 had a diseased @entity91 evidence stated that the main finding of death was from a cardiac arrhythmia			1
dr @entity95 told the court miss @entity1 probably had severe hypokalemia , a lack of potassium in the blood , relating to excessive consumption of soft - drink			1
he said although it was difficult to confirm this from postmortem tests , it was consistent with her symptoms of tiredness and lack of strength and other cases of heavy soft - drink consumers			2
he added it was likely the vomiting was due to too much caffeine , medically known as caffeine toxicity			0
@entity2 confirmed it had hired a security firm to shadow its staff , after mr @entity7 allegedly made death threats against the company before she died			0
he rejected claims he had made the threats , but said he held the company responsible for @entity126 ' death			0
@entity2 's @entity15 managing director @entity127 said at the time of her death that @entity7 's claims were ' patently untrue '			0
@entity2 's latest statement said : ' the coroner acknowledged that he could not be certain what caused ms @entity1 ' heart attack			2
' therefore we are disappointed that the coroner has chosen to focus on the combination of ms @entity1 ’ excessive consumption of @entity2 , together with other health and lifestyle factors , as the probable cause of her death			2
' this is contrary to the evidence that showed the experts could not agree on the most likely cause ' .			0

@entity1 drank an estimated 50,000 pints of the fizzy drink
she would suffer *withdrawal* symptoms and get moody without it
she drank it first thing in the morning and last thing at night
her family would buy her at least four 2.5l bottles a day
