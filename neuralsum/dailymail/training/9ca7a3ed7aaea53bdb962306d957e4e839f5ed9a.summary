by @entity0 for @entity1 the gloom that led to the abandonment of the first one - day international in @entity4 on monday was matched when @entity7 ’s @entity6 hopes were written off by two star ex-players			1
@entity9 , captain of the fabled 2005 @entity12 - winning side , and spinner @entity13 , who retired when the @entity12 were lost last winter , were damning in their condemnation of @entity7 ’s one - day cricket in an animated conversation on @entity19 ’s @entity18 as rain lashed @entity21			1
they also feel @entity24 should give up the 50 - over captaincy			0
@entity13 , who believes @entity7 are too influenced by statistics , said : ‘ i always felt we were so far behind the other one - day teams because we play such an old - fashioned brand of cricket			1
‘ some of my best mates — @entity24 , @entity41 and @entity42 — are not one - day players who are going to win you a @entity6			2
i love @entity24 dearly but i do n’t think he should be bothering to play one - day cricket			2
he does n’t need to			0
he ’s made a very good point in tests and he should leave one - day cricket to young people who can smash it everywhere and win you a @entity6			1
‘ we wo n’t win this one , there ’s no chance , but in four years we might if we get all these exciting players without any baggage into the team			0
@entity13 advocated the inclusion of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 in @entity7 ’s 50 - over team			0
‘ i ’d say @entity64 would be the ideal captain of the one - day side , ’ he added			2
no chance ? @entity24 should relinquish one - day cricket because @entity7 do n't have ' a cat in hell 's chance ' @entity71 : @entity24 ‘ does n’t need to ' play one - day cricket anymore and ' made a very good point in @entity47 ' @entity9 , who was critical of the omission of @entity74 from this series , was equally trenchant about what he sees as @entity7 ’s conservatism in limited - overs cricket he even said the selectors should have dropped him rather than let him captain the side at the ill - fated 2007 @entity6 in the @entity81			1
‘ we ’ve made the same mistake now that we made in my time , ’ said @entity9			0
‘ we ’re picking one - day squads on @entity47 form			1
you need power at the top , in the middle and at the end now			0
it ’s completely different because of @entity93			0
i look at @entity24 and he has proven all the critics wrong in the @entity47			0
but he ’s been playing since he was 21 and this would have been the perfect time to move over in one - day cricket and have a real good break			2
‘ he will do half a job as a batsman and i do n’t think he ’ll win games for @entity7 as a tactician in one - day cricket			1
‘ your captain has to perform and be a star player in the side			2
‘ i thought this was going to be the series where we were going to be a bit risky and pick a younger set of players who could strike at 89 and 95 ( runs per 100 balls ) and do some real damage			0
’ had his say : @entity9 admits @entity24 proved him wrong but says @entity7 's one - day game is unncessary star : @entity9 says ' your captain has to perform ' and used @entity121 's @entity120 as a leading one - day example			1

@entity7 will be *wasting* their time in @entity30 and @entity31 next year at @entity6 , say former leading stars @entity9 and @entity13
‘ i ’m the *biggest* @entity7 *fan* going but i do n’t think we ’ve got a cat in hell ’s chance in @entity30 , ’ believes @entity13
‘ we ’re picking one - day squads on @entity47 form . you need power at the top in the middle and at the end now , ' adds @entity9
@entity121 skipper @entity120 *hailed* as a leading example of one - day cricket because ' your captain has to perform and be the star player in the side '
