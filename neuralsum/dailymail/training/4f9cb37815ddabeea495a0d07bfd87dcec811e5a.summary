@entity0 will use his first appearance in @entity2 since @entity3 to try and win back some of the followers he lost by publicly declaring his support for the break - up of the @entity8			1
the former @entity3 champion opens the @entity10 at the @entity11 on saturday with a group match against @entity14 's @entity13 , who is making his debut in the field open only to the season 's top eight performers			2
@entity0 spent six weeks battling to qualify , and it will be interesting to see if there is any delayed fallout from his tweet in the early hours of @entity24 referendum day , in which he revealed a late conversion to the idea of independence			1
@entity0 smiles during a press conference ahead of the @entity29 in @entity2 the @entity8 no 1 finished the year strongly to qualify for the elite eight - man event @entity0 ( centre ) was involved in a ' selfie ' with his fellow @entity29 competitors on friday ' i have n't had an adverse reaction , the crowd has always given me very good support when i have played here and when i have played at @entity3 and @entity40 's throughout my whole career , ' he said			1
' i hope this week that is the same , but if not i will do my job and give my best effort regardless			0
hopefully i 'll win back some fans this week			0
' the sometimes impulsive @entity0 recently intimated he regrets the way he expressed himself , having managed to alienate numerous supporters in @entity48 and @entity24 – not to mention upsetting his sponsors – in less than 140 characters			1
@entity0 will face @entity51 finalist @entity13 in his first group rubber at the finals he has also reaffirmed his pride in representing @entity55 , but definitely he has much ground to make up after five years spent winning over more sceptical sections of the public with his maturity and outstanding career achievements			1
given the nature of tennis support in this country there is unlikely to be any perceptible hostility in the coming week , although this is an event where his backing has not been as unequivocal as it is at @entity68			2
two years ago he played @entity69 at the 02 and the cheering made it hard to tell who was the home player , although that was largely down to the @entity76 master 's global icon status and the international mix of the huge crowds this tournament attracts			2
@entity0 also shares a group with @entity69 , who has beaten him three times at the season ending finale @entity69 often receives equal support to @entity0 at the finals , despite the @entity88 's home advantage he is sure to play @entity69 again this week and will have to turn round a strangely poor record against the 33 year - old at the east @entity2 venue , which sees the world number two having won on all three occasions			1
@entity0 does not believe crowd support has been a factor , more the excellence of @entity69 in these conditions : ' the reason why he is difficult to beat is that he is incredibly good on these courts			1
he is a fantastic indoor player and has been all his career			0
when there is no wind or sun to throw him off , when he is on his game , he is incredibly tough to beat , but hopefully i will be able to do it this week			0
' @entity106 wins the @entity107 without dropping a set shortly after the birth of his first child the @entity111 is more than likely to finish the year as the world 's @entity112 ranked player take away the @entity115 in @entity2 and the 27 year - old @entity88 leads their career series 11 - 8			0
' i 'm quite surprised how well i have played @entity0 here , some matches i thought i might lose , ' said @entity69			2
' i do n't see this surface being helpful either to me or to him			0
' the @entity76 could mathematically take the year - end number one spot this week , but that would require an unexpected collapse from the incumbent @entity106 , a three - times winner who has a habit of finishing the season strongly			0
any suspicions that @entity106 might be distracted by the birth of his first child three weeks ago where quashed at the @entity107 , which he won without dropping a set .			0

@entity0 is set to open against @entity13 at @entity29
@entity133 no 1 aims to regain support after comments on @entity24 independence
@entity0 will also face @entity69 , who he has never beaten at the event
