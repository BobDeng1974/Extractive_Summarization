the contraption is fitted with a wireless cellular radio to stay connected to the internet at all times to deliver search results , provide turn - by - turn directions , and upload images			2
but such radios have come under fire for emitting potentially harmful electromagnetic radiation that could heat up in a similar way to mobile phones after uninterrupted use			0
nevertheless , despite the brief time @entity15 had the headset on , it appeared to work and provided an adorable insight into a world seen through the eyes of a toddler			1

turns out it 's actually pretty cool to get reminded what everything looks like from half my height			2
' he adds : ' @entity6 is going to be a great way for parents to memorialize a lot of firsts without managing birthday parties , juggling @entity138 presents , or trying to steady those first few steps while glancing over at a camera screen			0
' this puts the moment in point - of - view , and it does n’t create a spectator out of you			2
