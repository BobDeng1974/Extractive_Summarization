by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 19:21 est , 17 april 2012 a policeman at the centre of the @entity4 racism crisis is to be prosecuted for allegedly abusing a suspect			1
@entity7 @entity6 , 52 , was apparently recorded telling a 21 - year - old black man he ‘ will always be a n * * * * * ’ during last summer ’s riots			1
the decision to act is a u-turn for the @entity13 who originally expressed doubts about the case			1
@entity23 , a response officer based in @entity25 , @entity26 , has been suspended from duty since @entity28 claimed he was abused in the back of a police van on august 10			1
his recording forced senior officers to confront a backlog of outstanding racism claims			1
there are now 11 allegations involving 18 officers and a civilian worker under investigation by @entity4 and the @entity40			2
chaos : a @entity7 allegedly hurled racist abuse at a 21 - year - old black man during the riots in @entity26 last year ( file picture ) @entity46 , chief prosecutor for @entity26 , said she had advised the @entity40 to charge @entity47 despite the @entity13 's decision not to charge him in january			1
' in march , the complainant 's lawyers challenged that decision and , in accordance with standard @entity13 practice , @entity49 , deputy chief crown prosecutor for @entity50 , directed that the case be reviewed by a more senior lawyer who was not previously involved			2
' that review is now complete and the conclusion , based on all the evidence now available , is that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction to charge @entity47 with a racially aggravated public order offence contrary to @entity66 of the @entity67 and @entity68 of the @entity69			1
review : met commissioner @entity70 has appeared before mps over the force 's review of racist allegations ' when a review shows a previous decision not to prosecute is wrong , it is open to the @entity13 to rectify that error by bringing new proceedings			2
' ms @entity46 said the original @entity13 decision was ' regrettable ' , adding that a prosecution was necessary to maintain public confidence			2
@entity47 was suspended from his duties following a review of the mobile phone footage			2
the arrested man , named as @entity28 , 21 , from @entity88 , east @entity26 , was held on suspicion of drug - driving in august last year but no action was later taken			1
the charging announcement came as @entity72 commissioner @entity70 appeared before @entity72 over the force 's review of racist allegations			0
ms @entity46 said : ' as chief crown prosecutor for @entity26 , i have taken the decision in this case that , as well as there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction , and a prosecution being in the public interest , a prosecution is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system			0
' that is the test i must apply under the @entity109 when reinstituting a prosecution			0
' accordingly , i have advised the @entity40 to charge @entity47			0
' it is regrettable that the original decision was wrong , but i hope the action taken and my decision today demonstrates the willingness of the @entity13 to review its decisions independently and swiftly and to take appropriate action where necessary			0
' an additional charge of assault relating to an allegation of ' strangulation ' will not be pursued , the @entity13 said			0
there are now 11 separate racism allegations under investigation at the @entity72 involving 10 police officers ms @entity46 added : ' however , having now had opportunity to consider all available evidence , including the statements of others in the van alongside the recording , the lawyer reviewing the case concluded that the inconsistencies in the various accounts of what happened were such that no additional charge could properly be added			0
' the inconsistencies included a dispute over the identity of the officer who took hold of the complainant - the complainant said that this was one officer but all other witnesses dispute this			1
' there is also inconsistency over why the officer , who does accept that he took hold of the complaint , did so			0
he and other witnesses say it was in response to the complainant 's apparent aggression and in self - defence			1
' i agree with the conclusion that , in the circumstances , there is insufficient evidence to meet the @entity109 test for bringing charges			0
' another allegation of abuse by a police officer against a youth at @entity171 police station remains under consideration , the @entity13 said .			0
