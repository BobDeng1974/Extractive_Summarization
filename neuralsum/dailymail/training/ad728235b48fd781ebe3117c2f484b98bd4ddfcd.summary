by @entity0 published : 09:22 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 09:22 est , 25 july 2013 the birth of @entity2 has been a massive boon for many manufacturers , but one company lost out after it produced 5,000 commemorative plates celebrating the arrival of a ' @entity8 '			1
other objects produced to mark the historic birth this week include @entity11 , dolls and an official porcelain collection - but most had the wisdom to wait and find out the baby 's sex before launching their memorabilia			0
however , one unnamed firm supposedly had a tip - off from a royal insider that the @entity22 was set to give birth to a girl , and designed plates with the message : ' to celebrate the birth of the royal princess '			1
blunder : these plates were made by a company which could n't wait to find out the sex of the royal baby not a girl : @entity2 was born on monday afternoon , rendering the plates somewhat redundant the family - owned company is said to have had ' complete confidence in their inside man ' - but on monday evening , it was announced that @entity22 and @entity42 's new baby was in fact a prince			1
when the future monarch turned out to be a boy rather than a girl , the company was left with a vast amount of unsellable merchandise			1
the plates , which feature a stock photo of a baby alongside garish pink squiggles , are unlikely to be particularly popular now that the firm 's prediction has been proven wrong			0
the useless memorabilia was snapped up by online retailer @entity57 , which is selling the plates in lots of 50 , with each set costing £ 149 - or £ 2.98 per item			1
useless : the 5,000 plates which were produced were sold as a job lot to a wholesaling website on the website , the crockery is described as ' a piece of ( inaccurate ) history ' which will allow the buyer to ' give your colleagues the worst @entity73 gift ever ' or ' have a dangerous game of frisbee '			2
the listing , which is placed in the ' @entity78 's site , praises the ' obvious gimmick factor ' of the kitsch merchandise - although £ 149 seems like a lot to pay for an ironic purchase			2
suggestions for how to make use of a box of 50 plates include ' have a plate smashing contest ' and ' take up plate spinning as a hobby '			0
however , most people who buy the erroneous products will presumably be doing so as an investment - hoping that their relative rarity will ensure they are a good investment for the future			0
wholesale clearance appears to have taken account of this possibility , suggesting : ' wait for baby number two and hope it is a girl and sell them for considerable profit '			0
pricey : this official collection of royal memorabilia costs £ 195 for a loving cup and £ 45 for a dessert plate the company which made the plates was not alone in assuming that @entity22 would give birth to a girl - shortly before she went into labour , bookmakers were offering odds of 8/15 on a princess , compared to 11/8 for a prince			1
the assumption that the baby was more likely to be a girl is probably due to an apparent slip of the tongue from the @entity22 , who referred to ' our d - ' in a meeting with the public in march			2
in addition , many people were particularly excited about the possibility of a princess because of the recent law change ensuring that females can inherit the @entity131 throne on the same terms as males			0
royal fanatics looking for more accurate crockery can purchase an official plate from the @entity138 , for the price of £ 45			0
the official range of porcelain , which was announced yesterday , goes up to £ 195 for a limited edition loving cup .			2

unnamed company received ' insider tip - off ' that royal baby would be a girl
but when @entity2 was born they were left with useless merchandise
faulty plates are now being sold off in lots of 50 costing £ 195
