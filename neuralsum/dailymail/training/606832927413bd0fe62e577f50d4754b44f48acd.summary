a top academic claims that his career was ended after he publicly clashed with prince @entity3 over the issue of alternative medicine			1
prof @entity6 believes that he was ' treated like dirt ' after the @entity3 tried to ' silence ' him			2
his new book , a scientist in @entity11 , features the royal row and how it contributed to the loss of his job at the @entity15			1
prof @entity16 , left , claimed prince @entity3 , right , ended his career when they clashed over the value homeopathic medicine after the royal 's personal private secretary made a complaint about the academic @entity24 - born prof @entity16 set up the @entity26 's first chair in complementary medicine at the @entity15 in 1993			1
but his rigorous application of evidence - based science and outspoken views soon found him at loggerheads with supporters of alternative therapies such as homeopathy , including the @entity3			2
after being investigated over a complaint made by @entity3 's former private secretary , sir @entity36 , he retired early in 2011 and his department was closed			1
in his book , prof @entity16 describes the episode as ' the most unpleasant period of my entire professional life '			1
the trouble started in 2005 when prof @entity16 publicly attacked a draft report by economist @entity46 that had been personally commissioned by @entity3			1
he described the report , which claimed complementary and alternative medicine ( @entity49 ) was cost effective and should be available on the @entity50 , as ' complete misleading rubbish '			1
but prof @entity16 was himself strongly criticised for disclosing the report 's contents before they had been fully reviewed and published			1
on september 22 , 2005 , sir @entity36 wrote an official letter of complaint on @entity58 notepaper to the @entity15 's vice chancellor , citing a ' breach of confidence ' after the professor had been sent an early and incomplete draft of the report for comment			1
over the next 13 months , prof @entity16 says he was subjected to interrogations , ' dozens of cross-examining emails and letters ' and ' treated as guilty until proven innocent '			1
eventually he was told by the vice chancellor that a formal disciplinary warning ' would not be appropriate '			0
at the same time , he received a stern warning not to misbehave again			0
he wrote : ' i had been interrogated , investigated , treated like dirt for 13 months , and exonerated in the end			1
but even while acknowledging that i had not been guilty of any misdemeanour , my vice chancellor had issued an unambiguous warning to me : if i even thought of applying my personal ethical standards in any similar situation in the future , i would not be so lucky as to get away with it again			0
prince @entity3 has been a major supporter of homeopathic medicine in @entity26 , lobbying the government ' prince @entity3 's attempt to silence me , it seemed , had been successful			1
' in the years that followed , he says , support for his department dried up to the point where it could no longer function			2
speaking in @entity91 , prof @entity16 said : ' i was innocent , but all support broke down			1
my unit of 20 co-workers was systematically destroyed			0
' asked if he felt badly treated , he added : ' badly is an understatement			0
my line manager said to me " i know we 're treating you like shit "			0
' prof @entity16 , who has had 48 books published and more than 1,000 articles in peer - reviewed journals , remains steadfastly opposed to unproven alternative treatments , and openly critical of the @entity3			1
prince @entity3 has never made a secret of his interest in homeopathy			2
in july 2013 , he had a meeting with health minister @entity111 where he lobbied in favour of homeopathic medicine			0
@entity3 was understood to be unhappy that government plans to set up a register of practitioners of herbal and @entity120 medicine – designed to give them an element of respectability – have stalled			2
@entity124 mp @entity123 said that by promoting ‘ voodoo medicine ’ , @entity3 was putting himself in a ‘ very dangerous position ’ because as monarch he will have to be impartial			2
‘ the head of state , which he will soon be , has to remain above controversy			0
the only serious job of a head of state is to be above policy , ’ mr @entity123 said			0
‘ if he wishes to lobby ministers , he should stand for @entity135 or join a lobbying firm , but he should not be using his position as heir to the throne to do it			0
' of @entity3 ’s meeting with mr @entity111 , @entity58 said : ‘ the prince meets government ministers from time to time in his role as heir to the throne as well as @entity146 and this was one of those meetings			2
there was no specific agenda and a wide range of topics were discussed			0
’ in 2010 , the then @entity124 health minister @entity153 confirmed that prince @entity3 had brought up homeopathy in meetings with @entity156 , who was then health secretary			1
in a chapter of his new book entitled off with his head , he writes : ' prince @entity3 has continued to promote alternative medicine indefatigably , often showing himself unwilling or unable to distinguish between real health care and blatant quackery , between medicine and snake oil , or between the truth and some half - baked obsessions of his own			1
' he argues that while @entity3 no longer courts publicity as much as he used to , he continues to be an active proponent of alternative medicine while ' hiding ' behind the facade of the @entity170			2
the charity , which advocates a holistic way of looking at health ' making the connection between mind , body and spirit ' , arose from the ruins of the @entity179 which was disbanded in 2010			0
prof @entity16 insists he is not against all alternative or complementary therapies , and claims there is evidence that some , including certain herbal treatments and acupuncture , can be effective			1
others he dismisses as a waste of time and money and potentially dangerous			0
he is especially scornful of homeopathy , which is based on extreme dilutions of substances that are supposed to help the body heal itself			0
currently doctors can refer patients for homeopathy treatment on the @entity50			2
' for homeopathy we should be closing the book , ' said prof @entity16			1
' they 've had 200 years to prove that it 's anything more than a placebo			0
that proof has failed , so let 's now move on			0
' homeopathy is an example of a harmless treatment being quite harmful			0
' a scientist in @entity11 is published on january 20 by @entity210			0
a spokeswoman at @entity58 said : ' the @entity3 believes in combining the best of evidence - based , conventional medicine with an holistic approach to healthcare – treating the whole person rather than just the symptoms of disease and taking into account the effects on health of factors such as lifestyle , the environment and emotional well - being			2
' @entity227 is patron of over 30 healthcare organisations			0
