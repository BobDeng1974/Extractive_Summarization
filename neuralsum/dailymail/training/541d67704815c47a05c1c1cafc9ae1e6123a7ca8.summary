@entity0 's has paid out $ 700,000 to members of the @entity2 after one of its franchise restaurants in @entity6 falsely advertised its food had been prepared according to @entity10 dietary laws			1
a @entity2 @entity12 resident , @entity11 , claimed he bought a chicken sandwich in september 2011 at a @entity0 's but found it was not halal - meaning it did not meet @entity10 requirements for preparing food			1
the restaurant is one of two in @entity21 which sells halal products to cater for an area with one of the nation 's largest @entity26 and @entity2 communities			1
settlement : a @entity2 customer claimed he was served a non-halal meal at this @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity21 , @entity6 , where they advertise halal @entity35 and @entity36 sandwiches mr @entity11 then approached lawyer @entity38 who together conducted an investigation before launching a class - action lawsuit on the ground the franchise sold non-halal food ' on many occasions '			1
@entity0 's and @entity45 agreed to the tentative $ 700,000 ( Â£ 442,000 ) settlement , with the money to be shared by mr @entity11 , a @entity12 health clinic , the @entity49 in @entity21 and lawyers			1
@entity11 's attorney , mr @entity38 , said that he is ' thrilled ' with the preliminary deal that 's expected to be finalised on march 1			2
@entity53 approved : @entity55 and @entity36 sandwiches are two of the dishes served at the @entity12 restaurant that are advertised as being halal @entity0 's and @entity45 deny any liability but say the settlement is in their best interests			1
the @entity12 area is home to about 150,000 @entity10 of many different ethnicities and the two @entity0 's branches advertise that they exclusively sell halal @entity55 and @entity36 sandwiches			1
@entity10 dietary guidelines state that meat must be prepared in a certain way before it can be eaten			0
@entity74 's name must be pronounced over the meat as thanks during the slaughter process , which can only be done with a swift incision to the animal 's throat			2
the animal must then be allowed to drain of blood as it is considered harmful for humans to consume			0
the animal must never see another being slaughtered nor can it see the blade being sharpened			0
halal literally means ' permissable ' in @entity85 and is used to describe types of actions that are acceptable under @entity10 law			2
so when referring to food , @entity53 meat means food that has been prepared in accordance with the laws of @entity10			0
they have to get those products from an approved halal provider where @entity98 's name has been invoked before an animal providing meat for consumption is slaughtered			2
he said there was no evidence of problems on the production side , but mr @entity106 alleges that the @entity21 location on @entity32 sold non-approved products when it ran out of halal			2
mr @entity38 said he was approached by mr @entity11 over the issue , and they conducted an investigation			0
a letter sent to @entity0 's and @entity45 by mr @entity38 's firm said mr @entity11 had ' confirmed from a source familiar with the inventory ' that the restaurant had sold non-halal food ' on many occasions '			1
after they received no response to the letter , mr @entity38 said , they filed a lawsuit in @entity124 @entity123 in november 2011 as part of a class action			0
in the settlement notice , @entity45 said it ' has a carefully designed system for preparing and serving halal such that halal chicken products are labelled , stored , refrigerated , and cooked in halal - only areas '			1
the company added it trains its employees on preparing halal food and ' requires strict adherence to the process '			0
he said although mr @entity11 believes @entity0 's was negligent , there was no evidence that the chain set out to deceive customers			1
' @entity31 from the very beginning stepped up and took this case very seriously , ' mr @entity38 said			0
' they made it clear they wanted to resolve this			0
they got ahead of the problem			0

two @entity0 's restaurants in @entity12 advertise halal @entity55 and @entity36 sandwiches
but a @entity2 customer claims to have been served a non-halal meal in 2011
@entity0 's and @entity45 have agreed preliminary settlement
@entity12 has one of @entity163 's largest @entity26 and @entity2 communities
