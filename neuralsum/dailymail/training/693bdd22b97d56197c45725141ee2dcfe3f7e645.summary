by @entity0 at 28 , @entity1 has made a considerable name in top - class football			1
he has performed with distinction , he has represented his country , and clubs have paid more than £ 10million for his services			1
yet when his career is done , he may be remembered for a single , instinctive decision , taken on a spring evening in @entity11			2
the circumstances are swiftly recalled : @entity13 and @entity14 were without a goal at @entity16 when @entity1 ran into the penalty area and the @entity14 full - back , @entity19 , responded with an artless lunge			1
his studs connected with the attacker ’s knee , and we awaited the tumble and the inevitable penalty			1
instead , @entity1 did something extraordinary : he stumbled , staggered … and stayed on his feet			1
the ball ran loose , the chance escaped and the bewildered referee took no action			2
@entity13 went on to lose the match , whereupon the roof fell in			1
clash : @entity1 stayed on his feet after colliding with @entity19 at best , it was said , @entity1 was woefully naïve ; at worst , he was criminally negligent			1
for by electing to do the decent thing , he had transgressed football ’s most sacred code ; the one which states that cheating is not merely acceptable but , where a penalty is at stake , it is compulsory			1
here we should have some sympathy with @entity49 , which is not a phrase which trips off the keyboard			2
the @entity13 manager expressed his position with clarity			1
‘ a foul is a foul , ’ he said			2
‘ you get slaughtered for diving but when someone is honest , you do n’t get what you should get			2
there ’s no reward for being honest			2
’ but he concluded , ruefully yet generously : ‘ you ca n’t ask players who are honest to be any different			2
it ’s against their nature			2
so you just hope the referee gives you the decision you deserve			2
’ indeed you do and , by failing to meet those reasonable expectations , the referee , @entity68 , deserves the harshest criticism			2
given the clearest of views , @entity68 declined to act upon the evidence of his eyes			2
with cheating so rife , we do not expect infallibility from our officials but we do expect a minimum of competence			2
criticism : @entity1 was labelled as naive for staying on his feet and not trying to win a penalty it was at this stage that @entity85 intervened and transformed a spat of small consequence into a curiously important debate			1
in the course of his brief media career , the former @entity90 captain has earned a reputation as a perceptive pundit			0
but from time to time his basic instincts emerge , and he reprises his rabble - rousing , ref - baiting glory days			1
@entity85 did n’t begin to understand or even recognise the problem			0
instead , he embraced the role of the old pro : hard - nosed , telling it like it is			1
he sneered at poor , misguided @entity1 : ‘ you can be an angel and do what @entity1 did , and he can get a pat on the back from his @entity107 when he goes home tonight			1
or he can win his team a penalty			1
and a professional in the game must say : you got ta go down			0
’ in other words , you ’ve got to cheat , because you ’re a pro. it does n’t come naturally , mind			0
‘ you ’re not brought up in @entity117 to think about diving , ’ says @entity85			0
‘ we ’re the only country that thinks the way we do			0
every single country in @entity123 and the world would have said , “ he ’s mad			0
we naturally think , “ fantastic			0
you stayed on your feet ”			1
‘ but when you ’ve been through the professional game and you ’ve been stitched up by foreign players so many times … if you ca n’t beat ’ em , join ’ em ’			0
he seemed dimly aware that his attitude might raise a few eyebrows			0
but old pros care little for the disapproval of civilians			0
‘ i suppose in some ways people can say , “ it ’s disappointing to hear you say that , @entity85 ” , ’ he acknowledged			0
‘ well , be disappointed			0
because ultimately , that ’s the game			0
that is the game ! ’ it is the kind of justification we have heard from cricketers who refuse to walk or sprinters who dally with stimulants			0
and i ’ve no doubt that @entity85 meant every word			0
on target : @entity1 ( left ) scored but @entity13 were still beaten by @entity14 at the @entity155 equally , i ’ve no doubt that he was talking dangerous nonsense			1
for he is not merely a media figure , he is a man who won 85 @entity117 caps and who now helps coach the national team			0
and the message from a national coach is that it ’s perfectly acceptable to dive and cheat , because that ’s what @entity166 does			0
i can not imagine how that goes down with all those teachers who attempt to instil honest values , all those parents who endlessly encourage their children because they believe that the game has uplifting lessons to impart , and all those young people who are entitled to expect civilised direction from a national figure and are given instead the cynical cliches of a disaffected old pro. before the week was done , @entity1 was starting to reconsider			1
‘ maybe i should have been a bit cleverer and do what other players have done			0
perhaps then , i could have got the penalty , ’ he said			1
i hope the thought was swiftly banished , because clearly he is much better than that			0
for @entity1 has been tested			1
in the course of those few micro- seconds , he weighed his decent instincts against his bogus ‘ professional ’ obligations			0
and , to his undying credit , his instincts won			0
the game was enriched by his decision			0
@entity194 conjure their own tales of the unexpected @entity194 believe that @entity196 tried to discover their starting line - up at least a day before the teams met in @entity194 on april 5			1
in a furious letter to the @entity200 , they claim that this constituted ‘ an attempt to obtain a sporting advantage ’			0
they note that ‘ @entity196 succeeded in their efforts and achieved an unexpected 3 - 0 win ’			1
and they reflect : ‘ we will never know the extent to which the confidential information affected the outcome of the match			2
’ personally , i have n’t the faintest idea if their complaint is well - founded			2
but i do wonder why anybody should take great risks in order to win ‘ a sporting advantage ’ over @entity194			2
i marvel at the suggestion that advance knowledge of the teamsheet could deliver a decisive advantage			0
and i smile at the notion that any away victory in @entity194 could be described as ‘ unexpected ’			0
advantage : @entity196 beat @entity194 3 - 0 in @entity228 at the start of april but if that really is the case , then the @entity200 might scrutinise some of this season ’s other , inexplicable shocks at the @entity234			1
such as @entity235 ( 0 - 1 ) , @entity236 ( 1 - 2 ) , @entity14 ( 0 - 3 ) , @entity237 ( 0 - 3 ) , @entity13 ( 0 - 2 ) , and @entity238 ( 0 - 4 )			1
and i scarcely dare mention @entity239 ( 3 - 6 )			1
for fear of starting a scurrilous rumour			0
it was a lively friday in @entity243 , with a pitch invasion , a barrage of tangerines and tennis balls and the home coach sent off for thumping one of his own substitutes			1
amid all the uproar , @entity243 lost to @entity253 , and now stand on the brink of @entity256 relegation			1
and this at a club that enjoyed a season in the @entity200 just three years ago			2
how has it happened ? the clues may be found on a banner flaunted at the @entity253 game			0
it read ‘ @entity272 ’s @entity271 ’ , and it contrasted the fortunes of the @entity267 family with those of the club they control			0
there is a strong local feeling that the @entity275 have taken a great deal out of the charming old club while giving precious little in return			0
of course , there may be counter-arguments to be made			0
but nobody was listening in @entity243 on friday			1
flashpoint : a tv grab of @entity243 coach @entity285 pushing @entity286 in the face hold up : the match was delayed after fans threw tennis balls and tangerines onto the pitch in protest banner : @entity243 fans protest against owner @entity267 during @entity296 derby @entity297 the week ’s most delicious statistic could be found in a new list of sporting salaries			1
last season , @entity301 won four matches out of 38 and finished bottom of the @entity200 , 14 points from safety			1
by contrast , @entity307 finished third in @entity309 , behind @entity310 and @entity311			1
they also won the @entity313			0
crazy : @entity307 's title - chasing stars were paid less last year than @entity301 yet @entity307 ’s players were paid an average salary of £ 1,734,067 , while their counterparts at @entity301 received an average of £ 2,142,611 — a difference of more than £ 400,000			1
were the high achievers of @entity307 undervalued , or were the non-achievers of @entity301 grotesquely overpaid ? i know what i think .			1

@entity1 stayed on his feet after colliding with @entity19 in the area
the @entity13 player was labelled as naive for not winning a penalty
@entity14 went on to win the match 3 - 1 at the @entity155
@entity243 witnessed chaos with protest and stand - offs on @entity338
@entity301 's relegation side were paid more than @entity307 last season
