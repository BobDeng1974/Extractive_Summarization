@entity0 may be wrestling with a three - way quandary over national allegiance but there is no doubting his commitment to @entity6 , as his wife would confirm			1
on the night of his wedding to @entity9 , back home in @entity11 , @entity12 , the 23 - year - old no 8 wound up in a pub watching his team - mates in action — thousands of miles and many time zones away			1
it may not have made sense to his bride but @entity0 was determined to watch the club that had ignited his career claim their place in the inaugural @entity26			1
he had been given special dispensation to miss the tie against @entity29 in @entity30 last may because of his need to be on the far side of the world			0
‘ before the fixtures came out , we had planned the date for the wedding , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity0 proved his dedication to the club by spending his wedding night watching @entity6 play ‘ when @entity45 ( @entity44 , @entity6 ’ director of rugby ) said we had a game on may 24 , i was a bit nervous about going to ask him if i could miss it			1
‘ i delayed the flight to @entity12 so i could play in the first game , then i went out after that			2
i watched the second game on tv , after the wedding			0
it was about 3am in @entity12 , so i put my missus to bed and said , “ i ’m going to the pub to watch the boys play ”			2
she asked why i did n’t just watch the replay but i said , “ i ca n’t , i have to see it now ”			0
it was the game which decided whether we made it into @entity63 ( @entity26 ) or not , so i had to watch it and i was so pleased we won			0
’ the new elite continental tournament will be a fitting arena for @entity0 to demonstrate his explosive talent and enhance a soaring reputation			2
he is already making waves in the @entity70 , having come to @entity6 from @entity71 as a relative unknown			1
the 23 - year - old scored a try for @entity6 during the season opening defeat to @entity77 at @entity78 @entity44 signed the raw lock - cum - flanker on a hunch , switched him to no 8 and soon found he had a barnstorming replacement for @entity83 , who had moved to @entity77			1
@entity0 has been a potent threat to opposition defences with his ball - carrying , off - loading , try - scoring routine , as he demonstrated last saturday by touching down during a sensational performance at @entity78			1
yet hockey was his childhood sport and , remarkably , he did not play in a rugby match until six years ago			1
when he gave it a go , the results were immediate			0
‘ i started playing hockey aged five and switched to rugby when i was 17 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ at my school in @entity12 , we were doing hockey training one day and the rugby coach asked if i wanted to play against a team coming from @entity100 because he did n’t have any locks			1
the @entity12 born no 8 impressed during his debut season in the @entity70 for @entity6 last year ‘ i said i did n’t know any rules and all he said was , “ catch the ball , run it straight and if you see an opposition player with the ball , tackle him ”			1
the week after , we played against the school from @entity100 — @entity112			0
@entity111 sent some scouts out and they were impressed with the way i played			0
‘ that was my first - ever game of rugby			2
after the game , our coach called me over and the guy ( scout ) from @entity100 gave me an envelope			0
when i went home , i opened the envelope and it said , “ 2010 scholarship for @entity127 ”			0
i told my dad and he just said , “ you do n’t even play rugby ”			2
but i showed him all the papers they gave me and he was so surprised			0
’ one game had brought one big breakthrough and @entity0 continued to make rapid progress , from the @entity112 1st xv into the @entity71 academy and on into the senior squad to play in the domestic @entity138			1
he was also called up for the @entity140 squad but held off from accepting while he awaited a @entity142 contract			0
that next step up eluded him , so despite being eligible to chase @entity145 selection after three years ’ residency , he explored options abroad and @entity6 took a chance on him			1
his impact has been so eye - catching that there is now a tussle for his @entity153 services			0
@entity12 and @entity154 see him as a potential asset at next year ’s @entity156 and @entity157 are monitoring his development			1
@entity0 is eligible to play for @entity12 , @entity154 and could turn out for @entity157 in two years time @entity0 will qualify to wear the @entity159 in 2016 and while he is non-committal for now , it seems he is leaning towards that target			1
‘ people have been saying , “ i think @entity12 want you , i think @entity154 want you ” , ’ he said			1
‘ but they have n’t approached me face to face			0
the @entity12 coach did call to ask if i wanted to play in the summer but i said i could n’t because i was getting married			2
‘ my mum is @entity154 - @entity167 and my dad is part @entity154 , part @entity12 , so i am majority @entity154 but i was born in @entity12 and grew up there			1
i love both countries but it ’s about taking my time to make the right decision			0
‘ i do n’t want to make a decision and then regret it later			0
there are two options and once i qualify ( for @entity157 ) on residency , there will be three			2
i have n’t heard from @entity157 but , if they want me , i have to keep working on my game			2
’ on sunday afternoon at @entity183 , @entity0 has a prime opportunity to highlight his test credentials when @entity6 face champions @entity186 and their outstanding no 8 , @entity189			1
the @entity190 is from a @entity192 family , with body art depicting their journey to @entity196			0
@entity0 is also proud of his @entity198 heritage and wears the ink to prove it , along with a wedding tattoo			2
‘ the one on the right arm , which goes to my back , is a map of @entity12 , to show where i come from , ’ he said			2
‘ on my left arm , the turtle symbolises myself and where i ’m from			0
the tulip is the @entity209 flower , so it symbolises my wife — who was born in @entity100 , but her family are @entity209			0
the design on the left represents the wedding			0
most people have a wedding ring but i ’ve got a wedding tattoo instead			0

23 - year - old @entity6 number 8 signed for the @entity220 in 2013
@entity0 could represent @entity12 , @entity154 or even @entity157 in two years
the former @entity71 no 8 *'s* first rugby match was six years ago
