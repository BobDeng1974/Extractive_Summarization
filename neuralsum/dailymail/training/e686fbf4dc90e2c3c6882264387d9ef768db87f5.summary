@entity0 joked last night that in some parts of @entity2 buying a property for more than the proposed £ 2million mansion tax threshold would probably only stretch to a garage			1
but in fact it can secure a mansion in less fashionable parts of the capital and something even grander outside @entity2 - usually with a swimming pool , huge drive and extensive grounds			1
nevertheless the singer humiliated @entity16 after she unceremoniously took him to task over @entity19 ’s contentious policy , which would probably hit his own house in north @entity2			1
appearing on @entity23 ’s @entity22 , miss @entity0 told him : ‘ for me , it ’s so disturbing – the name in its own right : “ mansion tax ”			1
tv viewers provided a running commentary on @entity55 , describing how the singer was ‘ doing a @entity56 ’ and ‘ wiping the floor ’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister			0
mr @entity16 tried to defend his policy but looked lost and bewildered as the former @entity63 singer tore into his pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
but @entity19 ’s shadow work and pensions secretary @entity67 slammed the singer ’s claim that £ 2million would only get you a garage in the capital			1
she told @entity75 radio : ‘ look the mansion tax and what she said on the mansion tax – that you can only get a garage in @entity2 for £ 2million – that is absolutely wrong			1
‘ my family have lived in @entity2 for all of my life and for generations and you can certainly get more than a garage for £ 2million			2
i would say , what planet is she on ? however , the singer is right about garages being expensive , because last month one in @entity92 sold for an eye - watering £ 550,000			1
overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in @entity2 and the @entity97 – will be caught by the tax			1
this is what £ 2million can buy you : in @entity103 a four - bedroom terraced property was on sale for £ 2,000,000			2
a similar house on the same street sold for £ 430,000 in 1999 , and is now estimated to be worth £ 2,036,764			2
a four - bedroom semi-detached riverside home in @entity109 , @entity110 , was being sold with a guide price of £ 2,000,000 , in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years			0
just outside @entity115 , a four - bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £ 2,100,000			0
the property , which was completely rebuilt in 1999 , boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design			0
other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year			0
in @entity130 , semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city , where homes sold for around £ 400,000 in the mid- 90s , are on sale for more than £ 2million			0
@entity132 chairman @entity131 has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value			1
this six - bedroom detached house in @entity141 , @entity138 is on sale for £ 2million , and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room			0
average prices on the street currently stand at £ 910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago			0
a neighbouring ten - bedroom property sold for £ 2million in 2005 , and is now thought to be worth £ 2,152,966			0
a guide price of £ 2,095,000 would buy this four - bedroom farmhouse near @entity151 , @entity152 , which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa			2
homes in the area sell for an average of £ 962,016 , an increase of 12 per cent from 2009			0
critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued , which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost			0
offers of around £ 2million are being taken for a four - bedroom farmhouse near @entity173 in @entity174 , an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009			0
it could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the @entity178 , and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky - rocketed and who now have a low - income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax			1
a three - bedroom detached house in @entity188 , outside @entity189 is on sale for £ 2.2m			0
there are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value , having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry			1
and for £ 550,000 ...			2
this dilapidated old shed , which doubled for a garage , in @entity92 , has been snapped up for £ 550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer			2

@entity16 *quizzed* by @entity0 over @entity19 ’s £ 2m mansion tax plan
@entity207 said : ' have you seen what that money can get you ? it ’s a garage '
in fact it can get you something *substantial* - but a garage can be £ 550,000
shadow minister @entity67 attacks claim £ 2m can only buy ' garage '
the @entity19 mp says @entity0 is wrong , adding : ' what planet is she on ? '
estimated that 108,000 homes – most in @entity2 - will be caught by the tax
@entity227 said today that @entity178 needs the tax : ' @entity229 ' - a *reference* to @entity63 's *biggest* hit song
