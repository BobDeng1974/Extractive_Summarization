by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 22:16 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 22:17 est , 11 september 2013 if members of @entity4 want to know how much a military strike on @entity6 will cost , they 'll have to wing it			1
the @entity8 , a nonpartisan has written on monday that it 's not capable of forecasting the price tag on what secretary of state @entity11 has called an ' unbelievably small and limited ' attack on sites related to dictator @entity16 's chemical weapons stockpiles			1
that declaration was published on monday , hours before president @entity17 changed tack in a series of television news interviews that were expected to be rallying cries for war powers but instead became diplomatic dog - whistles			0
the turnaround followed an international flurry prompted by @entity11 's gaffe - induced suggestion that @entity16 could avoid a military attack from the @entity29 if he agreed to quickly turn his chemical weapons over to international control for destruction			1
war powers : the @entity35 pilotless drone combat aircraft carries laser - guided bombs and can fly faster than 500 miles per hour at 40,000 feet			0
the @entity37 has spent an estimated $ 1.8 billion on research , development and testing warbucks : a single sea - launched tomahawk missile can cost upwards of $ 1.4 million war drone : the @entity47 @entity46 unmanned aerial vehicle carries an estimated price tag of $ 4 million , not including each $ 58,000 hellfire anti-armor missile in its airborne arsenal war winner : @entity6 president @entity16 stands to lose much of his chemical weapons stockpiles but will likely remain in power , fighting his civil war with conventional weapons sent from @entity56 by the boatload more than a week ago @entity17 proposed @entity58 21 , a measure that @entity60 have put on a temporary back - burner while a surprising @entity56 - brokered diplomatic solution plods its way forward			1
it would authorize the @entity65 to attack @entity6 sites if the president determined it is in @entity29 's national interest			2
' i will not pursue an open - ended action like @entity72 or @entity73 ' against @entity16 , @entity17 pledged in a televised national address on tuesday			0
but without specifics , @entity8 declared on monday , the price tag remains open - ended			2
' the @entity77 has not detailed how it would use the authority that would be provided by this resolution , ' read @entity8 's report , a little - noted one - page notice			0
' [ t ] hus , @entity8 has no basis for estimating the costs of implementing @entity85 21			0
' during a sept. 4 hearing in the @entity89 , @entity87 @entity86 rep. @entity86 asked @entity11 to address the potential expenses related to carrying out attacks on @entity6 if @entity4 were to authorize them			2
following through on a use - of - force resolution , she said , ' could potentially cost ... billions			0
' on that same day , three different defense and national security analysts gave @entity96 their ' educated guesswork ' estimates of the cost of a 90 - day military action in @entity6 , a length of time corresponding to the longest period covered in the @entity58 's joint resolution			1
those estimates ranged from $ 5 to $ 21 billion			1
oops : @entity11 's unintentional diplomatic offer to @entity6 on monday in @entity108 singlehandedly shifted the @entity17 administration from an offensive to a defensive posture who stands taller now ? @entity56 president @entity113 ( @entity114 ) is suddenly in the driver 's seat , with @entity17 forced to mute his military threats in favor of a drawn - out and possibly years - long diplomatic process in @entity6 @entity11 is en route to @entity121 , @entity122 for two days of talks with @entity56 foreign minister @entity124			2
the two will reportedly discuss a beginning framework for keeping @entity16 accountable as his chemical arms are slowly dismantled they were based on a scenario that required providing @entity130 resistance groups with small arms , launching missiles and armed drones from the @entity134 , and flying @entity136 - based military aircraft over @entity6 after chemical weapons launch sites and anti-aircraft positions are destroyed			1
and while both @entity17 and @entity11 have insisted that any @entity29 plan would not involve ' boots on the ground , ' a 2012 @entity37 estimate prepared for the @entity65 's @entity144 found that securing @entity16 's chemical weapons themselves would require 75,000 ground troops			1
that scenario is decidedly on hold while @entity6 explores diplomatic options with @entity56 , its strongest ally			0
a @entity37 spokesman told @entity152 in 2012 that it costs $ 815,000 per year to pay , deploy , feed , house , arm and maintain each soldier on the ground in @entity73			0
applying that figure to the 75,000 troops the @entity37 has said it would need to secure @entity6 chemical weapons sites , a three - month deployment at similar costs would cost another $ 15.27 billion			1
@entity17 asked @entity4 on tuesday night to keep his war - powers resolution open as a viable future option , calling on legislators to ' postpone , ' not cancel , a scheduled vote in the @entity58			0
if the measure should win future approval and the president wanted to launch a strike , @entity8 notes , he ' would be required to provide a determination to the @entity4 addressing several criteria to show that such action is necessary and in the national interest			0
' ' in addition , it would require the president to submit to the @entity4 a strategy for negotiating a political settlement to the @entity6 conflict , a comprehensive review of @entity182 towards @entity6 , and periodic reports on the progress of military operations			2

@entity4 ' *economic* forecasters have written that they ca *n't* forecast how many billions of dollars a @entity6 military campaign might consume
experts tell @entity96 that a 90 - day mission , if needed , could carry a price tag as large as $ 21 billion
adding ' boots on the ground ' *sufficient* to secure @entity16 's chemical weapons could add another $ 15 billion in personnel costs
