it is one of the country 's most recognizable sights and a building synonymous with @entity6 democracy			0
now a stunning new timelapse video has put a new twist on the famous view of @entity10 's @entity11 - showing the landmark as it is dressed from top to bottom in scaffolding for its first renovation in more than 50 years			1
the hugely complicated project involves removing several floral displays and pillars to be taken away for repair , while the 290ft high dome will be made watertight and 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell repaired			2
mostly undertaken at night , the scaffolding work continues to build up around the building until it reaches the @entity38 at its peak			2
the footage is made all the more spectacular by the 720 @entity42 construction lights installed for contractors to continue working on the job throughout the night			0
building work is expected to continue for two years , with much of it carried out on nights and weekends to minimize disruptions to @entity49 and sightseeing tours			1
it is hoped the $ 60million project will preserve the building for future generations , as well as water proofing it following damage caused by roosting birds			0
the cornerstone of the building was laid in 1793 by @entity60 himself and was then worked on by doctor and part - time architect @entity63 who placed a shallow dome between the @entity66 wing and the @entity68 wing			1
scaffolding surrounds the bottom of the building as workers begin preparing for the renovations illuminated by hundreds of lights , it continues building up around the entirety of the 290ft high building it finishes only when it has surrounded the building and reaches the @entity38 at the dome 's peak construction then crawled along under the watchful eye of several different architects before much of their work was undone by @entity88 soldiers in 1814 who set fire to both the @entity11 building and the @entity92			1
fortunately a rain storm stopped the building from being completely destroyed and construction was eventually ' finished ' in 1826			0
building work continued to enlarge the @entity11 from 1850 and it was architect @entity98 who designed the cast iron dome to sit between new enlarged chambers , with work finishing in 1868 .			0

video shows dome as it *undergoes* first renovation in more than 50 years
the @entity10 landmark is worked on mostly at nights and weekends
led lights illuminate it as workers erect hundreds of meters of scaffolding
