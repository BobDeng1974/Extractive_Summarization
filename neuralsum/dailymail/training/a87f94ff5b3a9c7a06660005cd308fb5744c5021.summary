they are among the most fearsome creatures on earth , but this killer shark looks as though it is flashing a massive grin as it comes face - to - face with a daring photographer			2
far from trying to rip 26 - year - old cameraman @entity8 to shreds with its deadly knashers , it instead appears to pull a series of poses which reveal a somewhat friendlier side			1
incredibly , the stunning pictures were taken my mr @entity8 without the safety of a protective cage			1
jaws - dropping : a fearsome shark gets up close and personal with cameraman @entity8 - and appears to flash him a grin smile ! the deadly creature flashes his pearly whites as snapper @entity8 tries his luck and gets ever closer @entity27 : the shark strikes another grin for the cameras and is photobombed by a friend the aquarist at @entity33 went under water with his friends at @entity36 in the @entity37 to get the incredible images			1
the area is a hotspot for tiger sharks , as well as species such as lemon shark and reef shark , allowing the divers to get up close and personal with the potentially dangerous animals			1
mr @entity8 , from @entity33 , @entity47 , said : ' i 've always loved the ocean since i was a child			1
i think most children start out with a love of sharks , dinosaurs and outer space - i just never grew out of it			2
' i have been diving for 14 years now and most of that time has been spent in search of sharks			2
' this location north of @entity60 , @entity61 , is an incredible area with relatively untouched coral reefs and some of the healthiest shark populations on the planet			1
daring : @entity8 got so close to the sharks he was able to touch them fearless : @entity8 , from @entity33 , @entity47 , opted to go underwater without any protection from a cage surrounded : @entity8 is circled by three sharks hut is unmoved as he continues to take his incredible pictures ' sharing the water with such an immense and powerful creature is thrilling for sure but the experience is so much more than that			1
' i feel completely calm and at peace in these situations			2
sharks are amazingly deliberate and cautious in their movements and though a highly instinctual animal they still display curiosity with regard to the novelties in their world			2
' eye contact is an important part of being in close quarters with large sharks , when you break your gaze , they often decide it 's safe to move a little closer			1
' so to capture these moments with my camera and share them with the world in hope of possibly breaking some negative stereotypes , that is the payoff for me			0
' and if i can play some minuscule role in preventing a species from going extinct in my lifetime then that is my purpose			0
' @entity8 argues that while activist groups , film makers and photographers are turning the tide in shark conservation , there is still more that needs to be done to protect them			1
that 's more like it : this shark strikes a more traditional pose razor sharp : these teeth could do some serious damage but @entity8 was undeterred endangered : some shark species have dropped by up to 90 per cent under threat : every year between 20 and 100 million sharks are killed by fishing activity he added : ' people flock from around the world to see @entity128 lions in their natural environment , however , none dare to leave the relative safety of the safari vehicle			1
' this is of course due to an innate respect for the apex predator of the ecosystem			0
thousands of people interact with sharks everyday unprotected , without incident			0
' @entity140 are often revered and respected as beautiful creatures , iconic to the continent of @entity128			0
as the apex predators of the ocean , sharks should be regarded with the same esteem			0
' every year between 20 and 100 million sharks are killed from fishing activity			0
as many species are slow to mature and may only produce one pup a year it does n't bode well for long term population			0
' some species ' populations have dropped 50 - 90 % but in recent years many people have become aware of the plight that sharks face with regard to the fining industry and over fishing in general			0
' although the numbers are quite grim - i still have hope that it 's not too late			0

fearless @entity8 got up close and personal with fish in the @entity37
he went underwater without any protection in order to get the incredible snaps
