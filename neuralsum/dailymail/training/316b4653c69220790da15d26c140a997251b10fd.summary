solitude : @entity1 in the @entity3 film @entity2 the biggest problem facing those cast adrift on the open seas is succinctly summed up by @entity6 in his poem @entity7 : ‘ water , water , everywhere , nor any drop to drink			2
’ a human being can survive for around three weeks without food if they have water , but will perish after just three to five days without fluids			2
in the absence of drinking water , a man who was last week washed up on the shores of a remote @entity20 after surviving on his tiny , broken - down boat for an astonishing 13 months , kept himself alive by a means not available to @entity6 ’s cursed seamen — he drank turtle blood			1
@entity24 left his native @entity25 on christmas day 2012 for a short shark - fishing trip to @entity27 with a companion			1
but not long after setting sail , disaster struck when the engines of the 24 ft fibreglass boat lost their propellers			1
the two men were left to the mercy of the ocean currents , which proceeded to sweep the boat 8,000 miles west to the @entity38 — a former @entity40 territory halfway between @entity41 and @entity42 , and one of the most isolated spots on the planet			1
@entity24 ’s companion died several months ago , leaving him to eke out a desperate living alone , drinking rainwater when it was available and feeding off passing birds , fish and turtles , which he caught and tore apart with his bare hands ( no fishing rods were found on his boat )			1
when it did n’t rain , @entity24 was forced to drink turtle blood			1
it is rich in iron and proteins , and provides the same sort of nutrition as steak and eggs			2
it also provides a measure of rehydration , though not as effectively as rainwater			2
discovery : two @entity38 islanders stumbled upon the man - half - starved , with long hair and an unkempt beard - and his boat last thursday , after the tides miraculously deposited them on a coral reef at @entity77 ( pictured ) it ’s not known if he ate the turtles ’ eyes , but experts advise they are the most fluid - rich part of the reptile ’s body			1
when @entity24 , whose ordeal has parallels with the @entity1 film @entity2 , was eventually discovered , there was a turtle lurking in the hold of his battered boat			1
two @entity38 islanders stumbled upon him — half - starved , with long hair and an unkempt beard — and his boat last thursday , after the tides miraculously deposited them on a coral reef at @entity77			1
severely sunburnt , dehydrated and emaciated , @entity24 was first cared for at a government property , where he was fed and rehydrated			1
because he did n’t speak @entity98 — and none of the 700 islanders spoke @entity101 — he had to use drawings and gestures to explain his astonishing story to the mayor , @entity105			2
mr @entity106 said : ‘ we ’ve been feeding him nutritious island food and he ’s getting better			2
he has pain in both knees			2
otherwise , he ’s ok			2
’ @entity24 also has low blood pressure , but there seems to be no sign of any long - lasting physical effects of the ordeal , even after spending so long at sea			1
this morning , he is due to arrive at @entity117 , the capital of the @entity38			1
in a cruel irony , the archipelago ’s only plane capable of landing on @entity77 is undergoing maintenance , so @entity24 is having to travel by boat			1
one can only imagine his thoughts at being on the ocean again			0
‘ i just want to get back home to @entity25 , but i do n’t even know where i am — i ’m tired and sad , ’ said @entity24 , on a crackly phoneline from the @entity38 at the weekend			1
‘ i ’m desperate and i want to get back to @entity25 , but i do n’t know how			1
’ then , revealing that he had not lost his sense of humour , he added : ‘ if someone gets me home , i ’m sure my boss will pay			1
’ @entity133 , a @entity134 anthropology student working on @entity77 who spoke to @entity24 , said : ‘ his condition is n’t good , but he ’s getting better			1

but not long after setting sail , disaster struck when the engines of the boat lost their propellers what a research opportunity @entity24 must present to any anthropologist in search of a golden case study			1
for if @entity24 ’s story is true , he is one of the longest surviving castaways in history			1
the physical challenges associated with being adrift at sea are severely testing , but not insuperable			0
in the warm , fertile waters of the @entity20 , there can be food available in the form of turtles and fish , which often congregate near small boats to shelter beneath them			0
they can be caught by hand			0
however , the mental ordeal is , if anything , worse — a debilitating cocktail of despair and delusion brought on by prolonged exposure , starvation and lack of water			0
the victim does not know if they might be found or whether they are facing a lingering death			0
other castaways have died after much shorter times on the open sea			0
in 2012 , two @entity182 fishermen succumbed to heat stroke and dehydration after 28 days			1
when it did n't rain , @entity24 was forced to drink turtle blood			1
it is rich in iron and proteins , and provides the same sort of nutrition as steak and eggs their surviving companion , @entity194 , sued the owners of a passing cruise ship for apparently ignoring their desperate cries a fortnight before he was rescued			0
their tiny 10 ft boat , the @entity201 , was on a short trip from @entity182 to @entity203 when the engine failed and the boat drifted west to the @entity206 , where the lone survivor was picked up			1
the trio ’s problem was n’t food — they still had their fishing nets — but lack of water			2
@entity194 survived only thanks to a providential rain shower when he was at death ’s door			0
in recent years , the closest anyone has come to surviving as long as @entity24 are three other @entity25 , also adrift at sea near the @entity38			1
they survived on fish , birds and rainwater for nine months in 2006 — their mental health was sustained by a copy of the @entity226			0
one survivor , @entity232 , said : ‘ we ate raw seagulls , ducks and fish ; we ate everything raw — any fish that came near the boat , we grabbed it and gulped it down			2
we were able to drink rainwater because it rained every day			0
‘ but twice we almost sank			0
the waves washed into the boat and we thought we were going to die			2
then suddenly we saw ships going by and we ’d reached the other side [ of the @entity20 ]			0
’ one of the most graphic descriptions of a rudderless life at sea comes from @entity246 , who was 18 when he was stranded with his younger siblings — twin boys aged ten — and their parents and a friend in the @entity20 in 1971			0
issue : the biggest problem facing those cast adrift on the open seas is summed up by @entity6 ( pictured ) in his poem @entity7 : ' water , water , everywhere , nor any drop to drink ' his father , @entity258 , was sailing their boat , the @entity261 , from @entity182 to the @entity206 when it was holed by a pod of killer whales			2
after 38 days , the castaways were picked up 300 miles from land by a fishing trawler			1
when the whales struck , the @entity267 took refuge in a life raft , but it deflated after 17 days , forcing them to transfer to an even smaller dinghy			2
they only had six lemons , ten oranges , a tin of biscuits , a bag of onions and half a pound of glucose sweets to sustain them			0
more worryingly , there was only enough water for ten days			0
no one knew they had gone adrift , and sharks staked out their dangerously overcrowded vessel			0
and just like @entity24 , the family depended on turtle blood for survival			1
after their rescue , @entity291 said : ‘ you have to knock it back quickly otherwise it sets into blancmange			0
it has an after - taste that makes you want to retch			0
’ how strong the temptation towards cannibalism must have been for @entity24 when his companion died ; how noble to stick to turtle it helped , too , that his mother , @entity306 , had trained as a nurse			1
she knew about the healing properties of turtle oil ( turtle flesh is rich in it ) , which she rubbed into the painful , saltwater boils that the family developed as a result of constantly sitting in seawater			0
there was only one dry seat in the boat , and the six of them took turns sitting on it			2
crucially , @entity306 was aware of the danger of drinking the fluid at the bottom of the dinghy — a polluted combination of blood , turtle offal and rainwater			0
this would have been poisonous if taken orally , yet taken rectally by enema it would not impair the digestive system			0
@entity306 kept them all hydrated by using an enema tube that they crafted from the rungs of a ladder			0
but at least the poor @entity340 did n’t have to deal with the ultimate castaway horror — cannibalism			0
in 1884 , an @entity98 yacht , @entity344 , set out for @entity345 from @entity346 , but when it capsized in a gale off the @entity349 , the crew took to a lifeboat			0
after 18 days at sea , living off turnips that they ’d salvaged and turtles , two of the starving men resolved to kill and eat another crew member			0
after their rescue , the two men were convicted in a historic legal case ( @entity344 ) , when it was ruled that necessity could be no defence to murder			0
how strong the temptation towards cannibalism must have been for @entity24 when his companion died ; how noble to stick to turtle			1
