for those who suffer from hayfever , the onset of autumn may usually be a great relief			2
but @entity5 scientists fear the season of sneezing and snuffling may be extended , after they found the first signs of pollen from invasive foreign plants			1
common ragweed - a highly allergenic plant which emits a billion pollen grains in a single season - is already the biggest cause of hayfever in the @entity17			1
it invaded the @entity20 mainland in the 1960s - brought over in contaminated seed - and has been spreading north ever since			0
common ragweed is already the biggest cause of hayfever in the @entity24 and now the pollen in being found in @entity26 usually the plant , which grows in late summer and early autumn , would not cope with our chilly september weather			1
but scientists think it has managed to establish itself in the @entity34 thanks to our long and warm summer			1
researchers at the @entity37 , who have been monitoring pollen levels for 40 years , found signs of ragweed pollen on four consecutive days earlier this month			1
on one of the days the ragweed pollen count at their @entity44 recording site reached 38 - a level high enough to cause significant hayfever attacks and problems for asthmatics			1
one in five @entity5 people suffer from hayfever - and another one in 12 have asthma			1
because ragweed is so allergenic - far more than grass - it could become a real health problem if it becomes established			1
it would also extend the hayfever season , which currently ends for most people by early august			1
experts last night warned asthmatics to make sure they have their inhalers with them at all times , given the increased risk			0
@entity66 , lead clinical advisor at @entity34 , said : ‘ the milder weather and presence of ragweed pollen may now result in a longer pollen season this year which will cause misery for people with asthma and hay fever in the @entity34			1
‘ the 79 per cent of people with asthma who find that pollen makes their symptoms worse may also be at an increased risk of a potentially life threatening asthma attack			1
’ @entity82 dr @entity81 , who led the research in @entity84 , said the plant - which grows up to three feet in height - had probably come into @entity5 in birdseed imported from @entity88 or the @entity17			1
she said isolated cases of ragweed had been reported before in @entity5 , particularly on the south coast - but they had never become established and had never created a pollen problem before			1
but because of the mild autumn , she fears ragweed may have enough time to grow sufficiently to survive the winter - and may be a real problem next year			2
she said : ‘ ragweed ca n’t survive [ here ] because of our cooler climate compared to @entity24 and @entity88 , so we were very surprised to see it when we analysed the pollen and fungi in the air earlier this month			2
‘ whether or not we continue to see more ragweed will very much depend on how mild this autumn is and when we have the first frost			0
if it is a late frost , it is likely that ragweed levels may increase this time next year			0
one in five @entity5 people suffer from hayfever - and another one in 12 have asthma ‘ @entity113 counts change on a daily basis and seasonally			2
it is really important to monitor pollen levels in the air to inform treatment for the millions of hayfever and asthma sufferers in the country			1
it can also be used as an indicator of climate change			0
’ dr @entity125 , a plant biologist at the @entity126 in @entity127 , said controls on bird seed are far from rigorous			0
when contaminated seed is put out in bird feeders in the garden , some may drop out and germinate in the soil below			0
‘ this is mainly a problem of sunflower seed imports , ’ he said			0
‘ this grows as a weed among sunflowers in the @entity17 - and controls on bird seed are far less stringent than for plant seed			2
‘ this has certainly been the year for ragweed to establish itself , if that is what it has done - this late summer spell of good weather is perfect for it			0
‘ however , this could be a case of airborne pollen coming over from @entity153			0
it has been spreading through central and northern @entity153 for some time - the right wind and some settled weather could explain why it is being picked up in the @entity44			0
’ dr @entity158 , director of the @entity159 , said there is a chance the seeds could have been carried to the @entity34 by birds			2
‘ the ragweed fruit - which encases the seed - has wings and spines that can become attached to animals and birds			0
‘ that is the most probable cause			0
but whatever had caused this , it is very unusual to see this level of ragweed pollen			2
‘ the source is clearly local to the @entity44 - these levels suggest a number of plants have become established in the recent past			0

common ragweed is already the biggest cause of hayfever in the @entity17
highly allergenic pollen from the plants has been found in @entity26
@entity37 researchers fear hayfever season will be extended
@entity66 from asthma @entity34 said this will cause misery for many
