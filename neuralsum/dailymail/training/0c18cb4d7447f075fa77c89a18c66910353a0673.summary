beaming with excitement , this is the moment @entity3 was able to ride a bicycle for the first time thanks to generous donations from @entity8 readers			1
the two - year - old , who has a form of cerebral palsy after being born prematurely , will use the specially - adapted bicycle to strengthen her legs ahead of surgery to enable her to walk			1
readers gave more than £ 55,000 to help the two - year - old earlier this year after the @entity8 reported she had been denied @entity18 funding for the operation - by the same hospital trust which paid for breast enlargement surgery for an aspiring glamour model			1
@entity3 , two , was able to ride a bicycle for the first time thanks to donations from @entity8 readers @entity3 ’s spastic diplegia means she can not stand and instead shuffles around on her knees			1
she is only able to take a few steps with the aid of a frame and can not play outside with her friends			0
her family , from @entity33 , @entity34 , bought the £ 1,200 bicycle using some of the donations after her physiotherapist recommended it to prepare her for surgery			1
@entity3 ’s mother , former nurse @entity39 , 40 , said it was ‘ life changing ’			2
she said : ‘ just using it means @entity3 ’s doing things and seeing things she ’s not seen before because she ’s always been strapped up in a wheelchair			1
‘ it has given her the opportunity to use her legs and so much more independence			0
the two - year - old , who has a form of cerebral palsy after being born prematurely , will use the specially - adapted bicycle to strengthen her legs before surgery ‘ she can go out with other children now when they ’re playing in the street , instead of having to sit in her chair waving at them			1
’ mrs @entity3 said she and husband @entity61 , 44 , would have had to save ‘ for a long time ’ to buy the bicycle without the donations			1
‘ being able to give @entity3 this bit of independence has entirely been down to the generosity of @entity8 readers , ’ she added			2
‘ they have given her wheels and started her on a journey where hopefully the next step will be walking			0
’ @entity3 ’s brother @entity72 , 14 , said : ‘ i ’m just glad my sister can go out on her bike with me now			2
we are going to go to the park together			0

despite having raised more than £ 58,000 in total , @entity3 ’s family faced another blow in may when doctors at @entity91 said she was n’t eligible for surgery as her condition was ‘ not severe enough yet ’			1
they now must find another £ 17,000 to take her to the @entity94 for the selective dorsal rhizotomy operation on her spine which should enable her to walk			1
the bicycle is made by special needs equipment company , @entity98 , and can be adapted as @entity3 grows to give her several years of use doctors at @entity91 said @entity3 was not eligible for surgery in may as her condition was ‘ not severe enough yet ’ an anonymous donor has already pledged free flights for the family to travel to @entity104 in @entity105 when they get the go - ahead from dr @entity107 , the @entity94 surgeon who pioneered the procedure			1
funds permitting , @entity3 could have the operation next year when she is three			2
with intensive physiotherapy , she could be walking by five			0
the @entity114 are raising money through the charity tree of @entity117 and any excess will go towards helping other disabled children			0
to donate to @entity3 ’s surgery fund visit : www.justgiving.com/sophies-tiny-steps			2
@entity122 is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity ( increased muscle tone ) in the lower limbs			0
the lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system			0
these neurones ( bundles of nerve fibres ) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body			0
electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves			0
this process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut			0
due to the size of the nerves and rootlets , this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic			0
many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs .			2
