by @entity0 last updated at 3:00 pm on 15th november 2011 a woman blighted by a severe food intolerance which restricted her to a rice - only diet is preparing for her first @entity5 dinner in over a decade			1
former caterer @entity6 , 53 , lost 3st as her body started violently reacting to foods that included dairy , gluten , wheat , sugars , oils and fats			1
she used to enjoy fried breakfasts , curries and roast dinners but was limited to bowls of boiled rice following physical reactions to nearly everything she ate			0
no pain with grain : @entity6 , 53 , used to survive on a daily diet of rice because she was allergic to almost all other foods her unusual condition had left dieticians , gastroenterologists and even neurologists baffled			1
with no solution she was forced to give up her job and became housebound as her condition took control , leaving her husband @entity36 increasingly concerned			0
for the past twelve @entity37 she had to watch as her family tucked into their roast dinners while she sat with a portion of bland rice			0
she told @entity43 : ' every year my condition got worse			0
the first year it was @entity5 pudding that i could n't handle and last christmas i could only manage one sprout			1
' mrs @entity6 is preparing for her first @entity5 dinner in over a decade following a nutritionist 's recommendation but in a dramatic turnaround the mother - of - two , from @entity54 , @entity52 has overcome her debilitating illness which began in 1999			1
after her story gained publicity earlier this year clinical nutritionist @entity57 got in touch via @entity61 and suggested she should try slowly introducing new foods into her diet , and now mrs @entity6 is able to tolerate 40 different foods			1
mrs @entity6 said : ‘ when @entity57 got in touch , i thought it was worth a try , i 'd tried everything else			0
’ mrs @entity6 is now on the hunt for a suitable stuffing recipe following the new diet plan she started by consuming nothing but clear meat broth , made from boiled chicken carcasses which contained only 10 to 14 calories per dish			1
eventually she was able to introduce stand - alone dishes , such as omelets and lamb chops , as her body built up resistance			2
now miraculously she is busy gearing up for her @entity5 dinner which she will spend with her husband @entity36 and eldest son @entity83 , 34			1
she said : ' i did n't believe this would ever be able to happen , i 'm really looking for to people coming around and enjoying food again			2
' we are planning on having turkey , sprouts , carrots , green beans , parsnips and potatoes , which will be cooked in goose grease , as this is an oil i can tolerate			2
' unfortunately there will be no mince pies or @entity5 pudding but i might be able to manage some banana and coconut milk			2
' she is also on the hunt for a stuffing recipe that will adhere to her dietary needs			2
' there is a local organic farm nearby and i 'm hoping they can make me up a special recipe			0
' they have gluten free sausage meat and i 'm hoping they can combine it with chestnuts			0
' prolonged migraines , sickness , diarrhoea and joint pains were all symptoms caused by the allergy that remains undiagnosed			0
a number of surveys have found that 20 to 30 per cent of people in the @entity125 now claim to have a food allergy			0
mrs @entity6 added : ' i really did n't think i would be eating @entity5 dinner , but now it 's mid november it really seems like a reality			1
but i still have a long way to go			0
