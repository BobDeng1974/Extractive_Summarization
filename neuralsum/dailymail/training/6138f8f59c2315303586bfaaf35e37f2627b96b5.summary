this chilling series of images give an alarming projection of how some of @entity5 ’s most famous tourism destinations could look in the future if scientists predictions about the effects of global warming prove correct			1
@entity11 - based researcher and artist @entity10 , 24 , has created the shocking photo illustrations which show many of @entity5 ’s most iconic destinations including the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 ’s @entity17 submerged in up to 25 feet of water			1
it could take several centuries for sea levels to rise to that level but @entity10 hopes his work will raise public awareness about the very real threat of global warming today , reports @entity28			1
popular tourist destination : the art deco district of @entity31 in @entity32 as it looks today submerged city : in centuries to come @entity31 could be submerged in 25 feet of water according to global warming projections the @entity15 on the @entity37 in @entity38 , built to commemorate @entity39 , is one of the @entity5 's most popular tourist destinations in the centuries to come the @entity15 could be surrounded by water if sea levels rise by 25 feet @entity46 is another area which could be significantly impacted by rising sea levels , these images show the harbor today , left , and then under 25ft of water , right according to the @entity5 national climate assessment , a congressionally mandated study released earlier this year , the consequences of climate change are now hitting the @entity5 on several fronts , including health , infrastructure , water supply , agriculture and especially more frequent severe weather			1
the report claims observable change to the climate in the past half - century ‘ is due primarily to human activities , predominantly the burning of fossil fuel , ’ and that no areas of the @entity5 are immune to change			0
‘ corn producers in @entity69 , oyster growers in @entity71 , and maple syrup producers in @entity73 have observed changes in their local climate that are outside of their experience , ’ the report said			0
months after @entity78 hurtled into the @entity5 @entity79 , causing billions of dollars in damage , the report concluded that severe weather was now the new normal			1
‘ certain types of weather events have become more frequent and / or intense , including heat waves , heavy downpours , and , in some regions , floods and droughts , ’ the report said			2
this series of images show how the @entity16 might be impacted by rising sea levels , left , as it is today and then right , after an increase in sea level of five feet left , how the @entity16 could look in 2300 when sea levels may have risen to 12 feet , then after levels have increased 25 feet in several centuries holiday hotspot : @entity17 in @entity32 as it looks today @entity17 in @entity32 could be totally submerged in the future if the sea levels rise 25 feet last year was the hottest year ever in the @entity5			1
according to the @entity101 , the seas will rise by an average of 6.6 feet by 2100			0
then over the coming centuries , as temperatures rise and ice sheets melt , the oceans could rise as much as 20 or 30 feet			0
@entity10 has created images which show how famous landmarks could look like under 5 feet ( projected increase over the next 100 to 300 years ) , 12 feet ( potential level in 2300 ) , and 25 feet ( the potential level in coming centuries ) of water			2
the @entity5 national climate assessment report notes that of an increase in average @entity5 temperatures of about 1.5 degrees f since 1895 , when reliable national record - keeping began , more than 80 percent had occurred in the past three decades			0
with heat - trapping gases already in the atmosphere , temperatures could rise by a further 2 to 4 degrees f in most parts of the country over the next few decades , the report said			0
the @entity125 in @entity38 is a presidential memorial dedicated to @entity127 the @entity125 could be almost totally submerged if sea levels rise by 25 feet these maps show @entity10 's projections for which areas of @entity132 and @entity133 would become submerged if sea level rose 25 feet , right , compared to now , left certain positive consequences of rising temperatures , such as a longer growing season , were said to be offset by more disruptive impacts , including : ‘ this draft report sends a warning to all of us : we must act in a comprehensive fashion to reduce carbon pollution or expose our people and communities to continuing devastation from extreme weather events and their aftermath , ’ senator @entity139 , a @entity141 @entity140 who heads the @entity143 environment committee , said in a statement			1
some @entity155 hope president @entity156 will use his executive powers to clamp down further on some carbon - polluting industries			0
@entity156 has cited climate change as a priority since being re-elected in november , although many @entity162 lawmakers are wary of declaring a definitive link between human activity and evidence of a changing climate			0
some of the best - preserved examples of 19th - century urban design in the @entity5 are found in the @entity170 neighborhood of @entity46 how the rows of @entity173 brownstone homes might look if water levels increase by 25 feet @entity175 , the private @entity176 research university in @entity177 , @entity178 as it looks today how @entity175 might look under 25 feet of water			2

in a *bid* to raise public awareness about global warming , an artist has created a shocking series of image
@entity10 's photo illustrations show many of @entity5 's most iconic destinations under up to 25 feet of water
months after @entity78 , a recent study has concluded that severe weather is now the new normal
last year was the hottest year ever in the @entity5
threats to human health from increased extreme weather events , *wildfires* and air pollution , as well as *diseases* *spread* by *insects* and through food and water ;
less reliable water supply , and the potential for water rights to become a hot - button legal issue ;
more *vulnerable* infrastructure due to sea - level rise , bigger storm surges , heavy downpours and extreme heat ;
warmer and more *acidic* oceans .
