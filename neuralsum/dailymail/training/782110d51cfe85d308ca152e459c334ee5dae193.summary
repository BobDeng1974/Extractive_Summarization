by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:07 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 08:36 est , 4 october 2012 first came the low , cultured hum of the @entity4 racing car engine ; then rolling thunder as the rocket fired up			1
a plume of flame shot out for ten seconds and the roar at the nozzle reached an estimated 186 decibels – louder than a @entity12 at take off			1
indeed , the racket from the rocket was later claimed to be the loudest man - made noise anywhere in the world			1
such is the awesome power of the @entity20 supercar which aims to shatter the land speed record next year			2
at 12 feet long , 18 inches in diameter and weighing just under 1,000lb , the rocket is the largest of its kind ever designed in @entity48 and was the biggest to be fired in the @entity20 for 20 years			1
yesterday , it was bolted to the floor for the test in a bomb - proof hangar at @entity53 , @entity24 , and was only operating at half capacity			1
but next year , if all goes well when it is fitted inside the £ 10million car , the rocket will send the gleaming orange and blue machine racing to 1,050mph			1
in the hangar it was surrounded by a ‘ water deluge system ’ in case it exploded and concrete blocks separated it from other parts of the engine			0
‘ if it blows up , at least we ’ll save something , ’ said one engineer			0
guests were invited to watch via a video link in a nearby hangar and around 120,000 people around the globe viewed it online			0
the rocket is seen here with the ' @entity33 ' sign on the side moments before the test in its ultimate form the rocket will generate around 27,500lb of thrust – equivalent to about 80,000 horsepower , the combined output of 95 @entity4 cars			0
earplugs were available yesterday , a wise precaution given that the rock concert said to be the loudest ever – a 1976 show by @entity92 – reached a mere 126 decibels			0
the assault on the record is due to take place in the @entity97 desert at @entity98 , the site in 1929 of one of sir @entity102 ’s many attempts			2
if @entity35 succeeds , it will reach 1.4 times the speed of sound – fast enough to get from @entity105 to @entity106 in 51 minutes			0
it would also see @entity109 pilot @entity108 , 50 , who will drive @entity35 , smash his existing land speed record by more than 200mph and become the first man to drive through the 1,000mph barrier			2
should the target of 1,050mph be reached , it will also beat the low - altitude speed record for aircraft of 994mph			1
mr @entity108 described what he faces at the controls : ‘ 2g acceleration , then 3g deceleration			0
@entity121 is the equivalent of 0 to 60mph in 1.5 seconds			2
@entity123 is the equivalent of coming to a complete stop from 60mph in one second – what most people would call an average car crash			2
' then all i have to do is control three engines and keep it going in a straight line			0
’ up to a speed of 350mph , it will be powered by a @entity138 jet engine			0
a @entity140 racing car engine is there to pump peroxide fuel into the rocket			2
a catalyst in the rocket then causes a chemical reaction which generates a temperature of @entity148 and the rocket ignites , giving the car the massive boost it needs to hit 1,050mph after 40 seconds			1
then , 3.5 seconds and one mile later , it will start to decelerate			2
project team leader @entity153 said the successful tests were a ‘ major milestone ’			0
a replica version of the @entity35 was also on display at @entity26 near @entity27 , where 400 people gathered to watch the rocket test the bloodhound jet engine that it is hoped will propel the @entity20 car to 1,000mph in 2014 driver wing commander @entity108 , left , defence minister @entity163 , and bloodhound director @entity153 alongside the @entity35 the @entity164 is backing the project , and @entity167 chiefs hope young people will be inspired to get involved in science , technology , mathematics and engineering			1
a team of five @entity175 ( @entity175 ) experts will help build and maintain the car over the next two years in the @entity20 , and be on hand during the record attempts in @entity97 next year and in 2014			1
@entity163 , minister for defence equipment , support and technology , said nurturing engineering skills in youngsters is vital to @entity20 industry , and the project is a good opportunity for the @entity186 to share its experience and skills			0
a soldier cycles past the @entity35 at the @entity191 barracks in central @entity192			0
its rocket engine will be fired for the first time this week the scene at @entity26 near @entity27 , @entity24 where scientists are planning to test fire the first new rocket built in @entity20 for 20 years ‘ that experience will feed directly back into the front line as they progress through their @entity186 careers , ” he said			1
@entity153 , the project director of @entity35 , said : ‘ we are delighted that the @entity164 and @entity175 will be joining us and sharing in this unique adventure			0
‘ their young engineers have great skills and attitude and will make a tremendous contribution to the building and running of the car			1

@entity216 ran *flawlessy* for 20 seconds inside a @entity24 aircraft hanger
the *pencil* - shaped car will be 12ft long and weigh 992lb , and could make its first attempt at the record in 2014
