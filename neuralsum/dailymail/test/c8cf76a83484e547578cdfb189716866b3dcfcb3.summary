the @entity0 have battled to save @entity1 from an alien invasion , the evil @entity3 and now , in the latest movie , face off against the killing machine @entity6			1
they do this , of course , with the help of numerous superpowers - including @entity13 ’s suit , super-healing abilities and @entity16 ’s indestructible shield			1
it looks at the composition of @entity13 's suit - said to be a gold - titanium alloy in one of the movies - and @entity16 's shield			1
the video also explains the science behind super-healing abilities in a video for reactions , the @entity26 took a look at the science of @entity43 's @entity0			1
it begins looking at @entity13 , better known as @entity13 when he dons his iron suit of armour			1
his original suit , made only of iron , would have weighed around 70kg ( 150lbs ) according to the @entity26 - not very comfortable or easy to move around in			1
he later upgrades it to a gold - titanium alloy , but that would actually make things worse explained the video			2
‘ that suit would probably weigh around 160kg ( 350lbs ) , which might work for the @entity55 but not for @entity13 , ’ said the narrator			1
however , dr @entity56 continued that it is later made of a nickel - titanium alloy called nitinol			0
this is ‘ strong but light , and can be reformed after taking damage , ’ she said			0
‘ there may also be some graphite reinforced with carbon fibre , which can take a lot of heat - useful if @entity13 does n’t want to singe his feet using those rocket boots			1
’ @entity13 , better known as @entity13 when he dons his iron suit of armour and played by @entity72 ( pictured ) , made his original suit out of iron			1
he later upgrades it to a gold - titanium alloy , but according to the @entity26 that would be heavy and uncomfortable - perhaps better for the hulk than @entity13 himself none of this would work , though , without @entity13 ’s own portable nuclear power station - the @entity82			1
in @entity84 this uses palladium - but we soon learn this is poisoning and killing the character			0
so instead , he creates a new element - and dr @entity56 said this might not be as far - fetched as it seems			0
he uses his own particle accelerator to smash the nuclei of atoms together and make a new type of atom , which is not entirely dissimilar to the experiments taking place at real - life accelerators such as @entity101			0
‘ scientists have made 20 synthetic elements this way , so it ’s not unbelievable that @entity13 would have made new elements to power his suit , ’ said dr @entity56			2
the main skeleton of @entity110 ; s exoskeleton , shown , is made from high - strength aluminium and steel , and weighs about 95kg ( 209lb ) @entity13 ’s superpowers do n’t stem from a radioactive spider bite or exposure to gamma rays ; they are simply the result of some very clever engineering - and quite a bit of money too			2
it makes sense then that we should try to replicate his powerful suit , and some companies are already coming incredibly close			0
@entity110 , an @entity127 defence contractor , has developed a super-strong robotic exoskeleton for the @entity129			0
soldiers can simply strap into the suit and its high - pressure hydraulic system will enhance their strength , agility and endurance , enabling them to be extremely physically active without risk of exhaustion or injury			2
the current version must be tethered to its power source , an internal combustion hydraulics engine , but an untethered version is expected to be operational by 2020			0
it ’s not just the military that can benefit from exoskeletons , though , as @entity146 has also designed a suit specifically to help workers operate heavy machinery			0
the @entity150 helps to carry the weight of tools , enabling the operator to work for longer between breaks required to recover from muscle fatigue			0
source : how it works issue 72 , ' real - life superpowers ' @entity13 's suit is powered by his famous @entity82 , but in @entity84 , we learn that its palladium fuel source is slowly killing him			1
so instead , @entity13 creates a new element - and this might not be as far - fetched as it seems as it follows somewhat similar principles to those taking place at @entity101 @entity13 is n’t the only one with super-human abilities , though			1
both @entity16 and @entity169 have super strength , quick reflexes - and , most interestingly - the ability to heal quickly			1
‘ in normal healing , a type of white blood cell called a macrophage fights infections and oversees the repair process , ’ explains dr @entity56			0
while this can take two to five days in regular humans , the macrophages of captain @entity127 and @entity169 appear to be super productive , helping them heal even more quickly			0
both @entity16 ( left ) and @entity169 ( right ) have super strength and quick reflexes , while and - most interestingly - the ability to heal quickly			1
this could be due to having advanced macrophages , which let them fight infections and repair their bodies much quicker than us regular humans and @entity16 also has his shield as protection , which can deflect bullets , grenades , lasers and so on			2
most of its protection appears to come from steel , although this is not a great shock absorber - and somehow @entity16 is able to survive even the heaviest of blows from @entity207			2
the reason is thanks to the imaginary mineral called vibranium which , while fictional , has some science at its core			0
@entity16 also has his shield as protection , which can deflect bullets , grenades , lasers and so on			2
the reason is thanks to the imaginary mineral called vibranium - which , while fictional , has some science at its core			0
it appears that this material can turn vibrational energy from an impact into light energy ‘ this material can absorb a near infinite amount of vibration energy without getting too hot or melting , ’ explains dr @entity56			0
as evidenced by a flash of light as @entity207 hits the shield , it appears this material can ‘ convert vibrational energy to light energy , ’ keeping the captain safe			0
of course , you have to suspend disbelief just a bit to assume this is possible - but perhaps the @entity0 have more of a root in science than you thought .			1

@entity27 's @entity26 video explains the @entity0
it looks at the composition of @entity13 's suit and @entity16 's shield
and it also explains science behind @entity169 's super-healing abilities
the *verdict* is that some - but not all - of the science is *plausible*
