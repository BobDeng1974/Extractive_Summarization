@entity3 's december 12 rocket launch shows the reclusive @entity5 country has likely developed the technology to fire a warhead that could reach the @entity9 @entity8 from 6,200 miles away , @entity1 officials said on sunday			1
‘ as a result of analyzing the material of @entity15 ( @entity3 's rocket ) , we judged @entity3 had secured a range of more than 10,000 km in case the warhead is 500 - 600 kg , ’ a @entity11 official said during a news briefing			1
@entity3 has said the rocket launch was carried out to put a satellite in space for the first time			2
critics say it was aimed at creating the kind of technology needed to mount a nuclear warhead on a long - range missile			1
but experts say @entity3 is still years away from mastering the technology needed to miniaturize a nuclear bomb to mount on a missile			1
@entity53 , the @entity9 , @entity1 and @entity54 , among other countries , immediately condemned @entity3 after it fired its long - range rocket			1
@entity53 's foreign secretary and first secretary of state @entity56 mp was one of several international figures to describe the move – which defied a world ban on ballistic missile tests – as ' provocative '			1
@entity3 is banned from testing missile or nuclear technology under @entity45 sanctions imposed after its 2006 and 2009 nuclear weapons tests and the @entity48 condemned the launch			1

' this provocative act will increase tensions in the region			2
i deplore the fact that the @entity3 has chosen to prioritize this launch over improving the livelihood of its people , ' he said			0
even @entity88 , @entity3 's closest ally , expressed regret that a rocket was launched ' in spite of the extensive concerns of the international community			2
' it was a rare show of @entity88 solidarity with the @entity96 , which labelled the rocket test ' a highly provocative act that threatens regional security			1

@entity3 space officials insist the rocket is meant to send a satellite into orbit that can study crops and weather patterns			0
but @entity160 experts note that the technology involved in a satellite launch is similar to that needed to develop a very long - range missile			2
the launch of a rocket similar in design to one capable of carrying an atomic - tipped warhead as far as @entity169 raises the stakes in the international standoff over @entity3 's expanding atomic arsenal			2

however , experts believe the @entity3 lacks the ability to make a warhead small enough to mount on a missile that could threaten the @entity9			1
one part of the rocket landed west of the @entity186 and another part was expected to have landed east of the @entity188 , according to reports			0
@entity9 space expert @entity190 , of the @entity191 , said the three - stage @entity15 rocket delivered the satellite into orbit and constituted ' a perfect success for @entity3			1
' he said that based on his own calculations an object identified by @entity9 space command was from the @entity3 satellite			2
when @entity3 announced its plans to attempt to launch a long - range rocket earlier this month @entity201 said such a move would be a ' highly provocative act '			1
the @entity206 has said the purpose of its @entity15 rocket is to put a satellite in orbit - but @entity201 regards the explanation as a cover for a test of technology for missiles that could be used to strike the @entity9 a similar launch in april , which broke apart shortly after lift - off , was widely condemned , and this latest move is expected to provoke a similar reaction from the international community			1
' it was a surprise in terms of the timing , ' said @entity224 , senior defense analyst with the @entity225 think tank			0
' they had talked about postponing for a week			0

@entity277 also criticized @entity9 policy toward @entity114 , calling it a ' long - term failure			0
' ' the @entity288 administration 's approach continues to be unimaginative and moribund			0

@entity114 is thought to have a handful of rudimentary nuclear bombs , but is not yet believed to be capable of building warheads small enough to mount on a missile that could threaten the @entity9			2
@entity3 has spent decades trying to perfect a multistage , long - range rocket			0
experts say ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies , engines and other technology			0
this is the fifth attempt at a long - range launch since 1998 , when @entity114 sent a rocket hurtling over @entity54			0
previous launches of three - stage rockets ended in failure			0

@entity3 under its new leader has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless @entity201 scraps what @entity114 calls a hostile policy			2
the @entity48 has imposed two rounds of sanctions on @entity3 following its nuclear tests , and a 2009 resolution orders the @entity206 not to conduct any launch using ballistic missile technology			1
the council condemned the failed @entity3 launch in april and ordered seizure of assets of three @entity3 state companies linked to financing , exporting and procuring weapons and missile technology			1
under @entity48 resolutions , nations are also barred from buying or selling weapons with @entity3 , a key source of revenue for its authoritarian government			0
@entity3 said it chose a safe flight path so debris would not endanger neighboring countries			0
but there are still concerns over falling debris , and @entity54 's defense minister issued an order to missile units to prepare to intercept the rocket if it or its fragments threatened to hit the country			0
