@entity0 prepared for his first @entity2 appearance since leaving the @entity4 tour in turmoil 18 months ago with back - to - back failures in @entity7			1
@entity0 , who looks sure to open with @entity8 in the first test against @entity10 in @entity11 on monday , fell for just two , top - edging an attempted pull against a @entity7 side bolstered by @entity15 bowlers @entity16 and @entity17			2
it follows his third - ball duck at the hands of his @entity15 team - mate @entity22 but @entity0 at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in @entity7 ahead of the main business next week			2
@entity0 failed twice with the bat during @entity15 's warm - up for the first test in @entity31 @entity0 is dismissed by his @entity15 team - mate @entity22 in @entity7 @entity0 ’s only rival for the opener slot , @entity35 ’s @entity34 , was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off - stump for 23 but @entity8 and @entity37 looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match			1
@entity15 gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first test as their low - key warm - up week meandered to a close			1
their four days of cricket have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action			0
@entity0 looks set to open the batting with @entity8 in @entity11 in the first test next week @entity15 completed four days of low - key , uncompetitive warm - up action in @entity31 on thursday @entity8 @entity0 @entity54 @entity37 @entity55 @entity56 @entity57 @entity58 @entity59 @entity60 @entity22 the decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow @entity58 and @entity60 to face some admittedly low - quality bowling , suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team			1
barring a raging turner in @entity11 next week there will be only one spinning place and @entity60 , already a likelier pick than @entity35 's @entity73 , was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit			0
his dismissal gave @entity73 a chance of his own but @entity60 was given priority and can now start preparing for a second @entity2 cap			0
@entity58 , meanwhile , was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session , when @entity15 pressed for an extra half - hour 's play following rain delays			0
that suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of @entity17 and @entity16 , who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case			0
captain cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on thursday @entity37 looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired @entity15 will leave @entity7 and head to @entity11 for the first test against the @entity10 on monday those decisions aside the second in a pair of two - day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill , with @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity104 dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side , while @entity54 , @entity0 and @entity55 featured for both teams at various points			1
@entity37 looked in best form , making a fluent 43 before retiring , while captain cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session .			0
