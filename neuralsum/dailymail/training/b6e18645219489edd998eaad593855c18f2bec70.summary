by @entity0 fury : business leaders lambasted @entity3 , pictured , yesterday for dismissing their reports that the @entity5 had savaged takings business leaders lambasted @entity3 yesterday for dismissing their reports that the @entity5 had savaged takings			1
the @entity8 said their claims were ‘ absolute nonsense ’ and many restaurants , attractions and stores were ‘ quids in ’			1
the assessment , which led to him being called an idiot , is at odds with evidence from the @entity19			1
it found takings were down by an average of 40 per cent at central @entity24 restaurants			1
theatres , attractions and @entity28 retailers , who have taken on extra staff and extended opening hours for an anticipated @entity5 rush , also say they are suffering			1
the situation is so serious that the mayor of @entity24 , @entity32 , held an emergency summit with tourism and retail chiefs in a bid to encourage shoppers into the capital			1
and last night @entity39 also urged people to come back into @entity24 , which @entity5 travel warnings have helped turn into something of a ghost town			1
rejecting the complaints of traders , mr @entity3 , who is @entity5 minister , had said : ‘ some @entity28 businesses have done extremely well because they ’ve marketed on the back of the @entity5			1
‘ some businesses have taken a hit , others are doing very well , but overall there is a big increase in business in the @entity54			0
’ asked about a fall in trade , he replied : ‘ this is absolute nonsense and we have just got to knock this on the head			0
anyone who has a business anywhere in @entity24 is frankly quids in			2
’ but @entity64 of the @entity19 said : ‘ he is wrong			0
the evidence shows a very different picture			2
assessment : the @entity8 said their claims were ' absolute nonsense ' and many restaurants , attractions and stores were ' quids in '			1
he is pictured at an event yesterday with prince @entity75 ‘ our postcode research shows an average decline in takings of 40 per cent in central @entity24 restaurants compared with a year ago			1
one is down by 61 per cent			2
‘ the problem is that the authorities were making so much noise about fears of gridlock			0
people were told not to drive into @entity24 and to work from home			2
‘ as a result , restaurants are really struggling			0
demand has been slack for six weeks at the same time costs are rising			0
all of a sudden , we see a 40 per cent fall in takings			1
’ she said the real concern was that there was no guarantee things would bounce back			0
where are they all ? @entity102 in @entity24 was struggling to pull in visitors yesterday , despite @entity3 's claims spokesman for the @entity106 , @entity107 , who runs porters in @entity110 , described the @entity8 as ‘ an idiot ’			2
‘ this is total rubbish			0
there has been a serious fall in trade , ’ he said			0
‘ they encouraged the @entity117 to stay out of @entity24 , which removed the regular trade we rely on			2
’ the @entity19 and other organisations were called in by mr @entity32 ’s office on wednesday			0
warnings not to go into central @entity24 will be dropped			1
@entity123 , which speaks for tour operators bringing foreigners to the @entity117 , said people had stayed away because @entity127 exaggerated the chaos			0
the prime minister said : ‘ the messaging we gave to people about making sure @entity24 traffic jams were n’t too bad was very important but now frankly we ’ve shown the capital is n’t in meltdown			2
‘ people can start coming back into the capital to spend money in shops , restaurants and the rest			0
bare : theatres , attractions and @entity28 retailers , who have taken on extra staff for an anticipated @entity5 rush , also say they are suffering			1
this was the scene in the normally thriving @entity110 earlier this week ‘ people , and news organisations , were predicting there would be a meltdown , traffic would n’t cope , we ’d have an absolute disaster			0
‘ i do n’t think they were overblown			0
we ’re holding an @entity5 in one of the most thriving and busiest cities in the world			2
‘ we had a responsibility to work with the public to make sure traffic did n’t grind to a halt			0
‘ now we can say to people it ’s working well , @entity24 ’s open for business , come back			2
’ bizarre : @entity24 's @entity169 was extremely quiet this week @entity171 shopping centre at @entity172 will turn away shoppers without @entity5 tickets between 9.30am and 4pm today and tomorrow			1
the decision has been presented as an effort to counter overcrowding but it will also drive trade to other parts of @entity24 that have suffered during the @entity5			1
as many as four million people in @entity24 will work from home for at least some days during the @entity5 , it is claimed			1
the figure – based on a study by @entity185 – demonstrates that the dire warnings of commuter gridlock have had a profound effect on work patterns			0
it also explains the many scenes of quiet trains and streets .			0

his assessment is at odds with evidence which found takings were down by an average of 40 per cent at central @entity24 restaurants
theatres , attractions and @entity28 retailers who have extended opening hours for an anticipated @entity5 rush say they are suffering
