by @entity0 published : 06:39 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 06:39 est , 7 september 2012 @entity1 is believed to have reduced its orders for memory chips for its new @entity4 from its main supplier and competitor @entity7			1
the claim , reported by @entity9 , suggests that @entity1 has been cutting back its orders from @entity7 as it seeks to diversify its memory chip supply lines , although the @entity13 firm remains on the list of initial suppliers for the new @entity4			1
@entity1 and @entity7 have gone from friendly co-partners to arch - rivals , following @entity1 's claims , upheld by the courts in the @entity20 , that the @entity22 range of smartphone 's copied the @entity4 's classic lines			1
@entity4 vs @entity22 : @entity7 build a range of components for both @entity1 and its own devices - but @entity1 ' is seeking to stop being so reliant on @entity7 ' @entity13 's @entity7 is a core @entity1 supplier , producing micro processors , flat screens and memory chips - both dynamic random access memory ( @entity33 ) chips and nand memory chips - for the @entity4 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
the @entity39 , citing an unnamed industry source , reported on friday that @entity1 had dropped @entity7 from the list of memory chip suppliers for the first batch of the new @entity4 , the @entity4 , which is widely expected to be unveiled next wednesday			2
the source declined to be named because the negotiations are confidential			0
the report said @entity1 instead picked @entity47 's @entity46 , @entity48 and @entity13 's @entity49 to supply dram and nand chips			0
the source said : ' @entity7 is still on the list of initial memory chip suppliers ( for new iphones )			0
' but @entity1 orders have been trending down and @entity7 is making up for the reduced order from others , notably @entity7 's handset business '			2
@entity7 's handset business , led by robust sales of its flagship @entity22 line of products , has become the most important earnings pillar , bringing in around two - thirds of @entity7 's overall profit , and is driving sales of component - from memory chips to micro processors and displays			0
the chips are on the table : a @entity75 production line for mobile phone components ( stock image ) @entity7 , the world 's top smartphone maker , said on thursday that sales of its @entity81 smartphones topped 20 million since its late - may debut			0
the source denied market speculation that the reduced orders from @entity1 were prompted by a souring relationship between the two companies , which are locked in global patent disputes , and said @entity1 had already been looking to widen its supply chain			0
@entity91 analysts estimate @entity1 's purchases of mobile dram and nand chips from @entity7 have fallen significantly and now only account for around 2.5 percent of @entity7 's 2012 earnings .			1

companies are now *bitter* *enemies* following @entity1 's *successful* *$* *1billion* suit against @entity7 for copying @entity4 's design
