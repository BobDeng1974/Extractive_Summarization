by @entity0 last updated at 7:48 pm on 16th august 2011 forces loyal to @entity2 are believed to have more than 200 scud missiles held in reserve to defend @entity5 as rebel fighters draw closer to the @entity8 capital			1
with rebels threatening to take control of two strategic towns guarding supply lines to the city , @entity2 's forces fired the first scud of the six - month long conflict on sunday			1
it came as there was mounting speculation that @entity2 would once again being offered a ' way out ' to prevent massive bloodshed in any final battle for @entity5 by being guaranteed a safe passage to @entity24			1
captured : rebel fighters manhandle a person they believe to be a @entity2 loyalist sniper in the streets of @entity29 , about 30 miles from @entity5			1
rebels advanced into the @entity29 at the weekend innocent victims : @entity8 civilians carry an injured man into the @entity35 clinic in @entity29			2
hospital staff have reported that at least 20 people , including civilians , were killed in fierce fighting to take control of the town significantly , @entity42 envoy @entity41 , @entity43 's former foreign minister , has arrived in the @entity45 capital @entity46 for the meetings with representatives of both @entity2 and the rebels			1
he said there were no direct negotiations as he met the two sides separately in the neighbouring country but a @entity45 security official said mr @entity41 might also meet with a representative of @entity24 president @entity56			0
but @entity8 's rebel @entity58 ( @entity58 ) last night denied it was involved in any negotiations with @entity2 's government or with the @entity42 special envoy for @entity8			1
' the @entity58 would like to assure that there are no negotiations either direct or indirect with the @entity2 regime or with the special envoy of the @entity42 , ' @entity58 leader @entity62 said at a briefing			1
any talks could signal the endgame of a civil war that has drawn in @entity71 and the @entity73 alliance , emerging as one of the bloodiest confrontations in the wave of unrest sweeping the @entity79 world			2
heavily armed and motivated : rebels made significant advances over the weekend and are attempting to encircle @entity5 , which they hope will lead to a political collapse or civilian uprising a @entity86 official yesterday said it was ' deeply disturbed ' about @entity73 's aerial campaign because it has overstepped the intent of the @entity42 resolution that authorized the strikes			1
attacks on non-military targets such as the main tv station and @entity5 airport call into question @entity73 's ability to implement the resolution that authorised the use of force to protect civilians , the diplomat said on a condition of anonymity			2
the scud missile , which is notoriously inaccurate , was fired from a location 50 miles east of @entity106 , @entity2 's home town , and landed in the desert east of the coastal oil town of @entity109 where rebels are fighting for control			1
intelligence officials said the fact that @entity2 's forces had begun using the @entity115 – fired from the back of flatbed trucks or fixed positions – was a sign of the mounting pressure on the beleaguered @entity8 leader			2
their assessment was echoed by @entity123 , associate fellow at @entity71 's @entity124 , who said : ' it 's an obvious sign that the regime 's back is to the wall			0
' in the protracted months of fighting up to now , @entity2 's forces have been using short - range grad rockets but have not before deployed scud missiles , which have an estimated range of about 185 miles			2
notoriously unreliable : a @entity134 - made scud missile , similar to the one fired at @entity109			0
it is said the @entity2 regime has about 200 of the missiles , but their inaccuracy means they pose little military threat in the rebel headquarters in the eastern city of @entity144 , officials said the @entity115 firing was a sign @entity2 would do anything to protect his power			0
@entity71 and @entity150 planes have continued their ' @entity152 ' strategy to destroy @entity2 's homes and compounds – sending a clear message that there is ' no hiding place			0
' rebels may still lack the manpower for an all - out assault on @entity5 , but are hoping their encirclement of the capital will bring down @entity2 's government or inspire an uprising			1
in the past , however , they have frequently failed to hold gains , and a fightback by @entity2 troops could yet force them back			1
referring to the sudden use of @entity115 , @entity169 , media director for rebel forces , said : ' @entity2 troops are using his last gun			0
he 's crazy … we 're scared he 'll use chemicals			0
that 's why we 're trying to end this war and we hope to end it with the least number of casualties			0
' ' we ca n't prevent the @entity115 but we hope @entity73 can			0
@entity73 has the technology to detect them			0
' crisis talks : @entity42 envoy @entity182 , left , meets with @entity45 foreign minister @entity183 in @entity46 analysts say the rebels ' strategy now is to isolate the capital and hope the government will collapse , but they say it is possible too that @entity2 will opt to stage a last - ditch fight for the capital			1
in a barely audible telephone call to state television in the early hours of monday morning , @entity2 called on his followers to liberate @entity8 from rebels and their @entity73 supporters			1
' get ready for the fight ... the blood of martyrs is fuel for the battlefield , ' he said			0
desperate act : the authroisation to use scud missiles by @entity8 leader @entity2 is seen as a last - ditch tactic he was speaking as rebels made their most dramatic advances in months of fighting , shifting the momentum in a conflict that had been largely static and was testing the patience of @entity73 powers anxious for a swift outcome			1
rebel forces in the @entity216 south of @entity5 surged forward at the weekend to enter @entity29			0
the town is about 30 miles west of @entity5 and , crucially , straddles the main highway linking the capital to @entity45			0
a day later , rebels said they had captured the town of @entity222 , which controls the highway leading south from @entity5 and linking it to @entity223 , a @entity2 stronghold deep in the desert			2
' @entity2 has been isolated			0
he has been cut off from the outside world , ' reported a rebel spokesman from the @entity216 , called @entity228			0
last night rebels on the outskirts of @entity29 said forces loyal to @entity2 were still on the eastern edge of the town , from where they have been attacking with mortars , grad rockets and sniper fire			1
medical workers at one of the town 's hospitals said 20 people , a mixture of rebel fighters and civilians , were killed on monday , and the death toll for tuesday had reached one			2
opposing forces : a rebel fighter in designer clothes brandishes an @entity252 , left , while men loyal to @entity2 gesture at the camera and wear bandanas in @entity256 in @entity5			0
