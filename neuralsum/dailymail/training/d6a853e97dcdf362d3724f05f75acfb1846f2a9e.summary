by @entity1 reporter published : 21:03 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 21:05 est , 10 november 2013 researchers in @entity3 believe that the fear of the dentist may be triggered by the grating sound of dental drills and the scraping of pointy instruments as oppose to the pain of surgery			1
according to data reported at the @entity14 meeting in @entity15 on sunday , measuring the way the brain reacts to certain sounds may help doctors treat patients with anxiety			2
pediatric dentist , @entity22 , worked with psychiatrists to test they way sound triggers parts of the brain -- especially those linked to stress and dental visits			1
people who have anxiety associated with going to the dentist experience certain sounds in a different part of the brain than people who are not afraid a recent @entity36 population survey of oral health indicated that around 10 per cent of the population have extreme anxiety associated with going to the dentist			1
a large percentage of the population put off dental visits entirely unless absolutely necessary such as in the case of an abscess or painful @entity46 fear presents serious health problems for patients who could 've been treated sooner			0
the @entity49 reports that @entity22 found that subjects who were frightened by going to the dentist showed marked differences in the brain 's neural activity in response to sound			1
' do you feel anxious when you hear the dental drill ? ' was one of the questions @entity22 asked 21 women and men aged 13 to 19 in a survey measuring the relationship between sound and anxiety			1
researchers scanned participants in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine ( @entity69 ) like the one shown here , while playing a series of dental sounds ' as a pediatric dentist , i 've seen many patients since 1987 , and from my clinical experience , i found that the sound of drilling can evoke anxiety in dental patients , ' @entity22 told @entity49			1
this is the first study ever conducted that measures how the sounds of dental instruments relate to brain activity			2
' do you get tense during dental treatment ? ' was another question he asked the participants in his study			0
the volunteers answered 20 questions on a scale from one to five with one being ' not at all ' and five being ' very much			0
' based on survey scores , @entity22 separated participants into high fear and low fear groups			0
patients who showed no fear of the dentist processed sound in a part of the brain associated with auditory functions while the fearful group processed sound in a part of the brain associated with learning he then scanned his participants in a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine ( @entity69 ) while playing a series of sounds of wrenching dental drills and thirsty suction cups			1
he also played neutral sounds			0
' all of the participants were isolated in the @entity69 room when they listened to the dental sounds , so we could n't see if they responded visibly or audibly to the dental sounds , but we could recognize their responses from their brain activity , ' said @entity22			1
the low fear group showed little to no signs of anxiety about going to the dentist			0
their brain activity showed that when listening to dental sounds , the part of the brain called the left and right superior gyri ( one of the primary auditory areas of the brain ) was triggered more than when hearing neutral sounds			2
the high fear group showed some interestingly different results			0
when more anxious people listened to sounds it triggered a response in the left caudate nucleus ( the part of the brain that may play a role in learning )			2
' we believe the findings can be applied to assess the effectiveness of interventions such as cognitive behavior therapy for patients who have a strong fear of dental treatment , ' @entity22 said			2
@entity152 found that anxiety actually may cause the pain dental patients fear fear of the dentist is an inherited trait , according to @entity152 , a professor of health at @entity160			1
kids whose parents are afraid of the dentist are more likely to be afraid themselves			2
but a survey by @entity165 indicates that pain during dental surgery is very rare			0
he compiled data from 451 adult patients visiting the dentist and found that 75 per cent of patients reported no pain whatsoever			2
patients who had serious dental surgeries such as tooth extraction and root canal traetments had higher pain scores , but some said they still felt no pain			0
anxiety may actually be more a cause of pain than the procedure			0
' the strongest predictor of pain during dental procedures was dental anxiety			0
anxious patients were four times more likely to experience pain than non-anxious patients after controlling for other factors , ' @entity152 said			1
@entity152 believes that more must be done to prevent tooth decay among children than quell dental anxiety			1
' i do nâ€™t think the answer for the @entity199 lies with giving dentally anxious patients brain scans			0
the first thing we need to do is prevent dental caries in young children to stop them having to have extractions , as the most common reason why children have a general anesthetic is to have decayed teeth extracted , ' he said			0
' we also need to improve the amount and quality of research looking at how to effectively manage children and adults who are dentally anxious and provide guidelines for dentists on how to use research - proven interventions , ' he said ' as for anxiety , @entity152 thinks talk therapy and counseling may help patients lessen their stress and therefore lessen pain .			1

researcher @entity22 found that patients who were afraid of the dentist register dental tool sounds in a different part of the brain to those who were not anxious
@entity160 professor @entity152 believes that anxiety itself may be the trigger for dental pain
kids whose parents are afraid of the dentist are also afraid
