by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 15 march 2014 updated : 06:57 est , 15 march 2014 the @entity2 has found that women over 50 who are overweight or obese have a higher cost to the @entity6 due to increased admissions obesity caused by poor lifestyle choices such as diet are the cause of one in eight hospital admissions for women over 50 - years - old , according to a new study			1
researchers from the @entity16 found that hospital admissions for women over 50 are commonly caused by issues to do with obesity or being overweight , and that these issues accounted for around 2 million days in hospital a year			1
the research was part of the @entity2 , one of the biggest health research projects currently taking place in the @entity26			0
researchers found the information by looking at the diseases in women with a high body mass index ( @entity31 ) of more than 25 , including type 2 diabetes and heart disease			2
however , while these diseases are common with women over 50 who have a high @entity31 , the study found that most of the issues were to do with cancer			1
weight is one of the big risk factors for breast cancer , and is one of the few that can actually be altered			0
this was explained by lead author of the study @entity48 , who said : ' a lot of the work i do is related to cancer			0
' a lot of the risk factors for breast cancer , in particular , you ca n't change			0
' in some sense , it is quiet nice to think this is a modifiable risk factor – there is a lot to be gained by not putting on excess weight			2
' the @entity2 estimates that the annual bill to the taxpayer by overweight or obese women over 50 and their hospital visits is around £ 500 million , based on one @entity6 bed costing £ 250 a day			1
the study looks at changes in health of the whole population over time , and has been running since 1996 , looking at around a quarter of all the women in the @entity26 aged between 50 and 64 - around 1.3 million women			1
36 per cent of the 1.3 million participants were overweight , and around 18 per cent were obese , more than 54 per cent of the total women who participated , and a few per cent less than the official figure of women in @entity77 - 58 per cent			1
the @entity6 may be spending more money on conditions related to obesity , like hip replacements and heart disease , due to the poor lifestyle choices commonly associated with being overweight some of the most common reasons for overweight women being admitted were cataract surgery ( 45,000 admissions ) and gallbladder disease ( 35,000 admissions ) , followed by breast cancer ( 34,307 admissions ) and heart disease ( 32,483 admissions )			1
the study found that weight was a big factor in both minor and major conditions			2
women with a @entity31 higher than 25 were at a big risk for diabetes ( 74 per cent of admissions ) an knee replacements ( 66 per cent of admissions ) , and one in five heart attacks were because of weight			0
minor conditions included carpal tunnel syndrome ( 31 per cent of admissions in overweight people and 23 per cent in obese people ) , which cost the @entity6 a lot because they are common			0
the study found the more weight women put on , the more likely they were to spend time in hospital			2
@entity116 told the @entity117 : ' previous reports may have under - estimated the effect of @entity31			0
' the increased risk is quiet steady			0
' the study did not look at how much the cost of the increased admissions was to the @entity6 , but they do intend to study this as well , with estimates that conditions to do with weight are more costly to the @entity6 than others			0
one peculiar aspect that the study found was that overweight women who had a @entity31 higher than 25 were less likely to smoke or drink , which meant that the majority of admissions with overweight women were due to conditions only related to being overweight rather than other factors .			1

women over 50 who were admitted to hospital were more likely to be obese
study found that conditions related to obesity could be costing @entity6 £ 500m
@entity2 by @entity16 examined 1.3 million women
found @entity31 may be more *important* risk factor than previously thought
