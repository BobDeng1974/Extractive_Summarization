by @entity0 professional chefs spend hours perfecting the presentation of dishes , but one photographer has revealed the unseen beauty of food that hides deep within these restaurant meals			2
@entity10 - based @entity9 thinly slices and flattens food between panes of glass and photographs them by manipulating background light and colour			1
he states his images of potatoes , broccoli , melon , and more resemble supernovas in space , or the vascular system in the human body			1

following the @entity43 disaster , he used neon paints and contrasting hues to represent the radiation seeping into the ground			0
he begins by thinly slicing and flattening food between panes of glass before photographing them			1
the background and colour is manipulated using light shone from behind , and ink within the panes			1
his images include melons , tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , broccoli and more			1
the project is called naturally modified			2
‘ food , as well as being what we live off of , is my art. it ’s what i work with , ’ explained @entity9 in @entity63 within documentary , produced by @entity66 ’s magazine @entity65			1
‘ something so simple can be so complex			0
there are so many layers to it ; we always have this intimate experience with it , but we do n’t know anything about it			0

following the @entity43 disaster , he used neon paints and contrasting hues to represent the radiation seeping into the ground			0
‘ i thought it was quite fascinating that you can take something you have an extremely familiar relationship with , and manipulate it in a minor way but one that completely removes you from any context you were familiar with , ’ he continued			0
he admitted the images that were the most difficult to get flat , or to slice or get the fluid out of were the most rewarding , including watermelon			2
@entity9 said the thing that struck him the most as he worked with the food was the similarities to other objects in the universe , such as space and mri scans			1
‘ you start seeing common threads in the universe , you start understanding through how little you know , you want to learn more			0

for example , he claims tomatoes are just bags of cells , like our bodies , and his images of watermelons , and corn remind him of the vascular system			2
when he exhibits his artwork , he deliberately does n’t include labels ‘ because that generates a conversation ; people have to ask , and talk about the process			0
’ ‘ a lot of the time , some people view art with a label first and that ruined it for me			0
’ an example @entity9 gives in the space within documentary is an image of an orange he exhibited in @entity178 that was purple			1

meanwhile , tomatoes ( pictured right ) are just bags of cells , which @entity9 claims is just like human bodies many of @entity9 's image resembles images from space , such as this shot of @entity197 , a false colour image created using observations from the @entity201 and @entity202 space telescopes			1

@entity9 admitted that these differences and insights ‘ blew his mind ’ a woman told him she could see people dancing in the painting , while another saw fire and that these differences and insights ‘ blew his mind ’ however , he did n’t see the beauty in all foods			2
‘ my relationship with fast food really changed after photographing it , ’ said @entity9 , ‘ because i had to have my hands in it for an extended period of time - but [ it ’s ] just an amorphous blob			1
‘ there was no definition			0
beef came from a cow , so it should have something that tells you what it was before , so after doing that i do n’t eat cheeseburgers any more			0
’ @entity9 concluded : ‘ we usually just take food on the surface , we do n’t usually question anything			1
