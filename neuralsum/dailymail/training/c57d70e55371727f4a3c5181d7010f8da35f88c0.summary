sir @entity1 ’s decision to retire understandably came as a shock to the @entity4 squad - but none took the news harder than @entity7			1
that is the opinion of @entity9 , who revealed it was patently evident that the @entity11 struggled to cope			1
@entity1 had been a contributive factor in @entity13 moving to @entity14 from @entity15 for £ 24million back in 2012			1
@entity7 ( right ) took the news of @entity4 manager sir @entity1 's retirement badly @entity13 alongside @entity18 during the dismal 5 - 3 defeat away at @entity20 on sunday @entity9 - who moved to @entity21 in the summer - was talking to @entity22 the 31 - year - old ’s goals in his first season at the club were a major reason behind the @entity27 clawing the @entity29 title back from @entity30			1
@entity9 told @entity22 : ‘ it took the wind out of everyone 's sails			1
' it gave us an extra push to go and win be successful in that last season			2
‘ everyone was really appreciative for what he 'd done for our careers			2
' the person it hit more than anyone was @entity7			1
he 'd come the year before , tasted that success and wanted more			2
‘ visually you could see it hit him harder than anyone else at the time			0
’ @entity13 struggled for form under @entity51 - whose name was n't referenced in @entity9 's interview - last season			1
there appeared to be lasting damage to the striker after @entity1 's announcement , and the @entity11 said last year : ' i had to gasp for breath and i shook my head			1
had he really said what i thought he 'd said ? ' the room fell deathly quiet and then everyone became emotional			0
' sir @entity1 then had a long talk with the squad			1
i found it a very special speech and felt privileged to have witnessed it			0
' @entity9 ( celebrating with @entity71 and @entity72 ) played for @entity4 for 12 years @entity9 was disappointed to see @entity73 ( right , celebrating with @entity74 ) leave for @entity15 @entity9 , who was n't afforded the opportunity to say an elongated goodbye to the club he 'd played for since 2002 , also expressed regret at @entity79 allowing @entity73 to go to to @entity15 on deadline day			2
' i was surprised [ at the move ] , ' he added			0
he 's a local lad and has come through from the @entity83 eights			0
for him to leave was a little bit disappointing			0
i do n't think we 've seen the best of @entity73			0
he 's still got a lot more in him			0
' i hope the @entity15 manager gives him the chance to be that responsible front man he wants to be			0
i 'm sure you 'll see him flourish			0
