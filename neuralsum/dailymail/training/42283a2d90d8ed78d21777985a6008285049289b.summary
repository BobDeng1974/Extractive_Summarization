by @entity0 watching my five - year - old son @entity2 playing with my nine - month - old daughter @entity3 on her play mat , i sometimes have to pinch myself			1
most mothers think of their offspring as little miracles - but mine really are			2
for had i become pregnant with them while living in @entity9 , i do n't think my children would be here now - in fact , i might have still been childless			1
it 's a bold statement , but one i feel is justified by my experience			2
i became pregnant with @entity2 when my husband @entity14 and i were living in @entity15 - i 'd previously suffered two early miscarriages			1
the first was in 2004 in @entity18 , when i was nine weeks pregnant			2
i 'd hoped it was just ' one of those things '			2
i was only 26 at the time and had conceived easily			0
@entity0 was pregnant in @entity22 where the hormone progesterone is given to help prevent miscarriage but when i had a second one four years afterwards at just six weeks , i began to worry			1
was there something wrong with me ? this time around , i was living in @entity22 as @entity27 , now 34 , was working there as a pianist			0
my doctor in @entity15 suggested there might be underlying problems , but told me to wait a while and try again			1
then i became pregnant for a third time			0
but just days after a positive pregnancy test , when i was five weeks ' pregnant , i started bleeding very heavily			0
like all women who 've had more than one loss , i knew the telltale signs of miscarriage all too well : painful cramping in the stomach , heavy blood loss and an intuitive sense of doom			0
and , as i felt myself lose my third baby , a flicker of fight came over me			0
' go to my doctor , please , ' i begged @entity27			1
' see if there 's anything he can give me			0
' i did n't dare move from my bed - terrified that if i did , the worst would happen			0
@entity0 - who again took the hormone for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy - with second child @entity54 @entity14 rushed off to the hospital where my doctor worked			1
an hour later , he came back clutching a paper bag from the pharmacy			0
i asked him what it was			0
it was the hormone progesterone			1
i 'd read about progesterone and knew it was important to help women conceive			1
many doctors even call it ' the pregnancy hormone ' - so important is it to sustaining a pregnancy			1
i 'd also read a deficiency in it could lead to problems : progesterone causes the lining of the womb to thicken to prepare a supportive environment for a fertilised egg			1
without it , the lining can sometimes not be sufficiently thick for the embryo to implant and be sustained			0
i had no idea if i was deficient in progesterone or not			1
but something told me to give this pregnancy every chance			0
so i had the medication ( it came in pessary form ) and lay on the bed for a few hours			0
i got up terrified of what i 'd find , but the bleeding had stopped			0
next day , despite my spending a sleepless night worrying , the bleeding did n't start again			0
a few days later i saw my doctor , who told me to keep taking the pessaries			1
for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy i carried on taking the progesterone daily and , sure enough , i had no further bleeding			1
i 'd read on the internet that some women said they felt side - effects from the treatment such as tiredness , but i had none			0
at my 12 - week scan , i did n't dare believe all was well , but it was - on screen a tiny , healthy little foetus was bobbing about			0
at about 13 weeks , i weaned myself off the progesterone			1
i was petrified , like a junkie giving up a drug			0
my doctor told me there was no danger if i stopped suddenly - reassuring me that , by 12 weeks , the placenta took over the production of hormones necessary to sustain pregnancy			1
but when he saw how nervous i was , he suggested i take one every other day instead , until i ran out			0
i still worried that if i stopped i 'd bleed and lose the baby			0
i had no more bleeding and , at 38 weeks , i went into labour naturally and gave birth to @entity2			0
i was thrilled to be a mother , but when we moved back to the @entity9 about ten months later , i spoke to other mums who 'd suffered early miscarriage			1
i told them about the progesterone i 'd been given in @entity22 and their eyes widened			1
@entity0 and husband @entity14 , 34 , pictured with their children , lived in @entity22 as he was working there as a pianist ' you have to jump through so many hoops to get it here , ' they all told me			1
i read that in @entity22 , as in many other @entity135 countries such as @entity136 , progesterone is given out far more freely than in the @entity9 - indeed , progesterone is among the most commonly used drugs in pregnancy in @entity136 and in @entity22 , with almost a third of women at risk of miscarriage being prescribed it			1
while there are no official figures on the hormone 's use in the @entity9 , ' from experience it seems there are higher rates of progesterone prescribing in @entity135 ' , says professor @entity154 , a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the @entity156 in @entity157			1
this is despite the fact that in @entity22 , for instance , the official approach is similar to the @entity9 , with progesterone only given to women who 've had ' recurrent ' miscarriage - usually taken as three or more losses			1
while in the @entity9 it appears that women need to try harder to get it , even if they fit this criteria , in @entity22 doctors are more likely to give it to women to try as they do n't think it can hurt - even in some cases before they have suffered three miscarriages			1
i 'd had two losses , but my @entity22 doctor thought it was better to try something - ie , give me progesterone - than do nothing			1
five years after @entity2 was born , i was pregnant again			0
happily , we were back in @entity22 where my husband was again working			0
when i saw my doctor - a new one this time - and told her of my previous losses , she did n't question my belief that progesterone had saved @entity2			1
without even sending me for tests to see if my progesterone levels were low , she scribbled something on a prescription and sent me off to the pharmacy			1
the proportion of women offered pain relief and support after miscarriage again , i took the hormone for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy			2
nine months later i had a healthy baby - @entity3			0
i will never know if progesterone helped me stay pregnant or if those first early pregnancies were doomed to fail anyway			2
maybe i never was progesterone - deficient			2
no one ever tested my levels , so who knows ? but i think that even if the progesterone did not help me , it helped me believe i had a safety net ; which no doubt helped me keep a positive attitude - something all too important after a miscarriage			2
so why is progesterone not so freely given in the @entity9 ? should women who 've suffered recurrent miscarriage have the option ? professor @entity154 believes the hormone can be helpful , and describes himself as ' a fan of giving women progesterone because it 's perfectly safe and is a helpful thing to give to women who 've had miscarriages before '			1
' @entity228 is a smooth muscle relaxant and it 's a very important part of pregnancy			0
some women are deficient and the medical logic is it makes sense to give it to them			0
we do n't fully understand why some women are deficient in progesterone - there seems to be a wide variation in the “ normal ” level of progesterone needed in early pregnancy - but there is a lot of ongoing research to try to identify why some women have higher levels than others			2
' opinion here is divided over the benefits of progesterone			2
@entity253 , national director of the @entity254 , says there is a lack of evidence it helps : ' what 's more , we do n't know if there are any disadvantages to using it			0
' @entity0 's son @entity2 , 5 with @entity3 at about 4 months old professor @entity154 says there is ' conflicting evidence over whether progesterone works or not '			1
' what 's difficult is , if you give progesterone to a woman who has miscarried and she does n't miscarry , you ask is it due to the progesterone or something else ? ' the good news is that a major trial involving more than 800 women in @entity9 and the @entity278 could help settle the question of whether women who 've miscarried should be given progesterone			2
the hope is the study will show clinicians that progesterone does make a difference , and encourage them to give it out as a result			2
in the trial , which started in 2010 , women who 've had three recurrent miscarriages or more are given progesterone or a placebo in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy			1
the results will be published this october			0
would i have gone on to carry a pregnancy successfully without progesterone ? @entity298 figures suggest about 20 per cent of pregnancies miscarry in the first three months and many women who lose these babies do go on to have successful subsequent pregnancies			2
maybe , i might have been one of those fortunate women			0
but it 's hard not to believe that progesterone saved @entity2 and @entity3			2
i just hope other women are given the chance i was .			0

@entity0 suffered *multiple* miscarriages until she took progesterone
her doctor in @entity15 prescribed the hormone and she now has two children
