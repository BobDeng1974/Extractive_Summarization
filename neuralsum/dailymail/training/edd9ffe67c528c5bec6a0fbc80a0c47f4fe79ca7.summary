@entity0 could lend his expertise to @entity4 's @entity3 bid as he makes the first moves in his coaching career			1
the 35 - year - old former fly - half , who retired during the summer after a glittering 17 - year career , has been invited to cast an eye over @entity11 's squad as they prepare for next year 's tournament on home soil			1
@entity0 , who is currently coaching for one week a month at former club @entity15 , insists that just because he could play the game , it does not necessarily mean he can tell others how to do so , but he admits he may take up the invitation			1
@entity0 pictured with the @entity3 in @entity20 on friday speaking at @entity22 at an event to recruit @entity3 volunteers , the @entity4 2015 ambassador said : ' i have spoken to the guys a bit , just because they were saying feel free to come along and have a little chat and see what you think and if there 's anything you can add			1
' i have got plenty of time - and i need plenty of time - to understand where i go next			2
i 'd love to go down there and see what they 're doing because whatever they are doing is very , very good			0
' i may pop down there and spend a little time at @entity43 on the sidelines and watch the guys doing what they are doing and enjoy that			0
' @entity0 's coaching aspirations are currently no more extensive than his role at @entity15 , and thoughts of greater involvement are far from his mind			1
he said : ' at the moment , it 's great to know the guys i am working with , and i can grab them			2
i know them already from playing with them and i can say , ' look , let 's work on this '			2
i know what they need and i know their personalities , so i am already a step ahead			0
' but it 's a tough world and the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that just because you played the game , you know what you are doing			2
' @entity4 's @entity0 kicks a penalty during extra time in the 2003 @entity3 final @entity72 , of course , has far greater responsibilities as he attempts to emulate the feat of sir @entity75 , the coach who led @entity0 and his team - mates to @entity3 glory in 2003			1
he and his coaching staff were this week awarded six - year contracts by the @entity80 , prompting @entity75 to suggest that could diminish the hunger and fear factor within the camp			1
however , @entity0 does not believe that will be the case			1
he said : ' i do n't think these guys would want to be there if it 's not working			2
they are proud professional people and if they are there , the pride and hunger and expectation of themselves is going to be greater than anyone else			0
' that 's what @entity99 does , that 's what @entity102 does , what @entity104 does , and @entity11			2
they do n't accept ' okay ' just because they have now got the right to say , ' maybe i can guarantee that much money now ' , or ' i can buy that car ' or whatever			0
' @entity72 's players will go through the sternest of tests in their autumn programme , which kicks off on november 8 with a daunting clash with reigning champions @entity117 at @entity119			0
@entity0 could lend his expertise to @entity4 's @entity3 bid in some form @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 will also visit headquarters before the month is out , and @entity0 believes the opening two fixtures against the @entity117 and the @entity123 will provide a benchmark of just where @entity4 are in their preparations			1
he said : ' @entity117 , what they do is they just do things very , very well over and over again and they wait for you to break , and all teams break			0
' it 's the team that has suddenly found a way of saying , ' well actually , we are going to do this back to you , and you are the ones that need to worry about breaking '			0
they do n't worry about breaking because they are the ones who are doing the pressure side			0
' @entity123 is the other one			0
i know @entity4 have n't really beaten @entity123 - that would be a nice monkey to get off the back			1
' they have got wingers who attack rucks like madmen , they have got centres who are bigger than back - rowers , and it 's that challenge that you face			1
' as much as @entity117 have that as well , with @entity123 it 's in your face and you have got to front up to that			0
those two would be big victories			0
' @entity0 scores the crucial drop goal as @entity4 win the @entity3 in @entity125 in 2003			1

@entity0 is currently coaching for one week a month at @entity15
