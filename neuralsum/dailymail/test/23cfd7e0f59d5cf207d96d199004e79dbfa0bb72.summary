@entity1 boss @entity0 vowed not to give up on @entity3 qualification after a convincing 2 - 0 win over @entity5			1
the @entity6 moved within four points of the @entity9 top four after goals from @entity11 and @entity12 saw off the struggling @entity13 at @entity14			1
with fading champions @entity20 now looking vulnerable in fourth , @entity1 's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back - to - back losses to @entity18 and @entity19 - could have been reignited			1
@entity11 wheels away in celebration after scoring @entity1 's opener @entity0 said : ' the players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can			1
we have shown we can put results together consistently			1
we have important players coming back which is good news			2
' but we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning			2
' there are teams above us but , as we have seen last year , there can be changes and points dropped and i think there will be changes			1
' @entity11 curls the ball in to the far corner of @entity42 's net to give @entity1 the lead @entity1 , inspired by @entity44 , started superbly with @entity11 scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created			1
@entity5 rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but @entity12 made the game safe in the second half			1
@entity0 said : ' it was a good performance			1
i thought that our attacking play was very bright , we looked exciting going forward , we worked hard in the midfield			2
@entity11 's shot nestles in to the back of the net as @entity42 picks himself up from @entity14 turf ' at times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals			1
' the defeat was @entity5 's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle			1
their misery was compounded when @entity71 was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence , when he caught @entity74 on the ankle			2
manager @entity76 admitted @entity71 could easily have been shown a straight red , however			2
@entity12 secured three points for @entity1 that narrowed the gap on @entity20 he said : ' the sending off , it could have been a straight red , i will be honest			1
i have said that to @entity71 , i am quite straight and i wo n't defend anyone if it is indefensible			2
' asked if @entity71 could be fined , @entity76 said : ' i am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure			2
i said before the game we needed to keep 11 players			0
' while @entity76 did not complain about that decision , he was angry that @entity92 did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by @entity94			0
he said : ' the game hinged on a huge decision			0
i do n't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we do n't get big decisions for whatever reasons , it could be me			0
i have spoken to the referee , but it does n't help me			0
' @entity94 clears the ball with his head as @entity74 and @entity92 also scrap for the ball @entity76 did see reason for some optimism , feeling that his side 's performance was much improved from their derby loss to @entity113 last time out			0
he said : ' i thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative , nervous after our performance against @entity113			0
it was a bad goal to concede			0
' after that we grew into the game			0
it is easy to crumble at @entity14 but we did n't			1
one or two guys rolled their sleeves up			0
' i think we got a response			0
we did n't get a result but i saw enough			0
' there are lot of positives to take from the game			0
a lot of people expected us to get a hiding and i think we held our own for the majority of the game			0
