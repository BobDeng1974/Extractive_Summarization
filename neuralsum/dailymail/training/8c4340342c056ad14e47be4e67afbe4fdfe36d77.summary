' he is receiving excellent care at the @entity58 and we could not ask for him to be in a better place			2
' we would like to thank all our family and friends for their best wishes and ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with @entity27 who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as @entity54			2
' mr @entity0 , who contracted deadly @entity27 in @entity18 , is being treated at a specialist isolation ward at the @entity58 in @entity70 , north @entity20			1
dr @entity23 , who has been treating patients in the county 's capital @entity25 , said his friend mr @entity0 was an ' extraordinary guy ' who knew the risks involved , but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and his colleagues			1
he said : ' he and i spoke about the risk together and i think he absolutely understood that there were risks involved			0
' he also knew , though , that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place , so it was a measured risk			2
' but where he was in @entity89 a number of staff had become sick			0
' he was a hugely professional nurse and a hugely dedicated one , so he understood those ( risks ) but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and colleagues he had there			1
' the @entity96 at the @entity58 , @entity20			2
this is where any ebola virus victims will end up dr @entity23 told @entity101 ’s @entity102 : ' i knew @entity54 before he first came out to @entity18 , we discussed his plans for coming out			2
' when the @entity27 outbreak really hit , he moved up to @entity89 , right to the epicentre of the outbreak to try and help			0
' so he and i , my team and him , were in regular contact sharing experiences and when he came to @entity25 we would share a beer			0
' he added : ' will ’s a pretty extraordinary guy			1
even for those of us working with @entity27 patients in @entity18 , he stood out as being particularly brave and really from the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could , not just help patients but i think he had enormous loyalty towards the other staff at @entity89			1
' yesterday it emerged that mr @entity0 will be kept behind plastic sheeting for weeks , if not months , to stop the spread of ebola			1
the 29 - year - old nurse was put into an air transit isolator , a clear plastic sack , to stop the virus escaping into the @entity132 c - 17 transport plane that flew him home from @entity25			1
@entity0 told of @entity18 ’s poverty and his brushes with the country ’s political elite shortly before he was struck down by the potentially deadly virus			1
in a moving email printed in the local village newsletter , he described in vivid detail his first impressions of the west @entity143 country which he had travelled to for a six - month volunteering stint at a hospice in the capital @entity25			2
the nurse , from @entity148 , @entity149 , was helping to treat locals suffering from @entity151 , a disease which , according to the @entity153 , 57,000 people live with and remains a lasting legacy of the country ’s decade - long bloody civil war			2
a group of volunteers wear special uniforms to bury ebola victims in @entity161 in @entity89 , @entity18 at one village meeting mr @entity0 was confronted with armed guards , singled out by dancing ' devils ' because of his white skin and sampled the hospitality of the well - heeled locals made rich from the country ’s controversial diamond mining industry			1
in an email printed in @entity171 , he said : ' after pushing through a crowd outside the house we were ushered inside by police with @entity176			0
' the host , rich and influential thanks to diamonds , had his house boys serve us cans of ice - cold , @entity184 lager			2
' the deputy leader of the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) was there , apparently the second most powerful politician in the country			0
' he told how he was treated to a show from the ' devils ' - locals in an assortment of costumes , their faces painted or covered with wooden masks			0
he said : ' the devils danced wildly to drums and gourd shakers and drew quite a crowd ...			0
as the only white face in the crowd , the devils singled me out for harassment			0
' in order to escape from under their hay and frock skirts i had to give them small change			0
it was all in good humour			0
” but it was not all colourful entertainment and mr @entity0 also revealed the poverty and poor sanitation which blight so many lives there			1
he said : ' the houses are all mud - sand and palm thatch , the water is from one communal well and , of course , there is no electricity			0
' the account was printed by his mother @entity226 , who said her son had been touched by the tales of ' horror ' of those caught up in the country ’s civil war , which ended in 2002			0
in a testament to her son ’s dedication , she wrote : ' above all , though , he finds the people there friendly , funny and hospitable , and is settling into his work , which is to provide home - based palliative care , generally for cancer and @entity151 sufferers , a facility which would be absent were it not for the hospice			0
' on board was a team of @entity1 specialists who conducted a full clinical examination before confirming he was safe to fly			2
foreign secretary @entity249 gave the final approval for the repatriation before the transporter took off at 1.50pm @entity1 time			2
@entity27 is an extremely infectious virus , spreading from person to person as a result of direct contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat			0
the plastic sheeting that will shroud mr @entity0 's body for weeks will protect health workers and other patients from catching the disease			1
throughout the flight the doctors were covered in head - to - toe protective suits – the same uniform will be worn by everyone mr @entity0 sees over the coming weeks			1
on landing at @entity273 last night the volunteer nurse – still inside his plastic bubble – was loaded into an ambulance and driven to the @entity58 in @entity70 , north @entity20			1
there , he was admitted through a specially - assigned hospital entrance , before being taken to the hospital 's high - level isolation unit – the only ward in the @entity1 equipped to cope with ebola			1
he will occupy a £ 25,000 bed that will be burned after he leaves the hospital			0
the bed will sit inside an isolation tent			0
only seven doctors and a handful of nurses will be allowed to enter the room			0
mr @entity0 's treatment will focus on replacing the fluid he loses through internal bleeding			1
police escorting @entity1 ebola patient @entity0 to the @entity58 in north @entity20 an intravenous drip will pump saline solution into his body to try to stop his organs failing			1
the doctors will also treat the bleeding from his nose , eyes and ears			0
if they can not get hold of the experimental ebola drug @entity303 , the doctors will simply try to manage the disease until mr @entity0 's immune system is strong enough to fight it off			1
a filtration system will suck the air away , removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building			0
the air will also be kept under negative pressure to stop any escaping from the tent			0
human waste will be collected in a secure container similar to a pressure cooker before it is decontaminated and disposed of			0
@entity319 , one of the senior doctors at the unit , said earlier this month : ' the reason behind the unit is to protect healthcare workers from highly contagious infections such as ebola			2
' everything is contained within the tent under negative pressure so the air is constantly added and removed			0
' outside the tent , the air flows through a series of filters and is deposited outside the hospital			0

@entity0 was interviewed just days before he contracted the disease
family today issued first statement since 29 - year - old was flown back to @entity1
' we could not ask for him to be in a better place , ' they said
added they were astounded at the speed at which the authorities acted
