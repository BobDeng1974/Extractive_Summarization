the popstar was caught on camera at the age of 14 , in a video which has just now been released by @entity12 , changing the words of his song @entity14 to sing ' one less lonely n * * * * * ' - and joking about joining white supremacist group the @entity7			1
this latest controversy comes after @entity2 , 20 , apologised ' for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable behaviour ' on monday after another video clip was revealed of him using the n - word five times			1
it apparently came about when @entity2 saw a comedian parodying his song online and he then copied the comedian			2
however , @entity12 reports he knew ' almost immediately it was a stupid thing to do ' and confessed to mentor @entity40 and close pal @entity41			2
@entity40 showed him old racist videos to educate him and @entity2 is said to have seen the error of his ways			1
what 's more , @entity12 reports that the @entity47 clan , which features the likes of ' @entity49 and @entity50 – who @entity2 regularly hangs out with – are supporting the never say never hitmaker			1

' meanwhile , @entity2 has claimed that people have tried to extort him over the two videos which have recently leaked but he ' says he will not be shaken down anymore			1
he says he wants people to see the video and he wants to accept responsibility			2
' unfortunately your browser does not support @entity64			0
indeed , the footage of @entity2 telling a racist joke was made public on sunday after he refused to pay $ 1million to the person who had obtained it			1
the singer was held to ransom over the clip , @entity12 has said , by a man who had copied it from a computer hard drive belonging to the singer			1
sources told the website that the 20 - year - old 's reps were contacted two months ago by a lawyer , who represented a client who had worked on the star 's videos			2
@entity12 states that the lawyer said he 'd sell the video to the media unless @entity2 forked out $ 1million , which was quickly refused			1
the price was allegedly later dropped to $ 800,000 and then $ 500,000			2
but the seller was ' sent packing ' by @entity2 's representatives as they felt the video of him telling a racist joke ' was not that harmful ' because he was only 15 when it was recorded			1
the news emerged on the same day that the hitmaker was spotted boarding a private jet , after a brief stay stay at a swanky villa in @entity29			0
causing a stir : the news emerged as the hitmaker was spotted leaving a swanky villa in @entity29 ' i thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes ' : the 20 - year - old , pictured in the clip , blamed his actions on ignorance , but he insisted he 's learned his lesson on tuesday , @entity108 shared the new clip which shows the @entity111 singer , wearing a dog tag and a dark blue shirt , changing the words to his 2009 song @entity14 in order to use the n - word			1
a source told the newspaper : ‘ unfortunately this is the devastating reality of how @entity2 has behaved and reveals his attitude toward such a deeply emotive subject			2
‘ people need to see this			0
normal kids in society do not make these kind of jokes			0
he is protected by a network of staff , but the camera does n’t lie			0
’ on monday , the @entity1 reported how @entity2 faced a backlash from his fans after the clip of him saying the n - word leaked on @entity12			1
showing him the way : @entity40 took @entity2 aside and showed him some racist videos to help him understand why his behaviour was so terrible in hiding : @entity2 has holed up at this luxury @entity29 villa while he waited for the race row to blow over , it has was revealed company : pals including the @entity145 @entity146 were with @entity2 at the stunning poolside hideaway it is believed that both clips dating back to 2009 are from the same video			1
they will be seen as likely to prove particularly damaging to his career because of the help he has received from @entity155 artists			0
the @entity111 star is signed to @entity157 , the label owned by black singer - songwriter @entity40 , while he has performed with a string of black singers and rappers including @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity49			2

i thought it was okay to repeat hurtful words and jokes , but did n't realise at the time that it was n't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance			0
‘ thanks to friends and family i learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologised for those wrongs			0
now that these mistakes from the past have become public i need to apologise again to all those i have offended			0
‘ i take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and i apologise for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake			0
