@entity0 becomes new @entity2 boss as @entity3 thrash out £ 2million compensation deal with @entity2 @entity6 boss @entity5 is interested in replacing @entity0 as manager of @entity3 and would be willing to work with owner @entity8			1
the @entity10 boss is under increasing pressure at @entity6 after sunday ’s defeat at home to @entity14 left them one place above the relegation zone on goal difference only			1
and @entity5 – who was sacked by @entity19 three years ago - would jump at the chance of a return to his native @entity22 and the club he supported as a boy			2
@entity5 is interested in replacing @entity0 as @entity3 manager @entity5 celebrates with son @entity26 after @entity27 makes sure of @entity6 's @entity28 win at @entity19 @entity29 fan and under pressure at @entity6			1
would work under @entity8 and gets on well with chief scout @entity32			2
4/1 @entity33 – out of work and an attractive proposition for @entity8 in that respect			2
7/2 @entity37 – would jump at the chance and possibility of bringing @entity3 favourite @entity40 with him would be popular with supporters			2
10/1 @entity43 – doing a fine job at @entity46 and is respected within @entity44			0
he would find lure of return to @entity50 hard to resist			0
16/1 @entity51 – has emerged as a popular choice among @entity3 and current @entity54 coach might fancy shot at top job			0
20/1 @entity57 - the 32 - year - old @entity58 has been at the club since 2008 and could be given job on interim basis			0
15/8 crucially , he has a good relationship with @entity3 chief scout @entity32 and it is thought he would accept the transfer model which sees @entity32 identify the majority of targets			0
@entity5 , though , faces competition for the position from two out - of - work managers whose unemployment – and thus no compensation fee – would appeal to @entity8			1
@entity33 has not worked since quitting @entity2 at the start of the season and is keen on a return to the dugout			0
@entity3 would represent the biggest club on his managerial cv and it is thought he is interested in succeeding close friend @entity0			1
he was sacked by @entity79 at the end of last season and was in the running for the @entity2 job before @entity0 ’s shock move to @entity85			1
@entity8 has connections to @entity79 and @entity37 will certainly be applying for the position on @entity88			0
were he to persuade former @entity3 favourite @entity40 to join him as assistant then it could prove a shrewd move in appeasing supporters who are sceptical about @entity8 ’s motives in identifying a replacement			1
one name which is proving popular with the @entity3 is that of former @entity97 boss @entity51			2
the current @entity54 coach missed out on the job at @entity79 when @entity37 was appointed last season and he has long since fancied another @entity101 role			0
@entity0 is set to be appointed as the new @entity2 manager @entity3 owner @entity8 , who is currently in @entity104 , will have the final say @entity106 , however , is set to be placed in temporary charge of first - team affairs			1
the @entity3 - born coach boasts a 100 - per - cent record as caretaker boss having guided the @entity112 to a 3 - 0 win over @entity114 in the wake of sir @entity117 ’s sacking in 2004			1
should he impress during a busy january period then a deal until the end of the season at least could be in the offing			0
@entity43 , meanwhile , is rebuilding his reputation at @entity46 but would be tempted by the offer from a @entity50 club			0
he is respected within @entity44 and is another used to working within the @entity126 model of transfers controlled at a level above the manager			0
@entity5 led his @entity6 side to the 2014 fa cup final where they were beaten by @entity132 former @entity79 manager @entity37 is also in the frame for the @entity44 role			1
