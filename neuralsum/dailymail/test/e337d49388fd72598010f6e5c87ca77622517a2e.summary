it has been 40 years since the historic evacuation of the of @entity2 as the @entity3 descended upon the city , and among the many stories of heroism and bravery is that of a father who piloted a military helicopter to fly his family to safety			1
@entity12 was able to fly a @entity13 , the largest helicopter in the @entity15 army , with his three young children and wife out of the city and into the @entity19 where they were all ultimately saved by the @entity20			1
this after @entity12 somehow managed to pilot the helicopter while getting out of his flight suit and jumping into the ocean just seconds before it crashed - all on his own			1
they were also part of the @entity46 special , @entity47 of @entity48			0
on april 29 , 1975 , @entity12 moved his family to his mother - in - law 's house , telling them he would be back the next day in the @entity13 , and that they would hear him coming when he was close			1
' if you hear a @entity13 coming , get ready , ' @entity12 told his wife			2
when he arrived later that morning , his family and a few friends got on - as gunfire from the communist forces grew louder and louder as they came closer to the city - and flew out towards the water			2
shortly after however , they realized they were running low on fuel , and that is when @entity12 reached out to the @entity20 asking for permission to land			1
' i must land or crash into the sea , ' @entity12 said			1
' bravery : @entity12 then flew back out to sea ( above ) and jumped from the helicopter safe : he managed to avoid the large amounts of shrapnel ( above ) when the plan crashed heading back : a motorboat soon grabbed him from the sea ( above ) as he wore just a shirt and his boxers the @entity20 however was not large enough to withstand the force of such a large helicopter , which would likely sink the ship and cause the death of everyone onboard			1
and so it was decided that @entity12 would at least try and save his family			1
he hoovered over the ship as every passenger jumped onto the deck and were caught by sailors , including his wife and three young children			2
that is when he went back out to sea and managed to do the impossible and somehow pilot alone , get out of his suit and jump into the water seconds before the helicopter crashed and sent shrapnel flying everywhere			1
seconds later , he appeared in the water , wearing nothing but his boxer shorts and a shirt			0
hos one possession , some gold he had in his pocket , had fell out and sunk in the @entity19			2
' we could n't figure out how he did it ; he was a @entity110 , ' said @entity111 , the chief engineering officer			0
a motorboat was sent out to retrieve him , and moments later he was reunited with his family			2
the @entity12 family would be part of the 30,000 @entity15 refugees ultimately rescued by the @entity20			1
' it was a happy ending to a shi * * y war , ' said @entity121 , one of the sailors on the @entity20			2
unbelievable : @entity12 somehow managed to operate the plane and it 's intricate system ( above ) alone after everyone jumped over : ' it was a happy ending to a shi * * y war , ' said @entity121 , one of the sailors on the @entity131 's ( above ) feat that was just the beginning for @entity12 though , who now had to start over in @entity136 and try to support his family			1
he did not know the language and he had no money , but he was able to eventually land a job as a technician at @entity141 in @entity142			0
according to his children he was strict , but also self - sufficient and proud , getting the family off government assistance after just a few months and encouraging hard work above all else			0
' your mother and i came to the @entity136 with nothing but my drawers , ' he would tell his children			0
' look at where we are today			0
but we are not poor			0
' he was reunited with the crew from the @entity20 in 2009 , finally revealing his identity after keeping it secret for years , and awarded an air medal for bravery			1
' he was staring at me and i was staring at him			0
he knew and i just knew , ' said @entity121 of the emotional reunion , this despite the fact that @entity12 was already in the throes of @entity164 's			0
it was then that his children were able to see just what their father had accomplished as footage of the day was shared by some of the men who had filmed the incident			0
then , three years later , following a remarkable life , @entity12 passed away			0
he was 73 - years - old .			0

@entity12 piloted a military helicopter on his own to save his family during the fall of @entity2 on april 29 , 1975
@entity12 flew the helicopter to the @entity19 , but had to evacuate everyone when fuel ran low
he flew towards the @entity20 which was too small to allow the helicopter to land , and so he hoovered over as his family safely jumped out
he then flew back out to sea and jumped from the helicopter seconds before it crashed into the sea
he survived the crash and was reunited with his family onboard
he kept his identity a secret until a 2009 *ceremony* commemorating the event
