’ the murderous attack on the @entity8 shopping mall in @entity96 has brought home the need for ‘ permanent vigilance ’ against terrorism in the @entity14 , prime minister @entity213 said today			2
mr @entity213 said he had no intelligence of plans for an ‘ imminent ’ attack in @entity14 but acknowledged that there was a ‘ worry ’ that @entity14 - based @entity12 trained by the extremist @entity225 in the east @entity228 country might return to the @entity14 with the intention of committing outrages			0

contingency plans have already been put in place in the period following the similar attacks in @entity241 , @entity242 , in 2008 , he said			0
mr @entity213 told @entity244 's @entity243 : ‘ we have been looking at this for a long time because of the appalling attack that happened in @entity241 in @entity242			0
‘ i have personally chaired a whole series of meetings years ago , but again actually this week , to check that we have got everything in place to prepare for those sorts of attacks			0
‘ we do n't have intelligence that something is about to happen , but it pays to be very , very prepared , very , very cautious , and to work out we have everything in place we can to deal with awful events like this			2
’ asked whether he was concerned that @entity14 - based @entity12 might export terror from the @entity228 state to the @entity14 , mr @entity213 said : ‘ there is always a worry of that and there is a hotbed of terrorism in @entity12 that spills over into other countries , and we are concerned about that and follow that			0
‘ what it shows i think is that we have to keep going against @entity273 extremism , whether that is people that are home - grown in our own country or whether it is extremism that is fomenting either on the @entity280 or in @entity281 or in @entity282 and @entity283			0
‘ it goes to this whole argument about why we need well - funded intelligence services , why we need to be engaged in the world , we need to share intelligence with others and why we have to be permanently vigilant			0
‘ i take these responsibilities incredibly seriously , i chair the @entity233 meetings myself and i make sure that everything from ambulance to fire to police , that everything is prepared			0
‘ we do n't have intelligence about anything imminent , but of course when that @entity241 attack happened and you see what happened in @entity96 , any responsible government would look at its own processes and procedures , and say how would we cope with something like that ? ’			1
