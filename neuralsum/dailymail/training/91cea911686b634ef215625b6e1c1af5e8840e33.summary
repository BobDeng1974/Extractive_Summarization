by @entity0 and @entity1 the government ’s controversial @entity3 rail link will be dealt a huge blow tomorrow as @entity6 demand that the top speed for trains on the line should be slashed by 40mph			1
the proposal is just one of a damaging series of criticisms of the £ 50 billion @entity3 project contained in a leaked parliamentary report seen by @entity16			1
the slower speed would add ten minutes to the predicted journey time from @entity19 to @entity20 , making it only 25 minutes quicker than current trains			2
@entity22 ( ish ) : the journey time from @entity19 to @entity20 could be just 25 minutes shorter than it is now under plans to cut the speed of @entity3 trains from 225mph to 185mph - to curb emissions critics already say that the project is a waste of money and the marginal savings on journey times do not justify the enormous cost			1
the @entity37 ’s findings come just weeks before a crucial commons vote on legislation that must be passed to give the @entity3 scheme the go - ahead			1
the @entity6 ’ report says : the @entity6 ’ criticisms came as campaigners from the @entity45 issued an expert report claiming @entity3 ’s figures on electricity consumption and carbon footprints are ‘ highly biased ’			1
the @entity45 says the real carbon impact of phase 1 from @entity52 to @entity20 will be more than double the official estimate and equivalent to the emissions of 1.44 million homes , or 5.4 per cent of households in the @entity57			2
@entity58 : the line will run from @entity19 's @entity52 station to @entity20 on a different route to the one now used the mps recommend that ‘ the legally binding commitment to reduce emissions makes even a small reduction [ in maximum train speed ] desirable			1
@entity3 and the @entity67 should therefore examine the scope for requiring a reduced maximum speed for the trains until electricity generation has been sufficiently decarbonised to make that a marginal issue			1
’ dr @entity75 at think - tank the @entity73 , said the new revelations showed @entity3 does not make sense			2
he said : ‘ already the time savings are quite small			0
the problem is if they reduce the speed further then the argument that this project is going to give time savings is further diminished			0
' the most obvious thing to do to if they ’re worried about carbon emissions is not to build it at all			1
from an environmental point of view it makes more sense to make better use of existing lines			0
’ current journey time 1hr 24mins at 118mph @entity3 original plan 49mins at 225mph @entity3 new proposal 59mins at 185mph last night environmental campaigners heaped criticism on the government for its lack of commitment to protecting wildlife and woodlands likely to be affected by the line as it cuts a swathe through some of @entity108 ’s most picturesque areas			1
the campaign to @entity108 ( @entity110 ) accused @entity111 and @entity3 of putting profits before conservation			0
@entity114 , from @entity110 , said : ‘ in a bid to pursue economic growth at any cost as quickly as possible , @entity3 has failed to make any changes that would protect the environment			2
‘ more measures and more funding will be needed if our cherished landscapes , ancient woodlands and wildlife habitats are to be protected			1
’ and he predicted that with the select committee report ‘ the heat ’ will now be on @entity99 to respond with ‘ credible promises ’			0
during a month - long inquiry , the @entity130 warned mps that at least 48 ancient woodlands plus protected species such as bats and water rats were under threat			0
wildlife : the move threatens species of bat , water rat and several trees , according to the @entity130 last night the charity dismissed claims by the government that such environmental destruction could be offset through the planting of trees and vegetation elsewhere			1
the @entity37 ’s report will be considered by mps when they vote on the @entity153 at its second reading later this month			0
this @entity155 must be passed into law to grant permission to the @entity3 scheme , which will eventually see 225mph trains running between @entity19 to @entity160 and @entity161 via @entity20			2
but the @entity45 questioned how rigorously routes have been surveyed to assess the environmental effects			0
spokesman @entity164 said : ‘ there is absolutely no way proper surveying or research of the route could have possibly been carried out to any credible extent in such a short period			0
‘ the current @entity153 has been described as a developers ’ charter because it is laced with clauses that will allow them to build on @entity176 and currently protected countryside			0
’ an @entity3 spokesperson said : ' the levels of environmental protection set out in the @entity181 are higher than for any other project of such a significant scale			1
this includes a commitment to plant more than two million trees along the route of @entity188			0
' the committee has acknowledged that the aim of ‘ no net biodiversity loss ' is a challenging one			0
there may be opportunities to achieve a net gain as the project develops and these will be considered fully			0
' @entity3 acknowledges the need to complete the outstanding protected species surveys as soon as possible and this work continues			2
we share the committee 's regret than some landowners have refused access for environmental surveys and hope they will now grant this access			1
' we will contribute to the government 's response to the committee once the entire detail of the report has been given due consideration			0

details are in leaked parliamentary report seen by @entity16
it would cut speed from 225mph to 185mph , adding 10 minutes to journey
@entity3 's environmental plans also ' not full enough and could endanger bats '
the maximum speed on the line should be cut from 225mph to 185mph to reduce carbon emissions .
environmental surveys on the impact on ancient woods and wildlife have not been carried out on nearly half the land along the route .
the scheme ’s *calculations* for its ‘ biodiversity offsetting ’ plans are not comprehensive and could endanger rare plants and bat species .
@entity3 must *ringfence* a *separate* *budget* for environmental protection and *monitor* measures for 60 years .
