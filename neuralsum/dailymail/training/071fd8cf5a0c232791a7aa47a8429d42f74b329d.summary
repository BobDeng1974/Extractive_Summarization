children will be allowed to buy liqueur chocolates as part of a @entity4 drive to tackle red tape			1
the imminent move will scrap the law that has long banned those aged under 16 from buying any confectionery containing alcohol			0
but alcohol - misuse campaigners warned yesterday that drinks companies may take advantage of the change to create ‘ alco - choc ’ drinks for youngsters – exposing them to spirits from a young age			1
they argue that the liqueur ban makes business difficult for corner shops , insisting that stores will benefit next @entity37 – when sales for boozy chocolate treats are at their highest – without any negative effect on youngsters			0
critics have often ridiculed the ban , arguing that pounds of chocolates would have to be eaten before anybody could get drunk and three years ago the government stopped requiring vendors of liqueur - filled chocolates to hold a licence to sell alcohol			2
but there are concerns that alcohol firms may use the new law to market products specifically for children , familiarising them with the taste of spirits			1
lord @entity59 ( pictured ) of the all - party parliamentary group on alcohol misuse wants to block the change @entity63 , the chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on alcohol misuse , said he would be opposing the law change because lifting the ban would create an unwholesome new opportunity for alcohol companies			2
he said almost 4,000 school - aged children had been taken to hospital with alcohol poisoning last year , adding : ‘ bit by bit children get used to it and they are hooked before you know it			0
' we have had a higher proportion of children being treated in accident and emergency in the last 12 months			0
’ @entity82 condemned the move as ‘ foolhardy ’ and said that such a step should have been made in a health context , so that its full implications could be examined , rather than in a ‘ red tape - slashing ’ @entity88			1
@entity90 spokesman @entity89 added : ‘ you would n’t want bourbon or vodka in children ’s chocolates , even if it is in too small amounts to cause damage			0
