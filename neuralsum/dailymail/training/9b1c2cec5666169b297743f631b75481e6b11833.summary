' this is a step in the right direction , ' mrs @entity10 told @entity31			1
' but we need to see it taken a step further			0
' care homes should be offering families the option of @entity41			1
i would urge all families to use @entity41			2

it comes following several high profile incidents where secret devices have been used			0
' recording equipment can be used to monitor a place , a person , a group or an activity to gather information , ' the 12 - page document states			2
