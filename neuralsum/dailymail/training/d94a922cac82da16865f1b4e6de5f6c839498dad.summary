@entity1 up and dancing naked on stage in front of hordes of screaming women , it is clear that male stripper troupe @entity6 have no shortage of female attention			1
but with randy women throwing themselves at the boys at every turn , what is it like for the long - suffering girls who actually date these honed , human @entity17 dolls ? according to one such woman , who lives with @entity21 fiancé @entity20 ' , 25 , in @entity22 , it 's an exercise in self - esteem			1
@entity24 and @entity25 hold up @entity25 's fiancée you ca n't be an insecure and jealous person , because the job would drive you nuts , ' she says			1
' it 's funny , a lot of the girlfriends or girls the boys start seeing are girls who they meet at the show			1
but the minute they 're with them they want them to quit the job			2
' a lot of the boys have had girlfriends in the past , but it takes a certain girl to understand and look at the bigger picture			2
i 'd say think about it first before you get with a @entity21			1
' ' you have to be down to earth too , ' she says			2
' the boys are n't interested in anything fake			2
' if you have a chance to speak to one of them , just be yourself and down to earth and they 'll like that better than anything			2
the attractive blonde , 27 , who wishes not to be named for professional reasons , has been with her stripper lover for more than two years and could n't be happier - even if he spends his weekends gyrating in front of screaming fans and often comes home to saucy messages			1
' we met in november 2012 at an exhibition in @entity65 where @entity25 and the boys were showcasing their tour and i was doing promotional work			2
@entity25 's fiancée says the perks of the job involve that he 's always in incredible shape ' i was working with my sister and we did n't have the time to watch the show - they were dancing every hour on the dot			1
but on the last day we were walking down one of the stairs and bumped into them			2
' @entity25 started speaking to me straight away and invited us to watch the very last show			2
' i thought it was good even though as it was during the daytime it was pretty @entity25 looked the best to me			1
' ' he invited me out for dinner and i was n't going to go at first			2
they 're stereotyped as arrogant and full of themselves			1
' @entity25 , however , was more nervous than his future fiancée realised , thinking she was way out of his league			2
' to be honest , when i first saw her i thought she was too good for me			1
i was with [ fellow @entity21 ] @entity24 and when we were doing the promo stuff			1
i said " look how gorgeous she is " , ' he says			2
luckily , the two did end up going on the date , and @entity25 turned out to be ' very different ' to how she 'd expected			0
the @entity104 performance was impressive - but it gets much raunchier for the real show since hooking up with a @entity21 , @entity25 's fiancée has taken her girlfriends to the shows			1
' i 'd be worried if people did n't think my boyfriend was fit , ' she says			0
' i 'm not insecure at all and i 'm not a jealous person , but obviously he gets a lot of female attention and people sometimes try to contact him after the shows on @entity116			1
' the boys are all so used to it they handle it really well			0
there 's a strict line between entertaining and crossing the line , and the ones with girlfriends are pretty good at realising that			1
' @entity25 responds to general fan mail - i do n't think it 's nice for guys to ignore friendly fan mail - but some girls send awful messages that cross the line ; private messages trying to take things further			1
she says it 's clear from @entity116 that he is in a relationship , and it 's inappropriate when girls try to ' offer photos in exchange for photos back '			1
' it 's too flirty and it 's not nice to see - but i 'm not worried , ' she says			1
@entity25 says despite stage personas behind the scenes they 're all different in different ways apart from other women fancying her man , @entity25 being in the @entity151 does provide its perks			1
' it keeps him in shape , ' she says			0
' being part of the @entity151 means he 's always working out , and he does get a good salary			1
' however , the promotional model says she works for herself and says she does n't rely on his money			0
the couple got engaged a year after meeting in november 2013 when @entity25 took his girlfriend to @entity168 for her birthday weekend			0
breakfast : at 7am i have 3 boiled eggs and a small portion of smoked salmon with a green tea			0
mid-morning : after i 've trained at 10am i 'll make a protein shake and eata hand full of mixed nuts			1
lunch : at 1pm i 'll have wholemeal rice with vegetables and tuna			0
dinner : around 5ish i will have sweet potatoes with vegetables and chicken , or steak			0
supper : just before bed at 10ish i will have either a shake or two spoonfuls of peanut butter			0
snacks : if i have been good all day i may chuck in a cheeky chocolate bar somewhere			0
' he proposed to me by the @entity196 and then took me to dinner at the @entity198			0
' we have n't set a date			0
we 're having a big engagement party to celebrate first			0
' @entity25 , meanwhile , reveals there are two kinds of guys in the business - those who pull a lot of girls and the homebodies			1
' i know i get a lot of attention but , for me , i see it as a job and good money			0
it keeps me fit as i 've got to maintain my shape , ' says @entity216			0
' once i finish a show i come home as soon as possible to our little pet dog			0
' ' you can think you 're something special and pull a lot of girls or you can see it as a income and then go home to your loved ones			0
@entity25 , originally from @entity227 , used to work as a builder and joined the @entity151 after he was approached in the gym when he was training			0
he went along to rehearsals , immediately got picked up and started a three - month show with the guys in @entity235			1
he has been with the @entity151 for three years and keeps his physique with a tough schedule of training five times a week and a strict diet six days a week			0
@entity240 says keeping in shape is really important what is it like to be single and part of the @entity151 ? it 's great , we have loads of fun on stage and it 's really convenient for my lifestyle			1
we also get paid well to work , if you can call it that			0
i 'm doing something i enjoy and getting female attention for a couple of hours a week is n't bad either ! being a single @entity21 is also great			1
during the week i do n't have time for girls as i am so busy with my businesses ( @entity262 , a non-profit organisation specialising in @entity265 fitness , and the mr @entity265 competition for the most in - shape students in the @entity269 )			2
they can often involve a lot of travelling and also training			0
at the weekend , it 's great to get some female attention - it keeps me sane			1
are you looking for love ? i 'm not actively looking for a girlfriend at the moment , i just do n't have time as i 'm focusing on my businesses			0
saying that if the right girl came along i would n't say no ! i 'm really into fitness and healthy lifestyle so she would have to be too - sometimes girls do n't understand the diet i have to stick to			2
i like girls who have a similar mindset , are really driven , and know what they want in life			0
i find girls who have lots to say for themselves really attractive too			0
@entity240 runs two businesses , @entity262 , a non-profit organisation specialising in @entity265 fitness , and the mr @entity265 competition for the most in shape students in the @entity269			0
