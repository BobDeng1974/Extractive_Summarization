when @entity2 ’s 12 - year - old son got out of his van as he stopped at a zebra crossing , he thought nothing of it			1
but the seven - second stop , which also allowed pupils to cross the road safely , has landed him with a parking ticket and a potential £ 70 fine			1
council officials say mr @entity2 was ‘ parked ’ during the brief stop outside @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the incident was captured on film by one of the council ’s two spy cars			1
@entity22 image from @entity24 's spy car showing two children using the zebra crossing as @entity2 's son @entity27 alights			1
@entity2 showing his £ 35 parking ticket for stopping at a zebra crossing outside @entity13 , @entity14 alongside his son @entity27 , 12			1
the image provided on the penalty notice shows mr @entity2 ’s white van stopped at the crossing as children cross the road and his son @entity27 , a year 8 pupil at the school , gets out			1
mr @entity2 , from @entity39 , @entity15 , said : ‘ i ’ve been getting quite worked up about it			1
it ’s a ludicrous decision – it ’s not like i have parked up and got out			2
‘ i even spoke to a police officer to see if i was breaking some road traffic law but they said i was n’t			2
‘ you can clearly see the kids walking across , i could n’t have driven on even if i ’d have wanted to			0
‘ my son got out at that point but only because we were already stopped at the zebra crossing			1
’ the zebra crossing outside @entity13 where mr @entity2 received his £ 35 fine			1
@entity2 believes @entity24 was wrong to fine him £ 35 as he had to stop at the zebra crossing to allow two children to pass council chiefs are planning a massive increase in the number of @entity22 spy cars to fine @entity60 's hard - pressed motorists			1
the move is despite a pledge by local government secretary @entity63 to outlaw the controversial cars			2
motorists claim that the cars are a ' cash cow ' and are being used to raise extra revenue			2
there are currently in excess of 100 of the cars ( above ) on @entity60 's roads			1
drivers , like @entity2 , have been forced to hand over at least £ 30 million in fines over the past 12 months			1
however , 44 per cent of the 2,500 motorists who appealed the @entity22 evidence had the fines overturned			0
drivers can take their case to a @entity79 to consider their case			0
local government minister @entity81 came out to support motorists claiming : ' they are just an excuse for councils to raise money from issuing parking fines on an industrial scale			0
' they undermine natural justice , as car owners receive the fine weeks later in the post making it extremely hard to challenge on appeal			0
' mr @entity2 received the fixed penalty notice from the council on friday , march 7			1
it orders him to pay £ 35 within 21 days or face a £ 70 fine			2
@entity98 , the council ’s strategic highways and traffic manager , said : ‘ there is an appeals process if people wish to challenge a penalty charge notice they have been issued with			0
‘ we look at each case on its own merit based on the evidence and representations made			0
’ the council ’s two spy cars have raked in almost half a million pounds in their first two years in operation			1
the @entity114 , each equipped with a rotating cctv camera on the roof , issued 15,256 tickets between july 2011 and march 2013 , generating £ 485,950 for the local authority			2
@entity120 , of @entity122 ’s coaches which provides a school - run service in the area , says the fines are making jobs at nearby @entity128 and @entity129 uneconomical			0
it is believed some schools have even resorted to paying fines on behalf of the firms just to keep the coach service running			0
mr @entity122 said : ‘ there needs to be a little common sense coming into these decisions			2
‘ it is as simple as that , but those in power can not see it			0
it is just a money game			0
’ @entity145 , director of civil liberties and privacy pressure group @entity147 , said many councils ignored rules which say @entity22 cars must be used only where it was dangerous for a traffic warden to work			2
he added : ‘ the huge numbers of tickets given out in error and later dropped highlights the risk to innocent people of these spy cars			1
‘ when people see the multi-million - pound enterprise that @entity22 cars have become they will rightly be asking if this is less about public safety and more about revenue raising			0
‘ equally , the high revenues highlight what a lousy deterrent @entity22 is – even when it is a blindingly obvious spy car			0
‘ councils should be working to solve the underlying problems of congestion around schools and understand why so many children arrive by car			0
’ last september , communities secretary @entity63 said he wanted to ban the controversial vehicles			0
mr @entity63 said he wanted to ‘ rein in over-zealous and unfair rules ’ , and that traffic wardens with cameras could do the job instead .			0

@entity2 's son @entity27 , 12 , got out while stopped at the crossing

@entity14 's two spy cars have earned £ *500,000* over past two years
