but it seems tough guy @entity7 may finally have met his match - with a flock of migrating cranes			1
in recent weeks , mr @entity7 has rarely left his official residence , sparking speculation that illness or injury had laid him low			1
is it a bird ? no , it 's a crane ! @entity7 has not been seen in public much since he was flanked by migrating cranes during a well publicised flight in a motorised hang glider back in september but it emerged today that the president 's september flight in a motorised hang - glider , in which he got snarled up with several cranes , may have aggravated an old injury , according to newspaper @entity28			1
mr @entity7 's spokesman @entity29 denied the claims			1
he told the state news agency @entity31 that the president had an old injury , but that it was not connected to the highly publicised flight			2
instead mr @entity29 said mr @entity7 's absence from the @entity36 was down to courtesy for the @entity39 people : he did n't want his motorcade to disrupt @entity42 's notoriously bad traffic			2
you bird brain : mr @entity7 eyeballs one of the @entity3 cranes from the safety of his glider			2
it has emerged that he may have aggravated an old injury ouch : a few days after the september 5 flight , mr @entity7 looked in pain during the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity39 the presidential motorcade forces the shutdown of large stretches of highway , an inconvenience that many irritated drivers mark by blaring their horns angrily as the president 's car races past			1
mr @entity7 has also put off several expected trips abroad , including to @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
the hang - glider flight with the cranes , which took place in september in @entity55 , was one of @entity7 's trademark adventurous media events			1
@entity75 away ! mr @entity7 's spokesman @entity29 said the president had an old injury , but it was not connected to the flight strain : mr @entity29 added that the president had ' pulled a muscle ' but had not tried to conceal it			1
it was usual for ' athletes ' to sustain such injuries , he added the 60 - year - old @entity39 leader has assiduously cultivated an image of vigor and daring			0
he is also an accomplished skier and a judo aficionado			0
' indeed he pulled a muscle , ' mr @entity29 said			0
' it happened before @entity55			0
he was suffering from some muscle pain then			0
' he added : ' actually , we have never tried to conceal it because any athlete has lots of injuries , which , however , do not mean any restrictions of his activities			0

spokesman says @entity7 is suffering from old injury , which is nothing to do with september flight
