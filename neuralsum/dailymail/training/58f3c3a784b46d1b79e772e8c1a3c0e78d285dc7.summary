mormon leaders have finally admitted that the church 's founder and prophet , @entity4 , took as many as 40 wives , some already married and one only 14 years old			1
@entity4 , who wrote the @entity7 and established the @entity8 , had been portrayed in church materials as a loyal partner to his loving spouse @entity11			1
the church 's acknowledgement is part of an effort to be more open about its history as members increasingly encounter claims about the faith on the internet			0
however , they did not know the full truth about @entity4			2
' @entity4 was presented to me as a practically perfect prophet , and this is true for a lot of people , ' said @entity50 , a blogger and editor in @entity52 , @entity53 , who often writes about @entity24 issues			2
she said the reaction of some @entity24 to the news was similar to the five stages of grief , ' this is not the @entity4 i love '			2
according to the church , @entity4 was unlikely to have had sexual relations with all of his wives , as some were ' sealed ' to him for the next life			1
but the multi-marriages were said to be ' an excruciating ordeal ' , for his wife			1
most of @entity4 's wives were between the ages of 20 and 40 , but he married @entity27 , a daughter of two close friends , ' several months before her 15th birthday			1
' according to ' careful estimates ' , the church said @entity4 had 30 to 40 wives			1
@entity4 also wed women who were already married , some to men who were his friends and followers			1
the @entity8 , as the @entity8 is formally known , has posted 12 essays on its website over the last year on contentious topics			2
public admission : the @entity8 of the @entity83 had stayed silent on the issue of @entity4 's polygamy for years			1
pictured is a statue of @entity4 and his first wife , @entity11 , in front of the church 's @entity41 headquarters @entity93 @entity92 , the church historian and a member of its senior leadership , has reportedly said , ' there is so much out there on the internet that we felt we owed our members a safe place where they could go to get reliable , faith - promoting information that was true about some of these more difficult aspects of our history			1
' we need to be truthful , and we need to understand our history , ' @entity108 said			0
' i believe our history is full of stories of faith and devotion and sacrifice , but these people were n't perfect			0
' the essay on ' plural marriage ' in the early days of the @entity24 movement in @entity118 and @entity119 says polygamy was commanded by @entity121			2
it goes on to say it was then revealed to @entity4 and was reluctantly accepted			2
@entity124 and other @entity126 patriarchs had multiple wives , and @entity4 preached that his church was the ' restoration ' of the early , true @entity131 church			1
an essay published by the church describes how @entity4 said he was visited three times by angels between 1834 and 1842 who commanded him to marry more women , despite him already having a wife , @entity11			1
the third time , the essay says : ' the angel came with a drawn sword , threatening @entity4 with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully			1
' @entity145 : polygamy was outlawed by the @entity24 church in 1890			0
pictured are church leaders around that time , including @entity149 , the leader who ended the practice other writings posted by the church in the past couple of years have addressed sacred undergarments worn by devout members ; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy ; and the misconception that @entity24 are taught they 'll get their own planet in the afterlife			0
the articles about @entity4 's wives during the 1830s and 1840s in @entity165 , @entity118 , and @entity166 , @entity119 , comes about 10 months after the church acknowledged polygamy was widely practiced among its members in the late 19th century			1
' as a collection , these are remarkably revealing articles , continuing the new open and transparent philosophy of historical writing , ' said @entity174 , a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at @entity177			0
the information will be surprising to many @entity83 who either did n't know or were encouraged to dismiss speculation as @entity182 propaganda , @entity174 said			0
splinter groups who call themselves fundamentalist mormons still practice plural marriage , including @entity188 ' sect on the @entity53 - @entity190 border			0
@entity83 began practicing polygamy after @entity4 received a revelation from @entity121			1
he took his first plural wife in 1830 in @entity118 , three years after he married his first wife , @entity11 , an earlier article revealed			1
he and his first plural wife separated , but he renewed the practice a decade later in @entity119 , which is where he married the teenager			2
the essay noted that while inappropriate by today 's standards , marriage among teen girls was legal at the time			0
the article acknowledges that many details about polygamy in early @entity205 are hazy because members were taught to keep their actions confidential			0
but research has indicated that @entity4 's marriage to the young girl might not have involved sex			2
' remarkable , revealing ' : experts have commented that the decision to address such issues is an unusually transparent move by the church 's leaders			0
pictured is @entity219 , the @entity24 faith 's most important church some plural marriages were designed to seal the man to the woman for eternity only , and not life and eternity as @entity24 believe , the article says			0
those types of marriages did n't seem to involve sex			0
@entity232 is known about @entity4 's marriages to the already - married women , the article says			1
they also might have been the type of unions that did n't involve sex			0
plural marriage was an ' excruciating ordeal ' for @entity240 and confounding for some men , too , the article says			1
some people left the faith , and others refused to take multiple wives while remaining @entity83			0
when @entity83 trekked cross-country to @entity53 in 1847 , nearly 200 men and more than 500 women were in plural marriage , it says			0
' difficult as it was , the introduction of plural marriage in @entity166 did indeed ' raise up seed ' unto @entity121 , ' the article says			0
' a substantial number of today 's members descend through faithful @entity83 who practiced plural marriage			0

@entity8 admits for the first time how many wives founder @entity4 had
one was aged just 14 , and several were already married to friends of his
the polygamy was an ' excruciating ordeal ' for his first wife @entity11
@entity4 was reluctant to be polygamist , and was forced by angels
