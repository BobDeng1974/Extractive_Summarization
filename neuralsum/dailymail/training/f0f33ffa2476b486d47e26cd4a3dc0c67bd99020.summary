by @entity1 reporter published : 05:25 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 19:35 est , 11 september 2012 a hospital trust at the centre of one of the worst @entity6 scandals is to be investigated by a hit squad amid fears over its dire financial state			1
as many as 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at @entity12 between 2005 and 2009 due to poor care and medical errors			1
now the independent regulator , @entity15 , has announced it is stepping in because the trust is in financial crisis			1
although standards are said to have substantially improved , there are concerns they may soon deteriorate again because of the trust 's spiralling debts			2
dogged by controversy : financial experts are being called in to try and salvage @entity12 , which runs @entity25 ( pictured ) with the result due next month , @entity15 is now calling in firms offering financial advice , accountancy , administrative and legal services to recommend how the trust should run its services			1
@entity15 said the move is aimed at protecting the health services for patients			0
the specialists will explore a number of options including hiving off services to private healthcare providers and they could even recommend that the trust is put into special administration			1
the experts , who will bid for the roles through a competitive tender , will start work shortly and will deliver a report by spring next year			0
it means @entity12 , which runs both @entity49 and @entity50 , could become the second @entity6 trust to be put into special administration			1
@entity53 was put under the charge of a special administrator in june for being on the brink of bankruptcy			1
the trust , which runs three hospitals in the capital , was the first trust to be put on an ' unsustainable providers regime ' because it was losing £ 1million a week			1
the findings of the inquiry into both the failings at @entity12 between 2005 and 2009 and the role of regulators will be delivered to the government by chair @entity68 in mid-october			1
in 2009 , a highly critical report by the @entity70 revealed a catalogue of failings at the trust and said appalling standards put patients at risk			2
between 400 and 1,200 more people died than would have been expected in a three - year period from 2005 to 2008 , the commission said			0
in february 2010 , an independent inquiry into events at the trust found it had ' routinely neglected patients '			1
the trust is in danger of following the @entity53 , which runs three hospitals including @entity87 in @entity88 ( pictured ) and was put under the charge of a special administrator for being on the brink of bankruptcy dr @entity93 , chair and interim chief executive of @entity15 , said : ' we have been working closely with @entity12 to improve its performance			1
' it has made significant improvements in the clinical care provided for patients , but we need to make sure these services can be secured in the long term			0
' it is therefore time for us , as the sector regulator , to step in and look for a solution that ensures services are provided for local patients on a sustainable basis			2
' we have an open mind about the form that solution might take , but it should be the best one for patients in the long term			0
' @entity116 , chief executive of the trust , said : ' we are hopeful that the outcome of this review by @entity15 will be that decisions are made about which services are to be provided at @entity49 and @entity50			2
' reviews of the trust over the last few years and the changes to the way healthcare has begun to be provided nationally have led to a growing feeling of uncertainty about the future of the two hospitals			2
' we welcome monitor working with our commissioners so that clear decisions are taken which ensure that the healthcare needs of local people are met in a truly sustainable way			2
we will , of course , give monitor every support and will cooperate fully with their review team			0
' @entity143 director of strategy and communications @entity145 said : ' @entity147 supports all efforts to improve quality and sustainability of services for patients in @entity153 and welcome this recognition of the value of resolving issues in the healthcare economy at a regional level			0
' the health service continues to be under enormous financial pressure and many changes will have to be made - not just in @entity153			0
' we need to find different ways of commissioning and delivering the services needed to deal with changing patterns of healthcare			0
' a @entity167 spokeswoman said : ' despite improvements , @entity153 is still facing serious financial challenges			0
' this puts at risk its work on improving services for patients			0
it is important that valued local services are sustainable and able to continue providing high quality treatment and advice for patients			0
' by starting to explore options with the trust and local @entity6 professionals now , @entity15 is ensuring that there would be no delay if they need to take action next year to protect the local services that patients need and use			1

financial overhaul has been demanded by independent regulator monitor
