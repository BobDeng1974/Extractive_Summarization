at his best , @entity0 is like a thoroughbred stallion , but you might have forgotten that reading some of the headlines after his performance against @entity6			1
ok , he was n't at his best			0
his body shape exposes him when he is not at the peak of his powers			0
an average @entity11 , a long return journey from @entity13 after a 4 - 1 defeat for the @entity15 last week - these might be taking their toll			1
he was left out of the 18 for the 2 - 2 draw against @entity18 after his delayed return from @entity20 , but the rest did n't seem to help him			1
he still has n’t rediscovered his sharpness from last season			1
@entity0 found it tough going as @entity25 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity6 on wednesday night @entity0 is beaten to the ball by @entity6 defender @entity27 during the @entity29 encounter toure was left frustrated as @entity6 had the better of the chances at the @entity32 @entity33 ( 7.51 miles ) @entity34 11.44 ( 7.11 ) @entity35 ( 7.09 ) @entity36 11.29 ( 7.02 ) @entity37 ( 7.02 ) @entity38 11.07 ( 6.88 ) @entity39 ( 6.77 ) @entity40 ( 6.62 ) @entity41 ( 6.44 ) his stuttering performance is worthy of scrutiny , but let ’s not jump in two - footed here			1
he ’s still a player you want in your team and it ’s too soon to be dismissing him			0
@entity47 will be aware of his destructive capabilities when @entity49 meet @entity25 on sunday and @entity25 will be more of a threat with @entity0 in the team			1
@entity49 will have a gameplan to stop him			0
players can often suffer a @entity11 hangover			1
this time last season , @entity0 had three goals in five games for @entity25 , whereas this time around , he has yet to score			1
he looked to be breathing heavily in @entity60 and , yes , he seemed to leave his midfield sidekick @entity40 to carry the load against @entity6			1
however , a look at the running stats from @entity65 are quite surprising : he covered more distance than his @entity68 team - mate , although both players were left behind by their @entity6 rivals ( see table above )			1
there is a difference between appearing to float across the pitch and what seems to be a heavy - footed lumber			2
@entity0 's heat map in the @entity6 match @entity0 was in imperious form last season as @entity25 marched to their second @entity81 title in three years manager @entity82 and @entity0 get their hands on the @entity81 trophy last season @entity82 worked hard on his match sharpness last season and we got to see the best of him			1
maybe that is all that he lacks right now			0
players like @entity0 - and @entity90 also suffers from this - can look lethargic and cumbersome when they are not at the peak of their powers			1
he was certainly sluggish at times in the @entity32			0
i ’m not unduly worried , because i ’m convinced he can return to the levels of last season			2
it has also been pointed out that he was exposed because he played in a midfield two in @entity60 , but that ’s where he spent most of last season			2
the beauty of @entity0 is that he can be just as comfortable in a two , or playing more advanced as a second striker			1
what is a problem is if he is playing with a bit of a sulk			0
does he have his contract issue on his mind ? he is 31 , he is contracted to 2017 and , while i remain a huge fan , does he really deserve an extension ? city seem pretty smart with their business and @entity0 looks to me to be a player who plays better when he is hungry , not when he is comfortable			2
@entity114 meets and interviews @entity0 at @entity25 's training ground back in april @entity0 rattles home his goal in @entity25 's 3 - 0 win over @entity119 at @entity120 last season toure on the rampage during @entity25 's match with @entity124 at the @entity125 last season talk of a lack of birthday cake and support after the death of a brother seemed to be a smokescreen to me			1
he knows how to play with @entity40 , who is a good foil for him			0
last season , it was was a partnership that allowed him to get forward and score plenty			2
when i interviewed @entity0 for @entity139 , he said this of his fellow midfielder : ‘ he ’s very clever			2
@entity68 play pretty , fantastic football and @entity40 is clever - he anticipates well , he presses well			0
his movement is so good but he can play with the ball as well			0
' before he came to @entity25 , he was at @entity146 playing in my position , more as an offensive midfielder			2
sometimes we have some difficulties because when he attacks i have to stay more to protect the defence , but we are doing well and he helps me a lot			0
@entity153 , a former @entity25 player , scored a late winner for @entity6 in wednesday night 's match @entity0 and his team - mates could only look on as @entity153 's shot took a deflection off @entity159 and went in video we deserved the win - @entity160 ' the manager demands a lot from us because he wants us to have more of the ball and he wants us to attack			1
he does n’t want to just score and defend			0
’ when he gets his body right and his mind clear , i still think we are looking at a beast of an operator			0
yes , he needs to pull his finger out			0
but we know he has the game to do that			0
he scored 22 goals from midfield last season and was the most influential player as @entity25 won the title			1
so before we write him off , let ’s take a close look at him against @entity49 at the weekend			0
big players are drawn to the big games and while he was n't at his best in @entity65 , a heavyweight @entity81 encounter is @entity0 ’s kind of stage .			2

@entity0 's lack of match sharpness was *evident* in @entity25 's loss to @entity6 in the @entity29
the @entity15 still seems to be suffering from a @entity11 hangover
he was left out of the 2 - 2 draw at @entity18 last weekend
this time last season he had scored three goals in five matches - he 's not off the mark yet this campaign
but @entity0 should be back to the imperious form he showed last year when he *regains* match *fitness*
