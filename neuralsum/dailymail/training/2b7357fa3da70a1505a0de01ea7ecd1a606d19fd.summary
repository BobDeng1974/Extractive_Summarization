by @entity0 @entity1 has called on his @entity3 team - mates to treat their @entity4 near miss as the start of a new journey , not the end of their ambitions			1
the @entity11 played their part in a wonderful @entity14 final on saturday - their first ever appearance at such a showpiece - taking a 2 - 0 lead over firm favourites @entity17 inside just eight minutes			1
they were hauled back in by the @entity18 , who forced extra-time before @entity21 secured a 3 - 2 win - and the club 's first trophy since 2005 - with a clinical finish			1
raise your ambition ! @entity1 does n't want @entity3 to rest on their laurels of an impressive season to even reach a cup final far outstripped the ambitions of @entity3 , who had targeted only @entity33 survival on their first season back in the top flight			1
now @entity37 football beckons next term and @entity1 expects the squad 's expectations to be revised upwards based on recent efforts			2
' we want to be successful and we ca n't rest on our laurels now , ' said the full - back			2
' we want to grow as a club , we do n't just want to stand still			0
' the @entity33 is the best league in the world and we want to make sure we are stabilised in it for years to come			0
we also want to come back here and have more days like this one			0
' i 'm proud to play for this football club because it 's a special one and the fans are fantastic			0
' hopefully we 've done them proud			0
when the time comes i 'm sure i 'll enjoy this too but at the moment it still hurts			0
' dream start : @entity59 gave @entity3 the lead in the opening minutes of the @entity4 final at @entity14 like @entity1 , midfielder @entity62 has spent much of his career outside the @entity64 performed impressively on the grand stage and the @entity66 international , who scored in the semi-final , took huge pride in the underdogs ' display			1
' we 're so proud of each other and i 'm proud of all the lads in that dressing room , " said @entity62			0
' we were so close but when you have top quality opposition like @entity17 there 's no shame in losing			1
' the fans were excellent and the last couple of trips to @entity14 have been great for them			1
' they made a big sound and i 'm sure they had a good day			0
' they know how hard we 've worked and i 'm sure they 're proud of all the boys			0
' getting safe in the @entity33 and reaching the @entity4 final , it 's the best season in their history			1
' childhood dream : captain @entity93 is consoled by @entity94 ( r ) after losing 3 - 2 to @entity17 captain @entity93 , whose close - range finish put the @entity11 two ahead following @entity59 's opener , was battling mixed emotions after the match			1
he took defeat harder than most but still acknowledged he has experienced possibly the biggest moment of his career to date			0
' i might sit down in a couple of days and realise that i have lived a boyhood dream , ' he said			2
' i 've played in a cup final , i never thought i 'd score in a cup final , but for now it 's just a feeling of devastation			2
' people are saying how we gave them a great game , but we might as well have been beaten 5 - 0 and never have been in it			2
' to be 2 - 0 up and lose any game is devastating , but when it 's a cup final for a trophy and a medal ...			1
this is one of the worst feelings i 'll ever have			0
