@entity0 , run by principal @entity1 , is offering £ 500 to high - flying students as an incentive to join their new sixth - form a flagship government free school has been accused of wasting public money by offering high - flying students a £ 500 ' incentive ' to join a their new sixth - form			1
@entity10 will hand out the ‘ academic scholarship ’ to all applicants on course for at least five a grades in their gcses			1
yesterday , critics branded the incentive ‘ bribery ’ and not an ‘ ethical ’ use of public funds			1
it is thought to be the first time a school has sought effectively to pay high - achieving pupils to sign up to attend			2
schools have previously offered money or prizes for good attendance or meeting exam targets			0
nearby @entity0 applied to the @entity30 last month to set up the school , with the opening planned for 2016			1
the school will be run as part of the @entity37 ’s ' free school ' programme - which allows teachers , parents and charities to open new educational institutions independent of local council control			1
the application said @entity10 ‘ needs a new college because its young people are missing out on an outstanding sixth - form experience ’			1
to open , the college needs signatures from 1,000 parents , which @entity1 , principal at @entity0 , in @entity51 , says has already been achieved			2
it is hoping to open in 2016 with 500 sixth - formers , rising to 1,200 after three years			1
the website for the new sixth - form advertises an ' academic scholarship ' in which : ' if you are predicted to achieve more than five a grades in your gcses , we will offer you the opportunity to receive £ 500 and a place in our excellence @entity65 to support your post- 16 education			1
' the proposed sum of £ 500 has been described as an ' incentive ' , but the college were not able to say how much it would cost in total			1
@entity72 , vice principal at @entity0 , told @entity73 all eligible students would be paid the £ 500 , but ' we would n't know how many students would receive this until we opened			1
' a number of free schools have come up against criticism in recent years for opening with very low attendance , with one in south @entity82 taking just 17 pupils in september			0
@entity84 , professor of education and public policy at @entity86 , has expressed concern over the use of public money to encourage enrolments in this manner			2
he said : ' i have never heard of this before and i ca n't see that it would be an ethical use of funding , given that it would cost money from the public purse that could have been spent on something else			0
' the college , in @entity51 , is believed to be the first to offer a cash incentive encouraging teenagers to apply he also raised concerns over the social repercussions it could have on pupils who eventually join			0
he added : ' there is a correlation between attainment at 16 and family background and advantage and therefore this funding incentive does n't seem right to me			0
' the concern i would have is that if the money incentive attracts the highest - attaining students in the area , then the mix of students at the school might end up with a more socially segregated system because of the association with the attainment of post- 16 and social background			2
' the move follows a similar system operated by universities across the @entity129 which offer a series of incentives to encourage high - achieving students to apply - including huge discounts on tuition fees , free text books and subsidised accommodation			2
the @entity30 is due to confirm in the next few months whether the sixth - form college has been given approval to progress to the next stage of the applications process			1
this year , @entity0 received an @entity143 rating of outstanding			0
ms @entity1 , principal of @entity0 has asked us to make clear that the kind of scholarship described is well established within many universities , schools and colleges and likely numbers eligible will be less than ten			0
the scholarship will be means tested and therefore arguably not “ unethical ” as the article suggests			0
the college will not give the scholarship to everyone that gets high grades			0
students will have to meet socio - economic and academic eligibility criteria			0
if and when the application is approved the eligibility criteria will be available on the website			0
the scholarships may be awarded in the form of financial support , resources and equipment , not simply cash , as the word ‘ bribe ’ may suggest .			0

@entity0 will open sixth - form ' @entity10 ' in 2016
school is offering £ 500 to joiners with more than five gcse a grades
move *heavily* criticised by education expert for ' unethical use of public funds '
