@entity1 's woeful start to the season continued when they were thrashed 5 - 1 at @entity3 to pile the pressure on manager @entity5			1
his young side looked worryingly frail at the back and fell apart as @entity3 ran riot in the second half with @entity11 scoring twice			2
@entity12 gave @entity3 a half - time lead and although @entity18 equalised , @entity11 's double and strikes from @entity15 and @entity16 made it a miserable day for relegated @entity1 and @entity5			1
all smiles : @entity11 and @entity12 celebrate @entity3 's first goal against @entity1 @entity3 : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity15 ( @entity28 84 ) , @entity12 ( best 89 ) , @entity11 , @entity29 ( @entity16 83 )			1
subs not used : @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 goals : @entity12 23 , @entity15 59 , @entity11 61 , 87 , @entity16 88 @entity1 : @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 67 ) , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 80 ) , @entity44 , @entity18 , @entity45 ( @entity46 60 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 subs not used : @entity51 , @entity50 , @entity52 , @entity53 goal : @entity18 54 att : 26,577 ref : @entity55 ( @entity56 ) despite losing the opening three games , @entity1 made only one change while @entity3 made two with 34 - year - old midfielder @entity27 coming in for his first appearance since march in place of @entity28			1
given those poor results , it was not surprising that @entity1 started nervously and @entity3 had a chance in the third minute when @entity65 found @entity29 just inside the area but the @entity67 volleyed over			0
@entity18 's measured passing got the @entity69 moving but @entity3 had another opening in the 13th minute when the ball dropped invitingly to @entity22 but he shot straight at @entity36 from 15 yards			2
@entity1 were being stretched by @entity3 's movement and in the 23rd minute , they were behind once again when @entity29 crossed from the right and @entity12 steered a volley from eight yards into the roof of the net			0
the visitors needed a spark of inspiration and @entity48 nearly supplied it in the 37th minute with a shot from just inside his own half which @entity21 had to back - pedal to take under his crossbar			0
but @entity3 had been the better side and they came close to scoring again in the 51st minute when @entity12 crossed from the right touchline and @entity23 headed over from eight yards			0
@entity1 had created little but they were level in the 54th minute when @entity48 chipped the ball in and @entity44 laid it to @entity18 who placed a low shot from 15 yards inside @entity21 's right post			0
@entity1 woe : @entity5 suffers his fourth straight defeat this season leaving him on the brink home and dry : @entity3 celebrate their 5 - 1 victory over @entity1 to leave the visitors in trouble at the bottom it stung @entity3 into a rousing response that brought them two goals in three minutes to leave @entity1 sliding to another defeat			1
@entity26 played in @entity29 on the left in the 59th minute and his ball back across was swept past @entity36 by @entity15			0
@entity1 's defence was exposed again in the 61st minute when @entity11 was allowed to turn just inside the right side of the area and the striker arrowed a low shot across the keeper for his first @entity114 goal of the @entity116 closing minutes were a nightmare for @entity1 as @entity11 tapped in after @entity16 hit a post in the 87th minute before @entity16 strode through another gaping hole in the defence to slide in @entity3 's fifth .			2

@entity5 suffers his fourth straight defeat as @entity1 boss
there were second half goals from @entity15 , @entity11 and @entity16 for @entity3
@entity18 got on the *scoresheet* for the visitors at @entity130
