by @entity0 published : 13:48 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 13:49 est , 26 february 2013 @entity1 , the widely used insect repellent , is becoming less effective at repelling mosquitoes , according to new research			1
a landmark study has found that while mosquitoes are initially repelled by the substance , they ignore it if they are later exposed to it again			1
the study tested the response to @entity1 on @entity14 mosquitoes , which are notorious for biting during the day and are capable of transmitting dengue fever and yellow fever viruses			1
@entity1 , the widely used insect repellent , is becoming less effective at repelling mosquitoes previous research had demonstrated how some mosquitoes were genetically immune to the substance , but the new research has shown that even those that would usually be deterred developed a resistance			1
scientists from the @entity25 say that results underline how more research is needed to find alternatives to the chemical			2
dr @entity30 , who led the research , said : ' the more we understand about how repellents work and how mosquitoes detect them , the better we can work out ways to get around the problem when they do become resistant to repellents			0
' deet - or @entity1 - is one of the most widely used active ingredients in insect repellents			2
it was developed by the @entity45 military , following its use in jungle warfare during @entity48 while mosquitoes were initially repelled by the substance , they ignored it when exposed again it is also considered the most effective repellant against mosquitoes			1
until recently it was not clear how the chemical worked , but recent research suggests that insects simply do not like the smell			0
the new study involved providing the mosquitoes with an arm treated with @entity1			2
as expected , they were initially put off by the substance , but surprisingly , several hours later not all the mosquitoes were deterred by the repellant			1
to better understand why this might be happening , researchers attached electrodes to the insects ' antenna			0
they found that the receptors at the end of the antenna were no longer as sensitive to the chemical , although why is not fully understood			0
dr @entity30 said it was vital to understand both these permanent genetic and temporary olfactory changes that were taking place adding that mosquitoes are very good at evolving ' very , very quickly '			0
he stressed that the findings should not stop people from using @entity1 in high risk areas			2
dr @entity30 now plans to find out how long the effect lasts after the initial exposure to the chemical			0
the team would also like to study the effect in other mosquitoes , including the species that transmit malaria .			0

@entity1 is considered the most effective insect repellant
mosquitoes exposed to it are repelled initially , but ignore it if *re-exposed* to it a few hours later
scientists now say an alternative must be developed
