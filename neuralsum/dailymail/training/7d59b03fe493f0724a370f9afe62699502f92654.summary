by @entity0 since may 1973 the record for the longest distance traveled on an extraterrestrial world has been held by the @entity6 ’s @entity5 moon rover , which covered 24 miles ( 39 kilometres )			1
but that record stands no more as @entity9 ’s opportunity rover is now reported to have covered over 25 miles ( 40 km ) on @entity10 , setting a new off - @entity12 driving record			1
and in more than ten years on the surface the rover is still going strong , despite initially being planned only to travel 0.62 miles ( one kilometre )			1
@entity9 's @entity8 , illustration shown , has now traveled over 25 miles ( 40 kilometres ) on @entity10			1
the distance , which has taken 10 years , is a new record for off - @entity12 driving			1
the previous record was held by the @entity6 's @entity5 moon rover , which covered 24 miles ( 39 kilometres ) on the lunar surface ' opportunity has driven farther than any other wheeled vehicle on another world , ' said @entity24 manager @entity23 , of @entity9 's @entity25 ( @entity25 ) in @entity26 , @entity27			1
on average the red planet is 141.6 million miles ( 227.9 million kilometres ) from the sun. with a diameter of 4,222 miles it ’s around half the size of @entity12			2
it ’s absolutely freezing there , with an average temperature of -65 ° c ( -85 ° f )			0
gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours			0
the atmosphere is desperately thin - one per cent of @entity12 ’s pressure - and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide			2
it boasts the solar system ’s biggest mountain - @entity46 , a dead volcano			0
the planet 's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface			0
@entity10 also has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps			0
if they melted , it would cover the whole planet in water 36 feet ( 11 metres ) deep , according to @entity9			0
' this is so remarkable considering @entity8 was intended to drive about one kilometer [ 0.62 miles ] and was never designed for distance			2
' but what is really important is not how many miles the rover has racked up , but how much exploration and discovery we have accomplished over that distance			0
' a drive of 157 feet ( 48 metres ) on 27 july put @entity8 's total odometry at 25.01 miles ( 40.25 kilometers )			0
this month 's driving brought the rover southward along the western rim of @entity74			0
the rover had driven more than 20 miles ( 32 km ) before arriving at @entity74 in 2011 , where it has examined outcrops on the crater ’s rim containing clay and sulfate - bearing minerals			2
the sites are yielding evidence of ancient environments with less acidic water than those examined at @entity8 ’s landing site			0
if the rover can continue to operate the distance of a marathon - 26.2 miles ( about 42.2 km ) - it will approach the next major investigation site mission scientists have dubbed ' @entity92 '			2
observations from spacecraft orbiting @entity10 suggest several clay minerals are exposed close together at this valley site , surrounded by steep slopes where the relationships among different layers may be evident			0
@entity9 's @entity8 , working on @entity10 since january 2004 , passed 25 miles of total driving on 27 july 2014			1
the gold line on this map shows @entity8 's route from the landing site inside @entity105 ( upper left ) to its location after the 27 july drive this chart provides a comparison of the distances driven by various wheeled vehicles on the surface of @entity10 and @entity12 's moon			1
of the vehicles shown , @entity9 's @entity115 and @entity116 are still active and the totals listed are distances driven as of 28 july 2014 the @entity120 @entity5 rover , model shown , landed on @entity12 's moon on 15 january 1973 , where it drove about 24.2 miles ( 39 kilometers ) in less than five months , according to calculations recently made using images from @entity9 's @entity125 ( @entity125 ) cameras that revealed its tracks ' the @entity5 missions still stand as two signature accomplishments of what i think of as the first golden age of planetary exploration , the 1960s and ' 70s , ' said @entity135 of @entity136 in @entity137 , @entity138 , and principal investigator for @entity9 's twin @entity10 rovers , @entity8 and @entity142			1
' we ’re in a second golden age now , and what we ’ve tried to do on @entity10 with @entity146 has been very much inspired by the accomplishments of the @entity5 team on the moon so many years ago			2
' it has been a real honor to follow in their historical wheel tracks			0
' as @entity8 neared the mileage record earlier this year , the rover team chose the name @entity5 2 for a crater about 20 feet ( 6 metres ) in diameter on the outer slope of @entity74 's rim on @entity10			1
the @entity24 is one element of @entity9 's ongoing and future @entity10 missions preparing for a human mission to the planet in the 2030s .			1

@entity9 's opportunity rover has now traveled over 25 miles ( 40 km ) on @entity10
the distance , which has taken 10 years , is a new record for off - @entity12 driving
previous record was held by the @entity6 's @entity5 moon rover , which covered 24 miles ( 39 kilometres ) on the lunar surface
opportunity landed on @entity10 on 25 january 2004 and is still going strong
it was initially intended to last just a few months and travel 0.62 miles ( 1 km )
