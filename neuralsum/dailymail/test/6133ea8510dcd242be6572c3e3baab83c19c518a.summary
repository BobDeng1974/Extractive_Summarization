a comfy chalet and snow - covered pistes make for a good skiing holiday for most people			2
but some like to add a few extra luxury touches to their trips to perfect them - such as a live - in tailor to make the ski gear , two grand pianos flown in for entertainment and a horse and carriage on stand - by 24 hours a day			1
these are just some of the requests made by guests staying with high - end ski - tour company @entity15			1
and they were all fulfilled , the firm told @entity18			0
luxury ski company @entity19 created a private ice bar for guests at one of its chalets in @entity24 ( stock image ) the live - in tailor was demanded to make all the ski and apres ski outfits to a group of guests ’ personal tastes and cost £ 1,700 to hire			1
it cost £ 3,700 for the grand pianos to be delivered - but the guests were keen on their trip being noteworthy so did n't mind splashing out			1
the horse and carriage was n’t cheap either – that drained the customer ’s account of £ 20,000			1
it was on standby for two weeks at a cost of £ 1400 per day			0
another @entity15 guest asked for six helicopters to be requisitioned so that a long taxi transfer could be avoided			0

@entity15 ’s slightly less luxurious sister company @entity19 has also met some pricey – and very exacting - guest requirements			1

bloomin ' expensive : one @entity19 customer requested a bouquet of lily of the valley flowers that had to be larger than the one @entity74 held on her wedding day			0
it cost over £ 2000 the guest specifically asked that it was to be larger than the one @entity74 held on her wedding day			0
a romantic @entity80 guest , meanwhile , wanted @entity19 to create a @entity82 ’s gesture for his wife , so the company , at a cost of £ 7,000 , distributed a trail of rose petals from his master suite to the pool , which was decorated with floating lilies and roses			2
and their guests like to dress to impress			0
one set of male guests requested larger versions of @entity19 ’s @entity98 - style pinafore uniforms for a party – at a cost of £ 700 each .			1
