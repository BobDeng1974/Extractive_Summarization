and you showed us all that we can be : all - welcoming , tolerant , vibrant , with a future every bit as exciting and thrilling as our past			2
’ the mayor yesterday dismissed claims that he is plotting an early return to the @entity145 to try to seize the @entity50 leadership as ‘ complete cloud cuckoo land ’			1
