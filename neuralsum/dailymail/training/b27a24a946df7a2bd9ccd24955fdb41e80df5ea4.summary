but @entity3 felt they should have had another spot - kick when @entity18 was felled by @entity19			1
' it was a blatant penalty			1
i do n’t know why @entity7 did n’t give it but maybe it came too close to the first penalty			2
it should have been an easy decision , ' @entity3 said			2
' @entity47 [ @entity18 ] gets clipped			2
second one was clear but i ’m not sure if it was because it was just after that			0
@entity47 got the ball and @entity19 has clipped him straight after that , it was strange			0
' the best team lost , we deserved at least a replay			0
it should have been 2 - 0 in the first 6 - 7 mins			2
' running away with it : @entity19 ( above ) and @entity33 ( below ) put @entity10 on their way back in it : before @entity36 made it 2 - 1 from the penalty spot former @entity5 striker @entity63 blasted @entity7 on @entity64 : ‘ our best ref apparently ... how can you miss that ? shocking decision			1
