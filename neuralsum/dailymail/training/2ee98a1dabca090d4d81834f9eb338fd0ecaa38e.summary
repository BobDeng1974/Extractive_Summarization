by @entity0 published : 14:37 est , 28 october 2012 updated : 02:22 est , 29 october 2012 retiring : art critic @entity1 has grown tired of the ' fame obsessed ' modern art world a famous @entity5 culture critic has announced he is quitting the world of art as he claims it has become obsessed with celebrities and money			1
@entity1 attacks the contemporary arts scene saying anyone who has ‘ read a @entity14 comic ’ can make a career for themselves in art. the professor and author condemns the ‘ tourist mentality ’ of the industry , complaining it has led to well - known artists being overestimated			1
the 71 - year - old arts and culture critic said it has become ‘ calcified , self - reverential and a hostage to rich collectors who have no respect for what they are doing ’			1
‘ art editors and critics – people like me – have become a courtier class , ’ he told @entity30			1
‘ all we do is wander around the palace and advise very rich people			2
it 's not worth my time			2
’ ‘ if i go to @entity41 , everyone wants to talk about @entity42			2
i 'm just not interested in him			2
’ mr @entity1 said the emergence of arts consultants has led to collectors buying what they have been told is great art , instead of forming their own opinion			1
' it used to be that if you stood in front of a painting you did n't understand , you 'd have some obligation to guess			0
’ ‘ if you stood in front of a @entity55 you have to look at it and it would start to do interesting things			0
now you would n't look at it			0
’ ' overrated ' : @entity1 said the ' tourism mentality ' in modern art led to too much focus on @entity42 famous names : critics and curators are obsessed with famous names like @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity1 said his harsh words comes after several contemporary art curators called the works of modern ‘ celebrity artists ’ , such as @entity69 , @entity68 and @entity74 , glorified			1
one said their acclaim is a result of ‘ too much fame , too much success and too little critical sifting , ’ the @entity30 reported			0
one anonymous curator called @entity81 ’s work ‘ empty ’ , telling @entity83 arts editor @entity82 the high price tag led to curators defending ms @entity69 's work			0
this comes just over a week after @entity42 's @entity88 - a 67ft bronze statue of a half - flayed pregnant woman - was erected in @entity91 , @entity92 despite hundreds of letters of complaint			0
‘ money and celebrity has cast a shadow over the art world which is prohibiting ideas and debate from coming to the fore , ’ mr @entity82 said			1
hyped : @entity42 's bronze sculpture @entity88 is now in place in @entity91 , @entity92 where she will stand for 20 years mr @entity1 ’s ‘ resignation ’ was the result of the world of art becoming too bureaucratic , he told @entity109			1
‘ what can i tell you ? it 's nasty and it 's stupid			0
i 'm an intellectual and i do n't care if i 'm not invited to the party			0
’ will @entity82 added that the focus on big names had led to difficulties in debating and critiquing art. ‘ at the moment it feels like the @entity121 salon of the 19th century , where bureaucrats and conservatives combined to stifle the field of work			0
