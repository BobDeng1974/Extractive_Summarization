some may say that a cafe with no bacon is like a pub with no beer but a business has been forced to take the popular breakfast item off the menu			2
the smell of bacon cooking can really get your taste buds going but a bridal store in the @entity14 shopping centre in @entity15 , @entity7 has complained about the fatty aroma coming through the air conditioning vents from the nearby @entity19 cafe			1
after cooking bacon since january last year , cafe owner @entity20 received a letter from the centre 's management last month pointing out that his lease did not allow him to cook items that required an extraction fan			1
@entity20 has been banned from using bacon at his cafe and now uses jamon instead mr @entity20 said he had been approached by management earlier in the year about the quantity of bacon being cooked			2
' we used to just fry it on the grill which was quite smelly i guess , so then we started baking it in the oven which heavily reduced the smell and we thought everything was good because we had n't heard anything since that , ' he told @entity42			0
but now the bacon has had to be replaced on the menu with jamon - thinly sliced cured ham			1
mr @entity20 is disappointed about the way the issue had been handled with @entity48 bridal shop			2
' we have had zero communication with the bridal store which has frustrated me a little bit , ' he said			0
' if they had just approached us i would have been very happy to look at the options , or rework our menu , or do whatever is possible because we do n't really want to be at odds with another tenant			0
' mr @entity20 ( far right ) with his staff at @entity19 cafe where the smell of cooking bacon has upset a nearby bridal store however , mr @entity20 understands why his fellow tenant was upset about the situation			1
' i would not be happy if i felt that a smell detracted from business - so i really get where they are coming from but i just felt that the way it was handled by themselves and management was n't an appropriate way to do it			0
' but he added that there also needed to be a ' level playing field '			0
' you can always smell different things from the food court and i think that 's an attractive part of the centre - to have a bit of a sensory experience , so i 'm not sure why we are the only ones who have this issue when there is so much going on in the centre , ' he said			0
the @entity14 shopping centre 's management was uncontactable on sunday but @entity92 reported that a centre spokesperson said the cafe 's lease stated that cooking bacon ' is not and has never been permissible '			1
mr @entity20 said most customers had accepted the menu item exchange with only a few upset that they ca n't have their ' saturday morning bacon and eggs			2
' @entity42 contacted the @entity103 bridal shop but did not hear back before publication			0
it stipulates in mr @entity20 's lease agreement that he was not to cook food which needed an extraction or exhaust fan			1

@entity19 cafe has been banned from using bacon
owner 's lease states food that needs and extraction fan ca n't be cooked

@entity15 business has replaced it with jamon - thin cured ham
