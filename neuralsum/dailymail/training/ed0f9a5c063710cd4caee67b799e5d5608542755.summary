by @entity0 @entity1 was sacked from his post at @entity3 last month following an investigation at the crematorium a crematorium boss has been sacked amid an investigation into the historic practice of secretly burying babies ' ashes across @entity11			1
@entity1 left his post at @entity3 last month after it was revealed the facility , and several others , were being looked into amid accusations of malpractice			1
the probe comes after it emerged staff at @entity19 in @entity20 mixed the ashes of stillborn babies with those of adults before unceremoniously burying them in the garden without their families ' consent or knowledge			1
a national investigation into @entity11 crematoria was launched by @entity33 in light of the accusations			2
@entity1 was suspended last month following an investigation into practice at the crematorium in @entity39 , @entity40 , last year			1
the independent audit by @entity42 found the remains of children aged five or under had been scattered in the crematorium 's @entity45			2
but in as many as 40 cases between 1984 and 1985 , this had been done without parents ' consent or knowledge			0
it is not clear whether the families knew the ashes existed at all			1
no ashes had been offered to relatives of dead babies from the crematorium over a five year period , it was also revealed			1
the council maintained burners used at the facility were so strong that the remains of any child below 18 months would not survive cremation , a claim which has been rubbished by scientific investigation			2
in june the council 's chief executive @entity69 announced an investigation would be launched following claims that the ashes of babies and adults had been mixed together			1
the ashes of as many as 40 babies were scattered in the crematorium 's garden of remembrance an independent audit found dozens of cases in which families were not consulted about the scattering of their child 's ashes and may not even have known if they existed today , a council spokesman refused to comment on @entity1 's suspension , but confirmed they were looking to refill his post			1
' we do not comment on individual staffing matters			0
we can confirm that we are advertising for a crematorium manager			0
' @entity94 will of course co-operate fully with @entity33 and her investigation team			0
it is not @entity98 's intention to duplicate the national investigation			0
' lawyers representing families in the area affected by the baby ashes scandal say the removal of mr @entity1 is a sign of acceptance that ' serious mismanagement ' had taken place			1
at @entity19 in @entity20 , distraught families reeled as they were told there was nothing to take home of their beloved baby			0
for 45 years , staff at the facility told parents and relatives the infants ' fragile bones had not survived the strength of its furnace			2
they went home unsatisfied , and longing for a memento of the babies ' brief lives			0
then in 2012 , after a change in management , the crematorium 's lies were revealed			0
@entity131 admitted staff at the facility had been disposing of the remains of stillborn babies or infants who died days after their birth in this way since 1967			1
they claimed revealing to the child 's parents that ashes had in fact been produced would be ' too distressing			2
' instead the ashes were boxed up in cardboard and buried in the garden			1
forty - seven years after the cruel practice at @entity19 began , an investigation was launched into the facility			0
spearheaded by @entity33 , a former lord advocate , the report interviewed bereaved families and staff at the crematorium as well as others across @entity11			1
the 600 page report identifies and examines the cases of more than 200 babies whose cremations may have been mishandled			0
concluding her report , @entity33 wrote : ' there is overwhelming evidence that foetal bones do survive cremation , at least from 17 weeks gestation			0
' the apparent belief at @entity19 that the bones of foetuses and even stillborn and neonatal babies could not survive the cremation process continued , despite the exposure of the superintendent and other staff to evidence and information to the contrary			2
there was , additionally , a longstanding and wholesale failure to comply with the local authority ’s duty to keep accurate records of the cremation of stillborn and neonatal babies			0
the evidence in this investigation discloses a comprehensive and long - term failure to provide an acceptable service to some of society ’s most vulnerable next of kin			0
