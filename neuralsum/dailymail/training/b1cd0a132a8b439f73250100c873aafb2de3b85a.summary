by @entity0 praise : which ? has sided with pensions experts and campaigners for the elderly to back @entity7 's reforms @entity9 ’s consumer watchdog which ? has joined up with @entity11 and pension experts to praise @entity7 ’s people power reforms , saying they will ‘ transform the way people of all ages save for their future ’			1
in a rare intervention into the political arena , the consumer champion claimed the measures will introduce ‘ genuine flexibility and choice for millions of people planning for their retirement ’			1
some @entity27 politicians have suggested that pensioners could not be trusted to spend their money wisely			1
however which ? has come together with over- @entity11 as well as @entity31 – one of the @entity9 ’s largest insurers – and the country ’s most prominent pensions expert dr @entity34 to praise the ‘ landmark reforms ’			1
in a letter to the @entity39 , the experts say mr @entity7 ’s decision that retirees should no longer have to buy an annuity have their ‘ wholehearted support ’ because they mean treating people ‘ like grown - ups ’			1
and they pointedly back the chancellor ’s call for people to spend their pension pot as they wish			1
the endorsement is significant as it is rare for which ? to take sides in a political battle			1
the letter has been signed by which ? chief executive @entity56 , @entity58 the boss of @entity31 , @entity60 of @entity11 and dr @entity34			0
in an attack on the @entity27 politicians who claimed people would waste their money , the experts wrote : ‘ some say people ca n’t be trusted to make decisions about how to invest their pensions savings			1
‘ it is good that people who have saved all their lives will now be able to choose for themselves how to access their pension and whether or not to buy an annuity			2
’ the letter contradicts claims by the @entity77 that the changes will make annuities – for those who do choose to buy them – worth even less in future			0
support : dr @entity84 , the country 's foremost pensions expert , also signed the letter ‘ ending the captive market for annuities will be good for competition , and spur the pensions industry to provide more products and better value , ’ the experts insisted , adding : ‘ it ’s good to see the government encouraging saving and treating people like grown - ups			1
’ dr @entity34 also praised the @entity39 for campaigning to help savers , saying : ‘ i do believe the @entity39 made an enormous difference			2
’ last night @entity7 thanked the group for their unusual intervention , saying : ‘ this impressive letter confirms that the pensions reforms in my @entity105 have struck a chord			1
i ’m grateful for the very positive response from the consumer groups and savings industry			0
’ and @entity110 taunted @entity27 for its uncertain response to the reforms , branding @entity114 ’s team ‘ all over the place ’			1
the prime minister said : ‘ while @entity27 dither and flail around for ideas , we have made long - term changes that will give millions greater security in old age			2
‘ this is about backing those who work hard , save and do the right thing			0
and it ’s about saying that the best people to look after their money are those who earned it in the first place			2
’ @entity132 demanded that @entity114 beef up his economic policies last night after his ‘ lame ’ response to the @entity105 gave the @entity135 a poll bounce			0
and in further dispiriting news for the @entity27 chief , a survey revealed that voters think he is the ‘ weirdest ’ party leader in @entity9			2
the @entity142 poll for @entity143 showed that 41 per cent think mr @entity114 is either ‘ very weird ’ or ‘ somewhat weird ’ , while 34 per cent thinks the same of @entity144 and only 27 per cent believe that @entity110 is weird			0
lame response : @entity114 has faced criticism for his response to the budget the survey , which looked at the public ’s perception of the leaders ’ personalities , also found 36 per cent of the population believe mr @entity114 would have been bullied at school , a third think he would have been an unpopular student and 57 per cent said he would have been the hardest - working pupil			0
but the more pressing concern for @entity132 is that another @entity142 opinion poll put the @entity135 on 36 points , just one point behind @entity27 , while a @entity163 poll had the conservatives on 34 points – also only one point behind			2
and mr @entity114 and shadow chancellor @entity167 were still trailing far behind the @entity164 when voters were asked which party they trust to run the economy			0
a senior @entity27 frontbencher said : ‘ our economic offering was already seen as weak by some voters			0
@entity114 ’s lame response has not helped with that			0
‘ some people seem to think that we can just coast to victory			0
this poll should be a wake - up call			0
