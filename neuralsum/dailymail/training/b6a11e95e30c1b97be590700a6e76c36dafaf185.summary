bones that could belong to @entity1 have been exhumed from a churchyard over fears that they might be stolen or vandalised it couldbe the year for discovering notorious monarchs			1
just weeks after remains found under a car park were confirmed as @entity9 , archaeologists now believe they may just have stumbled on @entity1			1
amid great secrecy , a team exhumed an unmarked grave at a more fitting location for a @entity15 burial - a churchyard in @entity17 named in ancient documents as his burial place			1
after a delicate 10 - hour operation on monday , human skeletal remains were unearthed in the churchyard of @entity24 ’s in the @entity26 area of the city , and taken for storage at an undisclosed location			1
unearthing @entity1 , the @entity31 king who fought off the @entity32 and established the foundations of our law codes and justice system , would be one of the most significant finds ever			2
historians agree that the king , who died in the year 899 after a distinguished 28 - year reign , had a great impact on @entity41 today , safeguarding the @entity43 language and @entity45 religion			2
but archaelogists admit discovering him would be a very long shot , as unlike @entity9 who remained under the same car park for five hundred years , @entity1 ’s bones were moved at least twice			2
earlier this year , @entity50 , an archaeologist from the @entity51 leading the search admitted it would be difficult to prove any remains are his - but hoped her team could prove the age of the bones			2
she said : ‘ if the bones are from around the 10th century then that is proof they are @entity1 and his family , because @entity26 was not built until the 12th century , and there is no reason for any other bones from the 10th century to be there			2
’ no - one from the university would comment on the latest developments last night , as the exhumation was carried out behind metal screens on monday and yesterday in total secrecy for security reasons - although filmed by a tv company			1
it is not known how @entity1 died , but he was buried in the @entity76 , the @entity31 cathedral in @entity17			1
archaeologists carried out the exhumation of an unmarked grave at @entity24 's @entity80 in @entity17 , @entity81 ( pictured ) , this morning on church orders @entity1 lived from 849 ad to 899 and was born in @entity83 , @entity84			1
he is the only @entity43 monarch to be afforded the title @entity86 @entity1 is the only @entity43 monarch to be known as ' the @entity1 ' and was the first to consider himself @entity1 of the @entity31			2
although he is often portrayed as a great warrior in statues around @entity17 and @entity83 , he was not physically strong and is believed to have suffered poro health for most of his life			1
one of the legends surrounding the king was that , while fleeing from @entity95 aggressors , he hid in the home of a woman who did not recognise him			2
she asked him to look over her cakes that were baking in the oven but , troubled by his kingdom 's problems , he absent - mindedly allowed them to burn			1
@entity1 was born in 849 and died on october 26 , 899			2
he had been @entity1 from 871 until his death			0
it is not known how he died			0
he was originally buried temporarily in the @entity76 in @entity17 , then moved to the @entity106			1
in 1110 @entity1 's body was transferred to @entity26			1
soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539 , during the reign of @entity110 , the church was demolished , but the graves were left intact			1
the royal graves and many others were rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed on the site			0
no confirmed remains of @entity1 have subsequently been found			0
when @entity1 ’s son @entity120 the @entity121 built an impressive @entity106 two years later - possibly to house his father ’s body - the remains were moved there			0
then , in the year 1110 , old chronicles reveal the monks at @entity106 moved to new location nearby and took the bones with them again , to @entity26 , a little north of the city , along with the remains of @entity1 ’s wife and children			1
this abbey was demolished when @entity110 dissolved the monasteries in 1539 although most of the graves were left intact			0
the site was looted by convicts in the 1700s and there seem to have been some attempts to dig for @entity1 there in the nineteeth century with no success			0
permission to dig at the churchyard was granted by the @entity145 for security reasons following recent publicity about @entity1 - to prevent people attempting to dig him up			0
a spokesperson for the @entity150 confirmed human remains were exhumed , and that the rector of @entity24 ’s and the @entity153 performed prayers at the graveside beforehand			1
no application has yet been made to carry out scientific testing on them , but the diocese expect this will be received very soon			0
dr @entity163 , a lecturer in early medieval history at @entity165 who is not involved in the dig , told the @entity167 last night : ‘ even if they do radio - carbon dating on the bones which reveals they are from the tenth century , we do not know if it is @entity1			0
‘ the monks may not have moved the correct bones or made sure they were n’t contamined with any other remains			0
‘ with @entity9 , not only did he have distinguishing features , his scoliosis , to identify him , but they were able to find a surviving descendant after 500 years to do dna testing			0
with a king who died more than a thousand years ago that would be very , very difficult			0
‘ the dna testing on @entity9 was done by experts wearing forensic suits , as even breathing on the remains can contaminate it , so i would be concerned about the amount of tampering with the bones over the centuries			0
as a historian i would love it if they found him but it would be an extremely long shot , i would be very dubious if they said they had found @entity1			0
