@entity1 's first season with @entity2 is in danger of turning into a complete mess following the @entity6 defeat by @entity7			1
the @entity8 has enjoyed a stellar career but there are signs that he has yet to grasp the demands of the @entity13 and his decisions have left @entity2 facing a huge fight to salvage some respectability			0
here @entity17 looks at some of the mistakes that @entity20 has made			2
@entity2 manager @entity1 ( left ) and assistant @entity21 during their defeat by @entity7 why sell @entity24 ? there was an inevitability the @entity28 striker would return to haunt @entity20			1
@entity2 's manager may have been happy to sanction that deal to @entity7 last summer but , in many ways , it was a mistake and shows the shifting values of @entity2			2
why did they allow a young @entity36 player whose best days are ahead of him to leave and replace him with someone on an extreme salary who was recovering from injury ? united as a club develop players			0
@entity20 prides himself on working with young talent , so keeping @entity24 should have made sense			1
the ' @entity46 ' policy they are pushing does n't suit them			0
it caused shock against @entity7 that @entity50 was overlooked when @entity2 were losing but has the @entity52 really done anything to justify being at @entity53 ? @entity20 's mistake was letting @entity24 leave and bringing in a player who was n't guaranteed to suit @entity36 football			1
@entity24 shoots to score the winning goal against @entity2 on monday night at @entity53 a stranded @entity59 looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former @entity2 player @entity24 @entity24 celebrated his goal against his former club as @entity7 won the @entity6 tie 2 - 1 @entity63 up in @entity64 so much has happened during this season you could almost forget about the events of tuesday , august 26			1
however , @entity20 made an error that night by selecting a weak team to take on @entity70 in the @entity71			1
with no @entity73 commitments , @entity20 should have gone full strength to give @entity2 a chance of competing for silverware			2
instead , he selected six players who are no longer at the club and that 4 - 0 capitulation increased scrutiny at an early stage			0
no coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but that is what @entity2 did against @entity87 opponents			0
tumbling out of the @entity6 means this will be the first time since 1989 that @entity2 have gone two years without a trophy			1
@entity2 lost 4 - 0 against @entity70 earlier in the season as @entity20 played a weak team @entity70 striker @entity93 celebrates scoring their third goal against @entity2 at @entity96 no coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but @entity20 did against @entity70 not playing to @entity101 's strengths as @entity102 observed after the @entity7 defeat , @entity101 is ' as good as anyone ' when he is deployed in a central striking role			1
to prove that , he has scored three goals in his last three games and is the one @entity2 outfield player who you would genuinely call world - class			2
but @entity20 has muddied the picture by playing him deep at times and not utilising his talents			2
that has had a detrimental effect on results			0
@entity101 , remember , had a spell not long ago when he went nine matches without scoring			0
@entity21 speaks with @entity2 captain @entity101 , who has been played out of position previously @entity20 has muddied the picture by playing @entity101 deep at times and not utilising his talents what has happened to that style ? @entity102 made another pertinent observation when he said it is ' time to stop looking back at what @entity2 had before '			1
they will not progress as a club if they keep harking back to the good old days of sir @entity131			0
what @entity2 have lost , though , is the identity of how they play			2
at their best , you associate @entity2 teams as being fast , dynamic and fearless , always prepared to take risks and stay on the front foot			0
has @entity20 presided over a performance this season that has been universally lauded for attractive football ? no. it says everything about them that against @entity7 they finished off hoisting long - balls to @entity147 and @entity148			1
@entity2 have lacked a good style since @entity20 took charge during the summer after the @entity151 firing it up to @entity147 @entity147 is a good player and he has made a contribution for @entity20 this season but his continued presence in the team is now proving a hindrance			1
@entity157 had the issue when @entity159 played for them in that it became too easy to smash a ball up to the big presence at the top of the field and @entity2 are falling in to that trap			0
@entity20 is a coach whose teams historically play attractive football but @entity147 is making @entity2 a more primitive outfit			1
@entity147 ( right ) more often than not is told to try to win long balls with his presence up front how do you solve a problem like ( @entity175 ) @entity174 ? picture @entity174 in your mind and what do you see ? it will probably be of a flying winger hurtling down a flank , the ball stuck to his foot like glue and a defender spinning and swerving to try and cut out the danger			0
go back to last season 's @entity188 final and you will see countless examples			0
how many times have you see @entity194 do that in a red shirt ? @entity20 talks of philosophies and systems but does n't it just make sense to play players in their best positions ? @entity194 looked majestic early on in his @entity2 career			2
lately he looks to be confused by what @entity20 wants			0
@entity174 is shown a red card during @entity2 's defeat at @entity53 against @entity7 on monday @entity194 leaves the field after being sent off during the defeat that was @entity20 's last chance of a trophy changing the formation football should , essentially , be a simple game but @entity20 's tactics can be confusing and nothing shows that up more than whether he is playing three defenders or four			1
@entity2 pass the ball around at the back without really having a purpose and they now have a habit of getting themselves into a panic , as shown by the mistakes that led to @entity24 's goal			1
it says everything that @entity2 's fans sang ' 4 - 4 - 2 ! ' when they played @entity227 at @entity228			2
@entity20 's ego meant he was always going to be single - minded in his approach to this job but maybe he has underestimated how true @entity2 fans are to traditions			1
ripping up a blueprint that had been successful for a quarter of a century has not had the desired effect			0
@entity2 are now too cautious and have lost their speed and threat			0
it also means they are losing their formidable reputation , too .			0

@entity2 lost 2 - 1 against @entity7 in the @entity6 on monday
@entity1 saw former @entity2 player @entity24 score the winner
@entity20 has made several big mistakes in his first season in @entity28
