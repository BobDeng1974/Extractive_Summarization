by @entity1 reporter it is hardly the most appetising of prospects , but it could just be the only viable way to satisfy the ever - increasing global demand for meat			1
a plan to feed animals with protein - rich maggots which have been reared on cow and pig excrement is currently being trialled by the @entity13			1
soya beans which are normally used in feed for animals such as chickens , pigs and fish , are in great demand so scientists and farmers have been searching for a cheap and viable alternatives			1
too much to stomach ? a diagram explaining how maggots are being used in an @entity13 trial to feed animals which then make it into the human food chain meat demand : an @entity13 trial is underway to see if protein - rich maggots or larvae produced from flies bred on an industrial scale could be used in animal feed the @entity13 plan would see flies bred on an industrial scale using readily - available animal and vegetable waste , with the maggots , or larvae , which they create then being used for feed			1
the type of waste product used would vary depending on the location of the ' fly farms ' with sawdust and even used grain from the whisky distilling process being touted as possibilities			0
with the rising population and changes in dietary habits , the demand for meat and dairy products is predicted to double by 2050 , when there will be an estimated three billion extra mouths to feed			1
@entity63 , a partner at @entity64 in @entity65 , a company involved in the project , told the @entity68 : ' what 's used will depend on the area			0
' in @entity74 , if there are 10 whisky distilleries nearby it will use the grain fermented in the distillation process			0
tucking in : soya beans which are normally used in feed for animals such as chickens , pigs and fish , are in great demand so scientists are looking for cheap and viable substitutes ' in @entity87 it might be pulp from a tomato field , while in a lot of places it will be a mixture of droppings , straw and sawdust you get on chicken farms			2
' the @entity97 fishing - bait farm in @entity98 , @entity99 has been tasked with finding the best way to produce maggots on an industrial scale using waste materials			0
they will then be shipped to @entity105 , in @entity106 where the animal feed trials are being conducted			0
the project , which hopes to determine if the technique is feasible on a wide scale , is due to run for three years			0
however if it is deemed viable , it would require a change of @entity13 law which currently prohibits the sale of meat from animals reared on feed containing maggots .			2

@entity13 plan to use protein - rich fly maggots instead of soya beans in animal feed
waste products *including* spent grain from whisky - making could be used
global demand for meat and dairy products is predicted to double by 2050
