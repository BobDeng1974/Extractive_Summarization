@entity2 powerhouse @entity0 has n't lost a game for his club since april and heads into the new year threatening to be the @entity6 's most dominant player of 2015			1
while @entity9 's men lost their chance of emulating @entity12 's unbeaten season when they were beaten at @entity13 , they still have an @entity14 in their midst in @entity0			1
the 26 - year - old @entity17 midfielder – strong , powerful , tactically and technically excellent and hailed as a ' giant ' by @entity9 – proudly boasts a personal record of 23 wins and seven draws in his last 30 games for the club in all competitions			1
@entity0 's goals : 3 * in all competitions since a 2 - 1 home defeat against @entity31 and as @entity2 chase an unprecedented quadruple , something even @entity9 has n't managed before , @entity0 is the player he can least afford to lose , including @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
lest we forget , @entity2 are currently top of the @entity6 , in the last 16 of the @entity47 , semi-finals of the @entity43 , and the @entity44 is about to start			2
we are all ready to play in every moment , ' insists @entity0 , and if they pull it off , he would be a shoo - in for @entity52			2
it is no coincidence he was out with suspension when @entity2 crashed 2 - 1 at @entity13 at the start of december to lose their own unbeaten run			2
it is the only time since mid-september @entity2 have conceded more than one goal in the game			2
as they prepare for their first test of 2015 at @entity63 on @entity64 , he is the player who separates @entity2 from the rest			2
their rivals boast such glittering names as @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 but where @entity12 , @entity72 and @entity73 miss out is the lack of a truly world - class holding midfield player			0
@entity78 have the closest thing to @entity0 in @entity81 midfielder @entity80 , which is why it 's no coincidence they are next best to @entity2 in the table			1
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates after scoring during a @entity47 group stage match against @entity86 @entity9 has hailed his central defensive midfielder as a ' giant ' - he is a 6ft 4in wall of steel @entity9 says of his 6ft 4in wall of steel : ' he 's a giant			0
not for his size , but for the way he plays			0
' the eye - catching £ 26million paid to @entity98 to bring @entity0 back to @entity99 in january now looks a bargain			0
players are normally physically or technically excellent			1
@entity0 is both , combining outstanding power and a calmness on the ball that allows him and @entity105 to be the launchpad for so many @entity2 attacks			1
intriguingly , it has taken more than five years for @entity0 to become an overnight success in @entity110			0
he originally signed for @entity2 as a 20 - year - old in the summer of 2009 , his official start date coming exactly a month after the appointment of @entity114 as manager			0
had @entity116 been quicker off the mark , they would have got him first			0
he spent a week on trial at the @entity119 after @entity116 had been tipped off by the manager of his @entity122 club @entity121 , @entity123 , but the @entity124 never followed it up			0
@entity2 sold @entity0 ( left ) in 2011 to @entity98 , but bought him back in january and he has become a big success he came up against his current club in the @entity47 in 2012 , while playing for @entity98 in @entity127 instead , the £ 1.1m paid by @entity2 to @entity121 looked money well spent when @entity0 's first three appearances for @entity2 ended in wins by 4 - 0 , 5 - 0 and 8 - 0			1
but after a season on loan to @entity135 club @entity134 to gain first - team experience , the midfielder was surprisingly sold to @entity98 in the summer of 2011			0
even though the £ 21m transfer fee represented a tidy profit for @entity2 , the absence of a matic - type player in midfield was felt as @entity142 tried to build a new attacking @entity2 around the likes of @entity40 and @entity144			0
the experiment with @entity146 did n't work and @entity147 and @entity149 's stints were always going to be brief given @entity142 's uncertainty towards @entity151 and the hostility of the @entity154 crowd to @entity149			0
when @entity9 arrived back in 2013 , he realised halfway through his first season that @entity2 were too flimsy			1
out went @entity157 to @entity72 for £ 38m in the january transfer window in 2014 and back in came @entity0 , at an increased price @entity2 have a number of crucial players , but @entity0 ( far left ) is vital to the way @entity9 's side play it was a surprise when @entity2 sold @entity0 to @entity98 in 2011 , but less of a shock when they bought him back @entity2 had been able to keep a direct watch on the left - footer while he had been in @entity127			1
@entity0 played for @entity98 against the @entity168 in the 2012 @entity47 quarter - finals , which the @entity110 club won 3 - 1 on aggregate , and the @entity173 final the following year , which @entity2 won 2 - 1			1
back at @entity99 , @entity0 impressed towards the tail - end of last season but it 's been this campaign where he has excelled			1
after an uncharacteristically loose start to the season for a @entity9 team , including a 6 - 3 victory against @entity182 , @entity2 have become masters of the clean sheet again			1
going forward , he is also a threat , mainly through his passing but also when he decides to unpack his fierce shot or show his aerial ability at set - pieces			0
not one to shirk a tackle , @entity0 flies into a challenge with @entity193 's @entity192 on december 28 @entity0 runs with the ball between @entity193 pair @entity195 ( left ) and @entity196 ( right ) two of his three goals have come in the @entity47 – in which @entity2 qualified with ease – including a header on his return to @entity127 when @entity2 won 1 - 0 in @entity86			1
perhaps his stand - out display came in a hard - fought 2 - 1 win at @entity73 in november			0
he was voted man of the match at @entity206 as @entity2 resisted a strong performance from @entity209 ' side			2
@entity0 did n't misplace a pass and even gave the team talk before the game			2
' it was very inspiring , ' said skipper @entity39			0
' he is a real player for the team			0
he has been the heart of our performances week - in , week - out			0
' with @entity9 currently in a paranoid state about a ' campaign ' against @entity2 , he will probably remember having @entity220 sent off at @entity222 season by referee @entity223			2
still , with @entity0 in the side , you would n't put money on @entity2 losing their opening game of 2015 or many beyond that .			1

@entity2 have not lost with @entity0 on the field since april
since then , he has played 30 , winning 23 and drawing just seven
@entity0 is strong , powerful , tactically and technically excellent for @entity2
the @entity168 can still win four *trophies* this season , and @entity0 will be at the heart of the team as they strive to make *history*
