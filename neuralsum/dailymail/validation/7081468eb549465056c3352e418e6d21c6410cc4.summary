the government insists that according to the independent @entity37 , by 2019 - 20 , day - to - day spending would only be at its lowest level since 2002 - 03 in real terms			0
mr @entity0 was expected to say : ' the @entity40 will carry on putting in place their vision of how our country succeeds by stripping public services to the very bone so they hit their target of spending back to levels not seen since the 1930s , before there was a @entity51 and children left school at 14			2
