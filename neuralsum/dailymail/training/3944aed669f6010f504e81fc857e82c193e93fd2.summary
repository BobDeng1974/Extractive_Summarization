@entity1 fans or fairtrade food activists ? as it turns out , fans of the boy wizard are concerned about where their magical snacks come from			0
fans are celebrating after winning a four - year battle to get @entity9 to use only fairtrade certified chocolate in all @entity1 - branded chocolate			1
this includes the chocolate frogs that are sold at @entity15 's theme park in @entity16 , as well as the @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity22 founder @entity29 and his slew of activists , which includes @entity1 creator , @entity32 herself , were working to ensure that all chocolate production not rely on child labour and that all producers are paid a decent wage			1
in a 400,000 - strong petition to @entity9 , which own all rights to the @entity1 franchise , which includes products and merchandise , the @entity22 argued that @entity1 's fans did n't think that the fictional wizard would approve of unethically produced chocolate			2
' if ' @entity1 ' [ as a franchise ] were to be in alignment with the values of @entity1 [ himself ] , it could be a real symbolic and coherent victory , ' @entity29 told the @entity50			0
any chocolate products affiliated with the @entity1 will be made only of certified free - trade cocoa chocolate plays an important role in the franchise and is very symbolic to the storyline after @entity1 leaves his aunt and uncle 's house to attend @entity59 , the abundance of chocolate available there becomes a symbol for how the school will nourish @entity1 's body and mind			1
since chocolate plays such an important role in the series , the opportunity to turn fans into real - life advocates was an idea that especially appealed to @entity29			0
the group charged @entity75 , the company that @entity9 used to make all of the @entity1 chocolate , with a poor record of human rights and child labour			2
thousands of fans sent complaint letters over the years and in 2013 , the @entity22 took yet another step forward when they teamed up with @entity83 , an anti-slavery movement , to pressure @entity9 even further			0
in december , it was announced that chocolate sold at the @entity15 theme park would be fair - trade in 2014 , @entity32 also joined the cause			1
on december 22 , @entity90 , the president of @entity91 , wrote an email to the @entity22 announcing @entity9 , ' decision			0
' by the end of 2015 , and sooner when possible , all @entity1 chocolate products sold at @entity9 outlets and through our licensed partners will be 100 per cent @entity99 or @entity100 certified			0
