@entity11 had told the @entity16 that his car broke down a decade ago and , making $ 10.55 an hour , he has been unable to save for a new one			1
' if only my parents could see me now			0
' @entity11 thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with @entity35 and @entity36 , who both helped coordinate the gift , worth an estimated $ 37,000			1
the newspaper said @entity11 takes buses to work , but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route instead @entity11 was greeted by reporters and a team of supporters who first learned of his marathon commute this week in a story that ran in the sunday @entity16			1
the story has since been widely shared on social media , and @entity11 has been featured on national network news programs			2
the publicity has prompted a renewed discussion about reforming @entity1 's troubled public transportation system			0
the publicity surrounding the story has prompted a renewed discussion about reforming @entity1 's troubled public transportation system ' i do n't like it , i love it , ' said @entity11 , 56 , who appeared baffled as he sat behind the wheel of his 2015 red @entity32			1
' if only my parents could see me now			0
' an emotional @entity11 is overcome by the gift of the car that he said was simple on the outside and strong on the inside , a description he also applied to himself @entity35 , 19 , a student at @entity69 , launched an online @entity70 after he read about @entity11 's daily trek between his home in @entity1 and the @entity74 factory in the suburb of @entity76			1
he spent part of the week negotiating a reasonable insurance rate for @entity11 , who has not driven in 10 years			1
@entity35 told @entity79 he was initially quoted a $ 15,000 - a - year premium , a quote that illustrates @entity1 's notoriously high insurance rates			1
the @entity16 was tipped off by @entity36 , a banker who had befriended @entity11 two years ago when he spotted the factory worker walking by his office on his way to work			1
a finance expert has now assembled a group of advisers to manage the ever - growing fund , which is now 17,500 times larger than his annual wage - or equivalent to eight and a half years ' work the newspaper said @entity11 takes buses to work , but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route			2
he starts his commute at 8 a.m. for his 2 - 10 p.m. shift , and does not get home until 4 a.m. @entity11 claims he powers his marathon - like commutes by drinking two liters of @entity104 and countless cans of @entity106 each day			2
' i sleep a lot on the weekend , yes i do , ' he said , ' but i ca n't imagine not working , ' although the commute getting into work is grueling , things are worse on the way back as @entity11 has to walk the streets alone , in the dark and freezing cold			2
none of his co-workers lives anywhere near him , so catching a ride almost never happens			0
he has perfect attendance at his job , the @entity16 said			2
his colleagues have been telling him for years to get a car but it appears that @entity11 has fallen into a routine that he almost seems to enjoy it			2
' i keep a rhythm in my head , ' he says			0
' i 'm not saying i 'm a member of some church			0
but just before i get home , every night , i say , ' lord , keep me safe			0
' about three - quarters of the way home , he has to catch the very last bus of the night at 1am into downtown @entity1 - after that it 's another five mile trek back to the home he shares with his girlfriend			2
@entity11 thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with @entity36 and @entity35 , who both helped coordinate the gift , worth an estimated $ 37,000 the walk takes him through some shady neighborhoods including @entity139 and the infamous 8 mile area			1
@entity11 says he was mugged once but does n't like to talk about the incident			0
four hours later he is back home to catch some shut - eye before the long - distance commute begins all over again the following afternoon			0
' the last five years been really tough because the buses cut back , ' @entity11 said			0
once he gets to @entity146 and @entity1 , @entity11 can take a bus but the schedule is so infrequent the area is really best designed for those that have access to a car			2
he says that it 's not just the $ 1,700 monthly paycheck that lures him back to work each day but the very essence of being around his friendly co-workers whom he calls ' family '			0
the boss 's wife has also taken a shine to him and prepares him home - cooked meals each evening too			0
however , the punishing , all - weather hikes now look like a thing of the past for @entity11 , the car is perfect for the machine operator , who said in an interview with the @entity16 that @entity172 manufacturers are more his style , has said all he wants is a @entity32 , which will set him back some $ 27,000			1

as @entity194 notes , @entity11 lives in @entity76 , a community that has removed itself from the @entity197 bus program depriving him of any fixed - route large buses			2
