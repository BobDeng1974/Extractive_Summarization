@entity0 has put up instructions telling foreign staff how to use the loo , with details such as ' sit on the toilet - do not stand on it ' , and ' please flush it with your hand and not your foot '			1
with the help of diagrams , workers are shown how to open the door using their hand , and are requested not to leave toilet roll on the door handle			1
the instructions , put up in @entity0 's @entity20 office in central @entity21 , give full instructions of @entity24 etiquette in the lavatory , including ' the sinks are for washing your hands only - no using hand towels or toilet paper as a plug '			1
please do not stand on the toilet : @entity0 has put up instructions on @entity24 loo etiquette for foreign workers other tips including toilet - users to throw used loo roll down the loo , rather than put it in a bin , but telling them to do the opposite with plastic cups			1
the instructions are there for workers from around the world with different toilet habits			2
for example in south @entity51 , it is common to put used toilet roll into a bin beside the loo because few houses have sophisticated drains that can cope with loo roll			1
and in continental @entity59 , squatting over a ' hole - in - the - ground ' toilet has been the norm until very recently			0
the poster has gone up in several @entity0 offices , and a spokesman said today : ' we take the health and safety of our colleagues very seriously			0
' the high street bank is just the latest business to acknowledge the different toilet habits of workers from overseas - factories across the country are reportedly putting up posters detailing @entity24 loo etiquette as more workers arrive from overseas			1
last week @entity77 reported how a @entity79 warehouse in @entity80 had installed a @entity82 - style ' hole in the ground ' loo because foreign workers kept breaking the @entity87 - style loo seat by standing on it			2
when managers at the depot , a distribution centre for @entity93 , realised that their employees from @entity59 preferred squatting while going to the loo , they ordered a toilet to match their requirements			0
@entity99 style : a squat toilet has been installed in a @entity79 distribution warehouse in @entity80 ( file photo ) a source said the new loo was installed after instructions telling staff how to use an @entity87 loo went ignored , saying : ' staff were fed up with the toilet seats breaking and workers leaving a mess			2
' @entity24 visitors to @entity59 often complain about the lack of sit - down toilets , particularly in motorway service stations and bus and railway stations			0
but @entity24 - style loos are comparatively rare in some countries including @entity120 and @entity121 , where they were only introduced recently			0
however , squat loos may be set to gain in popularity in @entity24 , thanks to doctors who claim that the squatting posture brings health benefits			0
some medics believe that squatting while going to the toilet is a more ' natural ' position , and could protect against disease .			0
