by @entity1 reporter published : 12:00 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 14:40 est , 21 october 2013 the withered corpse of an elephant cow lies next to the decomposing carcass of her calf in this horrifying image of what could be the worst massacre of wildlife in almost a quarter of a century			0
illegal hunters have killed more than 300 elephants , and numerous other safari animals , in @entity15 's largest national park by poisoning waterholes with cyanide			1
the result of the indiscriminate killing has wiped out wildlife in great swathes of the once untouched wilderness of @entity23 reserve which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists each year			2
devastation : elephant cow lies beside the rotting corpses of two calves which had been poisoned by ivory poachers conservationists have been particularly concerned by the ruthless use of cyanide by poachers to kill they prey			2
the animals were struck down when ‘ salt licks ’ next to pools where they drink and bathe were contaminated with the deadly chemical			2
one hunter told @entity40 : ' we could n't believe our eyes			0
we thought at first that they must have been shot			0
there were too many to have died of thirst or hunger			0
we found that elephants we saw from the air were not shot , but the tusks were gone			2
' after the elephants died , often collapsing just a few yards from the source , lions , hyenas and vultures which fed on their carcasses were also struck down , as were other animals such as kudu and buffalo that shared the same waterholes			1
horror : this sickening image shows an elephant cow with a calf both of which were poisoned after consuming contaminated water elephants need salt to survive and the hunters cynically knew they would be drawn to the poison			1
dozens of elephants were found in @entity15 ’s @entity74 with bloody gaps where their tusks had been ripped out			1
@entity15 is home to some of @entity79 ’s largest elephant herds , with half of its estimated 80,000 population thought to be in @entity23			2
the sprawling 5,657 - square mile park is one of the few places in @entity79 to have escaped the rapid decline in the continent ’s elephant population			0
demand for elephants ' tusks , which sell for around £ 300 each to cross-border traders , is thought to be encouraging destitute villages to take the drastic action			1
they can be resold in @entity79 for up to £ 10,000 a pair , according to court papers relating one recent incident , sometimes re-emerging as carved artefacts such as bangles in @entity101 's craft markets			1
carnage : three fresh carcasses lie next to those of two poisoned a year earlier in a horrifying scene repeated across @entity15 countryside the poisoning was first uncovered by a @entity109 hunter and his @entity15 guides who spotted a dead cow and her calf as they flew over the park in a helicopter			2
so far , 14 people have been arrested since the first poisoning was discovered			2
when police arrived at the sites they found the mutilated bodies of elephants strewn around			0
the poisonings occurred in july when the national park ’s security forces , which protect herds from the ever - present threat from ivory poachers , were switched to covering the @entity15 general election and its aftermath			1
threatened : more than 300 elephants have been wiped out by poisoning in @entity74 , @entity15			1
( file photo ) since discovering the carcasses , police and rangers have searched villages close to the park and recovered 19 tusks , cyanide and wire snares			0
nine alleged poachers were arrested			0
a @entity79 businessman has also been accused of being behind the poisonings			0
police claim that he used a @entity15 farmer and an ivory buyer to distribute cyanide to villagers			1
@entity150 , @entity15 ’s environment minister , said the country was clamping down on ivory poachers as it tries to revive its tourism industry which has suffered years of decline			1
‘ we are declaring war on the poachers , ’ he said			0
‘ we are responding with all our might because our wildlife , including the elephants they are killing , are part of the natural resources and wealth that we want to benefit the people of @entity15			1
’ mr @entity150 said he would push for stiff penalties for convicted poachers , who routinely get less than the nine - year jail term imposed for cattle rustling			0
a wide range of other animal carcasses were also found near the contaminated watering holes , including buffalo , lions , vultures , antelopes and jackals			1
demand : @entity15 is home to @entity79 's largest elephant herds - and have proves rich pickings for poachers who can sell tusks hundreds of dollars			1
( file photo ) and last night there were fears that more animals could die in coming weeks as anything that feasted on the elephants ’ toxic carcasses could have also become poisoned			0
a spokesman for the @entity191 said : ‘ when other animals and birds feed on the rotting elephant carcasses , they will also die from the poison			0
hundreds of animals are now at risk			0
’ @entity199 , which accounts for 40 per cent of the world ’s trade in elephant tusks , is said to be one of the main markets for the @entity15 ivory , where it has been regarded as a symbol of wealth and status for thousands of years .			1
