her best friend had just died of cancer and she had been in and out of hospital having painful surgery			1
so by the end of 2012 , @entity5 was feeling emotionally drained , rundown and unhealthy			1
the 25 - year - old was eating badly , drinking too much and lacking self - confidence			1
@entity5 dropped from 10st 7lbs ( left ) to 9st 2lbs ( right ) while taking part in a body makeover challenge she also felt lethargic , she lacked energy and her immune system was struggling			1
so , ms @entity5 , who lives in @entity15 , decided it was time to focus on improving her mental and physical health			1
along with her boyfriend , @entity18 , she signed up for a @entity19			1
run by the supplement company @entity22 , the challenge saw the pair attempt to improve their health and lifestyles as much as possible in three months			2
ms @entity5 , an executive assistant at @entity26 , said : ‘ i needed something to focus on physically and mentally			1
‘ i did it to get my health right because i had n’t been looking after myself , and i needed to sort out my health			2
her boyfriend , @entity18 , also took on the challenge and he dropped from 13st 3lbs ( left ) to 11st 6lbs ( right ) ‘ i saw it not as a diet , but as a mental and physical lifestyle change			1
' mr @entity18 added : ' i generally did n't feel good in myself , physically and mentally			1
' my energy levels were always low and i could never concentrate for very long			2
' it got to the point were i knew i had hit rock bottom			2
' i had to make a change and i knew it needed to be a big one			2
my entire lifestyle needed a total overhaul			2
before : breakfast : nothing lunch : a chicken and mayonnaise baguette followed by some chocolate dinner : spaghetti carbonara drinks : a bottle of wine three or four evenings a week after : breakfast : porridge mid-morning : eggs with spinach lunch : chicken stir fry mid-afternoon : lean meat with vegetables dinner : a protein shake drinks : water and coffee - very little alcohol ' i was browsing through the internet and stumbled on the @entity22 makeover challenge			0
' it was exactly what i needed			0
i have always been a very competitive person and since this was a competition i thought that would help give me the added motivation to stick with it			0
' at the start of the challenge , in january 2013 , ms @entity5 weighed 10st 7lbs and was feeling lethargic and unhealthy as a result of drinking too much and eating too much stodgy food			1
she had stopped looking after herself properly because she had had an incredibly tough year			2

we were very , very close			0
‘ it is still very difficult – very raw			0

i felt bad because i was n’t at home with her			0
’ she added : ‘ i ate really badly and i got ill a lot because my immune system was weak			0
the couple took on the challenge after realising they were not looking after themselves very well and that it was affecting their physical and mental health ( they are pictured before ) ms @entity5 and mr @entity18 say that since they revolutionised their diets ( pictured ) they feel more confident and healthier			1
mr @entity18 says he is now less tired and ms @entity5 says her hair and nails are better ‘ i did n’t feel good and so i would then eat more comfort food which just made it worse			1
‘ by the start of the new year in 2013 i knew i needed to sort out my bad habits and improve my health			1
’ ms @entity5 signed up for the @entity137 and set about changing her life			1
she started to eat every three hours , instead of just having two big meals a day			2
she also gave up alcohol and started following a strict exercise and weights regime			2
her diet was revolutionised when she started eating porridge for breakfast , eggs and spinach mid-morning and a chicken stir fry for lunch			1
mid-afternoon she would eat some lean meat with vegetables , followed by a protein shake for dinner			0
after three months following this programme , she had lost 1st 5lbs to drop to 9st 2lbs			2
