by @entity0 @entity2 's patience with manager @entity3 is being driven by an increasing belief that he was handed a questionable behind - the - scenes legacy by his predecessor sir @entity6			1
one club source said @entity9 , ‘ it was like looking behind the curtain of the @entity12 and seeing there was nothing there to work with ’			0
united fans have grown increasingly disillusioned with @entity3 in recent days as a disappointing season got a lot worse with 3 - 0 home defeats by @entity20 and @entity21			1
however , @entity46 understands that one reason why chief executive @entity48 and fellow board members are giving @entity3 so much time and patience is that they feel he inherited a set - up from @entity6 that was not fit for purpose at @entity55 level			1
nobody at the club wants publicly to sully @entity6 ’s legacy , given that his 27 - year reign lifted @entity2 from oblivion to the summit of @entity63 football			1
he also left @entity3 a squad that had just won the league by 11 points			2
but it has since emerged that he ran @entity2 ’s football operation in such a closed - off way that the board believe the task of restructuring required to bring it up to speed with the rest of @entity76 ’s top clubs is much harder than expected			1
boiling point : a fan attempts to confront @entity3 during the awful 3 - 0 defeat against @entity21 grounds for concern : a plane will fly over @entity83 on saturday to show discontent towards @entity85 differences of opinion : the derided ' @entity89 ' banner will stay up at @entity83 for now contrast : @entity3 ( left ) holds his head in his hands as the @entity21 bench go wild in the derby patience pays : @entity96 is willing to afford the beleaguered @entity3 more time to turn things around @entity3 has begun the process — especially in terms of scouting and recruitment — but @entity48 believes the job of doing this has influenced the dismal events on the field			1
this is why the club wants — if at all possible — to give @entity3 the summer to put his own plans into action and recruit his own players			2
@entity2 know this strategy is not without risk and further bad results may force their hand			2
they plan to spend up to £ 200million on new players and nobody can blame recent bad performances on anyone but the man in charge			0
nevertheless , the @entity2 source said : ‘ sir @entity6 had such a hold on the club that he was left to get on with it			1
his methods worked for him			0
‘ it was always known that @entity3 would have things to address behind the scenes but there has been much , much more and it has taken longer than was anticipated			2
’ not happy : @entity6 has frequently seen his old side get beaten , particularly at home , this season when will it end ? @entity3 has presided over @entity2 's worst ever @entity55 campaign this season looking ahead : @entity3 had a three - hour meeting with @entity137 last week as they plan for next year not around much longer : @entity3 expects @entity139 ( left ) to retire and @entity140 is off to @entity141 @entity3 had a three - hour meeting with @entity137 last week , the day after @entity2 beat @entity143 3 - 0 in the @entity42 to set up next week ’s clash with old foes @entity43			1
a sign of growing divisions among supporters is that one group have raised £ 840 to fly a plane over @entity83 during the match with @entity152 tomorrow with the banner : ‘ @entity154 — @entity155 ’			0
this is a direct challenge to the @entity158 group , who have refused to take down their ‘ @entity89 ’ banner inside the ground			0
if @entity3 survives the turbulent days ahead , he has a list of players he wishes to move out of the club			2
these include midfielders @entity167 , @entity169 and @entity170 and defender @entity171			0
@entity85 will also listen to good offers for @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			0
meanwhile , @entity140 is leaving for @entity141 and @entity3 expects to lose @entity177 to @entity178 and @entity139 and @entity179 to retirement			0
off elsewhere ? @entity179 completed a takeover of @entity182 on thursday as he heads for retirement			0

@entity2 's patience with @entity3 derives from *misgivings* over sir @entity6 's legacy
@entity2 fans are growing disillusioned with new boss
but the club 's board are willing to stick by their man
@entity46 understands @entity48 believes the set - up @entity3 inherited was *n't* fit for purpose
