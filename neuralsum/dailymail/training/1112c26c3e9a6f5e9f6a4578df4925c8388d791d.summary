by @entity0 for @entity1 wrapped up in a dark coat , balaclava and sunglasses , @entity2 cuts an unusual figure as she visits her local supermarket to do her weekly shop			2
but her strange choice of attire is not meant to hide her face , masking her identity			0
rather it is designed to protect the 58 - year - old , who must live in the dark for a month , while she trials a new drug to treat her cancer			2
mrs @entity2 is the first patient to take part in the international trial of the drug @entity20 , which , it is hoped , will be used to treat patients with inoperable bile duct cancer			1
@entity2 , 38 , may look like a robber but actually her balaclava and sunglasses are because she is taking part in a trial of new drug @entity20			2
@entity20 is reactive to light , and could be used to treat patients with inoperable bile duct cancer she was given the drug by doctors at @entity32 in @entity33 , which is the first in the world to trial @entity20			1
the drug , which enters into the cancerous cells themselves , is taken alongside chemotherapy			1
it reacts to light so doctors warned she had to stay in hospital for two weeks before going home			2
they said she had to cover her body completely when going outdoors			0
it prompted the 58 - year - old to opt for sunglasses and a balaclava , as well as a pair of gloves , when she steps outside			0
ms @entity2 said the outfit made shopping quite difficult initially			0
she said : ‘ i got some funny looks when i went to the supermarket			0
' i had someone go with me at first because with the dark glasses on i could n’t tell the difference between a tomato and a beetroot			0
' and when i went to the hairdressers , one lady ran out screaming – she must have thought i was going to blow the place up			0
' ms @entity2 , a care assistant living in @entity65 , north @entity66 , found out she had bile duct cancer after she had a serious bout of vomiting last december			1
she noticed her skin was turning yellow and so sought help			0
bile duct cancer is a rare but aggressive type of cancer			1
@entity74 is the medical term sometimes used for bile duct cancer			1
in most cases , there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages , when symptoms can include : see your gp if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms			1
while it is unlikely you will have bile duct cancer , it is best to get it checked			2
source : @entity95 ‘ i went to my local hospital in @entity66 for a scan and they initially told me it was a gall bladder stone ’ she said			0
however , at a follow - up appointment , she was told that the situation was more serious			0
she was referred to a hospital in @entity33 and was diagnosed with bile duct cancer after two weeks of tests			1
following her diagnosis , ms @entity2 met with dr @entity106 , clinical director of digestive diseases at @entity108 in @entity33 , who told her about the @entity20 trial			1
she felt the drug might help and wanted to take part			0
she said : ‘ i wanted to get involved straight away			0
i had nothing to lose and so much to gain			0
' i have four sisters and a brother in @entity33 and they were all supportive			0
’ before beginning her chemotherapy treatment , which she receives three times a month at the @entity120 in @entity121 , she had had @entity20 injected into her system and ‘ activated ’ at @entity32 in @entity33			1
@entity20 works by entering cancerous cells within tumours			1
it is then ‘ activated ’ by inserting a laser into the bile duct , which illuminates the area where the bile duct cancer occurs			1
doctors hope this will enhance the effects of traditional chemotherapy by targeting individual tumours rather than treating the patient ’s whole body			2
@entity20 , which is produced by @entity137 company @entity136 , is already used in the treatment of some other cancers but has never been used to treat bile duct cancer before			1
care assistant ms @entity2 , who lives in @entity65 in north wales , was diagnosed with bile duct cancer in november after she noticed she was turning yellow and was suffering a bout of vomitting the study involves hospitals across @entity146 but @entity108 is the lead site			1
dr @entity106 , who referred ms @entity2 for the @entity20 trial said : ‘ i ’m delighted that our patients have had the opportunity to benefit from this research study			1
as a hospital , we are committed to cutting - edge research			0
‘ @entity157 cancer is a devastating disease with a very clear need of better , alternative treatments			0
' it has a remarkable resistance to conventional treatment and this trial represents an innovative concept that could potentially improve the length and quality of life for patients			2

@entity2 , 58 , was diagnosed with bile duct cancer last november
doctors at @entity32 told her about @entity20 trial
patient is injected with @entity20 then it is ' activated ' using a laser
@entity20 works by entering into cancerous cells and illuminating them
the treatment is taken alongside chemotherapy and is thought to enhance it
drug reacts to light so patients have to cover up when going outside
