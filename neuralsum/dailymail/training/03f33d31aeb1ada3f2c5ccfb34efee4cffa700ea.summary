a police officer was spotted turning heads on a @entity3 beach for his choice of transport			2
contrasting greatly with the bikini - clad beach - goers , senior constable @entity6 was seen in a full length uniform , topped off with a helmet , as he rode a segway across the sand of @entity13 beach in @entity14			2
senior sergeant @entity15 told @entity16 that the two - wheeled electric vehicle was often used to patrol beaches and boardwalks in the area			1
' it 's a new technology for new police and the guy enjoys using it and finds it quite convenient			0
' mr @entity6 said the @entity23 attracted people 's attention whenever he used it , particularly that of tourists			0

' it 's good fun on the beach , especially when it 's busy and you ca n't really drive or walk - the @entity23 is pretty good to get around and get between people , ' mr @entity6 said			0
while most sun - bathers waved back at the policeman as he passed by , many more could n't help but stare admiringly at the officers wheels ' tourists love it and lots of people want to take photos , especially as it has police signage and flashing lights			1
' the @entity63 officer said his segway could drive 18km/h , the pace of a fast jogger , and that although he was yet to chase anyone with it he had been called to jobs with it that had resulted in arrests			0
