a man recently whose murder conviction was overturned is now seeking $ 100million in damages in a federal civil rights lawsuit against seven police detectives , a prosecutor turned judge and a former police chief			1
the 50 - page suit says @entity9 , @entity11 police fabricated evidence against @entity13 , bullied witnesses and ignored other leads in their investigation into the 2001 killing of @entity18 , a @entity19 sports editor			1
the lawsuit , filed monday in @entity21 for the @entity22 of @entity11 , asks for actual damages of $ 75million and compensatory damages of $ 25million			2
ten years to the day : the lawsuit was filed on tuesday which is the 10th anniversary of when @entity13 ( pictured ) was first taken into a police interrogation for the 2001 murder of @entity18 it also names the city of @entity9 , its police department , @entity31 and two investigators for the county prosecutor 's office			1
@entity13 spent nearly a decade in prison but was released in november 2013 after an appeals court panel ruled that prosecutors wrongly withheld evidence from the defense			2
@entity11 's attorney general opted to not retry @entity13 , who has since moved to @entity40 to avoid the glare of attention in his hometown			2
his case gained national attention because his high school classmate , @entity46 , claimed to have recalled through dreams years after the fact that he and @entity13 had killed @entity18 during a late - night robbery after a @entity50 of partying			1
@entity46 has since recanted his testimony but is still in prison			0
@entity13 says his former high school classmate is also innocent			0
fighting for civil rights : @entity13 's lawyer @entity55 , seen beside him in a 2012 hearing , and they named seven police detectives , a prosecutor turned judge and a former police chief in the lawsuit after his release , @entity13 received a veritable hero 's welcome in @entity9 at a celebratory news conference , with his new girlfriend by his side			1
but the lawsuit suggests @entity13 has faced a difficult adjustment			2
' @entity13 's new identity upon walking out of prison is that of a 29 - year - old uneducated , jobless man without health care or funds for psychological counseling , ' the suit said			2
killer at large : the @entity50 night murder of @entity18 was a mystery until police began to suspect @entity13 and his friend in 2004 ' for years he was branded as a brutal murderer and those scars can not be excised			1
' @entity83 spokeswoman @entity82 , who is the only police officer named in the lawsuit who still works for the department , and circuit judge @entity87 , who prosecuted @entity13 , did not immediately respond to interview requests			2
former @entity9 police chief @entity89 referred a request for comment to the city attorney , who was unavailable tuesday			0
as in @entity13 's successful appeal , the civil rights complaint raises questions about the possible involvement of @entity97 , a one - time @entity19 sports writer			1
@entity97 has provided conflicting statements about when he left work the night of @entity18 's murder and changed his accounts of which of two cars he was driving that night			0
the new suit says papers belonging to @entity97 were found at the crime scene , and that @entity97 and @entity18 had a ' major dispute ' over a mistake made by @entity97 on an assignment from his boss			0
@entity97 , who is now sports editor of the @entity110 in southeastern @entity11 , declined a request for comment			1
he has denied playing any role in @entity18 's death and testified at @entity13 's appeal only after attorney @entity55 agreed to not discuss @entity97 as a potential suspect at the hearing			0
the civil rights suit was filed on the 10th anniversary of @entity13 's first police interrogation			1
freedom : @entity13 , who is now 29 , has since moved to @entity40 since being freed in @entity9 , @entity11 celebrating every moment : @entity13 is seen here with his girlfriend @entity124 and a relative after his second month of freedom ' i found myself in an interrogation room being threatened and lied to by the very people we expect to protect us , ' he wrote on the @entity131			1
' the people whose ( sole ) responsibility it is to seek justice ... at least that 's the common misperception portrayed to the public			0
' ' ten years ago today , i never would have believed i 'd end up spending almost my entire twenties in prison for a crime i had nothing to do with			0
an apology would be nice though			0
' @entity13 was a 17 - year - old high school junior at the time of @entity18 's slaying			0
he was convicted in 2005 and had been serving a 40 - year sentence for murder and robbery .			0
