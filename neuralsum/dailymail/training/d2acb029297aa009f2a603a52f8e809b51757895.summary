@entity1 forward @entity0 has completed his loan move to @entity3 for the rest of the season			1
the 27 - year - old @entity6 will go straight into contention for @entity3 's @entity9 trip to @entity10 on saturday			2
@entity3 boss @entity11 is expected to continue to seek another loan recruit to bolster his frontline in the january window , despite recruiting @entity0			1
@entity1 forward @entity0 has penned a loan deal at @entity3 this month @entity0 admitted he seized the chance to ' show what i can do ' in the @entity9 with @entity3 , after a frustrating run since joining @entity1 last summer			1
i need this , i need to play and @entity3 have given me this chance to show what i can do , ' said @entity0			1
' the @entity9 is the best in the world at this moment			0
' does my style suit the @entity9 ? maybe			0
we will see ! ' when i met the manager he told me he wanted to sign me for @entity30 before , but in that moment i went to @entity32			1
but now i am here and will play for him			0
the @entity6 was the first of nine signings made by @entity1 in the summer but has n't nailed down a spot ' i will try to do different things with the ball , some skills to make the difference for the team , for me and for the other players			2
i am fit and i hope i can be involved on saturday			0
' @entity0 scored two goals in eight appearances for @entity1 following his switch from @entity47 last summer			1
the former @entity32 and @entity48 forward made a strong early impression at the @entity1 , but has failed to edge his way past @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 in recent weeks			2
@entity11 will hope @entity0 can boost @entity3 's goal threat alongside prolific striker @entity55 in the @entity57 's @entity9 survival fight			1
@entity3 boss @entity11 has labelled @entity1 outcast @entity60 a ' clever no 10 ' ' we 're really pleased to bring @entity0 in			1
he 's a good footballer , someone with great ability who can play as a number 10 , ' said @entity11			0
' i first saw him when he was on loan at @entity66 quite a few years back and i actually tried to take him to @entity30 back then			2
' he 's a more - than capable player , he 's already shown that , and hopefully he can come in here and do well for us			0
' @entity11 looks to have missed out on signing @entity69 once again , with @entity3 restricted to loan recruits this month			1
@entity11 appears to have failed in signing @entity69 from @entity71 in the @entity72 @entity71 striker @entity69 remains a target for a host of @entity9 clubs , with the 32 - year - old keen on a return to @entity77			0
the @entity79 club are holding out for a full transfer to let @entity69 leave however , ruling @entity3 out of the running			0
@entity11 will continue to scout around for another loan striker this month despite bringing in @entity60 however			2
former bricklayer @entity83 is the @entity9 's top @entity86 goal scorer with 12 strikes to his name this term , but @entity11 is keen not to leave his prize asset isolated			0
@entity91 has continued to link play effectively but can not last an entire match because of long - term and ongoing hip problems			0
@entity11 will be hoping @entity0 will lift the pressure of @entity3 striker @entity55 by scoring goals			1
