dogs are digging up the corpses of @entity4 victims buried in shallow graves in @entity6 and eating them in the street , villagers have claimed			1
furious residents of @entity9 , outside capital @entity10 , raised the alarm after packs of wild dogs were spotted digging up corpses from a specially - designated ' @entity4 graveyard ' , dragging them into the open and feeding on their flesh			1
it is the latest development in the epidemic , which was today confirmed to have reached @entity19			2
the grisly scenes in @entity6 came three weeks after government health officials - desperate to stem the country 's rising infection rate - hurriedly buried the bodies despite a heated standoff with villagers who refused to give their permission to use the land			1
but rather than resolve the dispute , @entity6 's @entity32 burial team dug the graves at night to avoid further confrontation , making the infected bodies easy targets for scavengers , villagers say			1
' we are very disappointed in the @entity51 , especially the government that took an oath to defend and protect us , ' @entity52 told @entity55			0
' to see them act in such manner is unacceptable and we ’ll never allow the government come to bury any longer			0
' he added : ' they will be resisted by us because i think the government has failed to protect us			0
why bring @entity4 bodies and not bury them well ? ' while the dogs are unlikely to grow sick from the virus , there is a strong chance they could still pass it on to humans , dr. @entity64 of the @entity66 ’s medical virology division told @entity73			1
death toll rising : a @entity6 health worker sprays disinfectant outside a house before entering and removing the body of a man that they believe died from the ebola virus in @entity10 high death rate : so far @entity4 has killed more than 1,500 of the 3,000 people it has sickened in @entity85 , @entity6 , @entity86 and @entity87 , according to an official count grisly task : two nurses in protective suits enter a @entity6 village to search for locals who have fallen ill infected : they escort an infected villager away , watched by a crowd of concerned locals ' [ the dogs ' ] infections appear to be asymptomatic , ' he said			1
' this means that dogs wo n’t get sick , but they still could carry a potential risk through licking or biting			1
' the news comes as it was revealed the killer disease has reached @entity19 , making it the fifth @entity46 country to be affected by the outbreak			1
the country 's @entity32 said a man infected with @entity4 traveled to @entity19 , bringing the disease to that country for the first time in an outbreak that has hit four other @entity46 nations and killed more than 1,500 people			1
health minister @entity114 told reporters that the infected person , a university student from @entity85 , sought treatment at a hospital in @entity19 's capital , @entity120 , on tuesday but gave no indication he might have @entity4			1
the next day , an epidemiological surveillance team in @entity85 alerted @entity19 authorities that they had lost track of a person who had had contact with sick people			1
the team said that the person disappeared three weeks ago and may have come to @entity19			2
spreading : @entity19 's health minister , @entity114 ( pictured ) , revealed today that @entity4 had reached @entity19 capital @entity120 after a university student from @entity85 checked into hospital there on tuesday fears : the news comes as scientists claimed the ebola virus disease is rapidly and continually mutating , making it harder to diagnose and treat the student was tracked to the hospital in @entity120 that same day and was immediately quarantined , @entity114 said			1
a test has confirmed that he has @entity4 , and the @entity142 has been alerted			2
@entity4 emerged in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in @entity144 and near the @entity145 in the @entity146			2
there are several strains which vary in how dangerous they are to humans , but death rates have reached as high as 90 per cent			2
in the current outbreak it is just over 50 per cent			0
the virus is introduced into humans through direct contact with the blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals including fruit bats , which are eaten as a delicacy , and possibly now dogs			1
the virus then spreads between humans through direct contact with blood , organs or other bodily fluids of infected people			2
symptoms include fever , intense weakness , muscle pain , headache and sore throat followed by vomiting , diarrhoea , rash , impaired kidney and liver function , and in some cases , both internal and external bleeding			0
people are infectious as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus and the incubation period can range between two and 21 days			0
although the disease has no cure , modern medical treatment and quick isolation help hugely to bring the death toll down			0
source : @entity142 and in a further blow to the fight against the outbreak , scientists today claimed the ebola virus disease is rapidly and continually mutating , making it harder to diagnose and treat			0
a study of the initial patients diagnosed with the virus in @entity87 revealed almost 400 genetic modifications			0
and it could be detrimental not only to current treatments , but also to future vaccines that are in the works			0
the team of researchers , led by the @entity206 in @entity207 and @entity208 , analysed more than 99 ebola virus genomes			0
also today , the @entity142 revealed that the past week has seen the highest increase of @entity4 cases since the outbreak in @entity46 began			1
the @entity214 health agency warned yesterday that the outbreak in @entity46 is accelerating and could eventually infect as many as 20,000 people			0
so far it has killed more than 1,500 of the 3,000 people it has sickened in @entity85 , @entity6 , @entity86 and @entity87 , according to an official count			0
the @entity214 health agency said yesterday it assumes that in many hard - hit areas , the actual number of cases may be two to four times higher than is currently reported			0
in a detailed report on the outbreak published today , the @entity142 said more than 500 cases were recorded over the past week , by far the worst toll of any week so far			2
the vast majority of the cases were in @entity6 , but the agency said it was also the highest number of cases in one week for @entity85 and @entity87			2
@entity86 has also recorded a small number of cases .			0
