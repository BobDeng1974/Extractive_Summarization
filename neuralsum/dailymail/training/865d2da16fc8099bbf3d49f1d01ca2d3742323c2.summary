' it was my first ever scuba dive and i could n’t wait to see the amazing sea life , i was fascinated as soon as i saw the fish so headed towards it			2
' but it did n’t seem to notice me as it was very interested in the camera so i swam over slowly expecting it to notice me , these type of fish are very friendly with divers so i was n’t nervous about approaching it			0
' as i got really close , i thought i would swim alongside it , which was when the picture was taken			0
' after appearing to be frightened off , the fish turned back to investigate mr @entity12 and his diving gear mr @entity12 said the fish was very interested in his camera , which meant he was able to capture the images			1

@entity21 - born @entity12 captured the image on his first ever dive
