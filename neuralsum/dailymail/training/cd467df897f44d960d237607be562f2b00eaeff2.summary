mr @entity1 was fired in 2012 after a hearing which found he had lied about his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman @entity20 's daughter			2
in march , mr @entity6 was dismissed in march after six counts of gross misconduct were upheld , including the misuse of a corporate credit card			2
both men had denied any wrongdoing			2
the officers were entitled to the payments under the terms of their contracts			1
a police spokeswoman said the strict rules that determine when a pension can be forfeited are set out in law			0
' to be considered , a person has to be convicted in court of specific criminal offences			2
these are : treason , offences under the @entity40 with a sentence of at least ten years , or a criminal offence connected to service which is liable to lead to serious loss of public confidence , or is gravely injurious to the interests of the secretary of state			2
forfeiture proceedings have to be approved by the home secretary			0
' revocation or reduction of pensionable pay can therefore only occur if an officer is convicted in court of one of these criminal offences			0

' the former chief constable said he was still looking forward to clearing his name			1
' a number of witnesses have now approached me who could not help at the time , due to restrictions placed upon them by the @entity9 criminal investigation , which cost £ 5m of taxpayers money and was ultimately completely ill founded and unsuccessful			1
both officers were arrested in 2011 as part of @entity9 , the £ 4.6m investigation into allegations of corruption at the @entity105 and the now - defunct police authority which resulted in no criminal charges ' statements are in the process of being obtained from these witnesses			1
the legal advice i have received is that is that this new evidence " was not or could not have been considered by the misconduct panel at the time " and provides grounds to appeal against my dismissal , even after the time that has passed			0
