by @entity0 published : 20:38 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 01:53 est , 30 november 2013 toy boxes , silver rattles and the odd savings bond are all par for the course when celebrating the birth of a new baby			2
fortunately @entity12 ’s parents , the @entity9 and @entity10 , are equally delighted at the gift of a fatted calf and goat they received in honour of their son ’s birth from tribesman in @entity22 this month			1
the couple have now formally accepted the present , considered a great honour in the local culture , and have even responded with a letter written in @entity28 thanking the elders for their ‘ extraordinary generosity			1
’ @entity31 and @entity10 have been gifted a fatted bull calf and a goat by @entity22 's @entity35 people to honour the birth of @entity12 the gift of a fattened black bull and goat was made last week by the @entity35 people of @entity22 , whom @entity31 has spent much time with in recent years when staying on the @entity43 at the foothills of @entity22			1
he and his wife also got engaged nearby			2
after discussions between the prince ’s representatives and local cultural leaders , it has been agreed to use the bull to start a new ‘ royal herd ’			1
there has , by all accounts , now been an offer of four heifers to go with the bull , and the @entity58 ( @entity58 ) have agreed to keep the animals on @entity43			1
in a traditional @entity35 ceremony to celebrate the birth of @entity12 , elders blessed the animals while their womenfolk conducted traditional dances to celebrate the birth of a new born child			1
@entity68 high commissioner , dr @entity67 , even travelled to @entity69 on @entity70 ’s behalf to be there for the ceremony			0
the @entity35 people of @entity22 sent the royals the unusual gift to celebrate the birth of @entity12 in recognition of the honour , @entity31 sent the community a message of thanks , which read : ‘ @entity78 , @entity12 , @entity79 na @entity80 , ukarimu wenu na pia kwa zawadi zenu			1
’ in translation it read : ‘ on behalf of our son @entity12 , @entity79 and i would like to thank you all so very much for the extraordinary honour and generosity of your gifts			0
’ the rest of the letter continued in @entity92 : ‘ i remember my time with you , the @entity35 , with immense happiness and i could not be more grateful to you all for this kindness			1
it brings me great pride and joy to know that @entity12 ’s ‘ pension ’ will be herded on a land that we love and care deeply for			0

‘ @entity108 [ thank you ]			0
’ ties : @entity31 has spent much time with the @entity35 in recent years when staying on the @entity43 at the foothills of @entity22			1
he and his wife also got engaged at a lodge ( pictured ) nearby cattle , which are used for milk not meat , are very important to @entity118 tribesman and the subject of mystical beliefs and reverence			0
mythology tells of a time when the earth and sky were joined together , until they were suddenly torn apart , with only the wild fig trees left as bridges between the two			2
as a gift , @entity128 - called @entity131 - sent herds of cattle down through these trees to earth			2
cattle are , therefore , sacred and a direct gift from the heavens			2
grass is also considered a blessing and sacred			0
when passing a fig tree , it is customary for tribesmen to push handfuls of grass between the roots , as homage to the source of their herds			0
one of the more common greetings is ‘ i hope your cattle are well ’ .			0
