by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 18:08 est , 1 january 2013 pet hate : @entity3 presenter sir @entity2 bemoans his lack of ability to open a tin of sardines on @entity9 's @entity8 his wry observations on the absurdities and dilemmas encountered in life helped to turn sir @entity2 into a household name			1
now the 74 year old broadcaster has turned his attention to the daily battle his generation faces with difficult packaging			2
from the sardine tin that wo n’t open to the toothpaste enclosed in fortress - like plastic , sir @entity2 does not hold back from voicing his frustration in the new series of @entity9 ’s @entity8			1
discussing his pet hates with host @entity27 , sir @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s food packaging in particular – with sardines or pilchards in a tin you put your finger in the ring thing , dislocate your finger and break your nails			1
‘ then the damn thing comes away and you ’ve got to get a tin opener anyway , all for a sardine			0
‘ then there are those bottles where you have to press down the top before you can open them … ’ and the kitchen is n’t the only place in the house sir @entity2 faces the perils of packaging			1
he continued : ‘ taking things further it becomes very difficult to open things when you get to my distinguished age			0
‘ has anyone tried to break into a toothbrush lately ? ‘ you ’re in the bathroom and you think , ‘ i ’ll restore my dentures to their pristine glory ’			0
i ’ve got a new toothbrush here but can i open it ? ’ during the programme , which will be broadcast later this month ( jan 11 ) , mr @entity27 is far from sympathetic to sir @entity2 ’s plight , telling him : ‘ it ’s made me realise why old people get up so early			1
’ with a career spanning five decades in showbusiness , sir @entity2 has no designs to settle into retirement			1
earlier this year he presented seven hours of live tv for the @entity9 ’s annual @entity73 appeal and still has his own @entity3 show @entity75			1
@entity76 : one of sir @entity2 's pet hates is opening a tin of sardines sir @entity2 , who was knighted by the @entity80 in 2005 , has been married to his ex-model wife , @entity81 for 47 years and they have two sons and a daughter : @entity85 , 45 , @entity86 42 , and @entity87 , 40			1
his rant on packaging comes just weeks after he urged diners to protest at the food provided by some five star establishments			2
long - running show : @entity9 's @entity8 host @entity27 listened to sir @entity2 's pet hates recalling a recent @entity97 lunch at @entity98 , he described the turkey as ‘ an indefinable lump of rolled white meat that could have been anything ’			1
‘ it was , ’ he tells me , ‘ served with sprouts like bullets , soggy potatoes and a bread sauce that would have been at home on a plasterer ’s tray			2
’ and the @entity112 - born broadcaster did n’t spare other multi-starred establishments			0
‘ i went to a saints and sinners lunch at the @entity115 recently and the turkey was unbelievable , ’ ‘ they churn out this stuff at @entity119 and nobody ever complains			0
‘ they are afraid to make a scene			0
‘ nobody ever thinks : “ we ’d better improve our standards			0
” according to the latest research , more rubbish goes to landfill in @entity129 than in any other @entity131 country			0
with items such as shrink - wrapped coconuts and single bananas sold in plastic trays			0
the law on excess packaging was introduced in 1999 and appears to offer a simple route to outlawing waste			2
it says packaging should be limited to ‘ the minimum adequate amount ’ to ensure safety and hygiene			2
however , just a handful of companies have been prosecuted , while the maximum fine is just £ 5,000 .			0
