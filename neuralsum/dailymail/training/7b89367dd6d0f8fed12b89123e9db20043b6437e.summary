fearless @entity4 appears in silhouette against the sunny woodland above , his limbs outstretched as he appears to free - fall into the gloomy cavern curving out beneath him			1
the brave @entity13 climber is in fact suspended by a rope as he abseils at speed down into the beautifully named @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , joined by climbing partner @entity20			1
terrifying descent : @entity20 prepares to take the plunge into @entity17 , a 162 - foot deep open - air vertical abyss sheer drop : @entity4 drops into the incredible cave , which bells out from 40ft in diameter to 100ft at its base , with a cool breeze blowing into it their plunge into the watery , open - air pit was documented by amateur photographer and research scientist @entity35 , using a simple $ 100 ( Â£ 60 ) automatic camera			1
' i have built up my cave photography on the idea that one does not need lots of fancy gear to get a shot , ' said the 25 - year - old			2
' it 's about the photographer skill and understanding , not about having thousands of dollars worth of gear			0
' the pit , owned by @entity48 ( @entity49 ) , is one of the most visited of its kind because of its beautiful fern - covered ledges , rare and endangered plantlife , waterfalls , and other features			1
ms @entity35 added : ' @entity57 is a beauty , i 've never seen an open - air pit quite like it			0
great depths : mr @entity61 comes to a stop at the base of @entity64 , which was bought using the donations of cavers after a fundraising drive called ' buy a piece of the pit ' ' once you get up to a bit of a flat level on the mountain , all of a sudden there is this huge 40 - foot wide in diameter pit with waterfalls cascading into it and lush greenery with a cool breeze blowing out			2
' the cave bells out to 100ft in diameter at the bottom			0
in 1995 , the @entity49 launched a major fundraising programme for the @entity87 called ' @entity88 '			0
cavers were encouraged to contribute to the fund in return for a @entity92 and an honorary certificate of ownership			0
the programme was a huge success and meant the debt from the purchase was cleared in one year			0
miss @entity35 followed mr @entity4 and mr @entity61 's progress at a slower pace , explaining : ' i abseiled slowly down the pit so i could enjoy the view			2
there are multiple levels of fern - covered ledges of brilliant green against the dark limestone rock			0
' i spent about an hour at the bottom , finding snakes and frogs and salamanders slithering about			1
' falling sunlight : brilliant rays and a waterfall pour into the deep cavern , which is filled with rare and endangered ferns all angles : talented photographer @entity35 lowered herself into the pitch - black hole at a slower pace as she captured the breathtaking pictures fantastic scenery : the fearless pair rest on a ledge at the start of their journey deep into the earth			1
