this was such a sublime obliteration that towards the end of it , @entity3 ’s many worshippers were cheering on @entity6 — a little - known @entity7 without a prayer — in the hope that he could prolong their entertainment			1
when @entity6 won a game he smiled and saluted the crowd			1
when he won a point it was met by loud applause			2
he even saved five match points			2
the only problem was that he won too few points and too few games and @entity3 was predictably victorious			1
there was to be no repeat of last year ’s humbling of a great champion ; @entity3 ’s watch - through - your - fingers second - round defeat by @entity28 , a @entity29 who was 116 in the world			1
easy win : @entity3 made short work of @entity6 on day of @entity33 praise me : @entity3 , still a darling of @entity33 , takes the acclaim of the crowd on @entity38 no , the great @entity3 won with a big ace down the middle and duly put @entity33 back on its axis here			1
it took him 24 minutes to win the first set and 1hr 33min to complete the job			2
but for @entity6 ’s fleeting , late obduracy , @entity3 could have been back home to share a late lunch with his newly - expanded family			1
his wife @entity49 was in @entity38 , clapping her man			1
the two sets of twins , @entity53 and @entity54 , aged four , and @entity55 and @entity56 , aged seven weeks , were waiting for @entity57 back at their base down the road			2
‘ it ’s nice having the family with you as much as possible , ’ he said			2
‘ they know i play a lot of tennis			2
i do n’t know if they understand it is a job			0
they know i play for a trophy and all that stuff			0
’ the chances of siring two sets of identical twins have been estimated at one in 700,000 but what of @entity3 , 32 , winning an eighth @entity33 title ? in doing that he would become the oldest champion here in the modern era , beating 31 - year - old @entity80 in 1975			1
there were no more than clues in what we saw in this first - round match but we can say that the @entity87 ’s recent upturn in form continues			1
the back problems and his patchy form of a year ago were nowhere to be seen			0
imperious : @entity3 serves on his way to victory at what has become his second home @entity33 day 2 review if he has lost a little speed with age , the delicacy of his shot - making endures			1
he said his larger racket head has given him more power on his serve			0
he volleyed more than in recent years , moving to the net regularly and confidently , and declaring that ‘ it could be that little extra piece to the puzzle ’			0
‘ i did n’t serve and volley all the time , ’ said @entity3 , who has worked on the tactic with his coach @entity107			1
‘ that ’s not how i intend to play			0
but mixing it up a little bit could be the way to go			0
’ something of the ego still sparkles , even if last year ’s defeat and the rise of @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 have stripped away part of his numinous aura			0
the white and gold blazer was nowhere to be seen ; he was merely in immaculate white			0
no answer : @entity6 was outclassed by former champion @entity3 watching brief : @entity126 watches husband @entity3 play @entity7 's @entity6 @entity127 is a good word for @entity3 , unlike the official notes issued to us hacks , which described him as ‘ the defending champion ’			1
tougher challenges await , starting with the big - serving @entity134 tomorrow			0
but for now the great @entity135 is content			0
‘ i served well , returned well and came forward a bit , ’ he said			0
‘ i could really do everything out there			0

former champion @entity3 eased into second round
@entity87 only lost five games to @entity7 @entity6 on @entity38
