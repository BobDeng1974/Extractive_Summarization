president @entity0 affirmed on wednesday his administration 's belief that the religion of violent extremists savaging @entity5 and @entity6 is not relevant and should not matter			1
there is ' no one profile of a violent extremist or terrorist , ' @entity0 said at the @entity12 's summit on counter-terror measures			1
' there is no way to predict who will come radicalized			2
' ' we are not at war with @entity19 , ' @entity0 asserted			1
' we are at war with people who have perverted @entity19			2
@entity0 used the speech to explain his administration 's position that the religion of @entity30 terrorists does n't matter the @entity12 on wednesday was blitzed by reporters demanding to know when it believes that religion is meaningful in violent attacks			1
the @entity0 administration has been loathe to refer to @entity30 as ' @entity19 radicals , ' arguing that the terrorist group 's religion does n't matter			1
furthermore , it has at times failed to mention the religion of victims of barbaric assaults while at other times featuring it front and center			0
as foreign officials descended on @entity49 for the @entity12 summit taking place next door , new life was given to the controversy and it threatened to overshadow the administration 's confab			1
a statement sent to reporters on sunday evening in which @entity12 press secretary @entity58 condemned the ' despicable and cowardly murder of twenty - one @entity61 citizens in @entity62 by @entity65 - affiliated terrorists ' jump started the debate			1
notably , @entity58 did not mention that the 21 @entity61 were @entity67 and were killed by terrorist because of their faith			0
but two days before , after three , @entity73 students were murdered in @entity74 , @entity75 , reportedly over an altercation involving a parking space , @entity0 said in a statement , ' no one in the @entity71 should ever be targeted because of who they are , what they look like , or how they worship			2
' the statement implied that the students ' religion and the assault were linked , even though local authorities had not yet come to that conclusion			0
@entity87 ( r ) , the founder of the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) in @entity89 , listens to @entity71 president @entity0 speak at the @entity24			2
' we are not at war with @entity19 , ' @entity0 asserted during his speech			1
' we are at war with people who have perverted @entity19 ' at wednesday 's press briefing @entity97 correspondent @entity96 implored @entity58 to explain why he did not say in his statement that the slaughtered @entity61 were also @entity67 and asked if the @entity12 does n't believe that information is ' relevant ' to the crime			1
' it sure is , ' @entity58 replied , ' because the @entity65 extremists who carried out this attack indicated that the reason that they were killing them , was n't just because they were @entity61 , but also because they were @entity107			0
' then why not say that ? pressed @entity96			0
' i ca n't account for that specific line in the statement , ' @entity58 said , but we 've been clear ' that we condemn the outrageous murder of these @entity61 citizens because of their @entity107 faith			0
' he pointed to an op - ed from the president that ran in the @entity119 today as proof of the administration 's position			2
in it @entity0 specifically states that ' the terrorist group we call @entity65 has slaughtered innocent civilians and murdered hostages , including @entity71 , and has spread its barbarism to @entity62 with the murder of @entity130			1
' but why , @entity96 asked , did the @entity12 feel it was necessary to immediately invoke religion when it came to the @entity73 students even though the case is still under investigation			2
the @entity12 has a principle , @entity58 said that ' regardless of the faith of the individual in question , that people should not be targeted because of their religion , and what they look like or what their last name is or how they worship			2
' @entity0 said that last friday , @entity58 said , to articulate its own believes - and one the @entity12 believes ' the vast majority of @entity71 should be able to support			1
' ' i think we 've been very clear about what we call it and why we approach it in this way , ' he said before moving on			0
@entity0 's spokesman was forced to revisit the topic of radical @entity156 several times throughout the briefing , with @entity159 's @entity158 at one point saying to him , ' it just seems like you 're tiptoeing through the tulips here ' during a back and forth about the religious undertones of the @entity12 's counterterrorism summit			1
' well i do n't think i 'm tiptoeing anywhere , ' @entity58 remarked			2
' i think we 've been pretty clear about exactly what we 're trying to fight here			0
this is the summit on countering violent extremism			0
' ' and there is no question that radical ideologues around the globe have sought , and in some cases succeeded , in infiltrating some elements of the @entity73 world to propagate their ideology and to try to distort that religion to justify their terrible acts of violence , ' he acknowledged			0
he then bought up deceased @entity183 leader @entity182 , taken out by the @entity71 in 2011			0
@entity58 contended that the @entity71 ' refusal to declare a religious war between the @entity186 and @entity19 , according to @entity182 's writings , ' was frustrating his efforts to advance his radical agenda , it was frustrating the efforts of that organization to recruit new members , and it even prompted him to even contemplate changing the name of his organization to try to get people to identify them as a religious organization , as opposed to what they are , which is a terrorist organization			1
' that revelation , made after @entity182 's death , is a ' pretty clear indication ' that the @entity12 's strategy is working , @entity58 said			1
expressing his desire ' put an end to the tiptoeing - to the extent that there 's been any , ' @entity58 said ' there is no doubt about the motivation of the individual who carried out this attack against a kosher market in @entity214			0
' he was motivated by anti-semitism , and he was targeting them because they were @entity218 , ' @entity58 said , referring to another incident in which the @entity12 muddied the waters with its changing stance on religion			2
continuing , @entity58 said , ' public statements of @entity30 in @entity62 indicated that they were killed because of their @entity107 faith			0
demonstrating the administration 's respect for religion , @entity58 noted that the @entity71 took action in @entity5 last summer to help protect the @entity230 people escape @entity30			1
the @entity71 has ' a long history , and a proud history ' of taking action to protect classes of religious and racial minorities , he said , and ' it strengthens our moral authority around the globe , and it strengthens our national security			0
' at the summit @entity0 sought to further clarify his administrations beliefs , specifically calling the students , ' three young @entity243			2
' he additionally lobbied the @entity73 community to do a better job making it clear to the world that @entity30 terrorists do not represent the whole of the @entity19 religion			1
@entity73 communities have a ' responsibility , ' he said , to explain that @entity30 and @entity183 draw ' selectively ' from @entity19 texts			1
' they do depend upon the misperception around the world that they speak in some fashion for people of the @entity73 faith , that @entity19 is somehow inherently violent , that there is some sort of clash of civilizations , ' @entity0 said			1
proceeding , he said , ' of course , the terrorists do not speak for over a billion @entity73 who reject their hateful ideology			0
they no more represent @entity19 than any madman who kills innocents in the name of @entity270 represents @entity107 or @entity271 or @entity272 or @entity273			0
' no religion is responsible for terrorism			0
people are responsible for violence and terrorism			0
and killing in the name of religion , is ' not unique to one group , or to one geography , or one period of time , ' the president said , echoing remarks he made a the @entity287 earlier this month			1
of @entity30 , he said : ' they are not religious leaders - they 're terrorists			2
' @entity0 rejected the notion that ' the @entity186 and @entity19 are in conflict ' and called on @entity73 leaders ' to do more to discredit the notion that our nations are determined to suppress @entity19			1
' ' everybody has to speak up very clearly that no matter what the grievance , violence against innocents does n't defend @entity19 or @entity73 , it damages @entity19 and @entity73 , ' he said			1
he encouraged ' older people ' in the audience to get with the times and learn how to use social media if they want to help prevent the spread of radicalism			0
' as wise and respected as you may be , your stuff is often boring compared to what they â€™re doing , ' he said			0
' you 're not connected			0
and as a consequence , you are not connecting			0
