lassie the dog nuzzled and licked able seaman @entity1 - who was presumed dead following an attack off @entity3 , @entity4 , in the @entity5 - until he stirred and was brought back to life the little - known tale of a dog named @entity9 who brought a sailor back to life by licking his face during the @entity5 has emerged 100 years later			1
the bodies of seven sailors had been laid out in the cellar of a port - side pub in @entity3 , @entity4 , following a @entity18 torpedo attack on a @entity20 battleship in the @entity21 on @entity22 , 1914			1
all were presumed dead until the landlord 's rough - haired collie dog entered the basement and sat alongside the motionless body of one sailor , able seaman @entity1			1
she proceeded to lick his face and nuzzle him for 30 minutes until , amazingly , he began to stir and rescuers rushed to his side			0
he went on to make a full recovery			0
the incredible act sounds like it could be a storyline straight from the 1950s tv series @entity9			2
some people even believe the @entity3 dog provided @entity37 author @entity36 with the inspiration to write his 1938 novel @entity39 , which paved the way for the subsequent tv show and film			1
however , @entity9 aficionados say there is no record of the writer being aware of the story			1
now the remarkable story has been revealed in full by the late historian @entity51 in his book , @entity4 in the @entity5 , which has been published posthumously			1
a total of 547 men perished when the battleship @entity56 came under attack from an enemy submarine during an exercise in @entity60			0
about 200 men , including @entity62 , survived the blasts from the torpedoes			0
two lifeboats were lowered into the water before a loss of power prevented any more being used			0
while the ship was sinking , the chaplain , the @entity69 , went below the decks to fetch cigarettes for the men , only to end up drowning			0
the following day one lifeboat washed up on the beach at @entity3 and those on board , who were barely alive , were taken to the nearby @entity79			2
landlord @entity80 turned his beer cellar into a makeshift mortuary and the dead , including @entity62 , were placed there before the bodies could be taken away by officials			2
his dog , a cross-bred collie , had become used to licking the face of mr @entity80 ' wife to rouse her from regular epileptic fits			1
she began to nuzzle the face and hands of @entity62 until he eventually stirred			2
after recovering from his ordeal , the sailor visited members of staff at the pub and @entity9 to thank them for saving his life			1
@entity101 , the director at the @entity102 , said : ' the formidable was torpedoed 20 miles off @entity104 in @entity105			0
the ship was hit at 2am on @entity107 and then again at 4.40am before it went down			0
' there was a crew of almost 800 and some of the survivors were recovered by a fishing boat out of @entity113			0
' about 40 men managed to get into a small lifeboat which spent 23 hours in the sea before it reached @entity3			0
seven of the men died on board from exposure			0
' a local policeman arranged for the survivors to go to the @entity122 inn about 50 metres away and they were given dry clothes , brandy and cigarettes			0
@entity9 was a cross-bred collie owned by the landlord of @entity128 ( above ) in @entity3 , @entity4 , where sailors were brought back after a torpedo attack off the coast in 1914			1
seaman @entity132 was presumed dead many people believe the tale of the @entity3 dog inspired @entity36 's 1938 novel @entity39 which paved the way for the subsequent tv show and 2005 film ( above )			1
however , others dismiss this idea ' the seven bodies were taken down into the cellar , including that of @entity1			0
' @entity9 would n't leave @entity132 's side and licked him and licked him until he started to show signs of life			1
' there are different theories as to where the inspiration for @entity9 came and ours is one of those			0
it is said that when people heard the story of @entity9 and what she did to rescue @entity132 , they told it again and again			2
' author @entity36 was born in @entity163 in 1897 and would have been aged 18 at the time of the sinking of @entity56			0
it means he could have been aware of the incident and potentially could have used the tale in his well - known novel			0
however , @entity170 , the @entity171 author of the 1993 book @entity173 maintains it was the heartbreak of @entity36 witnessing families sell their prized collies to buy food during the depression of the 1930s that inspired him			2
he said : ' @entity36 was inspired by a depression - era tour of @entity37 where he saw things that were so bad people were selling their prized dogs just to raise money to feed their families			1
' his own collie , @entity189 , served as the model for @entity9 in the @entity192 short story that was later expanded into a novel			1
' i spoke with his daughter when i did the research and reviewed all of @entity36 's interviews on the inspiration			1
' none of my looks through @entity36 's notes on the story and later the book is anything mentioned about the @entity9 story from @entity3			1
' but who knows , maybe , while growing up in @entity37 , @entity36 heard that story			2

landlord 's dog nuzzled face of sailor until he stirred and could be saved
@entity215 was presumed dead in @entity3 during @entity5 attack
tale of cross-bred collie - @entity9 - has now come to light 100 years later
many believe story inspired @entity36 's 1938 novel @entity39
