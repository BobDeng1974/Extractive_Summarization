by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:56 est , 26 february 2014 @entity3 : 10:49 est , 26 february 2014 after being photographed in @entity5 wearing stylish brogues and sending her own models down the catwalk in flats during @entity11 , it seems @entity12 is hot - footing a new trend			1
designers in @entity15 have taken notice of @entity12 's style with @entity18 showcasing models in a variety of flat shoes at their @entity23 show			1
meanwhile @entity24 and @entity25 's have also offered flats as the answer to summer shoe style			1
flat fashion : @entity12 , known for her penchant for sky scraper heels , has been shunning her favourite footwear in favour of flats lately @entity25 championed flats at his @entity37 show , opting for classic black velvet with the occasional jolt of silver			1
@entity41 offered more androgynous flats , sending models down the catwalk in monochrome brogues toughened up with gold buckles and fringing			2
@entity12 , 39 , once said she ' could n't concentrate in flats ' and ' beyond hated ' ballet shoes but has had to learn to love them after being told to ditch the heels in 2011			1
she suffered a slipped disc following the birth of daughter @entity54 and was under doctor 's orders to wear comfortable shoes			0
since then , other celebrities have been ditching the heels including @entity59 and @entity60 who opted to wear sensible flats at the @entity62 show this season			1
low heights : models took to the runway at the @entity25 show , left , and @entity41 , right , in - shock horror - flats ! socialite poppy adorned her feet with a now sold - out pair of heart - print calf - hair slippers from @entity74 , which retail at £ 350			1
the shoes have a mirrored gold heel and a red satin insole			0
meanwhile , it - girl @entity60 , 27 , stuck to a black @entity79 - inspired pair of slippers which were covered in jewels			2
always one to be ahead of the trend , @entity82 , who has long championed flats , was spotted out and about over @entity11 in comfortable footwear			1
the presenter has , however , swapped her much - loved ballet pumps for more on - trend @entity89 trainers			0
@entity90 : @entity59 , left , and @entity60 , centre , both wore slipper shoes to the @entity62 fashion show held at the @entity95 on tuesday but can flat shoes ever be as stylish or flattering as heels ? speaking about the new trend , @entity99 , celebrity stylist and @entity102 shoes @entity100 , said : ' i for one am so pleased to see that flat shoes are taking centre stage at all the runway shows in @entity15			1
' i love the wedge soled punk-esque wedge flats at @entity41 and t - bar flats at @entity18			1
' i ’m not surprised this trend is becoming so big , it ’s been creeping in for a few past seasons now : brogues have been big news for a while , so has the loafer having its own style revival this summer			2
' @entity117 's kitten flats have been seen on every celebrity from @entity119 to @entity120			0
@entity82 is a trailblazer for flats choosing to ditch high heels and wear the look for formal events			2
queen of flats : @entity82 has long championed flat shoes - even wearing them to smart events ' the high street have some great flat styles out there right now , my favourite being the black suede loafers from @entity102			2
' finally we have a trend that makes sense , every woman wants to be comfortable and look stylish at the same time			0
with more women leading demanding lives , gone are the days running for the bus in a pair of towering @entity144 heels			0
' i think here has always been a bit of a taboo about how flats ca n't be flattering , but with the right trouser leg length or skirt length , this can actually be an incredibly flattering shoe and make anybodys legs look longer			0
' bring on the flats i say and the sooner the better			0
' urban chic : @entity155 has ditched her once favoured ballet pumps to embrace the sport 's luxe trend in the form of @entity89 trainers @entity162 , menswear writer at @entity163 , said : ' it is undeniable that there is an attraction to a women in heels			0
although i would say that this is often radiated by their own self confidence , which comes with wearing them			0
' flat shoes on a woman can also be attractive , especially in adapted traditionally masculine silhouettes , such as a brogue or penny loafer a la @entity82			2
' nude block heel ballerina , £ 19.00 , @entity179 , @entity180 , £ 30 , @entity181 hotter sorbet shoe , £ 75 , @entity183 , £ 24.99 , @entity184			0
