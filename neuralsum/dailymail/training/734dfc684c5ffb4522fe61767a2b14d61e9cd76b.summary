by @entity0 published : 10:44 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 11:14 est , 9 october 2013 despite having expensive , specialised forensics equipment and highly trained scientists and police , developed countries still struggle to solve some murders			1
in @entity7 , the job is even harder			1
corruption is rife , the war masks a lot of the violence – and there ’s only one forensics unit in the country			2
it ’s called the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) and writer @entity18 , under military escort , paid a visit to its headquarters in @entity22 and met the dedicated staff helping to bring law and order to a turbulent society			1
dedicated : the @entity17 's staff tackle around 300 new cases a month firearms taken for ballistics testing are stashed in racks , ranging from vintage rifles to assault weapons corruption : the unit 's director , @entity35 , admits that some people escape justice because of who they know one case the team there tell him about involved a headless body that had been left in the middle of a road			1
a note pinned to the chest read : ‘ anyone who attends this man ’s funeral can expect the same fate			2
’ in the end , plenty of people turned up to it , because the @entity17 ’s document - exploitation expert , @entity57 , with the help of a $ 98,000 machine that analyses handwriting , matched the writing on the note to a suspect that had been arrested			1
according to the director of forensics , @entity64 , another case is being hindered by corruption			2
he told @entity68 : ‘ i can show you one case			2
a female was killed by a government official			2
he denied it , of course , but through the fingerprint on the gun , we found that this person killed the female			0
we sent that information back to the court			0
’ however , the suspect is still free			0
col @entity35 added : ‘ he has power , so he is still playing around the country , still free			0
in this country , some of the criminals go to jail and some go free because of the people they know			0
’ col @entity35 admitted , though , that they are helped by the fact that only about 20 per cent of the country realises that fingerprints can help establish guilt			1
and the director himself did n’t even know what @entity97 was until four years ago			1
the ctd was established in 2003 by @entity99 and its 102 technicians tackle 300 new cases a month			1
they desperately need more equipment			0
one technician told @entity68 that they need about 10 bullet - matching machines , but only have one that was a present from @entity107 – and it was 30 years old when it arrived			1
tech : the ctd 's equipment , although old , has still helped to solve some murders most afghans do n't know that fingerprints can identify them identifying counterfeit currency , such as this fake $ 100 bill , is also part of the unit 's role there have been several incidents of @entity7 turning on @entity99 troops in recent years , but @entity68 explained that the technicians at @entity17 are highly trusted , as evidenced by the fact that his @entity99 bodyguards took off all their armour once inside the building			1
@entity128 senior advisor @entity127 told him : ‘ these are good guys who care about what they do			0
i mean , they actually show up for work every day , which in this country is n’t always the case			0
