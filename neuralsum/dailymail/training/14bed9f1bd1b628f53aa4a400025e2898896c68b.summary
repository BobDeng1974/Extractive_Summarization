political duo , @entity0 and @entity1 teamed up on stage at the @entity3 yesterday			1
the smartly - dressed mother - daughter hosted a ticketed forum on illegal wildlife trafficking , calling for a return to the stricter anti-poaching rules of the @entity9			1
later in the day , former secretary of state , @entity0 also took the opportunity to endorse president @entity13 's call for military strikes against @entity14			1
@entity15 : @entity16 joined her mother @entity0 at the @entity3 last night to engage support for their newly renamed family foundation according to the @entity20 she said ' it would be an important step ' if @entity14 president @entity23 surrendered his stockpile of chemical weapons			1
' the @entity23 regime â€™s inhuman use of weapons of mass destruction against innocent men , women and children violates a universal norm at the heart of our global order , and therefore it demands a strong response from the international community , led by the @entity39 , ' she continued			0
as a @entity39 senator in 2002 , @entity0 endorsed military action in @entity42 , a decision that came back to haunt her in her failed @entity3 campaign six years later			1
subject close to their hearts : the smartly - dressed , mother - daughter duo hosted a ticketed forum on illegal wildlife trafficking , smiling as they left the stage well done : during her speech , @entity16 called for a return to stricter anti-poaching rules now , the 65 - year - old potential 2016 presidential candidate is risking the possibility of a similar political situation in a future campaign with her support of president @entity13 's call for a @entity39 - led military strike in @entity14 as punishment for the use of chemical weapons			1
the two conflicts are different : @entity42 was a full - fledged war with ground troops that lasted nearly nine years , while the @entity13 administration is talking about a limited , focused air attack in @entity14			1
even so , opponents could use @entity15 's position against her in a future campaign			0
' the world will have to deal with this threat as swiftly and comprehensively as possible , ' @entity15 said monday in her first public endorsement of @entity13 's plan to respond to @entity14 's chemical weapons use			1
making her mark : @entity16 , 33 , acts as vice president for her family 's non-profit foundation , recently renamed to include all three @entity86 in the name special bond : @entity16 is the only child of former @entity39 president @entity90 and former secretary of state , @entity0 lost in thought : later in the day @entity0 took the opportunity to endorse president @entity13 's call for military strikes against @entity14 she welcomed suggestions that the @entity23 regime may surrender its stockpile of chemical weapons , but echoed warnings from the @entity13 administration that ' this can not be another excuse for delay and obstruction			1
' she 's expected to repeat her stance in a speech tuesday , despite widespread @entity39 and congressional opposition to military intervention			2
an @entity110 poll released monday found that most @entity39 oppose even a limited attack - likely with cruise missiles - and about half are fearful that a strike would lead to a long - term @entity39 military commitment in @entity14			1
as she did with the @entity42 vote nearly a dozen years ago , @entity15 is betting she will be on the right side of history by standing with @entity13 despite the public opinion polls and a divided @entity120			2
political crowd : @entity122 , secretary of the interior , sits next to @entity16 in the audience it was similar to the gamble she made in 2002 when she voted to give president @entity127 the authorization to use force in @entity42			2
the resolution passed the @entity131 , and public opinion was more supportive of war			0
by the time the 2008 presidential primary campaign came around , support for the war had soured			0
@entity13 , who had spoken out in opposition to the war as an @entity140 state senator , won the @entity142 nomination over @entity15 in part by playing up the differences in their positions on the @entity42 war			2
@entity15 's supporters say this time is different , and they argue that she will be rewarded politically for sticking by the president			2
@entity15 's support was not exactly a surprise			0
as the nation 's top diplomat , she supported intervening in @entity14 with a proposal in the summer of 2012 to arm vetted units of the @entity14 rebels			2
pricey affair : apparently after giving their speeches on monday evening the @entity86 held a cocktail reception at the @entity161 embassy , with tickets costing $ 1,000 a person the @entity3 later turned down those plans			0
@entity15 also pushed attempts in the @entity166 to develop a political transition in @entity14 and provide humanitarian aid to @entity14			0
the @entity169 , set up after the 42nd president left the @entity3 , was renamed a few weeks ago to include all three @entity86 in the name			0
@entity1 , 33 , has become vastly more engaged in running operations over recent years , taking on the role as vice chair			0
the @entity175 reported this summer that the family are now trying to raise a $ 250million endowment according to the @entity20 after giving their speeches on monday evening the @entity86 held a cocktail reception at the @entity161 embassy , with tickets costing $ 1,000 a person			0
later they hosted a dinner at their home on @entity183 for $ 25,00 per couple .			0
