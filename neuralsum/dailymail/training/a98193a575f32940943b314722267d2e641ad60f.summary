‘ i have no doubt the tournament will give us the opportunity to show the quality of our facilities			0
‘ i would also like to congratulate all those involved in bringing the tournament to @entity0 , i have never had the opportunity to play in a home - based tournament so the experience for our @entity30 squad should be extra special and i hope that the lads seize the opportunity before them			1
’ reflecting on his experience of playing in the tournament in 2002 , just two years before he announced himself as a global star at @entity68 , @entity44 added : ‘ playing for @entity0 in the @entity30 finals in 2002 was , at the time , the proudest moment of my life			1
@entity0 senior captain @entity44 was voted as @entity1 ’s golden player at the 2002 under 17 finals ‘ i quickly discovered playing tournament football is completely different to normal competitive matches			2
playing in @entity75 gave me great experience and a first taste of the atmosphere and conditions of playing for your country in the finals of a tournament			0
‘ from my point of view , i found the experience invaluable			0
i can still remember that feeling you get when things are going well as we progress throughout the tournament			0
‘ we eventually lost to @entity9 , the eventual winners , in the semi-final , but bounced back with a great team performance in the third and fourth place play - off game , beating @entity23 and i was fortunate enough to score a hat - trick			2
’ @entity44 , who made his full @entity0 debut the following year , added : ‘ looking back now i would say that a player experiencing tournament football as early as they can is a vital part of a player ’s development			1
‘ in my case i was able to use my experience of 2002 in the 2004 euros in @entity105 with the senior @entity0 side			2
’ the incentive is there for the @entity0 class of 2018 to emulate the fantastic achievements of @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and co , who lifted the trophy last year in @entity19			1

‘ we won the @entity30 finals in 2010 and 2014 , and reached the semi-finals in 2011 so hosting the final round for the first time makes sense			2
