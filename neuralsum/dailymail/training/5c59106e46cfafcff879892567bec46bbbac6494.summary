by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 1 april 2013 border guards battling the illegal trade in elephant tusks and rhino horns from @entity5 are making 600 seizures a year as gangsters try to smuggle ivory into the @entity9			2
although the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989 , customs officials are still seizing illegally imported ivory every week , including a 15kg haul discovered at @entity15			1
the freight was being smuggled from @entity17 to @entity18 and @entity19 , where there is a growing market for intricately carved ivory jewellery and decorations			1
seizure : @entity25 of the @entity26 says his team seize 600 illegal shipments of elephant tusks and rhino horns every year as a result the price of ivory has reached an incredible £ 2,000 per kilo			1
when officials looked inside the shipment , labelled as ' handicraft samples ' , during a check on suspicious - looking crates , they discovered several hundred carved items , including bracelets and beads hidden inside			1
an investigation by the @entity45 newspaper revealed how @entity47 investigators are still facing a battle against ivory poachers , many of whom are supported by terrorist organisations			2
senior border force officer @entity25 told the newspaper that his team were currently making around 600 seizures a year - most of which was ivory			2
caught : a man had tried to smuggle this rhino horn , taken from a dead animal at @entity58 in @entity59 , out of the @entity60 to @entity18 where is is powdered and used in traditional medicine prized : powdered rhino horn can reach prices of £ 50,000 a kilo - making it more valuable than gold or cocaine ' there is no doubt about it that these are terrorist organisations who are slaughtering the animals to fund their activities , whether it be human trafficking or other things , ' he said			1
as many as 50,000 elephants were slaughtered for their ivory in 2011 , the highest figure in 23 years			2
only two weeks ago 50 poachers on horseback , carrying rifles and machetes , brutally killed 89 @entity83 elephants including 33 pregnant females and 15 calves - leading to fears that there could be a further increase in smuggling cases			0
the poachers attacked the herd in the @entity83 country of @entity93 , with officials sadly confirming that the animal 's tusks had been hacked off before they were killed			0
under threat : as many as 50,000 elephants were slaughtered for their ivory in 2011 , the highest figure in 23 years ( file picture ) last year poachers killed 650 elephants at the @entity102 in @entity103 , butchering the surviving animals when they returned to mourn their dead			0
when the sought - after ivory reaches @entity18 , where the domestic market is still legal , it is quickly purchased by buyers keen to exhibit their wealth			1
even museums and zoos in the @entity60 have become fearful that poachers could strike because the trade in ivory and rhino horn , which is used in traditional @entity116 medicines and is prized as an aphrodisiac , is so lucrative			1
poaching gangs have been turning to @entity119 in their attempts to get the horns as rhinos in the wild have been hunted to the brink of extinction , with just 29,000 remaining			0
valued : @entity126 is smuggled from @entity5 to @entity18 and @entity19 where there is a growing market for intricately carved ivory jewellery and decorations ( file picture ) the powdered horn can reach prices of £ 50,000 a kilo - making it more valuable than gold or cocaine			1
at @entity137 in @entity138 and @entity139 , near @entity140 , @entity141 , volunteers have been recruited to help protect the centre 's 20 black rhinos by carrying out night patrols			0
park boss @entity145 said : ' the police are taking it seriously enough to visit us , so we ’ve got to take it seriously as well			0
' in 2010 a man was jailed for two months after he attempted to smuggle the horn from a dead rhino at @entity58 , @entity59 out of @entity153 to @entity18			1
and it is not just organised criminals who can fall foul of import laws , as mr @entity25 told how his specialised team often were forced to confiscate hunting books and boots made from elephant skin from tourists			0
other recent finds include skulls , tiger bear and wolf skins and coral - all among the 30,000 animal and plant species listed as @entity169			0
the team also discovered a rhino horn that would fetch £ 110,000 , which has been placed under lock and key at a secret location			2
demand for the prized horn has risen in @entity177 and @entity18 because it is wrongly seen as a miracle cure			1
the @entity179 has insisted that the @entity60 must continue to battle the illegal trade			0
' flimsy punishment does not deter poachers – often the same people involved in drugs and arms dealing , ' said director @entity186 .			0

@entity26 still seizes illegally imported ivory every week
15kg haul was discovered at @entity15 labelled as ' handicraft samples '
@entity126 prized in @entity18 where jewellery and decorations still *popular*
