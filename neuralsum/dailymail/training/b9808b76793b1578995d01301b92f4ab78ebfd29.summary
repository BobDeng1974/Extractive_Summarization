the freediving couple live for six months of the year on the tiny @entity129 island of @entity130 , and for the rest of the year they travel the world exploring new underwater areas			1
the pictures where @entity9 is barefoot and ' standing ' on the ocean 's rocky bottom were taken in cenotes near @entity139 in the @entity140 , in south east @entity122			2
' freediving ' @entity144 ' was a surreal and magical experience , the cathedral light dramatically pierced the cool dark waters and provided an ethereal backlight to the beckoning caves and caverns below , ' they said			0
the depth of these pits are often unknown due to the swirling white halocline that hovers at 30 metres , a chemical reaction between layers of fresh and salt water , through which the sunlight barely pierces and the dark depths lie beneath			2
the deepest cenote that they freedived was 75 metres in vertical depth called @entity161 , beneath the halocline they were freediving in pitch black with only glow sticks on their dive rope to guide them			2
' we only discovered the bottom of @entity161 at 75 metres when our feet touched the silty bottom			0
freediving @entity161 was a very eerie and dark experience ! ' inquisitive : while most divers remain a few feet from the surface , @entity9 and @entity173 can sink to the seabed and experience the joys of inquisitive wildlife the @entity180 wreck , off @entity122 's coast : being able to freedive to such depths gives a whole new element of fun and freedom when exploring shipwrecks together when they explored the @entity188 , also known as @entity192 c - 53 , located off the island of @entity180 off the @entity122 coast , they had fun with their pictures			1
the wreck lies on the sandy bottom of depths between 25 to 30 metres			0
the @entity192 was a @entity197 made admirable - class minesweeper built in 1944 for the @entity199 during @entity200 in 1962 the @entity188 was sold to the @entity199 and was retitled @entity201 ( @entity202 ) where it guarded the @entity204 and the @entity205 aiding search and rescue operations and watching for illegal arms and drug trafficking			0
it was sunk deliberately in 1999 for the purpose of recreational diving and as an artificial reef for marine life and corals			0
the incredible dolphin shots , as well as the inquisitive seal and tutrle were all taken while on a sailing and freediving trip to @entity221			1
mutual love : the couple travel the world together for six months of the year exploring new hidden worlds under the waves they were along the @entity228 of the island and woke early each morning to freedive with a pod of wild @entity231 who would return to the bay for play and rest after a night fishing in the deep oceans			1
the pod was over 60 strong and very curious			0
' the dolphins would approach and play with us for many hours during the morning of their own free will and could leave at anytime if they wish			0
' freediving with wild dolphins is exhilerating and enchanting , their intense curiosity and intelligence is captivating and their movement in the water skilful and elegant			2
