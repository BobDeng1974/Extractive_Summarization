by @entity0 technology to help aircraft detect volcanic ash is set to go into commercial production , with @entity6 planning to be the first airline to use it			2
effectively a weather radar for ash , the @entity9 system has been supported by @entity6 and should reduce the chances of a repeat of the @entity15 volcanic ash - cloud crisis of spring 2010			1
the crisis came following the eruption of @entity18 and led to days of grounded flights across @entity20 in april and may 2010			1
ahead of the pack : @entity6 will be the first carrier to use new ash detecting technology created by dr @entity24 of @entity25 , the system utilises infra - red technology fitted to aircraft to supply images to pilots and an airline 's operations control centre			2
the images will enable pilots to see an ash cloud up to 60 miles ahead of the aircraft and at altitudes between 5,000ft and 50,000ft , thus allowing them to make small adjustments to the plane 's flight path to avoid any ash cloud			1
the concept is very similar to weather radars which are standard on commercial airliners today			0
on the ground , information from aircraft with avoid technology would be used to build an accurate image of the volcanic ash cloud using real - time data			0
this could open up large areas of airspace that would otherwise be closed during a volcanic eruption , which would benefit passengers by minimising disruption			0
@entity15 ash cloud : the eruption of the @entity59 caused havoc for days across @entity20 the technology was tested by @entity20 planemaker @entity62 last november through a unique experiment which involved the creation of an artificial ash cloud			1
@entity6 's engineering director @entity66 said the @entity9 production deal , between @entity68 and avionics supplier @entity69 , was ' a tangible and significant step forward in bringing this technology from conception into reality '			0
he went on : ' @entity6 has supported the development of this innovative technology since the 2010 volcanic eruption which brought aviation to a halt in @entity20			2
we look forward to being the first airline to fit this technology on our aircraft			0

@entity85 - based airline is set to become the first to use new system
@entity88 will sport ash up to 60 miles away
@entity18 's eruption in @entity15 in 2010 *cancelled* flights across @entity20
