by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 24 november 2012 updated : 17:15 est , 24 november 2012 thousands of cancer patients are being denied access to better treatment because of a lack of trained doctors , according to an ‘ alarming ’ @entity7 report			1
one in four cancer patients who receive radiotherapy in hospitals would benefit from the latest techniques , but some hospitals do not offer the treatment or provide it for only 0.1 per cent of sufferers , officials say			1
intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment ( @entity18 ) is more accurate , has fewer side effects and avoids damage to healthy tissue , enabling patients to recover more quickly			1
one in four cancer patients who receive radiotherapy in hospitals would benefit from the latest techniques but a @entity26 report found that only four cancer centres out of 50 in @entity28 offer the treatment to all those who might benefit , because many specialists are not trained in how to administer it			1
the government has been forced to offer financial incentives to hospitals to provide more radiotherapy , which means they will now be paid per patient , to address the problem			1
on average , only six per cent of patients are being given access to @entity18 , which the report describes as ‘ unacceptably low ’			0
radiotherapy – using radiation to burn away cancer – is one of the disease ’s most effective treatments and is used to treat 100,000 people a year			2
the technique carries a risk of killing healthy cells as well as the tumour , but @entity18 allows the rays to be targeted at specific areas			0
a @entity55 spokeswoman described the report ’s findings as ‘ alarming ’ and said many patients may be suffering unnecessarily and for longer because they are not given access to the technique			0
she said : ‘ we ’re extremely concerned by the shortfall in advanced radiotherapy			0
‘ if patients are n’t being offered techniques like @entity18 when this would be the most appropriate treatment , they could be experiencing side effects they might have otherwise been spared			1
huge improvements are needed if we are to ensure that the right patients are getting the right sort of radiotherapy			2
’ @entity75 president @entity74 accepted that not enough patients – just 16,000 each year – are receiving @entity18 , and many were being denied the highest possible standards of treatment			2
she said : ‘ the report shows we still need more radiographers and physicists trained in the new techniques such as @entity18 which could benefit 24 per cent of those who undergo radiotherapy			1
‘ uptake is so slow because we have a workforce working very hard to deliver treatment on a day - to - day basis , but we need to give people time to get out of the workplace to train			0
’ to perform @entity18 , doctors must complete a training course over several days and then be mentored when they return to hospital			0
hospitals do not need any additional equipment			0
the report also highlights that 26 out of 265 radiotherapy machines in @entity28 are past their use - by date , and a further 59 will need replacing in the next three years			1
this will cost the @entity102 an estimated £ 100 million			0
a further 147 machines are needed to cope with expected demand by 2016 as cancer becomes more common in an ageing population , at a cost of up to £ 200 million			0
the report estimates that the amount of radiotherapy provided to patients will need to rise by 67 per cent in the next four years .			2

one in four cancer patients who receive radiotherapy in hospitals would benefit from the latest techniques
but only four cancer centres out of 50 in @entity28 are currently offering the treatment
