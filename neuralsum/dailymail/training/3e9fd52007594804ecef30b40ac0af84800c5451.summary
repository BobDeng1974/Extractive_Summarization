they were feather - light yet anchored faster than @entity2 in a storm			0
with their vivid shades and contrasting colours they were often the most captivating aspect of their wearer ’s outfit — without ever overshadowing the royal head atop which they sat. little wonder , then , that the hats of @entity13 have graced the heads of three generations of royal women : the @entity18 , princess @entity19 and the @entity20			1
the milliner , who died this week after a long career , was loved and trusted by the @entity18 — as well as countless celebrities , from @entity24 to @entity25 — for his ability to make appropriate yet fashion - forward headwear			1
but it is his prodigious work for the @entity18 , for whom he created 40 or 50 hats a year , for which he will be best remembered			1
crucially , he had her complete confidence , which meant she trusted his judgment and was willing to explore different shapes and colours			0
veiled in a pale blue hairband during a 1990 visit to @entity56 ( left ) and this half - turban , half - hat ( right ) caused a stir in @entity60 in 1989 a soft ‘ @entity68 - style ’ hat to match an @entity63 coat in 1989 ( left ) and a yellow silk - laced brim ( right ) to accompany the @entity66 to @entity67 in 1991 his hats , while elegant and deceptively simple , moved royal style away from the small , back - of - crown affairs favoured by the @entity66 and the young @entity18 to something much more striking and substantial			2
the son of a cobbler from @entity77 , @entity74 would visit the @entity18 at @entity78 for fittings , after being sent swathes of fabric and dress designs from which to work up matching headpieces			1
he was far from intimidated by the experience			0
‘ often i ’ve put something on her majesty ’s head and said : “ oops , i do n’t like that , that ’s not right , ” ’ he once said			0
‘ i do n’t think she ’s used to that			0
’ @entity13 creates interesting shapes and textures with his hats but admits that sometimes they do n't quite work after agreeing the style , colour and fabric , he would then create the hat by hand on a wooden block and return to fit it again in person			2
@entity74 had a similar impact on @entity19 , encouraging her towards bigger brimmed , bright hats with contrasting bands , from under which her heavily made - up eyes would peer out			1
he explained that she could get away with such huge headwear because of her statuesque figure			0
as he put it : ‘ you could still see her underneath			0
’ and his love of modern design meant that well into retirement age he was still making hats that looked up - to - date on @entity20 , 50 years his junior			2
opposite are his glorious creations as worn by the @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
