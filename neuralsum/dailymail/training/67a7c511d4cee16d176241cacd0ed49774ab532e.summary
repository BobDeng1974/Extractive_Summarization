@entity7 ’s mum cheered him on yesterday as he thrashed her favourite tennis pin - up @entity9			1
how @entity10 must have steeled herself for this moment			0
on one hand , a mother ’s pride at her champion in the making ; on the other , the end of a beautiful @entity19 relationship with the hunkiest player on the circuit			0
victory : @entity7 is victorious after defeating @entity9 and now faces @entity23 in the semi-final straight sets : @entity7 cruised past @entity9 of @entity26 in their quarter - final ' my mum fancies you ' : @entity7 offers some words of consolation to his vanquished opponent what enormous reserves of restraint she must have called upon not to blow @entity9 a goodbye kiss or give him a wolf - whistle			1
but after all their mock flirting over the internet , you might at least have expected the defeated @entity44 to send her an affectionate tweet			0
for 50 - year - old divorcee mrs @entity49 , whose public infatuation with @entity9 threatened at one stage to take on @entity52 proportions , the dream must end			1
but 24 - year - old @entity7 ’s dream of winning @entity54 might soon be on the way to fruition on the strength of his performance yesterday			1
he and 29 - year - old @entity9 faced each other like gladiators on @entity60 as mrs m looked down from a seat in the players ’ box alongside her son ’s girlfriend @entity65			1
@entity7 had failed once again to shave off his straggly facial hair			2
steady now @entity10 , but it seemed his hunky opponent had recently waxed his chest			0
onwards : @entity7 punches the air after securing victory and now hopes to go one better than last year 's title tilt cheered on : @entity7 delighted his fans by moving into he semi-finals - a point beyond which he is yet to progress at the @entity77 both players had both spent the morning practising in public			1
@entity7 had his family there ; @entity9 , who somehow managed to make pouring a bottle of water over his head look sexy – was watched by a cluster of 20 - something females among the crowd			1
they cooed and purred at every movement of the bronzed body mrs @entity49 had described 24 hours earlier as ‘ like a @entity93 god ’			0
we asked him if he would he blow a kiss towards mrs @entity49			0
‘ do you really think this is the right time to ask these questions , man ? ’ he replied , clearly in no mood to join @entity10 ’s fun			0
on @entity60 , however , the crowd quickly picked up on the tongue - in - cheek theme that mrs @entity104 has kept alive through schoolgirlish tweets about @entity9 and racy remarks in interviews			1
‘ come on @entity9 , ’ an @entity110 accent shouted			2
‘ do it for @entity10 ! ’ mrs @entity49 smiled			0
@entity65 , not so much			0
@entity7 , not at all			2
ladies day : @entity7 's mother @entity10 applauds her son 's victory from the stands accompanied by @entity65 in the sunshine : thousands of fans gathered on @entity7 's mound to watch the match this is the third time in a row the @entity122 has qualified for the semi-finals			1
asked at his post-match press conference about the continuing flirtation between his mother and his vanquished opponent , @entity7 grimaced			2
‘ i have n’t spoken to her about it but i was embarrassed by it , ’ he groaned			0
for @entity9 , it will have to be some other mañana			2
and – until next time at least – adios from @entity10			0
also bidding a dejected farewell to @entity54 was @entity135 , who cruised to a two - set lead before @entity138 @entity137 launched an astonishing comeback to win in five and earn a semi-final clash with @entity141			2
this was the @entity145 master ’s worst result here since he took over from @entity146 as the @entity147			0
@entity148 is dead ... long live @entity149 ? the lady in red : @entity152 and @entity153 were among the spectators to see a regal performance from @entity7 's best of luck : @entity158 driver @entity157 and his brother @entity159 , left , talk to @entity49 prior to her son 's match on centre court a kiss or @entity65 : @entity7 's girlfriend gets a peck on the cheek from pop mogul @entity168 the @entity170 fourth seed was never threatened by the @entity171 who wilted under a relentless barrage of pinpoint groundstrokes and consistent serving			2
@entity7 served three successive aces to seal victory on his first match point and he will next play top seed @entity23 or @entity179 @entity178 as he continues his bid to become the first @entity170 men 's singles champion at @entity54 for 75 years			1
@entity7 took the match 6 - 3 6 - 4 6 - 4 with the comfort of three match points to seal victory in the final game			1
@entity7 said : ' i thought it was good			2
i think @entity9 was a little bit tired but i served well for most of the match			2
i 'm sure in the next round i 'm going to get pushed even harder so i 'll have to raise my game even more			0
' seize the day : @entity7 of @entity192 reacts to a play during his quarterfinal round match against @entity9 the @entity170 no 1 had begun his previous match against @entity197 rather slowly but he quickly showed he would not make the same mistake again , piling the pressure on @entity9			1
the @entity44 is unseeded but a talented player on grass and making his third appearance in the quarter - finals			0
he had been hugely impressive in a straight - sets win over @entity205 in round three but few were predicting another upset here			1
@entity7 looked totally focused and a superb passing shot brought up another break point in the third game of the second set but @entity9 , who has served more aces in the tournament than anyone else , quickly shut the door			1
the @entity44 was bound to be feeling the effects of a lengthy five - setter against @entity219 in round four , where he had fought back from two sets down , and his right thigh was heavily taped up			2
@entity9 's stated belief that he could beat @entity149 for the first time in five meetings had to be called into question by his decision not to pull out of his mixed doubles match on monday , and he was simply not playing at anywhere near the @entity122 's pace			1
a forehand volley dumped into the net gave the world number four a break for 3 - 2 , and from there he was utterly untroubled , clinching the set 6 - 4 courtesy of yet another unforced error from @entity9			1
@entity7 had lost only eight points on his serve in the first two sets , and never more than two in a single game , but there were just signs at the start of the third that things might be changing			1
@entity9 took the @entity122 to deuce for the first time in game three , finally stringing a series of good shots together , but his revival was quickly curtailed by another @entity7 break			1
it needed the 24 - year - old to be at his best , with a forehand winner down the line followed by a stunning pass on the run			0
up next : @entity7 now faces @entity23 , who beat @entity179 @entity178 @entity7 was nearly there , and he held to make it 4 - 2 without too many problems , but he began to grimace and struggle a little with his movement			1
the @entity122 did not call the trainer but in the eighth game he found himself facing his first break points of the match			2
@entity9 , though , could not take advantage , and three successive aces helped @entity7 wrap up a simple victory			1
now , with @entity135 out of the running for the final , @entity7 fans can finally allow themselves a glimmer of hope that maybe this is the year @entity7 could win @entity54			2
with confidence behind @entity7 growing , ticket sales sites have reported that the price of tickets is soaring			0
according to one seller , ardent @entity7 fans could be willing to pay up to £ 20,000 a ticket to watch him if he gets to the @entity54 final			0
tickets for the men 's final are trading for up £ 10,000 on one website			0
@entity286 , director of viagogo @entity170 , said : ' tickets to see @entity7 are really driving sales - every time he wins , ticket prices for the men 's semi-finals and final jump by around 30 per cent as the nation 's hopes are raised			1
' tickets for the men 's final are currently trading at £ 10,000			0
if he keeps winning , i expect some seats will go for twice this level if not more			0
' this time last year tickets were trading at £ 6,000 when @entity7 was still in the championships			0
among the crowd showing their support for @entity7 were a sea of familiar faces			1
@entity152 , wearing a red dress from high street store @entity310 ' line @entity311 , watched with parents @entity314 and @entity316 and boyfriend @entity153 , from whom it was recently rumoured she had separated			0
@entity158 driver @entity157 greeted @entity7 's mother @entity10 , who was at the centre of attention after admitting to having a crush on @entity7 's rival @entity9			1
@entity179 @entity325 editor @entity324 put in an appearance , after cheering on her friend @entity135 .			0

@entity7 glides past @entity9 in straight sets : 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4
