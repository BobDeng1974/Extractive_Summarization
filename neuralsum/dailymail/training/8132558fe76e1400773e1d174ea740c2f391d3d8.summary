by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 05:56 est , 18 september 2013 decades before mobile phones and a world away from @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 thought it was farewell when they were released from their @entity9 prison			1
after being shot down on separate missions - and parachuting onto enemy soil - the pair met in the barbed - wire cells of @entity14 , a prisoners of war camp , in 1944			1
both aspiring artists , they became inseparable , sitting together and drawing as a way to cope with life as hostages in their icy @entity22 jail			1
but when liberation came , life had to go on , so @entity25 - born @entity24 , 23 , and 21 - year - old @entity5 from @entity26 were forced to part ways			1
neither could have imagined , as they were awarded parachute tie pins and bade each other a terse , but emotional farewell , that an accidental meeting would bring them back together - leading to 70 years of friendship			2
still together : artists @entity35 , left , and @entity36 , right , were reunited by chance in @entity26 veteran : @entity36 looking through the window of the @entity40 he parachuted out of years later , the startled pair were reunited in the comfortable confines of the office café at @entity45 advertisers in @entity26 - a step up from their usual backdrop			1
' i was working at @entity45 advertisers in @entity26 , ' mr @entity5 , now 91 , explained			1
' someone pointed at my tie pin and said " there 's someone else with one of those that works here "			2
' @entity59 to meet another parachuter , he followed his colleague along - only to find his friend and fellow inmate proudly wearing his own medal			0
the caterpillar was given to anyone who had been forced to parachute from their aircraft			0
prisoners of war : @entity5 , left , and @entity24 , right , stuck together in the camp			1
the would draw their experiences bleak : the sight of @entity75 guards in the harsh @entity22 climate outside @entity78 prison camp past : mr @entity5 sketched out his memory of soaring over enemy lines , picking targets and places to land mr @entity4 , a tail gunner who flew with @entity84 , bailed out of his @entity86 aircraft twice - his second landing him clean into @entity9 handcuffs			1
despite being dubbed ‘ golden balls ’ by colleagues for always escaping in the nick of time , his luck ran out on december 3 , 1942 when his plane was shot down from 15,000ft			0
it was the bravery of its young pilot , who died in the crash , that led to his survival			0
tough : the prisoners of war were forced to plough through the snow beneath gun - manned towers light - hearted : prisoners made light of their horrific situation			2
mr @entity5 's captions make fun of crash landings standards : the soldiers were expected to maintain decorum and style throughout the terrifying war ' i remember going up to the front and he turned round to me and said " get out - and that ’s an order			1
go ! " , ' explains @entity24 , who escaped the doomed plane only to parachute directly into the square of a @entity75 barracks			0
meanwhile @entity26 - born mr @entity5 , who flew with the @entity122 @entity121 , was on his penultimate sortie before being eligible for six months ’ leave when he was taken prisoner			1
' we ’d been bending some railway lines at @entity128 in northern @entity129 , ' he explains of the events of april 20 1944			0
' we succeeded in blowing up an ammunition train and then set course for home when were pounced on by a @entity134 , and it started a fire in the fuselage			0
' both men eventually ended up in @entity14 in what is now @entity22 - the @entity75 ’s northern-most pow camp , where they lived in adjoining huts			1
desperate to protect their highest ranking hostages , the @entity142 allowed the pair to take it easy			0
' as aircrew we were n’t allowed to work , we were too valuable , ' mr @entity4 explained			2
' that ’s how i met @entity5 , we used to draw			2
the camp : a compound surrounded by barbed wire at @entity14 in what is now defined as @entity22 life at war : mr @entity5 depicts being faced with the barrell of a gun , left , or ' watching the third reich ' , right marching : the prisoners of war were worked hard as they wondered whether they would make it out alive ' the @entity162 issued us with a big diary , and so we used to go round to each other , i ’d go to @entity5 and he ’d put something in it , and i ’d put something in his			1
' the two professional artists still reminisce about their time in captivity - documented by a series of sketches @entity5 hid from their @entity75 guards			1
' @entity174 did you get this bread ? ' , reads the caption on one picture of a @entity9 confronting a squaddie			0
another shows an airman ' watching the @entity9 ' from his plane , while others shows a camp commandant wielding a pistol or marching towards the camp gates			2
the pair laugh as mr @entity5 explains another popular pass - time : winding up their camp guards whenever possible			1
' @entity174 did you get dis bread ? ' : mr @entity5 mocks the portly @entity9 guard confronting an innocent squaddie he said : ' we made a great effort for them not to see us depressed			2
we were always laughing about something or another			0
' as a term of punishment - someone had done something , tried to escape or something like that - they ’d say " we ’ll close the theatre for a week "			0
' and instead of everyone groaning , there was a big cheer and clapping			0
" we ’ll close it for two weeks "			0
and there was more clapping and laughing			0
' in the end they could n’t beat us			0
' when the camp was finally liberated , both mr @entity4 and mr @entity5 returned to @entity213 , ending up in the same city and the same company , raising families and becoming professional artists			1
still working together , their drawings have been exhibited across @entity220 and beyond .			0

@entity5 , 21 , and @entity4 , 23 , were held hostage in @entity14 prisoner of war camp after parachuting onto enemy soil
they became inseparable drawing sketches of life in *capitivity*
