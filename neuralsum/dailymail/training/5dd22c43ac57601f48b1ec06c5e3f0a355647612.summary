a cyclist has launched a one - man campaign to shame dangerous drivers â€“ and fellow riders - by posting video footage of reckless manoeuvres			1
the 24 - year - old - who wishes to remain anonymous - uses a @entity8 headcam to film drivers in @entity10 stopping in cycle lanes , making risky u-turns and turning without checking mirrors			1
a careless cyclist is also shown trying to squeeze past a bus in one video			1
he has vowed to continue his crusade until the behaviour of motorists improves towards cyclists			0
' it was a case of recording for my own safety and protection			0
but i starting putting them online as an educational tool , ' said the anonymous cyclist			2
' i get a lot of drivers on mobile phones but police struggle to take action if it is n't their footage - they usually just talk to drivers to warn them			2
' a bus pulling in to a bus stop narrowly avoids hitting the cyclist , who posts videos of dangerous driving a driver takes a rest at the wheel while his car is parked in a cycle lane on the edge of a junction a car suddenly turns left without indicating and narrowly avoids hitting the cyclist who is close behind ' the police have seen my videos and they have spoken to some drivers and considered taking action so i get quite a lot of abuse			1
' i do n't want to be vulnerable if people recognise me on my way to work for my own safety			0
' but he also gets positive feedback			0
' drivers who were abusive on the roadside when incidents have happened then view the footage and get in touch to say they are now seeing it from a whole new perspective and are genuinely apologetic			2
' on those occasions , i take down the video because it 's done its job and the drivers seem genuinely aware that what they did was wrong			0
' if i get just one driver to change their ways - and potentially save a cyclist or pedestrian from harm - then what i 'm doing is worth it			2
' a silver car appears to be turning right at a busy junction in @entity96 but the driver does not seem to see the cyclist and makes a dangerous u-turn in the middle of the street the cyclist stops behind the silver car to watch the driver head off in the direction it had just come from he began filming around five years ago after being hit by a driver			1
as there were no independent witnesses , no action could be taken			0
' if i 'm in danger or if i had to take some form of action to prevent myself or others being harmed i upload it , ' he said			0
he thinks @entity10 's main challenges are driver awareness - and infrastructure maintenance			1
he added : ' i think the main thing is cycle infrastructure being maintained			0
quite often cycle pathways are installed but not maintained , they are n't cleaned well enough - there is glass and obstacles which makes it unsafe			0
' @entity127 has segregated cycle lanes and that 's definitely the way forward to encourage more people to cycle			1
' a driver turns right withot looking to check for cyclists and almost knocks the rider over a pedestrian in @entity10 is shown walking between traffic without checking to look for bikes			1
