@entity0 hit @entity1 has introduced a new cast member this season , after quietly firing original cast member @entity4 at the end of @entity7			1
@entity8 is introduced in @entity9 , which began airing last week , as an old friend of @entity19 ’s who has moved back to @entity12 in the wake of her divorce from an unnamed @entity16 man who she lived with in @entity18			1
and @entity20 can reveal that not only is her ex-husband @entity21 also the ex-husband of clueless actress @entity24 , he was also once the star of a reality show			1
@entity8 , 33 , was born @entity27 in @entity28			1
after going to the @entity29 ( during which time she met @entity1 castmate @entity30 ) she moved to @entity31 , @entity32 to ski and met @entity21 when she was 24			1
’ after they met , they got married in @entity12 and then she moved with him to @entity18			2
she never names him on the show or on the @entity0 website , but she shared a few photos on the series ' second episode the pair were together for seven years , she told @entity1 cameras , while photos showed snippets of their glamorous time together			1
but she said it was also terribly lonely , so lonely that she left him and @entity58 behind			0
‘ i was living the dream			0
we had a house in the [ @entity62 ] hills , swimming pool , staff , the cars , the jewels			0
when i moved out of the house i pretty much just walked away from all of it …			0
' on the inside i was so alone , so i packed up and left			0
sometimes you just have to save yourself , ' she told the camera as she choked back tears			0
no more bling : ‘ i was living the dream			0
we had a house in the @entity81 , swimming pool , staff , the cars , the jewels , ' @entity8 said on @entity1			1
she shared this photo of an impressive looking engagement ring , right @entity21 's first wife @entity24 , seen left in 1995 's @entity87 , had a sizable looking diamond ring herself in 2005 , at right , which was around the time she married to @entity21 after giving birth to their daughter @entity21 , 43 , is an @entity95 who claims to speak five languages and was married to @entity24 from 2005 to 2006			1
the pair share a daughter @entity98 , 11 , together			2
he is the ceo of @entity99 , an international firm which does sport branding and billboards and travels a lot for his job			0
from @entity8 ’s bio on the @entity0 website it would seem there is n't a lot of love lost between the pair , as she branded him in part an ' international man of not much mystery			1
' an excerpt reads : ‘ during this time she met a self - proclaimed ‘ @entity40			2
’ the international man of not much mystery swept her off her feet and they married in @entity12			2
the demands of their careers compounded with the duties for his actress ex-wife and young daughter became too much for the pair and they separated			2
’ the bio never names him or dash			0
but then she choked up while telling the cameras about her live with @entity21			2
despite the sunny @entity18 weather , @entity8 says her life was incredibly lonely @entity21 's life in @entity18 also includes daughter @entity98 , 11 , whom he had with ex-wife @entity24			1
one time @entity139 , who has been married three times , also has son @entity143 , 23 , pictured at right with his mom and sister after @entity8 and @entity21 pair split in 2013 , @entity8 spent the winter in @entity148 and arrived back in @entity12 to ‘ reclaim her life ’ in 2014 – coincidentally just in time to join the @entity0 show which filmed last summer			1
but @entity8 does n't just have friends on reality shows already			1
@entity19 , she has an ex-husband with plenty of experience himself , and she no doubt knew more than most what she would be getting into by joining the @entity0 hit			0
her ex-husband @entity21 was a repeat winner on the largely forgotten @entity16 reality show lost , which aired for just one season the fall of 2001			1
on lost two strangers were paired together , given almost no money and just three days ' rations , and were parachuted while blind folded into an unknown destination - including @entity166 and @entity167			2
all they knew was their final destination , and they had to find there way to it			0
@entity8 's ex @entity21 as seen on the opening credits , in 2001 , from the @entity16 reality show lost on the show @entity21 and his teammate , an until - the - show stranger named @entity177 , were dropped alongside two other teams in an unknown destination with little food or money			1
here they take their blindfolds off upon being left in @entity185 he worked his posh accent and knowledge of languages to his advantage			0
his team also had the benefit of his family apartment on @entity193 , where they stayed one night while passing through @entity195 with no money , seen right			0
that apartment was sold in 2004 , before he met @entity8 one episode saw @entity21 negotiating the price of his camel ride to @entity201 , seen here , before complaining that the saddle hurt his privates @entity21 was also rampant flirt and a charmer during his time on the show , smiling when the women here answered that he was he won multiple times , and celebrated each time with the classic champagne pop and crowd spray upon reaching @entity214 each race contained three teams , and each team had a cameraman in tow			1
on all but the season finale the teams were competing to be first back to @entity222 's @entity214			0
they had to beg and borrow and talk their way into freebies - including plane tickets - to survive			2
@entity21 , who skis and claims to speak five languages , thrived			2
the first team back to @entity214 won , and got to go on the adventure again			2
@entity21 won multiple rounds and featured prominently throughout the season			1
cameras followed as he and show partner @entity177 traversed on camel back to @entity201 , found his way out of @entity185 , and borrowed money off old school friends in @entity195 where his father conveniently had an apartment on @entity193			0
as a repeat winner he had a large amount of screen time , but he receded from the spotlight when the show went off the air			0
no doubt he would have good advice for his ex on how to win over viewers on reality television if the pair still speak			0
but it 's unclear if they are on speaking terms , and @entity21 appears to have bounced right back from his second divorce and into a new relationship			1
as of august 2013 his @entity257 status has been ‘ in a relationship ’ with @entity259 , 41 , a sometime actress and publicist for jewelry companies			0
@entity21 seems to have moved on from @entity8 with no problem			1
in august 2013 @entity259 proclaimed them ' in a relationship ' when she posted these two photos			0
