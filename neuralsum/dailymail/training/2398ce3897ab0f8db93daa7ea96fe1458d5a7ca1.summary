as a man not unaccustomed to the fortunes of national hunt racing , @entity0 well knows the wisdom of paying scant regard to the opening few furlongs of a chase			1
no bookmaker in the land will make good on a wager until the winning line has been breached			0
accordingly , the @entity14 manager believes those viewing monday ’s clash with @entity17 at @entity18 as some kind of title eliminator are n’t so much jumping the gun as calling the race before the protagonists are even in the stalls			1
@entity26 ’ team have managed just two wins from six thus far and currently sit seventh in the @entity28 – a long way from the form expected and certainly far removed from that which will cement an immediate return to the top - flight			1
@entity0 looks on during friday 's training session ahead of @entity14 ' clash with @entity17 on monday the @entity18 manager insists it is too early to write off @entity17 , even though they have struggled this season yet , even if defeat on monday were to widen the gap between them and @entity14 to 10 points after just seven matches , @entity0 feels the @entity45 side would still remain part of a chasing pack eminently capable of making up the ground over the course of 36 matches			1
‘ no matter how the game goes on monday , there is far too long to go in the @entity28 to start ruling anyone out at this stage , ’ the @entity14 boss insisted			1
‘ we ’ve seen how difficult it has been and is going to be			0
with 15 minutes to go at @entity58 , we would have taken a point all day to get out of there			0
i know @entity62 had chances at @entity64 , but @entity64 had a couple of their own , too			0
‘ there are @entity69 derbies to play , we ’ve got to go through to @entity70 and @entity45 — there ’s a massive , massive distance to go			0
’ nonetheless , those predicting that @entity17 would arrest their decline to race neck - on - neck with their rivals from @entity18 and @entity70 from the outset have been forced into a quick revision			1
@entity26 ' @entity17 side have endured a frustrating start to the season and are 7th in the @entity28 despite @entity26 ’ imaginative appointment , old habits – mostly bad – have died hard			1
yet @entity0 feels anyone anticipating some kind of uncontested three - way slug for first place makes no allowance for the environment in which the big guns are now operating			1
‘ i think it says more about the opposition and the standard more than anything else , ’ he added of @entity17 ’ form			1
‘ i ’m certainly not going to be critical of @entity17 who have played better football against us than probably anyone else this season			1
in the ( @entity103 ) @entity102 game , i felt they played exceptionally well at times			0
‘ we ’ve known all along that going to places like @entity58 and @entity108 is extremely difficult as these teams , if they play well , can surprise anyone in the country			0
’ if @entity17 were able to cast off that previous 2 - 1 @entity18 defeat with a degree of nonchalance given the second - rate competition it took place in , another loss would hugely lengthen the odds on them pipping their rivals at the post come may			1
so do @entity14 anticipate facing a @entity17 side even more focused than that which they defeated in august ? @entity14 midfielder @entity125 ( right ) injured himself last weekend but should be back for monday 's clash ‘ it ’s still really early in the season , but i do n’t think @entity17 will be wanting to win any more than they would normally when they come to our place , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ they were here earlier in the season and for long periods played really well			2
i would imagine @entity26 would have been delighted with that level of performance , if not with the result			1
so i do n’t think because of their league position they will come and play any harder			0
’ not that @entity14 can afford to lose any more ground on leaders @entity62 , either			1
a poor performance in a 1 - 1 draw at @entity58 last weekend left the @entity18 men three points and three goals behind a @entity70 side which entertain @entity145 on saturday			1
for so long the runaway leaders of @entity147 and two , @entity14 now find themselves recast as the men with ground to make up			2
‘ it ’s not something that ’s a shock to us , ’ @entity0 insisted			2
‘ we knew the league would be a massive step - up from the previous two seasons and when you lose the first game to @entity62 , chances are you will be chasing them for a wee while anyway			0
@entity14 ' defeated @entity162 3 - 1 in the @entity102 on tuesday with @entity163 grabbing the second goal ‘ we ’re six games into it , it ’s not really started the campaign , really			2
there are lots of points to be won and dropped			2
@entity62 drew at @entity64 and i felt the same way last week after the @entity58 game - that might turn out to be a good point rather than two dropped			0
‘ @entity62 are at the top and playing very well consistently			0
they had a good second half against @entity178 last weekend			0
for the first time in a couple of years we are looking above us but it ’s not a major shock or something we ’re overly concerned with this early in the season			2
’ regardless of the off - field concerns that are just part of the fixtures and fittings of @entity18 these days , @entity14 fans at least have competitive football to embrace each week			1
if there was initially a novelty about turkey shoots against plumbers and plasterers of the lower divisions , it soon passed			0
@entity0 ( left ) knows that there is a long way to go in the @entity28 season and @entity17 could recover now engaged in what ’s already an intriguing battle for an automatic return to the top flight , the days when indifferent league results just did n’t really matter are a thing of the past			1
‘ i think our players , in terms of their own self - motivation , have been commendable in the last couple of years , ’ @entity0 offered			2
‘ to go through a league season undefeated and with three draws would tell you that the motivation to go and play in all these league games has been fine			2
i really do think that			0
‘ you can argue about our levels of performance , of course you can , but in terms of motivation to go and play , the boys have been fine with that			0
‘ but i also think they are aware of the increase of the standard of the opposition and the better quality of grounds that we are going to , generally speaking , like @entity162 , @entity70 , @entity45 and places like that			0
‘ so there ’s an obvious step - up in everything			0
i think our motivation over the last two or three years has been absolutely fine , but it will have to stay at that level			0

@entity0 's @entity14 host @entity17 on monday
if the @entity18 side win the @entity28 clash they will be 10 points clear of @entity26 ' side
@entity17 were *relegated* from the @entity249 last season
they were expected to bounce *straight* back but have struggled so far
@entity0 insists his side wo *n't* take them lightly and it 's too early in the season to write anyone off
