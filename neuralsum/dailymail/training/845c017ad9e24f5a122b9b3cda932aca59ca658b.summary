rapidly freezing saltwater could provide the spark needed for life to flourish on icy worlds			0
this is according to a @entity6 - led research team that measured the electric potential in fast - freezing salty ice			1
during a process known as the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , they discovered ions take on a negative or positive charge at the boundary between ice and water			1
during a process known as the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , scientists discovered ions take on a negative or positive charge at the boundary between ice and water			1
pictured is glacial ice in the @entity24 they also found that the electrical potential created by this process could reach up to 230 volts - the same voltage supplied by many residential mains systems			1
this could lead to significant hydrogen and oxygen gas production , key ingredients for life , according to a report by @entity36 in @entity37			1
when a dilute solution of certain salts freezes rapidly , a potential electrical difference is created between the solid and liquid phases			2
for some salts , the ice receives a negative charge , for others , positive			1
researchers have found this electrical potential could reach up to 230 volts â€“ the same voltage supplied by many residential mains systems			1
this mechanism was thought to play a role in the charging of thunderstorms			0
now scientists believe it could help trigger significant hydrogen and oxygen gas production , key ingredients for life , on icy planets			1
the findings may have huge significance in the search for life on @entity66 's moon , @entity67			0
@entity67 's surface contains a significant amount of magnesium sulphate salts that could have formed by oxidation of a mineral originating from the ocean below			2
scientists believe that what can be observed on the surface of @entity67 may reflect what is underneath its surface			0
@entity81 missions between 1989 to 2003 , which studied @entity66 and its moons , suggests there is a chemical exchange between the ocean and surface			0
if the @entity11 process was to occur over a long period of time , the amount of oxygen produced ' would be substantial enough to support habitation , ' according to @entity92 , a geosciences student at the @entity93			2
' it may provide enough electric potential to drive initial chemical reactions that are essential to the production of life , ' he told @entity37			2
as well as cycling of material between the ocean and ice shell , it is believed that geysers spurting out of @entity66 's moon may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface			2
@entity67 's surface ( pictured ) contains a significant amount of magnesium sulphate salts			0
scientists believe that what can be observed on the surface of @entity67 may reflect what is underneath its surface this was based on observations by the @entity119 in december 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon , lending evidence to the existence of jets			0
in september , @entity66 's @entity125 has been found to have tectonic activity like @entity127			0
this was the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet .			0

@entity6 - led research team has measured electrical potential in salty ice
when it freezes , @entity11 creates a change in charge
ions take on a negative or positive charge between the ice and water
this could lead to significant hydrogen and oxygen gas production
