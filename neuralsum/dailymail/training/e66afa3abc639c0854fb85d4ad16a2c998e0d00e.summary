by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 10:34 est , 15 october 2012 a mother who has suffered the agony of losing two babies to heart defects is urging people to sign up to the organ donor register to prevent further tragedies			1
@entity8 , 27 , is racked with guilt for not agreeing to donate the organs of her first child , @entity11 , who died when he was just three - months - old			1
the decision came back to haunt her eight years later when her third child , @entity13 , needed a life - saving heart transplant - but died before one became available			1
tragic : @entity8 has lost two babies to heart defects and is calling on more people to become organ donors ' i wondered if it was payback for not donating @entity11 ’s organs			1
my guilt will stay with me for ever , ' she told @entity23 @entity8 , from @entity24 , was just 19 when she had @entity11 with her ex-husband , @entity25			1
he was born with a rare heart defect and died at the age of three months			1
@entity8 was asked at the time if she wanted to donate her baby 's organs but she refused ' without thinking '			1
' i felt guilty knowing a mum in the past was sitting feeling what i was ' ' i did n’t know anything about organ donation , so it was a shock			0
i was so angry and grief - stricken , ' she said of her feelings at the time			0
she went on to have son , @entity39 , who is now seven , with @entity25 but they split up three years later			0
she then met her second husband @entity41 , 31 , with whom she had son @entity13 , but tragedy struck the mother again when his heart failed and he needed a transplant in order to survive			2
praying for a heart donor for @entity48 to be found made the mother rue the day she had refused to donate her first child 's organs			1
guilt - ridden : @entity8 , pictured with son @entity39 , daughter @entity52 and husband @entity41			2
she said she will never get over not donating son @entity11 ' organs as they could have saved another baby 's life she said : ' when @entity13 fell ill i felt i was as two - faced as they come			1
i felt guilty knowing a mum in the past was sitting feeling what i was			0
' i ’d said no when i could ’ve possibly saved a child ’s life by simply saying yes			0
and then i needed someone else , another mother , to say yes for me			2
' ' i hoped that just one mum out there would have more strength and courage than i had ' doctors told her his condition was different to @entity11 ' so it was due to terrible ' bad luck ' and not genetics that @entity8 had two children with heart problems			1
@entity13 was placed at the top of the @entity78 donor list because of his critical condition but a donor was not found and in may last year he died just weeks before his second birthday			2
she said : ' we waited 60 agonising days but a donor heart could n’t be found			0
it then hit me , the heartache another poor woman had been forced to go through when i refused to donate @entity11 ' organs			2
' i hoped that just one mum out there would have more strength and courage than i had			0
i needed someone else , another mother , to say yes for me			0
' youngest on the list : @entity8 added daughter @entity52 to the donor register when she was just 52 hours old @entity8 is now supporting the ' @entity94 ' campaign to encourage people to sign up to the donor register so more lives may be saved in the future			2
she has already signed up daughter @entity52 , who was born in july this year			0
she said : ' when she was just 52 hours old i added her name to the organ donation list , making her the youngest person in the @entity78 to be on it			0
' my guilt will stay with me for ever but i hope that in telling my story other people will consider joining the donor register			0
