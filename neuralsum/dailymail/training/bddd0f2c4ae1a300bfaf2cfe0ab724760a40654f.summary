by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent archbishop @entity2 : he claims @entity3 and @entity4 lied about weapons of mass destruction archbishop @entity7 has demanded that @entity3 be tried in the @entity8 over the invasion of @entity10			1
the @entity12 winner accused the former prime minister of lying about @entity15 ’s weapons of mass destruction and said that the 2003 war had left the world more destabilised and divided than ‘ any other conflict in history ’			1
he said mr @entity3 should be subjected to a trial at the @entity22 , along with former @entity23 president @entity4			2
the archbishop claimed that the @entity23 and @entity26 - led military operation to oust @entity15 created the backdrop for the civil war in @entity29 and a possible wider @entity31 conflict involving @entity32			1
he said : ‘ the then leaders of the @entity23 and @entity34 fabricated the grounds to behave like playground bullies and drive us further apart			1
‘ they have driven us to the edge of a precipice where we now stand – with the spectre of @entity29 and @entity32 before us			0
' the question is not whether @entity15 was good or bad or how many people he massacred , the point is that mr @entity4 and mr @entity3 should not have allowed themselves to stoop to his immoral level			1
’ calling for the pair to face justice in @entity8 , he said different standards appeared to be set for prosecuting @entity50 leaders , and that the death toll during and after the @entity10 conflict was sufficient evidence for them to face action			0
accused : @entity4 and @entity3 who said today that archbishop @entity7 was wrong about the @entity10 war ‘ on these grounds alone , in a consistent world , those responsible should be treading the same path as some of their @entity50 and @entity64 peers who have been made to answer for their actions in @entity8 , ’ he said			1
archbishop @entity7 , a long - time critic of the @entity10 war , won the @entity12 in 1984 for speaking out against apartheid in his native @entity50			2

in response to the archbishop ’s remarks , mr @entity3 said that it was right to get rid of @entity15 because of the human rights abuses he perpetrated , and he argued that @entity10 was now a better place			2
he said : ‘ i have a great respect for archbishop @entity7 ’s fight against apartheid – where we were on the same side of the argument – but to repeat the old canard that we lied about the intelligence is completely wrong , as every single independent analysis of the evidence has shown			1
image of despair : @entity10 outside a morgue mourn the family victims of a bomb attack in @entity91 which killed 47 people ‘ and to say the fact that @entity15 massacred hundreds of thousands of his citizens is irrelevant to the morality of removing him is bizarre			0
’ he added : ‘ i would also point out that despite the problems , @entity10 today has an economy three times or more in size with child mortality rate cut by a third of what it was			0
and with investment hugely increased in places such as @entity107			0
’ yesterday , former @entity109 leader @entity108 declined to back archbishop @entity7 ’s call for a @entity8 trial			0
he said : ‘ when any question of crime is discussed in any jurisdiction , you have to ask yourself whether an act was committed and whether that act was committed with criminal intent			0
