by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 17:00 est , 15 december 2012 plunging temperatures , sore throats , lusty carol - singing and the drying effect of central heating are just a few elements of the @entity8 season that conspire against the vocal cords			1
professor @entity10 , director of the @entity11 at @entity12 , says : ‘ these things cause inflammation , irritation or infection of the larynx – also known as the voice box – leading to hoarseness , a sore throat and sometimes complete loss of voice			1
’ here , in the second instalment of our three - part festive series , experts provide practical tips to help ensure that your voice remains loud and clear amid the merry - making			1
carolling season : during christmas time you should be singing carols - not quieting down - so take care of your voice box @entity35 – with a sip of @entity37 the drier the vocal cords , the more inflamed they will become , so ensure you stay hydrated			1
‘ drink hot drinks every couple of hours if you can , ’ says prof @entity10			1
‘ these stimulate salivation and mucus secretions in the throat , which lubricate and soothe			1
@entity47 is good because the strong flavour stimulates saliva production , as does the lemon in @entity51 , which also contains paracetamol			1
’ give a traditional hot toddy a miss caffeine and alcohol have a dehydrating effect on the vocal cords			1
‘ it ’s traditional to have a hot toddy , but soaking the vocal cords in alcohol can do more harm than good , ’ says @entity59 , a professor of head and neck surgery at @entity62			1
if you must drink alcohol , opt for beer as it is less acidic and lower in alcohol than wine or spirits			1
limit tea or coffee consumption to four cups a day			1
shouting causes the vocal folds to slam together , which irritates the throat and promotes inflammation			1
‘ if you ’re losing your voice , try not to talk at all and , whatever you do , do n’t shout , ’ says prof @entity81			2
‘ if you have children or dogs , invest in a whistle			2
’ return your voice : do n't shout and do n't whisper			2
and do n’t whisper @entity88 can also put the vocal cords under strain because it stops them closing properly			1
‘ @entity88 involves moving a large amount of air through the larynx , which dries it out further , ’ prof @entity81 points out			2
‘ try to speak quietly instead			2
’ enjoy a spoonful of @entity96 ‘ a teaspoon of manuka honey , which has antibacterial properties , every two hours can help prevent as well as treat infected vocal cords , ’ says @entity97 , an expert in natural medicine and nutrition			1
‘ honey also helps to soothe and lubricate			2
’ @entity105 ‘ pour an extra mug of hot water every time you make a drink and inhale the steam , ’ says prof @entity81			2
‘ think of the larynx as being dry and cracked			2
a steam bath is like applying a moisturiser			2
’ find your inner yogi ‘ this exercise is a showbiz secret , ’ says @entity97			0
‘ the idea is to create a low larynx sound , like that made by cartoon character @entity121			0
this results in reducing the inflammation in the throat and vocal cords by increasing blood flow			1
‘ you can tell if you are talking in a low larynx sound by gently touching your @entity130 [ or where it would be if you are a woman ] and talking in a way that results in it dropping to a lower position in your throat			0
speak in this way for a few minutes , and then speak normally – your voice will sound better			0
‘ do it for a maximum of five minutes and then rest			0
just be careful not to force the voice			0
try this 30 minutes before going out to see whether you can improve the rasping tone			0
’ get your aspirin fix prof @entity81 recommends gargling with aspirin twice a day : ‘ dissolve a soluble aspirin in water and gargle for a few minutes			0
do n’t swallow as aspirin can irritate the stomach lining			0
’ avoid spicy food ‘ acid reflux is prevalent at this time of year because of the rich food and drink we indulge in , ’ points out mr @entity150 , an @entity151 consultant at @entity152			0
‘ stomach acid can irritate the throat so avoid spicy and oily food and eating late at night			0
’ @entity97 says : ‘ cutting mint tea out of the diet will help too			0
while this is great for preventing stomach spasms , it aggravates reflux			0
instead , try fennel or ginger			0
’ @entity167 ‘ there is no miracle cure to bring a voice back within a day but if you keep quiet during the hours leading up to the party , you might be able to regain some volume , ’ says prof @entity81			0
‘ whatever you do , do n’t push your voice			0
if you force sound out , you can cause bleeding on the vocal cords , which may mean months of recovery and even surgery			1
everyone loves a listener – it ’s quite likely you will be the most popular guest at the party			0
