@entity3 the chilled out @entity5 mastiff goes everywhere with her owner @entity6 , 46 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , joining him on his daily courier service			1
the beautiful dog is so used to her daily routine in the passenger seat , she now settles right in , resting her crossed paws on the edge of the window			1
top dog : roxy the @entity5 mastiff goes everywhere with her owner and has become totally content with her courier service routine she 's become so laid back as mr @entity6 's driving companion that people stop and laugh and take pictures of the adorable two - year - old pup			1
the friendly side - kick never leaves her owner 's side and has become a minor celebrity in and around central @entity9			1
pictured on swanky @entity32 , passers by take photos of themselves with the @entity3 , who always plays up to the cameras , mr @entity6 said			2
' i have queues and queues of people taking pictures of her - the most i have counted is 40 people			0
' ' as soon as she sees the flashes she will put her arm on the side of the van and sit there like a person , ' he said			0
there are few places @entity6 , pictured in the background , goes without his adorable , chilled out mastiff the reason mr @entity6 is never seen without his beloved @entity3 is because his wife wanted the dog out of the house because of his slobber ' if i pull up and open the window there will always be a queue there regardless			1
' @entity3 and mr @entity6 are inseparable because of a long - standing problem of slobber			1
his wife said @entity67 's drool was so bad she banished the dog from the house			0
sticking up for his companion , mr @entity6 took cute @entity71 to work and trained his companion to never leave his side , so he could clear up his slimy mess for her			2
father - of - three mr @entity6 , 46 , said : ' she has come with me since she 's been a pup , so she 's become comfortable sitting in the van			2
' she dribbles so my partner used to moan about her being at home dribbling and shaking it everywhere so it was better for her to sit in the van with me and shake it over me			0
' so smooth : chilled out @entity3 has become a minor celebrity in central @entity9 where mr @entity6 drives around every day on his courier service the dude : tourists stop to take pictures of the mastiff as she hangs out , looking completely relaxed @entity67 first joined mr @entity6 when she was just six months old			1
now she 's an old hand on his routine and dutifully leaps into the van every day			0
' she 's got a good nature , she 's very placid but if i 'm waiting for a job and i fall asleep nobody can get near to the van without her waking me up			0
' now you 'll never see one without the other - @entity67 even waits for mr @entity6 outside the toilet door .			0

@entity3 the @entity5 mastiff was banished from the house *due* to her drool

the chilled - out side - kick has become a minor celebrity in central @entity9
