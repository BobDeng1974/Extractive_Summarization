by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 inner circle : pope @entity5 's former butler was sentenced to 18 months jail stealing the @entity5 's private documents and leaking them to a journalist pope @entity5 ’s ex-butler @entity11 has been being found guilty of stealing confidential papers from him and sentenced to 18 months in jail – but is expected to shortly be granted a pardon			1
@entity11 , 46 , was given the prison term yesterday for his role in one of the worst scandals to hit the @entity18 in recent years , involving allegations of infighting , intrigue and nepotism , and corruption			1
prosecutors in the so - called ‘ @entity11 ’ case had asked the @entity18 court for a three - year sentence for the ex-butler – who had collected a huge number of stolen documents at his apartment within the @entity18			1
but the presiding judge @entity34 reduced the sentence on the grounds of @entity11 ’s service to the @entity38 and his apology to the @entity5 for betraying him			1
the @entity18 ’s spokesman @entity40 said after the verdict that the @entity5 was ‘ very likely ’ to pardon @entity11 , who claimed he had been motivated by a desire to root out ‘ corruption and evil ’ at the heart of the @entity38			1
@entity40 , who described the verdict as ‘ mild and fair ’ , said @entity11 would remain under house arrest ‘ while the @entity5 evaluates his position ’ , adding that he did not know when a pardon might be granted			1
the sentence was read out two hours after @entity11 , a father of three , gave a final address to the special court at the end of his week - long trial , insisting that he was not a thief			1
he said : ‘ the thing that i feel strongly in me is the conviction that i acted only out of visceral love for the @entity38 and for its visible head			1
i do not feel like i ’m a thief			0
’ @entity11 handed much of the @entity5 ’s stolen correspondence to journalist @entity61 , who wrote a book revealing the plotting and petty infighting at the top of the @entity38 , as well as allegations of corruption , nepotism and homosexual affairs			1
many of the documents contain criticism of the @entity18 ’s powerful secretary of state , cardinal @entity87 , who is seen as a divisive figure at the top of the @entity38			2
@entity11 ’s defence lawyer told the court that the former butler had merely photocopied documents and had leaked them out of a desire to ‘ do good ’			2
but @entity18 police and the @entity5 ’s private secretary , monsignor @entity97 , said that original documents were among the 82 boxes of evidence that they seized from the @entity18 apartment in may			2
some of them were so sensitive that they had been marked by @entity5 , in @entity105 , ‘ to be destroyed ’			2
at the end of the trial yesterday , as @entity11 looked on impassively , the judge said : ‘ in the name of his holiness pope @entity5 , who reigns in glory , and invoking the @entity114 ... this court sentences the defendant to three years in prison			1
’ but judge @entity34 then reduced the term , saying he had taken into consideration ‘ the absence of a criminal record , his service record preceding these charges and the subjective though erroneous motivation provided by the defendant as to his motivation ’			0
@entity11 ’s ‘ declaration of his acknowledgement of having betrayed the trust of the holy father ’ had weighed in his favour and led to a shorter sentence			0
he claimed he was helping the 85 - year - old pontiff as he feared @entity5 was being ‘ manipulated ’			1
