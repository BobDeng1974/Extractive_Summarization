small earthquakes linked to energy drilling are shaking @entity2 and southern @entity3 daily and may be dramatically increasing the chance of bigger and dangerous quakes			1
this once stable region is now just as likely to see serious damaging and potentially harmful earthquakes as the highest risk places east of the @entity9			0
a major quake is still a low risk , about a 1 in 2,500 years ' chance of happening , according to geophysicist @entity13 of the @entity14			1
' to some degree we 've dodged a bullet in @entity2 , ' @entity13 said after a presentation to the @entity19			2
above , an @entity2 man looks at damage from a 2011 quake the number of earthquakes in @entity2 has grown dramatically in the last several years , and the state saw 562 in 2014 but , he added , ' this is not to say we expect a large earthquake tomorrow			1
' the change in risk puts @entity2 on par with such areas as @entity38 , @entity39 , where residents are warned that a devastating earthquake in 1811 could receive a dangerous aftershock			1
during dr @entity13 's 90 - minute session on human - induced earthquakes , three quakes larger than 3.1 magnitude hit northern @entity2			1
federal records show that since jan. 1 , @entity2 has had nearly 200 quakes that people have felt			1
these quakes started to increase in 2008 and made dramatic jumps in frequency in june 2013 and again in february 2014 , dr @entity13 said			2
the state saw three times as many quakes larger than 3,0 magnitude in 2014 , according to @entity57 , the most perceptible tremors in the contiguous @entity59 saw 562 earthquakes to @entity61 's 180			1
' yeah , we are shaking all the time ... you put up with a few things falling off your walls , a few nights waking up with the shakes , ' @entity65 @entity64 manager @entity63 told @entity72			0
she said that energy drilling had benefited her town economically and did not discuss the possibility of large , damaging quakes			0
the @entity79 states ' earthquakes are mostly in areas with hydraulic fracturing , a process known as fracking			0
maintenance workers inspect the damage to one of the spires on @entity88 at @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity2 , after two earthquakes hit the area in less than 24 hours			2
many studies have linked the increase in small quakes to the process of injecting wastewater deep underground because it changes pressure and triggers dormant faults			2
until now , those quakes were mostly thought of as nuisances and not really threats			0
but dr @entity13 's continuing study , which is not yet published , showed the mere increase in the number of tiny temblors raises the risk of earthquakes that scientists consider major hazards			1
that 's generally above a magnitude 5 with older buildings and a magnitude 6 for modern ones , he said			0
' the more small earthquakes we have it just simply increases the odds we 're going to have a more damaging event , ' dr @entity13 said			0
a 2011 earthquake in @entity122 , @entity2 , was a 5.7 magnitude , causing some damage and hurting two people			1
some scientists have linked ground pressure changes from hydraulic fracking ( pictured ) to the increased seismic activity ( file photo , @entity131 ) some studies said that was a side effect of the drilling process , but other scientists are not convinced			1
experts at the science session said dr @entity13 's finding of a higher risk for big quakes makes sense			2
' we are worried about this , no question about it , ' said @entity147 , interim director of the @entity148			0
not all states with fracking and wastewater injections are seeing increased quakes and not all those with increased quakes , such as @entity154 and @entity155 , are at a higher risk for major quakes , dr @entity13 said			1
@entity159 and @entity155 , for example , are also now seeing fewer man - made quakes , he said			0
areas in the @entity162 in @entity163 and @entity164 , where there has been heavy drilling , have also not seen the same increase			0
much depends on geology and how the wastewater is injected , said @entity171 geophysics professor @entity170			0
he said industry and regulators can be smarter about where they inject wastewater and where they do not , and can avoid many of these problems .			0

@entity14 says risk of major earthquake elevated after fracking
surge in quakes thought to be linked to changes in ground pressure
@entity2 had triple @entity61 's number of *>* *3.0* magnitude quakes in 2014
2011 earthquake in @entity2 , 5.7 magnitude , hurt two people
