by @entity1 reporter published : 12:02 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 03:07 est , 21 november 2012 finance minister @entity2 has insisted the government 's plan to reduce unemployment and restore growth would bear fruit @entity9 's government has shrugged off the latest downgrade of its credit rating , saying that it just needs time for reforms to the sluggish economy to take root			1
in a setback for president @entity19 's @entity18 administration , @entity15 stripped @entity21 's second largest economy of it of its prized @entity23 credit rating yesterday over concerns that its rigid labour market and exposure to @entity21 's financial crisis were threatening its prospects for economic growth			1
this is the second ratings downgrade to have hit @entity9 this year : @entity32 's agency lowered its score in january			1
the third leading agency , @entity34 , still ranks @entity9 at the aaa - rating but warned it could still be downgraded			1
finance minister @entity2 insisted that @entity9 's credibility remains strong and that the government 's plan to reduce unemployment and restore growth would bear fruit			1
@entity9 has come under scrutiny as its £ 1.6trillion economy has stagnated , with many leading @entity9 companies laying off workers			1
meanwhile , @entity19 has struggled to reassure economists that his attempts to revive the @entity9 economy will be successful			1
@entity19 's administration has laid out a series of deficit - reduction targets , vowing to bring it in line with @entity21 rules next year			1
it has also unveiled a plan to improve the competitiveness of its economy , by giving companies £ 18billion in tax rebates , reducing red tape for businesses , and providing small companies with extra support to compete abroad			0
however , many economists say that the greatest threat to @entity9 's economy is its stringent labour rules , which make firing difficult and expensive and thus deter hiring			1
the country has been losing global business for years to more dynamic economies like @entity72 's , while fighting unemployment of 10.8per cent and concerns about the future of the eurozone			0
the @entity9 government is currently leading negotiations between businesses and unions in the hopes of reforming labour rules by the end of the year			1
@entity2 pleaded for time today , arguing that the government had inherited a difficult economic and budgetary situation from former president @entity87			0
he said the government is convinced it is now on the right path but that its reforms just need to take effect			0
' it takes time to reverse the flow of things			0
it takes courageous decisions , and that 's what we 're promising to do , ' he told reporters			0
to the ratings agencies , critics and investors , he said : ' judge us on our results			0
' issue : @entity9 has been losing global business for years to more dynamic economies like @entity72 's , while fighting unemployment of 10.8per cent and concerns about the future of the eurozone @entity9 and @entity112 , which underpin the group of 17 @entity115 countries that use the euro , have taken the lead in finding solutions to the continent 's debt crisis			1
any slip in @entity9 's clout could endanger its ability to lead negotiations			1
in an early sign of how the rating could affect the eurozone ability to solve its financial crisis , its bailout fund was forced to cancel a bond auction today			0
officials with the @entity132 said the downgrade caused a technical problem since the @entity132 's rating is now higher than that of @entity9 , which is a major backer of the fund			1
@entity132 cfo @entity139 did not say how the glitch would be resolved but said he thought it was a possibility			0
the @entity132 has been replaced by the @entity142 , but is still handling the bailouts of @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
@entity2 also insisted that relations with @entity112 remained strong			0
there have been reports recently that @entity112 is concerned about the health of the @entity9 economy			2
but @entity112 finance minister @entity152 seemed unconcerned about the downgrade			0
' we have received the news that , overnight , our most important partner got a little admonition from a rating agency , ' @entity152 said in the @entity159			2
' the rating for @entity9 is still very stable , so that we avoid any dramatisation			2
' many leading @entity9 companies have laid off workers as the economy stagnates			2
here union workers hold a poster reading ' austerity for salary and @entity169 , enough ' during a protest in january @entity15 's itself said that the rating remains as high as it does - now @entity15 , just a notch below triple - a - because of the size of the @entity9 economy and the government 's commitment to make structural reforms			1
it kept the rating 's outlook at negative , meaning it could face future downgrades			2
the downgrade , like @entity32 's before it , appeared to be having a limited effect on @entity9 's borrowing costs			1
the yield , or interest rate , on the benchmark 10 - year bond was up 0.05 percentage points to 2.01 per cent this afternoon			0
@entity112 's was up the same rate to 1.39 per cent			0
@entity2 said he expected the country to continue to be able to borrow at those historically low rates because of the seriousness of its reform package			0
analysts warned , however , that @entity9 banks could next face downgrades , since they are significant holders of @entity9 government debt and ultimately backed by the government			2
@entity206 , analyst at @entity207 , said : ' the move was widely expected by markets but still proves a blow to @entity9 's new government headed by @entity19 , who will face increased pressure to find ways to generate growth			2
' the @entity215 was slightly down as @entity217 investors were mellowed by the mood in @entity21 .			0
