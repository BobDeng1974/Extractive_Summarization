' as part of his @entity11 charity , @entity2 built the @entity14 to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education and the initiative is being awarded speaking about the award , @entity21 founder @entity21 , who selected @entity2 's work , told @entity28 : ' we always select programmes to receive this award that are relatively unsung heroes , doing interesting , innovative and important work but not yet well known ' the @entity21 , which takes place in may , is the biggest charity event in @entity55 supporting people with @entity6 and is being dubbed @entity55 's answer to the @entity58 thanks to it 's dazzling guestlist			1
speaking about the origins of the glittering event , @entity21 said : ' @entity21 was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80 ’s and early 90 ’s - particularly in the fashion industry - that saw @entity6 as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying , but that no one understood or was willing to talk about			1
' there was this undercurrent of urgency to do something : to help , to get involved and make some noise			0
' my main goal with the first @entity21 was to bring a spotlight to the disease , the fundraising aspect was a secondary consideration			0
' prince @entity2 's award will be announced at @entity83 , pictured , which is the biggest charity event in @entity55 supporting people with @entity6 or @entity6 and is being dubbed @entity55 's answer to the @entity58 @entity21 set up the event in 1992 with the goal of the show being to be provocative and have @entity6 and the taboo that it represented acknowledged @entity21 , left , pictured with sir @entity91 , centre , set up @entity83 in 1992 to raise vital funds the event , which has attracted the likes of @entity96 , left , and @entity97 , aims to get people talking about @entity6 , which @entity21 says was a daily issue profoundly effecting his friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about @entity21 aimed to marry the unique and prolific ball tradition that they have in @entity105 , and combine the splendour of the @entity107 with modern , liberal ideals to celebrate life			1
' at that time , the goal of the show was to be provocative as we were aiming to cause a stir and have @entity6 and the taboo that it represented acknowledged , ' he explained			0
' when in 1993 one of my clients , @entity116 ’s main stylist , died of the disease , he agreed to do the fashion show and so @entity21 as a standalone event was born			2
' i had no conceivable idea what i was taking on , it was me and a fax machine in six square meters of office space in my client 's kitchen			0
i funded it entirely from my own pocket and did n’t really know if anyone was going to attend but knew that we had to do something			0
' @entity21 aimed to marry the unique and prolific ball tradition that they have in @entity105 with more liberal ideas ( @entity136 pictured at the event ) @entity21 says this year 's @entity21 , which takes place in @entity105 , will ' undoubtedly be better than ever ' @entity21 ' strongly believes ' that a cure for @entity6 is on the horizon and hopes to make as much noise about it as possible via his glittering event from there , a huge event was born and the likes of @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 were among the first guests			1
the event is now listed as one of the top 50 hiv / aids fundraisers in the world and has partnered with @entity91 ’s @entity156 , @entity96 ’s @entity157 and @entity158			2
@entity21 says this year ’s @entity21 will ' undoubtedly be better than ever '			0
the event will be continuing its work with @entity91 ’s foundation , supporting the crucial work that they do , and @entity164 will be attending as part of the foundation			2
adding some high fashion glamour to the event , @entity167 is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work twenty years after he first showed there			0
with gold as this year ’s @entity21 theme , taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque @entity175 , the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well - connected @entity167			0
' it is really perfect timing to have @entity184 back this year , ' said @entity21			0
' it has been twenty years since he was part of the @entity21 and we are at such an exciting time in our medical fight against @entity6 that his presence is a wonderful reminder of how far we have come			1
' the event is now listed as one of the top 50 hiv aids fundraisers in the world and has attracted guests such as @entity197 , left , and @entity198 and @entity149 , right @entity199 has performed at the event in previous years and 2015 will welcome @entity167 and @entity202 @entity167 's show will be watched from the front row by actress @entity202 , who will attend on behalf of her foundation @entity205			1
@entity206 will join a bevy of a-list celebrities and performers , who pour into @entity105 annually to help fight against @entity6 at the world ’s largest @entity6 event			2
the @entity205 , based in her home country of @entity215 , is dedicated to addressing @entity6 in adolescents across @entity217 through education , grant giving , networking and community outreach			0
@entity206 will give a keynote speech at the @entity223 at the @entity224 in @entity105 ahead of attending the @entity21 , where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and @entity6 - free generation			1
so who would @entity21 love to host ? ' we have long been aware of prince @entity233 ’s continued support of @entity6 organisations , much like his brother , following in the footsteps of their mother and would naturally consider supporting any relevant programme			1
' he and the @entity240 are both welcome guests at @entity21 , ' he said			2
@entity21 wo n't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change @entity21 ' strongly believes ' that a cure for @entity6 is on the horizon and that the leap forward that was affordable generic medication was crucial to the fight for survival for the 34 million people in the world living with @entity6			1
' ironically we have further to go in the fight against social @entity6 than we do the medical disease now and thus it is this fight that we must be equally concerned with , ' he said			0
but that 's where the @entity21 comes in - and he wo n't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change			0
he concludes : ' @entity21 is symbolic , it is a unique weekend in the year in which the world ’s most significant @entity6 organisations come together , stand together , fight together and continue to fight for those who are not able to fight for themselves			2
' it is my constant desire for @entity21 weekend to expand , to obtain more friends , have better connections , help more programmes and become internationally known for fighting social @entity6 as well as the disease itself			2
