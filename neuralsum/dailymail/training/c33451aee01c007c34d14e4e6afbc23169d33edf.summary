by @entity0 published : 04:06 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 04:17 est , 30 april 2013 when the @entity2 landed at @entity3 in 1620 to start a new colony , they ensured that the name of @entity6 would be immortalised in @entity8 history for ever			2
but now it has been claimed that their ship , the @entity11 , should not be associated with the city in @entity13 which it set out from , but with the @entity16 port town of @entity17			1
the ship which transported the enterprising @entity19 across the @entity20 was apparently built in @entity16 , and may have made only a brief stop - over in @entity6 as it began its journey			1
voyage : the @entity11 set sail from @entity6 , pictured , but may have actually been built in @entity17 , @entity16 the @entity2 named their landing place ' @entity26 ' , meaning that every schoolchild in the @entity8 has heard of the city on the south coast of @entity30			1
@entity6 is currently gearing up for the 400th anniversary of the fateful landing , which will fall at the end of this decade			0
officials are planning a series of events to celebrate the voyage , and have even invited the future president of the @entity8 to attend - seven years in advance			0
if the president does decide to go to the festivities in @entity6 , he or she will find the name ' @entity11 ' adorning dozens of sites and businesses in the city , including a museum , school and sailing club			0
iconic : a replica of the @entity11 , which transported the @entity2 to what is now @entity53 but @entity17 , on the east coast , insists that it should be the town remembered as the birthplace of the @entity11 , and residents are planning a rival set of anniversary celebrations			1
the ship was described in some port documents as ' @entity11 of @entity17 ' , and the main builder was a native of @entity17 , implying that that is where it was probably built			1
its voyage to the @entity67 seems to have begun in @entity68 , where it picked up passengers at the @entity72 docks before travelling on to @entity73 and then @entity6			0
the @entity2 themselves came from a number of different places in @entity77 , with at least four of them being from @entity16 , although none seems to have had pre-existing links to @entity13			1
campaigners at the @entity82 have launched a Â£ 2.5million plan to build a life - size replica of the boat and sail it across the @entity20			0
true home ? residents of @entity17 , pictured , are campaigning for recognition of its place in @entity8 history far off : @entity17 , on @entity30 's east coast , is 330 miles away from @entity6 on the south coast organiser @entity94 told @entity95 : ' @entity6 has grabbed the limelight but the vessel has much closer ties with @entity17 , where she was built			1
' it may put @entity6 noses out of joint , but we are determined that everyone should know of @entity17 's role			1
' another supporter , @entity104 , claimed that @entity6 had ' hijacked the ship and claimed it as their own ' , pointing out that many of @entity109 's early settlers were proud of their @entity111 roots			2
he has lodged a legal claim to block any attempt by the @entity13 city to claim ownership of the @entity11			1
however , while the ship may have started life in @entity16 , it is unlikely to shake its association with @entity6 any time soon			0
a spokesman for @entity120 told @entity95 : ' the @entity11 departed from @entity6 on september 8 , 1620 , nearly 400 years ago on its @entity2 voyage to @entity122			2
' the journey and the vessel are a piece of our country 's history and we are proud to celebrate being a part of that			0
' @entity131 , founded by the @entity2 after they landed in the @entity11 at @entity3 in november 1620 , is one of the best - known @entity8 colonies despite not being the first			2
its fame is partly because it was the first community in what would become the @entity8 to be founded by @entity19 fleeing religious persecution , establishing the @entity67 's reputation as a land of tolerance and freedom			0
the @entity2 were mostly @entity30 men , women and children who had been banned from worshipping as they wished thanks to strict laws against all christian denominations outside the @entity149			0
many had previously fled to @entity150 , in the @entity151 , but seized the opportunity to found a new community based on the spirit of religious equality			0
they travelled in the @entity11 from @entity68 via @entity6 , and made landfall at a spot they called ' @entity26 ' , founding a colony of settlers nearby			1
despite widespread illness and harsh conditions , the community survived , and in late 1621 held a ceremony which later became known as the origins of the @entity167 holiday			0
the settlement founded by the @entity2 has remained continuously occupied for nearly 400 years , and is now the town of @entity6 , @entity53 .			2

@entity2 sailed from @entity13 and named landing site ' @entity26 '
but the @entity11 was apparently built in port town of @entity17 , @entity16
residents campaign to recognise town 's role in founding of @entity109
