by @entity0 published : 07:11 est , 7 march 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 7 march 2013 a @entity2 - owned oil company caused outrage this week after flying flags at half - mast at its @entity7 office after the death of @entity9			1
@entity10 , which is owned by the @entity2 government , lowered its flags as a tribute to the late president , incensing residents in @entity16 , @entity17 , and @entity18 , @entity19 , who said they were offended by the gesture			1
protocol allows flags to be lowered for foreign dignitaries , but @entity9 was a controversial leader who as was antagonistic towards the @entity25 jarring : the @entity10 flags at half mast to honor president @entity9 in @entity16 , @entity17 protocol allows flags to be lowered for foreign dignitaries , but @entity9 was a contentious leader and often seen as antagonistic towards the @entity25 in particular			1
@entity31 , an assistant project manager at an engineering and construction firm , told @entity34 that it was ' jarring ' and ' deeply disappointing '			0
@entity35 said that his mind ' immediately jumped to the last time we did this in the @entity16 - area and it was for @entity41			1
' controversial leader : the late @entity2 vice president @entity9 @entity44 , a financial adviser in @entity19 , said that the flags at the @entity10 refinery in @entity18 had been raised back by noon			1
' i think i used a profanity when i saw it this morning , i was disgusted , ' @entity47 said			0
' i did n't believe it to be right , not for somebody who was n't a true @entity7 ally			0
' at one point mr @entity9 even blamed the @entity25 government for his cancer			1
@entity9 suggested in 2011 that the @entity25 might have ' invented technology to spread cancer ' , and warned other left - wing heads of state that they could be targeted next			1
his comments came after @entity61 's @entity60 became the fifth @entity7 president to contract the disease			0
@entity9 's anti-american sentiment culminated in a particularly ill - judged joke when president of @entity68 @entity67 came to visit @entity2 last year			2
@entity67 and @entity9 mocked the @entity25 and joked about directing ' a big atomic bomb ' at @entity70			1
courting @entity67 was part of an overriding policy of befriending rivals of the @entity25 throughout his 14 - year rule			2
@entity68 , with whom he had close ties , immediately declared a day of mourning for its former ally who ' loathed @entity25 imperialism '			2
@entity10 released a statement saying that @entity9 ' leaves behind a legacy of support for the underprivileged and promotion of social justice that transcends geographical boundaries			2
' they did not explain the flag lowering directly but said : ' we at @entity10 are deeply saddened by the news of his passing			0
' ' our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of @entity2 in this time of grief			0
' one of his final pictures : @entity9 , centre , with his daughters , @entity104 , left , and @entity105 on february 14 this year when his health was already in rapid decline mourning in @entity108 : crowds gathered in the streets to honour late @entity2 president , @entity9 @entity9 , who was 58 , died after a two - year cancer battle that has been shrouded in secrecy			2
his death was also mysterious as claims emerged that he died in a @entity117 hospital instead of a military hospital in @entity2 's capital , @entity108			0
@entity9 will lie in state until his funeral on friday			0
the vote for a new president should be held within 30 days and will probably pit the socialist vice president @entity124 against @entity125 , the centrist leader and state governor who lost to @entity9 in the october .			0

@entity9 was a *highly* *outspoken* *critic* of the @entity25
last time flags were lowered in @entity16 was the death of @entity41
*locals* left ' disgusted ' and ' disappointed '
