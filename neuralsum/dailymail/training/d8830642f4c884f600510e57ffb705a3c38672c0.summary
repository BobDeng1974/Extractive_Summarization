an it expert has been left in a web of fear after a massive spider has moved into his home			2
@entity4 , 43 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , filmed his encounter with the eight - legged fiend after spotting a funnel - shaped cobweb outside his house			1
he used a stick to poke it but as he did a large , green - fanged spider came charging out of its nest			1
the it worker believes it is a tube - web spider and says it 's doubled in size since he first noticed it in august the father - of - three says the spider has doubled in size since he first noticed it in august and fears the colder weather could make his home a welcome invite for the arachnid			1
mr @entity4 believes the spider is a segstria fiorentina – more commonly known as the tube - web spider			1
the spiders sow distinctive tube - shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands			1
they first entered the @entity43 150 years ago from continental @entity44 , arriving on ships docking in ports such as @entity5			0
their bites are non-fatal but can cause a sharp injection - like pain lasting for hours			1
although the spiders are still an unusual sight , experts warn the long , hot summer is helping them thrive			1
the spider can be seen darting out the hole checking for prey after mr @entity4 poked it with a stick mr @entity4 said : ‘ by the look of it i would say it had more than doubled in size from when i first saw it two months ago			1
‘ i decided to tease it out so i got a piece of grass and poked the outside of its web			0
‘ it instantly charged out to grab the piece of grass			0
it is a really aggressive little thing , no fear at all			0
’ tube - web spiders ( @entity74 ) is the largest @entity44 spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm			1
originally from the @entity80 , they can be found as far east as @entity81 but are also commonly spotted in @entity43 - particularly in the later half of the year			0
they have a black or dark brown body , often with a green shine on their fangs			0
while their bite has no long lasting effects , it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours			2
they are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it			1
sightings of the spider in @entity43 have in the past been confused with the deadly @entity107 funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique			2
he added : ‘ i think it is a tube - web spider , and i was surprised to hear it has such a painful bite , like being stabbed with a nail			1
‘ it ’s something i ’d like to avoid , let ’s put it that way			0
’ mr @entity4 , who is married but is separated from his wife , continued : ‘ i ’m not worried about getting bitten right now as it ’s quite out the way			2
but if it heads inside for the winter then i might be in trouble			0
’ tube - web spiders are one of the largest spiders in @entity44 and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches , moths , bees and wasps			1
the females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm			0
@entity136 , a naturalist and former @entity138 radio presenter , said the tube web - spider might look scary but says it ’s not dangerous to humans			2
he said : ‘ it bites in defence so if you pick one up , or it gets caught in your clothing , you are likely to be nipped			0
but no @entity43 spider delivers a fatal bite or even one dangerous to humans			0
‘ it seems this spider was accidentally introduced into @entity43 from its native @entity80 and @entity152			0
‘ it sits at the mouth of its tunnel in old brickwork or behind loose bark or any other suitable hole , waiting for a hapless insect to stumble across the spokes - tripwires that alert the spider to its victim			2
‘ once detected , the spider moves like lightning			0
i defy anybody not to jump when this happens as it is such a surprise even if you are expecting it			0
‘ the prey is dragged back into the narrow tube and eventually the spider ’s venom overcomes the prey			2
’ a tube - web spider , which was spotted last week in @entity176 , are believed to be the biggest in @entity44			1
