a mother - of - two has revolutionized the concept of the traditional family photograph with a series of controversial images entitled ' @entity5 '			1
after spending years as a ' helicopter mother ' who hovered around her children taking a constant stream of photos - while never actually featuring in any family images herself - former dancer @entity6 came up with the idea for the unique photography project , which she felt would allow her to turn the camera on herself for once and ' project some sort of emotional honesty '			1
' i needed a creative outlet of my own - one in which i called the shots and controlled everything so no questions or insecurities remained unanswered , ' the actress told @entity25			0
' i think it was a call to power on my part ! ' i needed a creative outlet ' : @entity6 's @entity5 project allowed her to create a series of characters which draw on her own ' dark thoughts ' dark and daring : many of the images , such as @entity36 ( pictured ) challenge the traditional perceptions of ' normal ' family life ' who is the adult ? ' @entity6 uses the images to highlight current issues - such as the increasing number of young people who have access to guns , which features clearly in ' toy ' ( pictured ) ' i loved not having to make myself into someone ’s else projection or image , i was able to be exactly as i wanted , for an ex-dancer and actor this was huge			1
' each of the images within the @entity5 series has what @entity6 calls a ' twist of darkness ' , a daring element that challenges the normal perceptions of family happiness and forces viewers to look beyond the surface of the photo			2
and more than that , they have given @entity6 the chance to put herself at the forefront of family life by altering the day - to - day dynamic of her roles as both a mother and a wife			1
' i wanted to explore living vicariously through character since my life became about taking care of my daughters and husband and home and as much as i love them i needed to express more , ' she said			2
' i wanted to feel relevant again and create something honest and courageous			2
i did n’t want to fall through the cracks of domesticity			0
' although she describes her role in each image as a ' character ' , @entity6 admits that she drew on her own personal experiences and emotions in order to find inspiration for each one			0
' i did n't want to fall through the cracks of domesticity ' : after spending years taking pictures of her children , @entity6 wanted to put herself back in the forefront of her family photos look again : each of the images within the @entity5 series has what @entity6 calls a ' twist of darkness ' the ' twist of darkness ' is her daring element that challenges the normal perceptions of family happiness ' i dwell in the dark thoughts and recesses of my mind to create character and subject , in order to project them into a frozen moment of time , allowing the story to continue to unfold bilaterally for the viewer , ' @entity6 writes on her website			1
' i feel a certain freedom to live vicariously through these characters to engage , seek to navigate ( and , no less , avoid ) , both my own personal imperatives as woman , artist , mother , and wife , as well as those – personal , social and cultural – that are imposed on me by others			0
' while many of the images draw on @entity6 's personal thoughts and feelings , a number also highlight current issues and problems within society			0
