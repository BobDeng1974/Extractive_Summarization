as the debate continues to drag on about @entity3 ’s midfield role at @entity4 , one man could be forgiven for wondering just what he has done wrong			1
@entity6 cost @entity4 £ 29million			1
sir @entity7 identified his potential , @entity9 did the donkey work to extricate the @entity12 star from his complex contract at @entity14 , and @entity15 rubber - stamped his signing before officially taking over at @entity17 last summer			2
@entity6 has made just six @entity18 starts under the @entity19 , however , and none since playing against @entity21 at the start of december			2
@entity6 cost @entity4 £ 29million , but he has spent more time watching than playing so far @entity6 has been told he must fight for his place , but @entity4 fans have called for him to get more playing time @entity6 makes a point to team - mates @entity27 and @entity29 during some rare time on the pitch the situation has mystified many @entity4 fans who hope that @entity6 will be given a chance at @entity35 in the @entity37 fifth round on monday night having done well in the competition so far this season			1
the @entity40 scored with a wonder strike to break the deadlock at @entity43 in the fourth round – his only other start in the last two - and - a - half months – and then came off the bench to set up a goal for @entity48 in the fourth round replay against @entity50			2
yet he still seems to have some way to go to win the trust of @entity53 and his coaching staff			0
there is a feeling around the club that he has not bought into the manager ’s strict ‘ philosophy ’ quite as well as some of his teammates			0
@entity63 congratulates @entity29 and @entity64 after the central defender had scored a goal @entity15 has not started @entity6 in 2015 , and is in the market for another creative midfielder it appears as though @entity6 is paying the price for his below - par performances against @entity72 in september , when @entity4 fell apart in a 5 - 3 defeat , and @entity74 the following month when he was taken off at half - time			1
@entity53 has challenged @entity6 to improve , warning that competition for places in his midfield diamond could limit his opportunities			2
@entity80 and @entity64 followed the @entity40 into @entity17 last summer , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 were already in situ , and that was before the decision came to re-deploy @entity3			1
‘ i have to compare him with people like @entity3 and @entity82 , for example , so that ’s difficult , ’ said @entity53 earlier this month			1
‘ they are all at a high level , he has to improve			0
‘ he ’s a great guy , a very great professional also , so that ’s not the problem			0
his problem is he has to compete with high level players and @entity3 is also the captain so he has a privilege			0
with the arrival of @entity64 to join @entity82 in the creative midfield role , @entity6 has been sidelined @entity3 ( far left ) and @entity80 ( right ) complete @entity53 's first choice diamond ‘ we are playing now with a @entity101 and that ’s @entity82 and @entity64			1
that ’s difficult to compete against , but he already knew that when he signed for @entity4			0
‘ when you sign for a top club like he did he knows that he is had to fight but he is fighting			0
’ it ’s only four months , however , since @entity6 was deemed so important to @entity4 that he was hurried back from a rib injury and @entity53 allowed him to play in a protective corset on that disappointing night at the @entity109 when he was replaced by @entity110 for the second half			1
@entity53 has kept @entity6 on the bench but the @entity40 could get his chance against @entity35 on monday now , @entity6 must warm the bench while @entity53 claims he has to play @entity3 in midfield because there are no better options			1
it is quite a snub , and the manager ’s admission that he will look to sign a world - class midfielder in the summer to release the @entity123 striker back to the front line does little to ease concerns that his future at @entity17 is increasingly uncertain			0
@entity6 , who has also been forced to protest his innocence after being caught up in a match - fixing scandal in @entity129 since his move to @entity131 , must wonder if he is in danger of going the same way as @entity134			0
for the time being , a player who arrived in @entity123 with such great expectations last summer just has to be patient – and hope for a chance to play against @entity35 .			0

@entity4 paid £ 29million for the @entity40 last summer
@entity6 has started just six @entity18 games , falling behind @entity3 , @entity64 , @entity82 and @entity80 in pecking order
with @entity15 in the market for more midfielders , @entity6 needs to make his mark
