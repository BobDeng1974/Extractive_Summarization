nearly 800 people have had surgical instruments left inside them after having an invasive procedure at a hospital since 2005 , according to a new report			1
the report from @entity6 , a non-profit health care safety watchdog , shows there were 772 incidents of foreign objects left in patients between 2005 and 2012 , resulting in 16 deaths			1
equipment like sponges , towels , needles , instruments , retractors and other small items and fragments of tools have been found in patients			1
horror operation : there were 772 incidents of foreign objects left in patients between 2005 and 2012 , resulting in 16 deaths forgotten : equipment like sponges , towels , needles , instruments , retractors and other small items and fragments of tools have been found in patients the researchers found the most common causes of these incidents were due to human error and a lack of policies and procedures			1
the report notes that doctors traditionally rely on protocols like counting all of their tools or conducting ‘ cavity sweeps ’ to look for equipment			1
about 80 per cent of retained sponges occur when the nurses and doctors think they 've had a correct count			0
in 95 per cent of the cases , patients had to stay longer in the hospital , according to @entity52			2
the most common sites these incidents occurred were operating rooms , labour and delivery rooms , ambulatory surgery centres or labs where invasive procedures such as catheters or colonoscopies take place			0
final count : doctors traditionally rely on protocols like counting all of their tools or conducting ' cavity sweeps ' to look for equipment an incident was nine times more likely when an operation was performed in an emergency basis and four times more likely when the procedure changed unexpectedly			1
@entity74 , a nurse from @entity75 is one of those unlucky people to have experienced this first hand			0
she became violently ill in 2005 , only to undergo a ct scan and find out a surgical sponge had been left in her abdomen during a hysterectomy four years earlier			2
‘ what they found was horrific , ’ @entity74 told the @entity81 in 2012			2
‘ it had adhered to the bladder and the stomach area , and to the walls of my abdominal cavity			0
’ she added , ‘ i never dreamed something like this would happen to me			0
’ the @entity6 says she suffered severe health issues , anxiety , depression and disability			2
@entity74 sued the hospital where the surgery took place for $ 2.5 million , but the award was appealed			0
human error : about 80 per cent of retained sponges occur when the nurses and doctors think they 've had a correct count ' open communication ' : @entity105 , executive vice president and chief medical officer at @entity6 , who did the report			1
she says it is critical that hospitals comply with procedures the watchdog is now calling for a stricter , more standardised counting system involving all members of the hospital team , including surgeons , nurses , techs , anesthesiologists , and radiologists			1
they recommend two people - a nurse and tech - count out all the equipment and have it verified by a surgeon			0
the counts should be performing them before the surgery begins , before the cavity is closed and at the time the procedure ends			0
a whiteboard can display the count , and the team should debrief to address any concerns about equipment or the procedure			0
such a system was shown to reduce errors at one children 's hospital by 50 per cent in only one year			0
‘ it 's critical to establish and comply with policies and procedures to make sure all surgical items are identified and accounted for , as well to ensure that there is open communication by all members of the surgical team about any concerns , ’ said dr @entity139 , chief medical officer of @entity6 in a statement on their website .			1
