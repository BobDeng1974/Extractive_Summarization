the loss of 26 networks – including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 – to 20million homes means the size , length and scope of this programming blackout was unprecedented to date in the @entity23 pay - tv industry			1
contentious relationships between program distributors and program makers are on the rise as the industry 's growth appears to have peaked			0
' for the first time in memory , it was the distributor that won the public relations war			0
' while distributors typically take the brunt of the complaints about network blackouts , @entity2 argued that the increasing number of disputes with other distributors had educated customers that they would face the same problems with their rivals			0
' by showing their willingness to take a blackout , and arguably winning the battle for the hearts and minds of their customers as a result , @entity2 may extract better terms from other programmers down the road , ' said @entity41			0
@entity10 said it restored all of its cable networks , including @entity16 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity75 , which became unavailable to @entity2 customers from july 10			1

the companies did not disclose the financial terms of the new contract			0
but people familiar with the talks said @entity2 will pay @entity10 around $ 600million in the first year of the seven - year contract with subsequent mid-single digit percentage increases			1
that would be a 20 per cent increase over the previous contract 's $ 500million a year that was publicly stated by @entity2 chief executive @entity108			1
@entity2 previously said @entity10 sought a 30 per cent increase in carriage fees , equalling $ 1billion over five years - a boost that @entity2 said was not justified			1
@entity10 countered that its networks represented about 20 per cent of all viewing on @entity2 but accounted for less than 5 per cent of its programming costs			1
@entity10 ceo @entity116 said in the memo to staff that on thursday afternoon the two companies had made a ' decisive push to hammer out a deal that we believe is fair and mutually beneficial			0
' in particular , @entity2 had pushed back against having the @entity124 movie channel tacked on the agreement , at a price of around $ 500million			2
' they took @entity124 off the table in the last 24 hours and we could move ahead with a deal , ' said @entity130 , @entity2 's top programming negotiator			2
mad viewers : on july 1 , @entity134 , the company behind shows such as 1960s period drama @entity135 was removed from the @entity137 after the two companies failed to reach a new contract master of satire @entity140 of the @entity142 poked fun at the severe manner with which the blackout was being reported			0
‘ @entity10 and @entity2 , what are you doing here ? telling people to rise up and demand it like it ’s some sort of basic cable @entity152 ? i got news for you – it ’s not ! none of this is indispensable ! ’ but so some of the 20million viewers would still get the full @entity142 experience , he sent correspondent @entity158 to a couple ’s home in @entity161 , @entity162 , to tell them – verbatim – what they were missing			1
no doubt viewers of the comedy news show will be relieved to get the real thing back			0
watch the video below ' the attention surrounding this unnecessary and ill - advised blackout by @entity10 has accomplished one key thing : it serves notice to all media companies that bullying tv providers and their customers with blackouts wo n't get them a better deal , ' said @entity130			2
on july 1 , @entity178 , the company behind shows such as @entity180 , @entity181 , was removed from the @entity137 after the two companies failed to reach a new contract			0

@entity2 and @entity10 had been in talks over a new contract but could not agree on terms before the july 10 deadline			2
the nine days of the blackout resulted in @entity10 's channels such as @entity16 losing ground to competitors like the @entity202			1
@entity2 also shed some customers in the period			0
