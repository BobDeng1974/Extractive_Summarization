despite only occupying 1 per cent of the @entity3 's land mass , @entity1 's rainforests are home to 12 per cent of mammal species in the world including the @entity8 rhino and the @entity10 fruit bat			1
the region tops the list of countries with the most threatened mammals , according to maps based on data from the @entity17			1
and @entity18 is second , with 114 endangered mammals , while @entity20 sits in third with 101			1
the @entity21 has created maps plotting which countries have the most threatened mammals			2
the firm used the @entity17 's @entity24 for @entity26 and biodiversity figures the maps were designed by @entity28 - based the eco experts using the @entity17 's @entity24 for deforestation and biodiversity figures			1
@entity1 sits at the top of the list because deforestation in the region is leaving many species at risk , including orangutans and critically endangered @entity8 tigers and rhinos			1
@entity45 - 54 in @entity18 , lemurs are one of the most at risk species , as are shrew tenrecs			1
there are 105 recognised species of lemur , of which 24 are critically endangered , 49 are endangered , 20 are vulnerable and three are near - threatened			2
in @entity20 , the loss of habitat as a result of agriculture and fishing has already driven many species close to extinction			2
for example , vaquita is the world ’s rarest marine mammal			0
the small porpoise was n't discovered until 1958 but there are now said to be fewer than 100 in the wild			0
in @entity40 there are 82 endangered mammals			1
experts from @entity71 recently surveyed households in the cities of @entity74 and @entity75 to find out which animals they hunt and eat from the rainforest			0
the @entity78 has five endangered mammals , but these are almost exclusively marine mammals such as seals and whales that have come under threat from over fishing , including the blue whale , the fin whale , the sei whale and the @entity89 right whale despite only occupying 1 % of the @entity3 's land mass , @entity1 's rainforests are home to 12 % of mammal species in the world			1
these include the @entity96 , the @entity97 and the @entity98 @entity1 sits at the top of the list because deforestation in the region is leaving many species at risk including orangutans and critically endangered @entity8 tigers ( pictured ) and rhinos they found that virtually all of the 153 households - 99 per cent - eat fish found in the jungle at least once a month , while 79 per cent eat bushmeat made up of both mammals and birds			1
nearly half of the households surveyed - 48 per cent - said they eat turtles and tortoises , with 28 per cent feasting on caimans			0
and some of the species being eaten are classed as endangered , vulnerable and threatened			2
@entity18 is second on the list with 114 endangered mammals , with threats particularly facing lemurs and the region 's shrew tenrecs			1
this compares to 38 in @entity130 and 24 in @entity131 there are 105 recognised species of lemur ( ruffed lemur pictured ) , of which 24 are critically endangered , 49 are endangered , 20 are vulnerable and three are near - threatened these include a type of forest pig called the white - lipped peccary , which despite being ‘ near threatened ’ was eaten by 19 per cent of those surveyed			2
the @entity78 has five endangered mammals , but these are almost exclusively marine mammals such as seals and whales that have come under threat from over fishing			1
these include the blue whale , the fin whale , the sei whale and the @entity89 right whale			1
in the @entity152 , there are 35 endangered species including breeds of rats , bats and wolves			2
elsewhere in @entity160 , @entity159 has 16 endangered mammals including the @entity163 lynx ( pictured left ) , while @entity164 has 11 , @entity165 has 17 , @entity158 has 11 and @entity166 has 31			1
this includes the @entity168 ( right ) these include the giant kangaroo rat , the @entity172 myosis bat , the black - footed ferret and the hog deer			0
during the 20th century , the global population of hog deer drastically dropped , with the almost total loss of hog deer from southeast @entity179			0
falling numbers are blamed on heavy hunting in these regions			0
in the @entity152 there are 35 endangered species , compared to @entity185 's 11 , including breeds of rats , bats and wolves			0
these include the giant kangaroo rat , the @entity172 myosis bat , the black - footed ferret and the hog deer during the 20th century the global population of hog deer ( pictured ) drastically dropped , with the almost total loss of hog deer from southeast @entity179			0
falling numbers are blamed on heavy hunting in these regions the black - footed ferret ( left ) is also at risk in @entity196 , as is the @entity198 monk seal ( pictured right ) @entity200 from the @entity21 said : ' this new data is really alarming and suggests we need to do something urgently if we are going to prevent the extinction of these species			0
' the most depressing element is that each of these threats are a direct result of human activity and our impact on the natural world			0
many of our most beautiful species are just silently slipping away , so it is incredibly important to raise awareness and pressure nations to be more responsible			0

maps were created by the @entity229 based on data from the @entity17
@entity1 topped the list with a total of 184 endangered mammals
@entity236 was @entity18 with 114 and third was @entity20 with 101
species include lemurs , @entity241 tigers , blue whale and the red wolf
