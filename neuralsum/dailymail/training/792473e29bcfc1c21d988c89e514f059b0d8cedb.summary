by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 18 july 2012 updated : 01:49 est , 19 july 2012 @entity1 , pictured , advertised filthy rooms as ' newly - refurbished ' but claimed he did n't understand what the phrase meant peeling wallpaper , mouldy bathrooms and tatty floors do n’t sound the most inviting attributes for a seaside hotel			1
so owner @entity1 advertised his @entity11 establishment as being ‘ newly refurbished ’ instead			1
he flaunted a few fake star ratings and tourist board accreditations for good measure			1
but his somewhat imaginative approach to marketing landed him in court after a flood of complaints from visitors about the three hotels he owns in @entity23 , @entity24			1
last week @entity1 was ordered to pay almost £ 12,000 in fines , costs and compensation after admitting 12 charges of unfair trading under consumer protection legislation			1
@entity23 magistrates heard some guests who had booked the @entity11 found themselves shunted off to other accommodation because @entity1 had double - booked their rooms			1
they ended up in his wife ’s bedroom , still filled with her personal belongings , or in lower - graded rooms in other hotels			1
those who got to stay at the @entity11 itself , however , were even unhappier			0
in a litany of complaints on travel websites , they told of filthy rooms , grubby vinyl flooring and mouldy walls			2
@entity1 , 40 , claimed that he did n’t understand what ‘ newly refurbished ’ meant because his first language is @entity51			1
run down : the bathroom in the @entity53 was shabby and the court heard how one guest found her ' newly refurbished ' room at the @entity11 to be ' filthy ' ( pictured right ) another guest at the @entity58 , also owned by @entity1 , said their room was covered in mould , whilst another one dubbed the hotel a ' dated hovel ' and an ' overpriced dive ' @entity66 , prosecuting for @entity68 council , said tourism body @entity69 had revoked the star ratings for @entity1 ’s hotels after a series of complaints , but he refused to remove them from signs outside or on his website			1
he also boasted accreditation from the @entity77 , which has not recognised the hotels for some time			2
at the @entity11 signs indicated it held a two - star aa rating , as well as three stars from the @entity69			1
rooms cost about £ 90			2
@entity1 , who also owns @entity84 and the @entity53 hotels , was told by magistrates that he had degraded the local tourist industry and badly let down his guests			1
they fined him £ 8,400 and ordered him to pay £ 3,000 in costs to @entity68 council			0
he will also have to pay £ 550 compensation to guests who were misled about bookings			2
councillor @entity94 said the council had prosecuted as a last resort after @entity1 ignored warnings			1
@entity97 , @entity1 ’s solicitor , told the @entity98 his client had made significant improvements to the hotels over the past 24 months			1
he added : ‘ mr @entity1 regrets any distress or inconvenience caused to his guests			1
’ of the 60 entries on the @entity106 website , 26 rated @entity1 ’ @entity11 as ' terrible ' .1			2
' @entity107 ' - @entity11 some guests claimed that a staff member at the @entity111 hotel was a ' real - life @entity112 ' , pictured ' breakfast waiter needs a kick up the backside			1
had to ask him twice on both mornings for tea , toast and orange juice			0
then the food took along ( sic ) time to arrive			0
could have killed the pig myself and cooked it quicker			0
' do n’t go there ' - @entity127 room was a hole			2
threadbare carpets , and not the cleanest			0
i will definately ( sic ) be recommending this hotel to my worst enemies			0
' awful ' - @entity135 ‘ receptionist ’ could only be described as @entity112			2
when asked if we could have a television in the room he gave me a key to a top floor room and told me to get it myself ... needless to say i will not be paying a return visit			0
' overpriced dump ' - the @entity144 stayed at @entity145 a year ago for the christening of our granddaughter , but have only just calmed down enough to be able to rationalize our experience			2
' shed central ' - @entity127 most uncomfortable bed i can remember ( trying ) to sleep in			0
we had a freezing cold bathroom			0
toilet and a grubby old bath i ’d only consider to die in , not wash			0
' avoid ! ' - @entity157 where to start ? looks adequate from outside and reception but room was hideous - grubby and too small to swing a hamster , let alone a cat			0
' shocking ‘ hotel ’ ' - the @entity162 was just terrible ! the smell was overwhelming air freshner ( sic ) ! what was it covering up ? the carpet had n’t been vacuumed for days but the bathroom ! ! ! ! ! ! ! @entity170 ! it was filthy ! ' 8			0
' - @entity172 your only other option was to sleep on the street then perhaps risk it			0
' complete dump - will look great when its ( sic ) demolished ' - the @entity162 sizes were terrible - i ’ve slept in bigger one man tents and the hotel had more cracks in it than my crazy paving			0
' argh ! ' - @entity186 , i ignored the bad reviews below ! '			0

@entity1 admitted 12 separate charges of unfair *business* practice after using bogus star ratings and making made - up claims about his hotels in @entity23 , @entity69
@entity195 also heard the *bungling* proprietor *overbooked* rooms on a number of *occasions* and put guests up in his wife *'s* bedroom instead
@entity1 claimed *confusion* about the meaning of ' newly - refurbished ' arose because his first language was @entity51
