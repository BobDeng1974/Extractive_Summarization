by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 13 february 2013 this daring athlete is pictured testing out a new extreme sport - riding mammoth 30ft waves on a pair of water skis			2
@entity6 is believed to be the first person to ever attempt wave skiing and he seems to have perfected the sport already			1
in contrast to water skiing , where you are always towed along by a motorboat , wave skiers are released at the peak of a wave to ski ' freestyle '			1
photographer @entity33 captured these incredible images of @entity6 catching huge waves at an offshore reef near @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28			1
@entity6 , who is already at professional level in orthodox skiing and surfing , even uses ski poles when wave skiing			1
the poles are of no real use in the water except to help him maintain the same balance and positioning as he would when skiing on snow			2
he has also had a pair of custom made skis to use which are a combination of water skis and the skis used on snow			1
the extreme athlete , 43 , who lives in @entity27 , said : ' the unpredictability of the water is what makes wave skiing so difficult			1
' the sport feels similar to skiing on snow in warm temperatures when the snow is soft			0
adrenaline seekers : wave skiers are towed along by a powerboat - similar to water skiing - but are then released at the crest of a wave so they can ski it ' freestyle ' dedicated : photographer @entity33 went to great lengths to secure these astonishing images - taking pictures from helicopters , boats and the shoreline challenging : @entity6 is released by the motorboat at high speeds on to the crest of the wave which he can then ski ' you have got to have knowledge of the ocean and the energy of the water to be able to do it			1
' the feeling when you drop in off a wave is a bit sketchy at first just because you 're going so fast			0
' i do n't think there is anyone else in the world doing it but for me it is just a bit of fun alongside my surfing and snow skiing			0
' i 've tried it without the ski poles and it felt very strange - they help me with balance and keeping my body in the correct position			0
' mr @entity33 also put together a composition of shots to help show how @entity6 catches the waves on a pair of skis			2
the photographer will shoot from a variety of places , including on board a helicopter , on a boat or on the shore , to get the best pictures			0
mr @entity33 , 60 , from @entity27 , said : ' what @entity6 is doing is unique and i do n't know of anyone anywhere who can do this on waves			2
' i think he has invented a new sport and i believe he will ride larger and larger waves on his skis and perfect the technique			0
' it is pretty ridiculous how good he is and i think he is capable of dropping in off waves as big as 50ft tall			0
' i 've been photographing @entity6 for eight years now and you ca n't help but like the guy , he is such a tremendous athlete too			0
' wave skiing is pretty dangerous as you are travelling at such a speed - you have to be a pro surfer as well as pro skier to have the ability to do it			2
' to imagine how difficult it is , i think you would have to compare it to skiing in an avalanche			0
' i really enjoy filming him catching the large waves but i 'm not at all tempted to risk my life doing it ! ' balancing act : @entity6 , who is at a professional level in orthodox skiing , uses ski poles to help him balance daring : @entity6 believes he is the only person in the world to currently be wave skiing			1
