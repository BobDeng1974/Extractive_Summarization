@entity0 is set to have a very close encounter with an asteroid the day after @entity3			1
the asteroid - which goes by the catchy name of 2012 @entity6 - will miss our home planet by just 17,200 miles , which is a very near miss in space terms			1
the asteroid , which is about 150ft across , will come closer to @entity0 than the ring of geosynchronous satellites , which are in orbit about 22,200 miles above the @entity0			1
space rock : although it will come uncomfortably close to the @entity0 , the asteroid will only be visible if you have a good pair of binoculars on june 30 1908 , in a remote part of @entity22 , a fireball was seen streaking across the daytime sky			1
this event – now known as the tunguska event – is believed to have been caused by an incoming meteor which exploded in the atmosphere			2
evenks natives and @entity22 settlers in the hills north - west of @entity28 reported a column of bluish light , nearly as bright as the sun , moving across the sky			1
about 10 minutes later , there was a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire			0
eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported the sound source moving east to north			0
the sounds were accompanied by a shockwave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of miles away			1
the majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors rather than the sighting of the explosion			0
the explosion registered on seismic stations across @entity57			0
in some places the shock wave would have been equivalent to an earthquake of 5.0 on the @entity61			1
it also produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in the @entity65			0
over the next few days , night skies in @entity67 and @entity68 were aglow - and all of this came from a meteorite exploding some four to six miles above the @entity0 's surface			1
says @entity72 , manager of the @entity73 at @entity75 's @entity74 : ' the generally agreed upon theory is that on the morning of june 30 , 1908 , a large space rock , about 120 feet across , entered the atmosphere of @entity79 and then detonated in the sky			1
' although the asteroid is small , if it were on a collision course with @entity0 , it would produce the equivalent of 2.5 megatons of @entity85			1
and this is just one of some 500,000 rocks circling the @entity0			0
the good news is that scientists say that that is n't enough to wipe out life on the planet - but it could wipe out a city the size of @entity95			1
however , a miss is as good as a mile , and unless you 're specifically looking for it , you almost certainly wo n't see the asteroid			2
@entity75 says that it wo n't be bright enough to see with the naked eye , but that a good pair of binoculars or a telescope should be able to pick it out			0
on the 15th , said @entity75 , the asteroid will travel rapidly from the southern evening sky into the northern morning sky , with its closest @entity0 approach occurring about 19:26 utc when it will achieve a magnitude of less than seven , which is somewhat fainter than naked eye visibility			0
about four minutes after its @entity0 close approach , there is a good chance it will pass into the @entity0 's shadow for about 18 minutes or so before reappearing from the eclipse			2
when travelling rapidly into the northern morning sky , 2012 @entity6 will quickly fade in brightness			0
the best view for astronomers will be from @entity120 , says @entity75 , while stargazers in @entity68 , @entity67 and @entity122 should also be able to get a good look at the space rock as it whizzes past us at a speed of 17,400mph			1
the asteroid was discovered only last year , by astronomers in southern @entity129			0
the team was operating from the @entity132 observatory near @entity133 in @entity129			0
the observatory uses automated telescopes to track small asteroids and comets			0
2012 @entity6 was discovered after the astronomers decided to search areas of the sky where asteroids are not usually seen			0
its orbital period around the sun is very close to our own , at 368 days , and it has made a close approach every year			2
this year 's is the closest , say scientists - and the good news is that this is the closest it will get to @entity0 for at least three decades			2
dr @entity148 , a near - earth object observer from the @entity150 's @entity149 ( @entity151 ) office , said : ' in future times the possibility of a collision can not be completely excluded			2
it is highly unlikely , but the chance is greater than zero			0
' the asteroid 's next very close shave with @entity0 will be in 2046 , when it will squeak by us at a distance of 37,000 miles			1
and there 's another close encounter in 97 years ' time , on february 16 2110 , when the chance that it will hit the @entity0 is 1 in 7,692,308,000			2
near miss : the asteroid will pass closer to @entity0 than the ring of satellites above the planet			1

space rock 150ft across set to whizz by just after @entity3
it will miss our home planet by just 17,200 miles - close in *cosmic* terms
an impact would be equivalent to 2.25 megaton atom bomb
