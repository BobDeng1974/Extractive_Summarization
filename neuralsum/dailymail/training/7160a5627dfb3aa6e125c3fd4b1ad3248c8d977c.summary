from 1 april , charges will go up from £ 7.85 to £ 8.05 , and they will rise again to £ 8.20 the following year			0
@entity4 remains the only country in the @entity8 where patients still pay for prescriptions , which are free in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
patients in @entity4 will have to pay 20p more for their prescriptions starting next month , ministers have announced the government said the increase was necessary to meet the growing demands on the @entity18 - its spending on drugs has more than doubled since 2000 but charities say the charges unfairly tax sick patients - particularly those with long - term conditions such as asthma , multiple sclerosis , diabetes and migraines who are on several drugs			1
and senior pharmacists say some patients are having to choose between paying for drugs to alleviate pain or buying food and keeping their homes warm			2
they are also routinely being asked by frail patients whether there are any drugs they could possibly to without as they are unable to afford all those their gp has prescribed			0
announcing the increase yesterday , health minister @entity44 said : ‘ this government has made tough decisions to protect the @entity18 budget and increase it in real terms , but charges for some items remain an important source of revenue to support the delivery of high quality @entity18 services			1
‘ this is particularly important given the increasing demands on the @entity18 , with spending on medicines alone almost doubling since 2000			1
’ but @entity61 , spokesperson from @entity62 said : ‘ prescription charges have risen for 34 of the past 35 years			0
‘ many have to choose between paying for their medicine or household bills such as food and heating			0
they face medicines poverty because they have a lifelong illness they do n’t want			0
’ @entity4 remains the only country in the @entity8 where patients still pay for prescriptions last week research carried out by the @entity75 - which represents 30 health charities - found that a third of patients had stopped taking drugs because they were too expensive			1
the organisation - which surveyed 5,000 patients with long term conditions - also found that three quarters had to take time off work			0
@entity86 , chief executive of @entity87 ’s and @entity8 , one of the charities represented by the organisation said : ‘ these findings tell a heartbreaking story of people facing medicine - poverty because of the spiralling cost of their essential drugs			2
‘ many are risking their health , and their ability to work , by having to make the impossible decision between taking their much - needed medicines to enable them to remain in employment , or putting food on the table for their families			0
@entity4 is now the only country in the @entity8 still making patients pay for prescriptions as there were abolished in @entity11 in 2011 in @entity12 in 2007 and in @entity13 2010			1
it means that @entity4 patients are effectively subsiding free drugs for those living elsewhere in the @entity8			1
but recent concerns over poor hospital care in @entity12 - in particular long waiting times - have been linked to the abolition of prescription charges			2
a number of hospitals have high death rates and patients are waiting far longer for tests to diagnose cancer as well as in @entity125			0
experts have said prescription charges are necessary to fund a high standard of @entity18 care .			2

@entity4 remains only country in @entity8 where patients pay for prescriptions
they are currently free in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13
government said increase ' necessary to meet growing demands on @entity18 '
