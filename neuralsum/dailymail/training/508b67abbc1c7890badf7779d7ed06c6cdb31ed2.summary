by @entity0 published : 09:26 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 16:47 est , 10 june 2013 @entity1 will not head to @entity2 if her @entity4 talkshow ends , sources confirmed today			1
as @entity8 revealed last week , the @entity7 co-anchor , 56 , has other future projects in mind - fuelling speculation that her daytime programme will not return for a third season next year			0
amid reports that she will join old friend and former ' @entity1 ' executive producer @entity17 at his network @entity2 , a source said today @entity1 's special correspondent deal with @entity20 would preclude her from joining the cable network for the ' forseeable future ' interestingly , the source added : ' @entity17 has been making progress at @entity2 and @entity1 is not the distraction that he 's looking for			1
out of a job ? new reports allege that @entity1 's talk show will not be renewed for a third season ' @entity17 and @entity1 are not attached at the hip , they each have their focus on their jobs at hand			1
' the pair worked together on the today show and the source added : ' they 're in no rush to be reunited			2
it took them six years to reunite on a project the last time and no - one should assume it will be any quicker this time			1
' @entity1 is still filming episodes of the first season of her show and will launch a second season in september with new executive producer @entity48 on board			0
it was reported at the weekend that the buzz inside @entity4 is that @entity1 could leave the show after the second season and head to @entity2 to join @entity17			1
' the show was oversold at syndication and has n’t lived up to expectations , ' one source told the @entity57			0
lady who lunches : @entity1 attended the women taking the lead luncheon by @entity61 at @entity62 on monday in @entity63 ' now everyone at @entity4 is gossiping that @entity1 will end up at @entity2 with @entity17			1
' the blonde mother - of - two is a special correspondent with @entity20 , which was a key component of her deal when she signed up for her syndicated show			1
and this would preclude her from moving to @entity2 for the ' forseeable future '			0
this element of the deal is longer than her talkshow deal , which was signed for two years only			2
last week , a friend admitted it was ' too early to tell ' if @entity1 would be back for a third season as ' there are so many different factors that make a third season discussion premature			0
' recognisable faces : @entity1 , @entity81 and @entity82 joined her at the event the future of the her talkshow will be made in six months , according to the tv source , who added : ‘ there have been issues with leadership and there has been a turnover in staff as we head into the second year			1
‘ it ’s natural when people are going to lose their jobs that they try to complain , but there are a lot of sour grapes			0
‘ but the reality is that there was always going to be a second year and anyone who suggests otherwise is wrong			0
’ the friend added : ‘ there is a lot that @entity1 wants to do in the future , but at the moment she is concentrating on the talk show			0
’ finding her audience : the transition from hard news woman to daytime ' queen ' , seen here with @entity117 pop band @entity118 , was a harder one than expected @entity120 reported an unidentified @entity4 source who claimed that @entity1 ’s eponymous talk show will be cancelled after this first season ends			2
the report cited sources who say that her show is an ' unmitigated disaster ' for a number of reasons , including her elitist approach to guest selection , her revolving door of executive producers , and her reported determination to make the light afternoon talk show a hard - hitting news program , all of which is denied			0
when @entity1 moved to @entity4 following her stint as the first female solo news anchor of a nightly news program at @entity142 , she was hailed as being the inevitable replacement for @entity144 , the long - reigning queen of daytime who had just stepped down from her show			2
finding a mix : @entity1 has reportedly clashed with staff over her desire to skip typical daytime talkshow segments ( like one on former child stars , seen here with a @entity154 alum in june ) for more news coverage she launched the show with longtime pal @entity17 on board as her executive producer , he then left to head up @entity2			1
@entity159 came on board in january and will now be replaced by old hand @entity48 , who previously served as executive producer on the @entity163 , garnering two @entity164 for outstanding @entity165 , the same category @entity1 landed its first emmy nomination in this year			0
the move comes a month after original @entity1 co-executive producer @entity169 followed his former boss @entity17 to @entity2			1
( he was replaced by @entity171 , with producer @entity172 also getting a bump to serve as co-exec producer alongside @entity175			0
) after a strong opening , @entity1 has slipped in the ratings – and is now running neck and neck with @entity180 , which is managing to narrowly beat the show in the key women 25 - 54 demographic			2
this new report comes just days after she revealed that she approached about rejoining her former co-anchor @entity186 on the @entity187 amid their ratings battle with @entity189			0
back in the day : @entity1 originally signed on to the daytime talk show with @entity17 ( right ) , who used to be the executive producer on @entity187 when she hosted with @entity186 ( seen left in 1998 )			1

talkshow host 's @entity20 deal precludes her from joining @entity2
source says : ' it took @entity17 and @entity1 six years to reunite on a project - no - one should assume it will be any quicker this time around *...* they 're not joined at the hip '
