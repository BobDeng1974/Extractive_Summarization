@entity0 would look radically different today if one very big thinking engineer had his way back in 1912			0
in a @entity5 article from that year , dr. @entity3 proposed , among other big changes , the complete filling - in of the @entity8 , the extension of @entity10 by ten blocks to the south and several new plots of land including an island in @entity16			2
for decades , @entity3 extolled the virtues of his plan , which he called ' a really greater @entity16			2
' among those virtues , he said , was room for 20 million @entity0 -- or over four times the population in 1912 -- and a considerable 1,400 acres of land that @entity3 claimed would have a worth of $ 1 billion			1
' a really greater @entity16 ' : a 1912 proposal by engineer @entity3 would have added 1,400 acres to @entity0 by filling in the @entity8 , extending @entity10 over ten blocks to the south , adding new tracts of land and an island off @entity30 and adding land to @entity31 , @entity32 , among other changes ' at first glance , ' @entity3 wrote in a 1916 @entity36 article , ' a project to reclaim fifty square miles of land from @entity16 bay , to add one hundred miles of new waterfront docks , to fill in the @entity8 , and to prepare @entity16 for a population of twenty million , seems somewhat stupendous , does it not ? ' despite his salesman - like panache , @entity3 was actually a well - respected civil engineer of his day			1
according to @entity46 , @entity3 had been involved in the construction of over 20 early @entity0 skyscrapers and many of its bridges			0
but more than just a southerly extension of the island of @entity10 , filling in the @entity8 would remove the only delineation between @entity10 and @entity54 -- which would have grown the island several times over			0
however , the borough of @entity54 would remain			0
not satisfied with simply removing a river , @entity3 proposed a new @entity8 that would run straight through the middle of of @entity54			0
to the west would be mega-manhattan with its ten new blocks extending nearly all the way to @entity30 and encompassing @entity63 , which still today sits to the south of the island			0
disappearing islands : present day @entity63 would have been engulfed by @entity3 's plan to extend @entity10 southward nearly all the way to @entity30 governor 's @entity30 today is a popular destination for warm weather leisure activities , though it remains accessible only by boat or ferry @entity3 fought for decades to get his plan recognized as a viable future for @entity16			1
he even pared it down to a more modest proposal by 1930 , but it never caught on and the borders of the city remain nearly the same today as they were in @entity3 's day to the east of @entity30 , a new island and two new tracts of land would create what the map calls a ' new entry point ' to the city along with a new harbor			1
@entity32 also factored into @entity3 's plan , which would have extended the city of @entity31 far deeper into the @entity90 toward @entity10			1
' this will mean an addition of one hundred miles of new water - front			0
@entity16 's @entity95 would become the center of a really greater @entity16 , having a radius of twenty - five miles , and within that circle there would be ample room for a population of twenty - five millions , the entire project to be carried out within a few years , ' @entity3 wrote			2
while he admitted that his plan would cost even more than another massive engineering feat of the day -- the @entity103 -- @entity3 believed the economic benefits would almost immediately refill the city 's coffers			1
sadly for @entity107 , his plan never caught on enough to come to fruition -- even by 1930 , when he 'd reduced his grand vision from ' @entity109 ' to a smaller scale plan he dubbed more modestly ' @entity10			0
' even bigger than present day : @entity3 hoped to add to @entity16 land worth some $ 1 billion and enough space quadruple its population to 20 to 25 million			1

the 1912 plan first appeared in a @entity5 proposal penned by *mainstream* engineer @entity3
serious *interest* kept the plan *floating* around for decades as @entity107 *touted* the benefits of his ' stupendous ' plan
purported benefits of @entity107 's plan included total space in the city for 20 million -- over twice its *current* population -- and 100 miles of waterfront
