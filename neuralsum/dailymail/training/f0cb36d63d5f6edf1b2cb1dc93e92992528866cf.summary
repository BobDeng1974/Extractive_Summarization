@entity0 failed to get a single shot on target in the league for the first time since the beginning of the 2003/04 season			1
on the same day that @entity9 scored twice for a @entity10 , his club were reminded just how much they need the striker available for the first team as they failed to register a single shot on target in a tame goalless draw against @entity16			2
on a frustrating evening for the visitors @entity18 was grabbed by the throat and pushed to the ground by @entity21 , only for the defender to be given a yellow card			1
' i grabbed @entity18 's face because he called me a " son of a b * * * * ' , " he claimed to reporters after the match			2
@entity0 superstar @entity18 was well marshalled by @entity16 's resolute defensive unit referee @entity33 gave @entity21 a yellow card after he grabbed @entity18 's cheeks @entity21 strangles @entity18 and pushes him away late in the second half sparking protests a close up on @entity21 and @entity18 during the incident on wednesday night a supporter pushes @entity18 away after the frustrating game for the @entity43 forward @entity16 our toughest test - @entity44 @entity16 : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity21 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 ( @entity53 77 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 67 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 85 ) , @entity58			1

referee : @entity33 attendance : 24,821 @entity44 's side had to wait 15 minutes for their first real chance when @entity18 went close with a free - kick that sailed just over @entity88 's bar			1
' we tried to play our usual game but they were very tight defensively and we could find not way through , ' said @entity72 after a game in which @entity0 failed to trouble @entity16 keeper @entity88			1
a minute later @entity94 crossed for @entity73 to shoot just wide			0
@entity16 were comfortable however and it was no surprise when the two teams went down the tunnel at half time still goalless			2
@entity18 had dropped deeper in the first half and just before the break he shuffled past three players before playing the ball out wide to @entity94 , but then failed to get on the end of @entity69 's over-hit cross			1
@entity0 's threat seemed to be coming only down the left as debutant @entity65 played things far too safe down down the right			2
playing instead of the rested @entity108 he did not put a foot wrong defensively but so much more is asked of a @entity0 full - back and he was not offering it in the a very conservative first 45 minutes			0
@entity0 laboured at the start of the second half with @entity75 getting on the end of a @entity70 cross but @entity16 still coping well with the opposition 's limited threat			1
a clumsy jump from @entity65 on @entity58 had the referee pondering a penalty but @entity0 were given the benefit of the doubt			0
as his team continued to toil in vain @entity44 made his first changes on the hour taking off the disappointing @entity75 and the equally ineffective @entity73			0
@entity16 's @entity21 could have been sent off after pushing @entity18 to the ground @entity72 captained @entity0 to a point against @entity16 at the @entity127 @entity75 , pictured with @entity16 's @entity48 , was unable to get himself on the scoresheet @entity129 forward @entity73 started in a three - pronged attack with @entity18 and @entity75 summer signing @entity70 looks frustrutated during his new side 's encounter with @entity16 he is a 35 - year - old rugged , no - nonsense central defender from @entity136 @entity21 only started his professional career at the age of 23 he played in his home country and @entity140 before moving to @entity16 in 2007 on loan and signing permanently a year later during pre-season in 2013 he was injured in a collision with @entity144 @entity145 and @entity18 have previous - in 2009 @entity21 stamped on the @entity43 star 's ankle off the ball @entity74 and @entity76 were the changes and the former immediately got to the byline and forced a corner			1
but at the other end @entity47 flashed a shot just past @entity64 's far post as @entity16 grew in confidence with @entity156 loanee @entity55 on against his former club and forcing a free - kick from another poor @entity65 challenge			2
he took the kick and forced a fine save from @entity64 at his near post			0
finally on 72 minutes @entity65 was replaced by @entity66			0
@entity68 connected with a @entity70 corner but with his shoulder instead of his head and @entity88 made the save â€“ it seemed to sum up @entity0 's night			0
@entity18 was pushed to the ground by @entity21 and should have been sent off for what was a hand to the @entity0 's @entity170 's throat and then face , but the referee showed only a yellow and @entity173 so nearly stole all the points at the end for the home side			1
the duo have history together , with the defender previously caught stamping on the star forward			0
