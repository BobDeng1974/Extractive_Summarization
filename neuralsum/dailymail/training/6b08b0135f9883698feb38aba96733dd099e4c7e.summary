a proud homeowner was left terrified after taking a photo of her new house only to notice a ghost staring out from the window			2
@entity5 , 30 , had gone outside to take a picture of her new home in @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , to share with friends on her @entity13 page			1
but it was only when she took another look at the image that she noticed the spooky apparition of a man peering out her window			1
@entity5 was taking a picture of her new home when she noticed a man 's face in the window the mother - of - one , who was at home with her two - year - old daughter , ran inside to discover that no one was there			1
@entity30 , who moved into the house last month , believes the sighting could be the spirit of @entity34 - a former factory inspector who worked in the area			1
she said : ' i decided to take a picture of the front of our house and post it on @entity13 to show how well we were all settling in			2
' i went outside and took a picture but after initially admiring the brickwork the face just sort of jumped out at me			0
@entity30 believes the apparition was spirit of factory inspector @entity34 who died in 1872 ' i ran into the house to make sure no one was in there because i knew everyone else was at work , but it was just me and my two - year - old daughter			1
' i studied the photo for a while and then put it on @entity13 to see if anyone else could come up with an explanation as to how the face could have got there			0
' @entity30 , a mobile phone case designer , added : ' the photo caused quite a stir on @entity13 , but no one could really come up with any plausible explanation			2
' most people thought it was a reflection of the flowers below the window but the angles are all wrong			0
' ' it 's hard to believe but it clearly looks like the face of an old man			0
' she denies claims the image has been doctored and after witnessing a number of ghostly goings on - including a clock falling off a wall - believes the house is haunted			1
' i 'm a self - confessed non-believer of ghosts but the picture coupled with a clock randomly falling off the wall and smashing to pieces that morning did creep me out , ' she said			1
' the clock was there when we moved in , so it had n't fallen off due to a dodgy fixture we had put up			0
' another weird thing was that my friend saw a door handle move down and the door opened in the same room the face in the window was in			0
' i was just so surprised because i thought someone was in the house			0
we also checked the attic to make sure no one was living up there			0
@entity30 moved into the house in @entity9 , @entity10 , last month and had wanted to share pictures of her new home with friends on @entity13 when she discovered the chilling image the room where the spirit was peering out the window when @entity30 went outside to take a picture ' i ca n't really say what i think the face in the window is as i honestly do n't know			1
' i would like to say an odd reflection but it does n't make sense , i am a very logical person but i can not come up with a logical explanation for this photo , it 's just spooky			0
' and to be honest , i would rather not think about it as we already hear strange scratches in the walls , noises from upstairs and the lights flicker on and off to			0
@entity5 with her two - year - old daughter who was at home when she spotted the ' ghost ' ' you end up scaring yourself if you think about it too much			1
' local historian @entity131 , 50 , has done extensive research into @entity34 , the father of @entity133 , who brutally murdered her three - year - old brother when she was 16 in the nearby village of @entity136 in 1860			1
he thinks the photograph of the shadowy ghoul , dubbed @entity139 , bears a striking resemblance to @entity34 , who died in 1872			2
mr @entity131 , who is a caretaker at @entity141 in @entity9 , said : ' from looking at the photograph , to me it looks like @entity34 , father of @entity133 , who committed an infamous murder in the area			2
' there are a number of reported ghost sightings in @entity9 but i have not come across any in @entity8			0
' i know @entity34 lived and worked as a factory inspector in the area , so there 's every chance it could be him			2
' mr @entity34 was originally a suspect in the 1860 @entity155 murder , but his daughter , @entity156 , was arrested and eventually convicted of murdering his three - year - old son			1
the @entity155 murder case found fame again in recent years thanks to @entity162 's award - winning book @entity163			0
the sighting comes after a spate of reports that ghosts have been popping up in photographs across the nation , most recently at @entity170 in the @entity171 , where a black - eyed ghost child was caught on camera			0
some of the legal documents that came with the house , which she now believes is haunted after a series of spooky goings on , including a clock falling off the wall and a door handle moving			1
