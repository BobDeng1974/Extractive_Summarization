a mother who woke up from a coma had lost more than a decade of her memory and thought it was still the 1990s			1
@entity4 had been in a coma for six weeks following a car accident , when she woke up believing she was a 22 - year - old woman			1
in fact she was 40 and was told she was mother to @entity10 , then 14			1
' they told me i had a daughter and i just stared at them and said , ' what ? '' ms @entity16 explained			1
in fact it was 2010 , she was 40 and mother to @entity10 ( right ) , who she did n't recognise the former model was convinced it was still the 1990s - the decade when the @entity20 were top of the charts with @entity28 and @entity29 was the latest health crisis to hit @entity32			1
she said it was incredibly hard dealing with the fact she only had a fleeting image of her daughter at two and could remember nothing of her growing up , let alone recognise the girl standing before her in hospital			1
ms @entity16 , a former model , lost control of her @entity41 and crashed into the path of an ambulance near @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 in september 2010			1
this was not far from her home in @entity49			1
she was rescued by firefighters who spent an hour cutting her free from the wreckage and saved her life			1
while she was in the coma her family discussed turning off her life support at @entity56 , but , at the last minute , she was able to move a finger , signalling for them to give her more time			1
after she woke up ms @entity16 had difficulty adjusting to her memory loss			1
ms @entity16 woke up from the six week coma thinking she was still 22 ( left ) but discovered she was 40 ms @entity16 is pictured with her daughter @entity10 but failed to recognise the then 14 - year - old in 2010 ms @entity16 is building her relationship with @entity10 despite being unable to remember her growing up the former model 's family considered turning off her life support in hospital but she then started to move ' shock does n't even come close to what i felt , ' she said			1
' they told me i had a daughter and i just stared at them and said , ' what ? '' eventually one image of @entity10 , who was 14 at the time , came back to me , but she was a tiny little girl of about two			1
' when she came to the hospital i had no idea who she was , i just could n't believe i had a teenage daughter			1
memory loss after a head injury , such as that ms @entity16 suffered , is incredibly common and is always unique to the person			1
@entity90 , from brain injury charity @entity88 , said : ' memory is not one ' thing ' or one skill on its own			0
it is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures within the brain that are involved in processing information , storing it and retrieving it			0
' mr @entity90 said memory loss often occurs after a brain injury			0
when people forget information forgotten before the injury this is known as retrograde amnesia			0
memory loss usually ranges from a few minutes to a few months			0
' however , memory loss after brain injury can be unpredictable and some people may experience more extreme symptoms , particularly with more severe injuries , ' he added			0
' every brain injury is unique and there 's no ' one size fits all ' approach to rehabilitation			0
' ' i still have no memories of her before the crash , and it has been hard			2
' ms @entity16 , of @entity126 , @entity49 had also completely forgotten she had a boyfriend of six years who had come to see her every day while she 'd been in hospital			1
the pair split up shortly after the accident			0
she added ' i thought i was about 22 , i still can not remember my childhood , going to school or my oldest friends			1
' ms @entity16 has now met the firefighters at @entity136 , @entity45			1
the crew spent over an hour cutting her free from the wreckage of her car , and saving her life four years ago			1
when she walked into the station she recognised three members of the crew , only to be told that they were the people who rescued her			2
she said : ' this whole time i believed i had been alone that night without any real human contact but it all came flooding back to me when i saw their faces			0
' ms @entity16 said it had been a huge comfort to learn she had not been alone after the crash			1
she said : ' i wanted to meet the firefighters who came to my rescue that night			2
i wanted to say a huge thank you , i owe them my life			2
' watch manager @entity157 , the @entity159 officer in charge at the incident , said : ' we vividly remember this crash			0
ms @entity16 thought she was still a 22 - year - old woman when she woke up and forgot a decade of memories it took firefighters more than an hour to cut the former model free from the wreckage of her car after the crash ms @entity16 has made a full physical recovery and is driving again , but can only remember life at 22 ' as we removed the roof of the car to gain access to @entity16 , crew members sat inside and talked to her throughout the rescue			1

in the 1990s mad cow disease became the latest health scare			2
the disease in cattle , known as @entity29 , had been around for decades but scientists made a link between this strain and a similar version of the disease in humans known as @entity232			0

in fashion the 90s were the era when wearing sportswear , whatever the occasion , became the desired look			0
@entity263 trousers , @entity265 jackets and @entity267 trainers were high in the fashion stakes , along with caps and mood rings - designed to change colour to show if wearers were feeling a range of emotions from happy , stressed and jealous			0
