@entity0 piled on the agony for @entity2 as the luckless @entity3 lost their star full - back as well as their 100 per cent @entity6 record on friday the 13th			1
the @entity7 left out @entity9 international @entity8 after it emerged that he was the subject of a police investigation into an assault case , forcing @entity2 to throw teenager @entity14 in for his full debut			1
@entity14 performed admirably but little else went right for @entity2 as they fell from the top of the table and suffered a fifth consecutive defeat at the @entity19 in going down 18 - 6 to a @entity0 side starting to find their groove			1
@entity23 touches down over the line to score a magnificent solo try and get @entity0 on their way the @entity7 trailed 18 - 0 until scoring what proved to be a consolation try through winger @entity29 and skipper @entity31 's goal took him to within three points of the 4,000 mark			1
the @entity34 , led by the magnificent @entity35 in the absence of the injured @entity37 , created the first chance when lively left winger @entity39 produced a half - break but centre @entity40 was pulled back for a forward pass			0
both sides were full of attacking intent but they virtually cancelled each other out and it took a moment of brilliance from right winger @entity23 to break the deadlock on 15 minutes			0
@entity50 was forced to drop back to collect @entity52 's wayward pass but that succeeded in fooling the @entity2 defence which was back - pedalling when the one - time basketball player cut a swathe through the middle for an opportunist score			2
@entity59 stops @entity2 ' @entity60 in a game where excellent defenses trumped ambitious attacks the @entity7 lost centre @entity64 with concussion at that point but second rower @entity68 has plenty of experience in the threequarters and he demonstrated his nous on 25 minutes to create a clear - cut opening for winger @entity75 , who uncharacteristically fumbled the pass			0
the @entity34 then struck another blow seven minutes before the break when @entity52 raced onto a perfectly - judged grubber kick from scrum - half @entity80			0
@entity52 kicked his second goal to make it 12 - 0 and @entity0 defended superbly to keep their lead intact up to the break , with @entity2 duo @entity86 and @entity87 held agonisingly short of the line			1
@entity2 recovered a 12 - point interval deficit to win handsomely in their last match but any hopes of a repeat were dashed by an unlikely error from their inspirational captain			0
@entity52 dives on the ball to score his side 's second try , awarded after a decision from the @entity99 @entity80 swooped on a stray pass from the @entity7 stand - off 30 metres out from the visitors ' line to get @entity40 over for a third try and @entity52 kicked his third goal			2
@entity2 grabbed a lifeline on the hour when @entity75 broke clear on halfway and centre @entity60 was in support to get @entity29 away and they thought they had scored again moments later when @entity86 touched down after @entity52 had fumbled @entity31 's high kick but the try was ruled out for a knock - on by @entity111			1
@entity31 went off injured 11 minutes from the end as @entity0 comfortably held on for a precious victory despite @entity52 missing with a penalty kick at goal and @entity116 putting a drop - goal attempt wide			2
@entity31 lines up his goal after @entity2 ' only try , but it failed to spark a late comeback			0

@entity23 scores brilliant solo try to put @entity0 in front
@entity52 crosses for second try , @entity40 adds third
@entity2 can only *respond* with @entity29 consolation try
@entity2 handed teenager @entity14 debut in absence of @entity8
