by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 11:07 est , 22 november 2013 a catering company makes a staggering 500 mile round trip every day of the school year to deliver lunches to pupils , it has been revealed			1
meals for more than 100 schools in @entity9 are prepared 230 miles away in @entity10 before they 're transported in refrigerated lorries across the country - a journey that takes up to four hours			1
parents have branded the trip ' ludicrous ' as it emerged the vehicles clock up a staggering 1,000 miles per week transporting food			1
' ludicrous ' : the meals for @entity9 are produced in @entity10 and driven 230 miles to various schools			1
each trip costs at least £ 80 in fuel it has been estimated			0
the council said the deal was ' value for money ' the company , @entity25 , supplies 118 schools in @entity9 with 5,140 meals a day at a cost of up to £ 2.02 per lunch , which it says includes fuel and transportation costs			1
it costs an average small car more than £ 80 in petrol to do one return journey between @entity10 and @entity9			2
over five days this amounts to more than £ 400 or £ 12,000 per school year			0
in a large refrigerated lorry the cost is likely to be considerably more			0
parent groups have have raised concerns about how fresh the food is when t arrives in schools as well as the carbon footprint caused by the lengthy journeys			0
@entity45 , spokeswomen for campaign group @entity46 , said : ' it takes at least four hours to do this journey , that ’s a long way for food to travel			0
' it just seems ludicrous when there are @entity9 companies who are able to make excellent school meals that are locally sourced and home cooked			1
long journey : the meals , provided by @entity25 ( pictured here in @entity10 ) have to travel hundreds of miles in refrigerated lorries before they arrive on children 's plates			1
meals include lasagne and fish fingers ' i ’m not saying this company is not a good one , but a huge amount of fuel is being used and it makes you wonder if the food can be as fresh as if it were prepared locally			2
' it ’s so important children get a decent , nutritious meal at lunchtime			0
' i think parents will think this is ridiculous and i think we need to be asking questions about why we in @entity9 , as a rural farming county , are not using local companies			2
' @entity83 signed a £ 1.2million a year contract with @entity25 based in @entity85 , @entity10 , in 2007 , because it was a ‘ value for money service ’			1
the factory prepare the meals on site and it is thought they are then chilled so they can be reheated at schools in areas including @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
meals include southern fried chicken pizza , fish fingers , sausage and mash and lasagne			0
some schools have chosen to opt out of the service and are paying an extra eight pence per meal to have it sourced and cooked locally			2
one school is @entity106 , a @entity108 primary school in @entity92 , which has meals delivered from a nearby college for £ 2.10 each			2
opt out : @entity106 , a @entity108 primary school in @entity92 , has decided to provide its own locally - sourced meals at a cost of 8p extra @entity113 , a governor at the school , said : ' for some children the meal they get at lunchtime is the best they will get all day			1
' that is a sad fact , and makes it our responsibility to see that what they get in the best we can achieve , and that means good , local food			0
' @entity127 , cabinet member for education at @entity83 , said : ' to provide a great value for money service we used a tendering process for the contract			2
' @entity25 were awarded the contract in 2007 because there was not the capacity locally			0
' we did have reservations about the distance the food was being transported			0
' also , @entity140 , a food supplier based in @entity142 , has supplied a number of schools with locally sourced meals			1
' mrs @entity127 said the contract with @entity25 is due to run out next july and the council will look to find a more local supplier			0
a spokesman for @entity25 said : ' we have an expert team that ensures our distribution network is as efficient as possible , helping us reduce road miles and provide a high - quality delivery service to schools across the country			1

more than 100 schools in @entity9 have their meals prepared 230 miles away
