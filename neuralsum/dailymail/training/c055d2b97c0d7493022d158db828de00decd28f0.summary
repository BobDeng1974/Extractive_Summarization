pope @entity0 called on the church to adapt to ' changing conditions of society ' yesterday following a conference that rejected changes that would have softened the church 's stance toward homosexuality and divorce			1
as he beatified pope @entity10 who implemented the @entity13 's vast changes , @entity0 said ' @entity14 is not afraid of new things '			1
liberal reforms to church doctrine which fell short of the two thirds majority needed for success in the meeting would also have opened the way for @entity23 who are divorced and remarried to receive communion , the central sacrament of the church			2
@entity0 ( pictured yesterday at the @entity27 ) spoke of the failings of opposing wings of the @entity30 following the end of the @entity33 synod on family life which left supporters of gay rights and divorcees disappointed traditionalists , the @entity10 said , risk a temptation of ' hostile inflexibility '			1
it is unclear whether the document issued saturday is a set - back for the pope , but the conference did prompt the church to discuss difficult issues such as the role of gays , lesbians and divorced @entity23			1
commentators said the bishops had done what @entity0 had asked of them , which was to talk about the issues in an ' open way '			0
but those talks , to ' take the bishop 's pulse ' on current issues , had exposed a split reformers and conservatives			0
an interim document issued last week by the bishops halfway through their synod included wording that welcomed the ' gifts and qualities ' of gay @entity23 and called on pastors to ' avoid any language or behavior ' that could discriminate against divorced @entity23 , @entity63 reported			2
saturday 's report did not feature the reconciliatory language			0
the final paper also emphasised strongly that there was no change in the church 's attitude to gay relationships			2
@entity81 : the attempt at liberal reform of the church 's teachings are part of @entity0 's attempt to steer the @entity27 towards new thinking on gay rights and doctrine on marriage and the family ' no grounds whatsoever exist for assimilating or drawing analogies , however remote , between homosexual unions and @entity14 's design for matrimony and the family , ' it said			0
divorced and remarried @entity23 were denied hopes of a reform that would approve their taking communion without any annulment of their first marriage			0
the synod said ' greater theological study ' and ' further consideration ' were required			0
the church does not recognise divorce so remarried @entity23 are regarded as adulterers			1
some experts compared pope @entity0 ' efforts to modernise the church 's postion , with @entity10 's implementation of the @entity13 , which dramatically modernized the church in the 1960s and 1970s			1
sunday 's ceremony leaves @entity10 , who was pope from 1963 until his death in 1978 , just one step short of sainthood			1
@entity124 @entity123 and @entity10 , who came before and after @entity10 , respectively , were made saints six months ago			2
also attending the beatification @entity126 was @entity127			0
gathering : priests attend a mass in @entity81 at the @entity27 yesterday			0
traditionalists , the @entity10 said , risk a temptation of ' hostile inflexibility ' since @entity0 became anointed last year , he has repeatedly broken with tradition			1
while the bishops failed to build on the tone he set last year by saying , ' who am i to judge ? ' when asked whether gays can be good @entity141 , observers applauded the openness of addressing the contentious issues			0
a year - long debate and discussions will now before the bishops will reconvene for another three - week synod			1
a document on pastoral guidelines will then be formalised			0
commentators believe @entity0 will spend the next year making his case with bishops , but they believe the outcome could simply lead to the gap between church leaders widening .			2

@entity10 calls for the church to adapt to ' changing conditions of society '
as plans to soften stance on homosexuality and divorce are rejected
a year long debate and discussions will now begin to finalise the document
