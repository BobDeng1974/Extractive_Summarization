by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 20 october 2012 updated : 04:29 est , 15 august 2013 detectives investigating illegal payments to police officers for inside information are demanding that a private detective agency hand over its list of paid confidential sources			1
the list is held offshore and belongs to @entity10 , a @entity11 - based agency under investigation for allegedly bribing @entity14 officers on behalf of wealthy clients			1
it is believed the list may contain the identity of scores of corrupt officers and government officials			1
probe : @entity14 officers are demanding to see the list containing the identity of corrupt officers and @entity25 officials evidence of a confidential source payment system was discovered among computer files and documents recently seized from @entity10 ’s office by the @entity14 ’s anti-corruption squad			1
one invoice suggests that @entity34 , a management company in @entity35 , is paid to keep the list of confidential sources secure			1
the discovery is a significant breakthrough in the @entity14 ’s year - long corruption probe			1
when @entity42 learned about the list two weeks ago , detectives urged us to delay publication of the report while it carried out an operation last week			1
the @entity14 refuses to say what steps it took , but a spokesman confirmed last night that detectives would force disclosure of the list through the courts unless @entity10 handed it over voluntarily			1
the @entity42 has spoken to former @entity10 insiders who described how the ‘ source payment system ’ worked			1
cash from a well - known bureau de change is couriered to @entity10 ’s office and passed to a small group of senior executives who run and pay confidential sources			1
each source has a codename , for example @entity65 , but only a few @entity10 executives know their real identity , which is recorded on the list			1
the system was set up six years ago			2
it followed concerns expressed in an internal memo seen by this newspaper that @entity10 needed a way of dealing with the ‘ time bomb ’ of large cash payments to unidentified sources in the event of an official investigation into its affairs			2
' plot ' : the @entity42 report in june that named @entity10 management for allegedly bribing @entity14 officers anti-corruption detectives are examining allegations that two @entity10 executives bribed officers on an anti-money - laundering unit ( @entity90 ) for information about the case they were building against their @entity94 client , @entity95 , a former state governor , and his @entity98 solicitor @entity97			1
@entity10 invoices were sent anonymously to the @entity14 and police watchdog last year			2
the invoices purportedly detailed £ 20,000 of payments between 2007 and 2008 to the @entity90 detectives and other ‘ confidential sources ’ associated with the @entity95 prosecution			2
in may , @entity10 chief executive @entity106 and former managing director @entity107 were arrested on suspicion of bribing @entity90 detective constable @entity108			2
@entity95 , a former state governor had a case built against him @entity106 and @entity107 are former @entity14 detectives			2
@entity107 trained @entity108 in anti-money - laundering techniques before he left the force in 2003			2
@entity108 was also arrested and placed on restricted duties			2
all three men deny the allegations			0
the @entity116 has since advised there should be no further action concerning @entity119 and he has returned to full duties			0
@entity10 maintains that @entity97 fabricated the invoices to assist an appeal against the seven - year sentence he received in 2011 for money - laundering			0
@entity95 pleaded guilty earlier this year and was jailed for 13 years			0
however , @entity42 has learned of another significant discovery among @entity10 ’s seized files that suggests the invoices are genuine			0
it is an internal @entity10 email dated august 5 , 2008 , and titled ‘ @entity129 ’			0
attached to the email is a two - page invoice detailing @entity10 ’s work on the @entity95 case ( @entity133 ) from march to may 2008			0
one entry on april 8 reads : ‘ engaged with source in eliciting information re : forthcoming interviewing strategy to de [ sic ] deployed by @entity14			0
’ the next line records a £ 5,000 ‘ cash payment made to above source for information provided ’			0
the invoice is almost identical , including spelling mistakes , to those sent anonymously to the @entity14 more than three years later			0
detectives believe the invoices they received in 2011 are authentic but are a later version , with details of @entity10 ’s work on the @entity95 and @entity97 case included			0
@entity107 maintains that @entity97 fabricated the @entity10 invoices and denies making any corrupt payments			1
he agrees that he recommended the offshore source payment system to @entity106 but said none of his own confidential sources was registered this way			0
it is understood that @entity107 left @entity10 in 2009 after falling out with @entity106 over a client invoice			0
in a statement , @entity10 said : ‘ @entity10 ’s business relationship with @entity34 had no connection or role in respect of the @entity95 / @entity97 case whatsoever			0
the business relationship related to historic and wholly unrelated clients of @entity10 , the details of which remain absolutely confidential to those clients			0
‘ @entity34 has never made any source payments for or on behalf of @entity10 for any purpose , in the same way that @entity10 has never made any unlawful payments to serving police officers			1
