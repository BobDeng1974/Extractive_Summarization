the day 's newspapers carried the latest details , as well as pictures of a packed memorial service at @entity24 the previous day			1
mr @entity13 's unposed photos , a contrast to the rigid portrait photography of the age , show the bustle of the streets as tradesmen rumble past in horse - drawn carriages			2

children look on with a mixture of excitement an apprehension as adults can be seen hovering around a pub in the background snapshot : the pictures , taken on a saturday morning , show children thronging the streets as tradesmen tried to make their way between the brick buildings commercial : pedestrians can be seen packing the streets outside traditional shops in this business district of @entity4 broad streets : men , almost all wearing hats , can be seen walking from shop to shop as the day 's shopping begins stand and stare : shoppers and tradesmen seem intrguied by mr @entity13 's camera equipment , and stand back to stare directly into the shot then and now : the prospect down @entity82 looks very different today , but the distinctive shapes of the buildings are still recognisable passage of time : some buildings on @entity88 , in the background of the pictures above , are clearly the same as were pictured by mr @entity13 different : @entity91 , which is now called @entity92 , has the same shape as in 1912 , but does not resemble the old photographs very much one story dominated the morning papers on saturday april 20 1912			1
