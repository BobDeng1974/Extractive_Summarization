when @entity1 steps out to make his @entity3 debut , he will hope to have more luck than the last two players to wear the @entity6			1
for @entity7 and @entity8 were last seen displaying the number on the back of their shirts for the @entity13 , with any source of joy drowned out by a lack of effort and ineptitude			1
@entity1 inherits the number after a £ 16m deadline day swoop to the @entity21 from @entity22			1
@entity37 and @entity38 to name a few , and early on the @entity40 's career ( circa jan 2009 ) looked to be heading down a similar path			0
a solo strike against @entity43 was followed by an incredible four goals at @entity45 at @entity46			2
fans were sure the best player of @entity49 would maintain his form in the @entity51			1
but after a solid first full season at the club , performance levels dropped			0
as did the work - rate			0
the playmaker was later moved on to @entity30 , on loan , and then on a free			0
varied success : at first @entity8 looked like a star at the @entity21 not so much : a talented youngster , the no 23 shirt did n't do much for @entity7 in @entity62 having started his @entity13 career successful as a youngster as no 26 , the move to no 52 ( rumoured to be his wage packet ) for @entity7 was an odd one			1

it 's now time for @entity1 to put smiles back on the fans ' faces in that no 23 jersey .			1

@entity1 is new no 23 after signing from @entity22 for £ 16m
@entity7 wore shirt last season and scored two @entity51 goals
@entity8 impressed at first but lack of effort *hampered* chances
