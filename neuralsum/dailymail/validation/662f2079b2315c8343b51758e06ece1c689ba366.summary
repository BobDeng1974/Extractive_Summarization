despite the likes of auto giants @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 releasing electric cars , the technology has yet to become mainstream			2
and a major sticking point is the number of charging stations available			0
now @entity11 has created a concept tyre that could spell the end of these stations , and ultimately petrol cars , by charging the car as it drives			2
it is fitted with thermo - piezoelectric materials that convert heat into energy to charge an electric car without the need for a charging station			1
this conversion happens when the car is both stationary and moving called @entity30 , the tyre concept is fitted with thermo - piezoelectric materials			1
when parked , sunlight heats the tyre and this heat is transformed into electricity using the thermo - electric material			1
the tyre has also been designed to be ‘ ultra-black ’ to absorb as much heat as possible			2
when being driven , the friction between the tyre and the road as well as the ‘ squeezing ’ and movement of the piezoelectric material as it rolls generates a small electric voltage			1
@entity46 is the charge that builds up in materials such as those made of crystalline and ceramic structures			0
exposing them to mechanical force causes a separation of electrical charge , which sets up a voltage that can be used to charge products			0
when a piezoelectric material is squeezed rapidly , it produces a small electrical voltage for a moment			0
if a voltage is put across the material it makes a tiny change in shape			0
in 2001 , @entity67 , the @entity68 inventor best known for his wind - up radios , famously walked 100 miles across the @entity71 desert in his ’ @entity72 ’ , which charged a small battery that allowed him to use his mobile phone			2
this electricity is captured and directed to the car ’s battery to charge it as it moves			0
‘ this tyre generates electricity through the action of materials in the tyre that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions , ’ explained @entity11			1
‘ the materials used would optimise the tyre 's electricity generation capabilities as well as its rolling resistance			2
‘ as demand for electric cars grows , this technology has the potential to significantly contribute to the solution of future mobility challenges			2
‘ this visionary tyre technology could eliminate the vehicle - range anxiety motorists may have with electric cars			1
’ @entity11 also unveiled a second concept called ‘ @entity102 ’			1
this tyre features three internal tubes located beneath the tread near the inboard and outboard shoulders of the tyre , as well as the centre			0
it relies on an internal pump that moves air from the main air chamber to the three individual air chambers , or tubes			0
when parked , sunlight heats the tyre and this heat is transformed into electricity using the thermo - electric material			1
the tyre has also been designed to be ‘ ultra-black ’ to absorb as much heat as possible the tyre automatically adjusts - on its own - to three different positions based on road conditions and modes include the @entity127			1
eco / safety offers maximum inflation in all three tubes and reduces rolling resistance			0
the sporty position , with reduced inflation in the inboard shoulder tube , gives drivers more control of the car			0
when being driven , the friction between the tyre and the road as well as the ‘ squeezing ’ and movement of the piezoelectric material as it rolls generates a small electric voltage			1
@entity11 said the materials used would optimise the tyre 's electricity generation capabilities as well as its rolling resistance this electricity is captured and directed to the car ’s battery ( illustrated ) to charge it as it moves			0
there are no immediate plans to release the concept but the tyre - maker said it predicts future cars will use the technology while the @entity162 position , with maximimum inflation in the centre tube , stops the car from aquaplaning thanks to a raised tread in the centre of the tyre			1
there are no immediate plans to release these concepts but the tyre - maker said it predicts future cars will use the technology			1
‘ these concept tyres reimagine the role that tyres may play in the future , ’ said @entity173 , @entity11 's senior vice president and chief technical officer			0
‘ we envision a future in which our products become more integrated with the vehicle and the consumer , more environmentally friendly and more versatile			0

concept @entity18 tyre was unveiled at the @entity20
it is fitted with thermo - piezoelectric materials that convert heat into energy
this is charged either using sunlight or from friction when the tyre rolls
firm also unveiled a second concept called ' @entity102 '
this contains tubes that adjust pressure depending on the road conditions
there are no immediate plans to release these concepts
but the tyre - maker said it predicts future cars will use the technology
