a senior @entity1 clergyman yesterday became the first to enter into a gay marriage – in direct defiance of the archbishop of canterbury @entity4 – plunging the @entity1 into a fresh crisis			2
@entity8 @entity7 tied the knot with @entity10 under new laws allowing same - sex marriages pushed through by @entity13 in the face of bitter opposition from backbench mps and the @entity1			1
but @entity17 , 58 , now faces disciplinary action from the @entity1 and could be expelled from his work as a priest because the @entity21 has barred clergy from entering such unions , saying they undermine its traditional teaching that marriage should only be between a man and a woman			1
@entity8 @entity7 tied the knot with @entity10 , a move that may well cause his removal from the church archbishop @entity4 defended the policy in a radio interview last week , saying that if the @entity1 accepted gay marriage it could be ‘ catastrophic ’ for @entity41 in @entity42 , hundreds of whom had been killed by people who associated @entity39 with homosexuality			1
but the @entity43 - educated @entity17 , a hospital chaplain from @entity44 , @entity45 , said : ‘ i love this man and i want to be married to him			1
' that ’s what i want			0
it is the same as anyone who wants to get married			1
’ speaking exclusively to @entity53 , he described the private ceremony in front of family and friends in a local hotel as ‘ very joyous , very happy ’			0
he said he had told the @entity59 , @entity60 – in whose area he works as deputy senior chaplain of the @entity63 – of his intention to marry mr @entity10 , 51			1
but he refused to comment on the conversation , saying he was fully aware of the @entity1 ’s position			0
asked how he expected to feel after the ceremony , he said : ‘ we will feel married			1
’ @entity69 confirmed he had told @entity70 of the @entity21 ’ statement but would not say if he was planning disciplinary action			1
archbishop of @entity74 , @entity73 , who is now under immense pressure from members of the church @entity17 , a former parish priest and a divorced father of five , held his wedding under new laws that came into force last month giving gay couples the same rights to marriages as heterosexuals			1
gay clergy can already enter into civil partnerships if they promise to remain celibate , but these are primarily legal arrangements while marriages include public vows			2
under guideline from bishops published in february , clergy are not only barred from gay marriages but they can not conduct them for others or bless such unions in church			2
the @entity21 ’ pastoral guidance on @entity100 admitted there were disagreements even among the bishops , but said : ‘ we are all in agreement that the @entity39 understanding and doctrine of marriage as a lifelong union between one man and one woman remains unchanged			0
’ the guidance , signed by @entity4 and his counterpart in @entity113 , @entity112 , said the @entity21 ‘ considers it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same - sex marriage , given the need for clergy to model the @entity1 ’s teaching in their lives ’			1
the bishops will now come under huge pressure to crack down on @entity124 , especially as there are other clergy lining up to enter into gay marriages			2
one senior traditionalist cleric in the @entity1 ’s @entity129 said : ‘ this will become a crisis if no action is taken			2
‘ people are looking to the @entity1 to enforce its teachings and discipline			0
the clergy have taken vows of obedience in public and they ought to live by that			0
@entity70 should be stripped of his right to function as a clergyman			0
‘ this is a test of the authority of the bishops and a critical test for @entity4			0
’ but one leading liberal cleric said : ‘ this is wonderful			0
i congratulate the couple and hope the @entity1 will accept gay marriage very soon			0
