by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 in @entity3 the international row over @entity6 ’s praise for @entity7 intensified last night as the @entity8 backed the @entity10 leader and @entity12 families in @entity13 spoke of their ‘ hurt , disgust and betrayal ’			1
in @entity3 , the @entity17 president 's powerful press secretary @entity15 told the @entity18 that he ‘ agrees with the viewpoint of the @entity13 first minister ’			2
mr @entity15 – seen as the @entity21 of the @entity8 – spoke out as @entity17 newspapers poured praise on the @entity10 leader , threating to further damage @entity13 ’s international reputation			2
@entity7 's top spin doctor has backed @entity6 's praise for the @entity17 president which has sparked a global row in @entity13 , @entity12 demanded an ‘ unequivocal public apology ’ from the first minister			1
@entity32 , @entity13 chairman of the @entity33 in @entity34 , has written to mr @entity6 to condemn his ‘ crass words ’			2
in the @entity38 today , @entity37 mp @entity36 said @entity12 had expressed @entity6 ' disgust and astonishment ' at remarks supporting a regime ' which oppresses its own minority groups and silences its critics '			1
prime minister @entity45 said he ' wholeheartedly ' agreed with her , adding : ' i think what @entity6 said was a major error of judgement			1
' i think all of us in this @entity51 should be supporting the @entity12 desire to be a sovereign , independent country and to have the respect of the international community and party leaders for that ambition			0
' the first minister yesterday failed to apologise and claimed he was referring to the recent @entity59 when he said he admires @entity7 for restoring ‘ a substantial part of @entity17 pride ’			1
the row was triggered by an interview with former @entity37 spin doctor @entity21 for the latest edition of @entity65 , which took place on march 14			0
just days earlier , 80,000 @entity17 troops had amassed on @entity12 ’s borders and the @entity70 region of the country was annexed on march 18			2
in the interview , mr @entity21 asked about the @entity17 president , to which mr @entity6 replied : ‘ well , obviously , i do n’t approve of a range of @entity17 actions , but i think @entity7 ’s more effective than the press he gets i would have thought , and you can see why he carries support in @entity17			1
’ pressed on whether he admires @entity7 , the first minister added : ‘ certain aspects			0
he ’s restored a substantial part of @entity17 pride and that must be a good thing			1
’ yesterday , mr @entity32 said he has been ‘ overwhelmed ’ by the reaction of @entity12 to mr @entity6 ’s comments			1
‘ they are variously insulted , dismayed and upset that a high - profile politician aspiring to some favoured position in the history of these freedom loving isles should make poorly considered , erroneous and mistaken assessments and to express admiration of a dictatorial and criminal regime , ’ he said			0
first minister @entity6 has been heavily criticised by @entity12 families living in @entity13 ‘ even worse are the lame excuses given by his spokespersons over dates and events having already taken place in @entity70			1
the facts are that occupation of the @entity70 parliament took place at the end of february followed by the unconstitutional illegal ‘ referendum ’ on march 16 , organised by a government which had been taken over at gunpoint by a party that gained only 4 per cent of the vote in the 2012 election , and supported by @entity17 soldiers and gangs of men equipped and armed by @entity17			0
’ he added : ‘ mr @entity6 ’s words can only give succour to the perpetrator of such undemocratic action			0
mr @entity6 has to think before he speaks and he owes us a sincere apology			0
’ in his letter to the first minister , mr @entity32 wrote : ‘ the overwhelming comments are of hurt , disgust , betrayal and astonishment that any importantly placed person should have allowed themselves to apparently succumb to vanity and thoughtlessness , particularly to the sensitivities of @entity12 worldwide , let alone those living in @entity13			1
’ but in @entity17 , there was apparent delight yesterday that a @entity139 politician had given qualified support to @entity7			2
a writer for the @entity143 newspaper , @entity144 , said : ‘ is n't it nice when you are admired ? ‘ and when you are admired by heroes on the other side of the barricade , it 's a double pleasure			0
the first minister of scotland @entity6 has such feelings for the @entity17 president @entity7			1
and the love of the @entity155 is really worth it			0
’ foreign secretary @entity157 and leading politicians from all main parties have condemned mr @entity6 ’s remarks			0
writing in today ’s @entity18 , @entity37 mp @entity161 – who visited @entity12 with a cross-party @entity164 delegation earlier this month – said : ‘ his words are not fitting of the first minister of scotland , and i know that many people in @entity13 would agree with many of those whom i met in @entity12 , that @entity7 is not a man to be admired			1
and it is clear , that when it comes to this , neither is mr @entity6			0
’ armed @entity173 militians attack the regional police building of the eastern @entity12 city of @entity176 on tuesday @entity177 pledged yesterday that @entity179 partners - including those that border @entity12 or @entity17 - would be defended to the hilt if their sovereignty is threatened but the first minister said yesterday : ‘ @entity185 has been displayed as a figure of fun – somebody who wrestles with bears			2
‘ actually , i think that ’s a severe under - estimation of @entity7 and therefore to portray him in that light is wrong			0
‘ in terms of what i said about @entity17 pride , and what i was thinking of , was the @entity59			1
’ a spokesman for mr @entity6 added : ‘ the first minister will reply directly to [ mr @entity32 ’s ] letter making clear , as he did in the @entity65 interview , that he disapproves ‘ of a range of @entity17 actions ’			2
the @entity202 is entirely opposed to the @entity17 government ’s stance on human rights , homosexuality and indeed the illegal annexation of @entity70			0
‘ since this interview was conducted the @entity202 has made our position abundantly clear on the illegal annexation , including the decision to withdraw the invitation to the @entity17 consul general to the annual @entity216 dinner			0

@entity6 said @entity7 has restored ' a substantial part of @entity17 pride '
*furious* reaction from politicians in the @entity222 and in @entity12
*pro-russian* *separatists* in @entity12 have *gleefully* *seized* on his comments
but @entity12 living in @entity13 have expressed their ' hurt '
@entity45 *accuses* @entity6 of a ' major error of judgement '
