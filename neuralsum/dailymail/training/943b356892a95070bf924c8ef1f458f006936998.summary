@entity5 , 60 , ( left ) strangled his disabled wife @entity7 ( right ) to death after believing they were broke and going to be evicted , a court heard @entity5 , wearing a black suit and white shirt , showed no emotion as details of the killing were read out to the court and dozens of tearful family members			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , told the court how mrs @entity28 , 62 , had been sleeping on the sofa when she was awoken by her husband 's hands tightening around her neck			1
he said she opened her eyes and begged him to ' please stop , ' but he ignored her pleas and squeezed tight for up to two minutes until she stopped struggling			2
the mother - of - three , who walked with a frame and had a mobility scooter , attempted to fend him off , scratching her husband with her nails			2
the court heard how @entity28 , a former exemplary @entity40 employee , had lost his grip on reality as he descended into a mental crisis in the weeks before the killing			1
he became paranoid his neighbours were watching him , struggled to sleep and would periodically turn off all the lights and prevent his wife from making phone calls , the jury was told			2
@entity28 , who was due to retire imminently , became convinced that the couple had no money and would become homeless			1
however , police who carried out a financial audit after the killing , found @entity28 's fears about bailiffs were entirely unfounded , as he had plenty of money in the bank			1
he had been suffering from psychosis and delusions during a sudden spiral into severe depression , believing they would be convicted from their retirement flat in @entity10 ( pictured ) the court heard that by @entity71 was being seen by health professionals on an almost - daily basis , but he was finding no relief in his medication and had only had one counselling appointment			1
in her final days mrs @entity28 confided in her sisters about her fears for her safety as her husband 's mental condition declined further			1
she told sister @entity82 : ' i ca n't chuck him out because i still love the old b * * * * * *			0
' officers were called to the couple 's house at 7.28am on august 17 after @entity28 rang police to confess to the killing			1
mrs @entity28 's body was found on the couch where she had been sleeping and a post mortem examination showed the cause of death was compression of the neck			1
less than 24 hours before , a nurse had visited the home to prescribe @entity28 diazepam to help with his chronic insomnia and he was scheduled to see a consultant on the following monday			2
however , his mental health had deteriorated the day before he throttled his wife , as he had called 999 to get an ambulance for mrs @entity28 , believing she was ill. paramedics who came to the house were more concerned about @entity28 's health but he successfully masked the full extent of his problems in front of them			1
@entity28 was arrested and charged the following day with his wife 's murder but prosecutors dropped the initial charge after two psychologists agreed that @entity28 was so depressed he was not able to think clearly at the time he killed his wife			1
@entity28 previously admitted manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility when he appeared before a judge at @entity124			1
the court heard how troubled @entity28 had felt he had ' no way out ' of his mental prison , stopping to take the medication and making frequent crisis calls to mental health teams			2
appealing for leniency on account of @entity28 's delusional beliefs that he was carrying out a mercy killing , @entity135 , defending , said he was ' appalled ' at what he had done			2
' mr @entity5 did not plan to kill his wife , ' she said			1
' he has expressed remorse , he feels remorse , and this offence would never have happened but for the fact that he was demonstrably very unwell			0
' it was n't premeditated , it was n't planned but ( quoting @entity28 ) " i did n't want @entity7 to be part of the mess i had created "			2
' it was this kind of " mess " he wanted to stop , rather than @entity146			0
he was jailed for six years after pleading guilty to manslaughter at @entity124 ( pictured ) ' it is evident that by august 16 the calm , unflappable and reliable man known to his family , had changed beyond recognition			1
' ms @entity152 added : ' one would think what happened to him could almost happen to any one of us , because his life , until now , had been pretty unremarkable			0
' the couple had been together for more than 20 years after he separated from his first wife in 1993			2
@entity28 had left school aged 16 years and started working at @entity40 when he was aged 25 years , where colleagues described him as ' easy going ' and ' kind			1
' he had a daughter , @entity165 , from his first marriage , and mrs @entity28 had three sons , @entity168 , @entity169 and @entity170 , from a previous relationship			2
in a moving victim impact statement , her son @entity168 paid tribute to his ' kind , loving mother , ' who had battled cancer but ' never gave up			0
' his brother @entity169 was one of several family members who spoke of night terrors they have experienced since mrs @entity28 's death , saying he was haunted by nightmares in which @entity28 was chasing him			1
her sister @entity82 said : ' the day i received the phone call was the worst day of my life			0
' the first person i wanted to call was @entity7			0
she was always the first up dancing , having fun			0
even with her disabilities she was always enjoying life			0
' sentencing @entity28 to six years behind bars , a judge said he took the defendant 's severe mental health problems into account but that he had to bear some responsibility for his actions			1
judge @entity200 said : ' on the morning of august 17 you strangled to death your 62 - year - old wife @entity7 , a woman who had been together with you for some 20 years			1
' clearly she had a zest for life , she was greatly loved and will be missed by her family and friends			0
' in the days before her death , despite your behaviour , she was still professing her continuing love for you			0
' he said psychiatrists agreed @entity28 had been ' very unwell ' with a severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms and insomnia ahead of the attack , with ' delusions of poverty ' consuming him			1
there was said to be little risk , now @entity28 's illness had been successfully treated in prison with a mix of antidepressants and vital antipsychotics , of him re-offending			2
' sentencing in cases such as this that arise , at least in part , due to mental distress , is never straightforward , ' judge @entity200 continued			0
' although it is clear from the psychiatric evidence your mental responsibility for killing your wife was diminished , in my judgement , a not insignificant amount of responsibility remained			0
' you made the decision not to take all your medication			0
certainly you were able to mask the extent of your mental health difficulties			0
' at the time of your offence you were able to make up your mind to kill your wife			0
you knew she was vulnerable to attack because of her health			0
' she put up a struggle			0
you were strangling her for a considerable amount of time , because by then you were determined to kill her			0
you took the life of another human being			0
' @entity258 , chief crown prosecutor at the @entity259 , said they had discussed dropping the murder charge with mrs @entity28 's family			2
he said : ' when @entity28 pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility , we carefully and thoroughly reviewed all the evidence in this case , including the assessment of psychiatric experts			1
' in light of all the evidence , we took the view that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction for murder			0
' we fully discussed our decision to accept the plea with @entity7 's family			0
we hope that the conviction and today 's sentence brings them at least a small sense that justice has been done			0
' investigating officer chief inspector @entity286 said : ' this is a desperately sad case and although today 's decision will never bring @entity7 back , i hope it will go some way to helping @entity7 's family and friends feel that justice has been done			0
