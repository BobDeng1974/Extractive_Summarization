by @entity0 former bond girl @entity1 is , well let ’s say , very shaken and more than a bit stirred			1
‘ i do n’t like being called a vandal			1
that man is completely out of order			1
i ’m going to go for him			1
how dare he make sweeping statements about acts of vandalism ? that ’s defamation of character			1
‘ more than an apology i ’d like some compensation			1
he ’s going to realise you do n’t mess with @entity1			1
i do n’t care who he is			1
’ ‘ that man ’ is , actually , @entity19 , chairman of the very proper @entity20			2
and the ‘ act of vandalism ’ ? local dispute : @entity1 argues that she had permission to remove the trees from outside her home and claims she is being targeted by locals who want her to leave the area the local newspaper ran a story on mr @entity19 complaining about @entity1 cutting down two towering ‘ cypress trees ’ near the @entity32 property she ’s renovating in one of the spa town ’s leafier ( albeit less leafy now ) streets			1
‘ felling these trees basically amounts to vandalism , ’ said a hot - under - the - tweed - collar mr @entity19			1
‘ it ’s just property developers making cash without a care for the community ’			2
hear , hear , echoed @entity44 who ’s lived in the neighbourhood for 30 years and signed a petition to keep the trees			1
‘ the greenery of this area is what makes it so special			2
these trees are iconic and have been there since i moved in			1
’ but as @entity1 furiously points out , these are not cypress trees or anything else worthy of a tree preservation order			1
they were , in fact , cypress leylandii			2
you know , those huge , ugly weeds of trees that neighbours fall out over not being chopped down			1
hence , the council ’s delight when @entity1 and her husband , property developer @entity63 , applied for permission to remove them			1
she remembers the incident that fired the opening shot , a few weeks ago : ‘ this lady who ’s got a double barrelled name — @entity44 something - something — came up to my husband outside the house and started barking at him			2
when @entity63 said we had planning permission to take the trees down , she said , ‘ oh , they ’re iconic trees			1
’ ‘ i ’ve never heard of leylandii being called iconic trees , and , as @entity63 said : '' it must be the first time anyone ’s got a petition up to save a leylandii			1
but it ’s this gentleman , the chairman of the bridge club @entity19 , who has been the most vocal about this ' absolute act of vandalism ' — felling these trees			1
' ‘ several members of the club seemed to think they were yew trees because another rather rotund , florid , bridge - complexioned gentleman said to my husband , ' i gather you ’re cutting down this yew tree '			1
‘ @entity63 said , ' it ’s not a yew tree			2
it ’s a cypress leylandii '			2
he said , ' as far as we ’re concerned it ’s a yew ” and walked off '			2
' anger : @entity100 accused @entity1 of ' vandalism ' when she removed trees from outside her home in @entity104 , @entity105 ( pictured ) this is a script worthy of @entity107 from the sitcom @entity108			1
i suggest perhaps it would be best to put this whole spat down to a little misunderstanding between neighbours and invite them round for a sherry ? not , it seems , when you ’re do n’t - mess - with - me @entity1 , armed with a licence to fell			1
‘ when you move into any area , you want to have good relations with your neighbours			1
but this man called me a vandal			2
we had planning permission to take those trees down , but his misinformed allegation is now on the internet for anyone to read			1
‘ i bumped into @entity130 [ @entity44 ] on the train the other day			2
‘ she was apologising and tried to sit down			2
i said , ' please do n’t sit down			2
could you remain standing ? ' she looked at me and said , ' i had no idea the story would be so big			2
do you think it ’s because you ’re famous ? ' i felt like saying , ' i know you ’re aristocratic but do you really have no brain ? what did you think would happen when you went to the papers and said the house was mine ? ' i suspect this goes to the heart of the matter			2
the @entity20 is largely made up of ... well , think retired army officers , twin - sets , pearls and lots of tweed , who are increasingly having their noses put out of joint by the ‘ down from @entity151 ’ ( @entity150 ) breezing into this delightful regency town with their metropolitan ways and hiking house prices to exorbitantly high levels			2
@entity1 ’s @entity156 listed home cost an eye - watering £ 950,000 when she bought it this year			1
she expects to spend £ 500,000 more on the 4,500 sq ft property , which is being totally gutted ( under the watchful eye of the conservation folk at @entity164 )			2
@entity165 : @entity1 's naturalness is what drew so many of us to her on @entity169 's @entity170 last year where she dances alongside @entity171 the actress , who played a @entity174 spy in the 1985 film @entity176 with @entity177 and recently wowed us with her quickstep on @entity169 ’s @entity170 , has thrown herself into community life , volunteering for @entity181			1
‘ when we moved here [ she , @entity63 and their 18 - year - old daughter are in a rented house until the renovation is complete ] i asked the organisers if there was anything i could do			0
‘ i said , ' i want to be behind the scenes - one of the movers and shakers			0
' they bit my arm off			0
’ @entity1 and @entity63 first swapped suburbia for country life in 1999 when @entity198 was three and @entity63 ’s son whose mum died when he was two - was nine , and moved to a village near @entity202			1
‘ we had a river , a swimming pool , a tennis court and a huge house and i was truly happy for the first time in my life			0
’ as @entity1 began to blossom in her sprawling former vicarage by the @entity210 , she set up a successful buy - to - let business and began a newspaper property column			1
‘ when we first moved down there was a bit of scepticism			0
i remember dropping @entity198 off at school before going to a meeting in @entity218 so i had a nice outfit on			0
one of the mums turned to me and said , ' oh , that ’s what a yummy mummy looks like			0
' ’ she continues to look pretty yummy with her endless legs and strong jawline			0
@entity1 ’s had no @entity226 , no fillers and does n’t bother with the gym			1
her naturalness is what drew so many of us to her on @entity169 ’s @entity170 last year where she , she says , ‘ played the role of the aging glamourpuss ’			0
star : @entity1 says she ' played the role of the aging glamourpuss ' on @entity170 ‘ @entity198 and i used to watch it			1
i could n’t believe it when they asked me to do it after years below the parapet			0
it was strange to be back in the limelight again , but it was @entity198 who persuaded me to do it			0
‘ @entity170 was a wonderful step for re-establishing my own confidence			0
you arrive in the make - up department with no make - up and straggly hair only to emerge two hours later with this amazing face with eyelashes and about five people ’s hair on your head			0
those make - up girls make you feel really special			0
‘ a lot of the younger women on @entity170 had already had stuff done			0
‘ ageing is n’t easy			0
but i feel a whole lot better about myself than i did two years ago [ she gained two stone as a stay - at - home mum ] everywhere i go people stop me to say how much they loved me on that show			0
’ while @entity1 was happy in @entity202 , she wanted more of a buzz			1
they sold the vicarage for ‘ considerably less ’ than the £ 2.75 million asking price and moved to @entity104			0
‘ we go through different phases in our lives			0
i ’m entering the next phase and pre-empting the empty nest syndrome			0
@entity63 is in @entity218 now and @entity198 ’s about to start a gap year			0
‘ the children were n’t appreciating the country idyll			0
suddenly , we thought , ‘ we do n’t need it any more			0
’ ‘ @entity63 and i feel this is our time			0
we can do all the things we could never do when we got married because we had @entity63 so we had an instant family			0
we never had alone time			0
‘ we ’re both excited about creating a life here in @entity104			0
’ the renovations should be complete by september			0
hopefully , by then , the tree saga will be forgotten			0
‘ the first people i invite round will be the bridge club , ’ she announces with a smile			0
whether they come or not , remains to be seen .			0
