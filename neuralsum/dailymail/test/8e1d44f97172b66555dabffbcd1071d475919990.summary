@entity1 doctor @entity0 , who has served the club for almost 40 years , has quit the @entity4 club in the fall - out of their shock @entity9 defeat by @entity10			1
@entity0 claims the @entity13 champions ' medical department has been blamed for wednesday night 's 3 - 1 first - leg defeat in @entity15 which left their @entity9 hopes hanging by a thread			1
the 72 - year - old medical professional , renowned as a world leader in his field , said ' the bond of trust is damaged ' and called the blame centred at his department ' inexplicable '			1
his son @entity24 , @entity24 and @entity25 , who are all part of the team at @entity1 , have also resigned			1
@entity1 doctor @entity0 has quit in the fall - out of their shock defeat by @entity10 the 72 - year - old is renowned as a world leader in his field and has been at @entity1 for almost 40 years @entity0 ( fourth from left ) sits behind @entity33 during the defeat on wednesday evening @entity0 has often courted controversy with his methods			1
he claims that a substance called @entity38 , which is extracted from the crest of cockerels , helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain			2
he also swears by @entity43 , an amino acid preparation derived from calves ' blood			0
in 2009 , he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat 's blood to @entity51 striker @entity50 for his hamstring injury			2
among those to have been treated by him are @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			0
@entity0 claims to have administered more than one million injections , at least half of which have been to athletes			1
a statement from @entity0 read : ' after the @entity9 match of @entity1 against @entity10 the medical department was for some inexplicable reason made primarily responsible			1
the bond of trust is damaged			0
' and on friday morning , the club released the following statement : ' @entity1 notes with regret the decision of chief medical officer dr @entity0 ( 72 ) to resign his medical duties at the club			1
' @entity74 in particular , but also his team , have performed first - class work for the club and its players over the years			2
our sincere thanks are due for this			0
' @entity1 will shortly announce new arrangements for the club â€™s medical unit			1
until then dr @entity86 , sports physician and consulting physician in trauma surgery and orthopaedics , will support the @entity1 team at matches			1
' @entity33 had just 14 fit players to choose from at the @entity93 do @entity94 and the @entity1 manager implied in his post-match comments that the defeat was down to the lack of available players			1
' we have players who were out a long time with injuries , ' he said			1
' their legs do n't last very long			2
it 's a tough result to take into the second leg , but we 'll give it a go			2
' @entity0 comes to @entity1 's @entity109 during a @entity4 game last month @entity33 failed to win the @entity9 in his first season in @entity112 and is on the brink of exit again speaking at a press conference on friday , @entity33 said : ' it was his decision to leave , i respect his decision			1
' @entity33 and @entity0 have reportedly had differences of opinion on several previous occasions including over the fitness of midfielder @entity124 ahead of last summer 's @entity125			1
@entity126 , @entity127 , @entity109 , @entity128 and @entity129 were among those missing from the @entity1 squad on wednesday through injury			1
@entity133 and @entity134 have also struggled with long - term problems			1
footage circulating online appears to show @entity33 aiming sarcastic applause at his bench against @entity138 last week after centre back @entity126 was withdrawn with an injury			1
@entity1 say the announcement was unexpected			1
media director @entity142 said : ' we have no knowledge of this release , so we can not comment			2
' @entity56 was one of many athletes to benefit from @entity0 's treatment at the @entity148 @entity0 has worked with the @entity13 national team as well as athletes including @entity56 and @entity151			1
the @entity1 fall - out will not end his work with @entity155 's team			1
' he is the best doctor in the world , ' @entity56 said after being treated by @entity0 at the @entity148 in 2012			1
' the doctor is a very , very great man			2
thank you , doctor ! ' he previously quit @entity1 after falling out with then - coach @entity161 in the 2008 - 09 season but returned after the manager left			1
the @entity13 champions return to @entity4 action on saturday when they face @entity166 at the @entity167			1
@entity56 sought the help of @entity0 in the weeks leading up to the @entity148 in 2012			2
at the time , @entity170 's @entity169 recalled his experiences with the doctor			2
there 's not much i have in common with @entity56			2
he 's certainly a little quicker than i was at my peak			2
but we shared the same doctor when it came to turning to someone in need of urgent repair			0
when i was a @entity182 player , i regularly used the tricks and skills of doctor @entity0 to rescue me from another injury			1
now @entity56 , the greatest sprinter of all time , is visiting his @entity188 clinic to try and be fit for the @entity148 , which start in 18 days			0
i 've read in these pages about @entity191 's methods being described by a senior figure within the @entity193 as ' @entity194 '			0
i 'm not sure what that means , although with me he would use fluid taken from the comb on the head of a hen to lubricate a knee joint that had been eroded by a succession of injuries			0
he would tell me that it was like ' high quality oil for the engine of a car '			0
he concluded that the fluid taken from a hen 's comb would lubricate the knee and allow greater movement			0
i was happy to do what he suggested to have the confidence to play again			0
i 've also read about him prescribing goat 's blood injections for hamstring injuries			2
his methods are successful , which is what has drawn @entity219 around the world from his @entity222 training camp and why so many go to see the man they call ' healing @entity0 '			2
among the sportsmen and women who have stepped into @entity0 's dimly lit office are @entity228 , @entity55 , @entity161 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity231			1
there is talk of controversy about @entity0 's methods , but i wo n't have a bad word said against him			1
i saw him many times and there was never anything untoward suggested			0
this is not a back - street quack			0
he is still @entity1 's team doctor , world renowned and a master of his art - and they did n't seem to be doing too badly the last time i watched them in the @entity9 final			1
bolt versus his @entity222 training partner , @entity250 , is the golden ticket for @entity252			0
last weekend , @entity250 beat @entity56 , the fastest man on the planet , in back - to - back races over 100m and 200m			0
@entity56 then withdrew from the @entity256 race in @entity257 and the alarm bells are ringing			0
nobody wants him to miss these games , surely not even @entity250			0
athletes generally turn to @entity0 as a last act of desperation , having exhausted all the local practices and medical skills of those they have been closest to			2
you ca n't tell me that @entity56 has flown all the way from @entity222 to @entity188 without trusting @entity0 's art and without searching for a solution a little closer to home			1
like me , he must trust his methods and rely on his advice			0
he is renowned for helping sportsmen and women , like @entity56 , recover from hamstring problems			0
when i tore a hamstring playing for @entity279 , i was out for five months			0
he is getting sportsmen back on track within five weeks			0
i only wish i had known about him then			0
it appears @entity56 has a back problem which may have affected his right hamstring			0
it does n't sound as if @entity56 has suffered a tear , more likely a tweak and if he is unable to trust his hamstrings it might explain why some of his times have been sluggish , by his standards			0
@entity291 , the former @entity13 international , first recommended @entity0 to me when i did n't know where else to turn			1
i hopped on a plane with the @entity182 physio , hoping we could find some answers			0
when i first met him , i was anxious , but he made me feel welcome and relaxed			0
he was in his 60s ( he 's 70 next month ) , but he had the skin of a man 20 years younger , with a shock of hair and healthy outlook on life			0
he believes in the power of positive thinking , he is a charismatic man who convinces you he can find the answers			0
most doctors do , but he backs it up with achieving success			0
his staff are dressed from head to toe in white and he is there , overseeing the treatments and working from 7am - 11pm , trying to find the solutions for a conveyor belt of people , including the general public , who come looking for answers			2
my club , @entity182 , paid for my treatment through insurance , but when i bumped into @entity0 at a recent @entity9 game , he asked me how my knee was and i told him it was still causing me hassle			1
he told me to come and see him and after some treatment i asked him where i could pay the bill			0
he said : ' there is n't one , @entity330			0
' it was a kind gesture from a very skilled man			0
@entity0 has worked with the @entity13 national team as well as athletes including @entity56			1

@entity1 's long - serving doctor @entity0 quits
@entity13 champions lost 3 - 1 in the @entity9 to @entity10 this week
@entity0 claimed he and his staff were blamed for the defeat
@entity1 release statement on friday thanking @entity0 for his services and saying they ' regret ' his decision
@entity33 on friday said he ' respects ' @entity0 's decision
@entity33 seemed to place blame on injuries in post-match *interview*
