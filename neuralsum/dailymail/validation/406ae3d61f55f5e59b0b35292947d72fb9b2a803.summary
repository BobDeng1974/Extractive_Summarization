lord @entity0 believes that boycotts only serve to ' damage competitors and athletes ' ' i will always oppose boycotts of sport , because i do n't think they actually achieve what they set out to do , ' said @entity0			1
' the only people they really damage are competitors and athletes			2
' @entity19 told @entity20 he will push @entity22 's chancellor @entity43 towards tougher sanctions against @entity5 , citing the fact @entity46 are forced to host matches 1,200km away in @entity48 because their home city is occupied by @entity51 separatists			1

as long as there are @entity5 troops in @entity3 i think a @entity4 in that country is unthinkable , ' @entity19 told @entity20			1
@entity0 , however , believes politicians should use sport as a ' soft power ' to try to bring about change through inclusion rather than exile or boycott			1
@entity3 president @entity19 wants @entity5 to withdraw all troops from his territory conflicts have been ongoing between @entity3 and @entity5 , leading to a call for a 2018 @entity4 boycott ' i think it is far better to have sport as a soft power , helping change all sorts of things , and we ca n't pick , we ca n't a la carte menu sport , ' said @entity0			1
' you either believe in its power to change and to be a catalyst for social and political change or you do n't			0
' i happen to believe that sport has done far more to bring communities together than to isolate and separate them			0

the 10k run will be held on sunday , july 19 , and will be the first event staged in the former @entity92 at @entity86			0
@entity0 rates coaxing more young people into athletics as the greatest challenge facing the sport , and his ideas to boost participation form the crux of his manifesto for the @entity13 presidency			2

' attempts by the @entity137 to resurrect the @entity139 football side for the 2016 @entity140 look under threat , amid opposition from @entity144 and @entity145 bosses			0

' but we will see where that gets to			0
' i know from my own experience of having chaired the organising committee that that is a complex process , but i 'll leave that to my colleagues at the @entity151 and the home nations to figure out			0
' @entity169 is always better than disagreement , but it really is a matter for the home nations and the @entity151			0
