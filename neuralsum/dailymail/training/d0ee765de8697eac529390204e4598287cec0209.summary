@entity2 – dubbed the @entity14 – had used human rights law to claim the public should be kept in the dark about his bid to move to an open jail			1
but , after a legal challenge by the @entity21 and other newspapers , the @entity6 quashed the secrecy order			2
it removes the chilling prospect of the public not knowing if one of the most dangerous men in @entity28 is close to being released			2
last night , @entity29 , the mother of his three victims , called for criminals to be banned from exploiting the @entity33 and said it was vital that press freedom to report the workings of the criminal justice system be protected			1
her plea came as police seek to impose draconian restrictions on the identification of suspects			0
‘ why should n’t criminals be named , ’ asked mrs @entity29			0
‘ we do n’t know who we ’re walking next to these days – the public has a right to know			2
' if he was to move next door , you would have to know exactly who and what he was			0
it may stop people doing what he did if they knew how it ruined lives			2
” @entity2 , now 62 , committed one of the most horrific crimes of the past 40 years when , on friday april 13 , 1973 , he murdered the three children of mrs @entity29 – who was then known as @entity62 – and her husband @entity63			1
he was a lodger with the couple and had been babysitting at their @entity67 home when the youngest child , nine - month - old @entity69 , began crying for her bottle			2
@entity2 went berserk , battering @entity69 to death			1
her brother @entity73 , four , was strangled and @entity74 , two , had her throat cut			0
police found their mutilated bodies impaled on a neighbour ’s railings			0
he was jailed for life , with a minimum term of 20 years			1
since this term expired , he has been trying to secure his freedom but has yet to be released by the @entity85			2
@entity73 ( left ) , @entity74 ( right ) and @entity69 ( centre ) , pictured with their mother @entity29 , were murdered by @entity2 in 1973 a picture from the time shows the scene where the bodies of @entity73 , four , @entity74 , two , and nine - month - old @entity92 were found after being impaled on railings @entity2 , pictured in 1973 , has spent 40 years in jail and has made nine requests for parole in that time the triple killing has continued to shock the @entity28 for the last 40 years a key step on the road to freedom is moving to an open jail			1
@entity2 has previously spent two years in an open prison , where he was allowed out on day release , but was returned to a closed prison at an undisclosed location			1
1973 : @entity2 murders the three children of the family he is lodging with 1975 : he is the victim of a serious assault in prison 1978 : threatened with violence 1991 : prison cell fouled by other inmates just four days after he goes into closed conditions 1994 : threatened with violence after press reports 1995 : several prisoners try to attack him in an open prison but their plan is thwarted 1996 : victim of another serious assault while serving in the general prison population 2005 : threatened with violence after press reports 2006 : pictured in @entity126 where he was visiting a hostel from @entity129 2009 : unsuccessfully fought home secretary 's decision that he must remain in category c prison but was given anonymity order that lasted until today january 2013 : keeps anonymity as he applies to be moved to an open prison may 22 , 2013 : anonymity order overturned earlier this year , @entity2 launched a legal challenge against the @entity85 ’s latest refusal of his bid to move to an open jail			1
in an extraordinary ruling , the judge agreed to a request by his lawyers that his identity should be kept secret throughout the proceedings			0
they used the @entity33 to claim that – if inmates found out what he had done – he could be attacked			1
the @entity21 and other newspaper groups – backed by justice secretary @entity153 – immediately challenged the ruling to defend the principle of open justice			2
challenging the anonymity order at a hearing last month , @entity157 , appearing for mr @entity156 , said of @entity2 ’s crimes : ‘ the full facts are exceptionally horrific by even the standard of murders			1
’ the gagging order restricted the media to saying they were ‘ three sadistic murders – but that does n’t even give you the half of it ’ , said mr @entity157			1
yesterday , @entity171 , sitting with @entity172 , said : ‘ in our judgment , there is at present no real and immediate risk to the claimant ’s life and safety because he is serving his sentence in conditions in which his safety can be closely monitored			1
’ @entity2 ’s next parole review – his ninth – is under way , with a target date of august 1 for a hearing , although @entity171 said it was ‘ doubtful ’ that date would be met			1
if it was , and it was recommended he be returned to open conditions , that could occur in october , said the judge			1
if he did go back to open conditions , the review would have to consider steps that could be taken to protect @entity2 , which ‘ might include a change of name ’			1
mr @entity153 said : ‘ i welcome the court ’s decision			0
this is a clear victory for open justice			1
’ the only reason that @entity2 has ever given for the killing is that @entity92 was crying for her bottle a police officer stands guard outside the house in @entity209 , @entity67 , where @entity2 was a lodger and scene of the murder of the children lawyers for the @entity14 used four sections of the @entity33 to try to keep his identity secret			1
these were article 2 ( the right to life ) ; article 3 ( the right to protection from ill - treatment ) ; article 5 ( the right to liberty and security ) and article 8 ( the right to privacy and a family life )			2
most weight was placed on articles 2 and 3 , with @entity233 , @entity2 ’s lawyer , insisting that there was ‘ a serious likelihood of a serious attack ’ if fellow prison inmates learned of his identity through the media			1
but lord justice @entity171 said @entity2 – who is in a vulnerable prisoner unit – could have his safety ‘ closely monitored ’ in jail			1
@entity29 , the mother of his victims , said : ‘ he does n’t deserve human rights , he ’s not even human			2
he committed such a horrendous crime and should have to face up to it			0
‘ what about my human right to live my life without looking over my shoulder because the killer of my children is roaming free ? what about the human rights of my children ? ’ child killer @entity2 murdered three children in @entity67 in 1973 , pictured shortly after his arrest they were , in the words of high court judge mr justice @entity172 , ‘ exceptionally horrific crimes ’			1
three children were murdered , apparently for no other reason than to silence the crying of a nine - month - old baby			1
then , their small bodies broken , they were impaled on garden railings in an act of grotesque savagery that shocked the nation			0
the date was friday , april 13 , 1973			2
@entity29 , then known as @entity62 , was 23 and working as a barmaid in @entity67			0
her husband @entity270 had gone to collect her from work and had left their children in the care of @entity2 , a family friend and lodger			1
the children knew him well , and had played with him happily in the past			2
the couple thought they had no reason to worry about the welfare of their children			2
yet , when they returned to their home in @entity209 , @entity67 , they discovered that the police were waiting for them			0
an officer escorted to them to the local police station and broke the news : @entity73 , four , @entity74 , two , and baby @entity69 were all dead			0
the couple were told @entity2 had admitted killing them , but that police were still looking for their bodies			1
later that night , they were found in a row , impaled on a neighbour ’s spiked garden railings			0
@entity2 , 21 , who had been kicked out of the @entity299 , reportedly told police that @entity69 had wanted her bottle and would n’t stop crying			1
‘ i put my hand over her mouth and it went from there , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s all in the house			0
on @entity307 used a wire			0
i was going to bury [ @entity73 ] but i could n’t … i went outside and put them on the fence			0
all i can hear is kids , kids , kids			0
’ @entity73 was strangled , @entity74 had had her throat cut and @entity69 died from a compound fracture to the skull			0
it remains unclear if there was more to the killings and prison psychologists who interviewed @entity2 explored the possibility that there may have been a ‘ sexual motive ’			1
mrs @entity29 , who took an overdose six months after losing her children , and has since moved to @entity326 in @entity327 , said she had lived through ‘ 40 years of hell ’			2
‘ if he was released , i ’d be waiting outside with a gun , ’ she said yesterday			0
‘ life should mean life and he should never get to walk free			0
he got off lightly with a life sentence – he should have been hanged			0
‘ i think about what he did every minute of every day because he took my life away			0
i ca n’t go to family parties any more , i ca n’t celebrate anything			0
put yourself in my shoes , how would you feel ? ‘ i ca n’t and will never move on			0
for what he did to my three children and me , he deserves the same treatment that they got – death			0
