@entity0 perfectly captures the attitude of many towards @entity3 in her famous @entity5 line ' @entity3 is the one night of the year a girl can dress like a slut and no one can say anything about it ! ' this line , uttered in the cult film @entity5 by @entity12 , perfectly encapsulates the attitude of many towards @entity3			2
originally a pagan festival influenced by @entity15 , @entity3 's adoption by @entity17 saw the mass commercialisation of the day , with things like trick - or - treating and pumpkin carving being invented			2
but over the last few decades it has become increasingly sexualised - particularly women 's costumes			1
research has found that 51 per cent of @entity26 think that @entity3 costumes on sale aimed at women are over-sexualised , and , more worryingly , the majority of people ( 69 per cent ) think that children ’s @entity3 costumes on sale are not age appropriate			1
even avoiding specifically ' adult ' themed @entity3 costumes , a brief look across nearly all retailers shows that most women 's costumes involve a short skirt or plunging neckline and are often pushing the boundaries of modesty			1
however , and perhaps unsurprisingly , 58 per cent of men did not think women ’s @entity3 costumes were over-sexualised , but two thirds of women felt the opposite			1
in general , parents are not impressed with children ’s @entity3 costumes on sale , with 83 per cent finding them to be inappropriate for the age at which they are marketed			1
a brief look across nearly all retailers shows that most women 's costumes involve a short skirt or plunging neckline , similar to the outfits worn by @entity87 ( left ) and @entity88 ( right ) last year @entity89 , founder of @entity90 , who commissioned the study , commented on the findings : ' @entity3 is meant to be a time where you dress up in scary costumes , not sexy			1
our results show that many women feel that the choice available to them is not equal to men ’s choices with the main focus of the outfit being sexy rather than scary			2
' he added : ' we can see that some outfits on sale for children are also inappropriate for the age ranges the clothes fit			2
whether they are a scary film character a child should not know about or a rather revealing outfit for a young girl			0
obviously many parents feel the same , which is why it is important to push for more family friendly costumes this @entity3			1
' parenting blogger @entity119 from @entity120 has been in search of @entity3 outfits but tells @entity123 she has struggled to find an outfit which is scary rather than sexy : searching the supermarkets was my first thought however my local one only has children 's outfits which forced me online			1
now i made the mistake of doing this with @entity133 ...			0
. i 'm not sure if you 've searched for ' women 's halloween dressing up outfits ' yet ... it 's eye opening that 's sure			1
now try that search and pull up the images instead as i did			0
apart from a few exceptions i could see ( as could my 4 year old daughter ) anything and everything seems to go as a @entity3 outfit , and it seems the tighter , shorter and low cut the better			0
now i 'm no proud and have been to an adults only dressing up party before so have worn these types of outfits in the past ; but what about family dressing up parties ? searching through @entity154 seems to bring up the worst culprits - nearly all of those are boob tubes and only just cover your knickers - not something i would wear in front of children or with children around			0
they would n't be out of place in an @entity167 catalogue ! ! heading to a fancy dress costume website i thought i may find more choice but actually they were n't that much better - if you look in the women 's section they too are tight fitting and really short or even the long ones have high splits up the legs and low cut busts to them			1
one of the better costumes @entity119 managed to find this is one of the better costumes i managed to find			0
now there is n't actually anything wrong with it at all however i 'm not really sure i want my daughter to see me in it either			0
at the age of 4 she is very impressionable as are all young girls			0
so why do we need to have only sexy style costumes available to us women ? thankfully when looking for costumes for my daughter i have found them to be very appropriate and i am actually spoilt for choice in her outfits			2
i think it 's actually very cute to see the children all dressed up in their witches outfits with their broomsticks and hats			0
i just really wish that i was able to join my daughter , however to date i 've not found a witches outfit which is n't either short enough to just about cover my knickers and would require me to wear thermal tights ( it 's october and freezing after all ) or leggings to cover my pride , or which requires the tops of my legs to be shaven - i 've said before , it 's october and freezing ! ! why do witches all have to be sexy ? i 'm sure in the story books they are n't or in the horror movies !			0

@entity213 ( 69 **%** ) think children 's @entity3 outfits are not age appropriate
over half think costumes aimed at women are over-sexualised
unsurprisingly 58 **%** of men did not feel this way about women 's costumes
older generations have *significantly* more problem with the outfits
