if @entity1 needs persuading to take @entity2 on a permanent deal at the end of the season , then he 'll still be in two minds after the match at @entity8			1
the @entity10 man has warned the @entity11 he must prove he is worth a long - term contract with goals			1
@entity2 fluffed his lines big time at @entity15 on saturday , missing a series of chances to make his point to @entity19			1
@entity2 stands in the middle of the @entity15 pitch with his hands on his hips the @entity10 star ( left ) posted a victory picture with team - mate @entity26 on his @entity27 @entity2 smashes a shot towards the @entity8 goal for @entity10 @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 ( right ) of @entity8 challenge @entity2 during the first - half at @entity15 @entity2 touched the ball four times in the @entity8 box the first came in the 13th minute , taking down @entity38 's superb lofted pass on his chest , @entity2 had time to pick his spot - he shot straight at @entity41 , though			1
beyond that , his first - half involvement was minimal			0
while @entity10 were dominant in possession , the @entity44 was being starved of decent service			2
but if @entity2 thought his first - half was one to forget , worse was to follow			2
unmarked from six yards , the striker somehow failed to direct his angled header from @entity51 's cross past @entity41 , who made an excellent stop in the 56th minute			2
the @entity11 international will have nightmares about kicking thin air with the goal gaping from six yards after @entity58 's low cross in the 76th minute			0
it was one for the end of season blooper show			0
@entity8 's goalkeeper @entity41 ( left ) rushes out to deny @entity2 when the @entity11 takes a shot at him @entity41 dives to his right with his hands out to prevent @entity2 from scoring on saturday at @entity15 @entity41 ( left ) holds on to the arm of @entity2 after another chance goes begging at @entity15 @entity2 slices the ball as @entity30 ( right ) challenges him for the ball in the air at @entity15 the on - loan @entity72 striker tries to get @entity73 ( right ) and @entity30 ( left ) during the @entity75 clash and that summed up his afternoon ; a touch - any touch - would have put @entity10 2 - 0 up			1
how he missed will remain a mystery			0
so does his future at @entity79 after saturday 's misfiring performance			0
although his unimpressive afternoon did n't dampen the @entity11 's spirits as he posted a picture on the train home with @entity10 team mate @entity26			0
he said : ‘ with my friend @ @entity86 are returning home by train and happy for the victory			0
’ @entity2 is challenged by @entity8 's @entity90 ( right ) who grabs on to the @entity10 striker 's neck @entity2 ( right ) tries to get away from @entity93 who slides in to try and tackle the @entity11			1

@entity10 beat @entity8 2 - 0 at @entity15
@entity2 started the match but failed to find the target
@entity8 keeper @entity41 denied @entity2 three times at @entity15
