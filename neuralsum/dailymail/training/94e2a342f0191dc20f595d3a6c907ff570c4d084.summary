' i loaded the syringe , put it in my arm , injected it and it swelled me up right there and then			2
' to tell you the truth , i did n't feel a thing			1
there was sometimes a bit of dizziness but nothing apart from that			2

' @entity129 : mr @entity30 shows off his muscles and poses with a passer - by at the beach in @entity29 incredible : the muscleman flexes his biceps for he benefit of the cameras no contest : a comparison of mr @entity30 's biceps muscle with those of a young passer - by ' the women around here and in other places admire him , ' said mr @entity30 's brother @entity144 , 56 injecting site enhancement oils carry the risk of infection and of abscesses developing in the muscle			1
these abbesses can grow and spread within the tissue			2
some users , when operated on , have been found to have arms full of pus and oil			0
mr @entity30 has fears for his own health and has visited a clinic for help			0
but medics have so far refused to operate because ' he did it to himself '			1
mr @entity30 said : ' if i get ill , if my arms burst , that 's when i can go and see the doctor			0
but for me that 's normal and something i 've accepted			0
' since he began injecting two years ago , he has become the talk of the town , to the horror of his family			0
his sister @entity173 said the family were ' extremely worried ' about him but still hoped he would settle down and have a family			0
' he is a good person , not a bad person			0
he is really friendly and does lots of favours for people , ' she said			0
' but there are some people who make fun of him			0
there are some people who find it interesting			0
and there are some people who think he is from another planet			0
' but his brother @entity192 , 56 , said the beefcake look is not without its advantages , especially so in its appeal to women			0
' the women around here and in other places admire him			0
they think he looks nice , ' he said			0

' have you ever seen a guy as big as me claiming it is natural ? he is lying , i tell you			0
at least i tell the truth			0
' it stopped for a bit because it was becoming too visible			0
but they are still using it , only they are using it undercover			0
