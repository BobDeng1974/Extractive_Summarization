@entity0 had criticised @entity1 only a few months ago for not being ‘ far enough behind ’ @entity2 in the polls – because he ought to be pushing through unpopular policies			2
as the @entity8 grappled with her towering legacy , a friend of the former prime minister said she had also expressed a dislike of the @entity11 and urged voters not to support @entity13			2
@entity0 ’s death has prompted a surge of pride among @entity8 mps at her government ’s extraordinary achievements , but also a degree of soul - searching about the party ’s failure to win the last election outright			1
leaders : @entity0 ( right ) had criticised @entity1 ( left ) only a few months ago for not being ' far enough behind ' @entity2 in the polls - because he ought to be pushing through unpopular policies several senior figures contrasted her refusal to bow to the whims of ‘ focus groups ’ or the next day ’s headlines unfavourably with the behaviour of today ’s political leaders			1
but left - wing commentator @entity34 complained that her death was prompting ‘ a mixture of @entity38 ’s funeral and a month - long political broadcast for the @entity8 ’			1
@entity40 , a @entity8 mp who visited @entity0 weekly , said : ‘ i remember last november showing her a poll in one of the sunday papers and it showed that we were nine points behind , and she asked when the next election was , and i said it was n’t for another two and a half years			1
‘ she said , “ that ’s not far enough behind at this stage			2
” she sort of took a view that to do things that were right did entail unpopularity until people saw that what you were doing was working			2
‘ she always had confidence that what she was doing would work and coincide with the electoral cycle , which is , despite the fact that she ’s been written up as this incredibly controversial , divisive figure , why she won three general elections and was in power for 11 and a half years			1
’ in february 1981 , @entity68 led @entity0 by 16 points , but he went down to a crushing defeat in 1983			2
praise : @entity72 ( left ) spoke in support of her leadership , while @entity40 mp ( right ) said she ' took a view that to do things that were right did entail unpopularity until people saw that what you were doing was working ' and at the height of the poll tax furore in april 1990 , @entity2 had a 23 per cent lead , but went on to lose the 1992 election			1
mr @entity40 also illustrated @entity0 ’s uncompromising view of the @entity11 , explaining : ‘ on one occasion , one colleague said to her , “ of course @entity0 , we ’ve gone into coalition with the @entity92 ”			1
' she sort of took a view that to do things that were right did entail unpopularity until people saw that what you were doing was working ' @entity40 , @entity8 mp who visited @entity0 weekly ‘ and she looked at him and raised her index finger and jabbed it at him and said : “ i have not gone into coalition with the @entity92 ”			1
’ ‘ she wanted to see a stand - alone @entity8 government			1
she was a tribal conservative to her fingertips			2
’ mr @entity40 insisted she believed only the @entity8 , not @entity13 , could deliver the necessary changes in @entity105			1
‘ @entity0 was a @entity8 all her career and died a @entity8 , ’ he said			2
‘ she wanted the conservative party to thrive			2
‘ now that does n’t mean that she did n’t have regard for those who have sympathy for @entity13 , but she understood that only the conservative party is the big enough vehicle to deliver the change that she would want to see in @entity105 and in @entity115			2
’ support : @entity118 mayor @entity117 also suggested that @entity0 towered above current political leaders , saying : ' her memory will live long after the world has forgotten the grey suits of today ¿ s politics ' @entity0 – whom friends say had periods of lucidity , even though her short - term memory was badly affected by a series of small strokes in her final years – was broadly critical of modern politicians , he added			1
