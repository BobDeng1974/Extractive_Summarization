@entity0 has long enjoyed a love affair with all things @entity3 , from wine to high fashion			2
now cosmetic surgery is being transformed by the introduction of the ‘ haute couture ’ boob job from @entity3			2
it means every enhancement can be unique instead of simply a choice of cup size			2
a new range of implants with 600 possible variations gives women a bewildering choice of gels , shapes , textures and volumes from the very large to the conical			1
and instead of the trend to just make breasts bigger , the effects of surgery can be far more subtle			2
the range capitalises on a new desire for more discrete surgery , exemplified by the ‘ has - she - or - has n’t - she ’ looks of @entity26 and @entity45			1
and for the first time the implants are being marketed directly to women , rather than just surgeons , as consumers have become more clued up following the @entity52 scandal			1
plastic surgeons say the choice reassures those left anxious after up to 47,000 women in @entity0 were fitted with defective implants made from industrial - grade silicone			1
women can have much more control over their operations , and the implants come with a lifetime guarantee			1
inspiration : women want their breasts to look like @entity45 's consultant plastic surgeon @entity67 , of @entity68 , said : ‘ there is now a matrix of implants , in lots of different widths , profiles and shapes			1
' you get a result that is tailored to your body			0
and the internet is changing everything			0
women know exactly what they want and can get it			1
' it ’s the end of the days of walking into the surgeon saying “ i want a boob job ” and them replying , “ yeah ok , sign this illegible consent form and we ’ll sort you out			0
” no two boob jobs will be alike			0
’ the new @entity94 range has been introduced by @entity95 , which already owns @entity0 - manufactured implant @entity96			1
it has a ‘ @entity104 ’ line which offers nine types of implants that generate 102 possible variations , and another ‘ @entity105 ’ that has a further 219 variations			1
the @entity96 range offers another 270 different possibilities			1
boob jobs are the most popular form of plastic surgery , and the number of @entity0 operations rose by 13 per cent in the past year			0
consultant reconstructive surgeon @entity113 , of @entity114 , said : ‘ a few years ago the implant choice was around a finite number of volumes and a single shape			0
now i have a 20 - to 30 - page manual full of choices			0
’ mr @entity113 said there is now a generational divide with younger women wanting bigger breasts but older women on their second or third boob jobs seeking a more natural look			2
@entity128 , 31 , a fitness instructor from @entity129 in @entity130 , had her first augmentation ten years ago			0
she said : ‘ i just walked into the clinic and said , “ i want to be bigger , give me massive boobs ” – as you do when you ’re young			0
i went from a b cup to a @entity137 i loved it , but then i grew up and they started to really get in the way			0
now i ’m going for something much more natural			0
’ @entity142 , chief executive of @entity95 , said : ‘ a woman should be able to work with her surgeon to select the shape , volume and projection that most suits her individual wishes			2
