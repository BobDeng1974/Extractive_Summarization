you might have seen fantastic images of the sun before , or even clips showing its activity - but you ’ve never seen anything like this			2
an incredible video has stitched together footage from a @entity11 spacecraft , revealed the beauty of the solar surface as it bursts with energy			2
taken over five years , the footage includes plasma raining down on the sun , an extreme solar eruption and even a comet breezing through the sun ’s atmosphere			1
it was made by stitching together footage from @entity11 's @entity28 over five years the movie , called @entity30 , was created by filmmaker @entity22 from @entity23 , @entity21			1
it uses footage recorded by @entity11 ’s @entity28 ( @entity28 ) spacecraft between 2011 and 2015			2
‘ this montage features excerpts of @entity37 full - disk pictures in extreme ultraviolet channels , ’ explained mr @entity22 , and it ‘ offers a glance at spicules , solar flares , filaments and an overview of the sun ’s atmosphere			2
’ highlights of the video include large , bright tendrils extending outward from the sun ’s surface and occasionally crashing down again - known as solar prominences			2
other fantastic sections show bright , active regions on the sun ’s surface as magnetic fields send it into turmoil			0
transits of the moon , @entity60 and @entity61 across the sun , as observed from the @entity28 , are also seen , while towards the end of the video @entity63 can be seen passing the sun in december 2011			1
another incredible part of the video shows ‘ coronal rain ’ streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun ’s surface			1
coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun ’s atmosphere - cools and condenses in strong magnetic fields			1
the plasma is attracted to the magnetic fields and condenses , slowly falling back to the solar surface over several hours			0
@entity11 's @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , illustrated below , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since			1
it 's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around @entity61			0
by watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona , which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun , what heats the sun 's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface , and why the sun 's magnetic fields are constantly on the move			0
@entity28 also measures fluctuations in the sun 's extreme ultraviolet output , which provides the majority of energy for heating @entity61 's upper atmosphere			1
five years into its mission , @entity28 continues to send back tantalizing imagery to incite scientists ' curiosity			0
for example , in late 2014 , @entity28 captured imagery of the largest sun spots seen since 1995 as well as a torrent of intense solar flares			0
another incredible part of the video shows ‘ coronal rain ’ ( pictured ) streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun ’s surface			1
coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun ’s atmosphere - condenses and falls back to the surface elsewhere , solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( @entity134 ) are seen erupting on the sun ’s surface , sending out huge amounts of energy			1
cmes are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun , and they can pose a threat to satellites in @entity61 orbit			0
solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun , which are sometimes associated with @entity134 - although their connection is not well understood			0
the video , though , is a reminder of just how beautiful , powerful and active our solar system ’s only star can be			0

filmmaker @entity22 from @entity23 , @entity21 has created an amazing video showing solar activity
it was made by stitching together footage from @entity11 's @entity28 over five years
the footage includes loops of ' coronal rain ' showering the surface of the sun
transits of the moon , @entity60 and @entity61 are also seen - and a comet breezes through the outer solar atmosphere
