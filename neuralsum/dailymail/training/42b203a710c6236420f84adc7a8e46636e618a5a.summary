will @entity4 follow suit ? it 's a true test of modern family etiquette			1
just what do children call their grandfather ’s second wife ? step - gran does n’t exactly roll off the tongue , and a straightforward ‘ gran ’ has the potential to cause offence			1
but when it comes to little @entity4 , it seems as if the @entity1 might have the tricky issue cracked – with the unlikely name of @entity3			0
yesterday @entity21 revealed to the @entity22 that ‘ @entity3 ’ is what her own grandchildren call her			1
‘ i do n’t know if it ’s because they think i am , ’ she joked , ‘ but it is still very sweet			0

seeking shelter in the @entity43 tent , @entity21 chatted proudly about prince @entity44 and @entity46 ’s ‘ lovely ’ new addition to the family as she stocked up on £ 1.20 packets of chocolate buns			1
for many families in which parents are divorced or separated , the issue of what to call a step - grandparent can become a social minefield , sometimes causing bitter rifts – although clearly not here			2
the @entity1 made the revelation at the 132nd @entity30 at @entity59 in @entity31 @entity60 : the @entity1 quipped , ' i do n't know if it 's because they think i am ! ' asked what she had decided to call herself , @entity21 told the @entity22 : ‘ that ’s something we have got to have a think about			1
we have n’t decided yet			2
’ she continued , laughing : ‘ my own grandchildren call me @entity3			1
i do n’t know if it ’s because they think i am ! it is funny but is still very sweet			0
family : @entity72 has forged an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons , @entity44 and @entity75 ‘ we are all just about to go off on holiday together , there will be seven children in all			2
can you imagine ? it can be quite chaotic , but i just love having them around			0
’ @entity21 has five grandchildren under the age of five from the two children she had during her first marriage to brigadier @entity86			2
her son , @entity87 , has two children with his wife , @entity89 : @entity90 , five , and @entity91 , three			0
her daughter , @entity93 , and her husband @entity75 also have @entity95 , five , and twins @entity96 , three			0
although she was described as ‘ the rottweiler ’ by @entity44 ’s late mother @entity99 , friends say @entity21 is a warm and generous woman , who adores her growing family			2
she frequently chats happily about how the ‘ entire brood ’ regularly take over her private home in @entity102 at weekends			2
she has also managed to forge an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons , @entity44 and @entity75 , and was seen offering @entity46 some wifely advice over lunch shortly before her wedding			0
as his wife chatted about pet names , prince @entity29 was busy collecting gifts from well - wishers to be passed on to baby @entity4 , including teddy bears , babygros and books			0
@entity29 said : ‘ it ’s a wonderful feeling [ to be a grandfather ]			0
it ’s a very nice feeling , is n’t it ? ’ cute : the duchess is presented with some seeds by 22 - month - old @entity121 @entity46 , the @entity46 , carries her new born son , the prince of @entity40 , who may soon be calling his step - grandmother ' @entity60 ' long to reign over us : @entity46 and @entity44 pose for pictures with their new baby son , @entity4 he was clearly delighted to receive a teddy bear embroidered with @entity128 ’s name from 55 - year - old @entity129 , of @entity130 , asking : ‘ you did n’t put a bet on it did you ? ’ unfortunately not , she said			1
he also told @entity134 , 73 , herself a great - grandmother , that baby @entity128 was ‘ very sweet ’ but it was ‘ too early to say ’ who he looked like			1
‘ i think i am going to have to go on a babysitting course as it ’s a while since i have done this sort of thing , ’ he added .			0
