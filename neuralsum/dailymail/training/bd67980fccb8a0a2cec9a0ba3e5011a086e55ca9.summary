‘ my mother was dressed in her blue and white robe			0
her legs were splayed wide open and my father was straddling her , pummeling her with clenched fists			0
‘ @entity46 spurted from my mother ’s face			0
she started thrashing around , kicking her legs , holding up her arms to ward off the punches and trying to break free , trying to save herself			0
’ @entity6 ’s mom left the singer because she feared he might kill her			2
the never did n’t beat his children , but @entity6 writes that the ‘ damage had already been done ’ from growing up seeing what her mom was subjected to			2
@entity1 , pictured with @entity57 , was best known as the @entity1 , the @entity11 and the hardest working man in show - business prior to his death on christmas day 2006 ‘ i ’d been programmed to accept abuse as part of life … witnessing my father beating on my mother would have a profound effect on me			2
’ while working as a pharmacist at @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity6 met @entity68 , a six feet , five inches tall and 280 pound former baseball player turned investment banker			1
all seemed to be going well between the couple and @entity68 asked @entity6 ’s father for his daughter ’s hand in marriage after they ’d been dating for just two months			1

@entity6 writes that she regrets not walking away from the relationship after that first incident but instead ‘ i made the decision to stay with @entity68			1
’ instead she stayed with him for the next ten years during which she says she endured countless beatings			2
‘ it was n’t until a decade later , when i was lying on that cold tile floor , with my head pounding and my vision blurred from being punched in the face , that i finally saw my marriage with absolute clarity , and i knew it was over			0
