by @entity1 reporter workmen have been left looking rather red - faced after making this embarrassing mistake outside a primary school			1
these pictures show how council workmen somehow managed to spell ' school ' wrong outside @entity8 , near @entity9 , in @entity10			1
the no - parking road sign outside the tiny village primary is instead spelt ' sckool '			1
embarrassing : the workmen who wrote this no - parking sign outside @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , are hardly likely to get top marks for spelling accurate : the workmen at least managed to spell ' keep clear ' correctly the embarrassing mistake was spotted by an eagle - eyed photographer in the tiny village of @entity8 , which is on the @entity23 coast			1
it is to be hoped the sign is fixed before the tiny school 's 154 pupils return from their summer holidays			1
it is not the first time workmen have been left red - faced by embarrassing signs			2
residents in @entity33 , @entity34 , were left bemused last year when they woke up to discover bumbling workmen had somehow managed to misspell ' clear ' on a road sign - instead telling drivers to ' @entity38 '			2
the giant lettering , measuring a metre high , was painted across the entrance to a small @entity41			2
embarrassed council chiefs quickly ordered the sign to be repainted once the mistake was spotted			0
a spokesman from @entity46 blamed the incident on ' human error '			0
silly : it 's not clear how bumbling workmen got the spelling of this huge keep @entity52 sign quite so wrong oops ! this previous blunder in east @entity54 may be even more embarrassing road painters have previously misspelled a word in two - foot high neon yellow letters at a bus lane in @entity60 , east @entity54 , that marked out a ' @entity61 '			0
workers for @entity63 also managed to make a mistake in their bus stop road markings - instead writing ' @entity66 '			0
in front of @entity70 in @entity68 workmen also created the bold legend ' @entity72 '			0
that one lasted only a few days until painters returned to add the vital ' c ' .			0

school is spelt ' sckool ' outside @entity8 in @entity10
