by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 03:25 est , 4 may 2013 disgraced : @entity1 has been accused of giving his mansion to his wife to protect his fortune serial sex offender @entity1 has been accused of giving his mansion to his wife to protect his fortune from compensation claims made by his victims			1
the former it ’s a knockout presenter is being sued by at least six women in relation to harm and injuries they suffered at his hands			1
but the @entity13 can reveal that in the weeks before he admitted his guilty plea the 83 - year - old transferred the ownership of his £ 2million @entity18 mansion into the name of his wife			1
last night it was claimed the move could be an example of ‘ asset stripping ’ by the broadcaster to stop his victims from making claims against his fortune			1
@entity26 , a solicitor from @entity27 is representing more than 50 victims of @entity29 in their compensation claims against his estate and the @entity32			1
he is now representing six of @entity1 ’s victims who want to sue him for compensation			1
mr @entity26 is also considering taking action against the @entity32 on their behalf			1
he said : ‘ @entity1 ’s admission of guilt means we will be able to pursue these cases expeditiously on behalf of our clients			0
‘ victims often live with the memories of the abuse hidden away at the back of their minds for years and it is particularly brave of such victims to come forward and face those memories			2
’ but he condemned the fact @entity1 had transferred the ownership of his home before his admission of guilt			0
mr @entity26 said : ‘ we see this kind of cynical move all the time , it ’s really horrible			0
it is hugely problematic and it often happens in this sort of case			0
‘ victims have enough on their plate already having to deal with such a horrible personal tragedy and a criminal court case			2
home : @entity1 has been registered as the joint owner of his red brick mansion in @entity72 with his wife @entity73 , 75 , since at least 1981 ‘ then when they try to get their little bit of justice in the civil courts they find they are getting a second dose of injustice			1
’ @entity1 has been registered as the joint owner of his red brick mansion in @entity72 with his wife @entity73 , 75 , since at least 1981			1
but his name was removed from the title for the property registered at the @entity85 on february 22 , 2013 making @entity73 the sole owner			1
there is no mortgage listed on the property			0
only two weeks earlier @entity1 had protested his innocence to the allegations of sexual assault on the steps of @entity94			0
sign over : @entity1 pictured with his wife in 1979 then , just weeks after safely moving his property into the name of his wife , @entity1 changed his plea and said he was guilty of indecently assaulting 13 girls			2
mr @entity26 warned the change in ownership will make it difficult for his victims to make a financial claim against @entity1 because there is no guarantee he will be able to pay any compensation awarded			2
he said : ‘ very often we find houses being transferred , moneys being sent overseas , you name it and it ’s done			0
it ’s then very difficult to unravel because quite often we have to go to the @entity115 to get a freezing order to stop it			0
' the victims will have to convince a judge the money has been transferred simply to defeat a civil claim			2
’ he also warned there was very little victims could do to stop their abuser from securing their financial position until they have been found guilty in a criminal court			2
he said : ‘ victims are prevented from taking any action to protect their own positions because it might compromise any prosecution			1
' a common defence practice in criminal trials is of the defence to accuse the victim of making up allegations to try to get “ at my client ’s money ”			0
‘ mr @entity140 can often be given advice telling him that if he goes down he is probably going to get sued by the victims therefore it might be a good idea to “ arrange your affairs ”			2
‘ in this case the victims have a cast iron case to bring against @entity1 but if he has transferred all his assets he will turn around and say “ sorry , but i ca n’t pay you ”			2
’ @entity151 of @entity152 is representing another 50 victims of @entity154 in their claims for compensation against his estate and the @entity32			1
admission : @entity1 pictured outside court yesterday she said moving the ownership of a property into the name of a spouse makes it less attractive for solicitors to want to take up a civil claim			0
she added : ‘ if someone is suing a litigant in person it is normal that you would look into their means before you would make a decision whether or not to prosecute			0
‘ you have to make a very practical decision because whilst you might win you might never be able to enforce the judgement			0
’ according to friends , @entity1 ’s wife of 55 years , @entity73 , is standing ‘ rock solid ’ behind him			1
they say she is determined to protect her two children @entity182 , 52 , and @entity183 , 50 , and their four grandchildren			0
a source said : ‘ it ’s been tough on everyone but the family are being very supportive of him			0
’ in his biography @entity1 claims it was @entity73 who ‘ fell for ’ their home in @entity72 and he ‘ arranged a purchase on the spot ’			1
@entity1 ’s lawyers last night failed to respond to inquiries from the @entity13 about the home ownership transfer .			0
