people come and go for work in the factories nearby , but on the weekend it is just the rv - dwellers that area left @entity73 life : here @entity74 can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home , one of about 30 in the community eclectic : while @entity74 's rv is organized and functional , @entity23 's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years alongside him - most of the time - is @entity14 , 57			1
while some are forced to move about regularly , @entity14 , a maintenance man , looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot			1
his home has its own unique stamp on it			2
' he had really made the @entity6 his home and taken good care of it , ' @entity13 described			1
' it was more functional [ than @entity23 's ] and a cleaner space with a bed , kitchen and bathroom			0
' whether organized or eclectic , however , each one is home			0
' none of them seem to want to move on , ' @entity13 said			2
' it 's not perfect but they seem pretty content			0
move in , move out : some have agreements to stay , but others have to keep driving around to find a spot @entity23 works as a panhandler at @entity111 stadium , where he used to work as a cook he is content with his life in between the usual confines of society personal : to many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space ' @entity74 is very grateful , he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this			1
