by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 19 june 2013 for horticulturists it is a moment of great beauty tinged with even greater sadness			2
an exotic plant that flowers once in its lifetime before dying has bloomed			2
the spiky plant had shown no signs of blossoming for 11 years but has now burst into an array of turquoise petals with orange anthers - on what is expected to be the hottest day of the year			1
the bright colour combination is extremely rare to see in the plant world and is never seen on a plant native to the @entity18			0
the exotic bromeliad plant that only blooms once in its lifetime finally burst into flower today after 11 - year wait the flowers of the @entity23 are expected to last for around two weeks but it will sadly be the first and last time the 6ft tall plant blooms as they die shortly after the flowers fade			1
the plant - a bromeliad - is a relative of the pineapple and is native to the @entity32 in @entity33			2
it has been growing at the @entity35 on the @entity36 for the last 11 years			1
but today 's hot and humid temperatures set to hit @entity39 ( @entity38 ) appear to have encouraged it to flower			0
the attraction has over 20 species of @entity45 plants and around 50 of the stunning turquoise variety , however they will not all flower at the same time			0
the @entity23 , native to @entity49 , flowers once - for just a couple of weeks - and then dies normally the @entity23 requires extremely arid conditions to flourish and has waxy , silver coloured spines on its leaves to protect them against sunlight			1
however , it is a hardy species and can survive in cooler conditions if kept relatively dry			0
@entity57 , curator at the @entity35 , said : ' the @entity23 is a monocarpic plant which means it flowers just once and then dies			1
' it will be in flower for a couple of weeks and then hundreds of the seeds will be pollinated by birds , and only one or two of those will survive			0
@entity35 worker @entity66 is dwarfed by the flowers of the @entity23 ' the colour is an unusual combination , usually flowers are pollinated by flies who ca n't see the red spectrum , but birds can pick up the orange on the blue background			1
' the weather patterns are changing , we had a very wet year last year and it has also been very cold , so the weather might have something to do with it flowering now			0
' they are native to the @entity32 in @entity33 where conditions are very arid and the leaves are covered in a waxy substance to protect them			0
' the @entity23 can grow up to 10ft tall and last for 100 years before it flowers , we have had this particular one since 2002			1
' although they normally flower in the summertime it is a waiting game as you ca n't tell when they are going to			0

@entity23 blossomed today - likely to be the hottest day of 2013
has been growing at @entity35 for last 11 years
the plant can last for 100 years before flowering
