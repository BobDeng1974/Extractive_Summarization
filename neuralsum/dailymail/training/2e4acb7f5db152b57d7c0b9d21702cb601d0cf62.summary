by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 a tiny shack on the @entity4 where a 57 - year - old homeless man has lived for a year has today been ripped down by @entity7 police			1
a dozen officers wearing helmets and brandishing hammers raided the home on thursday morning and broke up the man 's coffin - sized shack , which he had built from flimsy wood			1
officers tore up the wood and pulled down his belongings , including pots , bedsheets , clothing and even electrical items , before dumping them in an overflowing truck			0
the man , who previously told @entity26 his name was @entity28 , was taken to the @entity29 in @entity30 , an @entity24 spokesman said today			2
he also refused any medical attention			0
for a year , the man had managed to quietly come and go from his home on the cyclists ' side of the @entity7 landmark , which connects @entity30 and @entity53			2
but his hideaway was discovered last month after a cyclist called 911 saying he thought the man was trying to commit suicide - when he was actually climbing into the safe confines of his tiny home			1
the @entity24 said that the home had to be demolished because it was dangerous for @entity28 and for those who use the cycle path of the bridge			2
@entity26 spoke to him at the home earlier this week and , speaking in heavily - accented @entity66 , he offered up his name as @entity28 and said that he arrived in @entity7 from @entity68 13 years ago			1
belongings : they pulled down his belongings and piled them high in trucks to be discarded @entity73 away : his items , including bedding and wood , filled a truck near to the @entity4 stash : the team of police officers pulled down his belongings on thursday , including electrical items when asked where he had lived in @entity68 before arriving in the @entity83 , middle - aged @entity28 said that he had worked in @entity84 , but had left to try and find a better life in the @entity83			1
claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling , @entity28 said that for the past year he had called the @entity4 his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby @entity92			1
indeed , dotted around the shack built into the bridge was evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area			2
@entity28 said that there were others who lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912			0
looking inside : an image shows the inside of the man 's home as officers continue to pull it down discovery : @entity116 workers help pull down the insides of the man 's home thrown away : they broke up the wood and pulled down bed sheets and pieces of carpet , pictured crowd : members of the @entity24 looked on as officers pulled down items on thursday morning surprisingly well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge , @entity28 said that the brutal winter that @entity7 and the nation just experienced was difficult to endure			1
he also said that he was working on a second shack just 15 - feet up the ramp from his current abode			0
each of the cramped homes were around ten feet - by - one - and - a - half feet and seemed to be protected with bike locks			0
the tiny , narrow dwellings were just big enough for one person to lie down			0
the living spaces also provided little silence as loud subway trains rumbled by on four different tracks , 24 hours a day			0
emerging : the man who lived in the shack said his name was @entity28			2
he is pictured by his home this week looking inside : water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where ' @entity28 ' built his home on the bridge daylight : earlier this week , ' @entity28 ' explained that he has been coming and going from the home for a year			1
but a passerby saw him climbing into the home and thought he was committing suicide , so called the cops heading home : ' @entity28 ' headed back to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining the spot was also poorly lit and well - trafficked with bikers who speed past , not expecting to see a pedestrian on this side of the bridge			1
@entity28 likely picked the spot because it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof			0
there is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway			0
last sunday a cyclist saw @entity28 climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper , calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide			1
the @entity24 declined to comment to @entity26 regarding the dwellings , and the @entity182 has yet to return a message left seeking comment			0
before : his home , only accessible by the cyclists ' lane , was snapped in daylight before it was pulled down secret : his home , seen above the cyclists ' lane , was accessed by climbing over the steel railings			0

on thursday morning , police officers ripped down the shack that ' @entity28 ' had built into the girders of @entity7 's @entity4
the man , 57 , who is originally from @entity68 , earlier this week said that he had built the home from items he found discarded in nearby @entity92
the shack was first uncovered last month when a cyclist thought @entity28 was attempting suicide - but instead he was just entering his home
it is *believed* that @entity28 has been taken to a nearby *community* center
