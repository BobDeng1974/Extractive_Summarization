by @entity1 medical correspondent published : 18:03 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 18:13 est , 9 september 2013 researchers found that when gefitinib is combined with medicine used to treat ectopic pregnancy the time needed to cure the condition can reduce by a third women who suffer an ectopic pregnancy could have their fertility saved by a lung cancer drug			1
the treatment should reduce the number who need surgery for the agonising condition , which can threaten their chances of having a baby in future			0
researchers found that when gefitinib – a drug commonly given to lung cancer patients – is combined with a medicine already used to treat ectopic pregnancy , the time needed to cure the problem is cut by one - third			1
an ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants before reaching the womb and starts to grow in one of the two fallopian tubes			1
it is often not diagnosed for several weeks , until symptoms develop into a medical emergency that can be life - threatening			0
some 12,000 women suffer an ectopic pregnancy each year in the @entity38			1
in the most serious cases , surgery is required , sometimes meaning the removal of a fallopian tube , making it more difficult for the woman to get pregnant again			0
on average , five women die each year as a result of an ectopic pregnancy – usually from massive loss of @entity50 per cent of cases , the drug methotrexate can be used successfully to remove the implanted egg			1
but research led by dr @entity54 at the @entity55 and dr @entity56 at the @entity57 shows the combination therapy using two drugs is much more effective			0
dr @entity54 said : ‘ we ’re very excited by the findings because it ’s a problem affecting thousands of women			0
‘ an ectopic pregnancy can be extremely stressful for the woman involved			1
‘ if we can reduce the need for surgery , and thereby help fertility levels , then that would be an enormous benefit			0
‘ reducing the treatment time for women who do not need surgery would also have a significant impact			2
’ in a study involving 12 women given conventional treatment for an ectopic , half had an additional seven - day course of gefitinib injections			2
@entity83 works by blocking a protein known to encourage cell growth which is found in high levels in ectopic tissue			2
the average time for the tissue to disintegrate was 21 days using the combination therapy compared with 32 days for the conventional drug alone			1
none of the women needed surgery , says the report published in the journal @entity95			0
dr @entity54 , who will now expand the study , said the main side - effect was a rash which disappeared when treatment ended			0
women said this would not deter them having treatment if it meant their fertility was less likely to be damaged , he said			0
a short course of gefitinib costs £ 490 but surgery costs at least £ 1,500 , with some women needing fertility treatment afterwards			0
chairman of @entity110 , who had emergency surgery for a misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancy , said : ‘ this is wonderful news			1
‘ ectopic pregnancy is both physically and emotionally traumatic , and women and their families have to come to terms with the loss of a baby , invasive surgery … and the loss of part of their fertility , all in a single experience			1
‘ if this can provide women with more treatment options and reduce their physical trauma , which in turn will lessen the emotional impact , then further study is applauded			2

combination of medicines could reduce time it takes to cure ectopic pregnancy by a third
@entity83 is a drug usually used to treat lung cancer
ectopic pregnancy kills five women every year on average in the @entity38
