by @entity0 published : 20:55 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 03:47 est , 5 november 2013 a @entity2 police force has become the first in the country to offer pensions for retired police dogs			2
crime - fighting canines will be rewarded with up to £ 1,500 each under the @entity9 scheme			1
previously , ex-police dogs received no contributions towards their upkeep and would be kept by their handlers as pets or rehomed			1
a new scheme in @entity16 will pay up to £ 1,500 for each retired police dog 's costs , because they are usually taken on by their handlers as pets the payouts will cover treatments for the highly - trained animals , including vet ’s bills , worming , vaccinations and kennel fees			1
police say they will pay a maximum of £ 500 per year for three years to cover the upkeep of retired animals			1
however the plans , which will be rolled out next month , have met with criticism from campaigners who say the money , which will total around £ 39,000 for the force ’s 26 police dogs , is a rough deal for taxpayers			1
six dogs retire from the police force every year after a career sniffing out drugs , bombs and searching properties asked what he made of such comments , @entity51 , police and crime commissioner for @entity16			1
police , said : ' i guess the criticism is , " well hang on a minute , we should spend the money elsewhere "			0
well , you ’ve got to make judgments about priorities			0
' he added : ' we look after the people who work for us who have been police officers and staff - they get a decent retirement and i think it ’s important the same is done for the dogs			2
' these animals work hard for the police and they are officers in their own right			0
' many of the force ’s dogs are fit and healthy when they retire but some need medical treatment for injury or illness resulting from being worked hard while tackling crime			1
' these dogs give willing and sterling service over the years in protecting the public so i am delighted to approve a scheme that will ensure continuing medical help once their work is done			1
' @entity89 pc @entity87 believes his dog @entity91 may have saved his life in a terrifying incident last november			2
the eight - year - old @entity95 shepherd / malinois cross leapt 8ft into the air to grab an axe from the hand of a man as @entity100 tried to arrest him in @entity102			2
@entity91 is expected to retire in the next 12 months or so after spending most of his life working for @entity104 and helping to make ' many hundreds ' of arrests			0
@entity100 said : ' i ’m really pleased and i think it ’s only right			0
as an organisation that works with animals we need to set an example			0
@entity51 , police and crime commissioner for @entity16			0
police , said he was ' concerned to learn ' dog pensions were n't already being offered ' with @entity91 by my side while i ’m tackling a suspect i almost ca n’t miss. i love him to bits , he looks after me			0
' around six police dogs retire every year after spending their lives assisting with arrests , crowd control , sniffing out drugs and searching properties			1
mr @entity51 said : ' let ’s be clear about it , if the officers did n’t look after the dogs when they retire from the force they would be put down			1
' the police officers have become very fond of the dogs , they keep the dogs , and i do n’t think it ’s fair that they have to pay all the bills			2
' @entity104 is the first force to offer an ‘ in - house ’ pension scheme for its retired canine officers			0
in 2009 , @entity139 announced it had set up a trust to fund a similar retirement plan for its dogs .			0

the £ 39,000 scheme is being *introduced* by @entity9
it will pay £ 500 per year for a maximum of three years for dog 's costs
six dogs retire every year and are usually taken on by their handlers
