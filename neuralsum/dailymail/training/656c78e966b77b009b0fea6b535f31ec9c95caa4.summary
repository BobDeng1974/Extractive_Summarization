@entity12 have solved the puzzle of @entity9 's nose , claiming it is to stop it freezing and to help with the exertion of delivering presents to good children around the globe			1
they say @entity9 's nose shines so brightly because it is richly supplied with red blood cells which help to protect it from freezing and to regulate brain temperature			1
@entity11 mission : this thermal imaging camera shows a reindeer 's nose glowing red like @entity9 's			1
a new study shows how a rich supply of blood vessels in reindeer noses helps them to regulate their temperature this superior ' nasal microcirculation ' is essential for pulling @entity40 's sleigh under extreme temperatures			1
tiny blood cells known as micro-vessels in the nose are vital for delivering oxygen , controlling inflammation , and regulating temperature , the scientists claim			2
@entity50 and @entity51 researchers knew how important this regulation is for flying reindeer , especially as they take to the skies from their frozen home near the @entity56			0
not just a song : a reindeer in the @entity50 @entity59 showing distinct pink colouration on its nose they set out to test whether @entity9 's famous red nose was due to ' a highly dense and rich nasal microcirculation ' compared with human noses			1
using a hand - held video microscope , they first assessed the noses of five healthy human volunteers and found a circulating blood vessel density of 15 mm / mm2			0
when the technique was applied to two reindeer noses , the researchers found a 25 per cent higher density of blood vessels , carrying a super-rich concentration of red blood cells			2
they also found a high density of mucous glands scattered throughout the reindeer noses , which they say helps ' maintain an optimal nasal climate during changing weather conditions and extremes of temperature as well as being responsible for fluid transport and acting as a barrier			0
' infrared thermal images showed that reindeer do indeed have red noses			0
professor can @entity92 said : ' the microcirculation of the nasal mucosa in reindeer is richly vascularised and 25 per cent denser than that in humans			0
' these factors explain why the nose of @entity9 , the lead flying reindeer employed by @entity40 to pull his sleigh , is red and well adapted to carrying out his duties in extreme temperatures			2
' the findings were published in the @entity106 .			0

study shows @entity9 's nose is shiny because it is richly supplied with blood vessels to protect it from freezing and regulate brain temperature
