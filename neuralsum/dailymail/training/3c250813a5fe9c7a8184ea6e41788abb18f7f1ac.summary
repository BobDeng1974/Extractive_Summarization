four - year - olds @entity13 and @entity15 and their two - year - old brother @entity16 were asleep as the blaze took hold in @entity19 , @entity20 , while elder brother @entity21 , 19 , was overcome by fumes as he went upstairs to try to rescue them			1
all four died from the effects of smoke inhalation from the blaze on january 7 last year			1
in july , @entity1 , 19 , was convicted of four counts of manslaughter by a jury at @entity30 , who found he had set fire to a bedroom wardrobe			1
a birthday party was being held for the children ’s mother , @entity35 , at the address in @entity38			0
heavy cannabis user @entity1 had spent the day drinking vodka and smoking cannabis from a bong			1
sentencing him to life , mr @entity43 said he had no motive to harm the children or anyone in the @entity48			2
he said : ' so why did you do it ? in one sense , what prompted you to do this terrible thing - not only starting a fire in a room where defenceless young children were asleep but waiting for several minutes before raising the alarm - is a mystery			1
' but in another sense , why you did it seems clear enough			0
it was because you were out of your head due to the lethal combination of alcohol and cannabis which you had taken that day and because of your fascination with fire , particularly when you are affected by drink or drugs			1
' the judge continued : ' if you had not been drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis , four young people would still be alive and several other lives would not have been blighted			1
' but although you were intoxicated , you were not so intoxicated that you did not know what you were doing			0
' while you did not intend to cause serious harm to the children , you knew what you were doing in starting the fire and you had ample experience of the danger of fire			1
' he said a life term was required because @entity1 was someone who poses a significant risk of harm to the public			1
' four - year - olds @entity13 and @entity15 and their two - year - old brother @entity16 were asleep as the blaze took hold @entity1 - who sobbed throughout the hearing - would only be released when he was no longer deemed a risk , he said			1
@entity1 was cleared of murdering the siblings			1
he denied all the charges and claimed it was not him who had started the fire			2
the defendant was the only other person who was upstairs at the dormer bungalow when the fire broke out , said the @entity103			2
@entity104 ( pictured ) died as he tried to save his twin sisters and little brother the fatal fire took hold from hanging clothes in a wardrobe in the bedroom shared by the three young children and their mother			1
three family friends were also in the house with the defendant who was a friend of another of ms @entity15 ’s sons			0
@entity1 was a regular visitor and stayed overnight the evening before the blaze , the jury was told			1
he spent most of the night on january 7 in the second upstairs bedroom , according to those who were in the house , said prosecutor @entity124			0
ms @entity15 , 37 , said she said remembered the lights going off and then the defendant jumped down the stairs and shouted ' @entity128 ' before he ran through the kitchen and out of the back door			0
ms @entity15 told police that smoke alarms had been fitted at the top and bottom of the stairs but @entity21 had taken them down in the days before the fire because one or both of them kept making beeping noises			1
mr @entity140 told the jury that several ' extremely detailed investigations ' had taken place into the cause of the fire and the unanimous view of the experts was that it was started deliberately			2
one expert concluded the fire started in the hanging clothes in the wardrobe , and the most likely source of ignition was a naked flame			2
giving evidence , @entity1 admitted his involvement in starting a locker fire when he was a pupil at his former high school and also setting fire to a local field			1
but he denied claims that he sprayed flaming aerosols at a house party in march 2011			0
mr @entity43 said he had not grown out of a history of playing with fires			0
he said he was satisfied that under the influence of drugs and drink he did terrorise teenage girls at the 2011 party with his makeshift ' flame thrower '			1
and the week before the deaths he lit an aerosol spray at the house in @entity38			0
the judge said @entity1 left the bedroom and waited for the fire to take hold			1
the scene of the housefire in which four siblings died			2
following detailed investigations ' into the cause of the fire , experts agreed that it was started deliberately he only came down the stairs to raise the alarm when the intense heat melted the aluminium light fitting and caused the electricity in the house to fail			1
' the fire had awoken the three children , ' said mr @entity197			2
' they could be heard calling for their mother			0
' one of the twins , @entity201 , stood on the molten carpet and suffered what must have been agonising burns to her feet			0
' but in the dark and the heat and the smoke the frightened children were unable to find their way out of the bedroom and all attempts to rescue them were beaten back due to the smoke			2
' he told @entity1 he had lied repeatedly to the police and in court , and also in his evidence had tried to shift the blame on to a young girl with a troubled background who was also at the party			1
he accepted that @entity1 regretted the deaths but added that ' remorse is to be judged by your conduct as a whole , including the many lies you told in an attempt to save your own skin with no apparent sense of shame '			2
' this is a factor to which i can give very limited weight , ' he said			0
four - year - old @entity13 and @entity15 's bedroom where @entity1 started the fire which killed them and their two brothers the charred remains of clothes recovered from the children 's room @entity1 's propensity to play with fire was fuelled by drink and drugs , mr @entity43 continued			1
' but you have failed completely to recognise the dangerous nature of such conduct which , when you are drunk or drugged , you regard as funny or as a kind of party trick			0
' i do not accept that there is now little or no risk because you have learned your lesson			2
' if you were going to learn a lesson , it might have been expected that you would do so long ago when on one occasion you injured yourself as a result of your games with fire			0
but you did not learn then and your games continued			0
' the judge said many of the witnesses present in the house were either drunk or stoned which ' presented obvious challenges '			0
but he said the ' meticulous and highly professional work ' of @entity128 had left no doubt the fire was started deliberately and without that it was doubtful whether @entity1 would have been brought to justice			1
@entity277 , defending , said his client was ' industrious ' until he started taking cannabis in his mid-teens			0
the drug use ' took its toll ' and he lost his job as an apprentice mechanic			0
he said it may be concluded that the deaths would not have happened if the defendant had not consumed cannabis on the night of the fire			2
' this was , and remains , an entirely motiveless offence , ' he said			0
' no - one on either side can identify any motive at all			0
' there had been no bad blood between @entity1 and the @entity48			2
' we say the taking of drugs explains but does not excuse these offences			0
' @entity1 maintains his innocence , but a psychiatrist who saw him as part of his pre-sentence report had noted that cannabis use could ' completely erase ' events from memory			1
mr @entity307 said the defendant came from ' a broken and , it may be thought , dysfunctional home '			0
he had never known his father and was not close with his mother			0
@entity1 had been staying temporarily at the @entity15 house at the time of the fire after he had a row with his grandmother about his cannabis use			1
' he got on well with the whole of the @entity48 , ' said his barrister			0
' he was personally very happy there			0
