@entity1 , alleged leader of the 1st @entity2 , the gang set up and then taken down by undercover agents police set up a neo-nazi motorcycle gang to snare white supremacists and racist bikers , including one who allegedly offered a $ 1,000 reward to anyone willing to murder a black man			1
after a five - year undercover investigation , prosecutors in @entity13 , @entity14 , believe they have been able to topple two domestic terrorism groups who were planning attacks on @entity20 soil			1
the probe - involving informants , hidden cameras and microphones , as well as undercover agents - revealed a subculture of @entity28 activists who were training and equipping themselves for a race war			1
fourteen members of a white supremacist group and five members of a racist biker gang have since been charged with offences ranging from drug trafficking to participating in paramilitary training			1
' the underlying aspect through all of it was that they were obtaining explosives and explosives expertise , and they intended to use them to kill people in the @entity20 , ' @entity38 - @entity13 state attorney @entity37 told the @entity47			0
the original investigation began in 2007 , with an agent from the @entity51 trading emails with @entity52 , a leader of the @entity53 hate group			2
once one of the country 's leading white - supremacist groups , the @entity53 , who believe the ' white race ' to be an ' endangered species ' , had been in decline since 2004 after founder @entity63 's death and lawsuits by the @entity65 which had depleted its funds			1
@entity67 wanted to form a neo-nazi biker club which would serve as the paramilitary arm of white supremacists across the @entity20 , according to records seen by the @entity47			0
following the email exchange , an undercover agent from @entity38 became the @entity53 ' top @entity14 recruiter for what would become the 1st @entity2			1
early members of the gang included two undercover @entity79 agents , who used their knowledge of explosives to gain the trust of others , and a biker who allegedly offered $ 1,000 to anyone who shot a black man riding an atv in rural @entity13 , according to records seen by the @entity47			1
@entity52 came to @entity14 in 2008 to meet his new followers after @entity1 , a 6ft 6in enforcer with the @entity89 , became the @entity91 's new ' fuhrer '			2
a cctv feed from @entity79 hidden cameras in the @entity95 clubhouse , which was used to gather evidence against members of the group the investigation into the group underway , the @entity99 installed a range of bugs and hidden cameras into the @entity95 's clubhouse in @entity106 , @entity13 , allowing them to begin collecting the evidence they would use to snare any members suspected of illegal activity			1
unaware of the covert recording equipment tracking his every move , @entity1 warned members to be wary of anti-terrorist legislation like the post 9/11 @entity116 , which gave police extensive surveillance powers , and to never admit their membership of the @entity120			0
however , @entity1 never suspected that his own in - house explosives experts were in fact undercover agents and he asked them repeatedly to build bombs and hand grenades for planned attacks , records show			2
and footage obtained from the many cameras concealed in the @entity95 clubhouse enabled officers to gather the evidence to put together drug - trafficking charges to arrest members			2
a still from @entity135 footage of @entity120 members apparently carrying out a cash transaction : three members of the gang now face drug trafficking charges the investigation broadened in the spring of 2010 when central @entity14 's @entity141 began looking at the @entity142 , another white supremacist group rumoured to be conducting paramilitary training in @entity13 in preparation for a race war			1
with no undercover officers inside that organisation , the investigation relied on a former drug dealer who had turned over to act as a confidential informant for the authorities			0
by late summer 2010 , he began hanging out at the 10 - acre @entity142 compound in @entity156 , owned by the group 's alleged leader @entity157 , where he joined members shooting @entity162 at water - filled jugs which represented the heads of blacks and @entity166			2
among a range of racist behaviour , the informant told how @entity157 traded a motorcycle for a plot of land where a young black man had been killed , burned and buried in 2010 in a racist murder unconnected to the @entity142 or its members			1
members of the gang used the murdered man 's desecrated grave as a urinal , records show			1
paramilitary training : a still taken from hidden camera footage shows a member of the @entity142 firing an @entity162 at their @entity13 compound armed and dangerous : a member of the @entity142 brandishes an @entity162			0
the group were thought to be in training for a hoped - for future race war the informant continued passing information to authorities until this may when , fearing his cover was blown and his life in danger , he dialled 911 while in a @entity197 cinema where he had gone with @entity142 members			1
arrests of 14 members of the group began then and continued through june			0
following their arrests mr @entity37 and @entity204 , an @entity38 deputy sheriff assigned to the @entity206 who was the lead agent in both investigations , both received death threats			0
almost all the 14 arrested members of the @entity142 were initially held in lieu of $ 500,000 bail on charges of participating in paramilitary training evidencing prejudice and planning to shoot into an unidentified building , according to the @entity47			2
racist ideology : fourteen members of the @entity142 were arrested and charged in may and june this year the investigation into the @entity120 continued until march 29 this year , but law - enforcement agencies have kept back much information about the group 's activities for the past two years			1
the @entity79 told the @entity47 it would not comment while cases remain in court			0
while six people were initially arrested in connection with the case , charges against one were subsequently dropped			0
three of the four remaining members arrested face bomb and drug - trafficking charges while would carry mandatory sentences of 25 years in prison if convicted			0
the fourth @entity120 arrestee faces bomb charges and a charge of solicitation to commit first - degree murder			0
' we decided to strike against the @entity120 by bringing these heavy - duty drug charges to shut the active members down , ' assistant state attorney @entity241 told the @entity47			0
