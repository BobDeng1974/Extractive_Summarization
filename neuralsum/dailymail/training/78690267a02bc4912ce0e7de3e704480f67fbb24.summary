by @entity1 reporter published : 00:24 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 10:25 est , 11 october 2013 controversy : archbishop @entity3 has apologised for his comments appearing to blame divorce for paedophilia the top @entity8 bishop in @entity9 has apologised for blaming divorce for encouraging paedophilia in comments that the church have described as ' a slip of the tongue '			1
archbishop @entity3 sparked outrage when he said earlier this week that sex abuse was the result of people ' looking for love ' , and appeared to suggest that divorce could be just as harmful to children as paedophilia			1
but he has since apologised for the anger caused by his comments and claimed that they were taken out of context			2
after his comments sparked fury among @entity9 social media users , the episcopate called a press conference in a bid to try and calm the situation			2
his spokesman said that his comments had been a ' pure slip of the tongue '			0
archbishop @entity3 added : ' the context of my comment was as follows : " a child is always innocent			1
but it can be hurt not only by priests but also by its own environment "			0
' his initial comments came as @entity9 's @entity47 faces mounting allegations of priests sexually abusing children			1
' many of these cases of molestation could be avoided given a healthy relationship between parents , ' archbishop @entity3 had told the @entity56 news agency			1
' we often hear that this inappropriate attitude [ i.e. paedophilia ] , or abuse , manifests itself when a child is looking for love			2
' it clings , it searches			0
it gets lost itself and then draws another person into this			0
' while condemning paedophile priests ' whom neither the @entity69 nor anyone else can accept , ' the cleric also spoke out against divorce as being harmful to children			1
' how many wounds are their in children 's hearts , in children 's lives , when their parents go their separate ways , ' he said			0
' today nobody talks about divorce doing great harm to a child			0
it 's obvious that sex abuse does great harm , one ca n't forget about it , but it 's not the only thing			2
' in an unprecedented move , @entity9 church leaders apologised earlier this month for the actions of alleged paedophile priests , as prosecutors began probes against two high - profile suspects			2
archbishop @entity94 , a 65 - year - old pole who served as a papal envoy in the @entity96 for five years , is being investigated for allegedly having sex with teenage boys			0
while condemning paedophile priests ' whom neither the @entity69 nor anyone else can accept , ' the cleric also spoke out against divorce as being harmful to children authorities in the @entity105 country are also investigating @entity106 , a 36 - year - old priest suspected of raping several young boys while serving there			1
@entity106 told @entity9 media last week the allegations were fabricated , claiming that @entity96 drug gangs were trying to frame him			0
despite the apology , @entity69 leaders in @entity9 insist they will not be offering victims any material compensation			0
unlike in countries such as the @entity117 and @entity118 , child sex abuse by priests in @entity9 has been a largely taboo subject and has so far not provoked widespread public outcry .			1

archbishop @entity3 said his comments were taken out of context
he had said that sex abuse was the result of people ' looking for love '
he claimed that divorce can be as harmful to children as paedophilia
