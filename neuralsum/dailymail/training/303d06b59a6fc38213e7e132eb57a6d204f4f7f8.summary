19 kids and counting stars @entity2 and @entity3 are reported to be in the midst of a bitter fight , after it was revealed that mother - to - be @entity8 , 23 , had unfollowed her younger sister - and her new husband @entity10 - on @entity11			1
according to @entity13 , @entity8 , who is expecting her first child , a son , with husband @entity17 in march , is linked with all of her other @entity11 - using family members , however @entity2 and @entity10 's accounts are noticeably absent from her 16 - strong follow list , which also includes @entity20 and @entity21			1
it seems the resentment might not be mutual however ; newly - wed @entity2 follows both @entity8 and @entity17 , who is also listed as one of her followers			2
while the reason behind the feud is not known , it is thought that the feud could have something to do with the girls ' respective engagements and wedding ceremonies being so close together - and it has been speculated that @entity2 felt her courtship with @entity10 was slightly overshadowed by the announcement of @entity8 's pregnancy			1
and it is not the first time that rumors of tension between @entity2 and her siblings have surfaced			2
earlier this year , eldest @entity32 daughter @entity67 , 24 , revealed in the family 's tell - all biography growing up @entity32 : it â€™s all about relationships that she and @entity2 regularly fought throughout much of their childhood			1
according to @entity67 , her parents @entity37 and @entity39 tried to end the sisters ' constant fighting by making them share a bunk bed , which only resulted in @entity2 continuing to torment her sibling by kicking her bunk every night and then laughing when she became upset			1
@entity11 spat : @entity2 's @entity11 account is noticeably absent from her sister 's 16 - strong follow list wedded bliss : @entity2 married @entity10 ( pictured toghether , right ) on november 1 , while @entity8 and @entity17 ( pictured together , left ) wed in june but while @entity2 and and @entity67 seem to have repaired their relationship , it remains to be seen whether the same will be said of @entity2 and @entity8 and their husbands , both of whom were welcomed into the family fold by patriarch @entity37 earlier this year			1
in june , @entity8 married 25 - year - old accountant @entity17 , sharing her first kiss with her new husband in front of 1,000 of their closest friends and family members during the ceremony , which was later broadcast in a special episode of @entity32			1
' it was so cute - i thought @entity8 almost dove right into the moment , ' the @entity32 matriarch @entity39 later said of the couple 's first kiss			0
' i was really surprised , but on the other hand , i 'm not			0
i just think @entity8 is quite the enthusiastic person			0
' interestingly , @entity2 , who wed 19 - year - old @entity10 on november 1 , chose to wait until after the ceremony before enjoying her first kiss with her new husband so the couple could share the moment in private			1
' they wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private , ' pastor @entity110 told people			0
' it was important to the both of them			0
' smiling sisters : the @entity32 siblings are thought to be incredibly close big brood : @entity37 and @entity32 have 19 children and have admitted they would be open to having more in the future when it came to preparing for their special days , mother @entity39 revealed on her blog that both sisters received huge amounts of support from their siblings			1

it 's a joyful time , ' she explained			0
' [ @entity37 ] is so excited , too , for @entity17 and @entity8 , and for @entity10 and @entity2			2
