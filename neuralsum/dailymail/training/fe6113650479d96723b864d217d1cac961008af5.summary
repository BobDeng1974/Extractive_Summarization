@entity0 is considering asking @entity1 to give @entity2 one - on - one coaching to ensure his finishing gets even better			1

@entity1 , pictured in 1996 , scored goals for fun during his time at @entity14 and @entity7 ‘ i have spoken to @entity2 and said that @entity1 and i have chatted about him			1
if i feel @entity2 could do with a little bit of extra help , i might well ( ask @entity1 to help out )			2
