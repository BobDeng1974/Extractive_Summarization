it is a measure of what @entity1 is achieving at @entity3 that when they beat @entity5 on wednesday night it was their third consecutive derby win and it is the first time they have managed that in 65 years			1
this is the club that went 14 years without beating their richer capital rivals			2
@entity11 had never beaten @entity5 before but then he had never tried with @entity1 on the touchline barking orders , conducting the crowd , celebrating with son @entity15 who was ball - boy for the night			1
@entity3 ’s manic manager can do no wrong			1
he watches @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 leave for @entity21 in the summer – no problem , he just builds another indestructible side			2
he rests key players because he knows he has @entity32 away on sunday – no problem , the @entity30 defender @entity24 , previously out of favour @entity25 , and second choice keeper @entity28 all do fine			2
@entity3 manager @entity1 issues instructions from the sidelines at the @entity37 stadium @entity1 embraces @entity5 boss @entity38 before their sides clashed on wednesday night he brings back 30 - year - old @entity41 – no problem he runs around for an hour like a 21 - year			1
@entity1 could probably bring back @entity43 and @entity44 and that would work out too			1
how does he do it ? there is an energy and an intensity about the man that transmits to his team but it would be doing him a disservice to reduce the magic to fist waving and shouting			0
@entity1 ’s teams are very difficult to beat			1
the well drilled defence is protected by a wall of four tireless midfielders and often one of the front two			0
they press in packs when they have to take the game to the opposition and they defend deeply and impenetrably when they have the lead			2
@entity1 's youngest son @entity68 ca n't hide his joy after @entity3 take the lead on wednesday @entity1 hugs his son after his @entity3 side doubled their lead in the last 16 of the @entity74 the @entity75 is also the master of setting the agenda			1
last season he repeated his ‘ one game at a time ’ mantra to such an extent that the huge pressure on the team – mounting as they came ever closer to what at the start of the season looked like an impossible league title – shifted to the coach and his obsession with this @entity89			0
he regularly used @entity92 - style ‘ little - horse ’ kidology in that monumental battle with @entity32 and @entity5 and it was both more believable and more effective			1
and like @entity92 he has a strong team around him with @entity97 , his former @entity3 team - mate is his loyal number two , and @entity100 is the fitness coach who drives that intensity in training that @entity1 demands during games			1
@entity3 's @entity106 wheels away after opening the scoring with a second - half penalty on wednesday there is a togetherness created by the coach that carries @entity3 clear of the more divided dressing rooms at the bigger wealthier clubs			1
his preference for players to all eat around a big table rather than in cliques at various tables , and his tactic of speaking to them individually before they turn in for the night before games – almost as if he wants them to dream those final match day instructions play a part in his very particular method			0
he says he is still learning and improving			0
he perhaps let his heart rule his head in last year ’s @entity132 final by playing @entity19 from the start only to have to substitute him injured			0
and he then lost his head , taking to the pitch in the second half after the ball was kicked in his direction			0
but even the weaknesses add to the legend because they are born of his passion for winning			0
the former @entity142 international , talking to an official , is regularly animated on the touchline would he win elsewhere should he move on ? the communion he has with the supporters as a former player and captain would be hard to replicate and part of his success in @entity153 comes from @entity3 being a physical force that teams in the @entity156 might be more able to cope with than some sides in @entity158			1
but it would be fascinating finding out			0
his @entity161 is limited but he is driven enough to change that if the right opportunity came along			0
for the time being it ’s difficult to see how anyone would be able to tempt him away from the team he is building on the banks of the @entity170			0
@entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 are all very young players – the basis is there for the team to keep moving forward at least until 2017 when @entity1 ’s contract runs out			1
the @entity75 national job would be the obvious next step			0
but the cue of @entity156 owners making sure things do not follow a logical path gets that little bit longer ever time his side turns over a @entity153 superpower in front of a global audience			2
@entity5 last night … @entity32 up next on sunday .			2

@entity3 beat city rivals @entity5 2 - 0 in the @entity74
@entity106 and @entity194 struck for last 16 first - leg lead
@entity1 celebrated both goals by embracing his youngest son
@entity1 's side are one point off @entity5 at the top of @entity158
the former @entity142 international 's contract runs out in 2017
