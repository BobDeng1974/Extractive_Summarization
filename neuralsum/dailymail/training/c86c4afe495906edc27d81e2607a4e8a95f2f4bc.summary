the town of @entity1 , @entity2 , usually heralds the start of the festive season with an impressive display of lights			1
flashing signs , shooting stars and illuminated snowmen are strung from lampposts in the town centre - bringing residents the first twinkles of @entity14			1
but this year the town has been forced to abandon its traditional display after being told it needed to spend £ 2,000 to make sure it passed the council 's health and safety checks			1
hard to see : this year the displays in @entity1 , @entity2 , have been replaced with fairy lights wrapped around lampposts traditional : the streets , seen here in 2005 , are usually decorated with bright festive lights local councillors were told by @entity29 they would have to stress - test each lamppost to prove they could safely bear the weight of the lights			1
but officials said that they could not afford to pay for the tests , which cost £ 60 per post			1
instead they removed strips of led lights from inside their stock of decorations and wrapped them around lampposts in the town - leaving residents with a display lacking in festive cheer			1
@entity46 , who has lived in the town for almost 30 years , said : ' i was so shocked when i saw them			0
when it 's dark they light up a little bit but otherwise they are not noticeable			0
' they are extremely underwhelming			0
it 's disappointing that the council did n't consult us first			0
' mr @entity46 , who is standing as a prospective town councillor in the first by - election in 20 years , added : ' i was shocked when i saw the lights being put up on sunday			2
scrapped : health and safety rules mean the town had to get rid of their cheerful designs , left , in favour of muted lights ( right ) ' i thought they were going to be in addition to the usual lights that we have , but then i was told that was it for @entity1 and no more would be going up			1
' people have been walking past and just shaking their heads , it 's just unbelievable			0
they are not very festive at all			2
' former mayor @entity76 , now a district councillor for @entity78 , was surprised that @entity79 had insisted on the stress testing			2
he said : ' they said these poles tend to rust easily so need to be tested , but i have n't seen any fall down yet			0
festive spirit : in this photo taken in 2005 , the town centre is brought to life with colourful @entity14 lights proud : residents mark the switching on of the @entity14 lights in 2009 with a walk through the town ' it will be a shame but we just ca n't afford it			1
with 30 poles it would have been very expensive to stress test each one			1
' we will have to concentrate on the lights in and around the clock tower and triangle this year instead			0
' town council clerk @entity100 added that they plan to make up for the poor lighting with a better display in the town centre			0
she said : ' the council considered all options , but as the budget is set , there was no extra funding available			0
@entity14 cheer : residents are disappointed that the council have not put up the traditional display of lights ' it was agreed to try this scheme for this year to see how effective it is , and to consider any changes when discussing the budget again in january			1
' @entity120 , street lighting manager at the @entity79 , defended the decision to insist on stress testing			0
he said : ' @entity123 is more than welcome to install @entity14 displays on street lights			2
' however , last year we found that one of the street lights that a display was installed on was corroded			0
' with the added weight of the decoration , this was extremely dangerous and could have caused a serious accident			0
' following last year 's discovery , it 's vital that we make sure all our street lights are safe to support any additional weight and we 've been speaking to the town council for several months to arrange to test the lights they want to use			2
' @entity145 chairwoman @entity144 added : ' here we go again , the season of @entity14 health and safety myths is upon us			1
' it is nonsense to suggest that lampposts need to be " stress tested " before fairy lights can be put up			1
' one can only guess at the real reason behind this silly decision but it 's not about health and safety			2

@entity1 , @entity2 is usually lit with eye - catching festive lights
the signs and decorations are normally *attached* to *33* lampposts
but local councillors were told they needed to stress test each post
they could not afford to spend £ 2,000 on the health and safety checks
instead single *strands* of fairy lights have been tied to lampposts
@entity145 : ' it is nonsense to suggest that lampposts need to be " stress tested " before fairy lights can be put up '
have you seen @entity14 lights that are worse than the ones in @entity1 ? if so , please email *stephanie.linning@mailonline.co.uk*
