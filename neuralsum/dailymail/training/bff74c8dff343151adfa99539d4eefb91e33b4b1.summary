by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:52 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 04:42 est , 22 january 2013 more people would vote to stay in the @entity3 than exit for the first time since @entity6 became prime minister			1
@entity8 today announced mr @entity6 will deliver his long - awaited and much - trailed speech on @entity11 ’s ’ @entity3 membership on wednesday			1
he is expected to promise a referendum on severing ties with @entity14			0
as the debate about @entity18 rages , a new opinion poll shows that the number of voters who want to remain part of the @entity3 has suddenly overtaken those calling for withdrawal			1
in - out question : for the first time since @entity6 became @entity7 more people would vote to stay in the @entity3 than leave , according to a series of opinion polls by @entity28 in the latest @entity28 survey , people were asked how they would vote if there was a referendum on @entity11 's membership of the @entity3			1
forty per cent of people said they would vote to remain while 34 per cent would vote to leave , according to the poll carried out on january 17 and 18			1
it is a dramatic reversal of opinion since november last year when 51 per cent said they would back withdrawal while just 30 per cent wanted to stay in			0
the shift in public attitudes to @entity14 comes after months of speculation about mr @entity6 ’s long - awaited speech on how he wants to claw back powers to @entity44			1
it suggests the widespread public debate has focused the minds of voters on the merits of remaining in the @entity3			0
mr @entity6 today met @entity51 prime minister @entity50 in @entity8 and briefed him on his long - awaited @entity18 speech @entity54 's lead over the @entity55 has been slashed to just five points , according to an @entity58 poll released today			1
the survey for @entity60 put @entity62 's party on 38 per cent ( down two points since a similar poll last month ) , @entity6 's @entity64 on 33 per cent ( up one ) , with @entity66 's @entity65 on 15 per cent ( up two ) and the @entity11 @entity67 on 6 per cent ( down one )			1
@entity54 's advantage is the narrowest recorded by @entity58 since august last year , and follows a period in which the party has consistently racked up double - digit leads over the conservatives			1
it is likely to spark speculation that mr @entity6 's standing has been boosted by his handling of the crises in @entity79 and @entity80 and by reports he is planning to offer an in / out referendum on future @entity11 membership of the @entity3			1
( @entity58 interviewed 1,001 adults between january 18 and 20			0
) @entity28 's @entity85 said : ' as always with sharp movements in public attitudes , we shall not know for some time whether we are seeing a blip or a trend			2
' @entity11 and the @entity3 has been the top domestic political news story for the past fortnight			0
maybe , when it recedes from the headlines , views about the @entity3 will revert to their normal " peacetime " default position in which the centre of gravity lies somewhere between scepticism and hostility			0
' last week a separate @entity28 survey showed half of people would vote to stay in the @entity3 if mr @entity6 succeeds in negotiating a new relationship , repatriating powers to @entity105			1
he had been due to deliver the speech in @entity107 on friday but it was called off at the last moment as the pm reacted to the @entity79 hostage crisis			1
he will instead deliver it in central @entity44 on wednesday morning			2
however , extracts released in advance showed how he will use the speech to warn @entity3 leaders that @entity11 could leave the 27 - nation bloc if three key concerns are not resolved			1
and there is growing speculation that he will announce an in / out referendum to be held after the 2015 general election , but rule out legislation during this parliament			0
mr @entity6 today briefly met @entity51 prime minister @entity50 in @entity8 , and was expected to brief him on the contents of the speech			1
he has already spoken to @entity18 leaders including @entity128 ’s @entity127 , @entity130 president @entity129 and @entity132 pm @entity131			2
when mr @entity6 outlined his plans to @entity136 on thursday night the @entity134 president warned @entity11 must remain part of a ' strong @entity3 '			2
the @entity134 president used a call to @entity44 to stress the @entity3 's role in spreading ' peace , prosperity , and security ' around the world			2
@entity8 was forced to deny a rift , insisting the call was ' friendly '			0
the survey will be a welcome boost to mr @entity6 on the eve of his speech when he is expected to promise voters a say on continuing to remain part of the @entity3 mr @entity6 will use his speech to warn that @entity11 could ‘ drift towards the exit ’ from the @entity3 unless there is real change in @entity14			1
he identified the crisis in the eurozone , the challenge of economic competitiveness and the issue of democratic legitimacy as key issues which must be resolved in negotiations on the future shape of the @entity3			2
asked why mr @entity6 would now be delivering his speech in @entity44 , his spokesman said : ‘ we were planning to give it in @entity107			1
unfortunately , that did n't prove possible and wednesday morning in @entity44 fits better with the prime minister 's schedule			1
’ the spokesman added : ‘ there is a debate going on across the @entity3			0
there is also an active debate going on here in the @entity11			0
the prime minister 's speech will be reflecting both those aspects			1
’ former defence secretary @entity180 ( left ) and communities secretary @entity181 have both seen mr @entity6 's speech and given it their backing communities secretary @entity181 said today he had seen mr @entity6 's speech and was ‘ very happy ’ with its content			2
asked whether the prime minister could quell unrest over @entity18 among his backbenchers , mr @entity181 said : ‘ i think so			1
i think there is a willingness and a desire to come together			0
’ earlier this month , mr @entity181 said he hoped @entity11 could remain a member of the @entity3 , but suggested it should not do so ‘ at any price ’			2
former defence secretary @entity180 , a leading @entity196 , said yesterday that he was ‘ broadly satisfied ’ with what he has been told			0
‘ if that is the speech that is finally delivered , a great many of us will think that it 's a speech that we 've been waiting a long time for any prime minister to deliver			1
’ @entity54 's @entity203 , the shadow foreign secretary , said : we understand and support the prime minister ’s decision to cancel his speech on friday because of unfolding events in @entity79			1
' the truth is the reason this speech has now been delayed for over 6 months is because @entity6 simply does n’t know what to say			2
' the gap between what his backbenchers demand and what the country needs has literally left him speechless , stranded between national and party interest			0
' @entity6 said it was vital @entity11 never forgets the events of the @entity220 as he signed a memorial book to commemorate the lives of those killed in the genocide			0
the prime minister met @entity227 survivor @entity226 , 89 , who said future generations should continue to honour those who died at the hands of the @entity231			2
mrs @entity226 , from @entity232 in @entity130 , has previously spoken of how she was separated from her mother for the final time by dr @entity235 , dubbed the @entity236 of @entity227			0
@entity6 signs the book of commitment ahead of @entity238 as @entity220 survivor @entity226 looks on mr @entity6 wrote : ' we commemorate the lives lost in the @entity220 and think also of those killed more recently in @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246			0
' today , mr @entity6 said : ' it must be very harrowing to bring all those memories back			0
' mrs @entity226 replied : ' it is very necessary			0
we must remember and we must never forget what happened			0
' they were joined in @entity8 by representatives of the @entity254 , which works to raise understanding of the atrocity			0
in a note to the @entity254 at the front of the memorial book , mr @entity6 wrote : ' your work is absolutely vital in making sure that we always remember what happened in the @entity220 - and that we never stop learning the lessons			2
' we commemorate the lives lost in the @entity220 and think also of those killed more recently in @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 and @entity246			0
' the tragedy is that so many did suffer from persecution and prejudice , but your work will make sure we never give up this fight and build a better world			0
