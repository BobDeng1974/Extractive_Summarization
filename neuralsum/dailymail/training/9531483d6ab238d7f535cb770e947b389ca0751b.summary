the committee , chaired by @entity2 mp @entity1 , is to publish its report on the future of the @entity5 , reportedly to be released within the next few weeks			1
its members are thought to be concerned over governance failures at the organisation and are largely in favour of replacing it with a board of directors , headed by a single chairman			1
it has previously been attacked for its handling of the @entity30 child abuse scandal , the pay offs by the @entity5 to its senior managers and the £ 100million of the corporation ’s digital archive project			2
in 2009 , former @entity5 director - general @entity31 called for it to be scrapped			1
he branded it : ‘ unduly slow and bureaucratic , expensive to run and created inbuilt conflict			0
’ the move towards a board of directors , which was the system prior to the @entity7 , has also been previously floated			0
former @entity5 governor for @entity39 sir @entity38 , said in 2012 that the @entity7 ’s existence was ‘ crazy ’ , and added : ‘ the @entity7 should be scrapped as soon as possible and replaced by the former governance arrangements , in other words , go back to having governors			1
’ ahead of publishing its investigation , the committee spent months last year hearing evidence on all aspects of the @entity5 and its governance , including from its director - general @entity49 and representatives of the @entity7 itself			1
this delegation included @entity54 , who took over as chair in october last year after lord @entity56 resigned following a heart attack			0

the @entity7 was set up in 2007 as a replacement for the previous board of governors , which was accused of not being tough enough in its approach to @entity5 regulation the @entity7 has also had the same claim levelled against it and has faced harsh criticism from some of those giving evidence to the committee			2
speaking in october , culture secretary @entity84 said the organisation had questions to answer over its governance and raised concerns over its effectiveness			2
a @entity7 spokeswoman said : ‘ we are n’t going to speculate about the contents of a future committee report			2
governance will be debated at the time of charter review , along with a whole range of other issues and we will want to participate in that discussion			0
‘ we have been clear both that the @entity5 ’s independence needs to be protected and that there must be strong oversight and regulation of the corporation in the interests of licence fee payers			0
’ @entity1 declined to comment about the report and what its conclusions will be .			0

@entity111 will publish report on future of @entity5 in the next few weeks
