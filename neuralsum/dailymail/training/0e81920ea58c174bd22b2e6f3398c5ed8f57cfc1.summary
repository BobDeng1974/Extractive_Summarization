@entity1 's co-founder @entity0 has said the world must use the lessons from battling @entity4 to prepare for a future ' war ' against a global killer disease			1
at a recent conference in @entity8 , mr @entity0 said the risk of a worldwide pandemic is so high it is reckless not to act now - and added technology will be a crucial asset in the fight against disease			1
he explained : ' we do n't know it will happen but it 's a high enough chance that one of the lessons of @entity4 should be to ask ourselves : are we as ready for that as we should be ? ' a good comparison is that we prepare ourselves for war - we have planes and training and we practise			1
he explained : ' are we as ready for that as we should be ? a good comparison is that we prepare ourselves for war - we have planes and training and we practise ' he said this included building teams of volunteers who are ready to mobilise quickly in a public health emergency , similar to schemes developed in the countries hit hardest by @entity4 such as @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , which registered almost 9,000 deaths in the last year			1
' look at the death chart of the 20th century , ' he told @entity46 this week			0
' i think everybody would say there must be a spike for @entity51 enough , there it is , like 25 million			2
and there must be a big spike for @entity56 , and there it is , it 's like 65 million			2
' but then you 'll see this other spike that is as large as @entity56 right after @entity62 , and most people , would say , ' what was that ? ' well , that was the @entity65 flu			1
' the deadly flu virus attacked more than one - third of the world 's population , and within months killed more than 65 million people - three times as many as the @entity62 - and did it quicker than any other illness in recorded history			1
he said this included building teams of volunteers who are ready to mobilise quickly in a public health emergency , similar to schemes developed in the countries hit hardest by @entity4 such as @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 ( pictured ) , which registered almost 9,000 deaths in the last year in particular , mr @entity0 fears a @entity65 flu - like epidemic similar to the one that killed more than 65 million people in 1918 could decimate populations in a matter of months			1
in this image , patients of the @entity65 flu lie in @entity92 no. 1 in a @entity94 hospital as doctors battled the virus and the effects of the @entity56 researchers recently discovered the pandemic virus arose shortly before 1918 , when a human @entity101 virus , which they believe had already been circulating in the human population since about 1900 , picked up genetic material from a bird flu virus			1
most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile , elderly , or already weakened patients ; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults			2

lacking a reliable cure , public health groups concentrated on prevention the deadly flu virus attacked more than one - third of the world 's population , and within months had killed more than 65 million people - three times as many as the @entity62 - and did it more quickly than any other illness in recorded history			1
most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile , elderly , or already weakened patients ; in contrast the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults			2
to maintain morale , wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity94 , and the @entity134			0
however , newspapers were free to report the epidemic 's effects in @entity65 , creating a false impression of @entity65 as being especially hard hit - and leading to the pandemic 's nickname @entity65 flu			1
the close quarters and massive troop movements of @entity62 hastened the pandemic and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation , researchers believe			2
the global mortality rate from the 1918/1919 pandemic is not known , but an estimated 10 % to 20 % of those who were infected died , with estimates of the total number of deaths ranging from 50 to 100 million people			1
calling vaccines the ' biggest saver of lives ' worldwide , the 59 - year - old praised @entity132 chancellor @entity160 for hosting the conference and making vaccinations a priority of her @entity165 presidency this year			1
however , he said he was ' concerned ' about an anti-vaccination trend in the @entity168 , due to exaggerated fears of risks associated with the jabs , that was leading to dangerous outbreaks			2
' our focus is on the poor children where you have millions that die of vaccine - preventable disease			2
it 's unfortunate that you 're not getting 100 - per cent coverage in the rich countries , ' he said			0
' they 're choosing to potentially infect somebody who ca n't protect themselves , ' he said , noting the renewed spread of illnesses such as measles and pertussis ( whooping cough )			0

calling vaccines the ' biggest saver of lives ' worldwide , the 59 - year - old praised @entity132 chancellor @entity160 ( right ) for making vaccinations a priority of her @entity165 presidency ' i 'm glad there are people who are championing reducing these misunderstandings in rich countries because of the risk that creates			1
' mr @entity0 - ranked by @entity211 as the world 's richest man with a net worth of some $ 80 billion ( Â£ 52 billion ) - said the @entity215 already distributes about $ 4 billion each year to help the world 's neediest			1
@entity4 's ' achilles heel ' has been identified by a team of scientists , prompting hopes of new treatments to stop the virus spreading			0
researchers in @entity224 believe they have located the vital protein , which affects whether or not the virus can spread to infect its victim			0
their study found the virus can only invade host cells by attaching to the protein - called @entity229 ( @entity231 )			0
if it is unable to access that protein , it loses the ability to infect and kill its victim			0
the vicious disease has infected almost 27,000 people , killing 11,135 , in the last 18 months			2
it is also a major contributor to the @entity113 , which tuesday drew pledges of $ 7.5 billion to help immunise 300 million more children in developing countries over the next five years			0
and he continued technology is a crucial asset in his foundation 's field work , seen most recently in a drive against polio			1
' we use satellite photos to find out where people are living , we use a gps tracker with a cell phone so that we can see if the vaccine team is going to every place they 're supposed to go , we do statistical analysis within a few days to see if there 's any kids that we missed , ' he said			0
' measurement is a pretty natural private sector thing ... innovative new technologies are going to make it possible to see what 's going on with far less cost			0
' mr @entity0 said moving from the world of big business to working in villages in the developing world where people ' have no idea who i am ' had been satisfying			1
' i was super proud of the work i did at @entity1			0
. it let me carry the message of software out into the world in a very enthused way , ' he said			0
' now i have a different message , my wife and i , that we should be generous to the poor			0
to the degree i have visibility hopefully i 'm using that in a positive way			0

@entity0 said the risk of a pandemic meant it was reckless not to act now
he added technology will be a crucial asset in the fight against disease
the 59 - year - old *philanthropist* compared it to preparing for war
and fears a pandemic - like @entity65 flu which wiped out 50 million people in 1918 - could decimate populations in less than a year
