@entity0 lamented @entity2 's early exit from their first ever @entity4 campaign after being ousted by @entity5 on away goals at the @entity8 play - off stage			1
for a club who had so relished the chance to taste continental competition and all it had to offer there is something oddly fitting in their departure on a technicality that has defined @entity4 football for so long			0
the seeds of the @entity21 ' disappointment were sowed in @entity22 last week , when @entity24 's error handed the hosts a 1 - 0 win			1
' that 's @entity4 football ... we 've experienced it and what it 's all about , the frustrations , the disappointments , the away goal rule ... , ' said a rueful @entity0			1
' to go out the way we did is the worst , away goals , but that 's the competition			1
that 's what playing in @entity49 is like			1
' it 's a totally different ball game and we did n't get to grips with it			2
' to have had a big couple of @entity4 nights would have been terrific so it 's a shame			2
' it would have been a great adventure for everyone concerned			0
goal : @entity33 scored twice for the @entity21 but could n't stop them going out of the @entity8 ' we 've won the match and gone out on the rule but if we 're being honest we did n't play to the levels i expect			1
' we made far too many mistakes , we gave the ball away far too cheaply in really good areas and four or five did n't get to the level you would expect			0
that 's the disappointing thing for me , even though we won the game			0
' it 's gone too quick for everyone but it 's not to be so we move on			0
' part of the moving on phase involves completing the transfer business @entity0 had set in motion with half an eye on a gruelling group campaign			2
captain : @entity84 reacts to @entity2 's exit from the @entity8 - their first ever continental competition @entity88 striker @entity87 is close to coming in on a club record deal from @entity90			1
the player has passed a medical and agreed terms and a work permit hearing on friday should determine if the deal can go ahead			0
' things are advancing quickly , we have to get work permits and bits and pieces done but we 're trying hard , ' said @entity0			2
' the medical is okay , and personal terms , we just have to get through the red tape			0
' there 's still one or two issues to be ironed out			0
we 'll see how we get on			0
' transfer : new signing @entity106 was at the game watching his new side go out of the @entity8			1

@entity2 are out of the @entity8 despite beating @entity111 2 - 1
@entity0 's side lost 1 - 0 away so go out on away goals
this was the @entity21 ' first ever *season* in @entity49
@entity87 is close to signing from @entity90
