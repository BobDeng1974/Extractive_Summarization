by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor @entity3 suggested sales of junk food would be higher in areas where food banks are most popular people use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food , @entity3 claimed yesterday			1
the former cabinet minister said there was a ‘ near infinite demand ’ for anything free			1
the @entity17 peer was speaking in a @entity18 debate about food banks – which @entity21 claim are booming because @entity23 austerity policies leave many people unable to make ends meet			1
but @entity3 suggested more people were using them because the number of banks has increased and they would prefer not to pay for food			2
it follows research showing the number of families claiming they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years – as the number of food banks has risen			1
the peer said : ‘ there is always a near infinite demand for valuable goods that are given away free			1
‘ one can even notice it in the catering departments of this building			0
if food is given away at prices grossly below the markets more is used			0
’ he invited environment minister @entity47 to ‘ initiate some research into the sales of junk food in areas where people are living for their basic food on the food banks ’			1
earlier this month @entity17 welfare minister @entity56 said the demand for food banks was difficult to understand			1
‘ clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly , ’ he added			0
‘ however , it is very hard to know why people go to them			0
’ the intervention came after a series of peers in the @entity18 had called on the government to tackle the scale of food bank usage in the @entity70			2
lord @entity71 , an independent crossbench peer , said it was a ‘ scandal in today ’s society that food banks have to exist at all ’			2
labour peers ’ leader @entity76 said food banks in the @entity79 gave aid to more than 40,000 adults and 20,000 children last year			2
she described it as down to ‘ desperate pressing demand due to a cost of living crisis ’ and called for @entity47 to visit one			0
lord @entity47 said he had visited a food bank and they were run by ‘ wonderful people and donated to by hugely generous folk ’			0
the government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need ‘ they perform a very valuable service distributing food to people who really need it and they tend to operate at a local level , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity70 has a great tradition of charitable giving and i think it would be a bad day when we started to interfere with that			0
’ only 8.1 per cent of @entity70 admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012 , down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 last year @entity17 education secretary @entity105 sparked outrage when he claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks because of their own ‘ decisions ’			1
he suggested that many cash - strapped families have brought their problems on @entity113 added : ‘ i appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures			0
‘ those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances			0
‘ we need to ensure that support is not just financial , and that the right decisions are made			0
’ a study by the @entity125 found @entity70 were among the least likely in the developed world to say there were times when they could not afford food , an international report found			1
only 8.1 per cent reported this in 2012 , down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 – before the economic crisis and when @entity21 was in power			1
the study , which represents industrialised nations , flies in the face of left - wing claims that cuts in public spending are leaving thousands of families going hungry			0
the number of food banks has increased over the past few years , with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them			2
it emerged this month that more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £ 3million to the taxpayer			1
while most town halls paid for support such as management and administration , some were even paying for the food .			0
