revolution : gene therapies can change a person 's dna regulators yesterday approved the first therapy in the western world that can correct errors in a person ’s genetic code			1
@entity10 has approved @entity11 to be used against a rare inherited disorder which disrupts fat production in the body			1
the treatment uses a virus to counteract @entity17 , lipoprotein lipase deficiency , which can led to acute inflammation of the pancreas			0
the illness affects around one or two people per million and sufferers have damaged copies of a gene which is essential for breaking down fats			0
the virus infects muscle cells with a copy of a healthy gene and a one - off treatment is effective			2
the treatment was backed by an advisory panel to the @entity34 in july and full approval was granted yesterday			2
the medicine should be available next year			0
professor @entity37 , of the @entity38 , said the therapy would have a ‘ dramatic impact ’ on patients			0
only two other gene therapies have previously been approved for sale , both in @entity44			0
it will cost around £ 1 million ( $ 1.6 million ) per patient , a new record for pricey modern medicines			1
@entity48 , chief executive of @entity50 - based @entity49 , said more such treatments would follow and argued a high price was justified because gene therapy restored natural body function and was not just a short - term fix			1
' this provides higher benefit to patients than the classical protein replacement strategy and this is why we think we should be fairly and adequately compensated , ' he said in a telephone interview on friday patients with @entity17 , which affects no more than one or two people per million , are unable to handle fat particles in their blood and are at risk of acute and potentially fatal inflammation of the pancreas			0
the approval follows a positive recommendation from the @entity71 in july			2
@entity11 treats the genetic disorder lipoprotein lipase deficiency ( @entity17 ) by altering sufferers ' dna			1
@entity17 affects about one in a million people , leaving them without a vital gene that breaks down fat particles in their blood			0
it means fat builds up in the blood leading to abdominal pain and life - threatening inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis )			0
the only other way to manage the disease is by having a very low - fat diet			1
the therapy uses a virus ( pictured ) to infect muscle cells with a working copy of the gene			0
the privately owned firm is now working with governments on potential pricing strategies , which are likely to vary from country to country , ahead of the commercial roll - out from the second half of 2013			1
@entity48 said some countries preferred the idea of a one - off payment at the time of treatment but others were interested in an annuity system , which would probably involve charging around £ 200,000 a year for five years			1
that kind of annual charge would put @entity11 in a similar price range to expensive enzyme replacement therapies for other rare diseases , such as @entity113 for @entity115 disease from @entity118 's @entity117 unit			1
@entity119 is also preparing to apply for regulatory approval for @entity11 in the @entity121 , @entity122 and other markets			1
the idea of treating disease by replacing a defective gene with a working copy gained credence in 1990 with the success of the world 's first gene therapy clinical tests against a rare condition called severe combined immunodeficiency ( @entity134 )			1
people with @entity134 - also known as ' bubble boy disease ' - can not cope with infections and usually die in childhood			2
the field then suffered a major setback when an @entity142 teenager died in a gene therapy experiment in 1999 and two @entity145 boys with @entity134 developed leukaemia in 2002			0
in @entity44 , @entity147 won approval for a gene therapy drug for head and neck cancer in 2003 but no products have been approved until now in @entity10 or the @entity121			2
more recently , some large pharmaceutical companies have also been exploring gene therapy			0
@entity154 , for example , signed a deal in 2010 with @entity157 researchers to develop a @entity134 therapy .			0

@entity161 drug given green light for rare disease
@entity11 to cost £ *1m* ( $ 1.6m ) for each patient
drug is first to get approval in western world
@entity172 go - ahead paves way for many more treatments
