the parents of a young man with severe autism who has been chained to a hospital bed for 14 days claim that healthcare authorities have ignored their pleas for support			1
@entity9 's son @entity8 was diagnosed with autism at the age of two , and suffers from high levels of anxiety and trauma , which she said was caused by years of care givers repeatedly ignoring his needs			1
despite persistent calls by @entity19 and her husband @entity20 to the @entity21 about the lack of support and appropriate care options , @entity8 was apprehended by police at his accommodation centre and taken to the @entity27 in @entity28 , where he has been restrained for 14 days			2
' when my mum passed away in 2012 @entity8 started showing outbursts of behaviour , and was n't coping			0
he withdrew and became depressed and became obsessed with the fact that people died , ' mrs @entity9 told @entity42			1
' he kept reliving losing her and was haunted by the fact that his baby sister had died at only a few weeks old , and this developed into real trauma , ' she said			2
@entity8 's sister @entity47 died at only four and half weeks old , an event which still distresses him , and made the deaths of his grandparents more acute and created a fear of hospitals and death			1
after a long battle to develop in - home care that would meet @entity8 's growing needs , the @entity9 's were finally told that if he became aggressive that they would have to resort to calling the police			1
' we did n't want to do that , we wanted to have help in our home that would mean we could work with him and provide therapy so he learnt how to deal with his anxiety and anger , ' mrs @entity9 said			1
after struggling to control @entity8 's outbursts and teach him how to deal with his emotions , @entity8 's behaviour continued to escalate and his parents made the heartbreaking decision to phone the police			1
@entity8 has severe autism and spent his 21st birthday shackled to a hospital bed despite his parent 's desperate pleas to healthcare authorities who they say have failed him @entity8 ( centre ) with his mother @entity84 ( left ) and father @entity20 ( right ) say their son has deteriorated as a result of ignorance about his condition and a lack of support from the @entity21 ' he could n't even go in the ambulance to hospital because he was scared that he would die , everyone who had been taken away in an ambulance died , ' mrs @entity9 said			1
since then , mrs @entity9 said her son has been through a cycle of being shackled and sedated over the past two years , in and out of respite houses , care facilities , and the hospital , with no treatment plans for the grief and trauma he was experiencing from the bewildering experiences			1
mrs @entity9 said that there was an incident where the family received a letter informing them they were removing him to a facility without consent , despite weeks of negotiations			2
' when i went to visit him in the respite home he was all over me , really touchy - feely because he was alone there , all by himself , with no physical contact			0
the carers would n't talk to him or interact with him and he was deprived of sensory experiences , ' she said			0
a spokesperson from the @entity21 said that it was not policy to leave a client in isolation , and that the @entity21 had been working consistently towards finding a solution that was appropriate and were seeking to address @entity8 's needs			2
@entity8 's parents said they have exhausted themselves begging for funding to keep him at home to give him the support and therapy he needs with healthcare professionals who know his case and are familiar with him			1
' the problem is the system has put him into a cycle of trauma - he 'll feel safe and secure and then be sent back to square one , ' mrs @entity9 said			2
' i 'm sure if he had normal abilities they would n’t be able to treat him like that , ' she said			0
' had someone worked with us we would never have gotten into cycle			0
this is bureaucracy gone mad , getting police to deal with our children instead of helping them through grief and loss , ' said mrs @entity9 @entity8 's parents said they have exhausted themselves begging for funding to keep him at home to give him the support and therapy he needs mrs @entity9 said her son has been through a cycle of being shackled and sedated over the past two years , in and out of respite houses , care facilities , and the hospital with no treatment plans for the grief and trauma he was experiencing from the bewildering experiences the @entity9 's believe that the lack of understanding about autism and the level of ignorance even within the @entity21 has resulted in her son living in a constant state of fear and anxiety			1
the depression and anger he exhibited only continued , exacerbated by a system which @entity8 's family claims refuses to act until their situation reaches a crisis point , and he is shackled and heavily sedated to the point of terror			2
' i feel so powerless because we ca n't do anything , and it 's heartbreaking that we cant have him home because we have n’t got the funding , ' mrs @entity9 said			1
' had someone worked with us we would never have gotten into cycle			0
this is bureaucracy gone mad , getting police to deal with our children instead of helping them through grief and loss is not the way to go , ' she said			0
on november 21 , @entity8 was taken to hospital after acting out at a centre in the city of @entity195			2
the @entity21 reportedly has other policies for dealing with such situations , and while calling the police was one option which might be used if needed , it was not the only one available			0
other approaches which could be used such as dimming lights , talking in soft voices , and withdrawing from the room			0
@entity8 has spent the past fortnight strapped down in @entity27 , and his mother said he has been given heavy doses of drugs to prevent him from escaping			1
a spokesperson from the @entity21 said ' @entity8 was admitted to the @entity209 by his family			0
his family and a consulting physician are making decisions about his care while in hospital , ' ' while several options for support have been offered for @entity8 ’ long term care , these options have not so far been accepted by his family			2

' @entity8 's baby sister died at only four and a half weeks old , an event which distresses him still @entity8 's parents @entity84 and @entity20 say that their son has high levels of anxiety and that hospitals scare him ' he is a prisoner in that room , he is n't allowed cant go out because they ca n't risk it , and he does n’t get to see daylight , he 's maintained in one room , ' mrs @entity9 said			1
' prisoners actually get treated better , and why should he have less because he 's an autistic child ? he had no choice in the matter , ' she said			0
' he has a right to be safe and secure and not be labelled as a problem to society , ' she said			0

the petition has been signed by more than 17,000 people who support the call for greater funding and for @entity8 's needs to be addressed			1
' i did n't want to use @entity8 , but i had to tell his story and put it out there because it was the only way to reach to the community , so people know what has happened to people with autism , ' she said			0
' @entity8 needs a voice to show whats happened to him			0
if we do n’t start getting it right we ’ll have an epidemic , ' ' people relinquish their kids because they get exhausted with the system crying for help			0
it 's meant to protect the vulnerable instead of treating them like non-humans			0
