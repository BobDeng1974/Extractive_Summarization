by @entity0 @entity1 , 56 , admitted his role in the drug offending and was sentenced to seven years in jail a gang of drug smugglers has been jailed for a total of 44 years after trying to import more than £ 1million worth of cocaine into the @entity9 hidden in tins of a popular @entity12 vegetable dish			1
one of the men , @entity1 , 56 , was a baggage handler at @entity15 and was vital in helping slip the cocaine , which was secured in the tins of @entity18 , through security checks			1
the five men and two women were sentenced after either admitting their role or being found guilty in the sophisticated drug smuggling operation at @entity24 in @entity25 on friday			1
it began in april last year when @entity27 , 33 , from @entity28 , travelled to @entity29 , @entity12 with his partner			0
a month later , he met @entity31 , 51 , and @entity32 , 54 , in @entity33 before later meeting an unnamed associate to discuss taking up to 12 kilograms of cocaine from @entity12 to @entity9 for a fee of £ 100,000			1
the plan was for the drugs to travel from @entity39 to @entity40 , then from @entity40 to @entity41 , in an attempt to attract less attention than a direct flight from the @entity45			0
on june 12 @entity46 , 36 , from @entity28 , and another person arranged to meet others in the gang in @entity50			0
however , their attempt failed when @entity53 , 55 , also of @entity28 , panicked when she could n't see the bag the airport luggage carousel			2
instead , she grabbed another bag from the carousel and was arrested for theft			0
unaware his operation was being watched by police and the @entity61 , @entity31 attempted to smuggle again			2
this time @entity62 , 51 , @entity40 , travelled from @entity15 to @entity12 in september			2
on her september 19 return to @entity15 , she did not leave the airport as she was booked onto a transfer flight to @entity66 in @entity67			1
as a result her baggage was ' in transfer ' and therefore collected by the transfer baggage handlers			2
later that day , police raided @entity15 baggage handler @entity1 ’ home and found a small rucksack with four sealed tins of the popular @entity12 chopped leaf vegetable labelled @entity77 in the kitchen			1
the tins contained cocaine with a street value of £ 400,000			1
callaloo is a spinach - like vegetable dish seasoned and steamed in @entity12 , often eaten for breakfast			0
these are the tins in which the cocaine was found after @entity62 returned to @entity9 from @entity12 inside the sealed tins of @entity18 was cocaine worth about £ 400,000 @entity1 , who was sentenced to seven years jail , was a baggage handler at @entity15 ( pictured )			1
a succession of arrests followed which included the wider members of the group			2
all the defendants pleaded guilty apart from @entity62 , who denied the offence throughout but was found guilty at trial at @entity24 on march 26			1
@entity62 had previously been sentenced to a 10 year prison sentence in 1996 for the importation of 3kgs of cocaine in her luggage via @entity102			2
detective inspector @entity103 from the @entity105 ’s @entity104 and @entity106 said : ' these sentences are a satisfying culmination of months of painstaking police work by officers from the @entity105 and @entity111			0
those involved have had a direct link with the supply to mid-level dealers within @entity40 and @entity116 and i would like to pay tribute to my colleagues whose fine work led to their incarceration			0
' this investigation shows that we will seek anyone actively involved in the drugs trade and use all the powers available to us to combat it			0
' the message is clear - if you deal in drugs we will find you , we will arrest you and you will be put in front of the courts to face the consequences of your actions			0

the group first failed in their attempts to smuggle cocaine into @entity9 and were caught by police the second time @entity142 ( left ) received a sentence of five years and eight months jail for his role in planning the failed caper , while @entity31 ( right ) was sentenced to 11 years in jail @entity53 ( left ) and @entity62 ( right )			1
@entity148 panicked when she could not see her bag at the airport luggage carousel during the group 's first attempt at smuggling cocaine from @entity12 to @entity9 detective superintendent @entity155 , head of operations at @entity159 - the @entity154 organised crime unit , said : “ this was a sophisticated gang with influences in several major @entity9 cities as well as criminal contacts abroad			1
' the ringleaders devised a ploy whereby they used couriers to make several flights during the importing of the drugs to ensure their bags remained ‘ in transfer ’			0
' they thought this would avoid detection but clearly they were wrong and law enforcement agencies became wise to their intentions at an early stage			0
' once we knew about all the people involved they were systematically arrested and incriminating evidence was found			0
the fact that all but one pleaded guilty showed the overwhelming evidence against them			1
' @entity159 and the @entity105 worked extremely closely to dismantle this conspiracy and seize more than a million pounds of drugs destined for the streets of cities across the @entity9			1
' the jailing of this gang shows that there is no criminal out there that is beyond @entity159 ’s reach			0
