@entity1 @entity0 governor @entity0 sent a letter to a prominent @entity4 attorney that was signed : ' thank you and @entity7			1
' ' my guess is it was a typo , ' @entity0 , who is considering running for president in 2016 , said when asked about the slip - up at the governor 's mansion on wednesday			1
@entity0 presumably meant to write ' mazel tov ' - a @entity4 phrase to express congratulations and best wishes - when he sent the undated letter to prominent @entity20 attorney @entity19			1
the letter , sent when @entity0 was @entity23 executive , had long been forgotten but surfaced again when documents for @entity26 investigations were released in august , the @entity21 reported			1
he said he suspects it was written around 2003			0
oops : @entity30 governor @entity0 , pictured speaking at the @entity29 in march , sent a letter to a @entity4 attorney that was signed off : ' thank you and @entity7 ' - instead of ' mazel tov ' gaffe : @entity0 has since claimed that the slip up - which was at the end of a letter about placing a menorah at the @entity40 - was probably just a typo			1
he thinks the letter is from around 2003 he was writing to @entity43 to say he would be happy to display a menorah celebrating ' @entity45 of @entity46 ' at the @entity40			0
' he kinda missed the boat there , ' @entity19 told the @entity49			0
' " @entity7 " is a far cry from " mazel tov "			2
' recipient : he sent the letter to attorney @entity19 , who called the error ' pretty basic ' @entity19 added that he ca n't recall the letter and likely stopped reading after seeing @entity0 had accepted the menorah proposal			2
if he had seen the mistake , he would have called him to point it out , he said			0
' that 's pretty basic , ' @entity19 said			0
@entity0 , the son of a @entity63 preacher and a practicing @entity64 , has been courting @entity4 voters ahead of his potential bid for the presidency			1
@entity0 spoke at the @entity29 spring meeting this year and , in an attempt to woo the audience , mentioned that the governor 's mansion has a ' menorah candle '			1
he said on wednesday that menorah is the same one that he displayed at the @entity40 following the request from @entity43			0
in the speech , he also vaguely signaled his support for @entity78 and said that the name of his oldest son , @entity80 , comes from the @entity82 word for ' gift from god '			0
on wednesday , @entity0 likened discussion of the ' @entity7 ' typo to discussion during his re-election campaign about why his thumb had a bandage on it and comments he made about his bald spot being caused by hitting his head on a cabinet			2
' my thumb has healed up and my bald spot is boring now , and they have to talk about things like that , ' he said .			0
