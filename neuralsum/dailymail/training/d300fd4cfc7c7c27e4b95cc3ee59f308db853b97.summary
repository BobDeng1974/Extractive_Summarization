@entity0 , 20 , worked at three separate chains of the @entity4 takeaway @entity2 , in @entity5 , before being dismissed via @entity7 messenger a takeaway deliver driver has been left jobless after his bosses allegedly sacked him out of the blue via @entity7			1
@entity0 , 20 , worked at three separate chains of the @entity4 takeaway @entity2 , in @entity5 , often notching up 60 hours a week			1
however , the driver was dismissed from the firm this week with no warning after bosses claimed he failed to turn up for work and had ' attitude '			1
mr @entity0 , who was on a zero hours contract which stated that both parties had to give a week 's notice of dismissal , has now been left furious over the way the incident was handled			1
the only exceptions for him to be given instant dismissal , as stated in his contract , are that of employee misconduct , incompetence or negligence â€“ but he claims he did nothing wrong			1
he was told that he was being sacked on @entity7 messenger , despite never having had a written warning or a complaint against him			1
now unemployed , mr @entity0 said : ' firing someone over social media is completely unacceptable to me			1
it came completely out of the blue , when i was not expecting it , and it is so impersonal			2
' i had a good experience of working there and got on with the regional manager			2
' i had only been working on @entity44 for a week when the manager of that shop told me i was fired			0
' i think it was wrong of him - doing it over social media was unprofessional and the least i would have expected is a phone call , or a quick face - to - face chat			1
' i do n't want anyone else to have this happen to them			0
it is a horrible thing to pop up when you are just browsing the internet			0
' when i first saw the message come through i was in total shock , i almost fell over			0
i had just been talking to a friend and then this came through			0
' the manager did n't even tell me himself , he got someone else to do it			0
i just ca n't believe it			0
' mr @entity0 began working at the city 's @entity68 branch of the takeaway earlier this year before moving to the @entity72 outlet four months later in the hope of receiving more hours			1
however , after realising he was not getting enough work to cover his petrol , he moved to a third outlet in @entity78 where he was promised permanent work			2
but just four days into the role , @entity0 received a private message on @entity7 from the trainee manager , telling him the district manager had decided to sack him			1
the message read : ' i do n't no ( sic ) what has gone on in the other shops but unfortunately you have now been fired from @entity2			0
' thanks for working for me but there is nothing i can do ... you have been fired due to not turning up and your attitude			0
' mr @entity0 worked at three different branches of @entity4 takeaway @entity2 in @entity5 ( one of which is pictured above ) before he was dismissed over @entity7 messenger for ' failing to turn up to work ' and for his ' attitude ' he was told that he was no longer entitled to work at the branch as he had been dismissed from earlier jobs with the company for failing to turn up to work			1
but mr @entity0 claims this was not the case and that he had been unfairly dismissed by @entity2			1
he said : ' they said that it was because i had n't turned up to work , but that just is n't true			2
' i had a couple of days off for personal grievances and there was another occasion when i had a flat tyre			0
' i gave them plenty of notices on both occasions and they were fine with it , they were very supportive			0
' i really do n't think this is fair and i will battle to make sure this happens to no one else			0
' his mother , @entity124 , added : ' i think it is a disgusting , rude way to treat an employee			0
' @entity0 has always let the company know when he ca n't work , and them sacking him like this violates his contract			1
' a spokesman from @entity2 said : ' we are sorry that mr @entity0 feels that he has been treated unfairly			1
' he did make contact with our head office last thursday about his grievance and since then we have been attempting to resolve his complaint			0
' @entity2 takes any complaint from its employees extremely seriously and would never use @entity7 as an appropriate medium to inform a member of staff that they are no longer required			2
' we have been trying to contact mr @entity0 to clarify who sent the message informing him of his employment status			2
' if the message was sent on behalf of @entity2 , this matter will be treated very seriously and thoroughly investigated			2
