@entity0 is suing the @entity1 after the religious organisation left a 15 - storey construction in the city empty for six years			1
the church bought the @entity6 in 2007 using millions in donations from its members under the premise of building a cathedral			1
however , despite high - flying plans of building a chapel , a bookstore and even an office for its deceased leader , @entity15 , the windows of the @entity1 building remain boarded up			1
dead project : the @entity1 bought the 15 - story @entity20 building in downtown @entity0 for $ 7.85million in 2007 , but nothing has been done since the @entity20 building was purchased by the church for $ 7.85million , all of which had been donated by @entity26			1
now , after six years of little to no progress apart from the plywood covering doors and windows , the city has had enough			0
@entity0 's @entity32 is taking the church to court , which could result in daily fines of several hundred dollars			1
a spokesperson for the department told @entity37 the @entity1 lack construction permits , and have been violating the city ’s ‘ doors - and - windows ’ ordinance for nearly a year			2
forcing progress : the building , seen at the centre of the image , has remained boarded up for six years and the city of @entity0 is now taking the church to court should the @entity32 be successful in their court order , the @entity1 could be liable for $ 300 - per - day fines for each boarded up window and door			1
on its website the religious organisation describes the building which they renamed ‘ the @entity59 ’ as ‘ a shining example of the religion that can and does secure total freedom for all ’			0
the latest update on the project came two years ago when the @entity1 told local papers they were planning on starting renovations in 2012 , to open in spring 2013			2
‘ i do n't understand what 's going on there , ’ president of the @entity67 @entity66 told the @entity37 this week			0
‘ it 's obviously a free country , and they bought the building , but here we are six years later , and they 've done nothing			2
it 's not only not contributing to the street and acting to the detriment to the city , it 's also not a tax revenue			0
’ slow process : the @entity1 recently opened the impressive @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 after 15 years of construction work costing $ 145million this is not the first time the controversial church , whose members include @entity93 and @entity94 , have purchased land and property and struggled to finish their project			1
in 2006 , @entity1 bought a 50,800 sq. ft. building in @entity99 which sat empty until renovations began in 2010			1
only last month , thousands of @entity26 gathered in @entity85 , @entity86 for the opening of the $ 145million ' cathedral ' which had been in construction for nearly 15 years			0
the group broke ground on the @entity106 - style @entity84 in 1998 , but stopped work after finishing the shell			0
for three years , the group ceased construction on the project until the city started imposing $ 250 - a - day fines for code violations			2
scientology defectors have explained that the building 's slow construction is due to church leaders , who have allegedly used the project as a fundraising cash cow			0
an analysis by the @entity122 discovered that the church had raised $ 145million for the building , much higher than the $ 100million it was estimated to cost .			0

the 15 - storey @entity20 building has been empty for six years
the building was bought using $ 7.85million donated by church members
city of @entity0 is now taking @entity1 to court
