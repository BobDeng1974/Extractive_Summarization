this is the hope of researchers at the @entity10 who have developed technology that will allow people to control household devices with simple gestures			1
the technology , named ‘ @entity16 ’ , is similar in concept to how @entity20 's @entity19 sensor works by using cameras to recognise gestures			1
the system detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of @entity31 signals as they reflect off a moving human body by adapting a @entity31 router and wireless household devices , the researchers developed a system that can detect specific movements without the need for sensors or cameras			1
they claim it is simpler and cheaper than similar gesture - recognition technologies			0
@entity16 works using the doppler effect - the way a wave of sound or light changes frequency at the point it is observed depending on the source of the wave ’s movements			1
a common example of the doppler effect is the change in pitch of an ambulance siren as it passes			0
a standard @entity31 router can be adapted to function as a receiver			0
this receiver then listens to all of the wireless transmissions coming from devices throughout a home , including smartphones , laptops and tablets			0
when a person moves , there is a slight change in the frequency of the wireless signal			0
moving a hand or foot causes the receiver to detect a pattern of changes known as the @entity77 frequency shift			0
these frequency changes are very small – only several hertz – when compared with @entity31 signals that have a 20 megahertz bandwidth and operate at 5 gigahertz			1
an algorithm to detect these slight shifts and the system also accounts for gaps in wireless signals when devices are n’t transmitting			0
if a person wants to use the @entity16 , they would perform a specific repetition gesture sequence to get access to the receiver			0
once the wireless receiver locks onto the user , they can perform normal gestures to interact with the devices and appliances in her home			1
the researchers tested these gestures with five users in a two - bedroom apartment and an office environment			2
out of the 900 gestures performed , @entity16 accurately recognised 94 per cent of them			2
it was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver			1
the @entity31 receiver listens to all of the wireless transmissions coming from devices throughout a home , including smartphones , laptops and tablets			2
when a person moves there is a slight change in the frequency of the wireless signal @entity122 , a doctoral student in computer science and engineering at the university , who has worked with @entity126 on two other similar technologies			0
@entity128 , which , as its name suggests , uses sound waves to monitor whole - body gestures and @entity132 , which uses radiation from electrical wires			2
but @entity16 stands apart because it does n’t require the user to be in the same room as the receiver or the device			2
@entity16 detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of @entity31 signals as they reflect off a moving human body			1
when specific gestures are used , it was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver			1
‘ this is the first whole - home gesture recognition system that works without either requiring instrumentation of the user with sensors or deploying cameras in every room , ’ said @entity146 , who worked on the research project			1
the researchers now plan to look at the ability to control multiple devices at once			0
@entity16 detects the changes in the electromagnetic waves of @entity31 signals as they reflect off a moving human body			1
using a software algorithm , the technology can identify nine different whole - body gestures , ranging from pushing , pulling and punching to full - body bowling			2
video : @entity165 signals enable gesture recognition in the home			0

system allows users to control home appliances using body movements
detects tiny changes in @entity31 signals as they reflect off a moving body
five people can move in the same room without confusing the system
system , called ' @entity16 ’ , is similar in concept to how the @entity19 sensor uses cameras to recognise gestures - but does *n't* need a camera or sensors
