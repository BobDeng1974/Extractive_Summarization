i do this job as i 'm proud of what we do and i love it			0
' we are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad			0
' our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors			0
' ms @entity1 said there were ' all sorts of options ' but insisted that she would never turn patients away from her 953 - bed hospital			1
the huge level of demand for care has forced the use of non-ward areas for bed space - including makeshift wards in the medical school			0

and an increasing number of nursing staff are going off sick due to stress and sheer exhaustion - making the creaking hospital 's staffing situation even worse			2
asked if they 'd reached crisis point , ms @entity1 said : ' our bread and butter is dealing with crisis , so i would never say that , as that 's what our clinicians are trained to deal with			1

' a report , which went before the @entity96 trust board yesterday , ( @entity97 ) , revealed the @entity28 four - hour target had been missed a number of times and two patients had to wait more than 12 hours in @entity28			2
ms @entity1 said those two cases involved ' patients with complex needs '			2

' sickness due to stress is high and the general level of sickness across the trust is up			0
' ms @entity1 said stress had been compounded as @entity28 admissions had climbed at the time of some ward moves - during a redecoration programme to maintain standards			1
