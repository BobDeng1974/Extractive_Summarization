@entity0 cynically tried to prevent the release of damaging files exposing the scale of the cover - up over paedophile mp @entity5			1
the @entity6 repeatedly blocked @entity8 ’s attempts to see the bombshell documents – and caved in only after being threatened with @entity11 action			1
after the shocking year - long fight , we can reveal the content of the papers , which expose just how much the @entity16 knew about the late politician ’s sexual and physical abuse of young boys			1
the secrecy row will also focus attention on cabinet secretary sir @entity35 , who has become known as ‘ sir @entity36 ’ after blocking the release of dozens of messages exchanged by @entity40 and @entity41 ahead of the @entity43 war			2
following @entity8 ’s victory , it can be revealed for the first time that : - @entity22 was personally told that police had investigated claims that @entity5 indecently assaulted teenage boys in the 1960s			1
- @entity22 was explicitly warned that awarding a knighthood to the 29 - stone @entity52 mp risked damaging the ‘ integrity of the honours system ’ , but went ahead anyway			1
- a senior @entity56 mandarin took the ‘ exceptional ’ step of contacting the country ’s top prosecutor and police to find out why @entity5 was never charged with abusing boys at a hostel he helped run			1
- civil servants feared the secret @entity5 police file might be made public in 1982 – when a burglary at the @entity67 offices of @entity69 newspaper revealed the editor was in possession of a copy			1
this revelation will lead to speculation that the break - in was linked to attempts to cover up @entity5 ’s crimes			1
one insider told @entity8 that the matter is ‘ on the deputy prime minister ’s desk ’			0
the fact that the @entity6 blocked five attempts by @entity8 to see the papers will deepen fears of a cover - up at the highest levels over the activities of vip paedophiles			1
@entity91 mp @entity90 , who exposed the scale of @entity5 ’s abuse in @entity94 , said : ‘ @entity27 and @entity28 have colluded in covering this up			1
it involves their people and we should not have to learn about this piecemeal because of journalists pestering for information			0
‘ both men need to come clean and make a personal commitment to revealing everything that is now held by @entity106 departments			0
‘ the prime minister promised there would be no stone unturned into the inquiry of historic sex abuse in @entity112			0
but the @entity6 seems to be doing the opposite			2
' @entity27 , who sits in this department , has already written to me refusing to carry out an investigation into who knew what about @entity5 in his party and it ’s disappointing to see the @entity6 continuing this unhelpful approach			1
’ @entity5 was knighted in 1988 as recognition of his service as a councillor , mayor and mp in @entity126 , @entity127			2
after his death at the age of 82 in 2010 , @entity27 said he was ‘ deeply saddened ’ by the loss and said everyone in @entity126 knew him ‘ as a friend ’			0
but two years later claims emerged that he repeatedly spanked and sexually abused boys in care homes and hostels , but the authorities saw to it that he was never brought to justice			2
@entity27 ( left ) and @entity28 ( right ) , both ministers in the @entity6 , have been accused of ‘ colluding ’ in the latest cover - up of evidence that could expose vip paedophile rings the @entity145 revealed he had been investigated in 1970 , 1988 and 1999 while @entity146 admitted there had been ‘ overwhelming evidence ’ that he abused boys both physically and sexually			1
a year ago , after a battle with campaigners , the @entity6 was forced to reveal that former @entity52 leader @entity152 had proposed @entity5 for his knighthood			1
now @entity8 has finally been given unprecedented access to the @entity0 files on the case			1
on april 28 last year , this newspaper put in a @entity159 request to the @entity6 asking for all no 10 correspondence on @entity5 ’s knighthood , which should have been answered within a month			1
but officials on four occasions put off providing a response , and then refused a request to review the case			0
in october we complained to the @entity168 , which ruled last month that the @entity6 had broken the law by failing to respond to the original request			2
the secrecy row will also focus attention on cabinet secretary sir @entity35 ( pictured ) the regulator ordered the department provide the information or risk being reported to the @entity11 where ‘ it may be dealt with as a contempt of court ’			0
a minister in the @entity6 would have been called to court to explain why the information had not been disclosed			2
on friday the department finally released a 19 - page dossier on the - secret discussions that led to @entity5 being knighted , although other pages were withheld on grounds of national security			1
the @entity6 said : ‘ we have released almost all of the information held about this matter			2
we concluded that the public interest favoured releasing this information rather than applying the usual exemptions that cover honours material			2
we are sorry that it has taken some time to consult all relevant officials			0
’ one undated letter , marked ‘ secret ’ , from a leading member of the @entity198 to @entity22 , warned of ‘ the risk that such an award could give rise to adverse criticism ’			2
lord @entity203 – son of the famous explorer – spelled out that police had investigated @entity5 in 1970 for ‘ indecent assault against teenage boys ’ between 1961 and 1966 , but that the @entity208 ( @entity208 ) had decided ‘ there was no reasonable prospect of conviction ’			2
the letter mentions the case was reported in the @entity214 and @entity215 , adding : ‘ one may regret this kind of press reporting but it could be revived if an award to mr @entity5 were made			0
’ it also describes a little - known break - in at the @entity69 newspaper in 1982 that led police to discover ‘ the editor of @entity69 had a copy of the 1970 police report ’			0
lord @entity203 said it would be ‘ slightly unfortunate ’ if this ‘ episode ’ stopped @entity5 being knighted , but added : ‘ we felt it right to warn you of our fear that the integrity of the honours system would be at some risk if the award were to be made and announced			1
’ a second note to the prime minister , dated may 1988 , admitted the committee had ‘ some hesitation ’ about the award but concluded : ‘ so far as we believe and have been able to ascertain , his past history or general character does not , in all the circumstances , render him unsuitable ’			0
a separate letter from the committee secretary says it decided to give @entity5 the ‘ benefit of the doubt ’ as he had never been prosecuted			0
the secretary had earlier warned sir @entity246 , then cabinet secretary , that ‘ the press might stir up adverse comment ’ over @entity5 ’s knighthood ‘ if there is fire under this smoke ’			1
to decide the issue they demanded to see the police evidence			0
sir @entity246 wrote to the @entity208 , saying : ‘ the case for taking the exceptional step of writing to you in this way is to protect the prime minister ( and @entity264 ) while also being fair to mr @entity5			0
’ he said the committee wanted to know ‘ whether the case against mr @entity5 was not well founded : or whether it was a sound case , but that the evidence was not likely to stand up in court ’			0
no reply from the @entity208 is recorded			0
the revelations will add to fears that the authorities knew high - profile figures were reportedly child abusers , but tried to keep the allegations secret			0
the @entity6 is still refusing to release even the titles of four recently discovered historic files on child abuse , a decision called ‘ disgusting ’ by victims ’ families			1
an wide - ranging inquiry into historic allegations of child abuse in @entity285 has yet to get under way			0
last night the @entity287 said : ‘ @entity5 ’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined			0
his actions were not known to or condoned by the @entity52 or the @entity287			0

@entity0 tried to block release of files exposing scale of cover - up
@entity6 only caved in after being threatened with @entity300
papers expose how much @entity16 knew about @entity5 *'s* abuse
@entity22 was told police had probed claims he abused teenagers
she was warned that handing him knighthood risked damaging ' integrity of the honours system ' - but went ahead anyway
