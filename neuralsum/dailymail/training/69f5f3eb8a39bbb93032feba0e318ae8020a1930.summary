an empty glass bottle bought for just $ 5 at a flea market turned out to be an incredibly rare 130 - year - old forerunner to @entity3			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , bought the @entity8 bottle after it caught his eye among a heap of bric - a - brac and took it home to put in his collection			1
it was only when he noticed the bottle was embossed with the name @entity17 , the inventor of @entity3 , that he realised what he had just bought			1
this empty glass bottle , which was bought for just $ 5 at a flea market , is in fact an incredibly rare 130 - year - old forerunner to @entity3 @entity8 was the brainchild of dr @entity17 , a pharmacist who had fought in the @entity24 , and was a blend of wine , alcohol and cocaine launched in the early 1880s			1
@entity17 marketed it as ' nerve tonic ' and extolled its astounding medical qualities , claiming it could cure morphine addiction , headaches , constipation and even impotence			1
its paper label boasted it was : ' the marvellous invigorater ! the great nerve tonic ! the queen of stimulants ! the intellectual beverage ! ' the concoction was an instant hit but with laws tightening around the use of alcohol in 1886 , dr @entity17 developed a non-alcoholic variation using the kola nut			1
he named the new elixir @entity3 after its two main elements - cocaine and kola nut			2
it was n't until 1929 that the drink became completely free of the narcotic			0
it was only when mr @entity4 noticed the bottle was embossed with the name @entity17 , the inventor of @entity3 , that he realised what he had just bought @entity3 went on to become the world 's best selling drink			1
an estimated two billion glasses of @entity3 are now drunk worldwide every day			2
after being studied by experts the bottle , now for sale for $ 5,000 , was revealed to be the best example of only three @entity8 bottles known to exist because its label is still in tact			1
it is the only one ever to come up at auction , and is now estimated to sell for 1,500 times the price mr @entity4 paid for it just six months ago			2
mr @entity4 , a casino poker dealer and amateur antiques collector , said : ' it caught my eye and i could see that it was related to the coca plant because it had a coca leaves on the label and it said " wine coca "			0
' it was embossed with the name @entity17			2
i 'm not a big @entity3 collector so it was n't until i got home that i googled and saw that it was dr. @entity17 , the creator of @entity3			1
@entity8 was the brainchild of dr @entity17 , a pharmacist who had fought in the @entity24 , and was a blend of wine , alcohol and cocaine launched in the early 1880s ' it sounds like it 's the only one like it in the world with the label in tact			2
if that 's the case then a @entity3 collector needs to own it			0
' @entity98 , director of @entity99 at @entity100 , said : ' the bottle , embossed with @entity3 creator @entity17 's name and retaining 90 per cent of the original label , has been dated to the 1880s and is believed to be one of just three such bottles known to exist			1
' this is as rare a piece of pop culture relating to the world 's most beloved beverage as you are ever likely to see			0
' the mostly intact original label establishes the example we are selling as being in the finest condition of the few specimens known to exist			0
' condition is nearly as important as rarity to serious collectors of antique advertising items			0
' when these two qualities converge in the same item , as is the case here , interest from hobbyists increases exponentially			0
' there 's really no telling what something like this is potentially worth since nothing like it has ever really been up for public auction			0
' we 're opening the bidding at what we feel is a conservative jumping off point and we 'll await the verdict of the marketplace			0
' the auction will take place in @entity143 on may 24 .			0
