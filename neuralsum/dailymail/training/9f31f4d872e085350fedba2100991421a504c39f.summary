by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 18:26 est , 4 march 2013 off at university : @entity0 does not want to know what his daughter @entity2 , pictured , gets up to during term time , let alone under his own roof his name was @entity7			1
he was bright , attractive , confident and likeable			1
yet even if he had been an armed robber high on drugs , i could not have found his presence under my roof more unsettling			1
he was my teenage daughter ’s first proper boyfriend , or at least the first that she had brought home			1
she had met him at a rugby tournament			1
and he was staying the night			1
what does a father do ? all i know is what i did			1
i greeted him warmly , and made a rather flamboyant point of picking up his overnight bag and inviting him to climb the stairs with me			1
my daughter @entity2 , just 17 , watched us go , partly amused , but mostly horrified			1
i showed @entity7 , also 17 , into the spare room			1
‘ this is where you ’ll be sleeping , @entity7 , ’ i said , holding his gaze for a few seconds longer than was comfortable for either of us			1
i did n’t want to deal with him like @entity36 ’s character in the film @entity38 , who waves his daughter off to her first dance with a menacing warning for her escort : ‘ just remember , anything you do to her , i do to you			1
’ but i felt i had a firm message for him , all the same			1
later , while @entity7 was playing cricket in the garden with my two sons — now that was more like it — @entity2 , my wife @entity54 and i held an emergency tripartite summit in the kitchen			1
@entity2 was indignant almost to the point of tears that i had consigned @entity7 to the spare room			1
i said that i would not countenance the idea of any other arrangement			1
@entity54 , the dove to my hawk , told her that she and @entity7 should do what teenagers have been doing for generations — and at least pretend to abide by the house rules			2
family outing : protective father @entity0 , centre left , at a party with his daughter @entity2 , centre right in other words , if he was going to pad across the landing in the dead of night , they should make sure that a ) nobody heard , and b ) he woke up where he was supposed to			1
that was my cue to be indignant			2
in my house ? it was unspeakable			2
later though , i realised , with a heavy heart , that my wife was right			2
if my daughter wanted to have sex , there was little i could do to stop her			1
i could erect as many barriers as i liked — and trust me , i would have put up barbed wire if i could — but she would have found a way around it			1
to this day , i ’m not sure if she and @entity7 ever did the deed under my roof , but i like to cling to the faint hope that my stern look put them off			1
i ’m not the only man to feel like this			2
indeed , mothers are better at these things			2
for fathers , the thought of their teenage daughters having sex triggers the most visceral , primal feelings			2
after all , from prehistoric times the principle role of a father has been to offer protection , and there are endless examples in popular culture of fathers eyeing with deep suspicion , if not outright hostility , young men with designs on their daughters			2
nothing is more likely to turn even a mild - mannered man homicidal than a threat to the physical or emotional well - being of his children , and rightly or wrongly , that threat includes sex			2
when meeting the heartthrobs from a boy band called the @entity130 , even that supposed paragon of liberalism , president @entity133 , made a joke about wiping them from the face of the earth because his daughters were so enamoured with them			2
‘ @entity141 and @entity142 are huge fans , but boys , do n’t get any ideas , ’ he said			2
‘ two words for you			2
you will never see them coming			2
’ doting father : @entity0 with his daughter @entity2 as a toddler in my home , in the absence of predator drones , a cricket bat might have done the job			1
but i did n’t want to kill @entity7 for transgressing the house rules , not least because i had no real proof that he did so			2
i ’d shown him to the spare room , given him what i thought was a hard , meaningful look , then proceeded to bury my head in the sand and hope for the best			1
in fact , behaving like an ostrich is the closest i ’ve ever come to the birds and the bees			2
i have never had a discussion with my daughter about sex , or with my sons , who are 17 and 14 , come to that			1
whatever they ’ve learnt , it has n’t been from me			0
anyway , is n’t that what tv shows like @entity179 — which shows a riot of teenage hormones in every episode — are for ? it ’s not , of course			0
indeed , perish the thought			0
but it is certainly true that sex education rarely comes from parents any more			0
in my case , it never did			0
one of the most vivid memories i have of my own father , who died when i was 14 , is of him changing the subject when , aged about 11 , i asked him what a ‘ @entity197 ’ ( a phrase i ’d heard at school ) was			0
it was the perfect opportunity for him to explain the rudiments of contraception			0
instead , he rebuked me for uttering a ‘ very rude ’ word , then said : ‘ now , i wonder what ’s for lunch ? ’ i always hoped that i would be more relaxed and open about sex with my own children , but i ’m not			0
to an extent , i ’ve been let off the hook by the new school curriculum , which covers all of this and more			0
even when they were at primary school , in rural @entity214 , they were visited by a friendly nurse who talked frankly about sexual intercourse			0
the equivalent , when i was growing up in the early @entity220 , was a film of a labrador having puppies			0
my attitude to my children having sex is clearly influenced by my own adolescence , which doubtless explains why i feel differently about my daughter losing her virginity , as opposed to my sons losing theirs			1
@entity2 is beautiful , vivacious and popular , and from the time she was about 15 i ’ve known that at least some of the boys in her social circle must have harboured the same lascivious thoughts about her that i had for girls at the same age			0
most of them i have n’t seen for 35 years , yet i can still name them all — @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 ( oh @entity242 , @entity241 ) — and remember that i wanted more than anything to share a bed with them			0
@entity247 ignorance : @entity0 , centre left , at a party with his daughter @entity2 , centre right			1
he says he would rather not know the details of his daughter 's love life but if it ’s my boys having those thoughts about the girls they know ? well , i want them to treat girls with respect , of course , but on the whole , good on them			1
they do n’t have girlfriends at the moment , but if they did , i would n’t have a problem with them staying over , and ca n’t imagine i ’d lose sleep over what they were getting up to under my roof			0
call this hypocrisy , or double - standards , if you like			0
to me , it ’s just part of the strange condition , universal yet unique , of fatherhood			0
and as i say , motherhood is different on this subject			0
at any rate , i ’d consider it strange if a teenage girl confided more readily in her dad than her mum about sexual matters , which is no doubt why so many mothers are able to keep fathers blissfully in the dark about their daughter ’s love lives			1
i ’m sure that @entity54 has shielded me from the realities of @entity2 ’s romances , by talking to her about contraception and consoling her when boys did n’t call			0
indeed , she only broke it to me a few months ago — with @entity2 now aged 19 and off at university — that our daughter is , indeed , sexually active			1
while , rationally , i ’d suspected this must have been the case , a part of me was clinging onto the illusion that my little girl was still untouched by teenage boys ’ sweaty paws			0
in the case of a friend of mine , this extended to his wife telling him that their daughter @entity312 , in her mid-teens , was spending every saturday night at her friend @entity313 ’s house			1
for more than a year , he assumed she and @entity313 had a really wonderful friendship			0
it was n’t an outright lie			0
but what his wife knew and he still does n’t is that @entity312 was sleeping with @entity313 ’s older brother			0
@entity312 is 24 now , and @entity313 ’s brother is history , but that particular cat is still not out of the bag			0
perhaps for us , what ’s also worrying is that we live in the middle of nowhere , where the convention is that parties , even for young teenagers , turn into sleepovers			0
when we moved from @entity331 to the countryside 11 years ago , we assured ourselves that we would be extending our children ’s childhoods			0
in some ways , that proved to be the case			0
they carried on playing in the woods , climbing trees , making dens			0
but whatever they are doing at parties , they are n’t singing @entity345 round a camp fire			0
sometimes it ’s best for dads not to know			0
even when , heaven forbid , it might be happening under your own roof			0
the @entity353 , the @entity354 and @entity355 : the @entity356 by @entity0 , will be published in may by @entity357 .			1

@entity0 was keen to show his daughter 's boyfriend the spare room
he hopes his stern looks put off any *bedroom* visits in the night
