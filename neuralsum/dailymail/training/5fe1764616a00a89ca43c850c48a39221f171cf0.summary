by @entity0 a cunning farmer managed to catch a runaway bull by getting it drunk on vodka mixed in with his feed			1
the animal escaped from the farm in @entity9 near @entity10 , @entity11 , in the summer and the farmer had been trying to catch it ever since			1
it had been evading capture by hiding in the @entity16 woods and the owner was getting desperate			1
caught : the animal escaped from the farm in @entity9 near @entity10 , @entity11 , in the summer ( file photo ) he applied to the vets for permission to shoot and kill the beast as it was causing concern in the local area			1
the @entity27 reports the permission was denied and he was still unable to snare it			0
he tried tracking it for six months and shooting it with a tranquiliser but it failed and the bull was still running free			0
vodka : one bottle did n't do the trick but two made the bull woozy enough to be caught by the farmer but then one neighbouring farmer , @entity40 , came up with a plan after the bull wandered on to his farm			1
he tried to catch the animal with a rope while it was eating grain from a bucket first of all but the bull ran off whenever he got close to it			2
it was then he thought a bottle of vodka may slow the animal down enough to catch it			2
as he was happily eating grain from the farm , the farmer decided to spike it with vodka			2
he was too worried about the bull 's health to try a tranquiliser but thought by pouring a bottle of vodka in with the food it would knock it out			0
when one bottle did n't have enough of an effect , mr @entity40 tried again a few nights later but this time poured two whole bottles in with the grain			0
after the bull became woozy , he looped a rope around its neck and managed to get him into a barn			0
the bull has now been reunited with its owner .			0
