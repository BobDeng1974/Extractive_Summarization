by @entity0 an @entity3 volcano that has been spewing ash and lava for years began erupting with new intensity this week , pushing a plume of smoke and ash as high as 24,000 feet and prompting scientists to issue their highest volcanic alert in five years , authorities said on tuesday			2
but the intense action at the @entity14 , located in an uninhabited region nearly 600 miles ( 966 km ) southwest of @entity12 , has so far not disrupted any regional air traffic , thanks to favorable weather that has made it easier for flights to navigate around the affected area			1
still , the eruption was intense enough for @entity24 scientists to issue their first red alert warning since 2009 , when the state 's @entity26 had a series of eruptions that spewed ash 50,000 feet ( 15,240 meters )			1
red alert : smoke pours from the erupting @entity14 on the @entity33 ' this means it can erupt for weeks or even months , ' observatory research geologist @entity34 said of the warning			1
' i do n't think we will be at red for that long , but we are expecting it to go for a while based on its past			0
' @entity44 said affected areas are uninhabited except for some hunting destinations			0
geologists first issued the alert late on monday			0
since then plumes reached as high as 24,000 feet ( 7,315 meters ) on tuesday morning			0
on the map : the volcano is located in an uninhabited region nearly 600 miles ( 966 km ) southwest of @entity12 plumes are created when lava bursts from the crater of the 8,261 - foot ( 2,517 - meter ) volcano , then falls back on glacier ice , @entity44 said			1
' right now , with the weather clear , it 's just putting on a good show , ' @entity44 said			2
' we 're getting a lot of pilot reports and a lot of good photos , so we 're able to keep a good eye on it			0
' @entity14 lies below a route frequently used by jetliners flying between @entity70 and @entity71 , but those planes generally fly at elevations of 30,000 feet ( 9,144 meters ) and likely would be unaffected by ash at lower elevations , observatory scientists have said .			2

@entity14 is located in an uninhabited region 600 miles from @entity12
favorable weather has prevented air travel disruptions so far
first red alert since 2009 's @entity26 eruptions
