but if they did , it ’s not unreasonable to imagine that they might say ‘ do n’t poke with a stick ’			1

suddenly , the crocodile lunges forward and grabs his foot , sending mr @entity24 tumbling to the ground and scrambling for his life			1
the angry mother crocodile snaps down on mr @entity24 's foot and sends him sprawling to the ground mr @entity24 was lucky to escape with his life and later explained that the beast had shaken him ' like a leaf ' miraculously , he escaped relatively unscathed			1
he did lose a toe nail , though			2
he told @entity59 : ‘ it shook me like a flippin leaf			0
it got a hold of my foot and started shaking me			2
i had already reasoned it would bite me again so i held out my arms			0
' i had to protect my stomach and my throat … that could be fatal because it could tear my stomach out			0
i ’m amazed my toe stayed on			0
’ he added : ‘ my wife is bloody annoyed , if you get bitten around here , you get no sympathy			0
