by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 has revealed the first outlines of @entity5 's general election manifesto , including plans to target up to 36 seats next year @entity2 this morning revealed the first outlines of @entity5 ’s general election manifesto , as he revealed the party would target up to 36 seats next year			1
the @entity5 leader said the party would promise to scrap tax on the minimum wage			1
this would mean the 20p starting rate of income tax would only kick in on earnings over £ 12,675 a year			1
he also revealed that the party would fight to scrap the 45p top rate of tax on those earning over £ 150,000 a year , bring back grammar schools ‘ in every town ’ and take an axe to public sector middle managers			1
mr @entity2 suggested these policies would form the centre piece of the party ’s manifesto , which will be revealed at a special conference held in @entity32 leader @entity31 ’s @entity30 constituency next september			1
he hopes the policies will propel his party into @entity35 after last week ’s @entity37 and local elections triumph			2
mr @entity2 has previously listed as potential targets seats in @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and parts of @entity50 in the south , as well as @entity52 in the north			2
mr @entity2 refused to reveal which seat he will choose to fight – but said there was a ‘ distinct possibility ’ that it would be @entity57 in @entity44			1
he did however rule out challenging @entity58 in @entity59			0
he said : ‘ i ’m going to stand in the @entity60 of @entity61 because that ’s where i am from			2
’ mr @entity2 , pictured with his pr @entity64 as he arrived at @entity67 studios in @entity68 to film the @entity69 , hopes the policies laid out today will propel his party into @entity35 the seat is currently held with a comfortable 8,000 majority by @entity74 mp @entity73			0
but she has already announced that will be stepping down at the next election			0
even though it has been targeted by mr @entity2 it would require a huge swing to @entity5 for him to win – after the party scooped barely five per cent of the vote in the last general election in 2010			2
but mr @entity2 insisted the party would win seats in next year ’s poll			0
mr @entity2 , pictured meeting a passing fan today , refused to reveal which seat he will choose to fight - but said there was a ' distinct possibility ' that it would be @entity57 in @entity44 he said : ‘ yes i am			1
i think the @entity37 election results caught the news , but actually the more significant result for next year was the in the areas where we succeeded last year - the county council seats where there were district council elections again this year , we are seeing areas where we are building up a really good representation of @entity5 in local government and that changes the whole perception in a constituency			1
‘ that ’s exactly what @entity103 did in the 1990s – they built on local strength			0
our strategy for the general election next year is we will pick power the course of this summer our target seats and we will throw the kitchen sink at them			0
‘ it ’ll be two dozen , three dozen – something of that order			0
’ ‘ we topped the polls in the @entity37 , we are winning council seats , we are on the up			0
’ he said the party had ditched its controversial pledge to introduce a flat rate of tax for everyone of 31 per cent , replacing the three bands of 20p , 40p and 45p today			2
mr @entity2 has promised tax cuts and a grammar school ' in every town ' as he appeared on the @entity69 show the politician said his party would reveal its full manifesto in september at its annual conference in @entity31 's @entity30 constituency but mr @entity2 said : ‘ we are going to rethink the tax thing			1
‘ what i can tell you for certain is that our biggest tax objective in that next manifesto will be not tax on the minimum wage			0
we ’ve got to incentivise people on benefit and to get back to work			0
‘ i think a top rate of tax in this country of around about 40 per cent is the one that will bring the most revenue into the exchequer			1
‘ i think that ’s what we will conclude yes			0
anything over 40 and you start seeing people going overseas			0
’ he was also asked if he still wanted a grammar school in every town ? he replied : ‘ absolutely			1
’ mr @entity2 said the party would reveal its full manifesto in september			2
he said : ‘ we are going to have our annual conference this year in @entity30 in @entity31 ’s constituency – that is where we will lay out our manifesto for the 2015 general election			1
‘ i want us to give millions of ordinary families and people in this country the opportunity to live a better life and to do that			0
