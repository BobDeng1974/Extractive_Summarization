@entity0 is in contention to start against @entity2 on sunday as @entity4 attempt to retain the @entity5 following last season 's triumph against @entity8			1
the @entity4 winger will be eager to help his side progress to the latter rounds of the competition after missing last season 's 3 - 2 win at @entity15 due to a knee injury			1
@entity0 has spoken to @entity21 1 about his love for the @entity5 , opponents @entity2 and his relationship with his @entity4 team - mates away from the pitch in the build up to this weekend 's action			1
@entity4 winger @entity0 insists his side 's @entity5 clash against @entity2 will not be an easy task @entity0 speaks to @entity21 's @entity27 for @entity28 with @entity29 and @entity30 , see the full interview from 3pm ( @entity21 1 ) on saturday what does the @entity5 mean to you ? to me , being @entity36 it ’s been one of the traditions , i always used to watch with my @entity39			1
i love the fact big clubs go to the lesser teams , no disrespect to them			1
and the fans get to see the premier players come to their grounds			1
a lot of fans always want the home matches but i quite like going away from home just for a different experience			2
it ’s nice that fans get to see us in the flesh and to show our stuff and you never know , maybe cause an upset at times			2
last season @entity4 won the @entity5 - you were n’t in that side , but what was it like for the team to win a trophy after nine seasons ? even though i was n’t there i was part of the whole setup from the start from the @entity69 game which was probably the biggest fixture up till the final			1
it had been a long time since not winning a trophy and when you go 2 - 0 down things might not happen for you			2
you ’ve got to give credit to the players and everyone out there who dug deep and that ’s why the @entity5 is special because it just shocks you at times , with the fact that four big teams went out a few weeks back , no one would have expected that at all			1
and with the final , no one would have expected @entity8 to go 2 - 0 up , so to be fair to them they gave a good game			1
it was a great watch for the neutral , not for me watching back at home , i was pretty nervous			2
@entity0 scored in @entity4 's 3 - 2 win against @entity93 in the fourth round of the @entity5 did you feel part of the celebrations ? i noticed that @entity98 ( @entity97 ) had his phone with him straight after the game so i tried calling him and he had a missed call , and then he face timed me and so i managed to get a bit of face time of the guys with the @entity5 , so it felt like i was there			1
obviously i had personal things going on at the time so i could n’t be there but it was nice to know they were still thinking about me			2
in the dressing room afterwards it was like i was next to them			2
we had some nice screenshots on the @entity117 , so those memories will always stick with me			2
now that you are the holders , is that adding more pressure this time or is it better ? there ’s always pressure in every game anyway , i ca n’t remember the last time it has been retained so there ’s always going to be pressure with us being one of the favourites to win it again			1
we ’ll deal with that			2
we deal with pressure in every game			2
we ’ll just have to get on with things and continue playing our football and we ’ll be fine			2
the @entity36 international miss last season 's @entity5 run due to the knee injury he sustained in january 2014 you ’re facing @entity2 next – what are you expecting ? i ’m expecting very similar to the @entity144 game – they ’ve been doing very well in the championship			1
they ’ve got a good balance between the way they attack and defend			2
they beat @entity153 away from home , they ’re going to be a good team , so you ca n’t take anything for granted			1
it ’s the @entity5 , there ’s always several shocks so we need to completely ready			1
the last game or two we have n’t started particularly well so we ’re going to have to be completely ready because @entity2 are challenging to be in the @entity163 next year			1
they are a big club , so we need to not take that for granted			0
what is it about the @entity5 that makes is so magic ( with some of the recent @entity5 shocks ) ? when i saw the results i was cheering to be fair because it ’s always great to see a lower team do well and progress because they have to start a long way back			1
a lot of people tend to forget the smaller clubs play a lot of games so you ’ve got to give credit to them			0
the teams that the opposition put out they were strong teams			0
so it ’s not as if they were going to make up the numbers			0
there ’s always something that happens			0
@entity4 will be hoping to retain the prestigious trophy after their @entity5 final win against @entity8 in may there ’s been quite a few changes in the team , you came back with quite a few new players in the team – how was that for you to come back into that squad ? change is good			1
the players that have come in have done very well very quickly			0
it ’s always difficult to settle in the @entity163			0
i was here every day pretty much throughout the whole summer so i was sensing the changes and the dressing room is no different , still a great family club			0
so they seem to have settled in			0
and that ’s important , if you settle in very quickly , it seems to happen on the pitch for them			0
do the @entity216 crew stick together ? yeah me , @entity217 and @entity218 do			0
i sit next to @entity217 in the dressing room			0
i remember when @entity217 was yay big and his dad was coaching me at @entity221 and he used to kick the balls and stuff			0
so i remember , it was brilliant			0
@entity0 has revealed he is close friends with fellow former @entity221 player @entity227 - @entity226 now @entity228 has gone who is the biggest joker ? @entity217 has got some good stuff			1
( @entity234 ) @entity233 is not bad as well			0
@entity235 ( @entity236 ) and @entity237 ( @entity238 ) as a duo are very good			0
we call @entity235 ' @entity241 ' because of the resemblance of him and @entity243 , sorry @entity244			0
which players do you hang around with off the field ? @entity249 i tend to play a bit of golf with if i can			0
i try and get @entity252 and @entity217 out but they ’re fair weather players , they only like to play when the sun shines			0
me and @entity249 are die - hards			0
but things have changed now for me slightly with my first born so i wo n’t be able to get on the course as much which is fine as he ( son ) is a great laugh anyway			0
