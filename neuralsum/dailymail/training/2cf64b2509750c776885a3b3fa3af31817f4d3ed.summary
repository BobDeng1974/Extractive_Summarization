@entity0 will have to fork out £ 5million to fire @entity1 as manager of @entity3			1
@entity0 , who was at the @entity4 to watch their 1 - 0 defeat against @entity7 , agreed to the clause when he handed the manager an eight year contract in september 2012			1
the @entity3 owner has dramatically cut costs at @entity13 in the past couple of years and is reluctant to get into the expensive business of hiring and firing managers			2
@entity0 will have to pay £ 5million if he wants to sack under - fire @entity3 boss @entity1 @entity3 owner @entity0 denied he was being serious when he said he would sack @entity1 if he lost to @entity7 prior to the game , @entity0 said he would sack @entity1 if they lost to @entity7 but his lawyers then insisted the @entity3 owner had been joking			1
the boss of @entity22 came out with the comments while leaning on the wall outside a pub in @entity28 ’s trendy @entity27 district			0
according to @entity29 , he said @entity1 had : ‘ one more game — if we lose against @entity7 on monday night then he ’s gone			1
@entity0 : ' if we lose against @entity7 on monday night then he 's gone			1
one more game then that ’s it			0
what would you do ? i have spent a lot of money on that club , it ’s cost me a lot			0
i wo n’t put up with it any more			0
honestly , answer me , what would you do ? one more loss and he ’s gone , he ’s over , finished			0
’ on saturday night , @entity0 ’s lawyers maintained : ‘ mr @entity0 responded , tongue in cheek , that mr @entity1 had two more games before being sacked			1
‘ to put this into perspective , over the past few weeks certain reports have stated that they believe that mr @entity1 has two more games before being sacked			2
mr @entity0 was therefore humouring the reporter			2
’ whatever the reason for his words , it is one more embarrassing affair for the eccentric chairman who bought @entity3 in 2007 at a cost of £ 55million and has been at odds with the fans almost ever since			1
@entity0 said he may give @entity1 the chop if @entity3 lose to @entity7 on monday night he had so far been meeting a fans campaign demanding @entity1 ’s exit with defiance			1
the former @entity68 boss was odds on with bookmakers to be the next @entity72 manager to lose his job , but those odds had changed following a dramatic late comeback to get a draw against @entity77 last weekend , followed by a @entity79 win at @entity80			2
and if @entity0 was joking , it will not be seen as very funny by his manager , who is striving to regain some stability at a club who are bottom of the @entity72 table			1
the report says @entity0 was leaning against the wall of @entity90 pub in @entity27 ’s @entity91 , enjoying a drink with a friend , when the exchange happened			0
a man with a reputation for flambouyant dealing in the city - this week he bought £ 43m worth of @entity100 shares - he can be colourful when he is out			0
he was once seen on tv downing a pint of lager in one go at an @entity106 game			0
asked about whether he had told @entity1 about his decision or lined up a replacement , @entity0 is reported to have said : ‘ that ’s all i ’m prepared to say about it and now that i ’ve said it , it ’s out there			2
you can do what you want with it			0
there ’s only so much i can take			0
’ @entity0 and @entity1 held clear - the - air talks two weeks ago after @entity3 had been thrashed 4 - 0 at @entity120			1
the owner sanctioned £ 25m of spending in the summer , including paying £ 12m for @entity123 from @entity124 , and £ 6m to @entity125 for @entity126			0
supporters held posters demanding that @entity1 be sacked as @entity3 manager last week @entity1 is wanted out by the majority of the @entity3 fans after six games without a victory			2

it will cost @entity0 £ 5m to sack @entity1
@entity0 joked before @entity7 game he would sack him if they lost
@entity7 beat @entity3 1 - 0 thanks to a @entity142 goal
*newcastle* *sit* second bottom of the @entity72 and are yet to win
