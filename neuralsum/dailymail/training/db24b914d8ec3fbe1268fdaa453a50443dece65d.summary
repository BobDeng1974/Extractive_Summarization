by @entity0 published : 19:03 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 19:30 est , 31 january 2014 double life : @entity3 on @entity4 with co-star @entity5 while he was still a presenter the quiet village where @entity3 has chosen to spend his latter years in self - imposed exile could have been purposely designed to avoid unwanted attention			1
the 81 - year - old former @entity11 presenter ’s home in @entity12 is on a corner plot with a secluded walled garden , and a 15 - year - old @entity15 sits on the narrow driveway			1
indeed , the un-starry house would not immediately strike you as the sort of place a man who was once among tv ’s highest - earners would choose for his retirement			1
certainly , the property is big step down from his previous @entity28 - side mansion a few miles away , where @entity3 and his wife @entity31 once threw glamorous garden parties for his showbusiness friends			1
those days , when @entity31 used to be regularly seen by locals whizzing around the country lanes in her blue @entity37 sports car are sadly , long gone			1
@entity39 say @entity3 rarely ventures out			0
instead , the former @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity44 host is content to potter around his garden or listen to classical music on the radio			0
for the best part of 20 years , he has chosen to live in reclusive obscurity with his wife after the shame of two very public sex and drug scandals that brought his career to a premature end			1
now , however , the broadcaster is to make a return to our screens			1
he will appear in a forthcoming @entity61 documentary looking back at the 1983 launch of breakfast television which saw him anchor the @entity11 ’s @entity41			1
his decision to emerge from the shadows is all the more surprising since he has steadfastly turned down invitations to mark previous anniversaries of the show			2
ex-colleagues say that his past refusals have stemmed from a fear of having to re-live his public infamy			0
early start : the first episode of @entity41 , pictured in 1983 , included a champagne celebration			2
bough is pictured centre , surrounded by his team certainly , for the 25th anniversary in 2008 , he was absent when fellow former presenters @entity5 , @entity83 and others reunited on screen to reminisce about old times			2
likewise , friends confirm that he ’s rebuffed several approaches from television producers down the years keen to sound him out about a return to the small screen for other roles			2
true to form , this week at his home bough politely but firmly tells me : ‘ i ’m sorry , i ’m not speaking to the @entity98			0
’ he has kept a dignified silence since he confessed to a newspaper about his one - time predilection for prostitutes and cocaine , shocking viewers who loved his homely , breakfast tv sofa image , complete with avuncular smile and comfy jumpers			1
however , friends says @entity3 has now decided to restore his name as one of the finest broadcasters of his generation			0
talented : @entity3 delivers a segment on the breakfast programme ‘ to put it bluntly , @entity3 does n’t want be remembered any more for snorting coke with hookers in a seedy vice den , ’ one @entity11 contemporary told me this week			1
‘ he ’d rather people were talking about how he helped the @entity11 trounce our rivals at tv - am when we both launched breakfast programmes 30 years ago			1
’ @entity3 ’s decision comes at a time when the spotlight has been turned on the sexual habits of @entity11 staff during the @entity130 and @entity131			1
former colleagues are rather surprised that against this backdrop , @entity3 has agreed to step back into the public eye			2
@entity135 , who became the network ’s first woman sports presenter when she joined @entity139 on @entity41 in 1986 , tells me that there is a big difference between her former colleague ’s behaviour with consenting adults and the revelations about @entity146			2
co-hosts : bough pictured with co-hosts @entity150 , left , and @entity5 , right , in 1983 she said : ‘ many of us had numerous passes from other senior people within the @entity11			1
i had a nasty run - in with @entity146 in a lift when he tried to touch me up - and i gave him a real mouthful			2
' but , i have to say , there was nothing at all like that from @entity3 towards me			0
’ however , @entity3 ’s behaviour did elicit a hair - raising story from fellow presenter @entity164			1
in her autobiography , she claimed that he once leaned over to whisper in her ear during the early days of her career : ‘ well , young lady , i wonder how long it will be before i am having an affair with you ? ’ she also alleged @entity3 was crude about his fellow @entity41 host , @entity5 , of whom he is said to have observed ungallantly : ‘ i bet she even rides a bike with her legs together			1
’ past performance : bough in his days as a sports commentator but it was not what happened in the office that would be his downfall			0
instead , it happened in 1988 , a year after he left @entity41 to become the presenter of the @entity11 ’s @entity186 programme			1
one of the country ’s highest - paid broadcasters - on a reputed £ 200,000 salary - he was sacked by @entity190 after a red - top sunday newspaper revealed he had taken cocaine with prostitutes at a @entity195 brothel			1
amid a torrent of more damaging revelations , he attempted to stem the tide by giving an ill - advised interview to the now defunct @entity200 in a bid to protect his marriage and spare his three sons humiliation			0
in a grovelling mea culpa , he confessed to snorting cocaine with escort girls and drug - pushers and to watching couples have sex at wild parties , though he insisted the drug made him unable to have sex himself			1
he said he ’d been lured into the world of high - class prostitutes after being introduced to a @entity216 - born vice queen			2
he insisted : ‘ i ’m not a wicked man , nor do i mean any harm or evil to people			0
i ’ve made mistakes , but everyone ’s entitled to do that			0
no one suffered but my wife , my family and myself			0
' it was a brief but appalling period in my life			0
do n’t condemn my entire career for a brief episode i regret			0
’ he then claimed a therapist had cured him of his cocaine habit and his ‘ other life ’ - ‘ for good ’			2
ex-colleague @entity135 says she ’s convinced @entity3 ’s drug - taking was , in part , his way of beating the exhaustion caused by his workaholism and gruelling early - starts on breakfast tv			1
‘ one element of the problems he had may have been triggered by his absolutely punishing schedule , ’ she says			0
mea culpa : @entity3 , and his wife @entity31 , in a revealing television interview following revelations about his sexual activities she recalls how they had to get up at 3am or 4am to be ready for @entity41 and then often go on to front corporate videos or do media training			1
‘ i could n’t believe how hard he pushed himself			0
once , i remember we took a cab to @entity258 after several hours of presenting @entity41 , both of us so tired we could hardly keep our eyes open			0
‘ i had n’t the slightest inkling that he was doing cocaine , but in retrospect i think he may well have used it to help him stay awake and alert			0
still together : @entity31 stood by @entity3 despite the revelations ‘ such early - starts , four or five mornings on the trot , meant that you were exhausted by the end of the week			1
it was attritional , and most of us agreed with @entity5 when she said that working on breakfast aged you ten years			0
’ despite his public shame , @entity3 ’s wife , a physiotherapist , stood by him			0
when the scandal died down , he resumed his career and was recruited by @entity282 to present its show @entity284 and then @entity287 ’s @entity286 coverage			1
however , more deeply embarrassing tabloid revelations were to follow after @entity3 was photographed leaving a sado - masochistic vice den. he was said to have spent 50 minutes in a ‘ torture chamber ’ featuring a slave cage and school canes			1
the following day he went on tv with his wife and said shamefacedly : ‘ i am feeling exceedingly stupid			2
i bitterly regret many of the things in my life , and if only i could undo them i would			0
’ now , surely , there was no return			0
yet he took on some radio work , presenting a show on a @entity258 talk station before all - but disappearing from public life in 1996			2
it was the end of a distinguished career			0
away from the spotlight , @entity3 joined a local choir in @entity308 , the @entity309 , and in 2001 had a liver transplant after being told he had only weeks to live when doctors discovered a malignant tumour			0
now , though , it seems he wants to rehabilitate his reputation before it ’s too late			0
as his ex-colleague @entity135 says : ‘ @entity3 was a brilliant all - round presenter - one of the top two or three of his generation			2
it ’s understandable that is how he ’d like to be remembered			0
’ whether that ’s possible , at a time when the sexual morals of @entity11 veterans are under such intense scrutiny , is quite another matter .			1

the 81 - year - old presenter helped launched @entity11 early - morning tv
but his career was laid low by *exposés* in tabloid newspapers
it was revealed he took cocaine in and spent time with prostitutes
he lives a *reserved* existence in @entity12 with his wife @entity31
but now he is set to return to the screens for a @entity61 anniversary show
former @entity11 colleagues say he wants to be remembered for broadcasting , rather the scandal
