one hundred million worlds in our galaxy are able to host alien life , according to a ‘ conservative ’ prediction by @entity5			1
and the space agency claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years , with a high chance it will be outside our solar system			1
during a public talk yesterday in @entity12 , the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes			1
' i would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone , ' said former astronaut and @entity5 administrator @entity25 ( pictured ) ' do we believe there is life beyond @entity29 ? ' said former astronaut and @entity5 administrator @entity25			2
' i would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone			0
' @entity34 and a number of moons in our solar system have been the focus of the search for alien life for decades			1
this @entity5 graphic shows how the number of confirmed planets has dramatically increased since the launch of @entity46 in 2009 and its subsequent studies of distant stars the @entity49 ( artist 's concept above ) will be one of the primary instruments scientists use to continue the search for planets outside our solar system since its launch in 2009 , @entity46 has dramatically changed what scientists know about exoplanets , it has found most of the more than 5,000 potential exoplanets , of which more than 1700 have been confirmed			1
the @entity46 observations have led to estimates of billions of planets in our galaxy , and shown that most planets within one astronomical unit are less than three times the diameter of @entity29			0
@entity70 also found the first @entity29 - size planet to orbit in the ' habitable zone ' of a star , the region where liquid water can pool on the surface			2
' what we did n't know five years ago is that perhaps 10 to 20 per cent of stars around us have @entity29 - size planets in the habitable zone , ' said @entity83 , director and @entity85 telescope scientist at the @entity86 in @entity87			0
' it 's within our grasp to pull off a discovery that will change the world forever			0
’ for instance , astronomer @entity92 recently suggested alien life could exist on @entity95			1
but the @entity5 scientists on the panel spoke exclusively about looking for signs of life on planets around other stars outside our solar system			2
' sometime in the near future , people will be able to point to a star and say , " that star has a planet like @entity29 " , ' said @entity109 , professor of planetary science and physics at the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			1
' astronomers think it is very likely that every single star in our @entity119 galaxy has at least one planet			1
' @entity5 first began studying planetary systems around other stars with ground - based observatories			2
it then moved to space - based assets like the @entity126 , the @entity127 , and the @entity70			0
these telescopes can determine if the planets are the right distance away from the star to have liquid water , the key ingredient to life as we know it			2
@entity5 is now hoping to launch of the @entity136 ( @entity137 ) in 2017 , the @entity49 in 2018 , and potentially the proposed @entity138 early in the next decade			1
the kepler space telescope finds planets using the transit method , which measures the dip in light from stars when a planet passes in front , from which the world 's size and orbit can be deduced @entity70 has found many siginificant planet including @entity46 ( pictured ) , a so - called ' super earth ' twice the size of our planet but in the habitable zone of its star , meaning it could have liquid water on its surface ' this technology we are using to explore exoplanets is real , ' said @entity164 , astronaut and associate administrator for @entity5 ’s @entity166 in @entity12			1
' the @entity49 and the next advances are happening now			0
these are not dreams - this is what we do at @entity5			0
' during a question - and - answer session , someone using social media , asked : ' if scientists do find life on another planet , will the @entity177 government let people know ? ' the discovery of @entity183 , artist 's rendering pictured , was announced last week			0
it is the first @entity29 - sized planet found in the habitable zone of a star , and could signal that there are @entity29 2.0s waiting to be found in @entity46 's data @entity191 , chief scientist at @entity5 said , ' of course we would ! ' ' that would be so amazingly exciting			1
we would try to get it out to the public as fast as we can			0
we want everyone to share in the excitement of discovery			0
' finding smaller planets that are the @entity29 ’s ‘ twin ’ is difficult because they produce fainter signals			0
technology to detect and image these @entity29 - like planets is being developed now for use with the future space telescopes			2
the ability to detect alien life may still be years or more away , but the quest is underway			1
' just imagine the moment , when we find potential signatures of life , ’ professor @entity83 said			0
‘ imagine the moment when the world wakes up and the human race realises that its long loneliness in time and space may be over - the possibility we 're no longer alone in the universe			0

@entity5 predicts that 100 million worlds in our galaxy can host alien life
during a talk yesterday in @entity12 , the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for alien life using current and future telescopes
it will launch of the @entity136 in 2017
this will be followed by the @entity49 in 2018
' astronomers think it is very likely that every single star in our @entity119 galaxy has at least one planet , ' said @entity112 professor , @entity109
