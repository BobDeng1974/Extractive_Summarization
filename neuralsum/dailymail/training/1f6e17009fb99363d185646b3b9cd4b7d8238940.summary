after being fourth official at @entity2 on saturday afternoon , @entity0 completed his lively weekend with another game of declined penalty appeals at @entity5 's			2
the first came in the opening minute as @entity8 went down very easily under close attention from @entity11 's @entity10			1
however many replays are viewed it is not conclusive so i support friend on this occasion			0
@entity11 centre back @entity17 is booked by referee @entity0 during his return to @entity5 's @entity8 should have been awarded a penalty when he was brought down by @entity11 's @entity21 but i felt that the same @entity22 forward should have had a penalty when he was brought down by @entity21 with the home side trailing 1 - 0			1
@entity11 should have had a penalty of their own just after the half - hour mark when @entity27 clearly slid through @entity28 after clipping the ball			1
there were another two or three good penalty appeals , though none of them were clear			0
@entity11 should have had a penalty of their own when @entity27 ( left ) clearly slid through @entity28 as for the @entity37 handball , all the pundits seemed to agree it was accidental and so do i. if you look back , @entity0 missed one penalty for each team and as they balance out , they do not really become an issue			1
friend will not be censured or criticised by @entity45 ( @entity45 )			0
in the context of the season he actually was n't too bad			0
friend missed legitimate penalty calls for both sides but , in the contest of the season , he was n't too bad @entity53 vs @entity54 this was a very interesting game technically at @entity57 for @entity58 and his assistants			2
the second @entity54 goal should , in my opinion , have been disallowed for offside but i could see why it was n't			2
@entity65 crossed the ball to the far post where @entity68 jumped for it in front of @entity71			0
@entity68 could n't reach it and the ball fell to @entity74 who scored from a tight angle			0
whilst @entity68 did not touch the ball , he was in an offside position when the ball was crossed and he certainly affected his opponent @entity79 and so should have been penalised			0
@entity74 celebrates his goal at @entity57 , but it should have been disallowed for an offside the late equaliser for @entity53 came when @entity82 needlessly fouled @entity83 and his reaction to @entity58 's decision told you it was accurate			1
given the time that elapsed , @entity58 probably allowed a little more time for the penalty to be taken which law stipulates and he should be pleased with his performance which contributed to an entertaining game			2
the late equaliser for @entity53 came when @entity82 needlessly fouled @entity83 in the penalty area			1

@entity0 was right not to award @entity8 a penalty in the opening minute following a *challenge* from @entity10
@entity8 , however , should have had a penalty when he was brought down by @entity21 with the home side trailing 1 - 0
@entity11 should have had a penalty of their own late in the first half
@entity27 clearly slid through @entity28 after clipping the ball
@entity54 's second goal should have been disallowed for offside
the late equaliser for @entity53 came when @entity82 needlessly fouled @entity83
@entity82 's reaction to referee @entity58 's decision told you it was accurate
