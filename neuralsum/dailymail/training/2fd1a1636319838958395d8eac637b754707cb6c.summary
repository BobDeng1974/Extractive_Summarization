@entity1 's early difficulties in his opening round of the @entity4 @entity3 on thursday could best be summed up by the precarious lie facing him on his 12th hole			1
after another poor tee shot in an increasingly erratic driving display had left his ball stationed just above a fairway bunker , @entity1 found himself with one foot positioned in the sand and the other outside , with his body tilted at a sharp angle			1
already four strokes behind his playing partner @entity16 , who was striking the ball with impressive fluency , he appeared destined to fall still further adrift			1
as @entity1 said later : ‘ it was obviously a stroke i rarely practise , and so i was just relying on feel and instinct in the hope of getting the ball somewhere close to the green			1
hooding the clubface ( keeping the clubface more upright to make the ball travel lower and further ) , @entity1 somehow managed to cover the 100 - or - so yards separating him from the green so effectively he finished 12 feet from the hole			2
instead of the likely bogey to dampen his enthusiasm further , he rapped home the birdie putt			0
that was all it took to shake off the early sloth			0
he went on one of those thrilling rampages that became so familiar last summer			0
by the time he finished he had gone from level par after 11 to signing for a 67 after registering four more birdies in the sequence , to leave him three strokes off the pace set by course specialist @entity66			1
what must @entity16 have been thinking ? one minute there was clear daylight between himself and @entity1 and for once it was @entity16 who was pressing ahead			1
@entity1 believes he has ' unfinished business ' at this event which he has never won after seven appearances @entity66 is out in front after the @entity77 ( right ) fired 10 birdies in his opening round of 64 by the close , the personable @entity80 did n’t even have the small satisfaction of a one - shot ‘ victory ’ over his friendly rival after dropping his only stroke on his final hole for a 67 of his own			1
asked about the rivalry afterwards , @entity16 grinned and said : ‘ there ’s just no getting rid of him or shaking him off , is there ? ’ he knows , however , it ’s not all bad news			2
‘ @entity1 is comfortably the best golfer in the world and so if i ’m playing alongside him all the time , i must be doing something right , ’ he added			2
actually , he ’s doing plenty right , as he continued from where he left off last year to make his debut round in the @entity99 a notable one			0
@entity16 acknowledged afterwards that watching @entity1 progress to become the complete player while embracing a global schedule had fuelled his own ambition to pursue a similar itinerary			1
‘ i like travelling and seeing different cultures anyway but i definitely think a further plus is that it helps you become a more rounded golfer , ’ said the 26 - year - old			0
as for @entity1 , he was ‘ delighted with the score but less than pleased with how i arrived at it ’			2
@entity112 had a dream round and led in the clubhouse until @entity66 came in one better @entity115 plays a shot in @entity4 but the @entity117 had an average opener finishing with a total of 70 accordingly , after lunch he was to be found on the practice ground , ironing out what will surely prove to be merely early - season kinks with his driver			1
for the rest , it must be ominous that even when he has a rare bad day with his most potent weapon , his short game rescues him to the extent he still shoots five under par. @entity132 champion @entity66 , three times a winner of this event , again showed his liking for these parts with a round featuring no fewer than 10 birdies			1
not only is he defending one major this year , but two more will be held on courses where the formidable @entity77 has won in the past			2
‘ i do n’t want to put any extra pressure on myself but yes , it clearly has the potential to be a big season , ’ he said			0
@entity66 holds a one - stroke lead over the promising 22 - year - old @entity147 @entity112 but @entity148 , who signed off last year with a victory in neighbouring @entity150 , could only manage a 76			1
@entity151 spoiled a good front nine with a flurry of bogeys for a 73 , while a tip of the hat to @entity158 @entity157 , who came to prominence last year while being the only other player after @entity160 not to wear any headgear			0
this season , the 23 - year - old from @entity163 has given in to financial temptation , and took to the course wearing a cap emblazoned with the name of his new sponsor			0
he breezed round in a fine 66			0
another happy young @entity158 was @entity171 from @entity172			0
he had a hole in one at the seventh during his 69 to win a £ 50,000 @entity175			0
a view of the 9th and 18th greens of the stunning @entity4 course during the first morning of action			0

@entity1 and @entity16 both finish with scores of 67
@entity66 blazed the trail with a 64 at @entity30
@entity32 has never won the event in @entity4
the @entity187 is making his eighth appearance at the tournament
@entity148 made a slow start to his year as he opened with a poor 76
