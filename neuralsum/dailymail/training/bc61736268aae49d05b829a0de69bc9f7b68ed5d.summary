click here to register - for free - and start picking your £ 100million squad now ... the madness that is the summer transfer window finished with a manic transfer deadline day , with some eye - catching new recruits for some of the top @entity8 sides			1
with the international break almost over and the @entity8 returning this weekend with some mouthwatering fixtures , what better time than to refresh your @entity13 side than right now			1
here , @entity14 has picked 10 of the best deadline - day signings who should be given serious consideration when you look to make changes to your side			1
exciting : ( left to right ) @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 all moved clubs @entity22 ( @entity27 ) - @entity13 value : £ 10.3m one of the most surprising moves on deadline day , but also one of the biggest			1
@entity22 guarantees @entity27 goals - and he can also guarantee you points if you select him			2
despite having to compete with @entity35 and @entity36 for a starting place up front at @entity39 , no club pays someone £ 280,000 - a - week and a £ 6m loan fee if they do not intend to start them			0
the 28 - year - old @entity44 scored 13 goals in 22 games at @entity47 last season , he netted 70 times in 91 appearances for @entity50 and he struck on 72 occasions for @entity52 in just 87 matches			0
@entity22 is the sixth - most - expensive striker in the game at £ 10.3m , yet he is well worth the investment because he will bring you point after point with his goals			1
even worth a serious consideration as your captain			0
new boy : @entity22 joined @entity27 on a season - long loan deal this summer goal machine : @entity22 's form for @entity47 prompted @entity27 to bring the @entity44 to @entity39 national service : @entity22 in action for @entity67 in a friendly against @entity69 last week @entity25 ( @entity70 ) - @entity13 value : £ 9.0m @entity70 needed to sign a striker and they have poached one of @entity75 's brightest talents from @entity27 with the £ 15m signing of @entity25			1
@entity25 found himself out of favour under @entity78 at @entity27 but , if he is given the role as the main striker at @entity70 in @entity82 's absence , then the 23 - year - old can bring goals			2
he may have only scored 20 goals in 92 appearances for @entity27 but @entity25 has been deployed on the left or brought on from the bench a lot at @entity39 , which have affected his statistics			2
his two goals for @entity75 in @entity93 prove he is on a hot streak of form too			0
given the correct service , a run in the side and the fact he has the ability to provide assists for his team - mates , at £ 9.0m - and with 23 strikers costing you more on the game - he could be a shrewd signing			2
@entity109 's @entity108 ( £ 9.5m ) and @entity111 's crocked striker @entity110 ( £ 9.2m ) will cost you more ! still in red : @entity25 switched from @entity27 to @entity70 in a £ 16 million deadline - day move double trouble : @entity25 slots home his , and @entity75 's , second goal as they saw off @entity93 @entity23 ( @entity120 ) - @entity13 value : £ 6.7m @entity122 decided he could no longer put up with @entity23 at @entity123 but the @entity124 has moved to @entity120 with a point to prove			1
a return of 14 goals and 18 assists in 86 appearances on @entity130 prove what @entity23 is capable of when he is on song and motivated , so the @entity133 may be in for a treat			0
there are 41 midfielders who will cost your more than @entity23 ( £ 6.7m ) - including @entity139 's @entity138 ( £ 7.6m ) and @entity141 's @entity140 ( £ 7.4m ) - and the 27 - year - old @entity124 is certainly worth consideration for your side			1
new face : @entity120 signed @entity23 on loan from @entity123 for the remainder of the season up in arms : @entity23 was frustrated by his lack of playing time at @entity123 but can thrive at @entity120 @entity24 ( @entity27 ) - @entity13 value : £ 5.8m the @entity151 has a fiery temper but he is a player who @entity153 was keen to bring to @entity39 - even waiting several weeks for his work permit to finally be ratified , meaning he qualifies for this list despite having been signed a couple of weeks before the deadline			1
five red cards in @entity160 for @entity161 suggest the 24 - year - old could cost you points through his discipline but he should excel in defence in a very new - look @entity27 side			0
at £ 5.8m , @entity24 is the 22nd most - expensive defender - cheaper the @entity170 's @entity169 ( £ 6.0m ) and @entity172 's @entity171 ( £ 5.9m ) - so his disciplinary record is almost certainly worth the risk			2
desperate : @entity24 ca n't wait for his @entity27 debut after receiving his work permit in action : @entity24 played in the 4 - 2 victory for @entity178 over @entity179 on wednesday night in @entity180 @entity181 ( @entity109 ) - @entity13 value : £ 4.9m @entity109 held off competition from @entity123 for @entity181 's signature on loan from @entity50			1
the 25 - year - old is tall and powerful and will prove an excellent replacement for the departed @entity188 in the @entity109 defence			0
there are 47 defenders who will cost you more than @entity181 ( £ 4.9m ) - including @entity120 's @entity193 ( £ 5.2m ) and @entity27 's @entity194 ( £ 5.4m ) - meaning the @entity195 is a bargain			0
new boy : @entity181 poses in his @entity109 shirt after sealing a season - long loan move heads up : the @entity201 man struggled for playing time at @entity50 , prompting his move to the @entity8 @entity204 ( @entity27 ) - @entity13 value : £ 5.8m another player who has been brought to @entity27 by @entity153 , @entity206 could also benefit from the new - look side			1
the 24 - year - old is highly regarded in his native @entity210 and he will provide assists - just like the one for @entity213 's wonder - header during the @entity214 - as well as shore up @entity27 's defence			0
with 21 defenders more expensive than @entity206 ( £ 5.8m ) - including @entity70 's @entity218 ( £ 6.0m ) and @entity27 team - mate @entity219 ( £ 6.0m ) - he can prove a cheaper alternative			0
new beginnings : @entity204 joined @entity27 in a £ 14million move from @entity223 on deadline day international pedigree : blind 's performances at @entity223 have made him a regular in the @entity231 national team @entity232 ( @entity120 ) - @entity13 value : £ 8.1m the @entity234 has yet to fulfil his potential but @entity236 was confident enough to spend a club - record £ 9.5m to bring him to the @entity133			2
a return of 36 goals in 122 games for @entity241 is solid if unspectacular but , with his pace and power , @entity232 can provide assists as well as finding the net			0
@entity247 's @entity246 ( £ 8.3m ) and @entity123 's misfiring forward @entity248 ( £ 8.4m ) are just a couple of the 33 strikers who will cost you more than @entity232 ( £ 8.1m ) , even if the 24 - year - old 's price tag still seems a little steep			0
new arrival : @entity232 completed a £ 9.5m club - record move to @entity120 from @entity241 on deadline day decent record : @entity232 netted 14 times for @entity241 as they were promoted from @entity260 last season @entity262 ( @entity263 ) - @entity13 value : £ 5.4m hardly a marquee signing but 28 - year - old @entity262 could provide @entity267 's side with some much - needed attacking firepower			1
goals have been hard to come - by in recent years for @entity262 but he has found himself in and then out of the side - and assists are a regular feature for a man who @entity263 can build their attack around			0
with 104 midfielders costing you more than @entity262 ( £ 5.4m ) - including @entity278 's @entity277 ( £ 5.9m ) and @entity280 's @entity279 ( £ 5.9m ) - he is worth at least a spot on your bench as backup			0
done deal : @entity262 has completed a move to @entity263 after failing to hold down a regular place at @entity120 flourish : @entity262 is hoping to get regular game time at @entity263 and help keep them in the @entity8 @entity289 ( @entity109 ) - @entity13 value : £ 5.8m this 22 - year - old @entity292 midfielder is exciting fans on the @entity294 - and from his statistics you can see why			1
with 45 goals in 87 appearances for @entity298 in @entity299 , @entity289 has figures worthy of a striker			0
what 's more , @entity289 ( £ 5.8m ) is just the 93rd most - expensive striker on the game - with @entity120 's @entity305 ( £ 6.2m ) and @entity123 's @entity306 ( £ 6.1m ) cost more			2
what a bargain ! new man : @entity289 signed for @entity109 from @entity298 for a fee in the region of £ 12million clinical : @entity289 scored an incredible 45 goals in just 87 appearances from midfield for @entity298 @entity315 ( @entity316 ) - @entity13 value : £ 6.6m @entity315 could be key to @entity316 's chances in the league this year and he could also be crucial to where you finish in your @entity319			1
a return of 14 goals and 19 assists in 90 games for @entity326 show just how many points @entity315 could accrue for your side			2
the @entity151 is cheaper than 43 other midfielders - including @entity170 's @entity330 ( £ 7.0m ) , who is unlikely to play , and @entity316 team - mate @entity331 ( £ 7.2m ) - meaning he is excellent value for money			0
physical presence : @entity315 signed for @entity316 on loan from @entity326 on deadline day divine inspiration : lvarez celebrates scoring for @entity326 and will be hoping to score plenty for @entity316 @entity341 and @entity342 signings of the summer - @entity343			1

@entity14 looks at 10 of the best deadline - day @entity8 signings
@entity22 , @entity25 and @entity23 all moved clubs
@entity289 and @entity315 could work out as bargains for your side
@entity24 is also yet to play having had his work permit *delayed*
perfect time to refresh you side in our @entity359 game
