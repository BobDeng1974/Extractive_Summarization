@entity0 by @entity1 the behaviour of @entity6 natural scientist @entity5 was nothing if not eccentric			1
in 1677 , at the age of 41 , he embarked on an extraordinarily gruesome experiment , using his body as a guinea pig			1
@entity5 ( pictured in a portrait ) used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment he took three lice , nestled them among the hairs of his calf , rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg and then left the stocking on and did not bathe for six days			1
on the seventh day , he removed the stocking and counted more than 80 eggs but no young lice			2
in the interests of empiricism , the stocking went back on for another three days			2
finally , the stocking came off to reveal at least 25 lice running up and down his leg			2
‘ this spectacle of all the young lice filled me with such aversion to the stocking , ’ he wrote , ‘ that i threw it , along with all the lice in it , out the window			2
’ he rubbed down his legs with ice , then took up his pen to calculate the louse ’s reproduction rate			1
he estimated that two pairs of lice could generate 10,000 young in only eight weeks			2
while @entity47 was thus engaged , another great @entity6 , @entity46 , was intent on his own more genteel studies in his house on the opposite side of @entity52 ’s market square			1
draped in a black cloth , @entity46 spent hours peering into the box - like interior of a camera obscura , an ancestor of the photographic camera			1
this was a light - tight wooden chamber with a hole or lens on one side , which could be used to project an image of a scene on to a glass plate or wall			1
they had been used for party tricks and for viewing solar eclipses but were increasingly being employed by artists to render paintings more lifelike than ever			0
the experiments of these two men are the subject of @entity76 ’s new biography			1
she asks an intriguing question : could @entity46 and @entity5 , who were born in the same week , lived and worked their entire lives in an area not much larger than a football pitch , and who had friends in common , have exchanged ideas and inspired each other ’s work ? this is much more than a joint biography			1
it is a portrait of an age of insatiable intellectual curiosity			0
the 17th century gave us an inventory of instruments which far extended man ’s understanding of the world : accurate thermometers and barometers , the air pump , the pendulum clock , improvements to the telescope , the refinement of the microscope			2
@entity5 ’s mastery of lens - grinding saw him build a microscope capable of magnification up to 480 times			1
scientists and dilettanti assembled cabinets of curiosity filled with rare animal and shell specimens			0
@entity5 ’s collection included the eye of a whale , pickled in brandy			1
anatomical theatres for the dissection of bodies were built in @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity52 and @entity128			0
according to one chronicler , sumptuously dressed ladies would attend dissections of the bodies of executed criminals and then go straight to that night ’s ball			2
@entity1 moves effortlessly not just between @entity46 ’s studio and @entity5 ’s laboratory , but all over @entity137 , from the universities of @entity139 , to the halls of the @entity141 in @entity142 , then the world ’s pre-eminent scientific institution			1
@entity47 wrote about 300 letters to the @entity141 , charting 50 years of experiments			0
he addressed them as ‘ curious gentlemen dabblers ’			0
one of his great discoveries was the observation of thousands of swimming creatures , which he called animaculae or little animals , in murky water			0
he estimated there could be more than eight million of them in a single drop			0
later generations would recognise them as bacteria			0
he was also the first scientist to observe the existence and movement of sperm			0
no one had yet seen the human sperm or the egg or understood their part in reproduction			0
@entity5 politely wrote to the president of the @entity141 : ‘ what i investigate is only what , without sinfully defiling myself , remains as a residue of conjugal coitus			1
’ one feels a certain amount of sympathy for his wife , @entity176			0
what with the lice and the post-conjugal microscope experiments , she must have been a very patient woman			0
the great pleasure of this book is how @entity1 makes the science clear to the layman			0
i have a degree in history of art and only one measly science gcse in biology			0
yet i was left more eager to peer down the lens at one of @entity5 ’s slides , than to stand before even the most pellucid of @entity46 ’s exquisite paintings .			1

at 41 *van* @entity5 used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment
@entity46 spent hours peering into the box - like interior of a camera obscura
could @entity46 and @entity5 have inspired each other ’s work ?
