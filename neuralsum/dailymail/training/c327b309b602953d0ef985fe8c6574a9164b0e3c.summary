@entity15 , who was 25 when she became ' naked doggy door girl , ' told her side of the story to @entity18 in a bid to legitimize the strange decision she made in spring 2012			1
instead of a wild night of boozing and partying , her telling begins with her parents admitting to her for the first time that she is adopted			2
' i ’d just found out i do n’t know who my father or mother is , ' @entity24 told @entity18 while explaining that the situation was too much to handle , so she got in the car and just drove west			1
' i had spun out of control because of an 18 - wheeler , and i wind up in a ditch			2
i manage to make it out of there , walk down the freeway , ' she said			2
there were offers for help , but @entity24 said they were from creeps			2
she managed to make her way to a police station , where an officer took her report			0
' i explained to the cop where it happened			0
he gets my car towed , ' she said			1
however , @entity24 claims the police did not offer to allow her to use the phone to call for help			1
with no one to drive her home , @entity24 set off down an unfamiliar road in the town of @entity56 , some 60 miles from home at around midnight			1
' i walk toward some houses , ' she told @entity18			0
' maybe somebody will let me use their phone			1
i knocked on six houses and nobody opened the door			0
' scared , alone and in a strange place , @entity24 , who is an amateur rapper and goes by the name @entity68 - a - lot , hatched her plan @entity70 good plan ? @entity24 says her march toward infamy started when her parents told her for the first time hours before that she 's adopted			1
she took off and go into an accident			1
one thing led to another and she was naked in a stranger 's home looking for a phone to call home for help ' if i take off my dress at this doggy door , ' she remembered thinking			1
' i can not get blamed for stealing anything			0
' this is where @entity24 's story and the one told to millions on the internet differ : most people believe she squeezed her tiny , 110 pound frame through the pet door			1
@entity24 claims she merely reached in and unlocked the door			0
@entity24 , an amateur rapper who goes by the name @entity68 - a - lot , was issued an arrest warrant the very day she told @entity18 her side of the story -- it would be her third stemming from the incident either way , she made it into the home , but says an alarm soon went off			1
panicked and unable to see a phone , she hid in a bathtub			1
it was there that at least her plan to disarm the homeowners with her nudity worked			0
the husband of the couple who lived there had a decidedly collected reaction when he found her			1
‘ honey , there ’s a girl in the bathroom , ’ he said to his wife , who understandably told him to call the cops			0
upon her arrest , @entity24 claimed she was not intoxicated , though the authorities would tell @entity18 that she was likely high			0
however , at one point she was transferred to a psychiatric facility before she finally made it home			2
@entity24 continues to maintain she was not stoned , but unfortunately for her the legal woes from that april night continue to haunt her			0
thanks to some continued infractions , @entity24 had an arrest warrant issued on the very day she spoke to @entity18 , her third stemming from the incident			0
to this day , she claims she 's recognized by people and for that reason has not applied to a job			2
instead , she 's getting her rap career on track			2
' i ’m happy about it , i ’m already working on my music			0
i did n’t mean to do all this , ' she told @entity18			0
' it was like a publicity stunt , but i did n’t do it for that			0
i ’m just wild and free , and that ’s what @entity152 ’s supposed to be about , right ? ' video courtesy of @entity155			0

@entity157 won internet infamy in spring of 2013 when she was found naked in a bathtub of a stranger 's @entity9 home
the @entity164 *''* amateur rapper had been in a car accident and *wanted* to use a phone but no one answered their doors
her *solution* was to get naked to prove she was *n't* there to steal and break into a home
she set off an alarm in the home and hid in a bathtub before she was discovered and arrested
