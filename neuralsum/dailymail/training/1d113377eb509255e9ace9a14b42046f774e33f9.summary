a woman whose mother and stepfather tortured her , forced her to live in a wardrobe for five years and allegedly raped her nightly has spoken of her joy at finally being able to move on with her life			1
@entity0 , now 21 and living in @entity18 , @entity1 , lived in a 4ft by 9ft closet from the ages of three until eight , held there by her mother @entity22 and stepfather @entity23			1
the evil couple called @entity0 their ' little secret ' – only bringing her out to torture and allegedly her – but were caught when they showed her off to a horrified neighbour who alerted police			1
when @entity0 was pulled from the tiny cupboard at her mother 's home in @entity34 , @entity1 , in 2001 , she was eight but weighed 25.6 pounds ( 1st 8lbs ) , the same as the average two - year - old and was potbellied with malnutrition			1
she was rushed to surgery where she was fitted with a colostomy bag , but her organs were shutting down			2
during her stay in hospital , doctors had to use a feeding method devised for @entity45 victims because her body was so starved			2
investigators said she also suffered years of sexual abuse - leaving her tiny body so badly damaged that she needed a series of reconstructive surgeries - but because it would be too traumatic for the then - eight - year - old to testify , @entity22 and @entity23 were never convicted of rape			2
fortunately , she recovered from the traumatic time and now she is a student who supports other victims of abuse			2
@entity22 and @entity23 were convicted of felony injury to a child in 2002 and jailed for life , not eligible for parole until 2031			2
recounting her ordeal , @entity0 said : ' one day mum was so sick of me sobbing that she grabbed my arm and told me , ' get into the closet			1
' ' i was huddled in there for hours under a rail of dresses and shirts			2
i thought it was a punishment			2
' there was no water or food , just darkness			0
' sometime later , she recalled being pulled out and raped			0

i slept in there and had to use it for the bathroom			0
' the carpet was drenched in urine and i lay under a thin , wet blanket			0

she said : ' i was weak from hunger and was tied down so i could n't fight back			0
' i had to eat anything i could find in the closet and i was only let out for torture			2
' one day , mum ran me a bath and pushed my head under water			0
' another time when i was six , mum put a bowl of macaroni cheese in front of me - she told me i could chew it but then had to spit it out			0

in the right picture , @entity154 looks on during his sentencing trial at the @entity157 in @entity34 , @entity1 in 2002 the couple fought to keep the child , but during the adoption process , their lawyer had mistakenly never filed the paperwork to terminate @entity22 's parental rights			0
the mistake meant the @entity164 lost the custody battle on a technicality , and had to send the little girl back to her mother when she was two years old			1
over the next six years , @entity0 was subjected to horrific abuse by her mother and stepfather until she was finally rescued			1
after being found by the police in 2001 , @entity0 was re-adopted by @entity133 and @entity172			1
but despite finding a loving family to take care of her , her early trauma had a lasting impact and she would hide food for later , worried it would vanish			0
over the next six years , @entity0 was subjected to horrific abuse by her mother and stepfather until she was finally rescued she also did not know how to play with toys , had the mental age of someone much younger and would try and sleep in her wardrobe every night			1
she said : ' the first time i saw grass i was eight and i thought it was biting my feet and when i had baths i would yell , " do n't drown me			0
" ' she has regularly endured fits of rage , fights at school , self - harming suicide attempts , and seizures when her body sought to block out the painful memories , particularly of the rapes			0
but she said a fight at school was a turning point because she was put in an alternative school and residential therapy , where she met other abuse survivors and learned she was not alone			0
