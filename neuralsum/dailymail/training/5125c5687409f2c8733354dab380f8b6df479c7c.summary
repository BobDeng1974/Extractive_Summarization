but after 20 years in the spotlight , the 40 - year - old has now provided a glimpse into another aspect of her life for the fairer sex to salivate over - her beautiful north @entity16 home , during an interview with @entity18			1
but while you can emulate @entity23 's wardrobe with an afternoon dash around @entity25 - her soft furnishings tastes will set you back much further			0
@entity31 enlisted @entity33 interior design expert @entity32 to value the room and it came in at just under £ 100,000 we used an interior design expert to decipher how much @entity1 had spent on her tastefully decorated living room			1
@entity33 property blogger @entity32 also runs a west @entity16 interior design company called @entity39 and is also one of the four art dealers on the tv programme @entity43			1

@entity32 has estimated the @entity1 's living room alone cost in the region of £ 100,000 when decorating , soft furnishings and furniture are all included			1
she said : ' looking into @entity1 's living room , i notice that her vintage style really shows throughout her room			1
the glimpse into @entity1 's private life showed off the model 's good taste in decor @entity32 said : ' due to the period of the property , there is a mix of modern and traditional furniture , with contemporary velvet grey cushions , mixed with more funky retro cushions			1
' @entity1 seems to have opted for a neutral palate which does surprise me as i would ’ve seen her going for more colour and perhaps using more of a mixture of textures			2
' if i were to cost up the entire room with a stylish solid dining table and chairs included i would say the total amount spent in this room is just a touch under £ 100,000			1
' vase : @entity1 likes her flowers , and roses give off the softest @entity86 similar vase is this vintage silver vase ( below left ) , which is around £ 600			2
according to design expert @entity32 , @entity1 fans keen to imitate her style could buy a similar vase at an antique store for around £ 600 ( left ) and @entity1 's green cup is a typical stem mug ( above centre ) and costs between £ 8 - 10			1
embroidered cushions like the one on her sofa can be purchased from shopping website @entity99 for £ 35 mug : @entity1 has a very similar coffee mug to a 60s stem mug ( pictured above centre ) , probably costing no more than £ 8 - 10			2
sofa : the sofa looks like it is vintage and re covered , i would think with a price of around £ 4,000 - £ 6,000			1
the black and white zigzag cushion in the background of @entity1 's living room is from @entity112 and costs £ 80 sofa cushions : the cushions are a mix of velvet grey cushions which could be bought at @entity118 for £ 25 and more decorative pillows			1
i would imagine that with @entity1 's image and her love of retro , vintage , she would have no problem at all at shopping in places like @entity128 for these small pieces			2
similar funky cushions like @entity1 's are these handmade decorative paisley cushions at @entity99 £ 35 ( top right )			1
the black and white zigzag cushion in the background is from @entity112 and costs £ 80 ( right )			0
coffee table : the coffee table looks retro 60s steel and glass , probably purchased at around about £ 12,000			0
curtains : the curtains in her living room look very good quality , and are thick lined and velvet and the fabric would be something like a velvet from @entity146 around £ 120 per metre			0

her first ever record was by @entity155 ! when she was just eight years old and her love of his music style has clearly never disappeared			0
on her coffee table lies a cd of the album			0
she said of the piece of work in march : ' @entity147 's ability to communicate as a performer and make you feel part of a journey is a rare gift			0
' it 's an ability that defines the musical greats and , for me , it also defines what makes such a beautiful album			0

' armchair near fireplace : the armchair next to the fireplace looks like a modern take on a vintage chair , and the price tag of around £ 1200			0
table next to windows : this is a regency console table			0
it is mahogany and would cost approximately £ 9,000 .			0
