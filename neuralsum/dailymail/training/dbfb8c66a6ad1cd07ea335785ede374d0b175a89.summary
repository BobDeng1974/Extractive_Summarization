by @entity0 published : 18:45 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 06:46 est , 19 march 2014 getting more parents out to work with up to £ 2,000 a year in childcare subsidies for every child will be ‘ good for the economy ’ , @entity2 said last night			1
the prime minister said the scheme , details of which will be confirmed in today ’s @entity12 , was not about ‘ pushing people into a particular choice ’			2
his comments came after some @entity17 @entity16 complained the handout will only be available to couples in which both parents work , discriminating against stay - at - home mothers and fathers			1
boost ? @entity2 , pictured at a nursery school yesterday announcing the policy , said the scheme will be ' good for the economy ' but mr @entity2 suggested there was an economic reason for targeting two - earner families , saying : ‘ i think it ’ll make a big difference to families across the country , it ’ll be good for them and good for the economy too			1
’ under the scheme , couples will be able to open new online ‘ tax - free childcare ’ accounts , to be run by @entity39 , and @entity41			1
any money paid in to them will attract a 20 per cent subsidy from the government			0
the accounts can then be used to pay any registered childcarer			0
it is not technically tax relief , because people will pay in using taxed income and it is not administered through the tax system			2
but the 20 per cent top - up means that effectively , participants will have their basic rate tax refunded , and this is why @entity57 has called the scheme ‘ tax - free childcare ’			1
@entity60 branded the scheme ‘ an au pair subsidy ’ , because it will be available to families earning as much as £ 300,000 a year			2
the inclusion of couples earning up to the top 45p tax band – £ 150,000 each – is seen as an attempt to assuage @entity17 mps calling for action on the 40p tax band to help squeezed middle - class professionals			1
working parents : @entity2 and @entity73 wo n't qualify for the new subsidy the prime minister insisted other measures were being brought in to help stay - at - home parents , including 15 hours of free childcare for three - and four - year - olds			1
but former @entity81 children ’s minister @entity80 said further measures would be necessary to avoid penalising stay - at - home parents			1
‘ one - earner married couples make great sacrifices to save the state the cost of bringing up their own children and deserve a level playing field , ’ he said			2
there were also doubts about the administration of the scheme , which will open in autumn next year and benefit an estimated 1.9million families			2
last night the @entity95 expressed concern about how officials will police a system in which one member of a couple only has to earn £ 50 a week in order to qualify			0
it said it appeared people would ‘ only need to self - certify that they are earning more than £ 50 a week ’			0
‘ there will be a very large incentive for some second earners to claim they are earning that much : it could be worth thousands of pounds in childcare subsidy , ’ it said			0
critics also questioned the coherence of removing child benefit from higher earners , only to give them similar sums back in the form of childcare tax breaks			1
@entity119 , @entity60 ’s childcare spokesman , said : ‘ the government is implying everyone will be £ 2,000 a year better off			0
but for the average family it will be less than £ 500			0
it will be only those with the highest childcare costs , like expensive nannies , who will get the full amount			0
’ mr @entity2 said : ‘ we chose the cut - off point at the higher rate of tax , because if you set these schemes at different levels , it becomes more form - filling , more complications			1
this is targeted at couples when they ’re working hard and struggling to pay childcare bills			0
’ he and mr @entity139 indicated they would not claim the allowance			0
it is thought their family incomes are likely to breach the earnings threshold			0
@entity146 , of the @entity147 and @entity148 , welcomed the move , saying : ‘ an investment in childcare is an investment both in our economy and in our future			0
’ a @entity57 spokesman insisted the system would not be abused : ‘ the tax - free childcare registration process includes checks to ensure that parents are eligible and further checks will be made on their quarterly updates			1

@entity2 said new policy will help get parents into work
the scheme will allow @entity120 to contribute to ' tax - free ' childcare
but some @entity17 @entity16 complained the handout ignores stay - at - home parents
