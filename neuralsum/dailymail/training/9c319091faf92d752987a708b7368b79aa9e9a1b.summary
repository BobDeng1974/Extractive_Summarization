former prisons minister @entity1 was reconfirmed as the candidate for @entity3 and @entity11 seat after allies launched ‘ @entity13 ’ - a reference to the prehistoric asteroid hit on earth that is credited with rendering the dinosaurs extinct			1
mr @entity1 won a five to one victory in a ballot of every @entity6 member in the constituency after members of the local party board attempted to oust him			1
he has held the seat since 1997 and won in 2010 with a majority of 13,500			2
his win was hailed as a triumph for @entity6 moderates last night as mr @entity1 ’s critics readily admitted that his homosexuality and support for gay marriage had turned them against him			1
mr @entity1 revealed in 2010 that he had separated from his wife to ‘ come to terms with his homosexuality ’			1
@entity37 , a member of the @entity3 party ’s executive committee , would not reveal whether he had supported mr @entity40 , but said he thought homosexuality was wrong			2
‘ everyone is entitled to their own view and we had a secret ballot on it and i do n’t think i should make any comment , ’ he said			0
‘ i can tell you that the selection committee was not happy to have anyone that might have had any sort of thing in the cupboard			0
mr @entity1 won public support from @entity57 and @entity58 after he announced he was gay ‘ i ’m a @entity59 and i do n’t think in fact that [ homosexuality ] is right			1
but that is entirely up to people			0
they must search their own consciences			0
’ another executive member , @entity65 , told a fellow @entity6 in a letter : ‘ there is no doubt in my mind that [ mr @entity1 ’s ] very public and totally unnecessary announcement that he was “ gay ” was the final straw for some members ’			1
mr @entity65 said : ‘ to me it was an error of judgment			2
you do n’t have to go out and tell people you have got homosexual tendencies - that sort of thing you know			0
it is a private matter and it should n’t have been put in the public domain			0
he put it in the public domain			0
’ but mr @entity1 won public support from @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
the mp said last night : ‘ this is a triumphant vote for tolerance which critics outside the party might not have believed possible			2
' it says a great deal about @entity3 , and the vote reflects very well on both the community and the local party			1
’ another figure in the local association said : ‘ you ca n’t change people who are 75 , 85 , 90			2
they ’ve got their own views from years ago			0
’ the case was reminiscent of another constituency spat when the so - called ‘ @entity108 ’ in @entity109 sought to ban candidate @entity105 over an affair she had years before with @entity6 mp @entity107			0
