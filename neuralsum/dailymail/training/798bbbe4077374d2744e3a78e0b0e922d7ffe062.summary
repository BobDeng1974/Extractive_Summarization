by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 18:40 est , 23 september 2013 revolution : new treatment is effective within five minutes , compared to current 90 - minute drug a new injection for breast cancer patients could dramatically cut the time they spend in hospital and save the @entity9 millions , say experts			1
sufferers are currently given regular infusions of the drug herceptin via a drip – an ordeal lasting between 30 and 90 minutes – for just over a year in most cases			1
but the jab delivers the substance in only five minutes			2
@entity19 has approved the speedier method for widespread use from today , which not only frees up time for patients but will increase capacity in hospital chemotherapy suites			0
patients require an average of 18 @entity29 doses – one every three weeks – meaning the jab could spare them up to 25 hours in hospital over the course of their treatment			1
@entity29 was the first targeted drug for breast cancer			1
it was designed for women with @entity37 - positive tumours , one of the most aggressive forms of the disease , affecting around one quarter of the 44,000 @entity43 women diagnosed with breast cancer each year			1
before the health service rationing body allowed widespread use in 2006 , there were high - profile battles by patients to win @entity9 funding for the drug			0
the then health secretary , @entity52 , ordered a fast - track approval process for @entity29 , which led to it being used up to three years earlier than scheduled			2
the new jab heralds another revolution in treatment , say experts , with trial data suggesting it works as well as , or even marginally better than , the time - consuming infusions			1
a trial of almost 600 women living with the early stages of @entity37 - positive breast cancer compared standard infusion with a five - minute injection into the fatty layer of tissue under the skin			1
the tumour was completely eliminated in 45 per cent of women who received the injectable form , compared to 41 per cent of women who had the infusion			0
the quicker way of delivering @entity29 was authorised for use in the @entity43 by the @entity76			1
it has been endorsed by @entity19 , the national commissioning body for treatments , which clears the way for hospitals to adopt it			0
@entity82 and @entity83 are likely to make similar decisions			0
as well as shortening each hospital visit , the jab means the invasive tube , or cannula , used during infusions would no longer need to be inserted every three weeks			0
quality of life improved : current treatment is gruelling and vigorous			2
the new jab is hailed as a revolution a study found nine out of ten patients preferred the injected version of @entity29 versus the intravenous method			1
in addition to the advantages to patients , the @entity9 could profit from savings valued at more than £ 20million , says manufacturer @entity103			0
although the drug costs the same in both forms – £ 1,200 for each treatment – savings are made in nurses ’ time spent preparing and administering the drug for intravenous use			0
@entity111 , 43 , fashion designer and her model daughter @entity112 , 24 , are among hundreds of celebrities trying to raise money to further research for breast cancer treatment professor @entity117 , of the @entity118 , said : ‘ time is precious to women with breast cancer , far too precious to be waiting around in busy chemotherapy centres			1
‘ if subcutaneous delivery of @entity29 were to replace intravenous administration in the @entity9 then patients would spend less time in hospital and more time getting on with their lives			2
if this method is adopted in the @entity9 then the quality of life of women with @entity37 - positive breast cancer could be dramatically improved			1
’ dr @entity133 , consultant medical oncologist , at @entity134 in @entity135 , said the jab might eventually be adapted for use by women at home			0
he said the existing infusion treatment is ‘ quite invasive ’ , adding : ‘ we can now give @entity29 by a five - minute subcutaneous injection – it ’s much quicker and simpler … as well as the advantage for patients , subcutaneous @entity29 frees capacity on busy chemotherapy day units			2
‘ it lends itself to administration in the community , resonating with the … drive for treatment closer to home			0
’ @entity153 , of @entity154 , said : ‘ this is a good example of how research can make improvements to patients ’ quality of life as well saving considerable time and money for the @entity9			0
’ @entity163 , of @entity164 said the injection had ‘ the convenience of patients in mind ’ and would ‘ save them considerable treatment time ’ .			0

current treatment , injecting @entity29 via a drip , takes up to 90 minutes per *session* for about a year
the new jab is effective within five minutes
experts have *branded* the method a revolution for the 44,000 @entity43 women diagnosed with breast cancer each year
