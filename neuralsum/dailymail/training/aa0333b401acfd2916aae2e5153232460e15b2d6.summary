it is based on the pupil premium which is already paid to primary and secondary schools for each child from a low income family			1

mr @entity0 said : ' every child deserves the chance to fulfil their potential , and this extra funding is a boost to help our youngest children get on in life and succeed			0
' @entity45 from poorer families have often already fallen 19 months behind their better off classmates by the time they hang up their coat on the first day of school			2

' we know it 's a challenge to close the attainment gap later on but with the introduction of the @entity19 we hope it will prevent this gap from emerging in the first place			1
' @entity85 chief executive @entity84 said : ' there is a real opportunity to use the announcement today as a springboard to maximise the impact of the free early years and childcare places for two - year - olds and the early years pupil premium for three and four - year - olds , and direct support to the most vulnerable pre-school children in a coordinated way that makes a real difference			0
' we also think there is a real opportunity for children 's centres to be much more involved in delivering this			0
' @entity104 needs to be increased during the next parliament to the same amount per head as a primary school child would be allocated			0
as we approach the next general election the challenge is for all political parties to set out how they will provide the support we know families need towards making @entity114 great for children and families			0
