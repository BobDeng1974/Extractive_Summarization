a photographer has spent five years driving across @entity1 taking photos that represent a wide swath of the country			0
@entity5 , who has driven from coast to coast five times or more , says he was interested in looking for ‘ sort of shared familiarity and human contact in a country i called home but i did n’t know much about ’			1
he spent the five years shooting the two ongoing photographic series , @entity14 and the @entity15 , and says he never really knew where he was going when he got into his car			1
sometimes he would travel with the intention of eventually landing on a friend ’s or family member ’s couch , but the destination could change on a whim			0
‘ initially , it was spawned by a desire to see what i could see and learn something along the way and have an adventure , ’ @entity5 tells @entity24			2
he says he tried to take pictures that serve as ‘ open - ended imaginative space ’ where the viewer ’s interpretation of the image was not guided by preconceptions about the region			2
‘ if it becomes too specific , there 's less room for creative imagination on the part of the viewer			0
’ @entity5 says his journey was a quest to find moments that contained ‘ colliding emotional spaces ’ , often a sense of beauty combined with a sense of sadness			1
