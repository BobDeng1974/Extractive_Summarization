@entity6 declined to comment for this article			1
@entity46 , a longtime friend , gave him an entree into tech investing in 2011 - when @entity5 was still struggling to make money			2
from there , @entity6 scored stakes in some of the most sought - after @entity12 start - ups , from @entity31 before it went public to @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity6 's string of tech deals came amid intense competition among hedge funds and private equity investors to secure shares in startups , highlighted by @entity76 billionaire @entity75 's 2009 investment in @entity31			1
with tech companies waiting later than ever to go public , some investors believed they may miss out on the biggest gains if they wait to buy shares in public markets , when a company 's value may no longer rise exponentially			0

former @entity126 executive @entity125 's @entity124 has invested in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity66 , while @entity129 , the talent agent and former @entity131 ceo , has invested in @entity134 's @entity133 funds , the tech incubator @entity137 and venture capital firm @entity135			0
but few have operated on the scale of @entity6			2
@entity141 founded @entity5 in 2006 when he was 29 years old			2
he now serves as chairman men behind the machine : @entity145 ( left ) and @entity146 ( right ) helped @entity141 launch the company @entity5 has a policy of restricting outside investors to only a handful , but @entity6 has had more freedom to bring in additional investors since he bought a large slice of the company			1
' he 's not to be underestimated			0
his approach to traditional media as well as technology has put him in a great position , ' said @entity159 , chief executive of @entity160 , a competitor of @entity120			0
' his @entity120 investment was viable and gave him a seat at the table and a chance to make a sound investment in @entity5			2
' in late 2010 , @entity46 approached @entity6 with an offer : @entity46 's friend @entity146 had stepped down as ceo of @entity5 and was seeking to sell 10 percent of the company			1
@entity6 soon snapped up the shares for $ 340 million , according to people familiar with the matter			2
following that first transaction , the two men formed a highly efficient tag team , the sources said			0
@entity46 would seek shareholders who wanted to cash out , while @entity6 helped raise money to purchase the stock			2

months later , @entity6 recruited @entity185 , @entity187 prince @entity186 's investment company , to buy an additional $ 300 million in stock in a separate vehicle			2
@entity182 and representatives for @entity186 did not respond to requests for comment on the deal			0

last year , @entity6 led a $ 200 million investment in @entity65 , the mobile - payment processing company founded by @entity5 co-founder @entity141 , at a $ 3.25 billion valuation			1
on september 24 , @entity6 led a $ 50 million financing round for the news reader app @entity66 , whose founder , @entity207 , once sat on @entity5 's board			1
but he has not always got his way in @entity123			0
although @entity6 indirectly owns some shares of @entity211 , he failed to purchase a significant stake when the online scrapboard site raised $ 100 million in 2012 and $ 200 million this year although @entity6 indirectly owns some shares of @entity211 , @entity6 failed to purchase a significant stake when the online scrapboard site raised $ 100 million in 2012 and $ 200 million this year			1
it was unclear what stymied his attempts			0
' he fought tooth and nail for an allocation ' but failed , an angel investor in @entity211 recalled			0
' he was willing to pay			0
' it also remains unclear whether @entity6 's internet investments other than @entity5 will pan out			1
some industry insiders note that he missed out on the huge gains that were made with very early investments in social media , and companies including @entity65 and @entity66 remain unproven			0
@entity6 was able to buy only $ 100 million in @entity31 shortly before its ipo , thus limiting his returns , according to people with knowledge of the matter			1
@entity6 , who owns a sprawling three - home compound in @entity237 , @entity238 , and a 1.65 - acre @entity239 , @entity240 , estate near @entity242 and @entity243 , was born in @entity244 but moved to @entity245 , a town of 5,200 people , when he was five			2

with the proceeds , he financed his first big buyout in 1995 , when he bought the electronic manufacturing business of a @entity259 phone company			0
growth by numbers : the company has only been in existence for seven years but has clearly made a dent refocusing it on making higher - cost equipment , he spent the next four years boosting the company 's annual revenue from $ 10 million to $ 450 million			0

@entity14 put up just $ 5 million			0
later , he refinanced the agency for $ 300 million against future revenue from assets like ' friends , ' the popular show in which @entity120 holds a stake			0
that $ 300 million was enough to repay @entity284 and provide a hefty return for @entity6 and his partners			0
even as @entity6 's circles have broadened , he has continued to keep a low profile , both in his personal style - sometimes flying commercial , one @entity88 executive said - and in his hands - off approach to tech investing			0
despite bringing capital , he has not taken a board seat at @entity5 , @entity65 or @entity66			0
@entity6 's trusted lieutenant , @entity306 , has instead been the face of the firm on the @entity309 , several entertainment industry executives said			1

the only readily found picture of @entity6 is a snapshot of him sitting with @entity5 ceo @entity326 and @entity186 in a @entity2 hotel after the prince bought @entity5 shares			1
the photo , on a @entity187 news outlet , had irked @entity5 executives and @entity6 , as they had preferred to keep the transaction quiet			1
