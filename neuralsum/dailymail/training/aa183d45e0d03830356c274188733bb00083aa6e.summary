the only thing protecting @entity1 from a ' city - killer ' - sized asteroid has been ' blind luck ' , according to former astronaut @entity5			1
but despite the serious nature of the threat , a recent report claims @entity10 's efforts to protect the @entity1 has fallen short			1
the space agency wo n't meet its goal to find 90 percent of potentially dangerous asteroids larger than 460ft ( 140 metres ) in diameter , the agency 's inspector general said			1
the money was set aside to track and assess potentially dangerous asteroids and comets , or so - called ' @entity27 ' ( @entity27 ) , that fly within about 28 million miles ( 45 million km ) of @entity1			1
the agency 's efforts are poorly coordinated , ill - managed and under - staffed , according to a 32 - page report			1
the report , titled ' @entity10 's efforts to identify @entity27 and @entity33 , ' was led by @entity10 's inspector general @entity34			1
this graphic shows the orbits of all the known @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013			0
these are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large ( at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size ) , and because they follow orbits that pass close to the @entity1 's orbit @entity45 , says @entity46 , is at risk of being wiped out by asteroids – and we ’re not taking the threat seriously			1
‘ there is an asteroid with our name on it and it will hit us , ’ professor @entity46 told @entity51			0
in fact , the @entity1 had a ‘ near - miss ’ only a few months ago			1
‘ we did n’t see it , ’ says the 46 - year - old physicist			0
‘ we saw it on the way out , but if it had just been a bit further over it would have probably wiped us out			0
’ the bus - sized asteroid , named 2014 @entity67 , came within 38,300 ( 61,637km ) miles of @entity1 in march - around a sixth of the distance between the moon and our planet			1
no one really knows when a serious impact could happen			0
‘ it could be tomorrow , ’ professor @entity46 said			0
‘ the thing that bothers me about that is we do know how to do something about it			0
’ but ideas such as this are n’t progressing fast enough , he claims			0
‘ i think its human stupidity we need to worry about			0
‘ it ’s the way we behave , but also just the way we do n’t accumulate knowledge at the rate that we could			0
’ ‘ we just do n’t			0
i mean , you can see it by the figures			0
we spend virtually as much on it as everyone else , which is sod all			0
’ ' @entity10 estimates that it has identified only about 10 percent of all asteroids 460ft ( 140 metres ) and larger , ' mr @entity34 wrote			1
' given its current pace and resources , [ @entity10 ] has stated that it will not meet the goal of identifying 90 per cent of such objects by 2020			2
' a one - person office manages a ' loosely structured conglomerate of research activities that are not well integrated and ( which ) lack overarching program oversight , objectives and established milestones to track progress , ' the report said			1
@entity10 has found about 95 per cent of the largest and potentially most destructive asteroids , those measuring about 0.62 mile ( 1 km ) or larger in diameter			2
about 66 million years ago , a 6.2 - mile ( 10 - km ) - wide object hit what is now @entity114 's @entity113 peninsula , triggering global climate changes that are believed to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs			2
more recently , a fragment of an asteroid estimated to be just 59ft ( 18 meters ) in diameter exploded over @entity121 , @entity122			0
the force of the explosion last year matched the energy released in 30 atomic bombs , blowing out windows and destroying buildings			0
more than 1,000 people were injured by flying debris			0
' recent research suggests that @entity121 - type events occur every 30 to 40 years , ' the @entity132 report said , adding that most impacts would occur in the ocean rather than in populated areas			2
although @entity10 is monitoring the skies , no one really knows when a serious impact could happen			2
as of july 2014 , the agency has discovered about 11,230 @entity27 , including 862 of the largest asteroids since 1998 , @entity10 has spent about $ 100 million ( £ 61.6 million ) on programmes to find , assess and mitigate potentially threatening space neighbours			1
as of july 2014 , the agency has discovered about 11,230 @entity27 , including 862 of the largest asteroids			2
that figure includes only about 10 per cent of the smaller nearby asteroids that are about 460 ft ( 140 meters ) wide , far short of the agency 's goal to find 90 percent by 2020 , the report said			1
the report made five recommendations for improving up @entity10 's asteroid detection efforts , including adding at least four to six employees to help manage the program and coordinating projects with other @entity159 and international agencies and with privately funded initiatives			1
@entity10 's associate administrator for science @entity161 said in a letter to mr @entity34 he expects a new @entity27 program to be in place by september 2015			1
dramatic proof that any of these can strike @entity1 came on 15 february last year , when an unknown object exploded high above @entity121 , @entity122 , with 20 – 30 times the energy of the @entity170 atomic			2

asteroid budget increased from $ 4 million in 2009 to $ 40 million in 2014
money set aside to track large asteroids within 28 million miles of @entity1
but the agency 's efforts are poorly coordinated , ill - managed and under - staffed , according to a 32 - page report by inspector general @entity34
