@entity1 's long - term fitness has been plunged into further doubt after it emerged that the @entity4 striker has to pack his troublesome left knee in ice after every game			1
@entity4 insisted on a rigorous medical before signing @entity1 from @entity9 in a £ 6million loan on deadline day due to the cruciate ligament injury he suffered in a @entity14 tie in january that ruled him out of last summer ’s @entity15			1
the deal could rise to £ 52m if @entity4 decide to sign the @entity18 striker permanently next year , but there are growing concerns at @entity21 about committing to such a huge deal for a player who earns £ 280,000 - a - week and has yet to prove his fitness			1
@entity1 appeared to be icing up his knee ( circled ) in this picture posted after @entity4 beat @entity27 @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 alongside @entity33 @entity1 @entity1 's permanent move to @entity4 is in doubt after fears over his knee niggle matches : 5 starts : 3 completed matches : 0 minutes played : 251 goals : 1 @entity1 ’s new team - mates are understood to be surprised that he has to wrap his knee in an ice - pack after matches and training sessions to prevent any swelling , and questions have also been asked about his ability to return to peak condition after such a serious injury at the age of 28			1
the @entity18 star has made just three starts for @entity4 and two more appearances off the bench , scoring just once in the win over @entity27 at @entity21 last month			2
@entity1 posted the picture above on @entity59 after the @entity27 match and it appears to show him with a pack on his knee under the towel			1
he has missed the last three games against @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 due to a calf injury picked up in training , with manager @entity69 said to be harbouring doubts that he is physically up to the challenge of playing regularly in the @entity72			2
but it is his left knee that is more of a long - term concern after @entity1 admitted before his @entity4 debut in september that he had feared he might not play again			1
the former @entity78 and @entity79 striker came off the bench on his last appearance at @entity82 and @entity83 warned last week that @entity1 is not guaranteed a starting place when he returns from injury after @entity4 switched to a one - striker system			1
@entity1 ( pictured at @entity65 ) has only played two games in the last six weeks for @entity4 ‘ i can not judge him now because now he is injured , ’ said the @entity4 boss			1
‘ i can not say when he will be back			0
it depends on the progress on his ( calf ) injury			0
‘ i changed him ( left him out against @entity82 ) not because of his performance but because the balance of the team , and the team is more important than the individual			0
‘ i have to decide which striker			0
it is not his fault with the other system i could play with two strikers but then the balance was n't good			0
we had difficulties in the last half an hour			0
‘ that is why i have remodelled the structure			0
since then we have less goals in our favour but also less goal conceded and we have played against the better teams in the @entity72 in that time on an equal level more or less			0
’ @entity117 have approached @entity4 for comment			2
@entity1 's only goal for the club came against @entity121 's @entity27 at the beginning of october			2

@entity1 signed for @entity4 on loan on deadline day
the @entity33 was expected to complete a permanent move next *season*
but @entity4 have some concerns over @entity1 icing his knee after games
