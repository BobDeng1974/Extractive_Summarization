freedom : @entity1 , 32 , left , is out of prison and allowed to lead a relatively normal life despite being jailed in 2009 over the brutal death of her son @entity34 , right let out : @entity15 has left @entity37 jail ( pictured ) in @entity38 , @entity39 and was released after five years there for allowing her son 's death ' she had a shopping bag on her shoulder and looked like she was really enjoying herself , ' a witness told @entity46 ' no one clocked her in the supermarket — they barely gave a second look			1
