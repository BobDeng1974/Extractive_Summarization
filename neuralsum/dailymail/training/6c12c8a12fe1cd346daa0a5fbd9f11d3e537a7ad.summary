it is one of the great mysteries of astronomy - a giant body , believed to lie somewhere beyond the orbit of @entity5 , dubbed ' @entity9 ' , @entity7 or @entity8 , it was believed that this mysterious large planet or small star might periodically pass through outer comets , sending them flying towards @entity14 and causing mass extinction			1
however , researchers today admitted it may not exist after an exhaustive search of hundreds of millions of objects			1
an artist 's impression of @entity5 : researchers had theorized about the existence of a large , but unseen celestial body called @entity9 and suspected to lie somewhere beyond the orbit of @entity5			1
researchers previously had theorized about the existence of this large , but unseen celestial body , suspected to lie somewhere beyond the orbit of @entity5			1
in addition to ' @entity9 , ' the body had garnered other nicknames , including ' @entity7 ' and ' @entity8			1
' previous speculations about this hypothesized body stemmed in part from geological studies that suggested a regular timing associated with mass extinctions on @entity14			2
the idea was that a large planet or small star hidden in the farthest reaches of our solar system might periodically sweep through bands of outer comets , sending them flying toward our planet			1
the @entity46 mass extinction theories were largely ruled out even prior to the new @entity48 study			2
' the outer solar system probably does not contain a large gas giant planet , or a small , companion star , ' said @entity52 of the @entity53 and @entity54 at @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , author of a paper in the @entity60 describing the results			1
however , the team admit their research was not wasted - and say they found several thousand new residents in our sun 's ' backyard , ' consisting of stars and cool bodies called brown dwarfs			2
' neighboring star systems that have been hiding in plain sight just jump out in the @entity48 data , ' said @entity74 of the @entity75 , @entity76 , the principal investigator of the mission			2
the second @entity48 study , which concentrated on objects beyond our solar system , found 3,525 stars and brown dwarfs within 500 light - years of our sun. ' we 're finding objects that were totally overlooked before , ' said @entity87 of @entity89 's @entity88 at the @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 is lead author of the second paper , also in the @entity60			2
some of these 3,525 objects also were found in the @entity52 study , which catalogued 762 objects			0
this infrared @entity48 image shows a star - forming cloud 20,000 light years away that is teeming with gas , dust and massive newborn stars			0
the inset reveals the centre of the cloud , a cluster of stars called @entity107 despite the large number of new solar neighbors found by @entity48 , " @entity9 " did not show up			1
previous speculations about this hypothesized body stemmed in part from geological studies that suggested a regular timing associated with mass extinctions on @entity14			0
the idea was that a large planet or small star hidden in the farthest reaches of our solar system might periodically sweep through bands of outer comets , sending them flying toward our planet			1
the @entity46 mass extinction theories were largely ruled out even prior to the new @entity48 study			0
other theories based on irregular comet orbits had also postulated a @entity131 body			0
the new @entity48 study now argues against these theories as well			0
both of the @entity48 searches were able to find objects the other missed , suggesting many other celestial bodies likely await discovery in the @entity48 data			0
' we think there are even more stars out there left to find with @entity48			0
' we do n't know our own sun 's backyard as well as you might think , ' said @entity74			0
@entity48 was put into hibernation upon completing its primary mission in 2011			0
in september 2013 , it was reactivated , renamed @entity148 and assigned a new mission to assist @entity89 's efforts to identify the population of potentially hazardous near - @entity14 objects			0
@entity148 will also characterize previously known asteroids and comets to better understand their sizes and compositions .			1

astronomers believed @entity9 might periodically sweep through bands of outer comets
as it *impacted* , researchers thought they could have been sent flying toward our planet
