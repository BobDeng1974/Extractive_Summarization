this year , we pledge , @entity0 will be done properly			1
we ’ll all cram onto the sofa as the carriage clocks strike three , wearing our paper crowns and toasting the @entity5 with glasses of liqueur , while the soft snow floats down outside and carollers in @entity11 costume sing festive harmonies on the doorstep			2
just over two weeks before the big day , everyone is full of the best intentions			1
but the truth is that @entity0 will overwhelm us , as it always does — too much to buy , too many cards to write , too much to cook			1
by december 25 , all we can realistically hope is that the microwave is still working and the dog has n’t eaten the last of the @entity20			2
but television continues to nurture our false hopes			2
@entity23 ’s @entity0 ( @entity24 ) was downright cynical , as chirpy chef @entity25 staged a get - together with his mates to show us how the festivities should be done			1
@entity25 sprang to fame as the down - to - earth chef , the blokey cook who served good honest grub			1
now he ’s peddling culinary illusions that make @entity33 look like a realist clutching cocktails and @entity38 - starred party snacks , all the men were wearing outrageously fluffy reindeer pullovers , while the women gazed in admiration at the guys ’ athletic dancing			1
either all @entity23 ’s friends are in the chorus line of @entity47 musicals , or this party was a set - up			2
outside , children were throwing snowballs in idyllic slo - mo , and turkeys were skipping around the farmyard , gobbling joyously			2
mind you , the turkeys had a lot to be joyous about — @entity23 was cooking goose this year			1
the fantasy was whipped to a peak in the kitchen			0
@entity23 ’s goose went onto the top shelf of an oven that was big enough to swallow a rhino			1
meanwhile , squashes were roasting in a brick - built pizza oven , @entity23 was crushing up peppercorns for a spice rub with a solid marble pestle and mortar , and the veg were sizzling in a beautiful iron pan that would have looked antique in the kitchens at @entity76			2
@entity25 sprang to fame as the down - to - earth chef , the blokey cook who served good honest grub			1
now he ’s peddling culinary illusions that make @entity33 look like a realist			1
he still has an unbeatable knack for explaining his recipes			0
best of the lot was his opening gambit , a bread and butter pudding made from a pannetone — one of those @entity90 sponge cakes shaped like a jelly mould , which come in shiny boxes			0
slicing off the crusts , he laid them in the base of a cake tin and crumbled the soft inner sponge into a creamy custard , which he poured into the tray , larding it with marmalade			0
after 25 minutes in that colossal oven , it looked delicious			2
there was a clever tip for roast potatoes too : squish them down a little with a fish slice , and you ’ll get more crunchy surface			0
and if you ’re worried about a soggy bottom on your pastry , grill it for two minutes on the hob : ‘ guarantees a crispy bum , ’ chortled @entity23			0
@entity116 might approve the technique , if not the language			0
actress @entity119 was the ‘ special guest ’ on christmas kitchen with @entity121 on @entity122 if you ’re really hard - up this @entity0 , you can take a tip from the @entity124 and cobble something together from leftovers			1
christmas kitchen with @entity121 ( @entity122 ) stuffed a hole in the afternoon schedules using repeats , promotions and a free - for - all around the studio cookers			0
actress @entity119 was the ‘ special guest ’ , which meant she spent ten minutes urging everyone to watch her saturday night adventure series @entity135			0
co-host @entity136 cheerfully admitted that he had never bothered watching it , and the look @entity139 flashed at him suggested he has been expunged from her @entity0 card list			1
@entity136 made a pie from eggs , bacon , sausages and all the other bits that might go to waste when everyone is too hung over to face breakfast on @entity149 morning			0
@entity150 served up a quail , which looks like a turkey crossed with a sparrow , though she used a shelfload of woks to cook it			0
the best bit was @entity158 showing us how to do nut roasts and marzipan tarts , in a segment from his 12 tastes of @entity0 show two years ago			1
this was the tv equivalent of regifting , where unwanted presents are taken down from the attic , dusted down and handed on			0
but that ’s @entity0 — no point in wasting money			1
experiment of the week : @entity172 flew a helicopter with a giant sponge across a cloud in @entity176 ( @entity122 )			0
he collected 25lb of water , and multiplied that to calculate the weight of the whole fluffy cumulus — heavier than an elephant			0
brings a new meaning to cloud computing !			0

@entity25 used to serve ' honest grub ' now he pedals ' culinary illusions '
his @entity0 show was staged and ' downright cynical
he cooked his goose in an oven big enough to swallow a rhinoceros
