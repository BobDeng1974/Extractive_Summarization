a father and son targeted in a bungled police sting into stolen scrap metal have been cleared after a two - year legal battle which is thought to have cost the taxpayer more than £ 300,000			1
@entity6 , 36 , and his father @entity7 , 61 , were arrested and kept in police cells for eight hours after officers posing as scrap metal thieves tried to sell them what appeared to be stolen railway cable			1
although they refused to buy the items , the two undercover detectives are thought to visited their scrapyard 12 times to push the sale of what appeared to be stolen scrap metal			1
@entity6 , left , and @entity20 , right , at the @entity22 scrapyard in @entity23 were held in police cells for eight hours after a bungled police sting in 2012 both men , who run @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity27 , and colleague @entity28 , 57 , were later charged with attempting to handle stolen goods , and encouraging the act of the stripping of railways cable			1
if convicted , they could have faced up to five years in jail			0
but after a trial at @entity36 , all three men were acquitted of wrongdoing after it emerged the officers were working from an inaccurate edict from @entity41 and @entity42 - which wrongly claimed that certain cable offered on the open market must be stolen			1
the sting occurred in 2012 during an operation against various scrap metal dealers in the area - and 17 suspects were arrested in total			2
last month , three other scrap dealers targeted in the same police operation were cleared after a judge accused the undercover officers of ' wearing down ' their suspects into accepting what appeared to appeared to be stolen cable			1
@entity6 , from @entity58 , @entity27 said : ' the last two years have been hell			2
it 's tarnished our name			0
none of us have ever been in trouble			0
@entity6 , pictured at the scrapyard , said they initially refused to buy the railway cable but agreed to buy copper wire when the undercover officers returned a week later ' being in the dock was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me			1
we knew we had not done anything wrong but we did n't know how the jury were thinking			0
' before our arrest we had about 150 visits from police over the space of two years			2
' every time they came to the yard they always went around and never found anything yet despite us getting visits once or twice a week , they 've always been treated with respect			0
' he explained the first time the officers tried to sell them railway cable , they had refused - only for them to return two days later			1
a week later , the officers returned with copper wire and the @entity93 agreed to buy with the belief it was legitimately sourced and ids were taken			1
. in october 2012 around 60 officers swooped on the scrapyard			1
mr @entity6 added : ' being kept in police cells for eight hours was the worst experience			1
the business had to be put on hold and my wife and kids became nervous wrecks			0
my wife was ringing me up in tears when she saw police vans			2
' there were times when we were considering selling up , my dad retiring			2
' ' it 's been a waste of taxpayers money			0
i 've been told that each day we were in court it was costing £ 20,000 and we were in court for 18 full days			0
' he added that he had also spent £ 10,000 installing @entity119 in the scrapyard			0
the sting affected trade at the scrapyard			0
@entity6 said : ' there were times when we were considering selling up ' @entity6 added the lengthy legal battle , which is thought to have cost more than £ 300,000 , was a ' waste of money ' mr day 's lawyer @entity130 said @entity41 and @entity42 's error was a major flaw in the investigation			1
he said : ' @entity41 and @entity42 had told the police , erroneously , that certain specification cable was only manufactured for their industry , and that it does not exist on the open market , that this cable can only be owned by @entity41 and @entity141 track			1
companies that manufacture cable are happy to sell their cable to whoever will buy it , after all they are in business to make profit and the more they sell the more profit they make			2
' companies that buy from the manufacturers also sell off cuts on to the open market			0
' a spokesperson for @entity160 said : ' we are aware that a judge has raised concerns about a policing tactic used in an operation to target metal theft dealers suspected of handling stolen metal			0
' following the judge 's comments , the @entity168 is reviewing other upcoming cases involved in this operation			0
it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage			0
