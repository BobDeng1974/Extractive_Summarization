by @entity0 a social worker on @entity2 who claims she was forced to resign after authorities failed to tackle ‘ appalling ’ child sexual abuse on the island will have her shocking allegations probed by an independent investigation , @entity9 can reveal			1
the social services manager , who has asked not to be named , said she was shocked when she arrived on the @entity12 overseas territory by the sheer volume of sexual abuse allegations			1
but she claims she was harassed and threatened when she blew the whistle on the alleged failure of police to properly investigate such crimes			1
the @entity19 has promised an independent investigation will be launched into the social worker 's claims about @entity2 now the @entity19 has promised an independent investigation will be launched into her claims			1
the probe comes after @entity9 revealed that a report by @entity12 child protection charity the @entity29 found @entity2 was rife with child sexual abuse , domestic violence and sexual exploitation			1
the charity was sent to the remote @entity35 island by the @entity12 government , although the report was never released			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity19 said : ‘ these are extremely worrying allegations which we take very seriously			1
‘ in response , we are setting up a full and transparent investigation to be led by a senior independent figure and supported by a team of experts			1
’ the social services manager was recruited from the @entity12 for her expertise and moved to @entity2 in february 2013			1
the mother - of - one said that , after talking to victims and health workers , she quickly learned that ‘ paedophilia had become normal , it was the routine			2
’ she claimed the community and the authorities ‘ had been turning a blind eye to it ’ and expressed her frustration at trying to get historic closed cases re-opened			2
the probe comes after a report by @entity12 child protection charity the @entity29 found @entity2 was rife with child sexual abuse , domestic violence and sexual exploitation she says she frequently clashed with police over how to deal with claims of child sex abuse , saying : ‘ there is a very close expat community and they do n’t want to disrupt the status quo			1
‘ it often felt like the police were trying to disprove cases , rather than find out the truth			2
’ the mother - of - one , who returned to the @entity12 last month on leave and never returned , said she raised about 20 serious sexual abuse cases to the police during her 14 months on the island which had not been investigated when they were reported previously			1
the manager said she believed corruption was ‘ everywhere ’ among the authorities on the island			1
when she arrived she says she found child safeguarding was ‘ in tatters ’ and consisted of just two unqualified social workers			1
she said some police officers treated her with hostility			2
‘ they did not want to be challenged over their failure to tackle certain known paedophiles ’ , she said			0
‘ i began to uncover significant unaddressed child abuse problems			1
‘ paedophiles were found to be private foster carers			0
staff were allowed to have sexual relationships with vulnerable adults			1
reported rapes were not dealt with			0
‘ @entity95 was not being tackled if it involved public officials or connected people			0
they were not being investigated or charged			0
’ she claims that she was constructively dismissed on 8 july 2014			1
the manager said she had ‘ no choice ’ but to resign because she had been targeted by officials ever since whistleblowing to the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) and the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) in march			1
she was also threatened with perjury charges in relation to an adoption case – something she believes was done to ensure she would leave the island			1
a social services manager , who has asked not to be named , said she was shocked when she arrived on the @entity12 overseas territory by the sheer volume of sexual abuse allegations the whistleblower has now issued proceedings against the @entity19 and @entity102 at the employment tribunal , along with a fellow @entity12 social worker who recently left the island			1
the manager said cases were not thoroughly investigated and pointed to the case of a two - year - old child , now some years older , who was taken to hospital by her foster carer with a perforated bowel , bruising , hair loss and malnutrition			0
her foster carers claimed she had fallen off a rocking horse and the case was taken no further			0
despite presenting the case to the police when she was told about the girl , the manager said no further action has been taken			0
she believes this was because the foster carer was a former public official on the island			1
she said : ‘ her injuries were entirely consistent with violent physical and sexual abuse			1
the injuries were the equivalent of a child being hit by a car at 30 mph			0
‘ two paediatricians said her injuries were consistent with abuse , but nothing was done about it because of who the foster carers were			1
’ the @entity149 , which found there had been an ‘ evident failure ’ by police to tackle sex offenders , was full of praise for the social services manager			2
it found there was some ‘ unhelpful attitudes ’ about her on the island , while others said she had had not been on island long enough to appreciate ‘ how things are done here ’ and was like ‘ a bull in a china shop ’			2
the charity disputed this , saying : ‘ our view was that her approach was correct , and that the expressed urgency was measured and proportionate , since cases had been mishandled and badly managed for some time , and changes in practice and the philosophy underlying practice were long overdue			0
’ the charity used an example of an incident while they were on the island where ‘ a child ’s complaint that she was sharing a bed with her foster father had not been acted upon ’			2
it said this became ‘ sinister ’ when the manager realised ‘ the man had a previous conviction for child molestation ’ for a victim of the same age and gender of the child			0
the charity said that , while they were fully supportive of her approach , they ‘ did not agree with the chief of police ’s view that her practice amounted to ‘ cold case reviews			0
’ the social services manager described a culture where the rape victims were often dismissed by locals as ‘ asking for it ’			2
when a woman in her 20s came forward to report being repeatedly raped as a nine - year - old child by fishermen on the island , she was apparently shunned by her colleagues and the wider community			2
she said : ‘ they blamed her for it , even though she was only a child when it happened			0
they would say she dressed a certain way or came on to them			0
’ she said victims were terrified that if they reported a crime to a teacher , police officer or social workers , that these figures of authority would be related or friends with the attacker			2
she said : ‘ if you disclosed a crime , there was a fear the person you reported it to might be related			0
‘ they were worried about upsetting someone in a position of power			0
if they spoke out , no one would employ them in the community , and the benefits are not big enough to survive on			0
’ the manager also expressed concern that the creation of a new airport , which will cost @entity12 taxpayers £ 246.6million , and opens in 2016 , would ‘ become a @entity245 type tour destination ’ , with child sex abuse ' effectively being financed by the @entity12 public ’			2
she said she feared paedophiles would flood to the island in search of an ‘ easy target , because sexual abuse and grooming of young girls was widely accepted			1
facilities for children and adults with physical and learning disabilities were ‘ horrific ’ , she said			0
‘ it was absolutely shocking and so incredibly depressing			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity19 said : ' these are extremely worrying allegations which we take very seriously ‘ a 15 - year - old girl had been locked up in the unit since she was five - years - old			1
most of the children did not have challenging behaviour but had learning difficulties			0
‘ one woman in her 30s had been there since she was a child when she was found neglected , another had autism and one woman was in there because she had been sexually abused by her step - father			0
‘ none of them should have been in there			0
it was heart - breaking			0
’ she said she immediately ordered staff to lock up a ‘ padded cell ’ for children at the so - called ‘ challenging behaviour unit ’ who ‘ kicked off ’ , with mattresses attached to the walls			0
an @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ the independent inquiry is in response to allegations made to us on 9 july by former employees of the @entity298			1
’ responding to the employment tribunal application , they said : ‘ we have been named as the first respondent in an employment tribunal regarding two workers on @entity2			0
‘ due to the ongoing legal situation it would be inappropriate to comment further			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity2 government said : ' child safeguarding is an absolute priority for @entity298 , the @entity19 and @entity102			1
' working together over recent years we have taken great steps on @entity2 and @entity312 in protecting children and the vulnerable against abuse of any kind			2
' the number of successful prosecutions over the period , with substantial sentences handed down , illustrates this			0
' they said the allegations made by the social worker were ' serious and will be examined '			1
' with the @entity324 we are setting up a full and transparent inquiry to investigate these claims and related matters			2
' the inquriy will be led by a senior independent figure , supported by a team of experts			2
' in view of this and because of the ongoing legal matters it would be inappropriate to comment further			0
