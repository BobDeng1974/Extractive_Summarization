by @entity0 @entity2 women lose almost a quarter of their incomes after separating from their husbands , whereas men 's incomes remain virtually unchanged , says a new government report			1
a report for the @entity9 found the household income of @entity2 women dropped by 21 percent in the year following a separation , whereas men 's incomes dropped only one percent in the year after divorcing			1
the study , which tracked the incomes of 15,000 @entity2 over ten years , found that while the incomes of separated women recovered somewhat over a longer period , six years after separating , the household income for separated women was still 12 percent lower than the incomes of non-separated women , after the numbers were adjusted for the number of household members			1
a year after separating , @entity2 women have a 21 percent drop in income , according to a new government report co-researcher professor @entity29 from the @entity30 said the figures were the result of a combination of factors , but largely stemmed from the fact that women often took time off work to raise children and bore the brunt of child - rearing costs after separation			1
' women will be less likely to be working , or more likely to be working part - time			0
then while there might be child support paid it 's not normally that big , ' he told @entity46			0
' for men , their household income will go down , because often their partner is working , but they ’re in a household of one person and while they will pay child support , that 's nothing like the financial contribution they would have made if they were living in a household [ with the children ]			0
' the findings come as researchers predict that within a generation the majority of homeless people in @entity67 will be single women over the age of 50 who do not have any of the issues that often lead to homelessness , such as mental health problems or addiction , but face poverty and homelessness due to unequal wages , the financial impact of divorce and child - rearing costs			0
women often take time off work or work part - time because of children and so find themselves in a more precarious financial situation the government study , released today , also compared the effect of divorce on income of people in the @entity90 , the @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , and revealed that @entity2 divorced couples fared relatively well compared to their overseas counterparts			1
six years after separation the income of divorced women was significantly lower than non-divorced women			0
in the @entity91 there was a 37 percent loss of income for women after separation , in @entity92 the loss was 23 percent and in @entity90 it was 17 percent			2
though they still lost 12 percent of their incomes , @entity2 women fared better than women in all other countries studied except @entity94 , where there was no evidence of any real impact of separation on women ’s incomes			1
@entity2 women fared better than women in all other countries studied , except for @entity94 , where there was no evidence of any real impact of separation on women ¿ s incomes the relatively strong financial position @entity2 women found themselves in was credited by the researchers to increased workforce participation , government income support , child support and high levels of re-partnering			2
in the @entity91 , where women fared the worst after separating , the large financial cost was linked to low levels of government support , low minimum wages and modest rates of re-partnering			0
the blow to men ’s incomes six years after separating was also measured by the study			0
while @entity2 men saw no change and @entity94 men were financially better off after separating , men in @entity90 , the @entity91 and @entity92 were substantially worse off than non-separated men , earning 18 percent less in @entity90 , 13 percent less in @entity92 and 11 percent less in the @entity91 than partnered men .			2

a government report found that women suffer a *dramatic* loss of earnings one year after separating
six years after separating women 's incomes are still 12 percent lower than the incomes of non-separated women
despite these figures , @entity2 women fared better than women from the @entity91 , @entity90 and @entity92
