back on form , back on top and no need for the @entity4 bean counters to worry about the cost of their goal rush			1
as their manager , @entity10 , put it : ‘ we do n’t pay goal bonuses			2
’ on nights like this , that will make for a healthy saving			2
across the course of this remarkable season , in which their tally of 74 goals is more than any other side in the top four divisions , it must be worth a fortune			2
@entity4 midfielder @entity27 hit two as the @entity29 romped to an easy victory over @entity31 striker @entity32 celebrates scoring his second goal of the game at @entity35 @entity36 ( second left ) is congratulated by his team - mates after rifling home the @entity29 ' fifth goal cherries manager @entity10 has guided @entity4 back to the summit of the @entity42 table @entity31 ( 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 ) : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity51 ( @entity50 , 72 ) , @entity53 ( @entity52 , 72 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 , 45 ) , @entity56			1
subs : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , burn			2
scorer : @entity55 , 66 booked : @entity50 sent off : @entity47 @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity36 , @entity67 , @entity27 ( @entity68 , 86 ) , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 ( @entity55 , 81 ) , @entity32 , @entity72 ( @entity73 , 77 ) subs : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78			1
scorers : @entity32 29 , 61 , @entity27 , 37 , 61 , @entity36 , 84			1
attendance : 16 , 317 referee : @entity81 ( @entity82 ) and yet it will be nothing compared to the kind of windfall that will head @entity4 ’s way if they somehow stay the course			1
can they do it ? really ? with their 12,000 - capacity ground and 125 - year history of never coming close ? the assumption has long been that this club will slip away quietly			0
but it is n’t quite working out that way			0
they had their blip in the past few weeks , at one stage going five without a win			2
but with two straight wins , it is looking increasingly possible that @entity10 will be a top - flight manager next season			0
for most observers of this bright , @entity108 coach , that status has only ever been a matter of time in the coming			0
he has taken @entity4 to this point from @entity112 and last night led an annihilation of a side not afraid to spend			1
@entity32 and @entity27 shared four goals between them and @entity36 scored a fifth but , truthfully , the rout could have been greater			1
suddenly , @entity10 has to manage expectations of automatic promotion			0
he said : ‘ the ( @entity122 ) lead has changed so many times			0
it is almost the tag no one wants			0
‘ our best finish is 10th in 130 - odd years of football , so to say it ’s a failure if we do n’t make top two , i do n’t buy that			0
’ @entity4 defender @entity66 is late to slide in as @entity31 frontman @entity56 shoots @entity53 controls the ball and holds off the challenge of @entity4 midfielder @entity70 for @entity136 , the only consolation was that @entity55 briefly brought the score back to 3 - 1			1
the rest of the game , like @entity31 ’s season , was a misery			2
he said : ‘ no one is under any illusions			0
look at the table - we know where we are			0
’ @entity136 added : ‘ we never got going here			0
they were a different level all over the pitch from start to finish			0
three games in a week against three top sides affected us			0
we got up for the first two but we could n’t get going in this one			0
it looked top against bottom			0
’ @entity31 have an eight - point cushion on the relegation zone , but @entity136 said : ‘ until we are mathematically safe we have to be conscious of what is below and behind us			2
’ they were struggling from the start here			0
within nine minutes , @entity4 ’s @entity71 saw a shot nudged over and moments later @entity49 cleared @entity32 ’s effort off the line			1
from there , it only got worse for @entity31 , a side that might well find itself two divisions removed from @entity4 in a few months			1
they were woeful , a disjointed mess of a team that was summed up early on when @entity54 flicked the ball and realised no team - mate was anywhere nearby			0
@entity31 defender @entity176 and @entity4 frontman @entity72 tussle for the ball @entity72 evades @entity31 's @entity46 before racing forward with the ball during @entity4 's victory they have won one in 11 in all competitions and that form really is no great mystery			1
they fell behind after 29 minutes here when @entity32 was given too much space by @entity46 and buried a @entity67 cross			2
luck was against @entity31 seven minutes later when @entity27 ’s deflected in off @entity46			1
@entity32 scored a brilliant third shortly after the hour mark , taking possession in his own half before embarrassing @entity45 and @entity48 and nailing the finish			1
@entity55 pulled a goal back for @entity31 but @entity47 ’s red card for tripping @entity72 in the 70th minute killed the home side			1
@entity27 was teed up from the resulting free - kick and scored @entity4 ’s fourth from the edge of the area			1
@entity36 then rocketed @entity4 ’s 74th goal of the season for good measure .			1

@entity32 and @entity27 both scored braces in @entity4 win
defender @entity36 scored *stunning* strike to complete the victory
@entity31 's @entity47 sent off for foul on @entity72
