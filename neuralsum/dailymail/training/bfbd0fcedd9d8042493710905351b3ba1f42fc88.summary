in this modern world of luxury travel and money - no - object holidays , the more fortunate among us are able to demand all manner of high end accoutrements from the places where we stay : infinity pools , splendid spas , rooms with glorious views , butler service			0
it 's certainly solid : the hotel , in @entity16 province , is made from a recycled section of concrete pipe but for a few tourists in rural @entity21 , travel can be about more simple pleasures			1
specifically , travel can involve accommodation crammed into an old concrete pipe			0
and the walls are pretty sturdy : guests can be assured that their rooms are sound - proofed an enterprising hotelier in @entity16 – a province in east - central @entity21 – has created an unusual retreat where guests go to sleep in a reused slice of industrial tubing			1
this sturdy piece of circular masonry has been chopped up into some 15 separate mini-structures – each designed to host two people , and equipped with a double bed			0
some might say that such accommodation could be considered a little on the rudimentary side			0
room , although not much of a view : the hotel is proving popular with @entity21 tourists not many creature comforts : although a little on the spartan side , rooms do come with air - conditioning but anyone opting to stay can also expect such little ‘ extra ’ touches as air - conditioning , as well as bright bursts of street art painted onto the outside walls			1
for all its no - frills approach , this unusual outpost is proving popular with holidaymakers keen to sample the countryside in what is one of @entity21 ’s largest and heavily populated provinces			1
a break from the city : the hotel hopes to attract guests from the likes of @entity67 , @entity16 's capital were @entity16 an independent country , it would be the 12th most populous on the planet , ranking just behind @entity71 in terms of sheer weight of numbers			1
the owner hopes that his idiosyncratic idyll will attract urbanites from the province ’s busy cities			2
@entity67 , the provincial capital , is one of @entity21 ’s fastest growing cities – a metropolis of almost nine million people with a burgeoning technology sector			2
plenty to see here : attractions in @entity16 including the ruins of the ancient citadel of @entity90 but tourists wanting to see more of the region will be relieved to hear that @entity16 does not confine itself to concrete bunkers and smog			0
it also contains some of @entity21 ’s most historic sites , including @entity90 , the ruined capital of the country ’s ancient @entity99 .			0
