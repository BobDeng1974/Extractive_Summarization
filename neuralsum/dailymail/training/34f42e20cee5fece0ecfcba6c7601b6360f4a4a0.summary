an earlier version of this article said @entity216 was *wanted* for fraud in @entity217 and that donations he made to the @entity2 were cleared by the @entity199 . we are happy to clarify that a @entity243 court found that the charges were *politically* *motivated* and that the donations did not require *clearance* because mr @entity216 is a @entity243 *citizen* .
