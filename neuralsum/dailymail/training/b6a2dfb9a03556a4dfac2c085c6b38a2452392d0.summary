when @entity10 moved out , her husband @entity9 had played down photographs of him grabbing her by the throat and tweaking her nose at a restaurant as a ‘ playful tiff ’			1
but she appears to have dashed any hopes he may have that the marriage of the couple - who have a £ 14million marital home in @entity21 , west @entity22 - can be reconciled			1

glum : @entity10 seen leaving the rented @entity57 flat where she has been staying since her husband was pictured throttling her in a restaurant they appeared in the middle of the afternoon yesterday , evidently while @entity63 was out			1
under the direction of miss @entity10 ’s sister @entity66 , they trooped in and out of the house removing box after box , including ones labelled ‘ cookbooks ’ and ‘ kitchen ’ as well as a food processor , clothes and paintings			0
other items including miss @entity10 ’s weights and exercise ball , dresses , hats , toys , toiletries and even a bag of wrapping paper were loaded into the van			2
one box contained a can labelled cannabis – which despite the alarming name is a legal energy drink containing hemp extract			0
miss @entity10 was not seen and @entity63 turned up only after the process was complete			1
there were so many possessions that the removal team made two runs			2
one onlooker said he had been told that some statues had been removed earlier in the day			0
‘ it looked very much like @entity10 is moving all of her personal possessions out of the house – and is n’t going to be back in a hurry , ’ he said			0
many items were apparently taken to a storage facility while the rest were taken to an address some seven miles away in south - west @entity22 where miss @entity10 appears to be setting up home			0
she was spotted yesterday with @entity107 , her 17 - year - old son from her first marriage , before heading back to the £ 10,000 - a - week @entity57 flat where she has been staying			0
a man was seen removing a box that had ' cookbooks ' written on it from @entity113 and @entity63 's house a @entity116 guitar is carefully packed into place among ms @entity10 's other possessions the 53 - year - old has been seen there several times looking drawn and without her wedding ring , and while her two children and sister have visited , there has been no sign of her husband of ten years			1

the advertising tycoon turned modern art mogul was photographed grabbing miss @entity10 by the throat and tweaking her nose outside @entity138 restaurant in central @entity22 during an extraordinary 27 - minute incident three sundays ago			0
when miss @entity10 left home after the photos were published a week later , @entity63 claimed he had simply suggested she moved out to wait for ‘ the dust to settle ’			1
moving out : miss @entity10 's keep - fit equipment is packed into the van , along with bags and some summer hats a plastic box full of personal effects is loaded , including , it appears , a can of @entity151 a worker removes a box which appears to contain the tv chef 's blender he initially tried to explain the throat - grabbing as a ‘ playful tiff ’			2
when further pictures of him twisting miss @entity10 ’s nose emerged , he said he had merely been trying to clean her nose			0
miss @entity10 ’s spokesman last night continued to refuse to comment either on the assault incident or on the state of her marriage			0
but moving her belongings to a different house would appear to signal the start of a divorce between the millionaire celebrity chef and @entity63 , who is said to have a fortune of up to £ 100million .			1
