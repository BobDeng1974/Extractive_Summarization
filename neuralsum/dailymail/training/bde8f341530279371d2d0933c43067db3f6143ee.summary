two @entity1 office workers expected , at the most , to have to call a plumber when their office toilet became clogged tuesday			1
instead , they had to call the county 's @entity4			0
@entity6 and @entity7 of @entity8 in @entity9 noticed the water level in the toilet of the second - floor restroom was higher than usual tuesday , according to the @entity13			2
and when @entity6 went to plunge it , the water level did n't go down			2
instead , a 5 1/2 foot snake came up			1
@entity6 screamed and ran from the bathroom , taping the door shut before she called animal services , @entity40 news reports			1
an animal services employee arrived to find a @entity20 rainbow boa curled up behind the toilet			1
the employee expects the snake had been in sewers for weeks , @entity46 reports , as it was underweight and shedding			0
@entity47 was a bit skeptical when @entity6 first told her of the slithering situation			0
' [ @entity6 ] said , ' it 's the size of my forearm , '' @entity47 told @entity46 , ' and i was like , ' no , it 's the probably the size of a pencil			0
' but when @entity47 cracked the door , she saw it for herself : a more than 5 - foot - long and 6 - inches - around boa			0
the animal services employee was even shocked , telling @entity46 the situation was ' the stuff of urban legends			2
' @entity62 deputy director @entity61 told @entity46 that when in the care of animal services , the snake got ' nippy ' and bit its handler			1
exaggerating : @entity6 ( left ) ran out of the stall , taped the door shut and told @entity7 ( right ) of her experience , but @entity47 thought her co-worker was exaggerating @entity71 : @entity47 took to @entity71 to describe the experience saying ' @entity73 to us ' pet : @entity6 said she wonders if the old pipes in the building , built in the 1800 's are to blame , @entity46 reports			0
but county animal services says the snake is most likely someone 's pet ( here , an animal services employee plays with the snake ) the agency took the snake to an animal center for examination , the @entity13 reports			1
if no one claims the snake by friday , the boa will be given to a rescue group			0
@entity6 said she wonders if the old pipes in the building , built in the 1800 's are to blame , @entity46 reports			0
but county animal services says the snake is most likely someone 's pet			2
where the snake came from and how it got into the toilet is still a mystery , as the @entity20 rainbow boa is native to @entity26 and northern regions of @entity28			1
it seems @entity6 and @entity47 were n't in much danger though			0
the @entity20 rainbow boa is said to be the most ' calm and good tempered ' of all the different species of rainbow boa .			1

@entity6 , of @entity1 , went to plunge her office toilet and a 5 1/2 foot snake came slithering up
animal services found a @entity20 rainbow boa curled up behind the sinl , shedding and underweight
how the snake got there and where it came from is a mystery , but authorities expect it had been in the sewer for days
