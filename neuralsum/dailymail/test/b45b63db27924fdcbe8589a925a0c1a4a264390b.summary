a family faces an anxious wait after being told all four of them could get leukaemia			1
@entity4 , 15 , was diagnosed last year with a one - in - a - million genetic condition which doctors say will eventually give her cancer if untreated			1
the rest of the family , from @entity10 , near @entity11 , are now waiting on tests which could reveal which of them also have a mutation of the @entity16 gene			1
the @entity16 gene is important in the production of blood cells , and the disorder means a sufferer 's blood count might be low , making them more vulnerable to infection			1
alternatively , the blood cells might be abnormal , leading to leukaemia			1
@entity4 , 15 , has a one - in - a - million genetic condition which doctors say will eventually give her cancer if untreated			1
the rest of her family ( her mother , @entity31 , father @entity32 and brother @entity33 are pictured ) are now waiting on tests which could reveal who else has the faulty gene miss @entity4 's mother @entity31 , who works as an artisan cake maker , said the rest of the family will find out their fate in the next few weeks			1
and despite the family fears , her daughter had taken the news as best she could			0
she said : ' getting a diagnosis like that , it 's a bit mixed			0
as a parent your feel like your insides have been ripped out , you 've got to be brave			0
' but there 's also relief that we know what 's wrong so she can deal with it			0
' she 's been absolutely amazing , we 've not had any tears , nothing , she 's ever so matter of fact about it , she understands all the consequences , they explained it all , and she 's been so mature			0
' she explained her daughter 's diagnosis came after years of illness			0
' she 's been getting ill for the last two or three years - she kept getting pneumonia and cellulitis ; any infection around she just seems to get			2
' baffled , doctors ran blood tests - which revealed she had a mutation of the @entity16 gene			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' the rest of us have had our fair share of problems , but no more than anybody else			2
' we 're just waiting for the tests to come back to see if we have the mutation			0
' miss @entity4 suffers from a mutation of the @entity16 gene			1
this is important in the production of blood cells , and the disorder means a sufferer 's blood counts might be low , making them more vulnerable to infection			1
or , the blood cells might be abnormal , leading to leukaemia doctors say the mutation 's frequency is less than one in a million - and one member of a family has a 50/50 per cent chance of passing it on she added that despite the bad news about the mutation , the family were grateful for the testing			1
' a few years ago we 'd have never found out until @entity4 got leukaemia , ' she said			1
' but now they but now they can predict it , which is amazing			0
she added : ' @entity113 willing , i want my son @entity33 to be ok			0
we 've already been told he 's not a bone marrow match , so @entity4 will need to go on the bone marrow register			2
' professor @entity119 , of @entity120 in @entity121 , is an expert in @entity4 's condition			2
he said : ' this mutation 's frequency is less than one in a million , it 's a very rare genetic disorder			2
' one member of a family has a 50/50 chance of passing it on , but it can also be the first time in the family that the genetic mutation occurs			2
' if we assume one of the parents has it , then there 's a significant possibility that her brothers and sisters have the defect , although they may not have symptoms			0
' he added : ' if they have the same defect , they ca n't be a bone marrow donor			0
' the donor has to be both tissue type compatible and also negative for the mutation , so it makes it more difficult to find a suitable donor			0

@entity4 , 15 , diagnosed with one - in - a - million genetic condition
has mutation of the @entity16 gene , making her vulnerable to infection
can also make blood cells abnormal , leading to leukaemia
the other members of her family will find out their fate in next few weeks
