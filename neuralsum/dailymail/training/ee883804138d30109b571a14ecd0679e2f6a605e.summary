a dad who said he repeatedly bounced his 10 - week - old baby on a blow - up mattress before squeezing the breath out of him in a ' bear hug ' , has been found guilty of first degree murder			1
@entity6 , 41 , showed no change of expression as he was convicted of killing his baby son @entity9 at their home in @entity12 , @entity13 , in january 2013			1
the father had originally claimed that he had crushed the baby when he tripped over his miniature dachshund , causing him to fall on the child			1
@entity6 's mother , @entity29 , who testified in his defense earlier in the day , wept in the audience as the verdict was read out , @entity28 reported			1
according to the paper , @entity34 prosecutor @entity33 said : ' we 're pleased , obviously , that @entity9 got the justice that he so deserved , and i look forward to his killer being sentenced for the rest of his life in prison			1
' in @entity13 , the mandatory sentence is life in prison without chance of parole for first - degree murder			1
earlier that day , @entity6 wept as his mother told the jury that her son was a kind man and a doting father who was good with small children			1
@entity6 wept as his mother told the jury that her son was a kind man and a doting father who was good with small children she explained that he was prone to be a ' people pleaser ' who will tell people what they want to hear when he 's under pressure			1
combined with her son 's learning disabilities - including attention deficit disorder and reading problems - ms @entity29 said this made him prone to tell people what they want to hear when he 's under pressure , even if it is a false confession			0
she said her son had been told he could not have biological children and was overjoyed when he learned his girlfriend , @entity72 , was pregnant with @entity9			1
ms @entity29 also said @entity6 and his ex-wife adopted twin special - needs children who were two when @entity9 died			1
@entity76 lives in a different state to her son and said she had not seen @entity6 after @entity9 was born			1
but she added that @entity6 constantly texted her photographs of @entity9 and his adopted children			1
@entity6 wiped his eyes repeatedly as his mother testified and sobbed openly at points			2
dr @entity82 , @entity34 medical examiner , also spoke yesterday morning , giving testimony for the prosecution about her examination and autopsy of @entity9 on january 5 , 2013 , the day after he died			2
she described extensive injuries , including a skull fracture , bleeding between the skull and the brain , and bruises on @entity9 's chin , chest and abdomen			2
some of the injuries partially healed , she said			0
dr @entity96 said the 25 bruises on the 10 - week - old 's body were the size of fingertips			0
she said @entity9 also had partially healed fractured ribs , a lacerated liver , bleeding inside his spleen and a bruised heart			0
@entity9 , aged just 10 - weeks , was killed by his father at their home in @entity12 , @entity13 she said that , given the examination and autopsy , her medical conclusion was that the baby 's death was a homicide caused by ' multiple injuries intentionally inflicted by another '			1
she said the injuries were not consistent with @entity6 's original story of accidentally falling on the baby and crushing him			2
the doctor said that even if the older , healing injuries were disregarded , the fatal head injury alone was not consistent with being crushed by another object			0
this is because bleeding inside the skull , she explained , caused by tearing of tiny blood vessels , is consistent only with a ' motion injury , ' with the baby striking another object while moving			0
@entity6 's mother , @entity29 , who testified in her son 's defense earlier in the day she also said the bruises on @entity9 's body were not consistent with a panicked , untrained person trying to revive a baby using cpr			1
@entity6 had claimed he was holding @entity9 in one arm and letting his dog in through a glass door , when the pet ran between his legs , tripping him and causing him to drop the baby on the carpet and then fall on top of him			1
former @entity12 @entity146 detective @entity145 testifies during the trial in court , the @entity12 fire chief , a police officer , a police sergeant and a paramedic all testified that @entity6 told them the same story about tripping and falling on the baby			1
the only difference between the stories was that , while he told most he dropped the 10 - week - old and then fell on him , the fire chief remembers @entity6 saying the two fell together			2
on wednesday , jurors watched and heard a video and audio recording of @entity6 's interview with detective @entity161			2
the interview just a few hours after @entity9 died			2
according to @entity28 , the jury heard persistent persuasion by @entity165 , who repeatedly insisted that the dog story was n't believable , suggesting that an exhausted @entity6 had ' snapped '			2
he initially said : ' i honestly ca n't remember what happened , ' adding ' nothing was done intentionally ' when @entity165 suggested he had shaken the baby			0
a few minutes later , @entity6 added : ' i need help			0
with my anger and my mood swings ... and i feel like i have a split personality , ' though still insisting the injuries were an ' accident '			0
@entity6 went on to say he ' bounced ' @entity9 seven or eight times on an inflated air mattress			2
later , as he was being handcuffed in preparation for being arrested and taken to jail , @entity6 said he had ' squeezed ' the 10 - week - old twice until @entity9 ' lost his breath , ' but with the baby resuming breathing both times			1
@entity72 , mother of 10 - week - old @entity184 , testifies during @entity6 's murder trial defendant @entity6 stands alongside his attorney @entity19 during his murder trial the defense team , led by @entity34 public defender @entity19 insisted that the dog story was true in their opening statement and that @entity6 told detectives he had shaken the baby so that he could return home to his fiancee			1
but , according to @entity28 , in his closing argument yesterday , mr @entity19 did not mention the dog story at all			0
@entity6 said he accidentally fell on his 10 - week - old son when his miniature dachshund tripped him instead , he appeared to be arguing for a compromise verdict - a conviction not of first - degree felony murder , but something less , such as manslaughter or second - degree murder			1
he focused on intent , noting that multiple witnesses testified @entity6 loved his children and was good with them			0
' the step was made over the line			0
... but it was n't intentional , ' @entity19 said			0
' what father intends to kill his child ? ' @entity9 's maternal grandmother , @entity213 , the defendant 's younger brother @entity76 and a day - care provider , @entity213 , all testified they saw nothing abnormal about @entity9 when they saw him days before his death			2
in his closing arguments , mr @entity19 acknowledged the damage done to the defense by a video of @entity6 's interview with a police detective in which he changed his story			1
' that was devastating for the defense , ' he			0
' you heard it , you saw it ... and then you heard the medical examiner this morning , and that too was devastating for the defense			0
i 'm not going to try to pull you away from that			0
' but mr @entity33 , prosecuting , insisted that this was not a manslaughter case ' you do n't get to kill your kid and say you lost it , he told the jury			0
this man intentionally inflicted these injuries on a defenseless 2 - month - old child , ' ' do n't compromise			0
find him guilty of felony murder			0
' the jury took just 45 minutes to decide on a verdict			0
sentencing is scheduled for october 27			0
