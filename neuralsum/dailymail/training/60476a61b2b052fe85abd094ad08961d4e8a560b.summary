by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 knows he 's no supermodel but he did n't think that would be an issue when he was being interviewed on tv as an author for his recently released book			1
so it came as a rude shock for the @entity11 - sider when he was turned down by a number of shows in @entity14 because he did n't have ' the @entity16 look '			2
the author of @entity18 of a @entity19 : true tales and gossip from the @entity22 was told by @entity24 producers that he needed to lose 45kg and further suggested that he sign up for reality weight - loss series @entity28			1
but the 38 - year - old was then told he could n't feature on the @entity24 version of the show as it would be difficult for the @entity24 audience to understand him as he does n't speak ' proper @entity35 '			1
@entity2 worked for @entity19 from 2001 to 2013			1
he is now the author of @entity18 of a @entity19 : true tales and gossip from the @entity22 mr @entity2 met @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) during his time as a first - class flight attendant for @entity19 @entity2 began his five - week international book tour in july for his tell all - memoir , which documents his 12 years attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class @entity19 flight attendant			1
he told @entity1 that he always knew he would write a book about his high - flying experiences			2
the 38 - year - old began writing the book in 2011 after he broke his back ' i wanted to keep note of the funny things because flight attending is n't your average job , ' he said			2
but it was n't until @entity2 became paralysed after breaking his back when he slipped down some stairs in 2011 that he put his plan into action			2
' those moments were dark for me as i was in hospital for two months and had to learn to walk again , ' he said			0
' so i wrote the book as a cathartic experience and it really helped			0
' while his road to recovery continues , @entity2 says his medication and physical restrictions has resulted in his 30kg weight gain			2
@entity2 , who already felt uncomfortable about his body , did n't think he would face scrutiny on his appearance whilst on a book tour			1
' my agent had sent over some tv reels to the @entity14 producers who then cancelled my interviews , ' he said			1
' i could n't understand why and then was told that the producers said that i should lose 100 pounds then come back			1
' it was so ridiculous because i was being held to the same standards as @entity81 and @entity82			0
' i thought as an author i would be judged on my intelligence and not for being a @entity87 's @entity86 model			0
' it really made me think that @entity14 really is the heartland of stupidity			0
' it was then suggested that he apply for @entity28 in the @entity24 ' but then when we looked into it i was told that i spoke too fast , my humour was too bitchy and that i do n't speak proper @entity35 so it would be hard for the @entity24 audience to understand what i 'm saying , ' he said			1
@entity2 says his tour was an eye - opener and taught him to be ' thick - skinned '			0
' i also think its important to make the point that men are equally scrutinised and criticised about their weight even if it is n't as openly discussed , ' he said			0
