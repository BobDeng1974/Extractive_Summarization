by @entity0 and @entity1 call - girl : @entity4 's daughter @entity3 , pictured , is locked in a furious fight with the stables of multi-millionaire @entity8 boss @entity7 even for a man who plays the stock market for a living , giving a racehorse to a high - class call - girl was always going to be a bit of a risk			1
and now the stables of multi-millionaire investment fund manager @entity7 are locked in a furious fight with aristocratic escort @entity3 over the fate of the once much - fancied @entity21			1
the horse , which belongs to mr @entity7 , was given to brunette @entity23 , 37 , on the understanding that she would hack out on him and show him off in the ring			1
she was also supplied with a full set of leather tack			0
mr @entity7 made a payment of £ 2,000 in february to @entity23 for @entity21 ’ upkeep			1
but to the dismay of the @entity8 titan , whose @entity36 is valued at £ 85 million by @entity38 , the £ 140 - an - hour prostitute has put the injury - prone @entity21 up for sale behind his back			1
the gelding has been entered into an equine auction at @entity44 on tuesday			0
she has put him up for sale as a wildcard ( or late ) entry			1
he is listed in the @entity50 at @entity51			0
now mr @entity7 ’s racing manager @entity52 is begging @entity23 to give the horse back			1
last week mr @entity52 emailed @entity23 – who is a gifted rider – saying : ‘ i am very sorry to see that the @entity21 has been given a wildcard entry into the @entity56 at @entity44 next week and wondered if there was anything we could do to help ? ‘ as you know , he was given to you so that you could show him in the ring and enjoy him on hacks , and we duly sent a full set of tack , including saddle , with him on the understanding that this was where his future lay			1
we are therefore slightly perturbed to see him in the @entity44 sale			2
injury - prone : the £ 140 - an - hour prostitue has put the once much - fancied @entity21 , pictured , up for sale ‘ would you be able to advise as to why you are now having to sell him ? could we look at taking him back off your hands and find him another suitable home ? ' our worry , of course , is his injury and the fact that he might well end up back in a racing yard , which would only cause him harm			1
we would like to prevent that if it were at all possible please			0
’ but @entity23 – the illegitimate eldest daughter of old etonian baronet sir @entity83 – is adamant @entity21 is hers to sell			1
‘ i am selling @entity21 because of a change of circumstances , ’ she told @entity85 from her home in a @entity88 village			1
‘ i ’m having a clean - out of stock and am getting some new horses in			2
’ successful : investment fund manager mr @entity7 ( left ) , 56 , is pictured with other owners at the races mr @entity7 denied knowing @entity96 , claiming she was a ‘ fantasist ’			1
he later confirmed he made a payment of £ 2,000 to her for the upkeep of the horse			2
@entity21 broke down in may 2012 , and was sent to the heart of @entity104 livery stable on february 7 this year			2
‘ he went with a new set of tack and on february 8 , i paid £ 2,000 to cover two years cost of stabling him			2
this is usual practice when placing retired , broken - down racehorses , ’ mr @entity7 said last night			1
@entity23 , who works as an escort under the pseudonym @entity113 , is believed to have stabled the horse at the @entity104 yard			2
the mother of two was exposed this year as a prostitute who encouraged wealthy clients to enjoy her services by trading on her aristocratic lineage			0
her estranged father is a clan chieftain with 45,000 acres of land along the banks of @entity124			0
wealthy : ms @entity3 's father owns 45,000 acres of land , including the @entity124 estate , pictured @entity23 , who was born to a girlfriend of the baronet before he was married , even posted a copy of the @entity3 family crest alongside intimate pictures of herself on her @entity136 page			0
she took to prostitution to bankroll a luxury lifestyle and was unashamed to have been unmasked in the media earlier this year , saying her work as an escort enabled her to keep two retired racehorses , four spaniels and to spend her time enjoying country pursuits			0
mr @entity7 , 56 , who lives with his wife @entity147 , 53 , and two sons in a £ 2.5 million house near @entity151 ’s exclusive @entity150 , likes to maintain a low profile despite his substantial fortune			1
he set up the @entity154 in 2001 from an office in @entity156 , @entity151 , and it has expanded to employ 112 people and manage £ 6.25 billion worth of assets			2
he sees horse racing as a relaxing hobby			0
‘ i have a high - pressure job and for the first five years after setting up @entity163 , i had very little time			0
for me , though , a day ’s racing is like a week ’s holiday , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m a pretty modest operator , i do n’t lead a wild life and i work bloody hard			0
but going racing is a collective thing – we all get our pleasures from it in our different ways			0
’ mr @entity7 bought @entity21 , his first horse , in 2010 for an estimated £ 250,000 from breeder @entity174			1
the seven - year - old gelding – a son of @entity178 winner @entity179 – has won £ 67,744 in prizemoney but has failed to fulfil its potential after straining a tendon			2
he is expected to fetch up to £ 10,000 at auction			0
mrs @entity174 is also distraught the horse is being sold , fearing his injury might see him sold for slaughter			0
she said : ‘ you would not know to look at him that he has had a serious injury			0
if you put a horse in the @entity44 sale , it ’s like the last - chance saloon			1
you have the meat men there			0

@entity196 was given once much - fancied @entity21
horse belongs to @entity8 titan @entity7 , who is worth an estimated £ *85m*
the £ 140 - an - hour prostitute has now put horse up for sale behind his back
