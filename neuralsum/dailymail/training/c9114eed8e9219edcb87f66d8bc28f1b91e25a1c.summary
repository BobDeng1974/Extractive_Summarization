by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's government continues to languish behind the @entity4 , with the latest @entity5 showing the public would turf the government out in a landslide if an election was held today			1
the @entity5 , published in today 's @entity10 , shows that despite a tiny one per cent gain in the @entity13 's primary vote in the last fortnight , @entity3 's government remains deeply unpopular with the electorate			1
the government 's fortunes took a turn for the worst with the release of the may 13 budget , which included cuts to welfare spending , schools and hospitals			2
when elected in september , the @entity13 's primary vote was 45.6 per cent , but now it has fallen to just 36 per cent			2
@entity4 's primary vote in the september election was just 33.3 per cent , but has now risen under opposition leader @entity28 to 12.3 per cent			2
but surveys carried out from may 16 right up until sunday , show a swing in the opposite direction			0
in the two - party preferred poll , support for the @entity42 has dropped down to 46 per cent while @entity4 is favoured by 54 per cent of voters , as of july 13			1
@entity5 also shows voters continue to prefer @entity28 over @entity3 as prime minister			1
a survey asking readers to determine the better prime minister out of the two parties leaders , also shows that the majority choose @entity28 over @entity3 by 5 per cent the @entity5 findings come as phone polling carried out across the country revealed the unpopularity of the government 's higher education cuts , according to the @entity58			1
the survey found 69 per cent of those surveyed opposed increases in university fees while 65 per cent disagreed with the @entity63 's 20 per cent public funding cut to university courses			1
higher education cuts top the list of policies that voters are most unhappy about , according to the @entity58 which found that 69 per cent of those surveyed oppose the increases in university fees the survey also found 46 per cent were opposed to government funding for privately - owned universities , with only 28 per cent in support			1
the voter 's dislike at the proposed cuts can also be clearly seen in the drop in support for federal education minister @entity80 , according to the @entity58			2
mr @entity80 's support has fallen by 13 per cent since last september 's election , putting him at risk of losing his seat of @entity85 in @entity87 â€™s eastern suburbs			0
meanwhile , the @entity5 also found the majority of voters wanted the carbon tax scrapped			0
the poll found 53 per cent of voters want the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) to support the repeal bills , while 35 per cent want the party to vote against them			1
the latest survey was conducted after the proposal to axe the controversial carbon tax was blocked by @entity92 senators on thursday			0
the federal government has since been in talks with @entity92 staff to discuss further changes to the bills , ahead of it going back to the lower house on monday			0
mr @entity3 has said he is still committed to abolishing the tax			0
the newspoll of 1207 voters taken on friday , saturday and sunday also shows 85 per cent of coalition supporters want the carbon tax scrapped immediately , while eight per cent want it to remain and seven per cent are undecided			0
about 30 per cent of @entity4 supporters also want the tax 's imminent removal , though the majority , 53 per cent , want @entity92 to block the bills .			0

the latest @entity5 shows support for @entity3 at lowest level since 2009
@entity4 has a 54 per cent to 46 per cent lead over the @entity13 and would win an election *comfortably* if one was held now
support for the @entity3 - led government has *plummeted* since the release of the federal budget which many think is *unfair*
another poll found that 69 per cent of @entity31 did not support proposed increases in university fees
