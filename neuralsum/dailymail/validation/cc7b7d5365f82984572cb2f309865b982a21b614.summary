killer on the loose : @entity0 and his wife @entity3 from @entity4 were murdered in @entity5 in 2012 detectives investigating the murders of four people including members of a @entity12 family in the @entity13 have ruled out a mystery biker seen close to the scene , it emerged today			1
it was on september 5 , 2012 that @entity4 engineer @entity0 , 50 , and his wife , @entity3 , 47 , died alongside her mother and a @entity13 cyclist			1
the @entity21 ' daughters , @entity22 , seven at the time , and @entity24 , four , survived the savage attack close to @entity26 , in eastern @entity5			1
the motorcyclist wearing a highly distinctive helmet was spotted nearby , and many felt certain that he would unlock the mystery of what really happened			2
but now it has emerged that he was ‘ positively identified ’ last month , and has now been ‘ ruled out as the murderer ’			2
a legal source close to police in @entity37 , who interviewed the unidentified man , said : ‘ he was seen on a nearby road within minutes of the murders , but it took many months to track him down			1
’ the man is from @entity44 , eastern @entity5 , and was paragliding in the @entity13 during particular warm weather			1
‘ he is no longer considered suspicious , but may be re-interviewed over what he may have seen around the area , ’ said the source			0
it was in 2013 that the police finally issued a photo - fit image of the motorcyclist , and this is thought to have helped identify him			1
the latest development is a huge setback for @entity58 , the prosecutor leading the enquiry , who has already admitted that those responsible may never be caught			0
conceding that the enquiry could go on for years to come , mr @entity58 said last year : ‘ we have tried everything possible , but perhaps we ’re in the presence of the perfect crime			0
’ murders : the @entity67 died alongside mrs @entity69 's mother and a @entity13 cyclist , while their two young daughters survived the savage attack close to @entity26 , in eastern @entity5 mrs @entity69 died next to her mother , @entity75 , 74 , while local cyclist @entity76 , 45 , was killed by a hail of bullets before being dragged along the ground and crushed by a car			1
not a suspect : a forensic drawing shows the motorcyclist who has now been ruled out there have been claims that mr @entity69 was involved in a dispute over a family inheritance with his brother @entity88 , 54 , of @entity89 , @entity4			1
@entity88 was arrested in 2013 under suspicion of conspiracy to murder but then released because he has a watertight alibi			0
@entity93 , a 49 - year - old old former policeman from the @entity26 area , also spent four days in custody over the killings in february			2
the gun collector is still being investigated for arms trafficking , but there has been no legal action linked to the four murders			2
there are also well sourced claims that cyclist mr @entity76 may have been the intended victim due			0
he was linked to a multi-million pounds fortune through his relationship with an heiress			0
@entity22 and @entity24 , the surviving daughters , are now in the care of members of the @entity67 ' extended family			0
they have been given round - the - clock security because those responsible for the murders are still at large .			0

@entity13 police has ruled out a suspect in the 2012 @entity69 murders
@entity0 , 50 , his wife , @entity3 , 47 , her mother and a cyclist were killed
