the 29 - year - old heads into the @entity8 @entity7 at @entity9 this weekend with a slender three - point lead over @entity14 team - mate and title rival @entity11			1
it is the closest @entity0 has come to adding to his 2008 drivers ' championship crown , which he won at @entity18 in his second season in @entity5			1
championship leader @entity0 poses with a fan ahead of this weekend 's @entity8 @entity7 @entity0 , three points ahead of title rival @entity11 , speaks to the assembled press ahead of sunday 's race a perceived gung - ho style has sometimes yielded great results or silly mistakes from the championship leader , but he believes he has moved away from relying solely on his instinct and now understands what is needed to repeat his success of six years ago			1
' i 'm older , and i feel it ! , ' he replied when asked what the major differences were between then and now			2
' back then it was all instinct , i think my maturity was at a very early stage and i probably think that is the biggest change and hopefully i will keep getting more and more mature			2
' also my work ethic			2
my work ethic is a lot better , more serious and more understanding - it seems to be working well for me			2
the @entity45 driver holds an umbrella in the paddock to shield himself from the rain on thursday ' this has been the most consistent and best - performing season i have had in @entity5 and i want to continue that for many , many years - it is like building blocks , i just need to keep working on it			1
' you do n't focus on the past but you do n't forget about it			0
ultimately what has happened in the past has defined today - it has shaped me personally , mentally and psychically into who i am today			0
' particularly this year , those experiences i have had i know this weekend will be a tough weekend , the next five could all be tough weekends , there is all the possibilities in the world i could be facing the toughest time of my life - but it is also possible it could be the greatest time of my life			2
' victory in @entity72 a fortnight ago , coupled with the retirement of @entity11 , saw @entity0 nudge back ahead in their back - and - forth fight for the title			1
@entity0 leads the pack into the first corner at the @entity78			1
he went on to claim victory but @entity0 does not expect the @entity80 to be dwelling on his disappointment and has backed him to come out fighting in @entity9			1
' @entity11 is such a strong competitor , ' he said			1
' always , since we were young kids , he has been so strong mentality and confident and sure of his abilities			0
' he has shown time and time again his pace and speed but he has also shown how he overcomes things quickly			0
' he handled the last race with dignity , it felt that he had moved on very quickly and i anticipate he will be coming here stronger than ever and i need to be ready for that			0
' @entity11 used the old adage that time is a great healer as he looks to regain the advantage in the title run - in			1
@entity11 , who has n't won since july 's @entity80 @entity7 , pictured with his mechanics on thursday evening ' it is one of those moments and time is the best cure for such things , ' he said of his @entity72 retirement			1
' it 's been two weeks , which is plenty of time in the racing world			2
i 'm here , i 'm just as excited and optimistic as i was in @entity72			2
i 've never come to @entity9 before in the most dominant car , so that 's a great feeling			0
' @entity11 has now been forced to retire from two races this season , with @entity0 suffering the same fate on three occasions - but both have also been forced to nurse problems to the end of some grands prix			1
but , with @entity0 calling for improved reliability to give the drivers a ' straight battle ' at the championship , @entity11 insists he is not losing any sleep over technical issues			1
' i 'm not worrying about reliability , ' he said			0
' i have this inner trust that the team is going to get the job done			0
' i 'm not concerned , even though it is a little weakness for us , in the big picture we have done an awesome job this year , so we must n't now see this as a big problem for us as a team			0
it 's a problem we have , but the big picture is absolutely spectacular			0
' there remains a possibility sunday 's race may yet be cancelled if the approaching @entity142 passes close enough to @entity9			0
in all likelihood any race that goes ahead will be affected by the rain and , although that would add another variable into the title mix , @entity11 is hoping for a wet race			1
' the more rain the better - our car is so fast in the rain , ' he added			0
' i had pole at @entity154 the last time out when it was raining			0
