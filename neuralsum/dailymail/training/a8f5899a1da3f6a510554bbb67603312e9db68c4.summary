not good : director of national intelligence @entity0 warned that the leak of top secret documents proving government oversight over personal records could cause serious national security issues the top @entity8 intelligence official denounced the disclosure of highly secret documents thursday and sought to set the record straight about how the government collects intelligence about people 's telephone and internet use			1
he said he was declassifying some aspects of the monitoring to help @entity8 understand it better			0
director of national intelligence @entity0 called the disclosure of an internet surveillance program ' reprehensible ' and said it risks @entity8 ' security			0
he said a leak that revealed a program to collect phone records would affect how @entity8 's enemies behave and make it harder to understand their intentions			1
' the unauthorized disclosure of a top secret @entity8 court document threatens potentially long - lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation , ' @entity0 said in an unusual late - night statement			2
at the same time , he moved to correct misunderstandings about both programs , taking the rare step of declassifying some details about the authority used in the phone records program and alleging that articles about the internet program ' contain numerous inaccuracies			1
' he did not specify what those inaccuracies might be			0
at issue is a court order , first disclosed wednesday by @entity51 newspaper in @entity52 , that requires the communications company @entity53 to turn over on an ' ongoing , daily basis ' the records of its customers ' calls			1
separately , the @entity59 and @entity51 reported thursday the existence of another program used by the @entity62 and @entity63 that scours the nation 's main @entity65 companies , extracting audio , video , emails and other information			2
spying : the @entity62 has been getting millions of phone records from @entity53 on a daily basis for months without any justification for the order , that was only revealed today ' the unauthorized disclosure of a top secret @entity8 court document threatens potentially long - lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation , ' @entity0 said thursday @entity0 said the @entity65 program , known as @entity84 , ca n't be used to intentionally target any @entity8 or anyone in the @entity8 he said a special court , @entity87 and the executive branch all oversee the program and that extensive procedures make sure the acquisition , retention and dissemination of data accidentally collected about @entity8 is kept to a minimum			1
he added that @entity87 recently reauthorized the section of the @entity97 that authorizes such a program			0
' information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect , and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats , ' @entity0 said			0
@entity0 acknowledged the risks inherent in publicly discussing details about the phone records program but said he wanted to correct the ' misleading impression ' created by the article that disclosed its existence			1
double bind : part of the order mandated that @entity53 not tell its ' customer 's about the record transfer nor could they admit that the order existed ' i believe it is important for the @entity8 people to understand the limits of this targeted counterterrorism program and the principles that govern its use			1
' to that end , @entity0 said he was immediately declassifying and releasing to the public certain details about the @entity97 provision that governs the program			0
a special panel known as the @entity131 authorizes the phone records program and reviews it about every 90 days , @entity0 said , adding that the @entity133 oversees information acquired under the court order and that members of @entity87 have been fully and repeatedly briefed			1
he said only a small fraction of the records collected ever get examined because most are unrelated to any inquiries into terrorism activities			0
the @entity62 collects the phone data in broad swaths , @entity0 said , because collecting it a narrow fashion would make it harder to identify terrorism - related communications			1
wide - reaching : millions of @entity53 customers had their data turned over to the @entity62 , and it is not known whether similar orders were given to other phone companies as well lashing out : former vice president @entity150 called the surveillance ' outrageous ' , not supporting his fellow democrats timing : the revelation comes the same day as president @entity154 announced his appointment of @entity156 ( right ) to be the new head of the @entity62 , replacing @entity158 ( center ) he said the information collected lets the government , over time , make connections about terrorist activities			1
he said the program does n't let the @entity8 listen to people 's calls , but only includes information like call length and telephone numbers dialed			2
the court also prohibits the government from indiscriminately rummaging through the phone data , which he said can only be queried when there are specific facts to back up a reasonable suspicion of an association with a foreign terrorist group			1
he says officials allowed to access the records must be specially cleared and are trained in the court - approved procedures			2
@entity0 also cited the @entity183 and noted both the @entity154 and @entity185 administrations had reauthorized the provision used to grant authority to the program			0
that provision deals with the ability to compel an entity to hand over business records			2
warning : senators @entity192 ( left ) and @entity193 ( right ) wrote a letter warning the attorney general that there would be public outcry should the government 's actions become public when the first revelation in the case came out wednesday night about the order against @entity53 , @entity201 put out an immediate statement calling for an end to the program - which is scheduled to run until july 19 - and a investigation into the order			1
' from a civil liberties perspective , the program could hardly be any more alarming , ' @entity211 deputy legal director @entity210 said in a statement			0
' it â€™s a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents			0
' it is beyond @entity221 , and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies			0
' the order is the first concrete evidence that @entity8 intelligence officials are continuing a broad campaign of domestic surveillance that began under president @entity185 and caused great controversy when it was first exposed			0
in 2005 , the @entity235 reported that the @entity62 was wiretapping @entity8 without warrants on international calls			2
@entity238 and @entity239 later reported that the agency also had unchecked access to records on domestic calls			2
in addition , a former @entity245 technician , @entity244 , said that a room accessible only with @entity62 clearance in the carrier 's main @entity250 hub received perfect copies of all transmissions			0
@entity53 is the second biggest @entity8 telephone company behind @entity245 in terms of revenue			0
the vast majority of @entity53 's overseas operations come from its acquisition of @entity259 , which is also covered by the order although foreign - to - foreign calls are exempted from it .			1

a copy of a secret order shows that the @entity62 ordered @entity53 to hand over millions of phone records with no explanation
order extends from until july 19 and includes domestic and foreign calls
nearly *150million* @entity53 customers could be affected by the court order
even more had their email and social *networking* accounts recorded
comes just after news of the @entity133 spying on *journalists*
