a photographer was left ' all shook up ' after spotting the face of @entity2 on the back of a bug			1

the unusual stink bug bears an uncanny resemblance to the @entity28			1
@entity15 was on a photographic assignment with @entity30 in the @entity31 in southern @entity24 , when she came across the unusual creature sitting on a leaf			1
she said : ' the instant i saw it , i did a double - take			2
i immediately thought of @entity2 with his pompadour hairdo and quickly pulled out my camera			0
' thank goodness it did n't fly away			0
' i later found out that ' @entity2 ' was a giant shield bug , related to the stink bug family			2
' it is found in @entity44 and i would guess it 's uncommon since so many people had n't seen it before			0
' i was in the area for about three weeks , but sadly did n't encounter @entity2 in the woods again			0
' the bug has previously been spotted in the forests of @entity52 , where it was likened to the @entity55 character @entity54			1
there , it was captured by @entity58 , an amateur photographer who lives in the country			0
after passing hundreds of other insects in the forest , this bug caught mr @entity58 's eye due to its ' stunning colour and intricate camouflage '			2
spotting the insect he quickly picked up his camera to get up close - and discovered the face of the tv character branded across its back			1
@entity58 , 32 , said : ' i was simply in awe at the beauty of the camouflage - i know many insects use it to avoid being preyed upon but i 'd never seen anything like it before			2
' i was just captivated by the bright colours			0
' then on closer inspection it just hit me there is actually a face on its back			0
usually found in @entity44 , the @entity18 bug is also known as a giant shield bug			2
shield bugs have glands in their thorax between the first and second pair of legs which produce a foul smelling liquid to deter predators			0
@entity58 , a banker from @entity52 , first picked up a camera in 2009 and specialises in macro photography - a unique skill revealing details hidden in normal photography			1
he was visiting the forests specifically to shoot insects on a macro photography trip			0
he added : ' it was about midday , i chanced upon this stink bug and fortunately it was actually quite co-operative so i managed to take a number of shots at different angles			2
' i 'd had a few insects scurry away earlier that day - but there was no way this one was getting away			0
' ' after i shot this bug i did some research when i got home and found out there are so many more variations of this species			0
' i 'm still hoping i will be able to capture more variations of it			0
' @entity55 's @entity54 has entertained millions of children during his time on the show and has a fondness for number six and the tuba			1
