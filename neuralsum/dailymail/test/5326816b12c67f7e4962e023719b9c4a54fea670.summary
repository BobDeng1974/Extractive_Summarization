there will have been eight @entity3 derbies by the end of this season , no city showdown has been played more in recent years			1
@entity6 looks at the reasons why @entity3 ’s meeting with @entity9 can also lay claim to be the greatest city derby in world football			1
opposites attract the clash of styles is always fascinating			0
@entity16 must accommodate @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 and that leaves him little choice but to play a 4 - 3 - 3			1
@entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 must all be accommodated , leaving little choice but 4 - 3 - 3 @entity9 and @entity3 are meeting for the fifth and sixth time in @entity24 competition that brings them level with @entity27 and @entity28 in number of city duels			1
@entity31 and @entity32 have met twice , as have @entity33 and @entity34 and @entity35 and @entity36			0
it ’s a system that leaves @entity9 short in midfield especially when you consider none of the first choice midfield trio are defensive players			1
this plays perfectly into @entity3 ’s hands			1
@entity45 will flood the midfield on tuesday night as he has done in recent meetings between the two sides and see if his 4 - 4 - 2 with @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 ca n’t over-run @entity52 , @entity53 in midfield			2
@entity3 ’s two banks of four are also very good at closing the space down for @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity19			1
no wonder @entity16 said on monday that playing @entity45 ’s team is always a problem			0
midfielder @entity51 will be deployed to try and smother the @entity9 midfield during their last eight tie the coaches @entity45 never tires of his ‘ one game at a time mantra ’ @entity16 was on monday talking about the challenge being not to beat @entity3 but to win the 11th @entity65 – the complete opposite of one game at a time			1
this meeting has added spice because it 's the chance for last season 's beaten finalists to avenge their victors			0
@entity74 had the same opportunity against @entity76 in 1978 as did @entity77 against @entity78 in 1997 and @entity27 against @entity79 in 2011			2
@entity45 ’s burns more calories on the touchline than some of his players while @entity16 ’s activity tends to get no more anaerobic than opening another packet of chewing gum			0
the @entity88 has won the lot in club football , @entity45 is on his way to equaling that feat – he has already won the league and cup in @entity95 , and the @entity24 and @entity95 @entity96 along with the @entity97			2
he almost got the @entity65 last year but @entity16 denied him			0
for as long as the pair stay in @entity95 their futures will be linked			0
@entity45 raises his players one game at a time and the games against @entity9 are no difference @entity9 boss @entity16 and @entity3 boss @entity45 often have their careers compared the @entity9 stars against the team with no stars when @entity9 were beaten 4 - 0 by @entity3 in the league in february it was n’t the @entity3 players who went out partying			1
@entity9 ’s players are the footballing glitterati and @entity17 ’s high - profile birthday bash was part of that			1
@entity3 ’s players take great joy in beating their pin - up rivals			2
@entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 are happy to play it ugly if it gets results			0
@entity122 and @entity121 are happy to play ugly to achieve winning results for their side goals and golazos @entity51 ’s thunderbolt shots , the inspiration of @entity48 , a moment ’s magic from @entity135 – @entity3 are about more than just graft			2
and with @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity52 and @entity137 all capable of moments of brilliance the derbies have thrown up their fair share of great goals			1
@entity17 and @entity18 's moments of brilliance have thrown up their fair share of goals in the game @entity3 's @entity147 midfielder @entity48 has scored his fair share of wondergoals in his career well - matched they used to hold a sarcastic banner up behind the goal at the @entity154 for the @entity3 derby			1
it was written like a classified ad and read : ‘ wanted – decent rival for city derby ’			0
those days are long gone			0
@entity3 ended a 14 - year run of not beating @entity9 when they won the @entity161 against them two years ago			1
@entity163 celebrates a goal against his rivals in the @entity65 final in @entity167 the game is a chance for @entity45 to get his own back on @entity16 for the defeat in what is to date their only meeting in @entity24 competition			2
although some would say with four wins and two draws in the six games in other competitions between the two since then , he has already done that			0
and they have n’t looked back since			0
at the start of the season they beat them in the @entity186 and knocked them out of the @entity161 both times over two legs			0
the one blip in the recent run came when it mattered most in last year ’s @entity65 final and they will hope to put that right on tuesday night			0
most @entity197 derbies have one side up and the other down – right now @entity3 as @entity95 champions and @entity9 as @entity24 champions are a match for each other in every sense			1
@entity18 celebrates when it counts most as he scores in the @entity65 final in @entity167 in 2014			2

@entity9 and @entity3 meet for the fifth and sixth time in @entity24
that brings them level with @entity27 and @entity28 in number of city duels
there will have been eight @entity3 derbies by the end of this season
no city showdown has been played more time in recent years
