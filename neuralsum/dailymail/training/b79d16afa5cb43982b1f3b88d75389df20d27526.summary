@entity0 experienced a sudden , excruciating pain in his back tending to his much - loved garden one winter 's morning , @entity0 experienced a sudden , excruciating pain in his back , which left his legs feeling dead			1
the pain came on suddenly and , initially , @entity0 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , thought one of the deer that roam the remote area had kicked him			1
' it was like nothing i 'd ever felt before , ' says @entity0 , 69 , a retired hairdresser			1
' i noticed i had no sensation from my lower back to my knees			1
when i realised it was n't an animal , i thought it might be severe cramp , as i 'd been working outside for four hours , mostly on my knees			2
' i crawled 100 yards to our back door			1
i then pulled myself half up , but still had no feeling in the top half of my legs			2
my wife , @entity27 , had to help me to sit down			2
' although my feet and ankles worked , i had no control over my lower legs			2
i also had a burning sensation around my buttocks and down most of my legs			2
' what @entity0 had suffered that day in january 2012 was a stroke , not to his brain , as usually happens , but his spine			1
normally , a stroke is caused either by a blockage to the blood supply to the brain , or a bleed from a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain			1
with a spinal stroke , the same principles apply , but the blockage or bleed affects the spinal cord			1
stretching from the base of the brain to the small of the back , the spinal cord is a key part of the body 's central nervous system , which transmits instructions from the brain to the rest of the body			1
like the brain , the cord needs a constant blood supply to provide oxygen and nutrients			0
if it is halted , the nerves quickly become damaged and some die			0
as a result , these stop sending messages from the brain to the muscles - which muscles this affects depends on where the stroke occurs			1
but a stroke around the neck section of the spinal cord could affect the muscles in the arms			1
the most common cause of spinal strokes , as with brain strokes , is a build - up of cholesterol plaque in an artery wall , which then blocks it			0
alternatively , small vessels supplying the spine rupture , due to abnormalities of the vessel walls or malformations of the vessels , says @entity106 , professor of stroke medicine at @entity109 's @entity108			1
some patients have a spinal stroke during surgery , for example , while treating an aneurysm , a bulge in a blood vessel , especially if it 's in the aorta in the abdomen			1
a stent , or hollow tube , is usually inserted into the aorta to strengthen its wall			0
this temporarily blocks blood flow to the spine , so the risk of a spinal stroke increases			1
what @entity0 had suffered that day in january 2012 was a stroke in his spine ' obesity or smoking are also causes , as fatty deposits make arteries narrow and raise blood pressure , putting strain on the body , ' says professor @entity106			1
' normally , there is no warning : only in rare cases do patients experience a slight weakness in their legs briefly beforehand			0
' of the 152,000 strokes in the @entity147 each year , spinal strokes make up about 1.25 per cent , says the @entity148			0
for some , ' a spinal stroke can prove fatal towards the neck , as it can have a devastating impact on nerves to muscles , which control breathing and the diaphragm ' , says professor @entity106			1
most spinal stroke victims will survive , but are often left with life - long disabilities			1
' unfortunately , the prognosis for spinal stroke patients is not great , ' says professor @entity106			2
while other parts of the brain are able to take over other functions in brain stroke patients , once the wires are cut in the spinal cord , there 's no route for sensory messages			2
treatments include reducing the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid , a clear liquid found in the cavities around the brain and spinal cord			0
following spinal stroke , this can build up around where it struck			2
draining some , via a lumbar puncture in the lower back , can reduce pressure , improving blood flow			2
' otherwise , the only treatment is rehabilitation through physiotherapy and exercise , ' says professor @entity106			0
@entity186 , director of services at spinal injury charity aspire , says spinal strokes bring different problems in different patients			0
' most people think of not being able to walk , but there can be loss of bladder and bowel function due to nerve damage , or skin issues including pressure sores , as they have lost their sense of touch			2
' most people can not sweat below the level of their injury , so are more likely to overheat			0
they also face circulation issues and so are more likely to feel the cold			0
there can be pain issues , too			2
' it can lead to fatal complications if the patient is left paralysed			0
' being more immobile puts patients at risk of pneumonia , caused by an infection in the lungs , and bladder infections			0
if they 're lying for long periods , bed sores that become infected and lead to septicaemia - potentially fatal blood poisoning - become a concern , ' says professor @entity106			0
@entity0 had no idea of such risks when he suffered his spinal stroke : he thought he 'd suffered a minor back injury , and even had lunch afterwards , although the ' deadness ' in his legs and burning sensation remained			1
@entity0 still struggles to walk , as he is so unsteady later that afternoon , he called @entity231 , who recommended going to @entity233			1
he underwent various examinations , but , initially , the cause was unclear			0
spinal stroke can be hard to detect , and common causes of numbness in the legs are often explored first			2
as the numbness in @entity0 's legs meant he 'd lost control of his bowels and bladder , he stayed in hospital for further tests			1
a week later , possible causes such as a slipped disc , trapped nerve , severe inflammation , or a tumour had been ruled out			0
because of continued weakness in his legs , he had an mri scan of his spine , and spinal stroke was diagnosed			1
' i 'd never heard of it , but was relieved this stroke allowed me to function and talk , ' says @entity0 , who , despite being a light social drinker and smoker , had been fit and active			1
he remained in hospital for two weeks , where full feeling to his left leg and his ability to control going to the toilet returned			0
he learned to walk again using a @entity268 frame , before using a walking stick for a few months , while undergoing rehabilitation and physiotherapy			2
@entity0 now takes daily medicines , including blood - thinning pills and cholesterol - lowering statins , to ward off stroke , and gabapentin , for long - term nerve damage , to dampen the burning sensation in his right leg			1
' if i forget to take it , it 's like i 'm standing next to our @entity283 cooker , ' he says			0
' my right leg still feels dead above the knee			0
i can stick a pin in it and do n't feel anything			0
but , if our cat 's tail lightly touches my bare leg , it 's like an electric shock			0
the nerves are so damaged , they act in an unusual way - the lighter the touch , the greater the sensation , it seems			0
' @entity0 still struggles to walk , as he is so unsteady			1
he can no longer carry anything when moving			1
he continues to be a keen gardener , but uses a ride - on mower			0
he ca n't bend down easily , so he lies on the ground for less arduous tasks			0
' my consultant said if feeling did n't return within 18 months , it never would			0
so , i 've accepted i 'll always walk with my leg dragging behind me , ' says @entity0			1
' but i have n't let it stop me , and it has made me appreciate more what i can achieve in the garden			0
