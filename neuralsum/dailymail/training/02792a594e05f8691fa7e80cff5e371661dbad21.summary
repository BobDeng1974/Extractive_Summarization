by @entity0 @entity1 is recalling more than 29,000 @entity3 compact cars because metal parts in the air bag assemblies can hit the driver and passengers if the bags are inflated			1
it is the latest of a series of recalls that have heaped humiliation on the 106 - year - old car manufacturer and brings the number of models called back this year to 45 - totaling more than 20 million faulty cars worldwide			1
the cars , from the 2013 and 2014 model years , were built with an incorrect baffle , and that can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed , the @entity17 said			1
if that happens , metal fragments could hit people in the car , and the air bags may not inflate to protect them			2
baffling : the @entity29 were built with an incorrect baffle , and that can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed the air bags were built by @entity37 parts supplier @entity36 , but the problem is different from another air bag issue that 's causing big recalls across the auto industry , the safety agency said thursday			1
@entity1 had ordered dealers to stop selling new @entity43 on wednesday			2
spokesman @entity44 said the order for most cars was lifted later in the day when @entity1 determined which cars were affected			2
dangerous : an incorrect baffle can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed , the @entity17 say the @entity3 , built in @entity51 , @entity52 , is @entity1 's top - selling car			1
@entity1 found out about the problem on may 1 , when a driver filed a lawsuit naming the company , according to documents filed with @entity17			0
the lawsuit alleged that an air bag in a 2013 @entity3 deployed improperly and injured the driver			1
@entity1 has recalled more than 20 million cars worldwide this year alone for a variety of faults			1
they include the following : february 7 2014 - @entity1 recalls about 800,000 @entity66 and @entity66 vehicles due to faulty ignition switches			1
february 24 - @entity1 adds 600,000 @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 vehicles to the recall			2
march 28 - @entity1 expands its ignition switch recall , adding 824,000 cars sold in the @entity76 between 2008 and 2011 to the list			1
the switch recall alone covers 2.6 million cars sold worldwide			2
march 28 - @entity1 confirmed that one more death had been caused by the ignition switch problem , raising the total to 13			2
april 10 - @entity1 finds another flaw in the ignitions of the 2.6 million vehicles it has already recalled			1
may 15 - @entity1 recalls 3 million more cars - most of which were built before the automaker ’s 2009 bankruptcy - due to a wiring problem			1
may 16 - @entity1 agrees to pay a $ 35 million fine to settle a federal investigation into why its ignition switch recall took ten years to deploy			2
may 20 - @entity1 recalls another 2.4 million vehicles , including late model editions of the @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , for faulty seatbelts and transmissions			1
may 21 - @entity1 recalls 218,000 @entity99 amid claims of overheating and fires			2

june 13 - @entity1 recalls 512,000 cars , most of which are @entity109 that can be accidently shut off while driving if the key is carrying too much weight			1
june 16 - @entity1 recalls about 3.4 million cars for the same reason			1
company engineers inspected the air bag and contacted @entity36			1
@entity1 told @entity17 about the problem on may 27			0
@entity1 sent @entity3 air bags to @entity36 , and the company figured out what was wrong on june 20			1
@entity1 decided to recall the cars on june 23 , according to the document			2
it comes weeks after @entity1 was fined $ 35 million by @entity17 for its slow response to the small - car ignition switch problem			2
earlier this month , the firm urged drivers to remove key chains from their car keys after it admitted it needed to change or replace the keys for about 3.4 million cars because they could cause the ignition switch to move out of position if they are carrying too much weight			0
@entity1 said that the switches can rotate out of ' run ' if the key has excess weight and the car ' experiences some jarring event ' , such as hitting a pothole or crossing a railroad track			0
that can shut off the engines and disable power steering , causing drivers to lose control			0
also , the air bags wo n't work			0
the recall affects seven cars with model years ranging from 2000 to 2014			0
that recall covered the 2005 - 2009 @entity152 ; 2006 - 2014 @entity153 ; 2000 to 2005 @entity154 ; 2004 - 2011 @entity155 ; the 2006 - 2011 @entity156 ; the 2004 and 2005 @entity157 and @entity158 ; and the @entity159 from the 2006 through 2008 model years			0
@entity1 is already recalling 2.6 million older small cars , mostly in the @entity76 , for a similar problem where the ignition switch slips out of ' run ' and causes an engine stall			1
the $ 35 million fine came after lawmakers expressed disbelief at @entity1 ' explanation for why it took 11 years to recall millions of small cars with defective ignition switches , and also confronted its chief executive with evidence that the company dragged its feet on a similar safety issue in different vehicles			1
ceo @entity179 and attorney @entity180 , who recently released a 315 - page investigative report into the recall , endured skepticism and some lecturing at a @entity186 subcommittee hearing			0
one member referred to the actions of some employees described in the report as ' insane			0
' the @entity1 recall has triggered a deeper look at ignition switches across the auto industry			0
the government has opened an investigation into reports of defective switches in 1.2 million @entity199 vehicles			0
@entity179 made her second appearance before the committee since @entity1 recalled 2.6 million small cars in february			1
as families of some of the people who died in crashes in @entity207 and @entity208 looked on , she was again pressed on whether @entity1 's commitment to safety has changed much			0
' insane ' : @entity1 ceo @entity179 endured skepticism and some lecturing at a @entity186 subcommittee hearing where she was asked to explain why the firm has encountered so many problems			0
one member referred to the actions of some employees described in the report as ' insane			0
' rep. @entity220 , @entity221 , read a 2005 e-mail from a @entity1 employee who had a 2006 @entity153 stall on her after its ignition slipped out of position while she was driving it			0
" i 'm thinking big recall , " the employee wrote — but that recall never came until this week			0
@entity220 asked @entity179 what @entity1 would do with such an e-mail if it was sent today , and @entity179 said @entity1 would take " immediate action			0
" @entity179 noted that @entity1 has recently hired 40 more safety investors			0
but when she acknowledged that most of them were promoted from within @entity1 , another member suggested @entity1 get some ' outside fresh blood			0

the cars , from the 2013 and 2014 models , were built with an incorrect baffle
that can cause the air bag inflator to rupture if the bags are deployed
it is the latest in a long list of recalls that have *blighted* @entity1 this year
total recalls cover 17 million vehicles in the @entity76 and 20 million worldwide
