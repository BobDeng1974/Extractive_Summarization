the plaintive song of a lone chestnut ­ - bellied wren sounds remarkably like the first three bars of @entity4			2
it sighs with unrequited love , like the heady ballads played by taxi drivers in tatty cars with swinging rosaries ; a soundtrack to debauchery and heartache			0
to talk of a safer @entity14 for tourists is a tiresome cliché			1
backpackers have plodded through its lush jungles , hit its sweet @entity21 beaches and partied in @entity23 for over a decade			0
what is apparent now is that @entity14 , too , have fallen for their country			1
like teenagers in the first throes of passion , discovering every beautiful quirk and stomach flip - after years of being locked into an era where the very idea of tourism in their country was anathema			2
@entity14 has more bird species than any other country , including the striking @entity39 in the capital ’s beautiful botanical garden , @entity43 , commercial director of @entity44 tells me : ‘ ten years ago my mother would n’t let me travel overland			1
‘ she told me i must fly			0
we knew nothing of our country ’s beauty - so we have been discovering it ever since			1
' i ’m here to explore the @entity54 area known as the ' cultural coffee landscape ' – a fertile triangle , roughly at the heart of @entity59 's most north - westerly country - whose main cities include @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
coffee country : the fertile , mountainous land between @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 the world 's finest : @entity68 tells the story of coffee from seed to cup at his @entity74 coffee plant the enormous mountains here touch the sky , and are dressed in a million @entity79 ferns and vines are so old i imagine a brachiosaurus munching high up in the canopy			1
my journey begins at @entity84 in @entity85 , a sanctuary in the cloud forest , brimming with over 300 species of bird and home to spectacled bears and paramo tapirs			1
a morning walk is lit up by iridescent tanagers , and i witness a male and female torrent duck having a domestic ( the stony glares and feathery turned backs say it all )			0
overnight , staying in the rustic lodgings laid on by @entity101 , the local community , i encounter more wildlife than i require , including a spider - on - cockroach attack			1
above the clouds : the magical @entity54 landscape is worthy of a @entity108 novel on top of the world : @entity111 pictured at the summit of the mountain within the @entity114 the second most famous @entity115 produced to a premium in @entity14 is as ethical as it comes at the @entity74 coffee plant , in @entity118			1
the company complies to the @entity120 , is @entity121 certified and employs single mothers to inspect the beans for quality			0
but co ­ - owner @entity125 tells me : ‘ i think people should be thinking this way anyway – being ethical is not what we sell our coffee on			1
’ a coffee baptism involves a journey around the plant from seed to cup , and my effervescent guide @entity68 leads the way			2
here is a man who visibly shudders at the mention of @entity142			0
all creatures great and small : butterflies and rare orchids fill the wild and beautiful @entity147 forest the resident white - tailed @entity148 perches on an electric cable at the @entity150 in the lab , i learn how to assess coffee on sight , fragrance , aroma and taste - learning the difference between fruity , acidic , animal ­ - like and woody scents , and tasting examples of what coffee should ( and should not ) taste like			1
proper @entity14 coffee is like chocolate , sunshine and cream , all bound by a single malt whisky by the fire			1
the farm is 2500 metres above sea level with lofty views over lush , green @entity174			0
@entity68 has over 4,000 sunset pictures on his phone			0
he tells a story of how the owner 's son died in a plane crash and started the coffee firm in his honour			2
family is often at the heart of business here			0
a paradise of blues and greens : the stunning scenery of @entity14 's cultural coffee landscape the @entity191 : a paradisaical mountain resting stop for walkers and birders at @entity199 , halfway up @entity147 - a stately mountain within @entity114 @entity196 and her five daughters between the ages of 13 and 20 provide hospitality , local guides and delicious food served in banana leaves			1
as well as hosting visiting birders and walkers , her plan is to live off the land			0
in the pristine forest that is her garden , she grows plantain , cacao , yukka , potatoes , coffee and a rainbow of delicious fruits			2
the farm , surrounded by mist , is paradisaical			0
rare and showy orchids perch in its trees ; emerald green hummingbirds hover and blue - grey tanagers perch around the breakfast table			2
there is even a natural swimming pool to splash in			0
@entity54 forest : the @entity114 is a great place to spot wildlife and birds creatures of the forest : a clown cricket and one of the country 's 14,000 species of butterfly following a 4am start , a drive over gnarled mud tracks ( which includes several stops to hack through foliage with a machete ) and a steep trudge uphill , i stand alone in a thicket on top of this mountain above the clouds - and hear a rustle			1
a tiny rufous spine tail darts and hops between branches just metres away			0
i may not be a bird fanatic , but it ’s just him and me for a moment , and it 's wonderful			2
at @entity147 's summit is an army base , clustered around the area ’s principal telecommunications hub			0
it was stationed there decades ago , when guerillas were in the habit of bombing such places			0
now it cuts a lonely figure , silent and engulfed by enormous fluffy clouds			0
dazzling : a @entity268 humming bird takes lunch at the @entity74 coffee plantation there are over 3000 orchid species in @entity14 , including its national flower ( right ) , the @entity273 birding continues to be big news here			1
there are more bird species in @entity14 than anywhere else in the world – 1,880 and counting ( including 87 endemics )			1
even to the avian - ignorant , to see a bright @entity283 swoop through the cloud forest with purpose and freedom is quite transcendental			0
the end to @entity14 ’s troubles could be the unclipping of her wings – and if you ’re up for adventure , she is ready to soar			2
