by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 02:07 est , 10 september 2013 support : former chancellor of the exchequer lord @entity2 backs tax breaks for married couples introducing a generous tax break for married couples would be the most cost - effective way to help families , a former @entity7 chancellor said yesterday			1
@entity2 backed the idea of a transferable tax allowance that would give married people extra money			1
but he said the prime minister ’s plans for a tax break worth an extra £ 150 a year is ‘ very limited ’ and should be ‘ much more generous ’			1
the intervention from @entity2 , who was chancellor in @entity20 ’s government , comes as backbenchers continue to push @entity22 and @entity23 to carry out their pledge to give married couples a tax break			1
mr @entity22 promised the transferable allowance worth £ 150 before the election in 2010			1
the prospect was raised again this summer			0
lord @entity2 backed transferable tax allowances – which mean a stay - at - home mother can shift her own income tax - free allowance to her husband – in a report on how to help families from the charity care			1
he said : ‘ the case for transferable tax allowances remains as strong as ever			0
‘ they are not only family friendly but provide a far more cost - effective means of reducing the tax burden on low - income households than can be achieved by an across - the - board increase in personal allowances			1
’ lord @entity2 was the chancellor who first proposed independent taxation of husbands and wives 25 years ago			1
yesterday ’s report said that the benefits of separate taxation were undermined by the failure to include transferable allowances			0
the @entity54 report said : ‘ since 1990 income tax rates have come down			0
in 1990 the basic rate was 25 per cent ; in 2013 it is 20 per cent			0
' the tax threshold for single people has risen significantly , with the result that the burden on such individuals has fallen			0
‘ by contrast , the tax threshold for families is scarcely higher in real terms than it was in 1990 , with the result that , even though the basic rate is lower , the income tax burden on some families is much the same as it was then			0
’ nearly there : although the former chancellor supports @entity22 's tax break , he does not think £ 150 - a - year is generous enough the report said that the tax system rewards individuals but shows ‘ insensitivity to family responsibility ’			1
it added : ‘ independent taxation was intended to give married women privacy over their tax affairs but the two million couples with children who have to claim tax credits , or , in future , @entity85 , have no privacy			2
‘ one - earner families face more fiscal discrimination in 2013 than they did in 1990 and marginal tax rates that apply to families are much higher than they were in 1990			2
’ the report said the unfairness had been worsened by changes to @entity98 , which have deprived higher - income one - earner families of the benefit while two - earner families on the same family income have kept theirs			0
the pressure group for stay - at - home mothers , @entity103 , welcomed @entity2 ’s comments			2
spokesman @entity106 said : ‘ unlike our current chancellor , @entity2 clearly appreciates the injustice in the current tax system towards stay - at - home parents			2
‘ we welcome his initiative 25 years later to remedy the injustice caused by a tax system which does not recognise the family unit			0
many more couples face a “ couple penalty ” today if they choose to live together as husband and wife than they did 25 years ago and this falls largely in the poorer half of the population			0
