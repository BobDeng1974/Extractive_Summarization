@entity59 to contribute going forward until @entity4 sat back late on			2

@entity9 : 7 quiet until he scored , which showcased his nose for goal			2
worked @entity98 again after the break			0

@entity58 : 7.5 terrific attacking threat with his overlapping runs but opened up by @entity82 and @entity85 for @entity9 goal			1
@entity126 : 6 summoned amid defensive reshuffle and a soft - spot in the heart of the back - four			0
