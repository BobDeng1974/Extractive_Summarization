@entity0 has landed a provocative blow ahead of sunday 's @entity3 clash with @entity4 , claiming @entity6 already ‘ loves @entity5 ’ and has ‘ no regrets ’ about returning to a different part of @entity9			1
@entity4 manager @entity10 has claimed his former star ’s priority was a summer move back to the @entity14 from @entity15			1
he ’s so happy : the way he plays , the way he ’s a member of the squad , the way he lives in this little blue village			0
it is like he ’s here for a long time			0
‘ if you ask him now if he regrets the move , i ’m sure he ’d say no. if you ask him if he ’d choose a different option , he ’d say no. and if you ask him where he thinks he ’ll be in five years , he ’d say he sees himself here in five years			0
’ despite the protracted and unsavoury manner of @entity6 ’s @entity4 departure in 2011 , @entity10 insisted ‘ he is a person i love ’ and called for fans to give him a ‘ respectful ’ reception			1
@entity5 boss @entity0 is hopeful noise from the @entity58 fans will drown out ' 3,000 red fans ' the @entity61 midfielder has scored one goal and picked up seven assists since the start of the season but @entity10 also claimed it was his decision to ignore @entity6 — and the buy - back option @entity4 held — once he learned he was willing to leave @entity15			1
@entity10 ’s call was shaped by the £ 42million signing of @entity17 as a replacement , although the @entity4 manager also indicated that @entity5 had wrapped up a £ 30m deal by the time he was aware of his former captain ’s availability			1
@entity10 even suggested that the deal had been agreed ‘ in early 2014 ’			2
asked if @entity6 wanted to return to @entity4 , @entity10 said : ‘ certainly , yes			1
i do n’t want to make a big story of that because you have to accept that			0
when he left , we bought @entity17			0
we were not in need of offensive players			0
‘ @entity6 , when he looks back at his career , will find that @entity4 and myself had a very positive influence			1
i have no personal animosity against @entity6			2
he is a person i love and a player i love			0
’ @entity89 ( left ) gets a shot away as @entity91 looks to challenge at @entity5 's @entity93 training ground @entity5 youngster @entity94 ( left ) holds off @entity95 as the @entity58 train @entity10 decided not to buy back @entity6 when he found out he was willing to leave @entity15 @entity10 indicated that @entity5 had wrapped up a £ 30m deal by the time he was aware of his availability @entity0 believes the reception @entity6 receives from @entity4 fans will be insignificant if the home supporters get behind the @entity102			1
@entity0 said : ' if @entity5 fans want , the reaction from @entity4 fans , nobody will listen			1
it depends on @entity5 fans			2
' if 40,000 blue fans want , no - one will listen to 3,000 red fans			0
it depends on the club culture			0
as you saw with @entity5 fans and @entity113			2
he added : ' @entity6 was – i do n’t say born – but made at @entity4 and the feeling should be good between the fans and him but i do n’t know			2
' like our @entity119 .			0

@entity6 will face his old club on sunday when @entity5 take on @entity4 at @entity3
@entity4 had first *refusal* on @entity6 in the summer but snubbed move for former captain
the @entity30 subsequently *joined* @entity5 in £ 30m deal and has starred for the @entity0 's side
@entity10 says midfielder *deserves* warm reception from travelling supporters
