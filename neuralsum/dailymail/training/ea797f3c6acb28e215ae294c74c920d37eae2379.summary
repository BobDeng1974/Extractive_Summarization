@entity3 heard how he took advantage of a series of vulnerable clients even though he knew that his family business was struggling and later went bankrupt			2
@entity2 has now been jailed for eight months after he admitted fraud and offences under unfair trading regulations			1
the donations that he took had been left in envelopes which also contained cards with heart - felt messages of support , which he also failed to pass on to grieving families			2
