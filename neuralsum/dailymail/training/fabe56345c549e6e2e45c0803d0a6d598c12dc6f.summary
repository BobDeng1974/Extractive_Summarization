billions poured into foreign aid by @entity2 is doing harm , casting doubt on the @entity6 's pledge to spend 0.7 % of national income on overseas aid the billions @entity2 pours into foreign aid are actually doing harm by making corruption worse in many parts of the world , a damning report reveals			1

the findings come just days after it emerged human rights abuses in @entity41 – where security forces are accused of burning , torturing and raping citizens – had got worse during a four - year period when the @entity2 gave the country more than £ 1billion			1
they will be hugely embarrassing for @entity47 , who has repeatedly been forced to defend his controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid despite fierce opposition from his backbenchers			1
the report was carried out by the @entity55 , the watchdog set up to scrutinise the @entity56			0

@entity83 , chief commissioner at the @entity55 , said : ‘ we saw very little evidence that the work @entity56 is doing to combat corruption is successfully addressing the impact of corruption as experienced by the poor			2
’ the @entity91 has massively increased @entity2 ’s aid budget in recent years in a bid to plough 0.7 per cent of national income into overseas development			1

where once bribes were paid out of sight , they are now paid openly			0
@entity2 gives money direct to the @entity71 government , despite the risk of corruption.the report said : ‘ this degree of engagement with a host government can be challenging , given the extent to which issues of corruption touch the government			2
