violent crime in @entity1 has fallen by a quarter in the past decade , according to a study			1
the @entity1 has experienced a ‘ substantial and sustained ’ fall in offences ranging from drunken thuggery to murder since 2003 , the report suggests			1
and official statistics show violent crime is now at its lowest level for 30 years			1
the @entity1 @entity12 study , published yesterday , also identifies the villages and towns across the country where crime is at its lowest , and the urban centres where it is still rampant			1
crime around the @entity1 : this map shows that the most peaceful areas of @entity1 are in the @entity22 countryside , with violence clustered around @entity24 and other major cities as well as in @entity26 fall : this graph shows how violent crime has tumbled in recent years after spiking between 2002 and 2005 falling crime : statistics from @entity30 , the @entity31 agency , show violent crime in @entity1 is falling faster than anywhere else 1 ) @entity1 ( @entity33 ) : from 27,618 in 2006 to 21,632 in 2009 ; -22 % change 2 ) @entity1 ( @entity22 & @entity35 ) : 1,205,065 to 1,001,322 ; -17 % 3 ) @entity36 : 145,209 to 131,610 ; -9 % 4 ) @entity1 ( @entity26 ) : 35,223 to 33,100 ; -6 % 5 ) @entity37 : 131,388 to 126,770 ; -4 % 6 ) @entity38 : 215,471 to 208,446 ; -3 % 7 ) @entity39 : 135,121 to 134,142 ; -1 % 8 ) @entity40 : 114,205 to 112,926 ; -1 % 9 ) @entity41 : 24,157 to 24,421 ; +1 % 10 ) @entity42 : 38,037 to 39,595 ; +4 % 11 ) @entity43 : 326,065 to 341,942 ; +5 % 12 ) @entity44 : 107,369 to 115,019 ; +7 % 13 ) @entity45 : 98,154 to 111,702 ; +14 % 14 ) @entity46 : 2,471 to 3,264 ; +32 % 15 ) @entity47 : 19,670 to 26,320 ; +34 % source : @entity30 ; each @entity50 country uses a different definition of violent crime			1
@entity53 in @entity54 was identified as the most peaceful council borough in @entity22 and @entity35			1
it contains three market towns and covers part of the @entity59			0
although it has a population of around 125,000 , only eight violent crimes were recorded in 2012			1
the most dangerous place to live is @entity64 in @entity24 where more than 400 violent crimes are carried out every month , and the other boroughs in the least peaceful five are also in inner @entity24			1
in a comparison of urban areas , @entity68 was identified as the city in the @entity1 with the worst crime rate followed by @entity24 and @entity73			1
@entity68 ’s murder rate is double the national average			1
the study was compiled from @entity78 statistics by the @entity79 , a think tank			0
it found that the homicide rate – which includes murders and other killings – has halved in a decade			2
overall , the violent crime rate was down by a quarter , from 1,255 crimes for every 100,000 people a decade ago to 933 last year			1
crime in @entity22 and @entity35 fell at a faster rate than the @entity31 average over that period , with eight in ten of local council areas experiencing a drop of at least 10 per cent			1
change : these graphs show how nearly every form of unrest has become less common in most areas of the country , although the red bars show that public disorder has risen in the majority of places capital : while @entity24 remains more violent than most other areas , as shown by the high violence indicated in the left - hand map , the green areas on the right - hand map shows that the unrest is decreasing league table : the most and least peaceful areas of the @entity1 , based on relative scores determined by a number of factors related to social unrest in the @entity1 , the only category of crime to increase sharply over the last decade was drug offences			1
the report said changes in police practices , an ageing population , a fall in alcohol consumption and the introduction of the minimum wage were likely causes			1
it also acknowledged a ‘ close correlation ’ between levels of violence and social breakdown , such as single parent households and high teenage pregnancy rates			0
but the authors dismissed the impact of more criminals being locked up			0
in the ten years since 2003 the prison population has increased by more than 7,000			2
some experts said , however , that the report was wrong to dismiss the effect of prison			2
@entity141 , of campaign group the @entity142 , said : ‘ crime is much lower than 20 years ago because twice as many criminals are in prison			2
‘ but the @entity1 is still a high crime society and people are right to worry about this			1
trends : drug offences are the only type of non-violent crime to have become more common since 2003 variation : @entity33 and @entity24 are the most dangerous regions , as this map shows , with the @entity24 the least a better police presence on the streets has been shown both to cut crime and to improve people ’s perceptions of crime rates			1
’ dr @entity163 , director of the @entity165 think tank , said a recession was often linked with lower violent crime because people had less money to spend			1
this meant alcohol consumption went down with the result that people were less likely to get into fights			0
but a recent report revealed that 80 per cent of the public think anti-social behaviour is on the rise			2
statisticians have also accused police of exaggerating falls in crime by downgrading crimes			1
the @entity184 found officers were under ‘ informal pressure ’ to meet crime reduction targets			2
the falls in crime figures in recent years have come despite cuts to police funding and officer numbers			2
they have boosted the argument made by @entity78 ministers that police can find efficiency savings and protect the front line while making essential spending cuts			2
homicide : the rate of murder and manslaughter in all areas of the @entity1 is far lower than in the @entity206 leading the pack : the @entity1 's violent crime rate has been falling faster than the rest of @entity210 technology : advances such as @entity213 , dna profiling and better burglar alarms have helped to deter criminals			1
drinking less : alcohol consumption has fallen in the past decade , leading to a reduction in street brawls and late - night attacks			0
fewer young people : demographics are often linked to crime rates as countries with a high youth population tend to be more violent			2
government policy : the introduction of the minimum wage and the raising of the school leaving age kept the poor and the young off the streets			0
the internet : one theory suggests that when people are able to communicate globally , they impose stronger taboos on violent crime because they are exposed to the judgement of others			1
@entity241 on lead : leaded petrol and lead - based paints seem to have affected people 's behaviour and made them more likely to commit crimes			2
abortion laws : a controversial study has suggested that the legalisation of abortion in the @entity206 helped lower crime rates			0
idyllic : @entity53 , in @entity54 , is the most peaceful area in the @entity1 with just eight weapons crimes last year contrast : the @entity24 borough of @entity64 has been named the most violent place in @entity1 - its murder rate is two and a half the @entity1 national average global scale : @entity210 is extremely peaceful compared to most other regions of the world within @entity210 : the @entity1 has fewer homicides than any other @entity31 country except @entity266 the @entity1 @entity12 is based on a combination of five factors - the rate of homicide , violent crime , weapons crime and public disorder , and the number of police officers , all drawn from @entity78 statistics			1
homicide and violent crime are given greater weighting in the calculation as they are considered most damaging to the general peace - each makes up 26.7 per cent of the score			1
police numbers account for 20 per cent of the final rating , with weapons crime and public disorder accounting for 13.3 per cent each			1
combining the five measures creates an artificial number between one and five for each region which allows all areas of the @entity1 to be directly compared with each other for their overall levels of violence			1
anyone listening to @entity297 ’s today programme yesterday morning was presented with a long list of possible reasons why crime in the @entity1 is falling			2
among the more credible answers raised were new police technology , the national dna database and @entity213			1
we were also told , more questionably , that it was possible the real reason was the rise of the internet , the removal of lead from petrol and even ‘ a new morality ’ taking hold across the @entity315			0
the discussion summarised perfectly what many commentators have always recognised : the @entity319 is desperate to find some reason other than prison to explain why crime is going down			0
a barely passing mention was given to what many criminologists regard as the most likely cause of the falling crime rate : the sharp rise in the prison population over the past two decades			2
since the mid- 1990s , when @entity332 instituted his ‘ prison works ’ policy , the number behind bars in @entity22 and @entity35 has shot up , and remained high			0
then , it stood at just over 40,000			0
now it is more than double that and regularly tops 84,000			0
at the same time , crime has fallen markedly			2
the @entity339 found it declined by 46 per cent between 1995 and 2008/09			0
the authors of yesterday ’s report , the little known @entity79 , were dismissive of such a link			0
but the evidence for ‘ prison works ’ is compelling			0
take one recent study by academics in the @entity37 , where politicians took a zero - tolerance approach to prolific offenders			0
drug addicts caught repeatedly stealing from homes or cars were jailed for two years instead of the usual community sentence or three months behind bars			0
on average , each already had more than 30 convictions ; some as many as 300			0
the results were overwhelming : crime fell by 25 per cent			0
in cities which locked up the most criminals , it fell by up to 40 per cent			0
like the @entity37 , this country has a small band of repeat offenders			0
more than 100,000 have at least 15 convictions and the worst repeat offenders are responsible for a third of all crimes			0
the other thing missing from yesterday ’s discussion was any mention of victims			0
for them , even short jail sentences work , by giving them relief from their attacker			0
what the @entity319 ca n’t see is obvious to victims of crime : when you lock criminals up for lengthy periods , they ca n’t do you harm .			0

@entity1 murder rate has fallen by half since 2003 and every region is safer
@entity12 based on homicide , violent crime , weapons , disorder , police
17 most violent areas were all @entity24 boroughs , headed by @entity64
but @entity68 ranked as the most violent urban area , ahead of @entity24
most peaceful area was @entity53 with just eight weapons crimes in 2012
report claims major factors for fall in crime are @entity213 and dna profiling
