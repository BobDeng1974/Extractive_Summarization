@entity0 , of the @entity1 , has defended taking celebrities to trial over historic sex abuse claims the chief crown prosecutor who put @entity7 actor @entity6 in the dock over historic sex abuse claims has hit back at critics who accuse him of mounting a ‘ witch - hunt ’ against celebrities			1
@entity0 used the example of an investigation into @entity14 , which took place in 2008 , while he was still alive , and was not brought to trial , to justify putting @entity6 , 81 , through four weeks in the dock			1
he insisted he had no regrets and would continue to bring cases regardless ‘ of who makes the complaint or who the complaint is against ’			1
mr @entity0 , head of the @entity1 in the @entity23 and the national leader on sexual exploitation of children , declined to comment on the @entity6 case after it ended in unanimous acquittals earlier this month			1
but he told delegates at a @entity31 ’s conference in @entity32 : ‘ i recognise that i ’m damned if i do and damned if i do n’t			0
everybody now accepts the decisions taken back in 2008 over @entity14 , for example , were wrong			1
we were the first to accept that in 2012			0
‘ but if we ’d prosecuted in 2008 and the jury had acquitted , would people be saying , “ you should n’t have brought those cases ” ? ’ the prosecutor acknowledged that he had been hurt by the wave of criticism directed both at him and the @entity1 as a whole			1
‘ i ’ve been called the @entity47 , the @entity48 and a host of other names			0
but criminal justice is not a ducking stool			0
it ’s due process : proper , thorough investigation followed by a prosecutor review , continuing review and the testing of witnesses in acourtroom			2
’ mr @entity0 steered away from actually naming the @entity7 actor , merely telling delegates : ‘ there was a case last week in which a man went to trial innocent and left that trial innocent			1
’ later in his speech he asked : ‘ do you all know the case i ’m talking about ? ’ there were murmurs of assent among the delegates			0
the prosecutor suggested that , rather than being a disaster , the @entity6 case had actually demonstrated the inherent fairness of @entity80 ’s jury system			2
‘ i would not want to live in a country in which everybody charged with an offence is convicted of that offence , ’ he said			0
tried : former @entity7 actor @entity6 ( left ) , 81 , and former @entity87 presenter @entity86 , 84 @entity0 said he approached the @entity6 case ‘ like any other ’			1
‘ what mattered were the allegations and the evidence and nothing else , ’ he insisted			2
he went on to say : ‘ it seems to have been overlooked by many that the trial judge , independent of prosecution and defence , decided that there was sufficient evidence for the case to progress			0
’ the criticism of @entity0 is in stark contrast to the praise that has been heaped upon him in the past			2
both the prime minister and the attorney general commended him for his decision to prosecute the @entity108 grooming gangs when others had baulked at doing so			0
and his pursuit of @entity86 was so thorough the entertainer eventually had no option but to plead guilty to a series of historic sex attacks on girls as young as nine .			0

@entity0 used 2008 @entity14 investigation , when he was not brought to trial , to justify putting @entity6 through four weeks in the dock
he insisted he had no regrets and would continue to bring cases regardless of ' who makes the complaint or who the complaint is against '
