by @entity0 @entity2 's pre-season preparations may be well underway , with the squad currently being whipped into shape by @entity5 at their training camp in @entity7 , but @entity8 is still on holiday following the @entity10			1
and , despite the debacle against @entity12 , he is in incredibly high spirits judging by his latest @entity15 post			2
he has snapped himself smiling in sunny @entity16 , with a cheeky grin on his face and a dolphin by his side			0
little wonder he 's in such a good mood again			0
all smiles : @entity8 swims with dolphins in sunny @entity16 frustrating : he is currently recovering from a disappointing @entity10 campaign with @entity25 but , in truth , whilst he may be feeling it as a fan , he can hardly be blamed as a player for @entity25 's @entity10 performance - despite his missed penalty in the last - 16 against @entity32			1
even as the likes of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 struggled , @entity8 's longest stint in game was against @entity12 , and there was only so much he could do in his 20 - minute cameo there with his side already 6 - 0 down			2
in the end , his only start came in the 3 - 0 defeat to @entity47 in the third - place play - off , so he should be plenty fresh when he does return from his extended break to the @entity52 fold .			0
