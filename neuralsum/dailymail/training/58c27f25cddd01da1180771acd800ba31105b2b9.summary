obsessed with selfies ? experts have linked selfies with mental illness and have suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle could in some cases be suffering from a confidence - related mental health condition dr @entity27 , a consultant psychiatrist at the @entity28 and @entity29 and @entity30 , told the @entity31 : ‘ two out of three of all the patients who come to see me with @entity16 ( @entity16 ) since the rise of camera phones have a compulsion to repeatedly take and post selfies on social media sites			1
’ he told @entity41 : ‘ taking selfies is not an addiction - it ’s a symptom of @entity16 ( @entity16 ) that involves checking one ’s appearance			1
’ cognitive behavioural therapy is often used to help patients moderate their obsessive behaviour relating to their appearance			0
sufferers of @entity16 can spend hours trying to take pictures that do not show any defects or flaws in their appearance , which they are very aware of but which might be unnoticeable to others			2
one expert said : ' taking @entity58 is not an addition - it 's a symptom of @entity16 that involves checking one 's appearance ( illustrated by stock image ) in one extreme case of the disorder , a @entity65 teenager @entity64 tried to commit suicide because he was unsatisfied with his appearance in the selfies he took			1
he was so desperate to attract girls , he spent 10 hours a day taking more than 200 selfies trying to find the perfect image , but his habit , which began at the age of 15 , caused him to drop out of school and lose almost two stone in weight			2
he did not leave his house in @entity80 for six months , and when he failed to take a flawless shot , he tried to kill himself by taking an overdose			0
his mother , @entity83 , managed to save him , but he was forced to seek medical help after his habit had spiralled out of control			0
he told the @entity31 : ' i was constantly in search of taking the perfect selfie and when i realised i could n’t , i wanted to die			0
‘ i lost my friends , my education , my health and almost my life			0
the only thing i cared about was having my phone with me so i could satisfy the urge to capture a picture of myself at any time of the day			0
' in an article for @entity99 , dr @entity100 , director of the @entity102 in @entity103 , said : ‘ @entity58 frequently trigger perceptions of self - indulgence or attention seeking social dependence that raises the ' damned - if - you - do and damned - if - you - do n’t ' spectre of either narcissism or very low self - esteem			1
' @entity16 is characterised by a preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in appearance , which are unnoticeable to others , according to the @entity116			2
as well as the excessive self - consciousness , individuals with @entity16 often feel defined by their flaw			1
they often experience an image of their perceived defect associated with memories , emotions and bodily sensations – as if seeing the flaw through the eyes of an onlooker , even though what they ‘ see ’ may be very different to their appearance observed by others			0
sufferers tend repeatedly to check on how bad their flaw is - for example in mirrors and reflective surfaces - attempt to camouflage or alter the perceived defect and avoid public or social situations or triggers that increase distress			0
people with @entity16 can find themselves housebound or seek out needless cosmetic surgery			1
they are also at an increased risk of suicide			0
‘ preoccupation with selfies can be a visible indicator of a young person with a lack of confidence or sense of self that might make him or her a victim of other problems as well			1
’ she believes that excessive or provocative taking of selfies is a form of ‘ acting out ’ in young people and can be a cry for help .			2

one **psychologist** from @entity30 , @entity28 , said that **talking** lots of selfies is not an addiction , but a symptom of @entity16 ( @entity16 )
while he does *n't* think a rise in the number of people taking lots of selfies will lead to more people with @entity16 , a doctor in @entity176 does
one @entity103 - based **psychologist** thinks **talking** lots of selfies is an indicator that someone has a lack of confidence
