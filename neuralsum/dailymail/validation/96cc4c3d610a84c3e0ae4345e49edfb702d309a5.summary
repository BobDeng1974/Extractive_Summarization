@entity0 has been given no assurances about a return to @entity4 ’s set - up in a phone call with the new power - broker of @entity8 cricket			1
mixed messages coming out of the @entity10 have left the impression the door is open to the maverick batsman , who was sacked last year after the @entity15 debacle			1
but incoming @entity10 chairman @entity16 , who takes over from @entity0 ’s arch - opponent @entity17 on may 15 , has spoken to the 34 - year - old and made it clear there are no guarantees — even if he scores heavily for @entity22 on his expected county comeback			1
@entity0 will return to @entity22 in the summer to play in the @entity24 incoming @entity10 chairman @entity16 has made it clear there are no guarantees @entity16 , who instigated the conversation , hoped to keep it confidential but the tenor of the chat was that @entity0 ’s @entity4 future rests entirely with the selectors , who would consider form as well as other aspects — such as upsetting team spirit — when picking the @entity38 side this summer			1
a number of players , led by captain @entity41 , would strongly resist a @entity0 comeback			0
though @entity16 told @entity0 he would not interfere with selection , having never done so as chairman of @entity45 , @entity0 ( right ) remains so enthused about the slim possibility of playing for @entity4 again that he will commit himself to @entity22 this season			1
he said while commentating on @entity49 at the @entity50 : ‘ if i can do anything that can help me get back into it for @entity4 , then it ’s something i want to do			0
’ @entity22 still have to agree the detail of @entity0 ’s re-engagement but he is expected to fulfil at least some of his £ 205,000 @entity57 contract with @entity58			1
he would then need some practice in red - ball cricket , which he last played in the @entity38 of january 2014 that completed the 5 - 0 ashes whitewash			0
@entity0 has hinted he could change his @entity57 contract in a bid to push for an @entity4 place after playing for the @entity66 's @entity65 , @entity0 has signed with the @entity58 @entity4 cricket managing director @entity67 said he watched every ball of that game and had never seen a player so disengaged from his team - mates			1
given the strong opposition of @entity73 and chairman of selectors @entity76 , @entity0 ’s hopes boil down to the side doing so badly against the @entity79 and @entity80 in the next two @entity38 series that radical changes are considered for the @entity15 , which starts in july			2
former @entity4 captain @entity83 has called @entity4 ’s current situation a ‘ soap opera ’ , and says the team need to beat the @entity79 3 - 0 to stop talk of a @entity0 comeback			2
‘ it is clear that for @entity0 to have any hope of playing for @entity4 — and it is only a small hope — he has to play county cricket and we will see what happens , ’ @entity83 said on @entity49			2
‘ the game needs a change , it needs someone to come in and say the past is the past and to start afresh			0
@entity16 is clearly going to do that			0
obviously it ’s going to ruffle a few feathers but maybe that ’s what they need			0
‘ maybe this is a fantastic motivational tool			0
if the team do n’t want @entity0 in the side then go to the @entity79 and win 3 - 0			2
play better , score more runs and win more games and @entity0 will never play again			0

@entity0 will line up for @entity22 in the @entity24
the 34 - year - old has spoken to incoming @entity10 chairman @entity16
no guarantees for @entity0 — even if he scores heavily for @entity22
