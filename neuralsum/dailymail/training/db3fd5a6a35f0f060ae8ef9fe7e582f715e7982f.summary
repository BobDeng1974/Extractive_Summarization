@entity0 has managed to shed over a stone to transform herself into suspender - wearing leading lady @entity2 for @entity3			1
while @entity0 may have gained notoriety as one of the sexiest women on tv when she played @entity8 in @entity10 soap opera @entity9 , even she was daunted by the thought of being scantily clad for the majority of the show			1
she overhauled her diet , switching to healthy alternatives of her favourite foods and rehearsing up to eight hours a day to lose an impressive 15 pounds			1
ultimately , 5ft 1in @entity0 dropped from 8st in october to 7st in january this year			1
@entity0 looks amazing in this weeks issue of ok ! where she opens up about loosing a stone @entity0 has lost 15 pounds since october , from 8st ( left ) to 7st ( right ) to shape up for her role speaking about her decision to trim down her her figure for the famous role , @entity0 said : ' if you put on a few pounds and you ’re not doing a job in the public eye , it ’s okay because when you ’re in the office you can hide under clothes or if you ’re at home you can hide behind your onesie			1
' so during the rehearsal period for @entity33 , i realised i needed to feel confident with my body to play that role with conviction because the audience can see if you ’re not comfortable			1
‘ when you ’re on television , or film , or on stage , you ca n’t hide – you have to be in the costume of that character and most of the time it ’s sexy or revealing			1
you have to be confident , ’ ‘ @entity2 is a wholesome @entity46 girl in the beginning , wearing a little pink dress , but that ’s only the first 10 minutes – for the next hour and a half i ’m in my underwear ! ’ ' by january i had gone down to 7st so they had to take my costume in			1
it ’s always been the other way round with me			0
in @entity9 they usually had to take the costume out as i was much bigger than the other girls			0
‘ and i feel better … i ’ve been saying to everybody it ’s not how i look , it ’s how i feel that makes a difference			0
' in an exclusive interview with ok ! magazine out today , the 30 - year - old also said that raspberry ketones supplements helped her shift the extra weight			1
there can be no doubt that @entity0 embodies her role as the sexy @entity2 in the shoot for ok ! as she shows of her newly trim figure lounging on a couch raspberry ketone is a fruit extract that claims to ' burn body fat ' and has been dubbed a ' miracle ' weight loss supplement by some			1
though raspberry ketone has been on the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) safe list since 1965 , it has only been marketed as a weight loss supplement since 2004 after a study in @entity85 found it prevented weight increases in mice on a high fat diet			1
no similar studies have been conducted on humans , and critics believe one would need to consume huge quantities of the product to see the same kind of results as the study with mice			0
but @entity0 is convinced the tablets have helped her with her weight loss			1
‘ i ’m doing eight shows a week so that ’s a lot of cardio , a lot of movement , a lot of dancing			0
that ’s like going to the gym eight times a week			1
that with the @entity109 tablets which i ’ve been taking once a day , they ’ve both contributed to my weight loss			2
' and it ’s really safe because it ’s a food supplement , it ’s not a slimming pill			2
it ’s something you take once a day to increase your fat breakdown , and because it ’s raspberries , it ’s natural			2
' if you can find something that has that natural ability to speed up your metabolism that is safe , that works well , that ’s great			0
especially with a woman ’s metabolism because i think it slows down when you get to a certain age			0
' ‘ i ’m a big fan of the @entity133 and i love @entity134 , and i ’d heard from them both that they ’d contributed to their weight loss with these ketone supplements that speed up your metabolism			0
@entity0 says when she was in @entity9 her costumes had to be taken out as she was bigger than the other actresses on the show , but says her weight loss has given her new confidence ‘ i ’ve always looked to the @entity133 as healthy role models because they ’re glamorous women and they ’re not trying to be skinny , they ’re celebrating their hourglass figures			1
that ’s what drew my attention , because i ’ve got an hourglass figure - i ’ve got a @entity152 bust			0
’ @entity0 admits that she has found maintaining her figure harder as she gets older , but says that she now makes health conscious choices when it comes to her food			1
' i just take the healthier options now			0
rather than eating those sugary cereals that we all love , i ’ll eat wholemeal toast with peanut butter , a banana , or porridge			0
i ’ve replaced all the @entity166 hot chocolates and drinks for teas , so i ’ll have a chamomile tea or a peppermint tea			0
' and that ’s better for my vocals too , because i have to sing six songs for @entity3 ' she says			0
the petite brunette has learned which foods are detrimental to her quest to drop the pounds , saying : ‘ i stay away from white bread , i do n’t have paninis or ciabatta			2
anything like that is the enemy to my waistline - because i ’m 5 ft 1in , it really shows when i put on weight			0
i just do n’t have the height to balance it out			0
' her revamped diet involves less processed and junk food			2
instead she eats nutritious food in smaller portions but more often			2
@entity0 's full interview is in this weeks ok ! magazine , out now describing a typical day the actress says : ‘ for lunch or dinner i ’ll have a jacket potato with beans or a stir - fry , but i make sure i do n’t have microwave meals because they do n’t fill you up			1
i also eat little and often , so i have five small meals a day , things that are going to give me energy for the show but are still good carbohydrates			1
' all my friends are actually coming to me saying , ‘ how have you lost a stone , every time i see you you ’re eating ! ’ , but it ’s about what you eat and when you eat			0
do n’t eat late at night – you know , i used to be the girl who put a pizza in the oven late at night , but not now			0
' but despite this virtuous diet and active lifestyle rehearsing her dance routines for the show , @entity0 confesses she is n’t depriving herself too much			1
‘ i ’m such a big fan of chocolate and chips , i usually ca n’t go a day without chocolate			2
but the thing is portion control – rather than eating an entire chocolate bar , i ’ll eat half and i ’ll put the other half in the fridge for the next day			2
‘ if you halve portions , you ’re still having a bit of what you love but you ’re not over-indulging			2
and twice a week , i ’ll still have my @entity234 on toast			0
i ca n’t deprive myself , so that ’s my little indulgence ! with this balanced attitude to her new diet and slim line figure , @entity0 is confident that these changes will be long lasting			1
she says : ‘ i ’m definitely going to maintain it			0
i think when most people hit their target weight they relax into it and then it creeps back up			0
' when i did @entity246 i think i lost a dress size , but it was muscle , it was n’t dieting , it was all from skating every day			2
when it came to an end my weight crept up again			0
' i will definitely be keeping up with the @entity253 supplements and i ’ll keep working out , because you have to eat properly and you must have some form of active cardio in your day to day life , because you ca n’t sit at home and eat a @entity260 takeaway and take a raspberry ketone supplement - it does n’t work like that ! ' @entity0 is starring in the @entity266 @entity265 tour till may 11th			1
