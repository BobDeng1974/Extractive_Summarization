by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 15 october 2013 one in 2,000 people in the @entity2 carries abnormal proteins linked to variant @entity4 - the human form of mad cow disease , new research has shown			1
experts said their study has ' important implications ' for how blood and blood donations are managed and for the handling of surgical instruments			1
the findings suggest a ' high prevalence of infection with abnormal prion protein , indicating @entity4 carrier status in the population '			2
but the researchers noted that , despite the higher number of carriers , just 177 vcjd cases have been reported to date in the @entity2			1
@entity4 is a fatal , degenerative brain disorder which is the human form of @entity29 ( @entity29 )			1
the disease is believed to have passed from cattle to humans through consumption of meat products contaminated with @entity29			0
large numbers of the @entity2 population were exposed to @entity29 prions in the late 1980s and early 1990s			0
the new study , published online in the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , involved analysis of more than 32,000 appendix samples from people of all ages who had their appendix removed between 2000 and 2012 at over 41 hospitals in @entity47			2
of these samples , 16 tested positive for abnormal prion protein , indicating that one in 2,000 of all people are likely to be carriers			0
the researchers , including a team from @entity47 , found that prion protein in those born between 1941 and 1960 did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985			0
presence of the protein was also similar in both men and women			0
the researchers expressed concern that some of the 16 samples produced information which might suggest people may be susceptible to developing the condition over a longer time than previously thought , or may not show any signs of disease at all			0
but they said the number of patients diagnosed with @entity4 is still well below the number suggested by the prevalence of abnormal proteins			1
professor @entity75 , lead investigator at @entity47 , said : ' prevalence studies such as this are important as they enable us to interpret the impact of the @entity29 epidemic on the population of @entity2 and strengthen the basis for ongoing risk assessments			2

177 vcjd cases have been reported to date in the @entity2 ' there are already extensive measures in place to prevent the potential spread of infection			1
' prion diseases can have very long incubation periods , and an understanding of prevalence can help researchers devise measures to prevent further transmission of the disease			0
' it is not known whether all infected individuals will develop disease			0
the peak of the @entity4 epidemic in the @entity2 was in 2000 , where 27 probable or definite cases were diagnosed that year			1
only one case of @entity4 has been diagnosed in 2013 in the @entity2			2
' he said further research on samples from the 1970s and earlier - before @entity29 appeared - were now underway to see whether prion proteins also occurred then , which could reduce the significance of the new findings			0
dr @entity120 , from the @entity121 at @entity123 's @entity122 , said : ' while the study is much needed and offers both confirmation and refinement of previous studies , further work is still required			0
further research on samples from the 1970s and earlier - before @entity29 appeared - are now underway to see whether prion proteins also occurred then , which could reduce the significance of the new findings ' given the high levels of infection indicated by this research it is now crucial we establish how many people in the @entity2 harbour that infection in their bloodstream in order to adequately assess the risks of transmission through contaminated blood donations			1
' studies to develop new blood tests for @entity4 must remain a priority to assist with screening and protecting the @entity2 blood supply			1
' professor @entity148 , a reader in infectious disease modelling at @entity150 , said : ' the results from this large - scale survey are important in confirming the presence of a higher prevalence of abnormal prion protein compared with the 177 confirmed cases of @entity4			1
' while the lack of new cases remains reassuring , these results highlight the need to maintain both case surveillance and precautionary measures to prevent onward transmission , over the coming decade			0

the abnormal proteins are linked to variant @entity4 ( @entity4 ) - the human form of mad cow disease
the @entity39 study has ' important implications ' for how blood and blood donations are managed and for the handling of surgical instruments
but despite the higher number of carriers , just 177 vcjd cases have been reported to date in the @entity2
