by @entity1 reporter new reports have revealed that the @entity3 had suspicions about @entity5 eight years before he committed the second - deadliest mass shooting in @entity8 history			1
the @entity3 reportedly went to the @entity9 , @entity10 home that he shared with his mother @entity12 in 2004 and asked about his computer activity but left before even sitting down with the then - 12 - year - old			1
@entity15 reports that @entity3 agents went to the family 's @entity18 home because they had tracked @entity5 online after he hacked through two layers of government security			1
under suspicion : @entity3 agents went to the @entity23 house in 2004 to question then - 12 - year - old @entity5 about how he had been able to hack through two layers of a government website 's security @entity27 , who would later be killed at the hands of her son , spoke to the officers and convinced them that there was no need for further questioning			1
' he 's a computer whiz , ' she told the agents , according to @entity15			2
' @entity5 was just testing himself			2
' the newly released report about the home visit is just one in a growing number of missed clues in the lead up to the december 14 , 2012 shooting that left 26 students and his mother dead before he turned the gun on himself			0
author @entity49 thoroughly researched the december 2012 shooting and wrote a book called ' @entity9 : an @entity51 '			0
first part of the murder scene : @entity3 officials questioned @entity12 at her @entity9 home in 2004 , and that is the same home where @entity5 shot and killed her eight years later before going to the elementary school in it , he discusses a previously undiscovered writing of @entity5 's where he rails against ' the system ' and talks about how he felt students were being brainwashed			1
' it goes without saying that an @entity67 and enough ammunition could do more good than a thousand ‘ teachers , ‘ if one is truly interested in reforming the system , ' @entity5 wrote a year before the @entity9			1
' in short time the children will be brainwashed , pumped full of @entity72 and told to conform , until they have been turned into the oppressors			0
' they ( the children ) are already dead			0
' in the weeks after the first anniversary of the shooting , @entity10 state investigators released their findings on the tragedy , showing what warning signs the 20 - year - old shooter left behind in his wake before killing himself as emergency responders arrived on the scene			0
covering ? @entity27 ( left ) told the officers that her son ( right ) was very bright and just challenging himself with the hacking , and the officers apparently found that sufficient enough that they did n't need to talk to him in fifth grade , @entity5 wrote @entity92 of @entity93 , in which the main character has a gun in her cane and shoots people , and another character talks of liking to hurt people , especially children			1

the report also said that in 2005 , @entity5 was diagnosed with @entity115 's disorder - an autism - like condition that is not associated with violence - and that he lacked empathy for others and behaved strangely .			0

@entity3 officers became suspicious of @entity5 when *hew* as only 12 because he had been able to hack past a government website 's security
his mother @entity12 was able to convince the agents that there was no cause for concern , that he was ' just testing himself ' with computer hacking
eight years later , he killed his mother , 26 people at @entity9 and then himself
