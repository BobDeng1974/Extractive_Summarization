cancer patients who receive several weeks of radiation treatment could soon be a thing of the past , with doctors developing an @entity5 - first single session therapy in a handful of minutes			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 has trialled a powerful new technique that could enable patients to safely receive their radiation treatment in a single , ten - minute session			1
@entity14 dr @entity13 said since 2010 , patients at the centre have been treated with high - dose @entity17 ( @entity18 ) over a six to eight week period			0
but a team of experts have used a combination of the complex modelling calculations to allow doctors to deliver higher dosages and reduce treatment time even further			0
' our medical physicists have now introduced an innovative method to predict the stereotactic beam to deliver to a tumour a ' knock - out punch ' of up to @entity44 of radiation in a single session over only a handful of minutes , ' dr @entity13 said			2
' this shift is particularly important for our older patients who can not lie still for prolonged periods and for others who are in discomfort due to their disease			0
' cancer patient @entity54 , 80 , was the first in @entity56 to undergo the treatment on friday dr @entity13 ( right ) with clinical research physicist associate professor @entity58 in @entity56 the @entity7 in @entity8 has trialled a powerful new technique that could enable patients to safely receive their radiation treatment in a single , ten - minute session @entity18 is used to treat small secondary tumours that have spread short distances from the primary tumour , or inoperable primary cancers in highly sensitive locations such as the lung , and is typically delivered over three to five treatment sessions of 40 â€“ 60 minutes each			1
cancer patient @entity54 was the first in @entity56 to undergo the treatment on friday with a small primary lung cancer in his right lung irradiated			1
the 80 - year - old was wrapped in a vacuum - sealed plastic slip while a 4d ct scanner tracked the tumour 's position , enabling treatment to be delivered with greater accuracy and fewer side - effects			0
' the location of the tumour makes it very difficult to operate or target with conventional radiation without affecting my healthy lung tissue , so this new technique has certainly come at the right time for me , and many others in my situation , ' @entity54 said			2
dr @entity13 said @entity18 has been a game changer for people with difficult to treat tumours patient @entity54 said the new technique has certainly come at the right time for him and many others ' the best news is i will be back at home in @entity101 tonight , and i will only need to return to @entity102 for follow - up appointments			1
' dr @entity13 added that @entity18 has been a game changer for people with difficult to treat tumours			0
' the sharp delineation of the stereotactic beam greatly reduces damage to healthy tissue and allows for a higher dose through faster , more targeted delivery of radiation therapy and now , thanks to the work of our team , we can deliver this in one controlled blow for some of our patients , ' dr @entity13 said .			0
