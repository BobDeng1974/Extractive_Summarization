enough is enough , @entity0 out , read one banner at the @entity3 on saturday			1
the poster was unfurled in the moments after @entity6 had given @entity7 a 2 - 0 lead			1
it was n’t big , probably the size of an @entity12 sheet of paper			0
its message , however , was significant			0
some @entity16 fans vented their frustration at @entity0 holding aloft the banner ' @entity1 is enough , @entity0 out ' during the game against @entity20 on saturday @entity21 looks crestfallen at the full - time whistle as his own goal contributes to @entity16 's defeat the disgruntled fan immediately had the sign confiscated by a steward , so as not to incite angry exchanges with those who remain @entity30			1
the @entity35 ’s job , despite their desperate start to the season , is safe			0
the only way @entity0 leaves @entity16 is if he walks			1
like it or not , @entity16 fans have at least another two - and - a - half years of him			1
@entity16 had nine players in front of the ball when @entity7 broke and scored a decisive second through @entity6 at the @entity3 on saturday evening @entity7 have won 11 and drawn three of their last 15 matches against @entity16			1
but what can @entity0 do to halt the gradual sea change in opinion of those who used to worship the ground he walked on ? sorting out his side ’s leaky defence would be a good starting point			2
at the moment , @entity16 are susceptible to counter attacks ; @entity0 knows it			2
so , too , does @entity57			0
when asked if he felt @entity16 were vulnerable to being caught on the break following @entity7 ’s win at the @entity3 , their @entity59 manager replied : ‘ that ’s why i played this formation			1
yes , it was a risk but i was sure @entity16 wanted to attack and to press us			0
@entity7 captain @entity6 celebrates scoring his side 's second in their 2 - 1 win at @entity16 ‘ then , you know that @entity16 is giving a lot of space away and then @entity73 and @entity74 have to defend			1
' that ’s why i put @entity77 against @entity73 and @entity78 against @entity79			0
that ’s why i brought on @entity81 for more pace			0
’ @entity84 ’s comments are likely to have @entity16 assistant manager @entity85 clenching his fists in frustration			0
a rival manager pinpointing @entity16 ’s defence as a weakness wo n’t sit well with the former @entity92 centre half			2
injuries to key defenders @entity95 and @entity97 have n’t @entity93 has the fact @entity0 failed to replace @entity99 , who left for @entity100 in the summer			0
@entity92 boss @entity0 brought on @entity101 - his first appearance since august due to injury - but despite scoring the @entity35 could n't prevent the @entity92 falling to another defeat but throwing men forward in search of goals has cost @entity16 in three consecutive games — two of which they were winning			1
how can this team show such indiscipline with @entity85 ’s wealth of defensive knowledge at their disposal ? perhaps it ’s time for @entity0 to dilute his attacking principles and work on resolving the defensive deficiencies that are ruining their season			2
and who better than @entity85 , who made 372 appearances for @entity16 , to help right the current wrongs ?			0

@entity16 lost 2 - 1 at home to @entity7 on saturday evening
the @entity92 now find themselves 15 points behind the leaders @entity128
some fans have called for @entity0 to be sacked
an ' enough is enough , @entity0 out ' banner was on show at the @entity3
