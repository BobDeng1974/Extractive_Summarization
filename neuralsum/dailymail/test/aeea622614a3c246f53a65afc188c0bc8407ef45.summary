the slip has n’t happened and @entity1 are looking strong			1
they are top of the league with six games to go and only @entity5 are better placed , theoretically , with two games in hand to make up a four - point deficit			1
there will be a slip , there will be a surge and there will be tears			2
theory wins , romance loses			2
life at the top , as it was then			0
dejected @entity5 players during their 4 - 2 derby defeat to @entity21 on sunday @entity1 players celebrate @entity24 's opening goal against @entity25 on monday @entity5 currently have a four - point lead over @entity1 in the race for the final @entity29 place today , the last meaningful race among the top teams is between @entity1 and @entity5			1
but the context is different			0
@entity5 lead @entity1 by four points and each has played 32 games			1
the stakes are astonishing , but only because the @entity29 is an extremely big deal and they are currently in a pursuit for that last spot in the top four			1
these days it is @entity1 doing the chasing			1
they have had their own problems this season but the nitrous balloon has not burst			0
so , what of @entity5 ? the numbers are woefully inadequate			1
some examples : city have nine points fewer than at this stage last season ; their 4 - 2 defeat against @entity21 saw them concede four for the first time since 2009 ; they have lost four of their past six @entity58 games and five in 2015 , which is one more than in the whole of 2014			1
they have gone from being champions to contenders to weak also - rans , a side that has amassed two wins , three defeats and three draws in eight games against the rest of the current top five			0
@entity5 profited from a @entity1 collapse to claim the @entity58 title last season @entity72 's infamous slip against @entity73 was the moment the title pendulum swung towards @entity76 @entity1 's surrender of a three - goal lead at @entity79 also cost them the title last season april 19 @entity80 ( @entity81 ) april 25 @entity82 ( @entity81 ) may 3 @entity83 ( a ) may 10 @entity84 ( @entity81 ) may 17 @entity85 ( a ) may 24 @entity86 ( @entity81 ) april 25 @entity87 ( a ) april 28 @entity88 ( a ) may 2 @entity84 ( @entity81 ) may 10 @entity73 ( a ) may 16 @entity79 ( @entity81 ) may 24 @entity89 ( a ) when they fell behind against @entity21 they collapsed			1
that , perhaps more than the result , could be what crushes @entity94 in the final analysis			1
they are a team seemingly without spirit or direction			0
@entity99 and @entity100 are free to leave in the summer , which would indicate an acceptance from the rulers above that major changes are needed			0
which brings us back to @entity1 , a team that had far less of a choice in its major change to personnel last summer			1
@entity111 went and the void became a black hole , apparently sucking the energy out of the rest of them			0
@entity1 fell , but @entity1 climbed again and here they are			1
it says plenty about each side ’s season that on december 28 the gap between them was 18 points			2
@entity123 faced heavy scrutiny and he still does – questions over the use of the @entity111 money not least among them			0
but it is a measure of the manager that they have kept their gloves up			0
they were poor in recent defeats against @entity135 and @entity21 and they were far from their best in the subsequent wins against @entity140 and @entity25			2
but they found ways to win and , as such , will contest an @entity144 semi-final and hold an outside chance of a top - four place in the league			1
certainly , and rightly , @entity123 will face flak if success is not found on either front			0
@entity94 has come under mounting pressure following a poor run of results influential players such as @entity99 could be going through the @entity156 exit door in the summer @entity123 has masterminded @entity1 's return to form at the perfect time @entity123 will hope the controversies over @entity24 's contract and hippy crack taking do not affect the youngster 's performances and @entity1 's run - in but what he has proven again is that he can inspire this dressing room ; he can still generate motivation in a group that has had a mediocre season and among whom is a leading player unhappy with his contract situation			1
the longer serving among the squad at @entity85 still talk of a man who ‘ knows the name of every cousin ’			0
an exaggeration , certainly , but it is worth noting that almost two years after his departure , players and staff from @entity85 were still using his man - management as a reason to suggest life under @entity186 , a cup winner at the club , was not as good			2
there are few such testimonies for @entity94 , whose job surely depends on the outcome of this run in			2
city face @entity80 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
four of those are at home			0
@entity1 play @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity84 , @entity73 , @entity79 and @entity89 , as well as an @entity144 semi-final against @entity82			2
four of those league games are away from @entity199 , but like @entity5 , it is not a run - in that would have one cursing their luck			1
it is a shootout , then , between a side that still has a spark and another that appears desperate for the season to end			0
from this point last season , @entity5 took five wins and a draw from their last six games to take the title			2
they were storming towards the line			0
a year on , they look as if they would blow over in a decent breeze .			0

12 months *ago* , it was @entity5 who reeled in @entity1 to win the league
now , the boot is on the other foot as @entity226 hunt fourth place
the gap currently stands at four points but @entity5 are in *freefall*
derby loss to @entity21 has *increased* the pressure on @entity94
@entity1 , by contrast , may have come good at the perfect moment
missing out on @entity29 is *unthinkable* for both clubs
