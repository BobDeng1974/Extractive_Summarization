a @entity1 university has voted to pull down a statue of a notorious @entity4 colonialist after students threw a bucket of excrement at it			1
bosses at the @entity10 bowed to demands to remove the statue of @entity13 after a series of protests on campus			1
@entity10 , the oldest university in @entity1 and regularly ranked as the best on the continent , was built on land donated by @entity13 , a mining magnate who died in 1902			1
excrement was launched at the statue during one protest but the ' poo protest ' was launched by a small group of students earlier this month , sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue be torn down			1
many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule , but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid			0
the large statue of a notoriously racist @entity46 gazing across an @entity1 that he coveted for the @entity4 empire made them feel alienated on a campus still dominated by white staff , they said			1
on friday , the university senate voted 181 to one to remove the statue permanently from the campus , after vice-chancellor @entity53 acknowledged ' the many injustices of colonial conquest enacted under @entity13 ' watch '			1
while the university council still has to endorse the move at a special meeting on april 8 , the statue will be boarded up until it is handed over to government heritage authorities , university spokeswoman @entity57 said			1
' it is certainly a victory for us , ' said student representative council president @entity67			0
' it means we are being heard by the larger community			0
' @entity13 ( pictured ) made his fortune with his @entity72 mining company @entity13 was born in @entity73 in @entity74 and went on to became one of @entity4 's most successful colonialists			1
he was sent to southern @entity1 in the late nineteenth century when he suffered bad health as a teenager			0
within four decades he had established political control of @entity4 's @entity80 , expanded the territory north to found @entity82 and taken ownership of the world 's richest diamond mining company @entity72			0
his expansionist plans were fired by a dream of securing a @entity4 corridor of power stretching from @entity90 to @entity91			0
but his short life was blighted by bad health and he died of heart failure aged just 49			0
following his death @entity13 ' remains were transported by train from @entity90 to @entity99 and laid to rest in the @entity100 south of the city , his favourite spot in the vast empire he had helped secure for @entity4 in southern @entity1			2
@entity13 , famous for dreaming of a @entity90 - to - @entity91 railway , made his fortune with his @entity72 mining company during the @entity104 diamond rush , and went on to grow his wealth during the ensuing gold rush around modern - day @entity107			1
but the disappearance of @entity13 is unlikely to end the debate on racial transformation launched by the protest , which gave rise to similar demands for change at two other universities			1
in the east coast city of @entity120 , students at the @entity118 splattered white paint and anti-racism slogans on a statue of @entity4 's @entity124 and at @entity126 in the @entity90 , activists want the institution to be renamed			2
the protests have also sparked debate among academics , historians , politicians and writers of letters to newspapers			0
students have dismissed the argument that @entity13 should be honoured for donating land for the campus , saying he stole it from black @entity141 in the first place			1
a ' poo protest ' was launched by a group of students sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue ( pictured ) be torn down @entity149 , an author and commentator who attended @entity126 and won a prestigious international @entity151 to @entity152 , said in the @entity153 : ' @entity1 universities remain a testament to the country 's colonial heritage in terms of what they teach , who does the teaching , and the morally odious symbols that haunt our campuses or lurk in their very names			1
' at @entity13 , 83 per cent of senior management staff remain white and 77 per cent of " professionally qualified staff , " a category that includes academic teaching staff , are white , ' he said			2
whites make up about eight percent of @entity1 's population of some 54 million			0
@entity149 , who is of mixed race , defended the fact that he accepted a @entity13 scholarship , telling a radio interviewer that in moral terms the colonialist 's money belonged to ' the millions of black @entity1 whose rights were trampled on '			2
he took the scholarship to @entity152 ' so that i could come back and show the middle finger to his legacy , ' @entity149 said			0
since the end of apartheid the names of some cities and streets deemed offensive have been changed , but monuments to @entity1 's racist white - minority rule remain scattered throughout the country			0
much of that can be attributed to the racial reconciliation policies of @entity194 , who became the country 's first democratically - elected president in 1994			0
another former @entity151 , @entity198 , wrote in @entity1 's @entity153 newspaper of his surprise when @entity194 agreed in 2002 to have his name coupled with that of @entity13 in a new charitable organisation			2
the @entity204 , of which @entity198 is now executive director , provides post-graduate scholarships to young @entity141			0
many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule , but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid students have dismissed the argument that @entity13 should be honoured for donating land for the campus , saying he stole it from black @entity141 in the first place ' @entity194 told us to expect controversy and embrace it , while remaining certain in the knowledge that what we were actually doing was what mattered , ' @entity198 wrote			1
' he said ... whenever possible , we had to put history to work for a better future			0
' arts and culture minister @entity227 echoed @entity194 's approach in his response to the @entity10 protests			2
' the government 's attitude and policy to all heritage sites - including statues of former imperialists like @entity13 , among others - is based on a national policy of reconciliation , nation - building and social cohesion , ' he said .			2
