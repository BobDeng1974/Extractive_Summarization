' we will work diligently to assure student - athletes competing in , and visitors attending , next week 's @entity74 in @entity5 are not impacted negatively by this bill , ' @entity13 said			2
' moving forward , we intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce			0
' an online push for the @entity0 to react to the bill began earlier this week , carrying the hashtag # @entity83			2
former professional basketball player @entity85 , the first openly gay athlete to play in the @entity86 , tweeted : ' @ @entity87 , is it going to be legal for someone to discriminate against me & others when we come to the # @entity93 ? ' a pressure group called the @entity95 asked thursday for the @entity0 , the @entity96 , the @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 to pull their events from @entity5 over the next 16 months			1
the @entity96 holds its football championship game in at @entity22 and has a contract to remain there until 2021			2

@entity35 said in a statement thursday that the new law , patterned after a federal law signed in 1993 by president @entity115 , ensures ' religious liberty is fully protected			1
' ' @entity117 and the @entity118 both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion , but today , many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action , ' he said			0
reaction to the decision was swift and divided			0
@entity129 president and ceo @entity128 praised the new law , saying it would give abortion opponents legal recourse if they are pressured to support the procedure			0

@entity140 - it : look for gay - rights protests next week when the @entity1 comes to @entity7 's largest sports arena , @entity22 mixed reactions : a window sign on a downtown @entity5 florist shows its owner 's objection to the @entity149 bill passed by the @entity7 legislature @entity151 , the gay rights group that led a successful 2014 fight against efforts to add a gay marriage ban to the state constitution , called it ' a sad day for @entity7 , ' saying @entity35 and lawmakers ignored concerns of thousands of @entity7 residents			1
' we made it clear that this law will only be used to harm other @entity163 , and that 's not the @entity7 way			2
the lawmakers did n't listen			0
the governor did n't listen , ' the group said in a statement			0
@entity170 : @entity172 gov. @entity171 says he 'll sing a similar law if his state 's legislature passes it at least two groups – the @entity176 ( @entity177 ) and @entity178 – have said they would reconsider plans to hold their conventions in @entity5 because of the legislation			1
gen @entity178 is a videogaming convention that drew 56,000 people – most of them young – last year , making it the city 's largest convention in both economic impact and attendance numbers			0
the ceo of the @entity191 technology company @entity190 told the @entity192 his company would reduce its investment in the state , specifically because of the new law			0
supporters say discrimination concerns are overblown and that the @entity7 measure merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide services like catering or photography for same - sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds			1
they note that similar laws are already on the books in 19 states			0
last year , @entity211 enacted its own religious freedom law just weeks after @entity214 gov. @entity213 , a @entity36 , vetoed a similar effort there amid criticism from large corporations concerned about its impact on doing buiness in the state			1
' this bill is not about discrimination , and if i thought it legalized discrimination in any way in @entity7 , i would have vetoed it , ' @entity35 said thursday			1
' for more than 20 years , the federal @entity229 has never undermined our nation 's anti-discrimination laws , and it will not in @entity7			2
' @entity233 , national president of the @entity234 , held his own press conference with one anchored by @entity171 , the @entity172 governor counfounding expectations : @entity36 @entity213 , then @entity214 's governor , vetoed a similar bill in 2014 before leaving office the nation 's political climate is vastly different from what president @entity115 saw in 1993 , however : the @entity246 @entity245 is expected to rule this year on whether gay marriage bans violate the @entity246 @entity117			1
the @entity5 chamber of commerce opposed the bill on the grounds that it could make it more difficult to attract top companies and employees			0
similar bills have been advancing this year in the @entity172 and @entity255 legislatures			0
@entity172 @entity36 gov. @entity171 said thursday that if his state 's lawmakers send the bill to his desk , he 'll sign it into law			1
' i think it 's a bill that puts a high priority on religious freedom and recognizes that as a part of the balance , ' @entity171 told reporters at a news conference after @entity35 signed his state 's bill			1
elsewhere at the state @entity271 in @entity273 , @entity234 president @entity233 told journalists that the legislative push ' is a concerted effort by a hateful political faction to say that @entity172 does not welcome all its citizens , sending a clear message that this state is not open for business – and all this is happening on gov. @entity171 's watch			1
@entity233 's organization is @entity246 's wealthiest and most powerful gay rights group			1
the latest changes to the @entity172 bill , tweaked on wednesday night , give liberal lobbyists some ground by agreeing that complying with federal law counts as a ' compelling government intetest			0
' but @entity233 said thursday that his group was n't satisfied			0
' you can put lipstick on a pig , but it 's still a pig , ' he said			0
@entity296 @entity35 @entity35 delivered a brief statement during a news conference on thursday , after signing the controversial bill into law : ' today i signed the @entity229 , because i support the freedom of religion for every @entity304 of every faith			1
' @entity117 and the @entity118 both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion but today , many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action			0
' one need look no further than the recent litigation concerning the @entity315			0
a private business and our own university of @entity319 had to file lawsuits challenging provisions that required them to offer insurance coverage in violation of their religious views			0
' fortunately , in the 1990s @entity327 passed , and president @entity115 signed , the @entity229 — limiting government action that would infringe upon religion to only those that did not substantially burden free exercise of religion absent a compelling state interest and in the least restrictive means			2
' last year the @entity245 upheld religious liberty in the @entity338 case based on the federal @entity229 , but that act does not apply to individual states or local government action			2
at present , nineteen states — including our neighbors in @entity345 and @entity346 — have adopted @entity229 statutes			0
and in eleven additional states , the courts have interpreted their constitutions to provide a heightened standard for reviewing government action			0
' in order to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected under @entity7 law , this year our @entity353 joined those 30 states and the federal government to enshrine these principles in @entity7 law , and i fully support that action			2
' this bill is not about discrimination , and if i thought it legalized discrimination in any way in @entity7 , i would have vetoed it			0
in fact , it does not even apply to disputes between private parties unless government action is involved			0
for more than twenty years , the federal @entity229 has never undermined our nation 's anti-discrimination laws , and it will not in @entity7			2
' @entity7 is rightly celebrated for the hospitality , generosity , tolerance , and values of our people , and that will never change			0
faith and religion are important values to millions of @entity163 and with the passage of this legislation , we ensure that @entity7 will continue to be a place where we respect freedom of religion and make certain that government action will always be subject to the highest level of scrutiny that respects the religious beliefs of every @entity304 of every faith			1

look for gay rights protests at @entity22 as the men 's college basketball tournament comes to @entity5 , where the @entity0 is based
law signed thursday *trumps* state and local statutes that force business owners to serve the *public* in ways that violate their religious beliefs
gay rights groups see the measure – the 20th of its kind in @entity246 – as a back - door license to discriminate
@entity36 gov. @entity35 signed it while *insisting* that it brings @entity7 in line with a 1993 federal religious - protection law signed by @entity115
@entity35 is a long - shot but still in the hunt as a *potential* 2016 @entity36 presidential nominee
