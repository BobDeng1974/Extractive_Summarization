@entity1 ’s streets have been paved in purple , and gold , as the city embraces football and its newest sports team			1
@entity10 face @entity8 ’s future club @entity11 in a battle of the @entity14 debutants on sunday evening in @entity17 ’s @entity16 stadium			1
but the night before , the city was gripped with football fever as the club created their own festival downtown			2
everything was awash with the purple and gold - trimmed @entity24 kit			2
former @entity27 midfielder @entity26 has guided @entity10 to the @entity14 after four years of hard work sunday 's match will take place at @entity17 's @entity16 , which was a venue at the 1994 @entity33 @entity32 a city has warmly welcomed its newest arrival , coming out in their hoards and spending their hard - earned dollars to don the gear and get behind the team			1
there was even a band brought in to play live to the thronging masses where a whole street was closed off			0
at one stage , as an item of clothing was thrown amongst the crowd it caught in a light fixing above			0
' that 's for the soccer gods , ' the lead singer roared and the audience duly erupted in delight ( perhaps not the person who lost their jacket )			0
in a country where @entity59 , basketball and ice hockey already vie for the nations ' attention , he could even be forgiven for calling it ' soccer			0
' but they might have to start finding a new name for their beloved @entity68 if football keeps growing over here at this rate			2
@entity72 have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase @entity79 is expected to make his @entity14 debut against @entity81 on sunday for @entity72 @entity83 star @entity82 will also play in the match on sunday , for the new @entity14 franchise @entity10 @entity1 ’s main other sports team , basketball ’s @entity86 , are struggling and in these parts a new rival has waltzed in			1
the entire city was painted purple leading up to the match ; signs , posters and banners everywhere			0
@entity95 certainly know how to celebrate a sporting occasion			0
the pre-match partying went well into the early hours , but they did not let sore heads stand in the way of preparing for the game			0
the fans were out in force again in the hours leading up to kick - off , the smell of barbecues strong in air around the stadium as they set up marquees and settled in for the long haul			2
@entity8 will join the @entity14 revolution at @entity72 in the summer when his loan at @entity111 ends @entity10 tweeted this about how @entity8 wo n't be at the game and wrote : ' sorry , @entity8 - we 're sold out ' @entity8 and @entity115 are soon to join the league , this summer , but even before then they already have @entity82 , once considered the greatest player on the planet , at @entity10 and @entity79 at @entity72 , amongst a growing list of prominent names			1
hopefully saturday night ’s celebrations did not keep up the @entity72 squad staying in a nearby hotel , where just that morning @entity124 , their director of football operations , had sat having a contrastingly quiet and relaxed breakfast with his family			1
there is a sell - out 63,000 - strong stadium to entertain			2
@entity82 - @entity10 the @entity83 won the @entity129 back in 2007 , so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new @entity14 franchise @entity10			1
he may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass			0
@entity8 – @entity72 fc one of two high - profile signings made by @entity72 on their introduction to the league			1
@entity8 won more than 100 caps for @entity144 and 11 major trophies with @entity146 in 13 years			0
he is due in @entity72 in the summer once he has finished playing with @entity111			1
@entity115 – @entity147 the @entity149 midfielder will become the second former @entity144 captain to join @entity147 following the successful period of @entity152			2
like @entity8 , @entity115 will not join @entity147 until the summer once the @entity153 has finished			0
he will link up with former @entity155 team - mate @entity154			0
@entity79 - @entity11 @entity156 became @entity72 ’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping @entity160 win @entity158 last season			1
he has spent time on loan at @entity164 in the @entity166 @entity165 and he will be expected to score the bulk of @entity72 ’s goals in their debut season			1
@entity171 - @entity172 overshadowed by brother @entity173 in @entity144 but since moving to @entity14 he has been the star man for the @entity172			1
he won the @entity174 last season with 27 goals in 32 games			0
with the departure of @entity178 and @entity179 he could struggle to score as many this term .			0

@entity10 take on @entity72 in their @entity14 opener on sunday night
it is the battle of the debutants at the @entity16 stadium in @entity17
@entity1 captain @entity82 is expected to start for the hosts
