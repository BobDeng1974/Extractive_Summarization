a gaffe - prone crime tsar dubbed the ' @entity1 of law enforcement ' is being investigated by an independent watchdog over whether she was uninsured during a road smash			1
the @entity5 has taken over the probe into @entity8 police commissioner @entity7 - who was initially being investigated by her own force			1
the £ 85,000 - a - year crime chief , who appeared in a widely - derided @entity12 documentary about her role earlier this year , crashed her soft - top @entity14 into another car before hitting a tree in @entity17 , @entity8			1
today the @entity5 confirmed mrs @entity7 ' office had referred the investigation to it two weeks ago			1
if mrs @entity7 was found guilty of a charge of driving without insurance , she could be fined £ 300 and hit with six penalty points on her licence			2
a statement by the watchdog said : ' details of the accident in @entity35 , @entity17 , on 16 september , were referred to the @entity5 by the office of the @entity37 for @entity8 on 26 september			1
' following an assessment it has been decided that an independent @entity5 investigation is necessary to determine whether @entity7 may have committed a criminal offence			2
@entity7 ' insurance was allegedly expired when her soft - top @entity14 collided with another car and a tree ' the investigation will be overseen by @entity5 commissioner @entity46			1
' an @entity5 spokesman told @entity48 it had taken over the probe because mrs @entity7 could not be investigated by her own police force			1
he said : ' any potential criminal matters involving @entity53 or their deputies have to be referred to the @entity5 , and in most circumstances we investigate '			2
he could not give an indication of how long the investigation would take			0
police forces often bring prosecutions for driving without insurance after making a check on a national database which takes only a few minutes to complete			0
a spokesman for mrs @entity7 said neither she nor her office would be making any comment			0
she added : ' it 's an @entity5 investigation			0
' the crash happened on the outskirts of @entity17 while mrs @entity7 was driving to a meeting			1
controversy : mrs @entity7 also came under fire for hiring @entity73 as her youth crime commissioner shortly after being elected for the job			1
the 17 - year - old stepped down after posting offensive remarks on @entity78 on what her ' @entity80 ' meant : ' oh @entity81 , i 've got no idea - i ca n't tell you actually - i was n't thinking i 'd be talking about the actual onion ( the concentric circles ) as we call it - umm i do n't know know really - everything 's important			2
' on her job : ' oh dear , what is a police commissioner ? right , well it 's not the police commissioner , it 's the @entity37			0
' it 's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do , but there is no actual job description			0
' on her @entity104 battle bus : ' my budget is £ 317million , £ 15,000 is money well spent - i could have had a top of range @entity14 , but it 's not my image			0
' she suffered minor injuries and tweeted : ' hit an unforgiving tree ! shaken , sore and bruised , but thankfully ok			0
’ mrs @entity7 , who travels around in a ' battle bus ' dubbed @entity21 , has faced a string of controversies since she was elected to her post as a political independent in 2012			2
she came under fire after she appointed @entity73 , then aged 17 , as @entity120 's first youth crime commissioner			1
miss @entity73 later resigned from the £ 15,000 - a - year job after making offensive comments on her @entity78 feed which were revealed by @entity23			0
the former teacher then apologised this summer after taking part in a @entity12 fly - on - the - wall documentary which rank - and - file officers said had made her a ' laughing stock '			1
in meet the commissioner - which led @entity78 users to compare her to the gaffe - prone comedy characters @entity1 and @entity133 - she struggled to explain what her role involved , failed to write her title correctly on a whiteboard and was filmed painting her ' flaky ' nails			2
she also said in the hour - long programme that driving a @entity14 was not her ' image ' - and she was then filmed in the next shot arriving at work in a @entity14			0
pressure on mrs @entity7 later intensified when it emerged her second youth crime tsar , @entity144 , faced allegations of a relationship with a married former councillor			1
high - profile : mrs @entity7 has faced criticism of her £ 85,000 - a - year role as @entity8 police commissioner former @entity153 torchbearer @entity151 , 20 , replaced miss @entity73 - but stepped away from making public engagements when reports of the relationship surfaced			1
the former councillor involved later said the pair had been ' good friends '			0
a former head of the @entity162 , mrs @entity160 won a landslide 47 per cent of the vote in the 2012 , smashing second - placed conservative candidate @entity165 who won 25 per cent			0
but the turnout was just 16 per cent , a figure echoed across @entity120			0
the low numbers and subsequent gaffes have led critics to accuse the policy of police commissioners , which aimed to hold forces better to account , of being a white elephant .			0
