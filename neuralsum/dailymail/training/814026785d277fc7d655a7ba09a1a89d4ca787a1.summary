by @entity1 reporter a gardener who was bed - ridden for three weeks after an injury excavating a vegetable patch has invented a double - handed spade which he claims takes the back - breaking work out of digging			1
@entity7 , 71 , came up with the odd - looking angled design after trapping his sciatic nerve while gardening last year			1
@entity7 , a former judge on tv show @entity10 , spent weeks in his workshop building and testing prototypes as soon as he could stand again			1
helping hand : inventor @entity7 shows off his double - handled spade , which is designed to take the stress out of digging ' i could n’t believe that in all the thousands of years the spade has been around , no - one had come up with a better design , ' he said			1
in contrast to the back bending and twisting involved in using a conventional spade , mr @entity7 ’ invention lets him dig in an upright standing position			1
it is made possible by double handles and a unique angled design that allows him to use his upper thigh and hip as a pivot point to lever the soil out of the ground without straining his back			2
mr @entity7 , from @entity36 in @entity37 , said : ' i know my design looks a little bit unusual but it makes gardening so much easier , especially for older people who could remain active in the garden for many more years			1
' i can dig like this all day with very little strain now that i do n’t have to do all of that bending and twisting			0
' you do still have to " dig " , pushing the spade in with the foot , but then you pull back – using the body as a fulcrum – take the upper handle , lift up , put the soil where you need it and then use the lower handle to turn the soil over and break it up			2
' it ’s just as fast at digging as a conventional spade , if not faster ! ' mother of invention : @entity7 came up with his labour - saving spade design after injuring his back digging mr @entity7 came up with the idea after he badly hurt his back while digging his vegetable patch with a conventional spade last spring			1
' i ’d dug about two rows , i went to turn and then my back went			0
it locked up and went into spasm			0
i was in agony , ' he said			0
' i ’d trapped my sciatic nerve and had to spend three weeks incapacitated , on strong painkillers			2
i was so furious it got me thinking about the spade and how it could be redesigned to stop this sort of thing happening			0
my back still has n’t fully recovered 10 months later			0
' mr @entity7 , an armour and weapons expert for the documentary series @entity80 , was an art and design lecturer before getting into tv and film work			1
he appeared in early shows of @entity10 – judging contraptions made from air compressors and old bicycles – and has worked on documentaries such as @entity91 ’s @entity90 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , the @entity96 ’s programme about female gladiators			0
he also designed weapons and armour for the movie @entity101			0
his prototype spade is built from a carbon steel blade , a tubular steel shaft and a synthetic moulded section shaped to fit comfortably against the thigh			2
step forward : an expert said the new spade design invented by mr @entity7 could be ' an important step forward to safer and less tiring digging ' the spade can be stored in two pieces and the blade attachment might easily be replaced with a fork or a weed puller			1
mr @entity7 , who has made a video of his spade in action , is now looking for a manufacturer to take his design to the next level			1
dr @entity121 , postgraduate research director at @entity122 , who has seen the video , believes the spade could be ' an important step forward to safer and less tiring digging '			1
' @entity7 ’s spade gives a clear advantage in terms of posture			1
it ’s used with a straight back , which would significantly reduce effort			0
in contrast , the bending and twisting needed to use a conventional spade creates significant postural strain which is both tiring and dangerous and carries an acknowledged risk of spinal injury , ' he said			0
dr @entity139 , @entity140 , back pain charity @entity141 , said : ' the vast majority of back pain is stress - induced like the vast majority of headache , and does not relate to any physical damage , disease or dysfunction			0
' digging with a conventional spade should not cause injury or persistent pain in healthy people			2
however , since @entity155 [ fear of movement ] is a known barrier to back pain recovery , anything that helps people get back to normal activity is better than avoiding activity altogether			0
@entity7 ’s previous small - scale inventions include a survival knife that he designed with the survival specialist @entity166 , a simple - to - use etching press for schools and colleges , and a multi-purpose wheelbarrow that is supposed to make loading and unloading easier .			2

@entity7 , 71 , came up with the design after injuring himself digging
inventor , of @entity36 in @entity37 , took weeks *perfecting* the l - shaped spade
*revolutionary* invention was an ' important step forward ' , expert said
