’ financial research group @entity75 yesterday said its index of activity in the services sector - which accounts for more than three quarters of @entity8 output - rose from 60.3 in september to 62.5 in october			1
that was the strongest reading since may 1997 , the month when @entity81 became prime minister , and well above the 50 mark that separates growth from decline			0
