it seems that risking his life as he crosses the @entity4 skyline 50 stories in the air is n't enough for daredevil @entity7 , as the tightrope walker has revealed he will complete the feat blindfolded			1
@entity7 broke the news this morning while appearing on today , shocking @entity11 when he made his big announcement			1
' why ? ' asked the morning show host			2
' i ’ll not only need incredible physical strength to complete this walk , but laser - focued concentration , ' he added			2
the daredevil performer first revealed the plan for his latest feat in an interview with outside , and it is not for the faint of heart			1
he said he will begin at the @entity21 and walk a wire strung at an uphill 15 - degree angle across the @entity18 to the @entity24			0
and 's that 's not all			0
thrill of the chase : @entity7 is seen above crossing the @entity44 , over 1,000 feet in the air then he 'll come down to ground level , walk back to @entity21 , and cross another wire to the @entity49 tower			1
it is all set to go down on november 2 , and , of course , will air as a live - tv special on @entity53			1
this setting is shockingly urban for the tightrope walker , whose last two nerve - racking feats involved him crossing the @entity44 and @entity58			1
the city also presents challenges that seem to make @entity7 a bit nervous			1
' it ’s gon na be cold			0
it ’s gon na be windy , ' he said			0
' that ’s the challenge			0
the other walks were enjoyable , peaceful			0
' seeing as those previous two ' peaceful ' walks took place 1,400 feet in the air , it is safe to say the performer has a far different definition of the word than most			1
@entity7 will be untethered for the walk , which he prefers			1
he was tethered for the @entity58 walk , but was not for his performance in the @entity44 , meaning that any slip would be fatal			0
seven members of his family have fallen to their death , most recently @entity7 ’s great - grandfather @entity81 during a 1978 walk in @entity83			2
that fear of possible death is what brings in the audiences however , says @entity7			2
