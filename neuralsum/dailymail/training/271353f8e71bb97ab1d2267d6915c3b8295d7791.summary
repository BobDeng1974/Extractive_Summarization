in yet another jab to @entity4 's @entity3 coverage , the network has been accused of manufacturing unnecessary suspense for the women 's gymnastics final - which was arguably not even close			1
the @entity8 dominated the @entity10 team , which includes 2011 world champion @entity11 , and @entity12 cruised to its first gold medal since 1996 by a five - point margin			1
it was n’t exactly as tight a match as tv viewers were led to believe			0
in fact , it was practically a runaway for the @entity8 over a @entity10 team that struggled throughout the final			1
nail in the coffin : @entity11 's floor exercuse , complete with a cringe - worthy stumble demolished any hope of @entity27 taking home gold stumble : a judge watches as @entity11 falls in the gymnastics final shock : @entity10 gymnasts and team officials react as @entity34 fell during the floor exercise what the network did not show was @entity11 's floor exercise , complete with a cringe - worthy stumble that demolished any hope of @entity27 taking home gold			1
the botched landing during @entity11 's floor exercise sparked cries of despair among her teammates and and led the squad to walk away in tears			1
as @entity50 ’s @entity49 explained : ' @entity4 also cleverly avoided showing the standings upon skipping ahead to the @entity8 rotation , with [ commentator ] @entity54 asking whether the @entity8 " can deliver a knockout blow " and casting doubt upon @entity8 chances by showing @entity58 missing a tumble landing during warmups			2
' @entity50 ’s story included a @entity63 video that showed the @entity34 's full performance			0
tears : @entity11 could not control her emotions as she waited to hear her score after the floor exercise second place : @entity27 wound up taking the silver medal after being dominated by the @entity8 @entity27 's woes began on the balance beam , as @entity73 swayed and wobbled during her performance and @entity75 almost stepped on the judges on her dismount			1
' we did everything we could , ' @entity75 said			0
with the @entity8 leading before the floor exercise - the final event - @entity27 needed two things to happen : a ) the @entity8 needed to make mistakes and b ) @entity27 had to be flawless			1
unfortunately for @entity27 , the opposite occurred			0
the @entity8 , led by team captain @entity58 was at her best on the floor , graceful in her tumbles and sticking the final landing			2
dominance : @entity8 gymnast @entity91 , second left , lifts up the hand of teammate @entity58 , as they celebrate along with @entity94 and @entity95 after being declared gold medal winners pride : @entity12 stands at the centre of the @entity100 pedestal with silver medallists @entity27 , left , and bronze medallists @entity103 , right on the @entity10 side , the team was marred by a stumble by @entity107 on the floor before 2011 @entity110 champion @entity11 topped a near - flawless performance by landing the dismount on her knees			1
the fall was the final mishap that destroyed @entity27 's hopes for gold , as the @entity8 finished five points ahead of them , an astonishing victory by @entity8 gymnasts @entity94 , @entity91 , @entity122 , @entity95 , and @entity123			1
while some teenagers might have found the pressure tough to bear on the world stage , the @entity8 revelled in it			2
inconsolable : @entity11 's coaches tried to comfort her after she fell during her floor exercise close - up : two judges looked on in awe as @entity94 completed her vault ' we knew we could do it			1
we just had to pull out all the stops , ' said @entity123			0
their achievement earned the ' @entity140 ' their place in history , and even president @entity143 congratulated the five members of the @entity8 women 's gymnastics team on wednesday on their @entity100 victory - and he had some questions about just how they managed to pull off their gold medal performances			1
' i told these young ladies as i was congratulating them , how do you not bust your head every time you 're on that little balance beam ? ' @entity143 said			0
' i could n't walk across that balance beam			0
' @entity143 telephoned the gymnastics team from @entity157 as he traveled from @entity158 to @entity159 for campaign events			0

@entity4 's broadcast of the @entity187 games has come under intense scrutiny , which has been exacerbated due to @entity167 , which viewers have used as a soap box to gripe about the coverage			2
the microblogging site erupted in protests earlier this week following a promo that showed @entity8 swimmer @entity195 with her gold medal - moments before the network aired the dramatic race in which she won it			2

' @entity214 ' account was later reinstated			0
there was also outrage over @entity4 's decision to cut a tribute for the victims of the @entity187 2005 terrorist bombings from its @entity231 coverage on friday			0
the network said it did not air the tribute because it was n't tailored for the @entity8 audience - and aired a @entity235 interview with iconic swimmer @entity236 instead .			0
