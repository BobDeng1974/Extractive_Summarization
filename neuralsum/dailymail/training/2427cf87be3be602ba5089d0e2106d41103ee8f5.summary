by @entity0 today 35,000 runners will line up at the start of the @entity3			1
and i can guarantee that for most of them , the hardest road wo n’t be the one ahead ( and that wo n’t be easy ) but the one that got them there			1
training to run 26½ miles is no mean feat. i should know			1
in 2012 , i achieved a personal best time of two hours 54 minutes – quite an accomplishment considering that i started as a keen amateur jogger a decade ago , in my early 30s			1
i ’m not running this year and last year i missed the big race as i ’d just given birth to my daughter , @entity18			1
and as a busy mother of two – my son @entity20 is seven – fitting in exercise can be a squeeze			1
but i ’m already training to run the marathon again next year			1
@entity0 is already training for next year 's @entity3			1
here she tells readers how to get fit for the big day , while smiling at the same time fortunately we now know that endless long runs are not the best way to prepare for a marathon			1
research shows that short bursts of intense exercise – known as high - intensity interval training ( @entity33 ) – are a better way to get in shape for endurance running than pounding the pavements or treadmill for hours			1
a long weekly run of 5km is still a priority , but it ’s preferable to split the session into a series of shorter , pacier jogs with rests			1
of course , if you love to run , you do n’t have to give up			1
instead , intersperse a 40 - minute jog or brisk walk with these exercises , all of which can be done using improvised equipment – such as a log , fence or park bench			1
each takes just a minute or so , so the whole thing feels fresh			1
did i mention it ’s fun ? pushing yourself to the limit can be hard – but all the leaping , hopping and bouncing makes me break out in a huge grin			1
athletes on the @entity65 after finishing the marathon			1
today , more than 35,000 runners will fill @entity69 's streets the programme if you ’re training from scratch – whether for a 5k fun run or a full marathon – take at least 12 weeks to prepare			1
aim for three or more sessions a week			1
at least two should be @entity33 sessions , in which you run or walk briskly for five minutes , followed by one @entity33 exercise – done quickly , aiming to take not much more than three minutes , with no rests between sets – and then repeat			1
the whole routine will take about 50 minutes			1
the focus is on leg exercises , although the upper body is n’t neglected – arms matter for a good running technique			1
if you ’re pushed for time , jog for five minutes , then just do the exercises			1
reserve one session a week for longer runs			1
instead of 5km in one go , try a kilometre at your best pace followed by a two to three - minute rest , then repeat five times			1
box jumps @entity97 : jumping over a tree trunk might sound like a game , but it uses almost every muscle in the body			1
if you ca n’t find a fallen tree , try jumping up on to a park bench , or start small by using the front door step – but step down carefully so as to protect the ankle			1
jumping over a tree trunk uses almost every muscle in your body how : stand with your feet shoulder - width apart , close to the obstacle you think you can either completely jump over or jump up on to			1
squat so your thighs are almost at right angles to your calves			1
use your arms to start momentum , swinging them forward then back , and push off as hard as you can with both feet to propel yourself over / on to the ‘ box ’			1
try to land as quietly as you can			1
either step down or turn around and repeat			1
do : 3 sets of 15 to 20 bunny hops @entity97 : another one that might feel a bit silly , in a good way			1
you will need a bench without a back – or that trusty log , if you can find one			2
this could n’t be simpler but is a fantastic all - over body workout , and rather exhausting when you do a lot of them ! @entity0 illustrates the bunny hops which is a ' rather exhausting ' all - body workout how : stand on one side of the bench , bending over with your hands on it , with your knees slightly bent			1
jump both legs over the bench together			2
land on the other side			2
that ’s one rep. try to keep your weight over your chest so your feet can land light and springy each time			2
focus on keeping your abdominals pulled in throughout			2
do : 3 sets of 30 to 50 @entity157 @entity97 : dips work the backs of the arms and will help tone them up			2
a bench or that trusty log is needed for this one			2
tricep dips : work the backs of the arms and will hope tone them up how : sit up straight on the long edge of the bench or log , legs slightly extended , feet flat on the ground			2
place your hands palms down , fingertips just curled over the edge , on both sides of the bench just outside your hips			2
without moving your feet , bring your bottom forward , off the bench			2
when your elbows form 90 - degree angles , push yourself back up to starting position			2
if you want to make this easier , bring your feet closer to your body			2
do : 3 sets of 10 @entity189 - @entity188 @entity97 : to keep your core strong			2
when you are struggling in a run and you want to sprint to the finish , your upper body will help you do this			2
how : on the ground in plank position , set your hands at a distance slightly wider than shoulder - width apart			2
angle your hand in a way that feels comfortable			2
press - ups : to keep your core strong			0
when you are struggling in a run and you want to spring to the finish your upper body will help you do this the wider apart your feet , the more stable you ’ll be			0
if it ’s too difficult , you can rest on your knees			0
your bottom should n’t be sticking way up in the air or sagging			0
you should be looking slightly forward not down – your chin should touch the floor first			0
at the top of a push - up , your arms should be straight			0
steadily lower your body until your elbows are at a 90 - degree angle			0
at the lowest point , pause slightly then push fast and with energy back up to the start			0
do : 3 sets of 10 one leg @entity225 @entity97 : the fallen log will again become your ‘ gym bench ’ – and this move is a great way to work the hip flexors , bottom and backs of legs , and improve balance			0
how : stand about 3ft from the bench , facing away from it , feet shoulder width apart , hands on hips			0
one leg split squats : this move is a great way to work the hip flexors , bottom and backs of legs move one foot back so that your toe is resting on the bench			0
your other foot should be stationary , a little in front of your body – keep your head up to stay balanced			0
make sure your back is straight and chest proud			0
inhale , slowly lower your leg until your thigh is parallel to the floor			0
your knee should be over your toes			0
leading with the chest and hips , elevate your leg back to the start as you exhale			0
halfway through , switch legs			0
do : 3 sets of 10 to 20 suspended single leg @entity225 @entity97 : this targets the thighs , but also the upper body and core			0
you need a suspension trainer – an adjustable nylon strap with hand grips			0
you can get a simple one for about £ 60			0
how : @entity273 suspension trainer around fence or tree ( strong enough to partly support your weight ) so straps are running upward at slightly more than 45 degrees			0
suspended single leg squats : this targets the thighs , but also the upper body and core			0
you need a suspension trainer ¿ an adjustable nylon strap with hand grips hold handles with a light grip , somewhere between horizontal and vertical			0
feet should be about shoulder - width apart			0
lift a leg up , pointed in front of the body			0
maintain alignment and distribute weight evenly through the middle of the grounded foot			0
inhale and squat on one leg ( keeping opposite leg from the floor ) , until squatting leg is parallel to the ground			0
push up to the start and repeat			0
switch legs halfway through set			0
do : 1 set of 10 to 2 @entity307 for sprint intervals , you should aim to run as fast as you can for between 15 and 30 seconds , then slow down to a very gentle jog for a minute , and repeat			0
the first couple of times , you might feel exhausted after about four or five intervals , but aim to build up to eight sprints			0
the next time you go out on a steady run you will be amazed how you feel much more comfortable in your usual pace			0
the fitter you become , the faster you will recover			0
@entity318 : you should aim to run as fast as you can for 15 - 30 seconds			0
