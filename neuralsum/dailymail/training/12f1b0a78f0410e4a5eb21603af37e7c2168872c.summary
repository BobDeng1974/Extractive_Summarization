by @entity0 bee species that were teetering on the verge of extinction in the @entity4 have made a remarkable recovery , much to the delight of conservationists			2
a project that began as an attempt to re-introduce one species of extinct bee to @entity4 has sparked a comeback by five more varieties whose numbers had dwindled alarmingly in recent decades			2
conservationists say the speed of their recovery suggests that the bees can in fact cope with some pesticide use by farmers , if they have wild flowers to feed on and a place to live			1
thriving : a project to reintroduce the short - haired bumblebee to @entity4 has sparked a comeback by five more bee varieties dr @entity29 , of the @entity30 , said : ' it ’s not a doom and gloom scenario			1
we can actually reverse this trend			0
' pesticides have been blamed for killing off many bumblebees , as has the loss of 97per cent of the @entity4 's wild flower meadows since the 1930s due to agricultural intensification and urbanisation			1
bees are vital for the environment as they pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth £ 560m a year to the @entity4 economy			2
seven of the country 's 25 bumblebee species are now considered threatened enough to be in the @entity51			1
however , five of these , the brown - banded carder , moss carder , red - shanked carder , large garden and shrill carder , have been found in increasing numbers at the project in @entity60 , which aimed to reintroduce short - haired bumblebee queens to the @entity4			1
revival : several species of carder bee have been found in increasing numbers at the project base near @entity66 , @entity60 a-buzz : bees are vital for the environment as they pollinate fruit and vegetable plants - making them worth £ 560m a year to the @entity4 economy as a result of the scheme the endangered queens , which were brought to the @entity4 from @entity76 , nested in the country this autumn for the first time in 25 years			1
conservationists began the project in 2009 by encouraging wild flowers to grow on a 20 - hectare plot near @entity66 in @entity60			0
they have now expanded this prime bee habitat across more than 800 hectares in @entity60 and @entity84			0
the programme has attracted attention in @entity87 , where officials believe the researchers may have found a way to halt bumblebee decline across @entity92			0
@entity93 , a conservation officer in northern @entity87 , said its ' results are good ' , and added that they were planning to study bumblebees there shortly			0
@entity99 , a @entity100 farmer who has been taking part in the project , said : ' if we do n’t have bumblebees , we wo n’t have pollination			0
' if we do n’t have pollination , you wo n’t have food for the country			0
