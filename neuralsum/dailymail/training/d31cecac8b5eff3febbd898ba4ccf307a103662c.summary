by @entity0 last updated at 6:52 pm on 10th july 2011 theirs is more than just your average boy - meets - girl story			2
it 's a @entity5 love story , with a very modern twist			1
@entity7 , 58 , and his wife @entity8 , 56 , said they know the secret to a happy and successful marriage - live in separate homes			1
for the first four years of wedded bliss the quirky couple - who met online - lived apart , she in @entity16 and he in west 23rd street in @entity18			1
secret : @entity8 said she believes marriage is a state of mind and does n't see why two people have to live together force : @entity7 said he did n't want to both get married and lived together but the recession drove them to cohabit @entity7 - a managing editor at a trade publication - said : ' we consider seventh avenue a long hallway between our two domiciles			1
' but hard times hit as it did with many @entity5 and when @entity7 's boss raised his rent to $ 1,800 a month , the couple did the unthinkable - they moved in together			1
@entity7 said : ' it was really a financial move to cohabit			1
now we are transitioning into real - time marriage			2
' speaking about living together - or not living together - @entity7 said it was an arrangement they were both comfortable with			0
he said : ' i told her i could handle getting married and living together , just not both			0
and to my relief she said , " ok let 's get married and keep our own places "			0
that 's what i was hoping for			0
' @entity49 said : ' when you 're young you think , " oh , we ’re in love , " all that			0
but when you get older , you say , " you know , i love you , but i need my space "			0
' expensive : @entity7 leaves his spacious apartment on west 23rd street because the rent was increased to $ 1,800 tight squeeze : there is barely room for @entity8 's stuff in her @entity16 apartment nevermind her husbands when @entity7 moved into @entity49 's tiny one - bedroom @entity16 apartment , where she has been for 31 years , even then they were n't prepared to fully live together			1
instead of embracing cohabitation , the couple drew up battle lines , put up invisible walls and lay down a set of ground rules			2
according to the @entity76 , there was no crossing into each other 's space without permission , she had her own bedroom - where she generously said he could sleep at weekends - and he slept in a sofa bed in the living room			0
the end ? : the couple are still blissfully in love after four years of marriage and living apart but will cohabiting change that ? they have their own newspaper and magazine subscriptions , ' watch their own tv shows from their own space and even have a shower rota			1
the kitchen - which also hosts the apartment 's only shower - is the only place that is allowed for both couples any time of the day or night			2
@entity49 - a retired high - school teacher who now runs her home - made jewellery business - believes that not living together was the secret to their happy marriage			1
' getting married is a state of mind , i do n't see why we have to live together			0
i do n't need to see him brush his teeth , ' she told the @entity76			0
' it 's bad enough i see him brush his hair			0
' i do n’t know where this idea came from that you always have to be in the middle of whatever the other person is doing			0
' alarmingly , she said when she told her ex-husband they were now living together he said : ' i give it four months			2
' the couple are featured in a documentary titled ' two 's a crowd ' which will have its @entity5 premiere at the @entity131 on july 21 .			1
