by @entity0 published : 08:21 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 08:48 est , 13 november 2012 some people would pay thousands to eat lunch with a spectacular view , but this crafty leopard takes her meals to another level			2
these incredible pictures show the big cat having a snack while up a tree in south - western @entity13 and were taken by @entity15 - based photographer @entity14			1
ms @entity14 had to patiently wait nearly two hours before the female leopard revealed herself and led her safari group to the secret lunch spot			1
feat : with incredible agility and strength , this leopard dragged its kill up a tree to eat tasty : the animal made the most of its peaceful vantage point in the tree to have a relaxed bite to eat wild and free : the savannah in south - west @entity13 is famous for its diverse population ms @entity14 said : ' we were driving around the @entity33 early one morning when we saw about 25 vehicles around some thick scrub			1
' we knew it had to be something exciting so we drove over to find out that there was a leopard in the area			2
' after about 90 minutes , one by one each vehicle left because this leopard was nowhere in sight anymore			2
' as they were each pulling away my guide spotted this female leopard well hidden in this thick brush			2
' it finally got down to about three vehicles , when she finally decided to come out in the open			0
' she proceeded to walk out into the wide open savannah plains , taking her time , and obviously knew where she wanted to go			0
protective : the leopard had left its prey high up the tree earlier in the day to keep it safe hungry mouths : experts believe the leopard was planning to take the gazelle home to share with the family unforgettable : ms @entity14 said the experience in the @entity33 would stay with her for life guarded : the female leopard made those following her wait for two hours before leading them to her meal ' we followed close behind her and she seemed relaxed and disinterested in us driving along with her			1
' ms @entity14 followed the predator for a while before seeing the leopard stop suddenly and look around a lone tree before climbing up at impressive speed			1
she said : ' we were so focused on looking at her that we did not notice that there was a @entity79 's gazelle body hanging near the top of this tree			1
' this was a kill that she must have put up there the night before			0
she sat with it a few minutes , then came back down the tree			1
' it was funny because she just kind of lounged around the tree , sitting in the sun , then the shade , and then taking a little nap on the ground near the tree			1
' the @entity33 is a large reserve named after the @entity33 people , the traditional inhabitants of the area			0
fascinating sight : ms @entity14 noticed the leopard because roughly 25 tourist vehicles were gathered around it patience rewarded : one by one , the safari groups departed , until only the few remaining got to see the creature run its intriguing errand @entity103 : the female ate some of the gazelle herself before apparently taking it back to her two cubs it is famous for an exceptional population of lions , leopards and cheetahs , game , and the annual migration of zebra , @entity79 's gazelle , and wildebeest to and from the @entity119 every year from july to october , known as the @entity119			1
leopards live mainly in grasslands , woodlands , and river forests			0
they are usually associated with savannah and rainforest , but are exceptionally adaptable - in the @entity127 far east , they inhabit temperate forests where winter temperatures reach a low of -25c			0
ms @entity14 believes that the leopard was saving most of the kill for her cubs			0
she said : ' my guide said he believed that she had two small cubs in that area and was bringing her kill to share with them			0
' this was a morning i will never forget , and once again proving that you need to sit and be patient , especially when it comes to seeing a leopard in the wild			0
' we spent about four hours waiting for her to come out and watching her on this journey			2
i could not think of a better way to spend a morning in the @entity33			0

photographer waited for two hours before predator led her to tree where it had *stashed* a @entity79 's gazelle
