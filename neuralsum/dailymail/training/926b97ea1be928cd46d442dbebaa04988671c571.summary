@entity0 has warned his @entity2 team - mates there is plenty more to @entity5 than his farcical @entity7 stint suggested			1
@entity9 's side are flying high at the top of @entity11 having won their second @entity13 match in succession on saturday , a 2 - 0 success over the @entity16 , but a tougher test awaits when they face top seeds @entity19 on tuesday night			1
the trip to @entity21 is a return to familiar territory for @entity0 , who spent two years at @entity24 before leaving this summer			1
@entity2 goalkeeper @entity0 spent two years alongside @entity5 at @entity24 the 37 - year - old goalkeeper , who made a brilliant penalty save to keep a clean sheet against the @entity28 , will be coming up against a handful of former team - mates , including @entity5			1
the striker arrived at @entity32 with an Â£ 11million price tag in january and the task of saving @entity7 from @entity36 relegation			0
instead , having struggled with injury , he fell short of @entity39 's high physical standards and was largely treated as a pariah , starting just once and featuring from the bench twice more			0
he was packed back off to @entity24 on loan in august and announced his return with the winning goal in a @entity46 tie against @entity47			2
it is that @entity5 that @entity0 knows best , not the @entity7 misfit			1
" he 's a quality player , " said the veteran shot stopper			0
@entity5 ( right ) had a difficult spell at @entity7 this year and could not adapt to the regime of @entity39 " i know what he 's like , he is a player who can score goals from anywhere , he could pop up in the first minute or last minute and score a goal against us			2
" he needs good players around him , and when he was at @entity24 he had good players around him and he scored goals in the league and in the @entity46 , which proved how good he was			2
" but he went to @entity7 and it was very difficult because they were in a bad situation when he moved over and he got injured as well before he went			0
he was out for two months with a knee injury but he 's back now and he 's already scored a goal in the @entity46			0
" @entity0 also has plenty of insight into the mentality of the @entity19 fans and believes @entity2 could take advantage of their fickle nature with a strong start			1
" i know what fans in @entity19 are like and hopefully if we can keep them quiet they might turn on their players ... the @entity19 fans can do that , " he said			2
" they are very passionate especially about their sports ; football , basketball water polo , they live for their sports and if the players do n't turn it on on tuesday night they could turn on them			0
" they could go either way , they could go crazy or they could be quiet , it depends on the game			0
" @entity0 left @entity19 with a heavy heart but knew he had to look elsewhere when a change in management saw him shunted to third choice at @entity24			1
an offer was on the table to join the coaching staff but instead he decided to return to @entity99 football , where he is now with @entity100 , to keep his international ambitions alive			0
" i enjoyed myself in @entity19 , two and a half years at a great club , " he said			1
" i 'm looking forward to going back because i had great times there and i was disappointed to leave with the family settled but i needed to play more football so i could keep playing for @entity2			0
