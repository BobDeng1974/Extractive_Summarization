@entity1 manager @entity0 is keen for @entity2 to protect his teenage prodigy @entity3 for the upcoming @entity5 qualifiers against @entity6 and @entity7			1
@entity0 has already lost two of his players @entity10 and @entity20 to injuries sustained on international duty and does not see the need for @entity3 , the rising star of @entity16 football , to play the full 180 minutes against two nations @entity19 ’s men can be expected to beat comfortably			1
the @entity1 manager was critical of the way @entity2 handled @entity10 during the last international break when the striker returned to @entity25 with a thigh injury			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 is keen to protect his teenage prodigy @entity3 choosing his words carefully so he could not be accused of telling @entity19 which team to pick , @entity0 said about @entity3 : ‘ it is easy to say he is 19 and can play every day of the week but it does n’t work like that			1
‘ human beings do n’t work like that			0
it is nature there will come periods when they need the rest			0
i would think that @entity19 and his staff would have a look at things			0
‘ he ’ll want to ensure the games are won but i am sure it [ protecting players ] will be an objective when you are winning a game comfortably			0
‘ we lost the young boy @entity20 when @entity53 under - 21s were 6 - 0 up against @entity54 on an awful pitch			2
‘ the @entity2 manager , the @entity2 staff , they get paid their salary , they make the decisions			2
i think they are clever enough to hopefully work with the clubs and they can get success from having fit players			0
‘ i am not here to tell the @entity2 staff how to do their job			2
it is one of the biggest jobs as a manager , maximising the available talent , managing them on and off the field			0
it is probably something i am sure will happen			0
’ @entity3 has gained a big international reputation since his performances at the @entity75 and was followed everywhere on the pitch during @entity1 ’s @entity78 win against @entity79 – something he can expect to happen again when the @entity82 campaign continues in @entity83 on wednesday night			1
@entity0 is determined the youngster does not fall victim to burn - out or foul play , hence fears over the limited but physical defenders of @entity7 , whom @entity2 face at @entity90 on october 9 , three days before the game in @entity6			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 was critical of the way @entity2 handled @entity10 ‘ it is pretty clear from the games this season , and i saw it in pre-season , that he sometimes has two and three men around him			1
is it affecting his performances ? not really			0
he has been brilliant so far and he ’ll hopefully continue to keep that consistency in his game , ’ added the @entity1 boss			0
behind @entity0 ’ concerns over @entity3 ’s next get - together with @entity2 is what happened to @entity10			1
the @entity1 boss disclosed that @entity2 ’s sports science and medical team had spent three - and - a - half hours with club specialists discussing the injury record and recovery time required for each @entity114 player			2
but despite the planning , 25 - year - old @entity10 then aggravated a thigh problem during an @entity2 training session @entity0 clearly felt was unwise for him to participate in			1
@entity10 subsequently missed @entity2 ’s opening @entity5 qualifying win away to @entity119			1
@entity0 said pointedly : ‘ we put time into trying to help the associations when they want it			2
obviously , we would hope then that that could be respected			0
