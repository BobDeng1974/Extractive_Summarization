perhaps i 'd overdone it by following @entity2 sunday ? or perhaps @entity3 turned out to be like any other monday ... but arguably , deadlier			2
to the point where perhaps the most interesting move on @entity6 ' coverage of the day was @entity10 's former sidekick , @entity9 , making a move to the afternoon shift			1
with the station 's rising star @entity13 moving in the opposite direction			1
making the yellow dress her own			1
of course , i mainly blame the world of football for not splashing some rash cash to keep us all entertained as the clock ticked			2
but i also have to take some of the blame myself			2
because i got what i wished for			2
with @entity6 ' reporters acting as the unwitting , or sometimes excruciatingly witting ring masters			1
well i got what i asked for			2
and man alive is what it has been replaced with dull			0
i 'm sure their reporter @entity49 is delighted , though			0
he spent his evening in @entity53 's car park			1
and the only thing he got in his ear was a word from @entity10 and @entity13 back at @entity57			1
@entity58 presenter @entity13 with @entity10 in a picture shared on @entity60 @entity9 shared an image of her with @entity62 and @entity63 on @entity60 @entity64 shared this image of her with fellow presenter @entity65 on @entity60 but he had among the best of it			1
at least he might be asked to get out of the way so someone could move their motor			0
some reporters were left alone in dark , silent stadiums			0
their faces lit up like characters in @entity76			0
one reporter , @entity77 , was in the solemn surroundings of @entity80 's @entity79			1
at least i assume it was @entity80			0
you could see the ' h ' and @entity87 's ' behind his head			1
but was the letter he was blocking an ' e ' ? there were some worthy attempts to jazz things up			0
@entity96 's flourish pronouncing ' @entity94 ' certainly chirped @entity97 up			1
and @entity10 could n't believe his luck when he saw himself in a viral , his head transplanted to @entity101 's body for a rousing ' deadline day ' rendition of ' @entity104 '			2
perhaps a new career as @entity101 , @entity10 ? rising star @entity65 ( right ) joined @entity10 in the yellow dress for the prime time shift on deadline day @entity9 kept wearing her yellow dress after being moved to the afternoon slot but if none of this was enough to stop your deadline day flat - lining , there was , for the first time , an alternative			1
this year , @entity28 decided to go head to head with @entity6 with their own transfer window show			1
inside their arena - sized studio , around several desks and with @entity124 at the helm , an army of presenters , pundits , comics and impressionists - plus agent @entity131 and @entity132 from the business end - were all drafted in to pick their way through the last few hours of deadline day			2
although when they asked the question ' ditch the window ? ' , just half an hour into their coverage , i think the tone was immediately set as to how they were going handle their coverage			2
which was , essentially , to not really get caught up in the hysteria of it all			0
of which there was n't any , anyway			0
so probably a good call ? there was no sign of @entity49 battling abusive fans outside of @entity155 grounds in this window @entity28 's approach was much more considered , deciding instead to focus on the ramifications of it all , rather than grind away at the rumour mill too heavily			1
it was chat heavy stuff			0
indeed , at times , too much so			0
but there was some light to the shade			0
that was particularly evident at the start of their coverage when the aforementioned @entity132 must have thought he was staring into a mirror			2
and saw @entity24 staring back			1
perched at either end of @entity124 ' desk , this got very tetchy , very quickly between the blonde , bearded book ends			0
@entity176 scoffed ' it always amuses me when people have observations about who should be in a team ' when @entity24 shared his thoughts about @entity185 's best eleven			1
and he was even stroppier when @entity24 explained the tricks he 'd pulled to manoeuvre a deadline day deal to get out of @entity189			1
' you 'd have stayed and done as you were told ' , said @entity132 , before also accusing him as being the kind of player who , ' to some extent , holds clubs to ransom '			0
@entity24 flashed the shiney gnashers			1
but i would n't say was exactly smiling			0
@entity24 donned his own yellow outfit to advertise @entity28 's deadline day coverage @entity6 presenter @entity97 was prevented from getting an early cab home meanwhile back at @entity57 , @entity10 was , in time honoured tradition , also working his molars overtime			1
but his claim at around 10.45 that it was ' all go ' whistled just a little hollow through them			0
' all over ' might have been closer to the truth			0
indeed , as eleven o'clock came around and the camera focussed on the clock in the tower at @entity209 , i 'm sure even a rather bored @entity210 could only muster about eight bongs ? and if this was n't indication enough , even before the great bell had stopped its tolling , one of @entity10 's pundits was trying to make his escape from transfer deadline day			2
' not so fast , mr @entity97 ' ordered mr @entity10 as he told us @entity97 had tried to make a break for the taxi he had ordered			0
@entity223 , i know how you feel .			0

@entity33 was *surprised* by @entity6 ' use of @entity29
@entity6 presenters @entity13 and @entity9 exchanged shifts
@entity24 donned a yellow suit to advertise @entity28 's coverage
