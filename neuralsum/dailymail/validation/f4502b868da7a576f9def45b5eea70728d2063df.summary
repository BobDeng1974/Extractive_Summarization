@entity1 ’s success started like many others			1
she got up early each morning , put on a suit , waved goodbye to her supportive parents and left for work			0
the only difference was that the 28 - year - old did n’t have an office to go to , a formal job title or a boss to report to			0
keeping her ventures a secret in fear that her parents would n't approve , ms @entity1 would venture into the city each day under the guise that she was still working hard as an accountant and sit down in a cafe or the @entity20 and secretly contact wholesalers , organise marketing campaigns and find new , affordable fashion as she built her online shopping empire			1
she distributes clothing to 45 countries , has 420,000 followers on @entity40 and 464,000 friends on @entity42 , attributing her success to dominating the social media platforms			1
ms @entity1 said even though she may not have been completely honest with her parents at the start of her career , she knows they are beyond proud of her accomplishments			1
‘ at first they said ‘ i do n’t understand how you had the guts to do this ’ but in reality it was them who left everything to take their young family to @entity58 , ’ she said			2
' they quit their great jobs to work as cleaners and in factories , now that is gutsy , ’ she added			0

after spending some time pondering her future life as a corporate go - getter , she said she was left feeling unfulfilled			0
‘ i was n’t getting much out of my day to day and a uni friend said they wanted to start a business so i quit my job and blindly followed , ’ she told @entity92			2
ms @entity1 took advantage of social media saying it was the perfect marketing opportunity for someone without much capital ‘ the small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business did n’t know how to capitalise on it ' ms @entity1 ’s family , in a show of unwavering support , lent her money for the start up venture , a pop - up fashion shop in the city			1
it took some time but eventually ms @entity1 saw that the business was n't taking off and she was left with $ 50,000 of debt			1
‘ it was really devastating when my first attempt failed			0
i ’d quit my job so i could n’t really go crawling back to my old employers			0
' it was also right in the middle of the global financial crisis so i really had no other option but to continue on , ’ she said			0
being faced with the option of flight or fight , ms @entity1 secretly soldiered on in the hopes that she would have better news to give her parents soon			1
from humble beginnings : ms @entity131 worked on bended knee scrubbing out her first warehouse , right , and she put in the hard yards before getting her first office , left			0

they do n’t even use email , ’ she said			0
in a few short years ms @entity1 has managed to take her business from a dream to cold hard reality			1

ms @entity1 now has 10 employees and says she loves that she has the opportunity to have fun each and every day try and try again : ‘ so many young people have a fear of failure but having failed , i can tell you it ’s really not as bad or as scary as it seems ' ‘ so many young people have a fear of failure but having failed , i can tell you it ’s really not as bad or as scary as it seems			1
‘ it is worth the risk and you should always back yourself , ’ she added			2

’ after being brought up in a ‘ very academically focused ’ environment ms @entity131 said she was n’t once taught how to be successful if you pursue a creative career			0
ms @entity1 said she saw a gap in the online shopping market for affordable garments even after becoming a front runner in @entity58 online business ms @entity131 said she still finds it ‘ bizarre ’ to think of herself as a role model ‘ life is long and people have to stop thinking that you ca n’t spend some of that time time when you are young to investing in yourself and what makes you happy			1
’ ‘ your work life pretty much takes up the majority of your life so why not work to live instead of live to work , ’ she added			0
after taking the online shopping market by storm ms @entity131 said it was social media that catapulted her to success			1

her social media reach was only further extended each time a satisfied customer posts a picture on @entity40 and @entity42			2
‘ basically , i had no money when i started the business so i needed social media to get the brand out to our community			1
’ coming into a market where big businesses had n’t quite grasped the power of social media ms @entity1 said there was a huge marketing sector that could be taken advantage of			1
‘ it was really devastating when my first attempt failed			0
i ’d quit my job so i could n’t really go crawling back to my old employers ' ‘ the small quick and nimble can really dominate a market like that because big business did n’t know how to capitalise on it			2
