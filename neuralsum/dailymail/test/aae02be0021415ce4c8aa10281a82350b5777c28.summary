a @entity1 language teacher has been suspended in @entity2 after suggesting that panzers should invade the country again so as ' subdue unruly pupils '			1
the @entity2 also used her classes to defend @entity8 's domestic record , and his plans for overseas expansion			1
' he was a good man who built motorways and liked music , ' she is alleged to have said , before being suspended from the @entity15 college in @entity16 , west - central @entity2			1
the @entity1 language teacher suggested that tanks ( pictured is a panzer during the @entity19 ) should be used to invade @entity2 again to subdue unruly pupils hundreds of @entity1 tanks rolled into the country in may 1940 as their @entity22 led to @entity2 becoming part of the @entity25			1
yet , according to complaining parents who passed on the comment to other teachers , the woman said she hoped ' @entity1 tanks come to @entity30 to subdue unruly pupils '			1
seventeen of the 20 pupils in her class signed a petition against the teacher , and it was quickly acted on by the authorities			2
parent teacher association president , @entity37 , said : ' in my experience , this kind of procedure is extremely rare in national education			0
i have never seen it anywhere else			0
' she has since been suspended from the @entity15 college in @entity16 , west - central @entity2 ( pictured ) the teacher , who has been at the school since september , has denied any wrong doing , saying she was ' very shocked by the extent of the case '			1
references to the @entity19 are particularly sensitive in @entity2 , where a collaborationist government worked with the @entity52			2
state institutions including the @entity55 railway company and police in major cities such as @entity58 assisted in the @entity59 too			0
despite this , there are regular cases of far right sympathisers expressing support for the kind of racism and anti-semitism championed by the @entity52			0
last month , a music teacher in @entity69 was questioned by police after forcing pupils to march up and down singing a @entity25 song			2
@entity1 had been forbidden from producing and using tanks because of the @entity74			2
but under a secret program code named the ' @entity77 ' , they began developing armored military vehicles and artillery			0
the early tanks which were mostly used for training were then tested in the @entity82			0
the early @entity1 panzer force 's success was mainly down to tactical innovation rather than the quality of the vehicles			2
but many of their later tanks outclassed @entity92 armor , delivering more casualties than they took in most engagements during the @entity19			0
a parade of @entity1 tanks crossed the desert plans of @entity98 in the @entity19 in may 1941 production of the first tank , the @entity101 , began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934			1
it had been intended only as a training tank to introduce the army to armored warfare but the @entity101 i saw combat in @entity109 , @entity2 , the @entity82 and @entity110 during the @entity19			0
the army went onto to produce the @entity112 to fill the gap after the construction of medium tanks , @entity101 , fell behind schedule			0
along with the @entity101 , the ii made up the bulk of @entity1 tank forces during the invasion of @entity109 and @entity2			1
the final @entity121 , was the workhorse force during the war making up half of all @entity1 tanks			1
it was also the only @entity1 tank to remain in production for the entire war - with a total of 8,800 produced .			0
