it 's hot or not time again as @entity1 reveals what 's been making him feel warm this week and what 's been leaving him cold inside			1
what 's hot @entity5 barely a week goes by without a minute ’s silence or a round of applause at a football ground			1
there is slightly too much of it			2
in the @entity15 in the ‘ 90s , though , @entity12 revived a great institution almost on his own			1
his recent passing was marked superbly by @entity5 this week			1
former @entity5 owner sir @entity12 funeral took place on tuesday , with many paying their last respects @entity22 the @entity25 star ’s passionate condemnation of the @entity27 ’s decision to hand the @entity28 to @entity29 was brave and welcome , bettered in its eloquence only by @entity32 ’s own @entity31			1
it should be noted , though , that @entity34 , and others , live in @entity36 these days and play most of their golf on the @entity39 of @entity40			2
shown every weekend on @entity29			2
@entity22 , in action at the @entity28 , has criticised the @entity27 's decision to give the @entity28 to sky @entity43 ’s english the @entity45 manager has an admirable command of the language but on occasions listening to him can be more entertaining than watching his team play			1
this week , for example , he described @entity51 as a ' long player ' , which is some kind of record …			1
@entity43 occasional slip - up in @entity56 has provided memorable phrases @entity58 sometimes your horizons brighten without you actually doing anything			1
@entity62 have n’t played since november but in that time @entity65 , @entity63 and @entity64 have joined the queue for a place against @entity68			2
if @entity70 fails to pick them , we should all make alternative plans for the summer of 2016			2
what 's not @entity74 @entity74 is occasionally a striker for @entity75 and last week gave a rather sour interview , criticising @entity78 ’ treatment of him at @entity79			2
@entity74 was not @entity81 standard and it was @entity78 ’ job to manage him out of the club , which he did			0
@entity74 ’s job now is to play football			0
you may have noticed that he is currently injured			0
@entity74 goes down injured during @entity79 's 2 - 0 win over @entity75 last month @entity89 bottom of the @entity91 , @entity92 manager @entity89 doubtless remains a good coach but will understood now that you can only buck trends for so long , especially while selling your best players			1
eventually the ground shifts beneath every manager ’s feet and it ’s good to get out before it does			0
only the stubborn – and @entity102 – do n’t see this			0
@entity89 has seen his @entity92 side plummet to the bottom of the @entity91 the @entity105 the knives are out for @entity107 with one correspondent describing him as a ‘ novice ’ after the rugby league convert ’s modest showing for the @entity112 last weekend			1
of course he ’s a novice , which makes attempts to fast track him full tilt towards the @entity62 squad both ridiculous and desperate			0
@entity107 ( left ) has taken some criticism for his performance for the @entity112 against @entity121 @entity122 at his @entity126 book launch last autumn , football ’s greatest warrior wore a beard and cord jacket			0
he looked like a geography teacher but at least he was working			0
now – @entity130 - he ’s got time on his hands and police are investigating an alleged row with a taxi driver			0
please get another job , @entity137			0
@entity122 ( second right ) has left his job at @entity140 and was reportedly involved in a row with a taxi driver			0

@entity43 described *midfielder* @entity51 as a ' long player '
*wolves* marked the passing of former owner sir @entity12 this week
@entity89 's @entity92 are bottom of the @entity91
