the gambler eyed the cards being laid out on the baize table and murmured quietly to his attractive @entity4 companion			0
she had accompanied him , he told the staff at the @entity10 casino , purely for ' good luck '			1
but why then was she the one talking to their female dealer in @entity14 , persuading her to oblige her friend 's extreme superstitiousness with all manner of harmless little changes to the high stakes game of baccarat he was playing			2
some might have been suspicious , but casinos love the so - called ' high - rollers ' willing to gamble millions in a single session			2
and they did n't come much more high - rolling than @entity25 , regarded as the world 's greatest poker player			1
as a casino inspector paced the private room , hung not only with chandeliers and oil paintings but also a battery of security cameras , the scene one august night two years ago could have come straight from the pages of @entity49			2
especially when the couple coolly walked out at the end of two nights of gambling that had seen a staggering £ 106 million won and lost at various times			2
in the end , they had made £ 7.7 million at @entity58 's favourite card game			1
their achievement was all the more impressive because @entity61 , the version they were playing , involves no skill whatsoever			1
his arrival at @entity36 in @entity30 , @entity37 's oldest casino , the previous night had caused genuine excitement , not to mention a gleeful rubbing of hands this week , the same pair were back in @entity10 , this time in the @entity68 , for an equally high stakes game as @entity25 , an @entity70 , tried to convince a judge he had not been cheating and the casino had no right to withhold his winnings			1
indeed , @entity25 felt so confident in his case — the biggest legal battle in @entity37 casino history — that the @entity70 stunned the gambling world by admitting precisely how he did it			1
and the truth was even more ingenious — @entity82 might prefer the word ' devious ' — than anything @entity58 ever faced			0
for @entity25 , 38 , and his companion — no casual observer but one of the sharpest operators in @entity88 — were ' edge sorting '			1
that means he and @entity34 were able to ' read ' the cards by spotting imperfections on the back of them			1
crockfords and its owners , the £ 21 billion @entity95 of @entity96 , were not prepared for this when @entity25 came to play			1
he was 16 when he told his parents in @entity100 he was going to become a professional gambler			0
he developed his poker skills playing colleagues at a telemarketing firm , went on to win countless @entity106 ' bracelets ' , or championships , and is regarded as the best all - round player on the planet			2
he now lives in @entity88 , after divorcing his wife , and his life is dedicated to the game			0
so when he contacted @entity82 and told them he would like to come to @entity10 and lay seven - figure bets on its tables , the casino was keen to accommodate him			1
high - rollers can make a huge difference to a casino 's balance sheet			1
however much he won or lost , it would be good for the casino 's image to have the ' @entity25 ' on the premises			1
@entity25 was 16 when he told his parents in @entity100 he was going to become a professional gambler he asked to play in a private room with a ' @entity14 - speaking dealer because ms @entity128 does n't speak good @entity130 '			1
@entity131 was also happy to allow a range of other unusual requests			0
@entity135 players are notoriously superstitious as the game is purely down to chance he wanted to wear his ' lucky hat ' and to be able to choose a ' lucky ' pack of cards — he specified the @entity143 brand made by the @entity70 company @entity144 — that the casino would then use for the entire time he was playing there			1
this pack had to be dealt and shuffled in a ' lucky ' way			0
the idea of @entity61 is to bet on which hand of cards — the player 's or the dealer 's — adds up closest to nine			2
players first place their bets , then the cards are dealt face - up			0
each hand contains a minimum of two cards and a maximum of three			0
tens , jacks , queens and kings are all valued at zero — so sevens , eights and nines are the most important cards in the game			0
to begin with , the game was going @entity82 ' way			0
during several hours of play @entity25 made repeated requests for decks of cards to be changed			2
this continued until he found that ' lucky ' pack he wanted			0
but it was n't luck			0
ms @entity128 had finally spotted the deck of playing cards she had been looking for			0
@entity143 brand cards have a purple - coloured diamond pattern on the back			0
an expert at ' edge - sorting ' , ms @entity128 knew some of these packs have a tiny — but crucial — flaw			1
the geometrical pattern on the backs of cards is supposed to be symmetrical , but on these it was n't			0
looked at very closely , the pattern along the long edge on one side of each card is noticeably different from the long edge on the other			2
what the pair of gamblers managed to do next was crucial			0
ms @entity128 asked the dealer to rotate the ' strong ' cards — the sevens , eights and nines — by 180 degrees ' for luck ' before they were put back into the pack			0
this transferred the pattern flaw to the opposite side of the card — from the left side to the right — which meant all the ' strong ' cards had the flaw on the same side of the card , and it was a different side from that of all the other cards			0
armed with this information , ms @entity128 and mr @entity25 could tell whether the dealer was about to deal a ' strong ' card as the first card in each hand			1
all they had to do was study the back of the top card waiting in the card ' shoe ' , or dispenser , used by the dealer and @entity25 would place his bet accordingly before the game began			1
in this way , @entity25 turned the game from the dealer 's advantage to his advantage — and raised the stakes			1
betting as much as £ 150,000 a hand , he and his companion gradually started winning and winning			0
but unless anyone was aware they were carefully studying the backs of the cards rather than the front , they would have been at a loss to explain what had happened as anything other than a tremendous streak of good fortune			0
when the pair finally got up to leave , they were told it was a bank holiday the following day			0
given they would have flown back to the @entity70 by the time banks were open again , the money would be wired to @entity25 , said @entity131			1
however , the casino clearly realised something was fishy because it never sent him the money and returned only his £ 1 million stake money			2
the argument rumbled on until , in may last year @entity25 announced he would be taking legal action , saying : ' i am deeply saddened @entity82 has left me no alternative			2
over the years i have won and lost substantial sums at @entity272 and i have always honoured my commitments			0
at the time , i was given a receipt for my winnings but @entity276 subsequently withheld payment			0
' for its part , @entity82 clearly felt that @entity25 had not won the money fair and square			2
so should the casino staff have realised far earlier than they did that @entity25 's winnings were about something more than luck ? edge - sorting is just one weapon in the arsenal of so - called ' advantage players ' — who try to find legal ways of improving their odds of winning			1
but ms @entity128 has already been banned from at least one @entity70 casino for doing it there			1
@entity25 said he sees it as the professional gambler 's job to ' exploit the weaknesses ' of casinos , and try to even out the odds casinos always ensure are stacked in their favour			2
edge - sorting , @entity25 insisted in court , involves nothing more than using information available to any player simply from viewing the backs of the cards the casino chooses to use , and by making requests of the house which it is entitled to refuse			1
@entity82 , in other words , should have known better			0
sadly for @entity25 and ' advantage players ' everywhere , mr @entity316 , begged to differ			1
the judge , who admitted he has never been in a casino and sticks to bridge , commended the @entity70 on his truthfulness but ruled his actions amounted to ' cheating for the purposes of civil law '			1
@entity25 will not get his winnings and will have to pay costs			1
worse , the verdict wo n't help him in another pending legal suit , this time in the @entity70 the @entity328 casino in @entity329 is demanding back $ 9.6 million that it says @entity25 won from it in the same circumstances			1
@entity25 is estimated to have won $ 100 million from poker — entirely legitimately — and says he is most upset about being labelled a ' cheat '			2
such a reputation is ' death ' in his world , he told the @entity68			0
but professional gamblers across the world made clear yesterday they believe he was hard done by and that anyone who tries to level the odds against an unscrupulous casino industry deserves praise			0
even @entity346 star @entity345 , another keen ' advantage player ' , railed against casinos this month after a @entity88 casino banned him for ' card - counting ' , in which players mentally keep a record of cards that have been played so they have a good idea of what cards will appear next			1
one feels sure 007 would never have stooped so low as counting cards or edge - sorting			1
indeed , in the novel @entity361 , his boss @entity360 asks him to come to his club , blades , and work out how the evil millionaire @entity365 is cheating at cards			0
sure enough , he cracks it before the evening is out			0
perhaps @entity131 should have called for @entity58 to run the rule over @entity25 — if it had , this sensational court case might never have taken place .			2

@entity25 tried to sue @entity10 casino @entity373 for his £ 7.7m ' winnings '
@entity70 played @entity61 , a form of baccarat at @entity379 in 2012
he used technique of ' edge - sorting ' , giving *customer* ' first card advantage '
claimed @entity34 accompanied him purely for ' good luck '
