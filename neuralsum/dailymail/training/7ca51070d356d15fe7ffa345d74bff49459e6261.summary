and it seems that chimpanzees chose their friends in the same way as us too			2
scientists from universities in @entity11 and @entity12 found that , like us , chimpanzees tend to partner up those they have the most in common with			1
the researchers findings , published in the scientific journal @entity17 , reveal that chimps choose their friends based on their behavioural and emotional states			0
i wan na be like you : chimpanzees make friends according to shared personality traits much like humans the scientists observed almost 40 primates in two zoos , monitoring who they formed bonds with , who they tended to sit with and what sort of personalities they had			1
the results suggest that more outgoing friendly chimps tended to make friends with similarly outgoing chimps , while less sociable chimps tended to stick together			0
best of friends : the results suggest that more outgoing friendly chimps tended to make friends with similarly outgoing chimps , while less sociable chimps tended to stick together			0
the finding mirrors the known ' similarity effect ' in humans			1
@entity46 , from the @entity12 , said : ' we found that , especially among unrelated friends , the most sociable and bold individuals preferred the company of other highly sociable and bold individuals , whereas shy and less sociable ones spent time with other similarly aloof and shy chimpanzees			1
' @entity54 of the @entity55 told @entity56 : ' the groups consisted of many males and females , and individuals formed cooperative friendships			0
' our results suggest that the preference to form these friendships with individuals much like oneself was present in the ancestor of chimpanzees and humans			1
' previous studies on other primates such as baboons saw similar results			0
earlier this year , scientists discovered more about why chimpanzees strike up such close , yet non-sexual , bonds with other non-related chimps			2
the team of international researchers found that increased levels of the hormone oxytocin played an intrinsic role in non-kin co-operation .			0

scientists from @entity11 and @entity12 studied almost 40 chimpanzees
results mirror the ' similarity effect ' which *attracts* humans to one another
