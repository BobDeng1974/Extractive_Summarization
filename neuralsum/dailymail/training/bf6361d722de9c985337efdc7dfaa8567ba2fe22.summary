@entity0 last night joined those demanding an explanation over the missing dossier detailing claims of a @entity6 paedophile ring			2
the former @entity8 cabinet minister spoke out as the clamour grew for a full - scale inquiry into historical child abuse			1
more than 130 @entity12 are now calling for an investigation into allegations that have left former home secretary @entity15 facing questions over his handling of the dossier			1
pressure : former @entity8 cabinet minister @entity0 is demanding an explanation from @entity15 over the missing dossier which detailed allegations of a paedophile network within @entity23 and @entity24 @entity15 has confirmed he received a ‘ substantial bundle of papers ’ from mp @entity25 in 1983 – which detailed allegations of a paedophile network within @entity23 and @entity24 – and passed them to his officials for investigation			1
but amid claims of an @entity36 cover - up , the @entity33 admits the dossier was either lost or destroyed			1
@entity0 , a fellow member of @entity39 ’s @entity38 in the 1980s , said yesterday : ‘ he should deal with the accusations which have been made			2
people will then have to assess for themselves			0
’ asked whether he thought @entity15 had dealt with the dossier in a proper manner , he said : ‘ it would depend on the relationship he had with his officials and also what he told them			1
i do n’t know whether he said , “ @entity52 you should go away and look at this stuff ” , or whether he said , “ this is nonsense , go and bin it ”			0
’ lord @entity15 had said he could not remember receiving the dossier from mr @entity25 but on wednesday released a statement confirming he had been given it , asked officials to look into the claims and could not remember hearing any more about it			1
however , a 2013 @entity33 review revealed that he had written to mr @entity25 in 1984 saying the dossier had been handed to police			1
lord @entity15 then released a second statement saying he had only just been made aware of the review , which proved that appropriate action had been taken			1
@entity67 demanded an investigation into the way the @entity33 handled the evidence in mr @entity25 ’s dossier			1
shadow home secretary @entity72 said the 2013 @entity33 review was carried out by two officials and took only four weeks			1
‘ this is not good enough , ’ she said			0
‘ the lack of proper answers from the @entity33 is just increasing the confusion			1
’ document : @entity15 has confirmed he received a ‘ substantial bundle of papers ’ from mp @entity25 in 1983 among at least 133 mps who have added their names to calls for an inquiry are more than a dozen @entity85 , in defiance of their leader @entity87 , who said the abuse claims were ‘ stomach - churning ’ but that police should be left to investigate them			1
@entity67 ’s @entity91 , one of @entity93 ’s key lieutenants , said : ‘ the home secretary should step in now , in the light of several reports , and establish an overarching inquiry led by child protection experts to draw together the fragmented investigations so we can make sure vulnerable young people are listened to and better protected			1
’ former children ’s minister @entity102 said he would consider , if necessary , using parliamentary privilege to name high - profile people accused of child abuse			1
@entity67 mp @entity106 said it looked bad that there were independent inquiries into historic child abuse at the @entity111 and the @entity112 but that one for @entity6 was being denied			2
mr @entity25 , who died in 1995 , told his family the dossier details would ‘ blow the lid off ’ the lives of powerful and famous child abusers , his son said			1
@entity120 told the @entity111 the @entity8 mp would have been ‘ hugely angered ’ that the allegations had not been properly investigated			1
a child abuse campaigner who worked closely with mr @entity25 said the missing dossier could have toppled the government of the day			1
@entity126 , who founded the charity @entity127 in the 1980s , would not reveal the names of the alleged @entity6 paedophiles she believes were in the file			0
but she claimed some belonged to mrs @entity39 ’s government – and called on @entity132 to help end the cover - up			1
‘ this file will never see the light of day because it could have brought a government down			0
it will have been shredded and burned , ’ she said			0
@entity137 , the @entity139 home affairs select committee chairman , said he would not call @entity15 to give evidence , adding : ‘ people should n’t look for conspiracies			1
’ but @entity67 mp @entity145 , who helped expose the full extent of @entity148 ’s paedophile attacks in a book serialised by the @entity150 , said : ‘ what has emerged from tuesday ’s select committee hearing is that @entity15 has questions to answer about what happened to the @entity25 dossier			1
‘ the muddled statements issued by @entity15 have shed little light on this			1
instead of clearing up this issue , they ’ve generated more questions about where the dossier is and what he knows about the wider issue of establishment paedophile networks			2
’ why i 'm ready to name names , by former children 's minister @entity102 fears : former children 's minister @entity102 says the continuing allegations is undermining public confidence in children 's safety every week seems to bring some horrific new story about historical child abuse			1
the avalanche of allegations is confusing and frightening , and this latest story undermines public confidence in our children ’s safety even further			2
after a major dossier concerning child sex abuse was handed to the home secretary @entity15 in 1983 by one of his own mps , the files which named suspected paedophiles disappeared without trace			1
no one knows whether this was a criminal cover - up or incompetence , but conspiracy theories that followed were inevitable			0
along with scores of my colleagues in the @entity196 , i believe there is only one way to quell the nationwide fears over our children and to ensure that the perpetrators of sick crimes are brought to justice , even if the offences occurred decades ago			0
there must be a full parliamentary inquiry			2
already 130 @entity12 have signed up to this			0
the government is resisting us — this afternoon , i received a letter from home secretary @entity212 informing us that she is ‘ not minded ’ to set up the inquiry , although she says she is not ruling anything out			1
an overarching inquiry means a co-ordinated examination of the facts			0
it must be a commission of respected figures from the legal system , @entity23 , social services and children ’s charities ; an independent inquiry with the power to demand evidence and summon witnesses			0
it would have an overview of all the historical cases of child sex abuse going back to the 1960s			0
an inquiry must address four main issues : like many in @entity6 , i was gravely concerned by the news the dossier compiled by @entity8 mp @entity25 , who spent his career fighting child abuse , had been lost			1
inevitably there is conjecture that someone deliberately lost it or hushed it up			0
who did this ? were they politicians , civil servants , or police complicit in a cover - up ? it could be mere incompetence			2
no one knows , and it is gravely damaging to both the police and @entity23 that we ca n’t get to the facts			0
some people say we should not dig under these stones , for fear of what we might find			0
this issue is not going to go away : we can not reassure people by saying we will not investigate the past			0
transparency is the only way to restore public confidence			0
we have one major advantage in our fight to force a public inquiry			2
since these stories started coming out , a lot of victims have come forward			2
there were 500 victims of @entity277 alone , some of whom had gone to the police before and been dismissed			2
these people have not had their stories heard			0
an inquiry will unearth first - hand evidence from people			2
how long it will take before the government is dragged , kicking and screaming , to agree to an inquiry , i do n’t know			0
i know @entity132 has a deep interest in combating the cancer of child abuse			0
but if he does n’t act quickly , there is a risk that this campaign will become party political and the truth will be swamped under a barrage of mudslinging			0
there will be those who will want to know why i and my colleagues do not use parliamentary privilege to name and shame suspected paedophiles in the @entity139			0
i call it the nuclear option , and it might come to that			0
but we do n’t want to compromise any police investigation			0
we need to make sure police have had every opportunity to pursue evidence			2
it is deeply frustrating , but some patience has to be exercised			0
meanwhile , we must not remain silent			0
the louder our demands for a public inquiry into all the facts , the better our chances of bringing the abusers to justice – and making sure this appalling travesty can never happen again			2

former @entity8 cabinet minister spoke as mps called for a full - scale inquiry
asked if the former home secretary had dealt with the document properly
@entity15 received a ' substantial bundle of papers ' from @entity25
the @entity33 has admitted the dossier was either lost or stolen
what exactly happened and why all those years ?
when did things start getting better , and how ?
have all *practical* steps been taken to give victims the confidence to come forward and for the police to pursue *vigorously* any remaining *offenders* , including anyone who is implicated in covering up allegations ?
and , perhaps most *importantly* of all , have all our major *childcare* institutions instituted child protection policies and practices that are fit for purpose in 2014 to deal with *modern* *technology* and savvy perpetrators – and are these *safeguards* being followed ?
