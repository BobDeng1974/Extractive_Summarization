when @entity2 took her ill mother to a matinee screening of @entity5 in @entity6 , the last thing she expected was a violent racial attack on her and her family in broad daylight			1
this 34 - year - old has spoken about the horrific attack by three men who pelted hard boiled eggs at them as they walked to their car in the late afternoon last saturday			1
' they were basically throwing missiles at us , ' @entity2 told @entity18			0
@entity2 was walking to her car with her family when they were attacked by three men from a balcony the 34 - year - old was with her sister and ill mother when they had hard boiled eggs pelted at their heads her mother suffers from @entity29 , among other health ailments and finds it difficult to leave the house due to her condition			1
' she is also a full time carer for my grandma who has been in hospital for the past month , ' @entity2 said			2
' she 's always looking after everyone else and is extremely selfless			0
' due to this , @entity2 and her sister believed that a day out at the theatre was exactly what their mother needed			1
after a seeing a matinee screening of @entity5 in @entity46 and having a late @entity48 lunch , @entity2 and her family were walking to their car on the corner of @entity53 and @entity54 street in the cbd when they heard yelling from an apartment overhead			1
' there were three men and they were saying , ' you f * * * ing @entity60 , you f * * * ing @entity61 ' over and over , ' @entity2 said			2
she noticed that the men all had @entity64 accents and thought they must be @entity64 backpackers as the term ' @entity65 ' tends to be used as an insult in the @entity64			2
this was the second time that @entity2 has been attacked in @entity6 in four years @entity2 believes that many victims of racial attack have no faith in the legal system and therefore many incidents go unreported ' they were so ignorant they could n't even get their racism correct , ' @entity2 said			1
' my sister and i started to cheekily dance to their chanting to show that it does n't really bother us			0
' it was n't until hard boiled eggs began to rain down on their heads that she became seriously concerned			1
@entity2 's immediate worry was for her sister 's brand new car , however that quickly changed when an egg flew centimetres from her head and she had to dive behind another car			2
' they threw something else - it could have been a glass bottle - and it smashed into the car next to us and knocked off the side mirror , ' she said			0
' we were certain these people were insane			0
' @entity2 attempted to take a photo of the men but became too fearful of her safety and jumped in the car			1
' this is downtown @entity6 in broad daylight and it feels like a war zone , ' she said			0
@entity2 's mother cried in the car on their way home as she believed she had brought bad luck by leaving the house			1
this is not the first racially based attack that @entity2 has experienced in @entity6			1
in 2012 on her way to work , a man put his leg between hers and forced her to the ground , spitting abuse at her while she lay on the pavement			0
@entity2 is pictured here with refugees in @entity127 , she also volunteers at the @entity128 @entity2 came to @entity129 when she was just four - years - old from @entity130 , and has lived here for most of her life ' he spat his words out with so much anger and called me a ' f * * * king terrorist , ' she said			2
' the worst part was that there were so many witnesses who did nothing and did n't even ask me if i was ok			0
' @entity2 walked into the state government building where she worked after the attack , with some of the witnesses even getting into the elevator with her while remaining silent			2
she came to @entity129 from @entity130 with her family when she was just four years old and has resided in @entity6 for most of her life			1
she now volunteers at the @entity128 typing up incident reports and has found that a lot of the victims of racial abuse are women			1
she said that many of the victims have no faith in the legal system			0
' people do n't really know what to do an what the next step is , ' she said			0
although @entity2 had memorised the apartment the men were in and their general appearance , she has not yet heard back from the police			0
