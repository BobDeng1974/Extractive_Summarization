@entity2 secretary of state @entity1 meets with @entity28 prime minister @entity27 in @entity26 at the start of her visit which will focus on the @entity13 bloodshed @entity4 today confirmed talks between world powers would take place in @entity33 on saturday , but plans have been beset by differences between the @entity2 and @entity36 on the need for political transition			1
@entity41 , facing a domestic outcry over human rights atrocities committed by the @entity13 army , has pressed for an immediate end to the violence and for president @entity44 -- never an ally of the @entity46 -- to step down			1
@entity36 , which has ties to @entity7 's military and the ruling @entity49 that stretch back to the @entity51 era , has stressed the need for @entity13 to decide their own future and has not ruled out @entity44 staying in power			1
@entity8 said she had spoken with @entity4 ' three times in the last 24 hours '			2
he ' has developed his own very concrete roadmap for political transition , he has been circulating it for comments and when i spoke to him yesterday i conveyed our support for the plan that he has put forward '			0
@entity2 secretary of state @entity1 is in @entity28 ahead of a conference set to take place in @entity33 on saturday ' we think it embodies the principles needed for any political transition in @entity7 that could lead to a peaceful , democratic and representative outcome reflecting the will of the @entity13 people			2
' @entity73 officials have previously insisted @entity8 would only attend the meeting if all parties agreed on the need for political transition in @entity7			2
' if we can meet on the basis of that roadmap , with everyone agreeing before we arrive in @entity33 that this will be the document we are endorsing by our presence , then this makes a lot of sense and we support it , ' @entity8 said today			0
' but we want to make sure any country that participates firmly supports the envoy 's transition plan and his original six point plan , ' she added			0
@entity8 said there was ' great hope that this perhaps can be a turning point in the very tragic circumstances affecting the @entity13 people '			1
if an agreement were to be reached at the meeting , ' that 's the first time that the international community will really evidence a direction that i think @entity44 will have to respond to , ' she said			0
' if ( @entity4 ) is able to pull off such a meeting and if he is able to get people there who up until now have either been on the sidelines or actively supporting or protecting the @entity44 regime , then that gives heart to the opposition			0
it also disheartens a lot of the regime insiders			0
