an @entity1 photographer , who spent nine years trying in vain to photograph @entity3 the albino whale , was finally credited for his long - running persistence on friday when he captured all 50 - tonnes of the amazing animal north of @entity7			1
these exclusive pictures of @entity3 , which @entity9 reported had been spotted in @entity10 on thursday , were taken by veteran photographer @entity11 off the coast of @entity13 in @entity14			1
the all - white @entity15 , who is migrating north for the winter from the cold waters of the @entity18 to the tropical warmth of north @entity20 , stopped off for a rare display of showmanship on his way through at @entity13			2
among the images mr @entity11 took , was a stunning panograph of the beast breaching two - to - three kilometres offshore with his body completely arched out of the water			2
it was the first time the 54 - year - old had boarded a whale watching vessel since giving up on the elusive hunt for @entity3 back in 2009			0
still getting over the shock of this amazing image , he told @entity9 today was the ' holy grail ' in his 27 - year photographic career : ' i expected to see him today , because i got the call from one of the guys at imagine cruises saying ' we 've got him '			0
but to get a full breach , it 's kind of like seeing @entity52 drop her gear on stage , you really want it to happen but you do n't expect it too			1
' mr @entity11 said the image ' eclipses ' his previous best photo of three humpback whales breaching off the coast of @entity13 back in 2004 , known as a triple breach			1
it was regarded as one of the most amazing photo 's at the time , and believed to be perhaps the only image of three humpbacks breaching in the one photo			0
he said after seeing @entity3 on friday : ' mate , i can go to the grave happy now , this is the holy grail for me			0
' captured using a lighting - fast shutter speed on his high - powered @entity74 camera , @entity11 shot the incredible panoramic picture of @entity3 's full breach from his exit out of the water right through to his re-entry			1
having toiled hard over the years , including spending six to seven days on whale watching boats during the peak migratory season , mr @entity11 said friday 's expedition made the wait for @entity3 all worthwhile			2
he said it may be something he never gets the chance to replicate again			0
photographer @entity11 said hr had waited 14 years to even see @entity3 , let alone capture the great white whale jumping from the water at the peak of his career , @entity11 would spend six or even seven days straight on the boat imagine trying to get photos of whales during the migratory season friday 's whale watching exercise was a popular day for @entity13 vessels , with all vying for a glimpse of the great white whale in action			1
@entity11 put @entity3 's sudden breach , about an hour after tailing him around , down to the departure of a competition cruise boat , @entity104 , which turned and headed for shore minutes before @entity3 came up for air			2
' he was probably coming up to see where the sound ( of the engine ) went			0
' @entity11 said the sight of @entity3 was something to marvel			0
' he is just one of those whales that has a magnificent presence about him			0
' @entity15 shares his distinguishable albino appearance with just one other white whale in the world , a @entity116			0
he was first sighted for the first time this year by a member of the public just off the coast of @entity121 in southern @entity14 on tuesday			0
he was then spotted several times again on thursday , with camera crews getting magnificent views of the 35 - year - old off the coast of @entity10			1
he was snapped and filmed breaching in waters off @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 as @entity1 's much - loved white whale continued his three - month migratory trip from @entity18 to @entity20 and back			1
@entity11 shot this image of three humpback whales breaching out of the water in @entity13 back in 2004 this photograph of a humpack whale taken by @entity11 , with a distinct marking of a @entity140 - like logo on it 's stomach , featured on the front page of the @entity9 back in 2008 photographer @entity143 shot this stunning picture of @entity3 as he surfaced near the boat of @entity10 at @entity129 in @entity10 's south on thursday afternoon @entity15 was swimming in a ' competition pod ' with four other humpback whales as they tried to jostle one another for the leading position while heading north through @entity10 @entity15 , just one of two white humpback whales in the world , breaches in the foreground with a stunning afternoon backdrop of @entity10 's @entity157 behind him			1

@entity13 photographer @entity11 said @entity15 ' has a presence ' like no other whale he has seen
he described the surreal moment he captured @entity3 out of the water like ' seeing @entity52 drop her gear on stage '
@entity11 said his panoramic image ' eclipses ' previous best whale photo of a triple breach taken in 2004
it was taken two - three kilometres off the coast of @entity13 , north of @entity7
