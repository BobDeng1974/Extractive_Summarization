by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:15 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:18 est , 20 december 2013 a family has unveiled their own postal service to rival the @entity6 with next day delivery that is half the price of a first - class stamp			1
newsagent owner @entity9 , 62 , and daughter @entity10 , 37 , set up the @entity11 this month after customers complained about the rising cost of sending letters			1
just two weeks later , they have already delivered 4,000 letters and parcels , with an average rate of 250 packages a day			1
cut - price : @entity9 , 62 , set up the new service two weeks ago , allowing people to post for 30p alternative : it was in response to complaints about the rising price of post , with first - class stamps at 60p realising anyone is legally permitted to set up their own service , the @entity28 decided to run a cut - price delivery shoppers drop off post at the family shop , @entity35 in @entity36 , @entity37 , where the @entity28 guarantee next day delivery within two - and - a - half miles for just 30p			1
and for 10p extra , the family collects letters from customers ’ homes - crushing the 60p price tag for a first class stamp			1
mrs @entity9 's husband @entity45 , 66 , delivers to half the town on his bike , cycling for up to two hours a day to ensure cards arrive on time			1
meanwhile , @entity10 drives to outlying villages , and her mother covers the centre of town when she is n't manning the shop			1
mrs @entity9 covers the centre of town in @entity36 , @entity37 , while her daughter @entity10 drives further out hand - delivery : all of the post is hand - delivered within a 2.5 - mile radius by @entity9 , her daughter and husband success : the @entity9 family have already delivered 4,000 letters since launching the service this month mrs @entity9 said : ' my daughter thought up the idea because we thought we do deliveries from the shop already - why not offer even more of a service to our customers			1
' we had heard people mentioning about the cost of the @entity6 and we felt it was something that we could possibly help out with			2
' my husband recently retired and we were looking for something to keep him busy on his bike so this seemed perfect			2
the family started the service as a way to generate more income , but it has also united the community customers are clamouring to use the service in the run up to @entity89 , as 12 cards is just £ 3.60 not £ 7.20 ' we are thrilled by how it has taken off			1
people are really grateful for the extra help - and love that it costs less			2
with the price of post steadily rising , threats of rival agencies stealing the top spot as the nation 's favourite postal service have been brewing for years			0
when the privatisation was finally announced this year , @entity104 's @entity103 poured £ 4.31 billion into @entity107 delivery firm @entity106 , to give it a boost over the flailing service			0
legally , any business can incorporate mail delivery into their work			2
the @entity28 are believed to be the first family to set up their own delivery service since the privatisation , but they predict they will not be the only ones			1
' people are so enthusiastic and it is bringing people out of their shells a bit too as it has become a bit of a talking point			0
' the reaction has been nothing but positive and we are finding that people are really eager to be loyal to a local independent business			0
' mrs @entity9 , who worked in the shop for 18 years before taking it over seven years ago , said she plans to run the service all year round - and even offers business rates			1
the service is currently turning over more than £ 75 per day			2
the profits are enough to print promotional flyers - with money left over			0
she added : ' we did it partly to get footfall in the shop but also to offer a service for customers			2
' times are hard for everyone and it is going reasonably well financially for us too - we covered our start - up costs in a matter of days			0
' mother - of - four @entity149 , 55 , used the service to deliver 12 @entity89 cards last week			0
she said : ' it is really great			0
you know that it is going to get there - and you know who is going to deliver it - and you ca n’t beat the price			0
' it feels good to support the local community and be part of something too			0
' mother - of - four @entity149 applauded the service as reliable and a boost to community spirit having already made £ 75 in just 14 days , the family has enough profits to print stamps and promotional flyers despite raking in profits and customers , mrs @entity9 insists @entity174 workers are accepting of their new venture , and do n't mind the extra help			1
she said : ' they ’ve still been coming in and buying their cigarettes and things so i think we are ok			0
' i do n’t think we are going to be running the @entity6 out of business anytime soon			0

@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity184 have delivered 4,000 letters in two weeks
customers drop off mail at family newsagents in @entity36 , @entity37 , and have it delivered next day for 30p if within *2.5miles* . first class stamp is 60p
