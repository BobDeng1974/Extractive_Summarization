@entity0 and @entity1 led their club sides to the @entity5 and @entity6 titles this season			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , meanwhile , performed averagely for @entity11 and @entity12 teams that finished fifth and sixth in their respective leagues			1
despite @entity17 ’s brilliant central - midfield pairing , few believe they have a hope of beating @entity19 in the opening game of the @entity21 in @entity22 this evening			1
anything but a @entity19 win might be unexpected , but it is certainly not out of the question			2
@entity19 , meanwhile , struggled against the same opponents last week , labouring to a 1 - 0 win courtesy of a second - half goal from @entity57			1
a disciplined @entity45 side lined up in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation that frustrated @entity60 , prompting jeers from @entity19 fans at half - time and the final whistle			1
@entity52 will have learned from the way @entity45 stifled @entity19 in midfield and how they tried to exploit the gaps left by @entity69 and @entity70 when @entity19 were not in possession			1
delivery : crosses from @entity17 full - backs @entity75 ( left ) and @entity76 ( right ) can cause @entity19 problems primed and ready : even without the suspended @entity78 ( second left ) @entity17 will be dangerous on a wing and a prayer in @entity76 and @entity17 have two players capable of sending dangerous crosses into the @entity19 box			1
with @entity84 and @entity85 often caught high up the pitch , and @entity69 and @entity70 prone to neglecting their defensive duties , the two experienced full - backs could have some joy on the counter-attack			0
mastermind : @entity17 coach @entity52 hopes to tactically outsmart @entity19 and spoil the party in @entity22 @entity94 @entity1 , who had a sensational season in midfield for @entity43 , will be key to the success of @entity17 ’s counter-attacking			1
the 26 - year - old can break at speed with the ball at his feet and he knows exactly when to keep it and when to thread it through to a team - mate			0
@entity43 ’s second goal in their 2 - 1 win over @entity31 in march is a perfect example of just how good he is at this			0
he and @entity0 are very good at shielding the ball so @entity17 can expect to see their fair share of possession at the @entity115			0
holy trinity : @entity17 's @entity117 ( right ) will likely join @entity0 and @entity1 in central midfield and there is a high chance they might be joined in the centre of the pitch by a third playmaker , the @entity125 prodigy @entity117			1
the 20 - year - old was superb in that win over @entity45 last year and @entity52 has opted to field him in the same team as @entity129 and @entity0 whenever possible since then			0
the absence of striker @entity78 through suspension is a big loss to @entity52 ’s side , but in @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity117 he has three players capable of creating chances for whichever striker replaces the @entity138 man , be it @entity140 , @entity141 or @entity142			0
pride and passion : former @entity145 striker @entity140 would love to score against the country of his birth prolific : @entity140 has scored 29 goals in 63 internationals for @entity17 and could be the difference tonight homecoming oh how @entity140 would love to score the winner for @entity17			1
the 31 - year - old grew up in @entity19 but spent much of the early years of his career in @entity17 with @entity155 before moving to @entity145 in 2007			2
the striker has said he will sing both national anthems before the game but as soon as the whistle goes he will be focused on denting @entity19 ’s trophy aspirations , as part of @entity17 ’s starting 11 or if he is introduced from the bench			2
@entity140 has an impressive strike - rate for @entity17 , having scored 29 goals in 63 appearances since making his international a decade ago			2
reject : @entity167 banished @entity168 out on loan to @entity170 in february but he is @entity19 's number one weak link : @entity17 can exploit the fact @entity168 has played very little football and is on poor form @entity19 are playing a @entity176 deemed surplus to requirements by @entity179 at @entity167 in february , @entity168 had to move to @entity170 to get first - team football ahead of the @entity21 , once @entity181 told him he would not consider him for the squad unless he was playing every week			1
@entity168 conceded nine goals in seven games for @entity170 , keeping just two clean sheets during that spell			0
@entity17 ’s more attack - minded players would be crazy not to test the 34 - year - old whenever possible			0
pressure : the @entity190 nation expect @entity19 to win and they will rely heavily on @entity69 ( pictured ) hype : @entity69 has been billed as the poster boy of the @entity19 @entity21 and he will need to deliver great expectations ahead of the 1950 @entity21 final the @entity190 newspaper @entity195 printed an early edition of the next day ’s paper with a photograph of the @entity19 team on the front and a caption that read : ‘ these are the world champions ’			1
the captain of their opponents @entity207 bought as many issues of the paper as he could and plastered them on his bathroom floor before encouraging his team - mates to urinate on them			0
hours later it was @entity207 that were champions of the world , having beaten @entity19 2 - 1 on their own soil			0
expectations : @entity181 managed @entity19 to glory in 2002 and hopes to do so again in 2014 complacency has got the better of them before			2
the whole world will be watching @entity19 tonight , expecting them to win comfortably			2
there is huge pressure on @entity181 and his squad to succeed where the 1950 squad fell short , by winning a @entity21 in @entity19			0
@entity69 , in particular , as the poster boy of the @entity21 , appears to be carrying the expectations of a nation on his slight shoulders			0
over to you kid .			0

@entity235 duo led club sides to @entity5 and @entity6
@entity190 @entity8 and @entity9 had average seasons for their sides
@entity19 struggled to beat @entity45 while @entity17 comfortably disposed of them
@entity17 's counter-attacking pace and crossing *ability* will hurt @entity19
@entity140 would love to score against the country of his birth
@entity167 reject @entity168 will be in goal for @entity19 and is on poor form
@entity19 have failed to live up to expectations before and could again
