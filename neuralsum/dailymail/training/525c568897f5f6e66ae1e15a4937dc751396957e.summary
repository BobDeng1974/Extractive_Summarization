the @entity1 meteor shower is due overnight in the @entity3 - and forecasters expect night owls could be treated to a spectacular display in the hours just before dawn , weather permitting			1
the waxing moon will stop sky watchers seeing too much until the hours after 3am local time in the @entity11 - but from then until dawn , meteors should be visible			1
skywatchers on the @entity15 might be able to catch a less intense shower , again just before dawn			0
@entity1 pictured over @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 in 2009 : although the shower is often spectacular , it 's very brief - and many often miss the shower of up to 200 meteors per hour , which can be visible to the naked eye the @entity1 shower is one of the year 's most spectacular , but also the shower that most astronomers miss - it 's very brief and intense			0
skywatchers on the @entity34 can expect to see between 50 and 100 meteors per hour			1
on the @entity15 , the shower will have begun to dwindle by the time the moon sets , so the rate of meteors will have slowed to between 25 and 50			2
@entity40 says , ' peaking in the wee morning hours , the @entity1 have a maximum rate of about 100 per hour , varying between 60 - 200			2
' ' the waxing gibbous moon will set around 3 a.m. local time , leaving about two hours of excellent meteor observing before dawn			2
it 's a good thing , too , because unlike the more famous perseid and @entity49 meteor showers , the @entity1 only last a few hours -- it 's the morning of january 4th , or nothing			0
' like the @entity49 , the @entity1 originate from an asteroid , called 2003 @entity52			0
dynamical studies suggest that this body could very well be a piece of a comet which broke apart several centuries ago , and that the meteors you will see before dawn are the debris from this fragmentation			0
after hundreds of years orbiting the sun , they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph , burning up 50 miles above @entity67 's surface .			1

debris of asteroid *collision* to enter atmosphere before dawn @entity3 time
up to 100 per hour expected
will burn up 50 miles above earth at 90,000mph
