the 7.05am flight from @entity12 's @entity11 to @entity13 was delayed by an hour - and - a - half because the plane was 300kg overweight due to an ' exceptionally high proportion of male passengers '			1
engineer @entity17 - who was onboard the plane to go on a skiing holiday - said the pilot struggled to find volunteers because the airline was only offering £ 100 compensation			1
jumbo : the morning @entity3 flight from @entity12 to @entity13 was 300kg overweight due to what the airline claimed was an ' exceptionally high proportion of male passengers ' on board ( file picture ) so a collection tin was passed around the cabin until enough money had been raised to persuade four people to disembark			1
mr @entity17 said a group of passengers at the front of the plane made up the compensation to £ 200 per person which was enough to persuade four passengers off the flight			1
he said the rest of the passengers then had a whip - round to help reimburse the out - of - pocket passengers at the front			2
@entity3 said the plane was over regulatory limits due to there being an " exceptionally high proportion of male passengers '			0
whip - round : passengers on board said they had to organise a whip - round as the airline was only offering £ 100 compensation which was not enough to persuade people to disembark the company insisted it was not its policy to allow whip - rounds and that ' as far as we can establish no other arrangements between passengers were made '			1
the four passengers were driven to @entity68 and put on another flight to @entity13 which arrived at 2.30pm @entity71 time			2
mr @entity17 , 40 , said : ' the whip - round certainly happened , i put two quid in			2
i saw other people throwing in fivers			0
weighty issue : @entity3 blamed a high proportion of male passengers for the extra kilos ' it is ridiculous and embarrassing for @entity3			0
i was going on a skiing trip with friends and we paid more for the early flight so we could get some more skiing time in			0
' they announced that the plane was 300kg overweight and the pilot asked for volunteers to get off			2
