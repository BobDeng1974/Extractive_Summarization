by @entity0 published : 10:56 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:43 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 fired four suspected short - range missiles into its eastern waters on thursday , a @entity7 defense official said , in an apparent effort to protest against ongoing @entity10 - @entity7 military exercises that @entity11 calls a rehearsal for invasion			1
the launches , however , were n't expected to raise tension as @entity3 routinely tests short - range missiles and it has recently sought better ties with @entity7 in what outside analysts say is an attempt to win badly - needed foreign investment and aid			1
the rival @entity24 this month held their first reunions of @entity28 - divided families in more than three years			0
the @entity45 officials who discussed the launches spoke anonymously , citing ministry rules			0
the officials said they were trying to learn exactly what @entity3 launched and that @entity7 has bolstered its monitoring on @entity3			1
@entity52 news agency , citing an unidentified military official , reported the @entity3 projectiles were suspected to be scud missiles but they could also be an upgraded version of its newly developed surface - to - ship @entity35 missiles or new types of artillery			0
tension : the @entity24 remain in a state of war , officially ( pictured is @entity3 leader @entity62 applauding as he is welcomed by members of the military at an undisclosed location ) @entity66 , a professor of @entity3 studies at @entity69 's @entity68 , played down the significance of the launches , saying the @entity3 appears to have intended to protest the @entity7 - @entity10 military drills that began monday or to grab international attention as there has been little progress over a push to resume disarmament - for - aid negotiations			1
@entity78 , a professor at the @entity79 in @entity69 , said the @entity3 also needs such launches to examine its weapons			0
last year , @entity3 furiously reacted to the same @entity7 - @entity10 military drills by issuing a torrent of fiery rhetoric and threats to launch nuclear missiles against @entity69 and @entity87			1
last year 's drills came after @entity3 conducted its third nuclear test			0
the @entity10 took the unusual step of sending nuclear - capable bombers in a show of its resolve to protect its ally			2
@entity3 has n't issued any harsh rhetoric against the current drills			0
@entity11 earlier threatened to scrap the arrangement for the family reunions but later allowed them to proceed after high - level talks with @entity69			0
@entity7 on monday offered sending vaccines and disinfectants to @entity3 after the country recently reported its first outbreak of foot - and - mouth disease since april 2011			2
earlier thursday , @entity3 presented to the media a @entity7 missionary who it says was arrested last year for allegedly trying to establish underground @entity110 churches in the country			2
@entity7 urged @entity3 to quickly release him			0
the @entity112 officially remains at war because the 1950 - 53 @entity28 ended with an armistice , not a peace treaty			1
about 28,500 @entity10 troops are stationed in @entity7 to deter potential aggression from @entity3 .			1

the projectiles were believed to have a range of more than 125 miles
the @entity112 officially remains at war with 28,500 @entity10 troops stationed in @entity7
