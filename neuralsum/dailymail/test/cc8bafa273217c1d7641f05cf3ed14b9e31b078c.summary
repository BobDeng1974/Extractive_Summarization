a previously unknown seasonal change on the sun is occurring every two years , according to a new study			2
researchers have found that twisted bands of magnetic fuel reach the surface of the sun every two years - in addition to its existing 11 - year cycle			1
and when the seasons combine , the activity of the sun can be amplified , producing mega storms that are even more dangerous to @entity14 than others			1
scientists in @entity17 have found evidence for a new solar season cycle			1
every two years it appears ' bands ' of magnetic field move to the surface			1
this combines with the existing 11 - year solar cycle , causing even more powerful coronal mass ejections ( @entity27 ) , pictured , and solar flares that can endanger @entity14 the study was carried out by a team of researchers led by the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) in @entity17			1
they found that the changes seem to be driven by bands of strong magnetic fields in the sun 's hemispheres which emanate from the solar interior			1
it was already known that the sun goes through a solar cycle of 11 years , during which its activity increases and decreases			1
solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( @entity27 ) can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity14 's magnetic field			1
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
but this shorter two - year season seems to also play a part in the sun 's activity , on a similar scale to the 11 - year cycle - despite being much quicker			1
the new solar season occurs when twisted , ring - shaped ' bands ' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a ' transition ' region in the outer third of the sun. ' much like @entity14 's jet stream , whose warps and waves have had severe impact on our regional weather patterns in the past couple of winters , the bands on the sun have very slow - moving waves that can expand and warp it too , ' said co-author dr @entity94 , a scientist at @entity95			1
' sometimes this results in magnetic fields leaking from one band to the other			0
' in other cases , the warp drags magnetic fields from deep in the solar interior , near the tachocline , and pushes them toward the surface			2
' the result of this motion is that the bands create turbulent regions of activity on the surface , causing solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( @entity27 )			1
cmes are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun , and they can pose a threat to satellites in @entity14 orbit			0
solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun , which are sometimes associated with @entity27 - although their connection is not well understood			1
the new solar season discovery occurs when twisted , ring - shaped ' bands ' of magnetic field rise from the solar interior and pass to the surface through the tachocline - a ' transition ' region in the outer third of the sun. shown in this illustration are the various different regions of the sun and a sunspot ( top right ) the bands , which appear in each hemisphere of the sun , cause the 11 - year solar cycle to actually become a longer cycle that lasts 22 years			1
the 11 - year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun ’s activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots , flares and other visible differences			1
a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released			2
radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end			0
the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100 - megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time a flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots			2
their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods			0
however , the cause of the 11 - year cycle is poorly understood			1
and according to this new research , when the 11 - year cycle combines with the two - year cycle , the solar storms that pummel @entity14 's atmosphere can be amplified			1
the bands appear to take place separately in the northern and southern hemispheres , with activity peaking over 11 months , then dropping over another 11 months			2
the almost annual variations can be likened to regions on @entity14 that have two seasons , such as a rainy season and a dry season			0
' what we 're looking at here is a massive driver of solar storms , ' said dr @entity199 , lead author of the new study and director of @entity32 's @entity202			2
' by better understanding how these activity bands form in the sun and cause seasonal instabilities , there 's the potential to greatly improve forecasts of space weather events			2
' the overlapping bands are fueled by the rotation of the sun 's deep interior , according to observations by the research team			0
the study , published this week in @entity218 , could help lead to better predictions of massive geomagnetic storms in @entity14 's outer atmosphere that sometimes disrupt satellite operations , communications , power grids and other technologies			0
the research was funded by @entity228 and the @entity229 , which is @entity32 's sponsor			0
the 11 - year solar cycle sees a periodic change in the sun ’s activity - such as the number of ejections - in addition to changes in the number of sunspots , flares and other visible differences			1
shown here are images of the sun over one cycle showing changes in its activity the surges of magnetic fuel from the @entity250 's interior catastrophically destabilise the corona , the sun 's outermost atmosphere			2
they are the driving force behind the most destructive solar storms			0
' these surges or " whomps " as we have dubbed them , are responsible for over 95 per cent of the large flares and @entity263 - the ones that are really devastating , ' dr @entity199 said			0
the almost - annual variability can also help explain a cold - war era puzzle : why do powerful solar flares and @entity267 often peak a year or more after the maximum number of sunspots ? this lag is known as the @entity271 , after the @entity273 scientist who first reported it in the 1940s			2
the answer appears to be that seasonal changes may cause an upswing in solar disturbances long after the peak in the solar cycle			1
researchers can turn to advanced computer simulations and more detailed observations to learn more about the profound influence of the bands on solar activity			0
dr @entity199 said this could be assisted by a proposed network of satellites observing the sun , much as the global networks of satellites around @entity14 have helped advance terrestrial weather models since the 1960s			0
' if you understand what the patterns of solar activity are telling you , you 'll know whether we 're in the stormy phase or the quiet phase in each hemisphere , ' dr @entity199 said			0
' if we can combine these pieces of information , forecast skill goes through the roof			0

scientists in @entity17 have found evidence for a new solar season cycle
every two years it appears ' bands ' of magnetic field move to the surface
the sun was already known to have an 11 - year solar cycle
when the two combine it can create amplified and dangerous storms
