@entity0 has attacked @entity2 ’s bizarre transfer policy after claiming the sale of @entity4 for just £ 16m is ‘ strange ’			1
@entity2 have spent fortunes this summer to sign @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it ’s not the way i would expect @entity2 to go about their business , i thought it would be more controlled			1
i have to admit i thought the @entity4 sale was a strange one , but that ’s just me			1
‘ of all the prices paid this summer , there are right backs and left - backs galore who have been bought for £ 14m , £ 15m , £ 16m ? ‘ how have @entity19 got him [ @entity4 ] for £ 16m ? i ca n’t work it out			1
it has helped out a competitor because @entity19 are the team they are fighting for fourth possibly			1
‘ i am struggling to work out the logic , i ca n’t understand it			0
it ’s odd in two or three ways			0
‘ @entity6 tipped them over the edge , it surprised and shocked everyone			2
how he gets them in that team i do n’t know			0
how they get @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity6 , @entity9 , @entity47 and @entity48 into that team i do n’t know			1
’ @entity50 signed @entity4 after first choice striker @entity51 fractured his ankle @entity6 joined @entity2 on a season - long loan deal with the option of a permanent deal @entity0 went on to claim @entity2 have over-paid for players after their seventh placed finish in the @entity59 last season			1
he told @entity60 : ‘ in one sense i am excited because they have signed world class players			2
people jumped on the bandwagon last year and said they would n’t attract players , but they have a massive commercial operation			0
‘ they have overpaid , there is no doubt about that but people will still go there			0
’ @entity4 is expected to start for @entity19 on saturday when they take on @entity74 at the @entity75 in the @entity59			1
the @entity22 striker , who scored twice for his country against @entity78 on tuesday , admitted he needs a run of games up front to prove he is a top player for club and country			2
@entity19 ’s £ 16m signing said : ‘ it is well known i prefer to play through the middle so when i get my opportunity i just want to show what i can do			2
once i get into the box and getting the opportunities i have got faith in my ability			0
@entity2 broke the @entity93 transfer record when they paid £ 60m for @entity7 ‘ before i was n’t getting into the box because i was n’t playing too much as a striker and i had to worry about my defensive work			1
i just know once i get the opportunity and a run of games up front i will do my best			0
‘ that ’s definitely what i need			0
it is good for any footballer to get a run of games			0
you become more confident and play much more ease and to get a run of games would be absolutely perfect			0
that is my first 90 minutes this season so it is just the start of things and really looking forward to it			0
