a father who stabbed his girlfriend and their six - year - old son to death has failed in a legal bid to inherit her full state but will still receive £ 60,000 worth of assets			1
@entity8 , 35 , was already entitled to half the proceeds of any sale of the bungalow he owned with @entity13 , in @entity14 , @entity15 , but was also bidding for her half of £ 60,000 , as well as another £ 20,000 of assets in her name			1
however , the landscape gardener - who admitted two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility last october - had his claim rejected by judge @entity27 at @entity28 today			1
@entity8 , 35 , who stabbed his partner @entity13 ( together above ) and their six - year - old son in april last year , had been trying to claim he was entitled to her £ 60,000 share of the bungalow they owned in @entity15 @entity8 , who is currently being held at @entity36 psychiatric hospital in @entity37 after being sentenced to an indefinite hospital order for his crimes , submitted a claim to the court for his partner 's assets			1
he claimed that @entity45 employee @entity44 , 40 , would have wished him to inherit the £ 80,000 and said he was ' very unwell ' at the time of the killings on april 9 last year , which he added were ' not by my hands '			2
@entity8 was calm and composed when he appeared at the trial on monday to argue that he should be entitled to the balance of miss @entity13 's estate			1
wearing a crumpled red and white striped shirt and short blue tie , he said : ‘ it is not about benefiting			0
i nearly took my own life			0
i have got about 20 injuries to myself and stuff			0
‘ this is to put to the courtroom that i was very unwell at the time			0
i have been through the worst that i could ever imagine			0
it ca n’t get any worse than i already have			0
‘ i have lost more than any money that can be given to me			0
i have lost more than that			0
i have not benefited in any way			0
i have lost @entity13 and i have lost my son @entity66			1
money can not take away from that			0
‘ money does not mean anything in life , happiness is the main thing in life			0
’ the law states that those convicted of murder or manslaughter can not inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes , but the forfeiture rule can be modified to take into account the conduct of the offender , the deceased and any other relevant material concerned			2
@entity8 admitted two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after stabbing his partner @entity13 , 40 , and their six - year - old son @entity66 ( together above ) at the family home in april last year today , judge @entity96 said : ' in my judgment the justice of the case does not require that i modify the effect of the forfeiture rule in the circumstances of this case			1
' he added : ' while the level of culpability is reduced and even perhaps significantly reduced by the impact of the mental disorder from which the claimant was suffering on 9 april 2013 , it was not eliminated or reduced to the level where it could properly be said to be so low that to give effect to the forfeiture rule would be contrary to the public interest			0
' the estate is destined for miss @entity13 's extended family of aunts and cousins			1
@entity8 had argued that ' small amounts of money scattered thinly ' would make less difference than giving him the chance to buy a house , rather than half a house			1
the killer had attempted to take his own life before the bodies of his partner and son @entity66 were discovered at the property on april 9 last year			1
he was taken to hospital with stab wounds before being taken into custody and later transferred to @entity36 , where he has been ever since			0
in this week 's hearing , his barrister @entity135 told the court that @entity8 was a changed man who was hoping to rebuild his life at some point			1
he said : ' @entity8 has a very , very low level of culpability for what happened			2
it is a serious offence that he is in treatment ( for ) , not in prison			0
' the size of the estate is modest			0
small amounts of money scattered thinly are going to make less difference than to give the complainant some potential to rebuild his life after he is released back into the community			0
' @entity153 , representing miss @entity13 's aunt , @entity155 , told the trial that miss @entity13 made a will before her death which said her estate should go to @entity8 in the event of her death			1
but the barrister said that will did not ' contemplate the circumstances of her death '			2
he said : ' therefore , as an expression of her wishes it does not really assist the court			0
' miss @entity13 's aunt , @entity155 , welcomed the ruling			1
in a statement released by @entity172 solicitors , she said : ' it is our belief that justice has been done			2
' we have faced a nine - month ordeal preparing for this case			2
we have had to relive the harrowing details of @entity13 and @entity66 's death and listen to @entity8 pleading the victim in court			1
judge @entity27 rejected his claim in a written ruling at @entity28 ( pictured ) today ' but we were willing to bear this torment to defend the principle that crime should not pay			1
' we hope this is the end of this matter and we are able find peace and know that @entity13 and @entity66 's memory has not been violated by this killer			1
' the judge noted that @entity8 still has a half - share of the house and also half of the couple 's joint bank account			1
he said : ' while there is no evidence to suggest that the claimant 's release is imminent , i have proceeded on the basis that there will come a time when he will be released and will require funds to help him to re-establish his life in the community			2
' while it is clear that the claimant has earned his living in the past from semi-skilled self - employed gardening work , i accept that it may be difficult for him to earn his living in that way in the future			2
' whilst these factors weigh in the balance in favour of modifying the effect of the @entity222 , in my judgement they do not outweigh the other factors to which i have referred			0
