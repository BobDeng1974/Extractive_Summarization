by @entity0 for thousands of years , nature has been blamed for the deadly floods of @entity4 's @entity3 , long known in @entity4 as the ‘ @entity5 ’ and ‘ @entity3			1
’ but according to a recent study , it was human activity rather than @entity9 that began changing the river ’s natural flow 3,000 years ago , leading to the death of millions			2
the report provides the earliest known archaeological evidence of man - made , large - scale levees and other flood - control systems in the eastern region			2

according to a recent study by @entity24 , it was human activity rather than @entity9 that began changing the river ’s natural flow 3,000 years ago , leading to the death of millions through flooding it suggests the @entity4 government ’s long - running efforts to tame the @entity3 with levees , dikes and drainage ditches actually made flooding much worse			1
this , they claim , set the stage for a catastrophic flood between 14 - 17 ad , which may have triggered the collapse of the @entity39			1
‘ human intervention in the @entity4 environment is relatively massive , remarkably early and nowhere more keenly witnessed than in attempts to harness the @entity3 , ’ said dr @entity40 from @entity24			2
for thousands of years , the destructive force of nature has been blamed for the deadly floods of @entity4 's @entity3 , long known in @entity4 as the ‘ @entity5 ’ and ‘ @entity3 ’ the southwest corner of the brick quarry dig site at @entity49 shows remnants of the bank / levee in the sedimentary record			1
it shows a vicious cycle of primitive levees built larger and larger as erosion increased and periodic floods grew more widespread and destructive the @entity59 was regarded as the first unified and powerful empire in @entity4 history while there are many theories behind the fall of the @entity39 , dr @entity40 ’s research suggests human interaction with the environment played a central role in its demise			1
a census taken by @entity4 in 2 ad suggests the area struck by the massive 14 - 17 ad flood was very heavily populated , with an average of 122 people per square kilometre , or approximately 9.5 million people living directly in the flood ’s path			1
historical accounts indicate that communities hit by the flood were soon in complete disarray , with reports of people resorting to banditry to obtain food and stay alive			0
by @entity89 20 - 21 , the devastated region had become the centre of a rebellion that would end the @entity39 ’s five - century reign of power			0
‘ in some ways , these findings offer a new benchmark for the beginning of the @entity98 , the epoch in which humans became the most dominant global force in nature			0
’ ‘ by 2,000 years ago , people were controlling the @entity3 , or at least thought they were controlling it , and that ’s the problem			2
’ dr @entity40 ’s research is based on a study of sedimentary soils deposited along the @entity3 over thousands of years			2
it included data from the @entity110 site , known today as ‘ @entity4 ’s @entity111 , ’ which was slowly buried beneath five metres of sediment during a massive flood in 14 to 17 ad			2
it also looked at the @entity49 site , discovered in 2012 , includes the remains of a human - constructed levee and three irrigation / drainage ditches dating to the @entity119 from 1046 – 256 bc. researchers examined about 50 vertical feet of exposed soil layers at the @entity49 site , cleaning sections of a quarry wall to reveal patterns of sedimentary deposits dating back about 10,000 years			0

image b offers a closer view of the boxed section showing mixed and loaded sediments near the base of the bank / levee nearly a third of this 10,000 - year cross-section has been deposited in the last 2,000 years , indicating that the rate of deposit has steadily increased at a pace that mirrors the expansion of human activity in the region			0
‘ our analysis clearly shows that these levees are not naturally formed berms , but are indeed artificially created through the work of humans , ’ said dr @entity40			0
his research suggests the @entity4 began building drainage canals and bank systems along the lower reaches of the @entity3 between 2,900 and 2,700 years ago			1

the @entity171 is indicated by shading while there are many theories behind the fall of the @entity39 , dr @entity40 ’s research suggests human interaction with the environment played a central role in its demise			1
pictured are @entity39 laborers dressing clay statues of imperial army soldiers ‘ it ’s easy to see the trap they fell into , ’ dr @entity40 said			0
‘ building levees causes sediments to accumulate in the river bed , raising the river higher , and making it more vulnerable to flooding , which requires you to build the levee higher , which causes the sediments to accumulate , and the process repeats itself			1

@entity4 built canals and banks along @entity3 around 2,900 years ago
sedimentary record shows a vicious cycle of levees built larger and larger
building large levees caused sediments to accumulate on the river bed
this caused riverbed to rise making it more vulnerable to major flooding
levees set the stage for devastating flood that killed millions in 14 - 17 ad
study suggests human interaction with the environment played a central role in the @entity39 's demise after five centuries in power
