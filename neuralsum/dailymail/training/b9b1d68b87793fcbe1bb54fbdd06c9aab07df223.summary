cabinet office minister @entity57 ( pictured ) last night issued an 11th - hour plea to the tanker drivers - who earn about £ 45,000 a year , but are threatening strike action over pay , pensions and working conditions ‘ although we are pushing for an agreement , we have learnt the lessons of the past and stand ready to act to minimise disruption to motorists , to industry and , in particular , to our emergency services , in the event of a strike			1
' the contingency plans have been drawn up by mr @entity57 , transport secretary @entity100 , home secretary @entity101 , health secretary @entity102 and energy secretary @entity103			0

it closes tomorrow , with the result expected later in the day			0
@entity21 says on its online ballot form : ‘ while the oil industry rakes in multi-billion - pound profits , the drivers who supply fuel to forecourts across the country are being squeezed			1
‘ for over a year , @entity21 has been trying to convince the industry to bring some stability back into the supply of this vital national commodity			1
' yet , behind the scenes , the major employers have been slashing drivers ’ terms and conditions and cutting corners on training and safety in a bid to win contracts			0
’ in response , bosses say drivers are well - rewarded , working just 37 hours a week for their £ 45,000 annual salary			0
however , @entity21 ’s militant leader , @entity143 , who is on £ 100,000 a year , claims that drivers ’ working conditions have deteriorated as supermarkets and oil companies contract out work to haulage firms which negotiate separate wage and conditions deals with their drivers			2
the union is @entity43 ’s biggest financial backer			2
if the strike goes ahead , @entity43 leader @entity155 will come under pressure to say if he backs it			0

in last week ’s @entity169 , chancellor @entity168 said a 3p per litre fuel duty increase will take effect on august 1 , as planned			0
