by @entity0 for @entity1 if you had driven past the @entity3 in @entity4 this thursday you would have thought the billionaire @entity6 playboys were back in town again			1
there was a queue of over £ 5m worth of supercars were parked in a line for the start of the @entity13 2014			1
two @entity15 spiders , @entity16 and an @entity17 , a @entity18 , a @entity19 , @entity20 , and my latest toy , the gorgeous @entity23			2
so sexy in fact that when stopped at the lights on the way down @entity36 , wearing my new @entity38 sunglasses i was approached by a stunning model who came over and just started talking to me out of the blue and then gave me her number			1
behind the wheel : the @entity0 star is ready to go for a spin pocket rocket : @entity0 drove the small but perfectly formed car that does n't normally happen , it 's got to be something to do with the motor i suppose , or the glasses , or both			1
anyway back to the start of the race and there was much revving of engines as we prepared to put our cars on the @entity62 to start the first leg of the five day journey down to @entity65 – with @entity67 's merry men and women			2
@entity67 is a high - end party organiser and this little jaunt is going to visit all the six - star hotels from the @entity71 of @entity72 , to @entity73 in @entity74 , then on to @entity75 , and then on to the @entity77 @entity76 at @entity65			0
the last time i was involved in the @entity81 rally i did n’t actually make it off @entity84 soil			0
i was the passenger in a £ 220k @entity16 and the driver took a corner badly in the wet , flipped the car and wrote the @entity88 off completely before we even got to @entity89			0
pulling power : the car helped him get a phone number from a model i was actually asleep at the time and luckily emerged unscathed but it meant that my @entity81 race was seriously cut short			1
anyway this year i ’m taking no chances with the car and for insurance purposes i have fitted a @entity100 1080 camera on the windscreen of the car			0
it ’s an hd cctv camera that you stick to the front windscreen and it records any incident and can be used as evidence of who is at fault if you are in a crash			0
pretty important for me as i do n’t want to have to pay for a new @entity23 if someone totals this			0
but as an added bonus is that the quality of the footage is amazing so it ’s great for making videos of motor sport races or road trips like this			0
so wish me luck and hopefully i will actually get to @entity72 and back in one piece and i 'll see you all next week			2
lots of love , @entity0 .			1
