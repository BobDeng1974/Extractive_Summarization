for the first time this year , @entity1 ’s @entity0 has spotted its robotic companion on the surface of the red planet			1
the orbiting spacecraft captured a shot of @entity8 near the base of @entity10 in @entity11			2
but interestingly , the rover ’s tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the @entity15 weather			1
the @entity17 camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches ( 25cm ) per pixel , allowing it to spot the rover on the surface			2
it is seen here in the full image , circled			0
the rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light - toned outcrops of rock the image was taken using the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) camera on the @entity15 satellite , from a height of 187 miles ( 300km ) above the surface			1
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			1
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity15			1
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity15			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity46 at approximately 900kg ( 2,000lbs )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity11			0
it is not the first time it has spotted @entity8 , or indeed other rovers , on the surface - but it is the first time in 2015			2
the @entity17 camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches ( 25cm ) per pixel , allowing it to see @entity8 , which is the size of a car			2
in this image the rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light - toned outcrops of rock			0
these rocks are part of the @entity71 in the @entity72 , which is an area of sandstones , siltstones and calcium sulphate veins on the surface			0
they are the lowest exposed rocks of @entity10 - also known as @entity10 - which @entity1 is planning to send @entity8 up at some point			1
in the image the rover had recently completed a drive of about 75ft ( 23 metres ) during its 949th day on @entity15 - also known as a sol. @entity83 is towards the top in the image , with the entire view spanning about 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) across			1
curiosity has been driving a route through an area called @entity90 , on its way to the higher layers of @entity10 after examining @entity71			0
its ultimate science destination , @entity94 , is at the bottom left of the image			0
@entity1 scientists in @entity98 have revealed a distant image of @entity8 ( shown )			1
it was taken by the @entity0 from 187 miles up			1
one interesting aspect is that the rover 's tracks can not be seen			1
this may be due to @entity15 weather or they blend in with the surface here 's the view from the surface : curiosity took this image of @entity112 around a similar time that the @entity0 spacecraft spotted it from orbit			1
the rover is now on its way to a region called @entity94 aside from keeping track of the rover , this image also allows scientists to monitor nearby sand dunes			2
and the absence of the rover ’s tracks also hints at one of two possibilities			0
it may be that @entity15 wind has swept them away , or it could be that the dark sand dug up by the wheels as they move is a similar colour to the surface , and thus indistinguishable			1
the last time @entity8 was spotted from orbit was more than four months ago			0
another benefit of taking this sort of image is to find upcoming landmarks that might be of interest for the rover			0
curiosity has now been on @entity15 for almost 1,000 days , having landed on 6 august 2012			0
shown here is a mosaic of images creating a self - portrait of the rover , which makes it look like someone else has taken it			0

@entity1 scientists in @entity98 have revealed a distant image of @entity8 taken by the @entity0
it was taken from an altitude of 187 miles ( 300km ) up , revealing where the rover is heading towards
one interesting aspect is that the rover 's tracks can not be seen behind it in the image
this may be due to @entity15 weather or that they are the same colour as the surrounding surface
