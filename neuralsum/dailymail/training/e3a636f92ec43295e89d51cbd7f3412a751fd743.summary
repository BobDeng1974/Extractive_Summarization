by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 28 may 2012 updated : 02:29 est , 29 may 2012 beaten his demons : @entity3 , pictured at the @entity4 in @entity5 this week , says at school he was ' always on the verge of exploding into violence ' @entity3 has revealed his regret that he never fought back against the bullies who tormented him at school			1
the mild - mannered star of @entity13 hit show @entity15 was targeted with taunts that he was gay but said that although he was always on the edge of taking violent revenge he always suppressed the urge			1
now , however , he is left wondering if that was the right decision			2
and he spoke of his disappointment that similar jibes followed him into the world of television			1
bespectacled @entity3 , 36 , a married father of one , grew up in @entity25			2
talking about his days as a freckle - faced schoolboy he admitted that being bullied was ‘ ghastly ’			2
he added : ‘ you have those moments where you do n’t want to get up and go to school			1
‘ i was always on the edge of exploding into violence			1
i definitely have a temper – but i never did because i always somehow did n’t want to lose my dignity			2
‘ it never quite got to ‘ ‘ i ’m just going to lamp them ’ ’ , but looking back i kind of wish i had because it would have solved it			2
‘ i am not endorsing violence , but maybe it would have been better to just have a bit of a scrap in the playground			1
’ the bullies may well have had a lucky escape			0
no one who watched @entity3 propel the @entity47 to the number one spot last @entity50 with @entity51 could doubt the steel within his slight build			0
he said the real key was to give people the tools to deal with the problem themselves , which for him was in music and the arts			0
he is married to @entity60 , an @entity61 teacher in an inner - city school , and they have a baby daughter , @entity64			1
but @entity3 – who ten years ago was an out - of - work music graduate – has still suffered jokes about his sexuality			0
the star , who is on protein drinks to bulk up his muscles and goes to the gym , told @entity75 : ‘ it was slightly disappointing , after leaving school and leaving all that behind me from the age of about 15 to 30 , to come into television and discover ‘ ‘ oh right , everyone is just as juvenile as the kids at school were ! ’ ’ ‘ i mean , i am fairly flamboyant and expressive , but i know plenty of gay people who are incredibly repressed and are n’t showy and do n’t like @entity81 , you know			1
’ however , he said he had now ‘ exorcised his demons ’			0
expressive : @entity3 with members of the @entity47 , which he created himself @entity3 , who taught music to underprivileged children before dreaming up the idea for @entity15 , said it was difficult to get men to sing because they do n’t want to make ‘ idiots ’ of themselves and generally believe singing is only acceptable at football or in the bath			0
he added that he had often heard it said that singing ‘ is a bit gay ’ or ‘ makes you gay ’ or ‘ gay - ifies you ’			0
the @entity47 – created by @entity3 – is made up of partners of service personnel who have been away at war			0
he is now filming another series of @entity15 to air later this year and has also shot a pilot for a new show in @entity109 , where the choir is being shown on @entity111 .			0
