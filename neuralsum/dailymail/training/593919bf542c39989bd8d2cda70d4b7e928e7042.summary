by @entity1 reporter published : 00:23 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 03:48 est , 15 october 2012 chronic stress during pregnancy can cause depression , a new study has found			1
researchers also discovered that mental perks associated with pregnancy were negated by chronic stress			1
lead author doctor @entity9 said the findings increased understanding of postnatal depression which was a ' devastating ' condition			0
new findings : mothers who experience chronic stress during pregnancy are more likely to suffer from depression ( posed by model ) dr @entity9 said rat mothers , not exposed to stress , showed an increase in brain cell connections in regions associated with learning , memory and mood			1
in contrast , the brains of mother rats that were stressed twice a day - by being put in water or having their mobility restricted - did not show this increase			1
researchers looked at the rats ' dendritic spines - hair - like growths on brain cells that are used to exchange information with other neurons and found they increased almost 20 per cent in new mothers			1
the boost improves cognitive functioning , especially multitasking			0
the rats that were stressed show no boost in dendritic spines and also had less physical interaction with their babies			2
this behaviour is observed in human mothers who experience postnatal depression			2
making progress : researchers believe the findings could help to understand postnatal depression ( posed by model ) dr @entity9 , an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at @entity62 in the @entity63 , said : ' animal mothers in our research that are unstressed show an increase in the number of connections between neurons			1
' we think that makes the stressed mothers more vulnerable			1
they do n't have the capacity for brain plasticity that the unstressed mothers do , and somehow that 's contributing to their susceptibility to depression			2
and they were not very good mothers			0
' after separation from pups for 30 minutes , unstressed mothers would gather up their babies , put them in the nest and nurse them			0
' stressed mother rats left the pups scattered around , wandered around the cage and fed the babies less frequently			0
' the stressed mother rats also exhibited more floating than unstressed rats in a water test ; animals that float rather than swim are showing depressive - like symptoms			1
' these findings in rats mimic some of the symptoms that are seen in women with postpartum depression , ' @entity9 said			0
dr @entity9 described the research during a talk in @entity103 at @entity104 , the annual meeting of the @entity106			0
she said postpartum depression was a devastating condition and understanding it better may help prevent some of its damaging effects			0
' it 's devastating not only for the mother , because it affects her well - being , but previous research also has shown that children of depressed mothers have impaired cognitive and social development , may have impaired physical development , and are more likely as adults to have depression or anxiety , ' she said			2
' a better understanding of postpartum depression is important to help the mother but also to prevent some of the damaging effects that this disorder can have on the child			0

those stressed twice a day showed ' depressive - like symptoms '
mental perks associated with pregnancy were also ' negated ' by chronic stress
@entity62 carried out the study on rat mothers
