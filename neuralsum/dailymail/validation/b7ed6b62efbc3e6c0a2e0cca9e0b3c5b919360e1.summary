how extraordinary that so much effort , by so many royal advisors and politicians , should have been expended in keeping secret what a future head of state has written to government ministers			2
all those who deplore the @entity8 ’s decision , however , are wrong			1
for i believe this is a great day not only for the freedom of information which the law demands and allows			0
it should also be seen as a great day for the monarchy			0
the @entity8 ruling that prince @entity20 ' 27 ' black spider ' memos should be released marks not only a great day for the freedom of information , but also one for the monarchy one @entity25 bigwig recently told me that the @entity20 ’s letters would reveal him to be ‘ barking mad ’ , but when i questioned him , he admitted he had not read a word of them			1
i thought this was a good example of how much damage the secrecy over his letters has done the @entity20			1
when we are told that his correspondence is so hush - hush that it must be suppressed , we naturally imagine his letters will be inflammatory , or embarrassingly eccentric			0
we remember some of the @entity20 ’s strong turns of phrase , as when , in his leaked diaries , he described senior members of the communist @entity43 government as ‘ appalling old waxworks ’			1
we remember , too , his tendency to self - pity and self - absorption , and the round - robin letter to friends in which he complained about being seated in club - class on a plane to @entity43 for the @entity54 hand - over to the @entity56 government in 1997 , saying tetchily his seat was ‘ uncomfortable ’			0
but despite this , many of his views are eminently sensible			2
he is bursting with ideas on subjects as varied as the environment , architecture , town planning , @entity66 , agriculture , the @entity68 and much else besides			1
what ’s more , his opinions on architectural carbuncles or on the need for caution over genetically modified food are shared by countless numbers of @entity76			0
contrary to popular belief , the @entity77 has not always been completely above the political fray for decades , he has been a sort of one - man @entity81 to many of the idiotic or ugly things going on in our country			1
many commentators have said that they deplore the prince sounding off and getting involved in the day - to - day running of this country ’s affairs			2
they fear that if he expresses views , he will be seen as having a political bias			2
this , they claim , could not be more different from the approach which has been so successfully pursued by the @entity77 – who is believed not to express opinions to individual ministers			1
the monarchy is deemed to be strengthened by her majesty ’s silence			0
but the @entity77 has not always been completely above the political fray – and for all we know , she might have made any number of interventions and recommendations to ministers of which we know nothing			1
how else , for instance , did we all come to be told the story that she deeply disagreed with mrs @entity113 about the @entity115 ’s refusal to impose trade sanctions on @entity117 during the apartheid years ? the @entity77 certainly had a vested interest – as she feared for the future of her @entity121 and even lined up with her @entity121 leaders against the @entity76 prime minister			1
the story was impeccably sourced – to the @entity77 ’s press secretary of the day , @entity126 – yet it was denied by no. 10			1
the row over @entity117 was undoubtedly an example of the monarch so - called ‘ interfering ’			0
anyway , the truth is that we no longer live in an age of deference			0
nor do we live in an age of secrecy			0
yesterday ’s judgment makes plain that @entity20 can not hide the contents of the 27 letters to @entity139 ministers			1
it is entirely right that letters which he writes to publicly elected representatives about matters of government policy should be made available to the public			0
but ever since an amendment to the @entity148 in 2011 , any such correspondence is legally deemed to be private			0
ever since an amendment to the @entity148 in 2011 , any correspondence by the @entity150 is legally deemed to be private regardless , i would support to the utmost not only his right , but his duty to get involved in political issues – as long as he does not undermine his position or that of the monarchy			0
but answer this question : would you rather have a king who spoke up for the silent majority against self - appointed experts on agriculture , architecture , defence , youth employment , education , @entity170 – or would you rather have an ignoramus ? what is the point of his having established so much expertise in certain fields if he can not share it with ministers ? the corollary of his ‘ interference ’ is that when he does speak up , he should be prepared to argue his position in public , rather than in spidery secret memos			2
for my money , i ’d far rather have a head of state who ‘ interferes ’ occasionally – as @entity20 is likely to do – than one who sits back and leaves everything to politicians who think only of their own interests rather than the country ’s .			2

the @entity8 ruled that prince @entity20 ' memos should be released
known as ' black spider ' memos because of royal *'s* *scrawled* handwriting
but many of his views on the environment and agriculture are sensible
and contrary to popular belief , the @entity77 is *n't* completely above politics
