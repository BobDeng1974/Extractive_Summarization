@entity0 clearly does n't have claustrophobia because her 90 - square - foot apartment in @entity3 is enough to make anyone afraid of closed spaces ill. the young fashion worker gave curbed a ' tour ' of her apartment to show how she has sacrificed on space to live in the upscale @entity11 neighborhood , where she can count @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 as neighbors			1
and at just $ 775 a month in rent - it 's a steal by @entity19 standards , where the median rent for a 1 - bedroom apartment in her neighborhood is $ 3,200			1
these pictures , and more on @entity26 's site , show just how well @entity0 has adapted the space			1
while other students scoffed at the comically small space , @entity0 saw it as an opportunity to streamline her life			1
' i really like getting rid of things , ' @entity0 told @entity26			2
' it 's my favorite thing			0
' it was n't until she started taking measurements for the apartment that she realized the unique design challenges she was going to face			0
walk - in closet ... of sorts : @entity0 has artfully constructed a closet using rails that stick out the wall doubling up : the sink is used for cooking but also to clean clothes steal : the small space costs just $ 750 a month - which is extremely low compared to the $ 3,200 median rent for the neighborhood neat and tidy : clever storage solutions help keep @entity0 's shoebox orderly , including a pole that hands her kitchen utensils and folding bistro chairs that can be hung up on the wall when not in use close quarters : one of the downsides is the fact that @entity0 has to share a bathroom with one of the two other tenants in the building at just 78 - inches wide , the apartment photographed for @entity26 by @entity80 is smaller than a standard bed frame			1
when her initial plans to build a pull - down murphy bed fell apart , she was forced to build a custom bed - frame which she tricked out with added storage space underneath			2
prior to moving into the @entity11 apartment , @entity0 lived with roommates			1
her bedroom has always been small but she had gotten used to having access to a full kitchen a living room			0
in her new apartment , there just is n't the space			2
for a kitchen , @entity0 has a sink and a sliver of counter space where she can cook on a hot pot. on shelves above that she keeps a toaster oven , microwave , and more storage boxes			1
@entity0 says she has been able to feed herself fine in the kitchen , using it to make such elaborate meals as pork chops and baked eggs			0
while she has to use the sink for both cooking and washing up			0
the entire building has just three units and only one is a true one bedroom with a bathroom			0
@entity0 and another tenant share a bathroom located just across the hall			0
perhaps the biggest issue in the apartment for @entity0 is lack of a closet , since her job in the fashion industry means she has a well - stocked wardrobe			1
@entity0 has so many clothes that she ca n't keep them in the apartment at one time			1
however , she has had luck using the storage company @entity128 which delivers and picks up boxes at her door for just $ 25 a month			0
for the few clothes she does keep at her apartment , @entity0 stores them on three pipe hangers right next to the door			2
to keep her shopping in check , @entity0 also has a rule that any time she buys something new , she donates another item			0
@entity0 told @entity26 : ' my boyfriend tried to give me a book last week , and i said , ' no , there is no place for this			0
' @entity0 says she 's constantly cleaning to keep the place in order and has opted for a more simple design scheme to steer clear of clutter			2
while @entity0 loves her apartment , she 's planning on moving within the year since she has plans to rent a place with her boyfriend .			1
