occasional wine drinkers will be saying cheers to a new gadget designed to prevent opened bottles from going off			1
the revolutionary device , which goes on sale for £ 269 today , pierces corks using an ultra-thin needle which wine can then be poured through			1
this prevents air getting into the bottle and stops the wine from going off , meaning drinkers can enjoy a glass or two of their favourite tipple without having to polish off the whole lot			1
once the needle is removed the pressure on the cork closes the hole back up , protecting the leftover wine from oxidation			2
manufacturers of the device say drinkers can still be enjoying wine from the same bottle months after it was first opened			1
the only downside is that it takes 25 seconds to pour each glass of wine using the needle			1

the remaining wine could then go back in my cellar , so that i could enjoy it again whenever i wanted			0
' mr @entity55 is thrilled with the final result but admits that it has been a long time coming , with the device taking him ten years to develop			0
' what followed was a decade of development and testing until i had a system that left the cork in place , but still delivered great glasses of wine , indistinguishable from untouched bottles			2
