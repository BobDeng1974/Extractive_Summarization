by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 forward @entity2 admits the relegation - threatened @entity3 have hit ' rock bottom ' but sends out a note of defiance ahead of their game against @entity9 at the @entity10 on friday night			1
captain @entity11 takes charge of his first match as caretaker coach following the sacking of head coach @entity16 and assistant @entity17 in the wake of sunday 's demoralising 46 - 18 defeat at @entity20			1
it was the latest twist in a season of woe for the @entity3 which began with the deduction of six points for going into administration and leaves them with the unlikely task of needing to win at least five of their last 11 matches to preserve their @entity32 status			2
where now ? @entity3 forward @entity2 admits the relegation - threatened @entity3 have hit ' rock bottom ' ' sadly we are used to things going against us but we 're not rolling over and calling it quits , ' @entity2 said			1
' obviously confidence is shot at the minute			2
' @entity40 has put his hand up and his first day as coach was good			1
we had a good session and he delivered his messages and his game plan over to us really well			2
' credit to @entity40 for doing that			2
obviously @entity17 and @entity48 were a big part of our group and held us together for so long so it 's sad , but as a group we owe it to them and to ourselves to try and get some performances			0
' we are trying to gain something to give us that little bit of confidence to move forward			0
' @entity16 paid the price for the below - par performances of his players and the 31 - year - old @entity2 , who had a two - year spell at @entity9 from 2008 - 09 , acknowledged he endured an off day at @entity20 , which was a sad way to mark his 300th career appearance			1
' there is no point looking at the table , we know where we 're at , ' @entity2 said			1
' we 're all striving to be that bit better in what we 're doing			0
trouble : the @entity3 lost to @entity70 ( centre ) and @entity20 this week and are second bottom in @entity32 paying the price : head coach @entity16 was sacked as they attempt to avoid relegation ' i know at the weekend i was second guessing over things that i 'd normally take for granted			1
i do n't know if it was pressure , it just seemed to be one of them where we fall in a heap			0
it seems to come down to a lack of trust in your own ability and the situation that we 're in			0
' if @entity3 are to pull off ' mission impossible ' , a win over a weakened @entity92 is essential and @entity2 sees the visit of his old club as a potential life - saver			1
' it 's a winnable game but we 've not been helping ourselves at times , ' he said			0
' our backs are completely against the wall now , we are at rock bottom , so we definitely need to come out fighting			0
' regardless of the result , we need to get some confidence back , and hopefully off the back of that the performances and wins will come			0
' @entity9 are in a similar boat to ourselves			0
they 've got a decent enough squad to be able to play well but they are a bit hit and miss. it should be a good battle between two teams looking for a bit of momentum			0
' rovers have slipped out of the top eight after conceding 88 points in their last two matches , and former @entity3 favourite @entity119 joined fellow forwards @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 on the sidelines with a season - ending knee injury sustained in last friday 's home defeat by @entity127			0
the @entity128 beat the @entity3 16 - 0 at home in march but coach @entity130 , who is in talks over a new contract , admits the change of coach makes @entity3 dangerous opponents			1
' i am disappointed for @entity16 as a coach but when teams change coaches there always seems to be one or two weeks where they really up the ante , ' @entity130 said			1
' on paper they have a good squad and at their home ground they are always tough to play against so we are under no illusions			2

@entity2 admits they have a tough job on their hands
