' it may surprise some of you to know this is not the first time i 've sung on board a ship , ' mr @entity0 - aka rock god @entity0 - declared to an enraptured audience on the @entity9			1
' one of my first - ever jobs as a professional musician was on @entity13			0
' in the early 1970s i sang every night , until the ship 's purser told me i could no longer sing as i was upsetting some of the lady passengers			2
so the drummer ended up singing instead			0
that purser 's sorry now , i tell you ! ' an @entity20 in the port : @entity0 poses next to the @entity9 ahead of his recent appearance on board i was one of the privileged passengers to enjoy an hour - long audience with @entity0 in the liner 's @entity26			1
we were docked in the @entity29 - and never had the rock star 's ' @entity20 in @entity31 ' sounded so appropriate			1
it may indeed also surprise readers to know that an audience with @entity0 is now par for the course - or par for the cruise - when it comes to on - board entertainment across @entity40 's magnificent fleet			1
that 's especially true on @entity9 , with her stunning 1,150 - capacity theatre that rivals the best on @entity45			1
although @entity0 's performance was a one - off to showcase songs from his new @entity45 musical , @entity50 ( plus a few classic crowd - pleasers for good measure ) , the gig was a good example of the calibre of on - board entertainment now offered			1
you wo n't find any of those old cruise - line staples - obscure jazz artists , opera singers and tribute acts - on @entity40 's fleet today			1
you 're more likely to encounter music legends such as @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
rapper @entity67 has done a gig on one of the ships			2
in august this year , to celebrate @entity9 's tenth anniversary , @entity72 - winning @entity71 performed twice in the @entity26 during an eight - day transatlantic crossing			2
@entity71 's association with the ship began five years ago after he discovered the benefits of her sizeable hold			0
having been forced to delay a @entity81 tour after his band 's equipment was waylaid on a container ship , @entity71 realised he could enjoy the leisurely pace of travel on @entity9 safely accompanied by his instruments			1
' it 's a fascinating way to vacation , ' @entity71 said			0
' there 's something romantic about departing on a boat and seeing the water , and actually experiencing every nautical mile			0
' it sort of makes a connection to another time and place			0
' of course , @entity40 's liners have been attracting stars for many decades : photos showing @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 - to name but a few - enjoying @entity40 cruises are proudly displayed on @entity9			2
the nice thing for today 's stars is that the nature of the passengers on @entity40 cruises tends to mean they are largely left to their own devices and are not hounded for autographs or ' selfies '			0
and it 's not just a-list stars from the music world who are signing up to perform at sea			0
@entity9 has also been playing host to big names from @entity124 including @entity125 , actor @entity126 , and directors @entity127 and @entity129			1
next year , @entity40 will celebrate its 175th anniversary - meaning there 'll be more stars than ever adorning the fabulous fleet			0
@entity40 ( www.cunard.co.uk , 0843 374 0000 ) offers seven - and eight - night @entity135 crossings on queen mary 2 between may and october 2015			0
prices from Â£ 1,299 for a voyage from @entity139 to @entity31 , including return flight and transfers .			1
