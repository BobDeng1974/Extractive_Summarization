by @entity0 a young mother died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after being sent home by her gp with antibiotics to treat earache , an inquest has heard			2
tragic @entity9 , 28 , died last year after medics put her symptoms - including ear and head pain , and discharge from her left ear - down to a ‘ relatively minor ’ infection			1
but a coroner concluded that doctors could n’t have done any more to save the ‘ extremely unlucky ’ mother - of - three , who collapsed and died in @entity19 on march 21 last year			1
tragic mum @entity9 , 28 , who died from a large abscess on her brain six weeks after her gp treated her for an ear infection			1
doctors believe the infection spread from @entity9 ' ear to her brain despite being treated by a course of antibiotics the mother - of - three was seen by two further doctors who all agreed with the ear infection diagnosis because @entity9 did not show any symptoms alerting them to the killer brain bug a top ear , nose and throat surgeon , @entity34 , who carried out an investigation for the hospital into ms @entity9 ' death , told the inquest that there was around a one - in - 4,000 chance of an ear infection leading to a brain abscess			1
he said he was satisfied the hospital had taken all the steps possible to treat miss @entity9 and said by looking at her , no - one would have suspected she had a brain abscess			1
the court heard from medics - two doctors who had seen ms @entity9 in the weeks before her death and two nurses who had taken calls from her - who said ms @entity9 ’ symptoms were consistent with nothing more than an ear infection			1
a brain abscess is a rare and life - threatening condition caused when an infection travels from another part of the body to the brain			1
only three people per million will contract the deadly bug each year			0
with early diagnosis , nine out of ten patients are expected to survive			0
patients suffering a brain abscess often develop a headache which is so severe it is not helped by pain killers			1
the infection can often cause changes in a patient 's mental state and brings a fever with temperatures in excess of 38c a patient may also suffer seizures as the infection attacks the brain			0
a brain abscess can be caused by sinusitis and even a dental infection that attacks the brain			1
in some cases , a brain abscess can be caused by a serious head injury leading to a fractured skull allowing the infection to pass into the brain tissue			1
patients diagnosed with a brain abscess will be treated with anti-biotics , surgery and in some cases anti-fungals			2
the earlier a patient is treated , the less chance of long - term complications			0
patients can suffer from seizures and epilepsy source : @entity104 in fact , the mother - of - three had developed a middle ear infection which had led to a large 4cm abscess developing on the left side of her brain			1
the hearing was told the tragedy began on february 12 last year after @entity115 , from @entity116 , @entity112 went to see her gp dr @entity117 complaining of pains in her ear			0
the doctor examined her ear including the bone structure but thought the symptoms pointed to an outer ear infection			1
he prescribed her with antibiotics and asked her to come back in three weeks if she did not get any better			0
on march 1 miss @entity9 called a triage nurse working for the out - of - hours go to doc service saying her ear was ' very painful ' and was ' nine out of ten ' on the pain scale			1
she was referred to a doctor at an out - of - hours surgery based at @entity19 who thought it was an infection of the middle ear but prescribed antibiotics and advised her to come back in a few days if the pain persisted or became worse			2
on march 16 , miss @entity9 spoke to another out - of - hours nurse complaining of headache and earache and four days later she was admitted to hospital			0
the @entity112 hearing was told after her admission , she did not display signs of illness , such as high temperature or changed mental state , that could have prompted doctors to send her for a brain scan that might have discovered the abscess			0
although she was seen to be very distant the night before she died , that was put down to the pressures of coping with young children			0
she last seen alive going to the toilet at around 4am after being kept in hospital overnight			0
she died on the ward later that day			0
coroner @entity157 said @entity9 was ' incredibly unlucky ' saying the lack of other symptoms gave doctors little chance of diagnosing a brain abscess because of her ' robust constitution ' recording a verdict of death by natural causes , coroner @entity157 said the diagnosis of a " relatively minor " ear infection by dr @entity117 had been ' completely appropriate '			1
mr @entity157 said the out - of - hours service had taken a sensibly cautious approach to miss @entity9 ' condition and he thought they could not have done anymore to prevent her death			2
mr @entity157 said miss @entity9 did not display any normal signs of somebody with a cerebral abscess and added : ' @entity9 has just been extremely unlucky to contract this infection and to have a robust constitution			1
' he added : ' there was no evidence that her condition justified a ct scan			0
it would be unrealistic to expect that the hospital perform a ct scan on everybody who has a ear infection			2
' even if she was given a emergency ct scan the night she died then there is also no evidence to suggest she would have been able to be saved			0
' it is a very unfortunate series of events			0
the vast majority of people who have ear infections do n't have a cerebral abscess			0
she has been extremely unlucky to contract this infection			0
' he added : ' @entity9 has just been extremely unlucky to contract this infection and to have a robust constitution [ that meant doctors could not tell she had an abscess ]			2
' speaking afterwards , ms @entity9 ’ mum , @entity206 , said she accepted the verdict , adding : ' it ’s been a very , very hard time			2
my daughter was like me and had a very strong pain threshold			1
' brain abcesses are incredibly rare in @entity214 with most neurosurgeons expecting to treat at most four patients a year			0
friends of @entity9 took to @entity218 to pay tribute to the tragic mum - of - three who died after contracting the rare brain condition			2

medics believed @entity9 was only suffering a ' relatively minor ' ear infection
the mother - of - three had developed a 4cm brain abscess without showing clear symptoms
coroner @entity157 said ms @entity9 ' ' strong constitutions ' made diagnosis harder
mother claims @entity9 had a ' very strong pain threshold '
