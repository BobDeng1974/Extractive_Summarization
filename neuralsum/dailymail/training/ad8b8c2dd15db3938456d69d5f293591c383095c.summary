@entity0 will refuse to sell @entity1 to another @entity3 club , but @entity4 are favourites to land the midfielder if he manages to engineer a move away			1
the 31 - year - old 's future at the @entity8 is in doubt after a farcical episode on tuesday where his agent , @entity11 , insisted he wanted out after being treated like a ' nobody '			0
@entity1 went on to back up his representative 's claims and may leave the @entity17 champions this summer			2
ambition : toure has been linked with a return ' home ' to @entity22 after a lack of respect from @entity0 comments : @entity1 's agent @entity26 has been in the public eye over the last week having a look : @entity29 's @entity4 are favourites to sign @entity1 if he does leave the @entity8 the bizarre standoff derives from the @entity32 's birthday last week , where @entity11 claims he was n't handed a celebratory cake			1
@entity1 was in fact given two			0
@entity0 have kept their counsel up until now and will block any attempt to lever a move but @entity1 himself has confirmed that he wants out			2
@entity39 understands that @entity40 and @entity41 - the only domestic clubs to have the financial clout to prise him away - would think twice before making an offer given tuesday 's soap opera , while @entity0 would block any move regardless			0
but - if tensions do not dissipate - the club may have to cash in , particularly given the player 's age			0
the fact that @entity1 is coming towards his twilight years would not deter @entity29 's @entity4 , who remain intent on breaking into @entity55 's elite imminently and will stop at nothing to do so - even after @entity55 's recent @entity57 sanctions			2
@entity61 rivals @entity59 would join @entity62 and @entity22 in the race to sign @entity1 , who said that he wants to end his career at the @entity65			1
' yes , i have talked before about ending my career at @entity22 - but we do n't know because football is moving fast and you never know about tomorrow			0
' could it be ? @entity1 has indicated that he wants to end his career back at @entity22 , who sold him for Â£ 24m			1

@entity0 will refuse to allow @entity1 to leave to a domestic rival
if they do have to sell , @entity4 are favourites
@entity62 , @entity22 and @entity59 would also be *interested*
@entity1 says he wants to finish his career at @entity22
