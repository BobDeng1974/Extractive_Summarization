by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 , the charismatic and hard - charging @entity3 who has seen partisan pressure ratcheted up as he contemplates a run for the presidency , ignored his swirling abuse - of - power scandals tuesday as he began his second term as @entity10 's governor			1
he spoke only generally of a governing philosophy prefers substantive discussion to the hardscrabble slap - fests that make up much of @entity10 politics			0
' we can not fall victim to the attitude of @entity18 , ' he said , ' the attitude that says , " i am always right and you are always wrong , " the attitude that puts everyone into a box that they are not permitted to leave , the attitude that puts political victories ahead of policy agreements			1
' he also referred to his obligation as governor to deal head - on with controversy , speaking of ' solemn obligations to make the hard decisions , to raise the uncomfortable topics , to require responsibility and accountability , to be willing to stand hard when principles are being violated and to be willing to compromise to find common ground with all of our people			0
his administration was rocked with allegations that top officials arranged for new traffic patterns on the iconic @entity48 as a form of political payback against the @entity76 mayor of a nearby town			2
that gridlock was brought to mind tuesday as winter storms brought some traffic to a standstill and made many roads too treacherous to travel , causing @entity43 's team to cancel a planned post-inaugural party on @entity87			1
the irony of traffic concerns becoming great enough to inconvenience @entity43 loyalists while his office is under investigation for allegedly causing days of traffic chaos was n't lost on most observers			2
in addition to the ' @entity99 ' scandal , @entity43 's lieutenant governor @entity96 stands accused of threatening to withholding @entity50 reconstruction money from the mayor of @entity102 unless a commercial development that @entity43 favored was given a green light			1
@entity96 has forcefully denied the charges			0
she also received unwelcome attention on monday when nine - time olympic gold medalist @entity107 accused her of ending his political aspirations in 2011 when she was the state 's attorney general , striking him from a local ballot because he wanted to unseat a longtime @entity43 ally from the @entity112			1
@entity43 's day started with a service at @entity53 's @entity114 before a swearing in and address in @entity60			2
@entity43 ignored his own parade of scandals during his inaugural address as legislators and dignitaries watched			0
@entity122 ( first row , 5th from l ) , the new general assembly speaker , is expected to have his knives sharpened for @entity43 as investigations proceed @entity43 's planned post-inauguration celebration was called off because weather conditions on @entity87 were too treacherous for guests to travel there but organizers already canceled the evening party on @entity87 , a symbolic spot synonymous with the promise of the @entity1 , because snow promised to make travel dangerous			1
the island where some 12 million immigrants first entered the @entity1 is divided between @entity10 and @entity138 , but his party was supposed to be held in a hall on the @entity138 side			0
@entity143 prepared for the party will instead be donated to food pantries in the @entity147 area			0
money collected for the $ 500 tickets to the inaugural celebration , and other contributions , will be used to help support three charities : @entity153 , @entity114 and @entity154 , which was founded by first lady @entity155			0
@entity43 won re-election in november by a 22 - point margin over state sen. @entity158 , a @entity159			1
then : @entity43 started his term as the head of @entity10 after being elected in november 2009 ( pictured ) warm reception : this fall , @entity43 won his re-election in a 22 - point landslide the @entity3 governor built a national following as a blunt - talking and often funny politician who strove to show that he could find common ground with @entity76 on some key issues , including overhauling the state 's public - worker pension program and making it easier to fire underperforming teachers			1
@entity43 became a fixture in speculation about who would seek the 2016 presidential nomination with his leadership after @entity50 slammed into his state in october 2012			1
he worked with president @entity183 and took on @entity3 members of @entity185 who were reluctant to approve record levels of aid for storm victims , receiving high marks from his constituents and plentiful national attention			0
but his reputation has been battered since revelations this month that an appointee and a close aide appear to have ordered two of three approach lanes to the @entity48 from the town of @entity199 shut down for four days in september			0
the move was allegedly political retribution against mayor @entity202 for not endorsing @entity43 for re-election			2
the @entity1 attorney 's office and two state legislative committees are now investigating			0
in the spotlight : lt. governor @entity96 ( pictured with @entity43 today ) has been blamed in the latest scandal , but she denies ever having threatened to withhold @entity50 relief funds @entity107 , the legendary @entity210 sprinter and long - jumper and native @entity10 , has put lt. gov. @entity96 in the hot seat with claims that she ordered his name off an election ballot in 2011 in order to protect a sitting state senator who was close to gov. @entity43 @entity43 has apologized , denied any involvement with or knowledge of the plot and fired a deputy chief of staff at the center of the controversy			1
@entity43 's administration also faces an allegation from the @entity76 mayor of @entity102 that it tied the delivery of @entity50 aid to the low - lying city of 50,000 across from @entity230 to support for a prime real estate project			1
mayor @entity232 said she was told by @entity233 that the ultimatum came directly from @entity43			0
@entity96 strongly denied those claims monday and described them as ' false ' and ' illogical			0
' ' any suggestion that @entity50 funds were tied to the approval of any project in @entity10 is completely false , ' ms @entity96 said			2
in his re-election campaign , @entity43 did not make big new promises but said he would continue to work on recovery from @entity50 , seek tax cuts and push for other previous priorities with which the @entity159 - controlled @entity248 has not been willing to go along			2
@entity43 has not ruled out a 2016 presidential run and has taken a more visible role on the national stage after accepting the position as the head of the @entity254			1
he spent this weekend down in @entity256 , and was feted by billionaire @entity3 donor and @entity259 co-founder @entity258 who held a fundraiser in @entity43 â€™s honor .			0

' we can not fall victim to the attitude of @entity18 *...* that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements , ' @entity43 said
his second term begins amid investigations into his senior staff for ordering the manipulation of traffic patterns as political revenge
in an odd irony , @entity43 's post-inauguration party was canceled tuesday because of traffic caused by inclement weather
a *federal* *prosecutor* is investigating whether lt. gov. @entity96 held @entity50 relief funds *hostage* for a commercial development
@entity210 legend @entity107 now says @entity233 and @entity43 *torpedoed* his political career because he planned to run against a @entity43 ally
@entity43 is openly contemplating a 2016 presidential run and won his re-election in a 22 - point landslide before the scandal parade began
