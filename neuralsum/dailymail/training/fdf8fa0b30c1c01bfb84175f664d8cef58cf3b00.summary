by @entity0 in 2010 astronomers were baffled when they found a supernova 30 times brighter than it should have been			1
named @entity3 - 10afx it was identical to similar types of supernova save for its intense brightness , leaving scientists wondering if their models were wrong			1
but new observations suggest it may not have been a ‘ super-supernova ’ at all , but rather its brightness was magnified by a hidden lens galaxy that has now recently discovered			1
astronomers have revealed that a supernova 30 times brighter than it should have been may have been an illusion caused by a lens galaxy			1
pictured is a @entity26 - @entity25 - @entity24 ( @entity23 ) image of the field type 1a supernovas , caused when a large star transfers material to a white dwarf until it explodes , are useful tools for understanding the universe			2
this is because they have similar luminosities regardless of where they occur in the universe , meaning they can be used as ‘ distance markers ’			0
so when ps1 - 10afx was found to break those previous theories , it had astronomers worried they had been wrong about the supernovas			2
this particular supernova occurred nine billion light years away , and shone with an intensity of 100 billion suns			2
@entity48 : a white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes			0
non-standard type 1a : two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion			0
@entity57 : a star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out , causing it to explode			0
type 1b and 1c : a star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds			0
@entity70 : extreme type of supernova , 50 times as energetic as other supernovas , resulting in a black hole			1
the exact cause of them is unknown			0
in 2013 , scientists at @entity79 concluded it must be a type of new , significantly brighter class of supernova			1
but a new study in @entity84 suggests it is nothing more than an average supernova , amplified by an intervening galaxy			2
the study was carried out by a team of researchers led by @entity89 at the @entity90 ( @entity91 )			0
on analysis of the supernova , they were n’t so quick to agree with their compatriots at @entity79 that it was a super-supernova			0
‘ ps1 - 10afx looked a lot like a type 1a supernova , ’ says @entity89 , ‘ but it was just too bright			1
’ generally , when a supernova is found to be brighter than a regular type 1a supernova it is either hotter , appearing blue , or involves a much larger initial size			1
‘ new physics would thus be required to explain @entity98 as an intrinsically luminous supernova , ’ continues @entity89			2
the observed spectra of the lensing galaxy ( left ) and host galaxy containing the original supernova ( right ) , as measured by the @entity113 on the 10 - metre @entity115 - 1 telescope , suggesting that the lensing galaxy was responsible for the extreme brightness of the supernova instead , the scientists believed that it was nothing more than an illusion and that a hidden galaxy was altering what we were seeing			1
so in september 2013 they spent seven hours collecting light at the location of @entity98 using the @entity113 on the 10 - metre @entity115 - 1 telescope in @entity129 the glare of the galaxy containing @entity3 - 10afx they found another galaxy , much dimmer , but of the right size to cause the lensing effect			1
‘ this second galaxy was faint enough to have previously gone unnoticed , ’ says @entity135 more , astronomer at the @entity137			0
‘ but our analysis showed that it was still the right size to explain the gravitational lensing of @entity98			1
’ gravitational lensing occurs when a large , massive object like a galaxy bends the light of a distant source			1
the light from the distant source is gathered by the intervening galaxy and , when we finally see it on @entity150 , it appears amplified			2
the effect was first predicted by @entity153 ’s @entity152 – now , this discovery serves as another validation of the theory			0
gravitational lensing is an effect that occurs when a massive intervening object magnifies light from a distant source			1
the effect is highlighted by an ' @entity153 ring ' , pictured , where light is bent around a lensing object such lensing galaxies for @entity57 1a supernovas had been predicted before , but none had been found			2
however , this discovery could lead to similar lensing galaxies being found in future			2
‘ we had existing predictions of what a gravitationally lensed @entity48 would look like , ’ says @entity171 from the @entity172 at the @entity173			0
‘ but the small size of this lens galaxy and the large magnification it produced was not exactly what we were expecting for the first discovery			1
‘ however , this system may very well prove typical of discoveries to come			0
' because more distant supernovae are more likely to be gravitationally lensed , lensed supernovae are typically highly magnified and located in the distant universe			0
‘ our new approach allows us to find unresolved strong lensing events produced by such low - mass galaxies			0
‘ thus , the expected number of gravitationally lensed @entity48 supernovae to be found in future surveys increases by an order of magnitude			0

an extremely bright supernova *spotted* in 2010 may have been an illusion
@entity98 was *unusual* as it was 30 times brighter than similar explosions
this baffled astronomers and hinted at a new type of supernova
but new research has revealed that a hidden ' lens galaxy ' was in the way
through gravitational lensing this magnified the light of the supernova
the discovery was made with the @entity115 - 1 telescope in @entity217
