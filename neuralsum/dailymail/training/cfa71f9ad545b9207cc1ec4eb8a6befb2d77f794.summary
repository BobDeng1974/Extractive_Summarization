@entity123 conceded a corner and @entity73 got in front of @entity57 to head past @entity47 who had stayed rooted to his line			0

@entity2 tried to hit back immediately but @entity56 blasted over from a @entity23 pass and @entity57 was also wasteful			1

the match was still scrappy with @entity51 colliding with @entity77 and @entity69 going into the book for a foul on @entity23			0
@entity25 ’s free - kick was well saved by @entity139			0
the next important foul would be inside in the area and would give @entity2 a way back into the game			2

@entity2 should have extended their lead but @entity57 ’s header was saved at point - blank range from @entity66			2
@entity5 had faded badly towards the end of the first period and when @entity77 clattered his former @entity152 team - mate @entity54 he became the third @entity5 player to be booked			0

neither side got into their stride and it was @entity5 who made the first change with @entity29 coming on for @entity72 but it was not long before @entity58 was stripping off and replacing @entity57			2
@entity56 headed a @entity23 cross over but still both sides huffed and puffed with limited end product – maybe a symptom of having played each other seven times now this calendar year			0
@entity25 was the next to make way with @entity55 replacing him			0
but the midfielder ’s first effort was a curling shot that floated harmlessly wide			0
far closer was @entity29 ’s shot at the other end after he was shown inside			0
