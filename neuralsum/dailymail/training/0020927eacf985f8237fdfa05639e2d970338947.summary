@entity0 claimed it would not be a failure if his @entity4 team finish second in the @entity5 this season , despite being title favourites and having spent £ 75million in the transfer market			1
but @entity0 needs only take a look at @entity4 's recent history - including his own past - to know that @entity11 has sacked every one of his managers who have finished second in the league			1
@entity0 has every reason to be confident despite losing out to @entity15 on his return to @entity17 last season - the @entity18 has won the league at every major club he has managed in his second season , including at @entity4 in his first spell at the club			1
@entity0 in 2007 ( his third season at the helm ) , @entity34 in 2008 and @entity37 in 2011 all finished second but lost their jobs soon after			2
@entity35 , @entity39 and @entity40 never even got the chance to complete a full @entity5 season before getting the chop , while temporary bosses @entity36 and @entity41 were not retained as @entity4 finished well off the title pace			1
@entity0 already has some catching up to do			0
the @entity57 kick off their title bid at @entity29 on monday night having seen rivals @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity15 secure opening wins , although @entity63 lost in @entity65 's first league match in charge			1
@entity0 claimed that he could consider this season to be a success even if @entity4 do not claim a first title since 2010			1
‘ it ’s the only league in the world where four , five or six clubs are title contenders , ' he said in the build - up to monday night 's match			2
' only one can win			0
do the other five fail ? i do n’t think so			0
cheerio : @entity33 ( left ) and @entity37 ( right ) were sacked after finishing second in the league ‘ one view is that one succeeded and five failed			0
another view is that three , four or five did fantastically but only one won			0
’ @entity0 has won the title in his second season at every major club : @entity85 ( 2004 ) @entity4 ( 2006 ) @entity86 ( 2010 ) @entity87 ( 2012 ) @entity0 has won the title in his second season at every club he has managed for more than one year : @entity85 , @entity4 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
‘ this is the second year of my project and i am so happy with that , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ at the end of the season you , the supporters and the players will judge my work			0
and most importantly my boss , my owner , my board will judge			0
’ @entity0 is right - @entity11 certainly will judge him			2
glory : @entity0 won the title in his second season at @entity4 in 2006 - but can he repeat the trick ? reign in spain : @entity0 enjoyed @entity108 success in his second season at @entity87 @entity4 are title contenders - @entity0			2

@entity0 claimed it would not be failure if @entity4 do not win @entity5 title this season
@entity15 , @entity63 , @entity61 and @entity60 all expected to mount *challenges* this term
@entity4 start season at @entity29 on monday night
@entity11 has sacked every @entity4 manager who has not delivered the title
