by @entity0 the aunt of @entity3 leader @entity2 has mysteriously disappeared from a re-run of a propaganda film , leading to speculation that she has been purged - or even executed			1
@entity8 , 67 , is the widow of @entity9 , who was recently executed , and while it was believed she would always remain ' safe ' under her nephew 's brutal regime , analysts say that her disappearance from the documentary is ominous			1
ms @entity2 was frequently seen at the side of her nephew and his wife at public events until january this year , when her last public appearance was in the documentary shown on @entity21			2
gone : in the original film , above , @entity8 could be seen but just a few months later the scene was replaced with one that did n't feature the widow in that footage , aired in january , she was seen walking with the leader and his wife towards the @entity29 in the capital , @entity31 , to pay tribute to the embalmed bodies of former leaders @entity35 - sung and @entity36			1
ms @entity2 's safety from purging or execution had always been assumed because she is the daughter of @entity3 founder @entity40 - sun and the sister of the late leader , @entity36			2
her role in recent times has been as secretary for organization of the @entity46			0
while she has been frequently seen close to @entity2 at a number of public events , her apparent deliberate disappearance from a run - run of the original documentary suggests to observers that she might never be seen again			0
@entity55 's @entity54 newspaper , which has good sources among @entity3 watchers , reported that since the original screening featuring ms @entity2 , a re-run shown on tuesday depicts a scene in which only @entity2 , his wife , and male military officials are visible			2
' it seems that @entity8 stepped down from major positions in the party , but we need additional verification to see whether she was ousted , ' the paper quoted a @entity70 in @entity71 as saying			1
edited out : @entity8 , left , is the widow of party member @entity9 , who was executed last year ms @entity2 was seen ' in the flesh ' at a public concert in september last year and , while her name was later among top officials at a committee organizing the state funeral of a senior @entity46 official , she did not make an appearance			1
that led to rumors that she had died or was seriously ill , but then she appeared in the first showing of the tv documentary in january			0
despite her perceived protection as a direct descendant of nation founder @entity87 , ms @entity2 is still associated with a husband who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed in december			1
after his execution , direct family members were said to have been shot dead and other relatives were sentenced to labor camps			0
among those killed , reportedly on @entity2 's orders , were @entity3 's ambassadors to @entity97 and @entity98			0
the apparent ' disappearance ' of miss @entity2 has led to speculation that her place in high positions in the @entity46 has been taken by @entity2 's younger sister , @entity104 .			0

concerns widow may have suffered same fate as her husband who was executed last year
scenes featuring @entity8 have been replaced just a few months after show first aired
