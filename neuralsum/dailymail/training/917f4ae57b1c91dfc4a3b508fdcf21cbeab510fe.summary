he said he trusted his @entity203 colleagues @entity47 and @entity131			0
' if you are going to be disloyal to someone , you should front them , ' mr @entity188 said			0

' there will always be a third of the party room that are upset about one thing or another , ' he said			0
the treasurer rejected media reports that he could lose his job in a compromise to head off the leadership spill			2
' i think everyone should do the jobs they have and properly serve the @entity101 people , not engage in commentary on gossip			0
' mr @entity188 stood by the government 's controversial decisions to overhaul @entity226 , higher education , pensions and welfare , which have contributed to the leadership unrest			2
' we have no choice , ' he said of the budget changes			0
@entity71 mp @entity234 , 24 , has also declared that he will vote in favour of the motion to spill the leadership of the government			2
@entity234 ( left ) is pictured with @entity0 in 2010 communications minister @entity47 welcomed foreign minister @entity131 to @entity156 on sunday mr @entity47 has only voiced his opposition to mr @entity0 moving the vote forward , labelling it a ' captain 's call ' - what the prime minister has dubbed some of his less popular decisions , including knighting prince @entity94			1
mr @entity47 said anyone was in a position to contest the leadership without being disloyal			2
' if , for whatever reason , the leadership of a political party is vacant then any member of the party can stand , whether they be a minister or a backbencher , without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant , ' he said outside his home on sunday			0
on sunday mr @entity0 said he wanted to deal with the spill line ' as quickly as possible ' so the @entity4 can put the matter behind them			1
' the only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the @entity108 in dragging down a first term prime minister , ' he said			0
' now obviously i 've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up @entity108 's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve			0
' @entity47 has refused to deny he will challenge the prime minister for leadership of the @entity4 , and said if anyone stands for a vacant position that does not mean they are disrespecting the person whose leadership has been declared vacant @entity47 refused to say if he will run for the leadership but maintains he supports mr @entity0 in line with cabinet solidarity as prime minister @entity0 battles to secure the backing of his own party members amidst next week 's leadership spill motion , a new @entity285 poll has revealed that 55 per cent of voters want him to stand down as reports that @entity47 will contest the leadership continue to circulate , the poll showed he would improve the @entity4 's chance of winning at the next election if he were made prime minister foreign minister @entity131 is also preferred as leader when measured up against mr @entity0 , but still not as much as a @entity108 government according to the 53:47 two - party preferred vote focused on her taking the top spot there may be some hope yet for mr @entity0 , as sources reveal mr @entity47 would offer him his support on tuesday if he were to be promised the role of @entity306 , dumping @entity188 ( pictured ) from the position the communications minister took to @entity309 this week to deny he was in secret meetings with deputy leader @entity131 he also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so he will take that as an endorsement of his leadership ms @entity131 said as mr @entity0 's deputy , she supported the prime minister @entity317 , pictured with potential leadership contender @entity47 , has announced he will move for a federal @entity4 leadership spill			1

prime minister @entity0 says today 's leadership vote was ' a very chastening experience '
he has promised that ' good government starts today '
he survived a leadership spill motion , though he is *weakened* after a majority of backbenchers voted for a spill
failure of the spill motion meant @entity47 did not have a chance to challenge mr @entity0 's leadership
