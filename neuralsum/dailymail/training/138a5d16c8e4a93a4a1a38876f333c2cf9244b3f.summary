by @entity0 one of sgt @entity3 's captors lost a son in a @entity7 drone strike in an incident that has intriguing similarities with the hit @entity10 , it was revealed today			1
four years ago , in an untelevised speech at an @entity14 fundraiser , @entity3 's father , @entity11 , made an unusual request of his audience			1
the grieving father asked attendees of the event to say a prayer for the head of the terrorist network he believed was holding his son hostage			1
prayer : bob @entity3 ( with wife @entity26 ) made a speech making the drone claim and asked the audience to say a prayer for the terrorist holding his son hostage ' the man who we believe holds @entity3 grew up on the lap of his mother learning the @entity37			1
he is a powerful man , ' @entity3 said , according to a reporter there			1
' we pray for him			0
he recently lost a son to a @entity7 missile drone strike			1
the fact that he did n't kill @entity43 right then is incredible			0
so we pray for him			0
' the man @entity44 spoke of was @entity45 – leader of the @entity47 terrorist network			2
earlier that year , family members of @entity47 were allegedly killed in a @entity50 drone strike intended for the @entity52 commander			1
according to a secret report created by the @entity56 government that was obtained and published by the @entity57 earlier this year , 19 missiles were fired in the february 2 , 2010 , attack and at least 23 people were killed			1
@entity60 ran a report on the day of the strike confirming that 29 people total were killed in drone strikes that day in @entity56			2
that report made no mention of @entity45 ’s home being hit , but @entity60 did quote an anonymous source as saying that @entity45 was indeed the target of the drone strikes			2
a year and a half later , hit series @entity10 would embark on a plotline eerily similar to the one in the story told by @entity3 ’s father at the @entity14 event in june of 2010			1
in an episode revealing why marine sgt @entity76 ( played by @entity78 ) became a terrorist after he was captured and tortured for eight years by @entity81 leader @entity80 in @entity82 , @entity76 is brainwashed and becomes a devotee of @entity80 and @entity84			1
echoes : the incident has similarities with the plot from @entity10 , in which sgt @entity76 turns terrorist after the son of his captor is blown up in a @entity7 drone strike @entity80 takes him back to his home , and asks him to teach his son @entity94 how to speak @entity95			1
@entity76 falls in love with @entity94 , and , in shocking scene , witnesses the brutal death of @entity94 and eighty other children at his madrassa			1
after this , @entity76 returns to the @entity50 determined to seek revenge for @entity94 's death			1
@entity3 had written home before he was captured in 2009 about how deeply effected he was that his brothers in arms were not bothered when they ran over a young @entity82 child in an armored car			2
in may of 2011 @entity44 posted a video to @entity111 thanking the @entity52 for keeping his son safe			2
' strangely to some , we must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years			2
we know our son is a prisoner and also a guest in your home , ' he said			0
while his son was gone , @entity44 reportedly studied radical @entity84 politics , the @entity3 family ’s former pastor told the @entity122 , and he kept a beard like the ones adorned by @entity3 ’s captors			1
@entity3 says he grew the lengthy beard to remind people how long his son had been gone , but skeptics believe the patriarch might have had an ulterior motive for keeping his facial hair long			2
a few days before @entity3 's release , @entity11 , sent the following tweet to a website that claims to be the ‘ @entity135 ’ : ‘ i am still working to free all @entity137 prisoners			1
@entity138 will repay for the death of every @entity82 child , ameen			0
’ the tweet has since been deleted			0
in a video posted by the @entity142 on the weekend his son was released , @entity11 said he was just ' a father who wants his son back			1
’ his critics say he ’s taken it too far , though			0
friends of the @entity3 ’s worry that @entity11 may even have developed some sort of @entity149 , @entity145 said			1
meanwhile , @entity150 reported on thursday that @entity3 was more than just a prisoner in a @entity52 commander ’s home			2
according to documents based on eyewitness accounts that were obtained by @entity150 , after an initial period of harsh treatment , @entity3 became a @entity52 confidant and converted to @entity84 and jihadism while in captivity			1
' @entity3 enjoys a modicum of freedom , and engages in target practice with the local mujahedeen , firing @entity165			2
@entity3 is even allowed to carry a loaded gun on occasion , ' the report claims , according to @entity150			0
' @entity3 plays soccer with his guards and bounds around the pitch like a mad man , ' it continues			2
' he appears to be well and happy , and has a noticeable habit of laughing frequently and saying " salaam " repeatedly			0
' @entity176 means ' peace '			0
at that time , @entity3 was being held in @entity56 by @entity47 commander @entity179 or men who are close to him , the report says			0
not @entity45 himself , as @entity44 claimed			0
claims : deputy national security adviser @entity183 today said that trying @entity3 in the court of public opinion was ' repugnant ' before he could defend himself			0
it followed reports that the pow had converted to @entity84 and even declared ' jihad ' while in captivity a retired @entity190 who served as @entity193 commander for two years when @entity3 was being held prisoner said the claims made in the documents were not true , though			1
' we were always looking for actionable intelligence , ' he said , referring to the military and the intelligence community			0
' there was never any evidence of collaboration			0
' meanwhile , deputy national security adviser @entity183 said trying @entity3 in the court of public opinion was ' repugnant ' , @entity204 reported			0
he said ' we have seen no evidence ' of the claims that @entity3 converted or declared jihad , adding : ' the idea that we are trying sergeant @entity3 in the court of public opinion in absentia , without giving him an opportunity to give his story and to tell us what happened , frankly , i find repugnant '			1
@entity183 concluded : ' we do n't know what happened			0
we are determined to get to the bottom of it			0
the military will investigate appropriately			0
let 's get the facts before we rush to judgment			0

a story told four years ago by sgt. @entity227 's father about his son 's captor is eerily similar to a plotline in @entity231
at an @entity14 fundraiser in june 2010 @entity44 asked an audience to pray for the man holding @entity3 hostage
that man 's son , @entity11 said , was killed in a @entity50 drone strike earlier that year
a year and a half later , the @entity10 hit @entity10 would air an episode in which former pow and @entity245 sgt. @entity76 is revealed to have ' turned ' against his country after his captor 's son , @entity94 , was killed in a drone strike
@entity76 converted to @entity84 and took up jihadism after @entity94 's death
there have been *conflicting* reports on whether @entity3 has done the same
