' @entity97 said that the experts who examined the gun did not find enough evidence to prove @entity11 's involvement			1
' due to insufficient corresponding individual microscopic characteristics , all three experts found that they could not conclusively determine that any of the six bullets were or were not fired through the same firearm or that they were fired through the firearm recovered from ( @entity11 's home ) , ' the motion continues			1
' the only potential evidence that has ever been available to the @entity159 to prove that the @entity160 committed the murders of @entity162 and @entity163 depends upon an absolute , conclusive determination that the bullets recovered from their bodies were in fact fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from the ( @entity11 's ) home , ' the motionsays			1
' based on the microscopic comparisons and conclusions of all three of the @entity129 firearms and tool mark identification experts , the @entity159 does not have sufficient evidence to warrant further prosecution of these cases			0
