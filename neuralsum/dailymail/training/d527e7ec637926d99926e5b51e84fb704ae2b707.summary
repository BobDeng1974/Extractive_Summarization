by @entity1 reporter published : 19:42 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 02:41 est , 31 may 2013 astronauts traveling to and from @entity4 would be bombarded with as much cosmic radiation as they would get from a full - body ct scan about once a week for a year , researchers predict			0
that dose is enough to raise their cancer risk by about three per cent , but experts caution that there are many uncertainties about the space environment 's effects on the body			1
as plans for deep space exploration ramp up , radiation is a big concern - from high - energy galactic cosmic rays spewed by distant supernova explosions to sporadic bursts of charged particles hurled by the sun. destination mars : an artist 's impression of @entity29 's @entity28 capsule in orbit			1
astronauts traveling to the red planet will be exposed to high levels of radiation , raising their cancer risk considerably , researchers predict @entity37 's magnetic field helps to deflect much of that harmful radiation			1
the @entity40 space agency , @entity29 , aims to send a crew to orbit the red planet by the mid- 2030s			2
private outfits like @entity45 - backed by @entity29 engineer - turned - space tourist @entity46 - are seeking volunteers for a @entity4 flight			2
there have been previous efforts to gauge the radiation risk for future @entity4 travelers , but the best estimate is coming from @entity29 's @entity55 mission			1
tucked inside the rover when it launched in 2011 was a radiation sensor that took readings during the 8 1/2 - month cruise to @entity4			0

@entity29 engineers are testing propulsion systems and researching ways to reduce radiation exposure on a @entity4 flight artist 's rendering : the @entity28 - or @entity28 ( @entity71 ) - can be seen in the centre of this vision of a possible mission to @entity4 from those figures , scientists calculated a spacefarer 's radiation exposure for a quicker six - month voyage in a similarly shielded spacecraft			1
a roundtrip equates to about 662 millisieverts			0
that 's a sizable chunk of an astronaut 's career cap of 1,000 millisieverts which many international space agencies use to limit the accumulated radiation dosage in space			2
the dose is similar to getting a full - body ct scan every five or six days , said lead researcher @entity90 of the @entity91 in @entity92			0
the estimate does n't include time spent on the @entity4 surface			0

@entity29 , aims to send a crew to orbit the red planet by the mid- 2030s pressure shell : @entity29 's new @entity28 spacecraft in construction at @entity106			1
it is being packed with avionics , instrumentation an flight computers taking shape : the @entity28 , which mimics the classic conical shape of the @entity112 mission crew capsules , is one of the most advanced craft ever built the analysis appears in friday 's issue of the journal @entity118			2
the amount of radiation likely wo n't change unless there 's a rocket engine that can speed up the interplanetary ride , researchers said			0
' you want to get there as quickly as possible ' to reduce radiation exposure , said @entity128 , scientist in charge of the radiation instrument aboard @entity55			1
the radiation dose on a @entity4 trip would be higher than what crew members inside the @entity63 typically face - about 200 millisieverts per year			0
by contrast , people on @entity37 are typically exposed to about 3 millisieverts a year			0
@entity55 flew to @entity4 during a period of low to moderate solar activity			0
a manned mission that launches during a solar flare or storm would encounter more radiation			0
@entity29 engineers are testing propulsion systems and researching ways to reduce radiation exposure on a @entity4 flight			1

' before we can send astronauts there , we need to understand the environments and hazards that they would face , ' said @entity170 , deputy director of advanced exploration systems at @entity29 headquarters			0
since landing near the @entity4 equator last summer , @entity55 has continued to track radiation as it rolls across the dusty surface toward its eventual mountain destination			1
the rover has turned up the best evidence yet of an ancient watery @entity4 .			0

dose is enough to raise their cancer risk by about three per cent
new estimate of radiation risk is coming from @entity29 's @entity55 mission
@entity29 engineers are now researching ways to reduce radiation exposure
