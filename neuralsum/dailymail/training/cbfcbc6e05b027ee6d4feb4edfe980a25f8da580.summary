an iron deficiency during pregnancy increases the risk of giving birth to a child with autism - with the risk increasing for older mothers			1
those who have children with autism are significantly less likely to report taking iron supplements before and during their pregnancies than the mothers of children who are developing normally , @entity9 researchers found			1
the risk of the child being born with autism - found to be associated with an iron deficiency - was five times greater when the mother was also 35 or older at the time of the child 's birth			1
it also increases if a mother suffers from a condition such as obesity , hypertension or diabetes			1
there is an association between low intake of iron during pregnancy and the risk of having a child with autism spectrum disorder ( @entity36 ) - with the risk increasing fivefold for mothers aged 35 or older or who suffered from obesity , hypertension or diabetes , @entity9 researchers found			1
iron deficiency , or anaemia as it is known , is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in the number of red blood cells			0
@entity51 is used to produce red blood cells , which help store and carry oxygen in the blood			0
if you have fewer red blood cells than is normal , your organs and tissues will not get as much oxygen as they usually would			0
researchers said that iron is crucial in the development of a foetus ' brain , meaning a deficiency in this vitamin could lead to autism			1
the study , from researchers at the @entity70 , was the first to examine the relationship between maternal iron intake and having a child with autism spectrum disorder ( @entity36 )			1
previous research from the same @entity70 reported that taking supplementary folic acid was associated with a reduced risk for @entity36			0
@entity78 , assistant professor in the @entity79 , said : ' the association between lower maternal iron intake and increased @entity36 risk was strongest during breastfeeding , after adjustment for folic acid intake			1
she added : ' further , the risk associated with low maternal iron intake was much greater when the mother was also older and had metabolic conditions during her pregnancy			1
' women with 14.8mg a day for women if you are pregnant and you are short of iron , you â€™ll probably get very tired and may suffer from anaemia			1
if the iron level in your blood becomes low , your gp or midwife will advise you to take iron supplements			2
good sources of iron include : dark - green leafy vegetables , such as watercress and curly kale iron - fortified cereals or bread brown rice pulses and beans nuts and seeds meat , fish and tofu eggs dried fruit , such as dried apricots , prunes and raisins although liver is a good source of iron , do not eat it if you are pregnant			2
this is because it is also rich in vitamin a , which can damage your unborn baby in large amounts			0
source : @entity131 the study looked at pairs of mothers and children who were enrolled in the @entity137 - based @entity136 ( @entity139 ) study between 2002 and 2009			2
this included mothers of children with autism and 346 mothers of children or of typical development , who were n't considered to have @entity36			2
the researchers examined maternal iron intake , including vitamins , other nutritional supplements , and breakfast cereals during the three months prior to the birth through the end of the women 's pregnancies and breastfeeding			1
professor @entity78 said : ' iron deficiency , and its resultant anaemia , is the most common nutrient deficiency , especially during pregnancy , affecting 40 to 50 per cent of women and their infants			2
' @entity51 is crucial to early brain development , contributing to neurotransmitter production , myelination and immune function			1
' all three of these pathways have been associated with autism			0
' iron deficiency is pretty common , and even more common among women with metabolic conditions			2
' however we want to be cautious and wait until this study has been replicated			0
' in the meantime the takeaway message for women is do what your doctor recommends			0
' take vitamins throughout pregnancy , and take the recommended daily dosage			0
if there are side effects , talk to your doctor about how to address them			0
' for fertile women the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia are heavy periods and the pregnancy itself , as their body needs extra iron for their baby			0
dark - green leafy vegetables , such as spinach , watercress and curly kale are good sources of iron			0

mothers of children with autism were more likely to report low iron intake
risk *due* to low iron intake increased fivefold if the mother was 35 or over
increased risk if the mother suffered obesity , hypertension or diabetes
iron crucial for brain development of a growing foetus
@entity131 recommends 14.8mg a day for women
doctors might recommend supplements for pregnant women deficient
