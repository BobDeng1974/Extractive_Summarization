we see them grow up and this is the son of @entity3 , no doubt about it , and we call him @entity2			2

' he walks into my garden , just like mr @entity3 used to , and we spar			1
he walks up to me with his wings out just like his dad did			0
' he 's not attacking the boats at the moment , but maybe that 's because they did not have any young this year			0
he 's still a young - un himself			0
