by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 9 march 2012 updated : 11:53 est , 9 march 2012 a @entity2 soldier has been jailed for four years in @entity3 for raping a @entity2 university student in the popular tourist resort of @entity6 last summer			1
private @entity7 , 25 , showed little emotion as the criminal court in @entity10 passed sentence today			1
rape carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment in @entity3			1
( file picture ) : soldier @entity7 punched his 22 - year - old victim in the face and sexually assaulted her outside a block of hotel apartments in @entity6 but the judge decided to show ' maximum leniency ' after @entity7 ’s lawyer argued earlier this week that his client was ' a very successful soldier ' who had served in @entity24 and had no previous criminal record			1
dressed in black trousers and a white shirt , @entity7 left the small courtroom flanked by policemen to begin his sentence 30 miles away in @entity3 ’s only prison in the capital , @entity33			1
at the time of his crime @entity7 was not stationed on the island but visiting on a training exercise with the @entity38 , the @entity39			1
@entity3 is home to two sprawling sovereign military @entity2 bases			1
the name of his 22 - year - old victim , who was on holiday in @entity6 , has not been released			1
during his trial the court heard that he struck her in the face and then sexually assaulted her outside a block of hotel apartments on july 1 last year after walking her home from a nightclub			2
he fled the scene when three women from the block ran outside to investigate after hearing the victim ’s desperate screams			2
a state pathologist and gynaecologist who examined the student said there was sufficient evidence to suggest she had been raped			2
dna samples from @entity7 were also found on her clothes			2
he was arrested a day after the attack when his victim identified him in a police line - up			2
his sentence includes the nine months he has spent in custody since then			0
it is understood to be the most serious charge against a @entity2 soldier on the @entity74 holiday island since 1994			1
in september that year three off - duty squaddies stationed in @entity3 abducted and brutally killed a young @entity77 tour guide in @entity6			0
they were also convicted of conspiring to rape @entity79 , 23			0
prison : @entity7 has spent the last nine months at @entity33 central prisons			0
he has been jailed for four years the trio received life sentences that were reduced to 25 years on appeal and were released a few years ago			0
@entity33 central prisons – where @entity7 has spent the last nine months – were built by the island ’s former @entity2 colonial master at the end of the @entity88			1
his trial , which began in november , received little publicity in the local press			0
violent crime is rare in @entity3			0
after @entity79 ’s killing nearly two decades ago , the @entity94 ’s top brass on the island cracked down heavily on off - duty drinking and boorish behaviour			1
as a result , @entity2 forces in @entity3 have not been plagued by bad publicity for many years			0
the strategically - located military bases are unpopular with @entity103 @entity3 who see them as colonial footprints			0
@entity7 ’s conviction means he will automatically be dishonorably discharged from the @entity94			0
' we do not comment on individual cases , ” said a @entity2 military spokesman said			0
but ' all those who are found to fall short of the @entity94 ’s high standard or who are found to have committed an offence under the @entity114 will be dealt with administratively , up to and including discharge ” , he told @entity116 .			0

most serious charge against a soldier on the @entity74 holiday island since 1994
