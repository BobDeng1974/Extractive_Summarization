@entity0 thanked his lucky stars for goal - line technology after @entity4 ’s win over @entity5 – and revealed that his match - saving block from @entity7 came off his backside			1
@entity0 somehow got in the way of @entity7 ’s last - gasp shot deep into added time to preserve @entity4 ’s 2 - 1 win at @entity12 on tuesday night			1

he was n’t and we managed to hold on for the win , so thank @entity27 for goal - line technology			1
@entity7 had the shot and i think it came off my bum and went the other way			1
it was just a reaction for me to turn around and run in that direction			0
i saw it fall to @entity45 and it was just a reaction to stick my leg out and hope for the best			0
‘ luckily for me i cleared it , but i felt we were the team that could have got more goals			2
it was n’t meant to be but we stand here now with the three points and we are looking forward to the next game			2

it was a nervy last 10 or 15 minutes , but we created chances in the second after scoring the second goal , and i thought we could have finished those chances off			0
it was n’t meant to be and then we had to resilient in defence			0
‘ @entity59 has pulled off a great save and i cleared one off the line which was literally on the line , so it was nice to get the three points			0
