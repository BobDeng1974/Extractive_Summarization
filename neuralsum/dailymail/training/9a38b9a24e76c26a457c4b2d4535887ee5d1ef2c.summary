the @entity13 's @entity12 allows people to step into a cow 's hooves for a surreal experience			1
the hi - tech computer software subjects humans to being virtually poked with cattle prods and eventually dragged to a virtual slaughterhouse			1
researcher @entity22 hopes that participants find the experience so moving that they emphathise with the cattle and choose to eat less meat as a result			1
the thinking behind the project is that you remember what it is like to face being taken to slaughterhouse , even in a virtual world			2
and as a result , you might choose a vegetarian dish for dinner			0
the implications of such an experience are huge as eating less meat translates into less energy consumption , @entity38 reported			0
as well as turning people vegetarian , the researchers hope that the experience will also make participants think about how their behaviour on a daily basis contributes towards climate change			2
it is not the first time the researchers have used virtual reality technology to make people aware of their impact on the environment			1
individuals who virtually cut down trees said they thought about the experience later and reduced their paper usage			0
the @entity12 is designed to ' harness the emotive power of empathy ' and although it uses modern technology , the theory is not new			0
animal groups have previously used many tactics to create emotional understanding between humans and the animals they eat			0
on the simplest level , leaflets are designed to match pictures of beguiling animals with shocking facts that tug on the heartstrings			0
but still images and statistics have a relatively short - term effect , according to the researchers			0
the @entity13 's @entity12 subjects humans to being virtually poked with cattle prods and eventually dragged to a virtual slaughterhouse like some real cows it is thought that animal sanctuaries are much more successful as they not only rescue farm animals , but encourage people to interact with them			1
the sanctuaries hope that as people interact with the animals , they might recognise them as individuals with personalities , not just meat and change their actions			2
the same is true with this latest experiment			0
the scientists said that becoming the animals in a virtual world and stepping into their hooves was a natural extension of this idea and a new way of encouraging people to empathise .			1

@entity3 scientists are giving people the chance to step into a cow 's hooves using immersive virtual reality programmes
participants in the study are poked with virtual cattle prods before being taken to realistic - looking slaughterhouses
the @entity13 's aim is to get people to empathise with cows and as a result eat less meat
