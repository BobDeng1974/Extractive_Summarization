the collapse of @entity2 's civilisation is often used as a cautionary tale to show the folly of humans who over-exploit their surroundings			1
but a group of leading @entity9 scientists now believe the tale - which documents how the population collapsed due to deforestation - is completely false and ' misleading '			1
legend says the island 's landscape was washed away by the destruction of the palm forests , which ruined the fertile soil and forced the population to descend into cannibalism			1
a group of leading @entity9 scientists says that the tale about @entity2 's demise due to deforestation and cannibalism is completely false and ' misleading ' but research published yesterday says the population was actually decimated by the arrival of @entity29 - who brought syphilis , smallpox and slavery onto the land			1
the scientists believe that many inhabitants survived perfectly well after the final tree was cut down , which goes against the wide belief that the island 's inhabitants caused their own downfall			1
the academics reached their conclusion by looking at tools used by the islanders for farming , which were scattered around the land			0
they found that , instead of there being a sudden collapse in farming , there was a much more gradual decline in some areas			2
the findings by the @entity54 have now been published in the @entity55			0
the study will come as welcome news to the @entity2 - the indigenous name for the islanders - who have never been keen on the narrative about how their own stupidity ruined @entity2			2
@entity2 is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world , more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of @entity66 and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island speaking about the concept of ' collapse ' , professor @entity70 - who was not directly involved in the study - told @entity72 : ' it is a terrible presumption to say there was a food shortage			1
' she added : ' starvation is not an automatic result of tree removal and neither is warfare			0
' @entity2 is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world , more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of @entity66 and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island			0
yet the main belief is that it is thought that shortly before 1200 ad , @entity84 sailed to the island and began to settle there			0
the population on the island grew quickly as settlements were formed , thriving for hundreds of years			1
some scientists estimate that at its height , @entity2 's population may have been as much as 20,000 people			1
some experts believe the fertile land allowed the population time to develop a rich culture and gave them time to carve the distinctive moai stone heads that the island is now famous for			2
around 1200 ad , the inhabitants apparently began cutting down the island 's subtropical trees and giant palms in large numbers to build canoes and to transport the giant stone statues			0
however , the destruction of the palm forests that covered the island led to much of the fertile soil washing away , damaging the natural wildlife			0
that 's when people began to starve			0
in a last ditch effort at survival , they became cannibals			0
legend says that the collapse of the island 's ecology and civilization was so complete that by the time the @entity121 arrived in the 1700s , @entity2 was a sandy grassland void of nearly all its native wildlife			2
its human inhabitants were reduced to a starving population of 3,000 or less , scientists say .			2

legend says island washed away due to deforestation and cannibalism
but @entity9 researchers say the cautionary tale is false and ' misleading '
scientists believe population wiped out by syphilis , smallpox and slavery
study found many survived perfectly well after final tree was cut down
