adorable : eight - month - old @entity14 wearing her @entity6 christening gown at her home in @entity17 heirloom : the gown has been worn by at least 17 relations including @entity8 's mother @entity21 , 35 the bespoke cotton gown has also been lent out over the years to other relatives and friends who could n’t afford their own and is still in remarkably good condition			1
last month it was @entity8 ’s turn to don the garment as it became the centrepiece of yet another family christening in @entity32 , @entity33			1
the tiny baby followed in the footsteps of her mother , @entity36 , 35 , who wore the gown when she was baptised at the local church in 1978			2
among those looking on was @entity41 ’s grandmother @entity40 , 59 , and great grandmother @entity42 , 81 , who were also christened in the heirloom			0
@entity36 said : ' we ’ve had so many family members wear the gown it ’s become very special			2
both myself and my brother wore it , as well as quite a few cousins			0
early outing : @entity41 's @entity53 holding her uncle , @entity54 , in the gown at his 1970s christening family affair : @entity41 's great grandfather @entity59 , left , with relations holding second cousin @entity61 ' we had four generations of my family at the christening including my mum and grandmother who both wore the same dress at the same church			1
' i would n’t have had @entity8 dressed in anything else - it holds such sentimental value and i hope that she will be able to continue the family tradition by one day passing it on to her kids			1
' @entity36 said her mother @entity75 hand - washed the cotton gown before the christening after finding it stored away in a family member ’s attic			1
the proud mother now lives in @entity17 , @entity82 with husband @entity83 , 31 , but most of her family and friends still live in @entity32			0

@entity36 , an employment trainer , said : ' my mum washed the gown before the christening as she found it looking slightly yellow			0
happy family : @entity41 with her mother @entity21 , 35 , and her father @entity83 , 31 , at home in @entity82 vintage : @entity102 wore a replica of the @entity105 's @entity6 gown but @entity41 's was the real deal @entity9 , 1874 ( great , great , great grandfather ) @entity108 may , 1903 ( great , great grandfather ) @entity42 may , 1932 ( great grandmother , now @entity42 ) @entity111 , 1954 ( grandmother , now @entity40 ) @entity36 , 1978 ( mother ) @entity14 , 2013 ' on the day it looked so pristine - i could tell my mum became quite emotional while we were putting @entity41 in the gown			1
' all the family members who are aware of the tradition were commenting on how lovely she looked - it was an amazing atmosphere			0
' @entity32 church is at the centre of this tradition as many members of the family have also married there			0
