@entity4 customers with a mighty appetite can now try to tackle the biggest steak available from the high street supermarkets			1
called the @entity9 , the steak weighs 2lb 8oz and is more than five times heavier than the average cut of meat – which are usually a less - daunting 7oz			1
carnivore 's dream : the @entity9 steak is more than five times heavier than the average cut of meat but at such a formidable size it remains to be seen whether the new prime cut of steak will be too much for @entity4 customers to stomach			1
however , @entity21 , the company ’s meat buyer , said he has high hopes that the new product will be a success when it becomes available online for the first time this weekend			0
mr @entity21 said : ‘ i trialled the idea of the @entity9 with my friends			0
when they saw it in my kitchen it had jaws hitting the floor , and there is now a waiting list of guests wanting to come and feast			0
' we ’re really looking forward to seeing our customers ’ reactions and hope that this will be the ultimate dish for them to wow their dinner party guests with			0
’ inspiration : the @entity9 was named after the large @entity47 weapon of the same name the £ 25 @entity50 rib steak is hand trimmed and sold with the entire rib bone left intact to enhance the flavour			1
it has been named the @entity55 because it is said to resemble the large @entity47 weapon			0
the beef is from cattle reared in the @entity59 and is matured for 28 days before it becomes available to order			1
mr @entity21 added : ‘ feasting on colossal slabs of well - reared , well - butchered meat is a simple guilty pleasure you ca n’t beat			0
' we know our customers love eating our delicious steaks , and our @entity9 really is the ultimate steak experience			2
’ @entity4 recommends cooking the steak by frying it first and then browning it in the oven before serving			2
the @entity9 steak is part of @entity4 ’s @entity74 online - only range featuring its own butchers and fishmonger service as an extension of its web - based entertaining range			1
and while the steak will offer the ultimate challenge to the committed carnivore , the supermarket does recommend that the @entity9 should serve two to three people .			2

the so - called @entity9 steak weighs five times more than the average cut
it is aged for 28 days and sold with the rib bone intact for enhanced flavour
the hefty slab of meat will sell for £ 25 in @entity4 's online - only range
