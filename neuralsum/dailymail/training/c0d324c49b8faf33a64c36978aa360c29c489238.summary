a new website has launched for a growing trend of singletons seeking ' part time relationships '			2
started by journalist @entity5 , partimelove.co.uk is designed for those who still want some intimacy and romance in their lives , but not the time commitment a normal relationship demands			1
the website states it is perfect for ' singles looking for regular partners with mutual attraction , genuine friendship , respect and a magical spark but whom have no expectations of moving in after three months and value their free time and independence			1
' the dating website is for those seeking a meaningful relationship without full - time commitment the dating site aims to cater for those who want a real relationship - as opposed to gratuitous sexual encounters - but who only want to invest limited amounts of time to it			1
appealing to potential clientele , the website states : ' perhaps you are just out of a long - term relationship and want to take things slow ? maybe you are a single parent , you travel three days every week or perhaps you are focused on a new career goal and do n't have time for a conventional all - consuming relationship			1
' that should n't mean you have to settle for meaningless flings			0
members of parttimelove.co.uk are all like - minded single people who value their existing lifestyle but still want to spend quality time with someone they care about			1
' joining the website is free of charge and you can chose whether you are ' a man seeking a woman ' , or a ' woman seeking a man			0
' the @entity58 website was created by @entity5 who also writes about the benefits of what she calls the ' low maintenance relationship ' in her latest book and it seems thus far that the website has hit the right tone with many time - strapped singletons with beaming testimonials from the likes of ' @entity69 ' , 36 who writes : ' wish i 'd found a site like this sooner ! i have found a wonderful weekend lover			1
he asks for no more and the times we spend together are magical			0
' another fan ' @entity80 , 47 ' says : ' i 've been married and had a family before			0
i 'm glad i did it and got the t - shirt but i do n't want to do that again but i 'd still love to meet a special girl to care for			1
' founder @entity5 also writes about the benefits of what she calls the ' low maintenance relationship ' in her latest book , screw the @entity90 , which investigates ' alternative models of relationships to conventional marriage '			2
@entity5 is no stranger to unconventional realtionships , having in the past dated older men in return for gifts no stranger to controversial relationships herself , @entity5 has written openly about her time as a member of a site that puts wealthy men ( usually older ) in touch with girls ( usually younger ) who will date them in return for gifts and an ' allowance '			1
@entity5 , now 36 , was a middle - class girl from a loving family in small - town @entity112 but six years ago , she joined dating website @entity115 she started meeting super-rich men who would pay for her company and , by her own admission ; she quickly grew addicted to a glamorous life of luxury			1
' i stepped into a world where money and sex , not love and respect , are the currency of a relationship			2
' i went into the experience with my eyes open			0
i knew the man would bring money and power to the equation and he might expect sex in return , but i could make up my own mind how far i wanted to go , ' @entity5 told the @entity137			2
' in a sense , a normal relationship is an exchange of intimacy and emotional support for exclusivity and companionship			0
' instead , my dates compensated materially for what they could n't offer emotionally			0
in that context , being paid a monthly allowance did n't seem shocking to me			0
' however @entity5 admits that she does nâ€™t believe that her experiences were not healthy			2
' what i did n't see as i was tottering out of five - star hotels in @entity153 heels with more cash in my purse than i knew what to do with was how these experiences were warping my view of relationships , ' she says			0
her new venture aims to enable those who embrace a less conventional view of romantic attachments to find each other , but both are equal partners .			0

aimed at those with ' no expectations of moving in after three months '
members want love without full - time commitment
