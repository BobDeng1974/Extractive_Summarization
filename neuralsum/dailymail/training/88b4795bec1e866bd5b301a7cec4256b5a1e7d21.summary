by @entity1 reporter published : 18:01 est , 19 january 2014 updated : 08:32 est , 20 january 2014 as legalized marijuana sales take off in @entity5 , more businesses are realizing the value of pot in their business model			1
twenty states and the @entity10 allow medical marijuana but voters in @entity5 and @entity13 went a step further in 2012 , becoming the first in the nation to legalize small plant amounts for adult recreational use and to regulate it like alcohol			1
although there are strict state guidelines , governing what can and can not be said with regards to cannabis use , wise businesses are looking towards ambitious cannabis business strategies with the potential for big sales and profits			2
@entity30 : the air carrier is veering into a product - pitching space long dominated by late - night , fast - foodies , hinting at legalized marijuana while beckoning flyers to ' get mile high ' @entity30 is hinting at legalized marijuana beckoning their fliers to ‘ get mile high			1
’ the airline , playing off the approved use and sale of cannabis in the @entity43 , and offering discounted fares to @entity5 where , its ad informs , ‘ the no smoking sign is off , ’ with a wink - wink , nudge - nudge attitude using a sales niche called marijuana marketing			1
the tactic is now also being used by other well known brands @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity56 and @entity57 , running ads suggesting weed use , with code words like ‘ munchies ’ or ‘ bake ’			2
‘ spirit operates in a cutthroat business			2
they get outshouted by the bigger brands so they have to make their marketing dollars work harder and go further			2
and the message needs to be disruptive , ’ said @entity62 , to @entity63 , @entity62 is the founder and ceo of @entity69 , a brand consultancy with clients that include @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
aimed at stoners : companies like @entity61 have run ads intimating weed use , with code words like ' munchies ' @entity81 audience : the new marijuana economics means bigger business for some companies - but they have to be carefully worded ‘ one of the most effective ways of doing that is courting controversy			1
another way is being irreverent			0
they appear to be doing both and adding some humor in the process , ’ @entity62 added			0
‘ as long as @entity30 is not alienating its core target , i think that the current messaging is fine			0
’ while customers may be lining up outside the pot shops in @entity5 , many other companies are using the legalization of marijuana to spur conversation about their product as well			1
with two states ( @entity5 and @entity13 ) having legalized adult cannabis use and 21 states having sanctioned some form of medical marijuana , the number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their tv pitches will only grow			1
@entity115 , a clinical professor of marketing at @entity118 's @entity117 believes that this kind of marketing works for spirit , but would n’t work for legacy characters such as @entity123			0
got the munchies ? companies are being careful not to make the direct link between cannabis and the ' munchies ' even though everyone knows that 's what they 're doing carefully worded : the tactic has been delicately plied by other brands , including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity134 s and @entity135 trend : with two states ( @entity5 and @entity13 ) having legalized adult cannabis use and 21 states having sanctioned some form of medical marijuana , the number of mainstream companies that sprinkle a bit of pot into their tv pitches will only grow ‘ many brands in this country are n't going anywhere near the legalization issue			1
for most brands , that 's very smart , ’ @entity115 said			0
‘ some brands , though , can push this			0
we 're going to see more brands take advantage of this and use this as a way to define themselves			0
’ referring to @entity30 pot - inspired poster , said @entity162 , a co-founder of @entity163 ( @entity164 ) does n’t think it ’s a good idea			2
‘ it 's just part of trying to climb on the bandwagon of being edgy and trying to be cool to get a certain demographic			0
but most people will put two and two together and realize they do n't want a company they rely on for safety , glamorizing and normalizing something that directly would result in an accident			0
i 'm not sure it 's best practice for an airline			0
and if you really think about it , it 's unbelievable			0
’ some food - focused entrepreneurs are betting adult recreational marijuana becomes an alternative to wine consumption			1
although no mainstream companies that are experimenting with marijuana marketing use the word ‘ marijuana ’ in their ads , the companies are also unwilling to explain the thinking behind their productions – and leaving it for the public , or perhaps just pot heads to work out .			1

with two states ( @entity5 and @entity13 ) having legalized adult cannabis use and 21 states having sanctioned some form of medical marijuana , more companies are hinting at pot use
companies run carefully - worded adverts with *double* meanings to ensure those in the - know get the message
