by @entity0 published : 04:38 est , 16 april 2012 updated : 06:08 est , 16 april 2012 over the past few weeks , much has been written and remembered about the @entity1 , which famously sank exactly one hundred years ago yesterday			2
but while the story the hubris surrounding @entity1 has been told again and again , not so much has been said about its nemesis - the iceberg that sent it to a watery grave			0
these pictures , taken after the @entity1 sank , show what is quite possibly the only photographic evidence of the ice floe that caused the tragedy			1
ancient : this photo of the iceberg that sank the @entity1 was taken by the chief steward of the @entity18 ocean liner @entity19 just hours after the tragedy			1
its identity was confirmed by a red streak of paintwork scraped across its base , an indication that it had collided with a vessel in the past 12 hours or so the first was taken by the chief steward of @entity29 , a @entity18 liner , which sailed through the @entity31 on april 15 just miles from where the @entity1 sank the night before			1
he recorded seeing a streak of red paint smeared across the base of the floe - indicating that it was likely it had collided with a ship in the past 12 hours			2
the next photo was taken by captain @entity40 of the @entity41 , a cable laying vessel which raced to the scene of the shipwreck to recover corpses and debris			0
according to the @entity41 's records , it was the only iceberg in the area			0
he also noticed the red scar along the base - a clear sign it was the culprit for the @entity1 's ignominious end			0
that iceberg began its slow journey to the @entity31 over three throusand years ago - making it a rough contemporary of @entity58 @entity57			1
the exact details can only be a matter for speculation , but @entity63 reports that it likely began with snowfall on the @entity66 coast of @entity67 somewhere around @entity68			2
as months passed , this snow gradually turned into a more compacted form - known as firn - which over subsequent decades was compressed into dense ice as new layers of fresh snow fell on top			0
massive : captain @entity40 of the cable laying vessel @entity79 captured this shot of the iceberg as it sped to the scene to help with the @entity1 recovery			0
it likely began life some 30 centuries ago - around the time of @entity57 - as a blizzard on @entity67 's tundra solidified to form glaciers hundreds of generations passed and entire civilisations rose and fell as this ill - fated ice was slowly forced further west towards the sea			1
finally reaching @entity67 's @entity96 coast , the lapping tide began breaking away chunks of the glacier and the infamous iceberg was calved - thirty centuries after first freezing			1
but after it finally fell into the sea , the iceberg 's life was a short one , @entity63 reports			0
in order to reach the spot in the @entity31 where the @entity1 met its fate , currents must have taken the floe far south from where it was calved			1
from the @entity67 coast , it would have floated on the currents from @entity116 to the @entity117 , onto the @entity118 and then finally into the @entity31			1
catastrophe : an undated artist 's impression shows the chaos and confusion of the titanic disaster			0
water temperature that night is thought to have been @entity126 - lethal to anyone pitched into the sea watery grave : the prow of the @entity1 seen from a @entity131 beneath the @entity31 remains : a white crab scampers near the remains of a coat and boots lying in the mud on the sea bed near @entity1 's stern by april 15 , 2012 , the date of the titanic disaster , the iceberg was some 5,000 miles south of the @entity143			1
that night , the water temperature was estimated at about @entity145 ( @entity146 ) - lethal for anyone unlucky enough to find themselves plunged into it but far too warm to sustain icebergs for long			0
the life - expectancy of an iceberg in the @entity31 is about two or three years from calving to melting			2
this means , according to io9 , that it is likely the @entity157 broke off from @entity67 in 1910 or 1911 and was gone for ever by 1913 at the latest .			0
