in a sport increasingly dominated by statistical analysis and calm dissection of performances it was reassuring to hear @entity5 discuss the depth of anger felt by @entity9 ’s players on reviewing their @entity11 no - show			1
@entity5 , one of the few @entity9 stars to depart @entity13 with his reputation enhanced last sunday , revealed the extent of the frustration within the @entity9 squad at their misfiring display when their @entity20 dream was broken by a series of tactical and technical blunders			1
@entity24 ’s men held a debrief on tuesday at their five - star @entity27 retreat in @entity29 and the video analysis made for uncomfortable viewing			1
@entity5 has revealed the frustration felt by @entity9 's squad as they relived the @entity11 defeat chief among their concerns was the spectacular first - half line - out fail which saw @entity9 hooker @entity40 throw straight to 6ft 10in @entity11 lock @entity41 at the back when a clean catch and drive would have almost certainly yielded points			1
@entity9 ’s repeated disciplinary infringements also led to a 13 to eight penalty deficit and @entity5 admits watching the match again was deeply frustrating			1
‘ there is room for emotion because you are frustrated with the game and there were a few things we ’ve gone over , ’ he said			0
‘ we did n’t plan to do a lot of the stuff that we did			0
trust me we did n’t train what we did at the weekend			0
we did n’t do that on the training field			0
‘ there is that frustration and it comes out in anger or whatever from coaches and players because they are frustrated in that regard			1
it is not just a cool , calm dissection – sometimes it is but if a point needs to be raised it is talked about			0
@entity9 failed to take their chances and made some basic errors , before being punished by the @entity74 ‘ it was interesting , it was good , it was honest			2
i think there were some areas – a lot of areas obviously – where we did n’t perform like we should have done			0
’ @entity11 outmanoeuvred @entity9 by denying them scrummaging opportunities and by failing to implement the expected ‘ choke tackle ’ , therefore denying the visitors the chance to play to their strengths			1
their @entity87 half - back pair of @entity88 and @entity89 controlled field position with some outstanding tactical kicking			2
when @entity9 did have a chance to gain a foothold in the game , @entity40 ’s wayward throw to @entity41 cost them dear after @entity96 opted to kick a kickable penalty to the corner			2
@entity5 was one of the few englishmen to come out of the defeat in @entity13 with any credit ‘ that line - out was a frustration			1
in international rugby if you get a set piece in the opposition 22 and especially 5m out you have to take it , ’ @entity5 added			2
‘ you do n’t really get another chance like that against sides like @entity11 , and we did n’t really get one			2
i ’m not saying that the game changed on that but it was an emotional swing			0
' they steal the ball and the crowd lifts up			0
you score there and it is a different mentality			0
it was n’t the reason we lost the game but next time we ’ll probably throw away from the 6ft 10 bloke with long arms ! ’ the @entity9 prop will hope his side can bounce back against @entity128 at @entity129 next week while @entity133 referee @entity132 took exception to much of @entity9 ’s work at the break down , @entity130 and his team hope @entity138 @entity137 will be more forgiving at @entity129 against unfancied @entity128 next saturday			1
@entity5 added : ‘ referees have their strengths and weaknesses , just like players do			1
set - piece , open play , some refs will let you play stuff , others wo n’t			2
there is a variance but it is a case of being as clean as you can			0
if you are positive in your actions , you will be on the right side of the referee			0

@entity9 lost to @entity11 *19* - 9 last week in @entity13
@entity5 reveals the frustration after players watched video back
@entity159 went against @entity9 's plans as mistakes let them down
