by @entity0 you can never quite be sure what the sea will throw up			0
but if you happen to be a surfer who combines athletic feats on a board with a skilled touch in the studio , then any ocean detritus can be transformed into something dramatic			0
it came from the deep : @entity14 create artworks with rubbish washed up on beaches - including the fragments of rubber used to create this tiger shark hugely inventive : the three artists have also created this giant fish using scraps of rusted metal - such as tin lids and compressed drinks cans artists @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 – who collectively work as @entity14 ( www.skeletonsea.com ) – have made a name for themselves through the sculptures and installations they make using items they find on beaches and in the waves			1
these shoes were made for ... being recycled into an elaborate sculpture : another of the art collective 's concoctions was made using lost flip - flops taking on human form : @entity14 have also created smaller artworks - including these human-esque figures fashioned from discarded rubber gloves surfers as much as they are creative types , the trio started out simply by collecting rubbish and washed - up materials they encountered while riding oceanic breakers – old lifebuoys separated from ships , shards of metal from wrecked vessels , scraps of rubber , chunks of wood , floating plastics and other myriad non-biodegradable substances			1
but they soon found that they could turn this unsightly trash into rather more beautiful objects – and make a pertinent point while doing so			0
making a point : ' @entity70 ' comes with an environmental message based upon the importance of keeping the oceans clean making the most of it : the artists are also surfers , and were inspired to begin creating sculptures using the detritus they found while boarding by turning burst tyres , clusters of electric cables , dead car parts and strips of blackened metal into marine creatures such as life - sized sharks – complete with teeth and fins – they have been able to stress the importance of keeping the oceans free of pollution			1
other creations have included giant fish constructed from can lids , soft - drink containers and lost flip - flops – and human figures shaped out of discarded rubber gloves			2
on display : the sculptures have been put on show in several parts of @entity102 , and were recently exhibited at @entity103 , in @entity104 rooftop view : @entity107 sits in @entity108 - a town that occupies a wave - lashed peninsula some 60 miles north of @entity111 on @entity104 's @entity113 coast ‘ @entity119 ’ , meanwhile , sees an iconic female figure of oceanic legend perched , in multi-coloured fashion , on a large ball of abandoned fishing nets			1
it was devised by @entity30 from flotsam picked up on various beaches in @entity123 and south - east @entity124			2
‘ the creative idea behind the work was to contrast the beauty of this well - known mythical being with the ugly truth that lurks beneath the surface of our oceans , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity119 represents another way for us to spread the collective ’s environmental message based around the importance of keeping our oceans clean			0
’ odds and ends : some of @entity14 's creations have a macabre edge , including this skull constructed from , among other things , broken meshing and plastic bottles making faces : the exhibits drew a crowd when they went on display over @entity150 - and will return to @entity103 for a second showing in september the trio have exhibited their work in @entity155 – in @entity156 , and in the @entity158 region in the north of the country – and in @entity161 , in western @entity162			2
they have also held workshops at @entity165 , just south of @entity166 on @entity169 ’s @entity168 coast – with the aim of promoting the welfare of the region ’s turtle population , plus the concept of clean beaches			0
most recently , the sculptures went on show at @entity103 ( www.surferslodgepeniche.com ) – a beachside retreat in the small @entity104 town of @entity108 , which nestles on its own circular peninsula , some 60 miles north of @entity111			1
things that the everyday folks leave behind : suitable materials for making these artworks are easy to source , with items regularly washing up on beaches things to make and do : the artists also hold workshops where children and other interested parties can learn to make art from beach trash the town is a neat fit for such an exhibition , assailed on all sides by @entity113 waves – while the hotel ’s roof terrace proved to be a suitable gallery for their display			1
the exhibition was held over @entity150 , but will return for a second edition in september .			0

surfing artists produce striking sculptures using flotsam and jetsam they find on beaches and in the waves
these recycled - material artworks usually take the form of sea creatures , such as tiger sharks or other large fish
the exhibits go on *occasional* display , and will be on show at a *seafront* hotel at @entity108 , near @entity111 , in september
