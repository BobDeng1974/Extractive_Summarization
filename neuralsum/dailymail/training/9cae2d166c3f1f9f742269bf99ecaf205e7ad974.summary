after @entity1 noticed her belly was swelling , doctors told her she had a hernia			1
but when the 70 - year - old finally went under the knife after more than a decade , surgeons removed a beach ball - sized tumour weighing an astonishing 56lb			1
ms @entity1 , of @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 , said it was between 10 and 12 years ago that she first noticed she was putting on weight			1
' three different doctors thought it was a hernia , ' she told local broadcaster @entity27			2
and so ms @entity1 was shocked when staff at @entity29 revealed that the growth was actually a benign ovarian tumour			1
carrying around the weight of about four bowling balls had taken its toll on ms @entity1			1
by the time doctors took action she was suffering severe pain in her back , ribs and stomach and could barely walk , using furniture to steady herself			2
dr @entity41 , one of the surgeons at the hospital , said the tumour was cutting off the patient 's circulation , preventing blood from flowing to her legs and back to her heart			2
suffered in silence : the 70 - year - old patient first noticed her stomach was growing more than a decade ago following the complex operation last month , he told @entity27 : ' it was well off the beaten path			2
there ’s not a paragraph or chapter that tells you quite how to do this one			0
it had distorted the normal anatomy so much , you had to be careful you did n’t injure something , a loop of bowel for example			0
' once removed , the growth was sent to a lab for analysis , where it was found to be made up of thin walls holding a viscous fluid			0
dr @entity41 had not seen a tumour of this size for years			0
he said he had encountered a 100lb growth while he was training , but even this is dwarfed by the world record of 300lb			0
ms @entity1 spoke of her relief that her ordeal is over , and said the experience has cured her phobia of doctors			1
' i feel wonderful now , ' she added			0
doctors said she has made a full recovery and did not suffer any lasting effects .			0

@entity1 , 70 , put off seeking help for huge ovarian cyst
