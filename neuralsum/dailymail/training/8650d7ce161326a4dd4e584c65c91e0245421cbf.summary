by @entity1 reporter published : 02:47 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 19:22 est , 23 may 2012 @entity2 is set to send fighter jets to the @entity4 and could attack @entity6 vessels in the @entity7 if @entity8 launches air strikes , the @entity1 has learned			1
@entity10 has been warned that @entity6 could attack @entity2 targets if its nuclear sites come under fire			1
the @entity14 last week discussed how the @entity2 could respond if there is a fresh war in the @entity4			2
options : @entity2 ministers say it could send the @entity20 to the @entity4 if war breaks out between @entity6 and @entity8 later this year over the former 's , heading by president @entity23 , nuclear ambitions separately , the attorney general has been asked to advise on what action the @entity2 could legally take in the event of an attack			1
senior sources say @entity31 and @entity32 jets are likely to be sent to @entity34 air base in @entity35 to help defend @entity2 ’s @entity7 allies against retaliatory attacks by @entity6			1
the @entity38 would help to protect @entity35 , the @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
‘ we are looking at what we and others could do to reassure our @entity7 @entity48 allies that we are on their side , ’ a @entity43 official said			0
the @entity2 ’s priority would be to work with the @entity52 to keep open the @entity53 , through which much of the world ’s oil passes			1
the @entity56 and @entity57 are also drawing up plans for the protection of @entity2 bases and embassies in the @entity4 and beyond , since intelligence chiefs predict an attack by @entity6 - backed terrorists			1
security sources say @entity2 would not be involved in initiating a military attack against @entity6			1
a senior @entity43 source said : ‘ this is planning for the day after , not the day before			0
’ testing times : the key oil shipping route , the @entity53 , could be closed by @entity6 if it is attacked by @entity8 @entity2 ministers say the deployment of the @entity20 in the @entity4 is just one of the options on their table should war break out the @entity77 reports that ministers remain hopeful negotiations can stop @entity6 building a nuclear bomb and persuade @entity8 not to carry out a pre-emptive strike			1
the desire to become involved is due to fears that an attack could trigger a wider war in the @entity4			0
@entity2 's pondering comes as @entity6 made its first move in attempts to gain an edge in nuclear talks with the @entity52 and other world powers			1
it agreed in principle to allow @entity94 inspectors to restart probes into a military site suspected of harbouring tests related to atomic weapons			1
but @entity52 officials have shown no willingness to shift into bargaining mode so quickly , setting the stage for possible tense moments after talks today resume in @entity106 's fortified @entity105			1
still , @entity6 's move raises the pressure on the @entity109 for some reciprocal gestures to keep dialogue on track and further highlights @entity114 's apparent aims of opening a long give - and - take process over its nuclear ambitions			1
@entity6 president @entity23 will head to @entity118 in june to talk about his country 's nuclear programme with @entity118 president @entity121			2
he will attend the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) meeting - a regional security forum of @entity118 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 and which @entity6 is attending as an observer			0
the summit will likely be overshadowed by the presence of @entity23 , whose country is at the centre of a standoff with the @entity109 over its nuclear programme			0
@entity23 's visit to @entity118 takes on particular significance as @entity118 is a veto - wielding permanent member of the @entity139 and has resisted @entity52 demands for sanctions on @entity6			1
@entity118 is also a major buyer of @entity6 crude oil			0
@entity118 premier @entity144 warned @entity114 in january against any effort to acquire nuclear weapons			2
but @entity147 has generally been reticent about publicly warning @entity6 or even firmly suggesting that @entity114 might want to develop the means to develop nuclear weapons			1
@entity118 has repeatedly urged a negotiated solution to the dispute over @entity114 's atomic activities , which @entity154 governments say appear aimed at mastering the means to make nuclear weapons			2
@entity114 says those activities are peaceful			0
a major breakthrough in the impasse was not expected in @entity106 , with officials and experts saying both sides will seek to demonstrate enough progress to keep the process moving forward			0
that could cool down worries in international markets over possible military action , but reinforce the suspicions of @entity8 leaders who claim @entity6 seeks only to buy time to keep up its production of nuclear fuel			1
@entity6 's envoys , meanwhile , promoted the @entity106 talks as an opportunity to set aside past obstacles			1
@entity178 , @entity6 's top nuclear negotiator , said : ' that is the basis for the beginning of a new co-operation			2
we hope talks in @entity106 will be a kind of dialogue that will give shape to such co-operation			2
' @entity6 's ambassador to @entity190 , @entity189 , said the @entity106 talks could be historic			1
he said : ' should the talks set a start for a serious , constructive settlement of the issues , it could be a historic meeting for all sides			0
' a senior @entity154 diplomat in @entity106 said sanctions on @entity6 's oil exports , set to take effect on july 1 , likely pushed @entity114 to the bargaining table			1
he said : ' i do n't think the @entity6 are coming to these talks because they suddenly changed their minds about anything			2
they are coming to these talks because sanctions are beginning to bite			0
' in @entity6 terms , that means offering some possible accommodations - such as opening to greater @entity94 inspections			1
but sticking to its right to enrich uranium as a signatory of @entity94 nuclear treaties			2
the @entity106 talks , involving the five permanent @entity139 members plus @entity220 , could offer a test of how much the @entity52 and allies are willing to bend from demands for @entity6 to halt to all enrichment and instead concentrate on just stopping the highest - grade production			1
the @entity109 and others fear the 20 per cent - level enrichment can be turned quickly into weapons - grade of over 90 per cent			0
moving forward : @entity6 has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research @entity6 has repeatedly denied it seeks nuclear arms and says its reactors are only for power and medical research			2
yesterday , the official @entity235 reported that @entity6 scientists had inserted a domestically made fuel rod , which contains pellets of 20 per cent enriched uranium , into the core of a research nuclear reactor in @entity114			1
the advance would be another step in achieving proficiency in the entire nuclear fuel cycle			0
@entity6 said in january it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod , and it had to find a way to make them because @entity154 sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets			2
western claims about a clandestine atomic weapons programme have often cited @entity6 's @entity255 military facility , where the @entity94 's @entity256 believes @entity6 in 2003 ran explosive tests needed to set off a nuclear charge			1
@entity6 describes @entity255 as a conventional military site			1
the agency 's chief , @entity260 , returned to @entity262 yesterday from a one - day trip to @entity114 and said an agreement is within reach to give inspectors ' access to sites , scientists and documents it seeks to restart its probe '			2
future : @entity6 said in january it had produced the first nuclear fuel rod , and it had to find a way to make them because @entity154 sanctions prohibit their purchase from foreign markets he noted that some differences still exist but claimed they ' will not be an obstacle to reach agreement			0
' he gave no details on the unsettled points or when the pact could be signed			0
@entity260 's remarks brought a measured response from @entity285 and allies			0
@entity288 press secretary @entity287 called the announcement a ' step forward ' and ' a step in the right direction '			0
but he stressed that the administration will ' make judgments about @entity6 's behaviour based on actions , not just promises or agreements '			0
he added : ' we judge and will judge @entity6 by its actions			0
we 're not at the stage of negotiating what @entity6 would get in return for fulfillment of its obligations			0
' in @entity220 , foreign minister @entity304 said the apparent inspection pact was an ' overdue step in the right direction '			0
but he added : ' the aim is to make progress not just atmospherically but also on substance			0
' @entity8 's defense minister , @entity310 , dismissed it as a ' deception of progress ' to stave off international pressure			0
suspicions : @entity2 's pondering comes as @entity6 made its first move in attempts to gain an edge in nuclear talks with the @entity52 and other world powers he said : ' it looks like the @entity6 are trying to reach a technical agreement that will create a deception of progress in talks in order to reduce the pressure ahead of talks tomorrow in @entity106 and postpone harshening of sanctions			1
' on monday , the @entity331 backed proposals for further sanctions on @entity6 , including requiring companies listed on @entity52 stock exchanges to disclose any @entity6 - related business			1
@entity52 and @entity338 measures already have targeted @entity6 's oil exports - its chief revenue source - and effectively blocked the country from international banking networks			2
even before the meetings begin in @entity106 , expectations were kept in check			0
@entity190 foreign minister @entity346 said they will ' not produce a miracle '			0
' but everybody is looking for some tangible steps on the basis of reciprocity , ' @entity346 added , also saying there is consensus in @entity6 for the first time to reach a diplomatic deal			0
@entity357 , an analyst and former @entity6 foreign ministry official , said ' the two sides should begin with small steps , not big demands , if they are to make any progress '			0
the @entity52 has been vague about its immediate goals , with officials saying the talks will gauge @entity6 's seriousness and explore elements of a possible agreement			1
president @entity369 opposes a near - term military strike on @entity6 's nuclear facilities			2
he has pressed @entity8 to give diplomacy and sanctions time to work while insisting that military options are available should talks fail			1
@entity376 have criticised @entity369 for holding talks with @entity6 at all .			0
