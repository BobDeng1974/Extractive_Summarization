@entity1 milk needs to be reformulated – for boys and girls			0
researcher @entity4 said just as we produce different deodorants for men and women , we should consider making gender - specific formula milk			1
dr @entity4 also said that as breast milk varies so much from woman to woman , in some cases supplementing with formula may be better for the baby			1
@entity1 milk should be reformulated to be gender - specific , says dr @entity4 , from @entity17 she spoke out after showing that nursing monkeys make different milk for boys and girls			1
milk for male babies is fattier and higher in protein and the milk made for the firstborn male is particularly rich			1
in contrast , the milk for female babies is less rich but there is more of it			0
it is also higher in bone - building calcium			2
the @entity34 ’s annual conference also heard that the few humans studies carried out have had mixed results			0
but some have also hinted at sex - specific differences			2
there are also differences in the way the sexes respond to breast milk			0
dr @entity4 , of @entity17 in the @entity44 , has shown male and female monkeys respond to the stress hormone cortisol in different ways			1
and work on human babies found that girls , but not boys , get more fractious if their mother ’s milk is high in cortisol			0
dr @entity4 says some women produce such poor quality breast milk their babies would be better off with formula milk			1
as a result , she says it 's important women are not made to feel guilty if they do n't breastfeed however , in rat studies at least , this has long term benefits , with the animals actually better at coping with stressful situations than others			0
research also shows that the quality of breast milk varies greatly from woman to woman , with different amounts of vitamins , minerals , sugars , fats and other nutrients			0
in some cases , the quality is so low that formula may be better			0
however , women are made to feel guilty if they do n’t breastfeed , said dr @entity4			2
calling for more research on sex - specific formula milk , she said : ‘ public health would be aided if greater attention was paid to this			1
‘ we have good reasons to be sceptical of a one - size - fits - all formula milk			2

dr @entity4 , from @entity17 , says formula milk could be gender - specific
she says monkeys produce milk that is fattier and higher in protein for male infant monkeys and milk that is higher in calcium for females
