by @entity0 the bizarre six - sided storm churning @entity3 ’s north pole has flummoxed astronomers ever since it was first spotted thirty years ago			1
now , astronomers believe they may have solved one of its biggest mysteries by working out how it operates - and discovering the rotation period of @entity3 in the process			1
the giant storm operates rather like the jet stream on @entity13 they say - explaining why it never appears to move			1
the mysterious six - sided hexagon on @entity3 ’s @entity26 has long captivated astronomers is thought to be is nearly 20,000 miles ( 30,000 kilometers )			1
the hexagon is made of a band of upper - atmospheric winds which creates its six - sided shape			2
a polar cyclone can be seen at its centre			0
first seen by @entity34 1 and 2 over 30 years ago the hexagon it thought to be fixed with @entity3 ’s rotation			2
last year , the @entity38 spacecraft provided scientists with the first close - up , visible - light views of a behemoth hurricane swirling within the hexagon			2
thin , bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane were estimated to be travelling at around 330 mph ( 150 metres per second )			0
the unusual structure with a hexagonal shape surrounding @entity3 's north pole was spotted on the planet for the first time thirty years ago			1
the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200 mph winds and spans 20,000 miles ( 30,000 kilometers ) across - more than twice the diameter of @entity13			1
nothing similar with such a regular geometry had ever been seen on any planet in the @entity58			0
the @entity59 has now been able to study and measure the phenomenon and , establish its rotation period , and that of @entity3 - the only planet in the @entity58 whose rotation time remains unknown			1
researchers found seasonal variations do not affect the hexagon and its jet stream at all , so concluded both are part of an extensive wave , deeply rooted in @entity3 's atmosphere			1
the @entity76 / @entity75 researchers suggest that the hexagon and its stream are the manifestation of a ' @entity72 ' similar to those that form in the mid-latitudes of the earth			0
on our planet the jet stream meanders from west to east and brings , associated with it , the system of areas of low pressure and anticyclones which we have been seeing regularly on weather maps			0
on @entity3 , a hydrogen gas planet , ten times the size of the @entity13 , cold in its upper clouds , without a solid surface , and with an atmosphere as deep as that of an ocean , ' the hexagonal wavy motion of the jet stream is expected to be propagated vertically and reveal to us aspects of the planet ’s hidden atmosphere , ' said @entity108 , head of the @entity110 research group			1
@entity3 's storm in action : scientists have announced a breakthrough in understand how the storm is created ' the movement of the hexagon could therefore be linked to the depths of @entity3 , and the rotation period of this structure , which , as we have been able to ascertain , is 10 hours , 39 minutes and 23 seconds , could be that of the planet itself , ' he added			1
@entity3 is the only planet in the @entity58 whose rotation period is not yet known			2
due to the tilt of approximately 27º of the planet @entity3 , its polar atmosphere undergoes intense seasonable variations with long polar nights lasting over seven years , followed by a long period of 23 years of variable illumination			0
in 1980 and 1981 @entity134 's @entity135 and 2 space probes passed for the first time over the planet @entity3 , located 1,500 million km from the @entity139 among their numerous discoveries they observed a strange , hexagon - shaped structure in the planet ’s uppermost clouds surrounding its north pole			1
the new analysis allowed astronomers to track the hexagonal storm for the first time to see how it rotated , and work out how it was formed the hexagon remained virtually static , and images captured by the @entity135 probes found that the clouds were moving rapidly inside the hexagon in an enclosed jet stream and were being dragged by winds travelling at over 400 km / h. thirty years later – the equivalent of one @entity3 year , in other words , the time the planet takes to go all the way around the @entity139 – and over more than six consecutive years , researchers in the @entity76 / @entity75 ’s @entity59 , in collaboration with astronomers from various countries , were able to observe @entity3 's northern polar region in detail once again and confirmed that the hexagon continued in place			1
after measuring the positions of the hexagon vertices with great precision , they determined that its movement remains extremely stable , and on the basis of the cloud movements , that the jet stream inside it remains unchanged			0
it comes just months after footage captured by the @entity38 spacecraft using colour filters , showed researchers a complete view of the top of @entity3 for the first time			2
‘ a hurricane on @entity13 typically lasts a week , but this has been here for decades - and who knows - maybe centuries , ’ said @entity183 , at the @entity184 in @entity185			1
this animation above shows a view from directly over the north pole , keeping up with the rotation of the planet so that all the motion seen on the screen is the motion of the storms inside the hexagon			2
this older , colour composite image - showing false shades - has been created from raw images taken by @entity38 from a distance of 379,268 miles away weather patterns on @entity13 are interrupted when they encounter friction from land forms			2
scientists suspect the stability of the hexagon has something to do with the lack of solid land forms on @entity3 , which is essentially a giant ball of gas			0
better views of the hexagon are available now because the sun began to illuminate its interior in late 2012			0
@entity38 captured images of the hexagon over a 10 - hour time span with high - resolution cameras , giving scientists a good look at the motion of cloud structures within			0
scientists saw the storm around the pole , as well as small vortices rotating in the opposite direction of the hexagon			0
some of the vortices are swept along with the jet stream as if on a racetrack			0
the largest of these vortices spans about 2,200 miles ( 3,500 km ) , or about twice the size of the largest hurricane recorded on @entity13			1
the footage captured by the @entity38 spacecraft is the first of its kind , using colour filters , to show a complete view of the top of @entity3 scientists analysed these images in false colour , a rendering method that made it easier to distinguish differences among the types of particles suspended in the atmosphere inside and outside the hexagon			0
‘ inside the hexagon , there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles , while outside the hexagon , the opposite is true , ’ said @entity251 , a @entity38 imaging team associate at @entity253 in @entity254			0
‘ the hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier , which results in something like @entity13 's @entity266 ozone hole			2
’ the @entity266 ozone hole forms within a region enclosed by a jet stream with similarities to the hexagon			0
wintertime conditions enable ozone - destroying chemical processes to occur and the jet stream prevents a resupply of ozone from the outside			0
at @entity3 , large aerosols can not cross into the hexagonal jet stream from outside and large aerosol particles are created when sunlight shines on the atmosphere			0
only recently , with the start of @entity3 's northern spring in august 2009 , did sunlight begin bathing the planet 's northern hemisphere			1
‘ as we approach @entity3 's summer solstice in 2017 , lighting conditions over its north pole will improve , and we are excited to track the changes that occur both inside and outside the hexagon boundary , ’ said @entity285 , @entity38 deputy project scientist .			1

storm on @entity3 's north pole rages with winds of 200mph
largest wind system is 2,200 miles wide - this is twice the size of largest hurricane ever recorded on @entity13
@entity300 has also led astronomers to calculate how often @entity3 rotates for the first time
