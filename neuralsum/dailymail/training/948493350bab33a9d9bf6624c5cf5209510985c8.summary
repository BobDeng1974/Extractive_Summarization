by @entity0 , science reporter published : 16:06 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 16:06 est , 8 july 2013 bladder cancer can now be detected long before symptoms develop - after scientists created a device that can smell the disease			2
responding to chemicals in a patient ’s urine , the sensor is able to give an accurate diagnosis within 30 minutes			1
around 10,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year but there are no reliable screening methods , unlike in breast or cervical cancers			2
bladder cancer can now be detected long before symptoms develop - after scientists created a device that can smell the disease due to later diagnosis , it is one of the most common causes of death in cancer patients			2
the device , known as the @entity28 , was inspired by a dog ’s ability to detect smells that escape the human nose , including the scent of lung cancer			1
in a trial on 98 patients - 24 of whom had cancer - the sensor was 100 per cent accurate in identifying individuals with the disease			1
larger clinical trials are now planned before the technique becomes publicly available			0
the researchers hope the technique can also be used to diagnose the early stages of prostate cancer			0
researcher professor @entity48 , from the @entity50 ’s @entity49 , said : ‘ each year approximately 10,000 people in the @entity52 are diagnosed with bladder cancer			0
‘ it is a disease that , if caught early , can be treated effectively , but unfortunately we do not have any early screening methods other than diagnosis through urine tests at the stage when it starts to become a problem			1
’ researchers from the @entity63 , the @entity50 , and @entity64 have spent four years developing the @entity28			1
the device contains a sensor that responds to chemicals in a patient ’s urine			2
scientists are then able to read the profile to diagnose the presence of cancer cells in the bladder			0
responding to chemicals in a patient 's urine , the sensor is able to give an accurate diagnosis within 30 minutes researcher professor @entity78 from the @entity79 at @entity63 said : ‘ it is thought that dogs can smell cancer , but this is obviously not a practical way for hospitals to diagnose the disease			1
‘ taking this principle , however , we have developed a device that can give us a profile of the odour in urine			0
it reads the gases that chemicals in the urine can give off when the sample is heated			0
‘ @entity28 works by inserting a bottle containing the urine sample into the device			1
about 30 minutes later the @entity98 is capable of showing the diagnosis on the computer screen if the sample derives from a patient with bladder cancer			1
it is simple to use and could be operated in a doctor ’s surgery			0
’ the study is published in the journal @entity109 .			0

@entity28 can detect the disease in a patient 's urine
can be used by *gp* and gives result in 30 minutes
trials showed it to be 100 *%* accurate
