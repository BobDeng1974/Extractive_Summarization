when a photographer took a trip to one of @entity6 leader @entity5 's pet projects - built to bring in thousands of foreign tourists to the country - he discovered a sparkling clean ski resort ... with barely another person or drop of snow in sight			1
the communist enclave 's one and only ski destination , on top of @entity17 , boasts a hotel with wood cabin style rooms , complimentary toiletries , and spa facilities and 110 kilometres ( 70 miles ) of multi-level slopes			2
however , photographer @entity23 , from @entity24 , who took the photos while on his fourth trip to @entity6 from 16 - 20 october , did not find any other tourists to mingle with			1
' i saw one western tourist on a " private tour " at the @entity32 resort			0
i ’m not sure who he was			0
i did n't ask , ' mr @entity23 told @entity35			2
they were originally going to be bought from @entity42 but the deal was blocked because of trade sanctions the @entity46 ski resort was built on top of @entity17 , near the port city and naval base @entity49 , in just 10 months photographer @entity23 was given access to photograph the wood cabin style bedrooms , including this one in the ' second class accommodation ' ‘ other than that , there ’s only the locals working on several upgrades before the winter season			1
‘ there ’s no snow now so i had expected it to be empty , ’ he added			0
mr @entity23 said the lack of people did n't matter to him , as his five day vacation gave him the chance ' to capture the autumn colours and also do an exclusive full access tour of the @entity68 during their off - peak season ’			1
the @entity46 ski resort , built on top of @entity17 , near the port city and naval base @entity49 , opened for business earlier this year and hopes to bring 5,000 visitors a day			1
a ski-less @entity5 visited the resort when it had snowy surroundings at the end of last year the @entity77 at @entity68 has a fake green grass floor and wicker chairs for skiers to enjoy refreshments in the @entity77 is a strange structure constructed next the ski resort 's tiered hotel building a cafe in the @entity87 lobby has coffee bean pictures on its walls and purple plush chairs alongside its questionable interior design his ( left ) and her ( right ) hair salons are available on site with a collection of permitted styles pictured on the walls for customers to choose from the massage room in the hotel spa features two beds , which can be divided by a curtain for privacy mr @entity23 said the pools ' are especially nice since the weather outside is cold and the water is nice and warm ' the pool was complete and ready for swimmers to enjoy but nobody was swimming lengths in october a large sauna room is big enough for many visitors to sweat it out but when mr @entity23 visited there was nobody using it the steam room with white plastic seats was also empty but looked sparkling clean full body dryers stood @entity122 and basic showers were provided in the spa area treadmills , a bicycle and cross-trainer machines are offered up for visitors to keep their fitness up while on vacation the sprawling 1,400 - hectare resort was built in just ten months as part of a push by leader @entity5 to increase overseas tourist numbers from 200,000 to 1 million per annum by 2016			1
although tourists and official regime photographers have taken some photos of the resort before , mr @entity23 was given exclusive access to all parts of the destination – apart from two prized new areas that are still under construction ... ‘ i was permitted to photograph a comprehensive collection of images of the entire facility			1
the only stuff i was n’t permitted to photograph was the new helicopter landing pad currently being built and the latest extension to their ski lift system that is also under construction , ’ he explained			0
mr @entity23 stayed in the onsite hotel in a ' third - class room ' and tried out the facilities , including a gym , sauna , hairdressers , and restaurant and had the whole place to himself			1
an onsite ski shop sells a limited range of goods , including bright coloured trainers , backpacks and sports clothing bottled water and other soft drinks are sold in the food section of the shop in refrigerators visitors can hire skis and snow boots from the resort			2
at the end of last year , a ski-less @entity5 was photographed surveying the then snowy surroundings during his visit for guests looking to party , there is a karaoke and dance room with coloured lighting and a marble floor a female worker stands behind the bar at the hotel , smiling in a smart uniform ‘ the pools are especially nice since the weather outside is cold and the water is nice and warm , ’ he said			0
at the end of last year , a ski-less @entity5 was photographed surveying the snowy surroundings during his visit			0
the leader was said to note ' with great satisfaction ' that everything was ' impeccable '			0
he also gave instructions to serve visitors to the site well - and ensure they may ' keenly feel the loving care of the party ' , local media reported			0
the @entity207 ( @entity207 ) described the slopes as a ' great monumental structure in the era of @entity211 ' , referring to the nation 's ' military first ' policy			0
wooden table and chairs stand in an empty dining room during the off - peak season a mismatch of styles is used in another dining area , including a floor that has fake grass and fake patio on it a pool table is provided for holiday goers to play on inside the resort on top of @entity17 mr @entity23 stayed in a ' third class ' room ( right ) , where he was provided with complimentary white hotel slippers ( left ) some rather clinical lighting gave the bathroom a yellow - hue but it was clear everything was brand new free @entity6 toiletries were provided in mr @entity23 's en - suite bathroom the military played a leading role in the project , with soldiers from the @entity242 helping to build it			1
hundreds of snow canons from @entity245 are used to keep the resort looking its best and there are also @entity249 snow - ploughs and @entity251 snow mobiles but in august 2013 a $ 8.5 million deal with a @entity42 ski - lift manufacturer was blocked by the @entity42 government based on @entity256 laws that prohibit certain export sales to @entity6			2
the communist - regime got around the issue by buying their ski - lifts closer to home			0
‘ in case you are wondering where they got the ski lifts because of the embargo , they brought them in from @entity38			0
i rode on all of the @entity38 ski lifts and they felt safe and stable , ’ mr @entity23 said			2
