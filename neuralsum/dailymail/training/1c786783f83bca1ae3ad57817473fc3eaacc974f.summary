by @entity0 last updated at 1:23 am on 23rd december 2011 as @entity3 ’s largest military base , it is home to more than 12,000 @entity6 personnel and their families			0
so it must have come as a surprise to the soldiers of @entity11 when they discovered that the @entity13 charity single was nowhere to be seen in their local @entity14			1
not least because the whole idea for the record came from a member of the garrison ’s own @entity20 choir of servicemen ’s wives and girlfriends			0
the @entity13 on @entity25 on tuesday			0
their charity single ' @entity26 ' is currently outselling the rest of the top 20 combined but surprise turned to anger when they were told by @entity14 that its store in the @entity34 army base was ‘ too small ’ to stock the song , @entity26 – even though it was big enough for @entity38 ’s @entity37 song , @entity39			1
the ban on the @entity13 single led to heartfelt protests from a battalion of disappointed locals			1
and last night @entity14 was beating a hasty retreat on its decision			0
retired headmistress @entity46 , from nearby @entity47 , tried to buy the single – which is outselling the rest of the @entity50 combined and is expected to be the @entity52 number one – on wednesday			1
‘ they told me the store is n’t big enough , ’ she said			1
‘ well , it ’s big enough to take the money from the military personnel			0
‘ i ’ve never been ' incandescent of @entity47 ' before , but i feel very strongly about this			0
’ mrs @entity46 was forced to buy the single online instead			1
another shopper , @entity61 , of nearby @entity62 , was equally appalled when she and her husband tried to buy the single on monday			1
‘ he was looking for the disc and he caught up with me and said , ' you ’ll not believe it – they do n’t have the single ' , ’ she said			1
the @entity14 in @entity11 claims it is ' too small ' to stock the charity single ‘ i went up to the help desk and they told me the store was too small to stock the @entity13 single			1
i was furious about it			0
this is a @entity14 store that is in the heart of the biggest military base in @entity3			1
‘ they had the @entity37 girls ’ single			1
i do n’t have anything against them , good luck to them , but military servicemen ’s wives work at this @entity14 , and military personnel use the store			2
' given the price of the single , it ’s the kind of thing children would want to buy for their parents who are serving in the forces			2
@entity11 is the largest @entity6 garrison in the world with a population of around 12,000 , plus a large temporary population of soldiers			1
it is said to be the largest army base in @entity3			0
it is not a single fenced base , but several separate barracks around which a town has developed			2
the @entity110 gained its first large supermarket , a @entity14 , in 2000 along with a retail park including a @entity114			0
‘ we have a history of @entity118 service in our family so i was appalled they did not stock the single			1
the girls on the help desk said they would pass my concerns higher up the chain after my complaint			0
’ local businessman @entity127 , who chairs the garrison ’s independent advisory panel , said : ‘ it ’s a great shame they have not got behind this			0
‘ they should be doing what they can to support it			0
' in the face of the onslaught , @entity14 was last night shipping copies of the single to the garrison			1
a spokesman said the supermarket chain ’s customers tended to purchase and download singles online , so it did not generally stock them in its stores			2
but he added : ‘ this is a special charity project we are pleased to be supporting			2
the single is available in 205 of our stores and on december 26 it will be available in 458			2
’ the @entity13 were formed by choirmaster @entity150 for @entity153 programme @entity151			0
he was given the idea by a member of @entity156			0
the single is raising money for the @entity159 and the @entity160 , @entity161			2
the @entity162 said this week that it has agreed to give a sum equivalent to the vat on sales of the single to the appeal .			0
