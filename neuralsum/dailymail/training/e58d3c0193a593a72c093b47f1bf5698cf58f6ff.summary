council leaders across @entity1 are demanding more control as constitutional turmoil over the proposed new terms for @entity5 deepens			1
the leaders of 119 councils warned that voters in @entity1 will not accept greater devolution to @entity5 unless there is a similar redistribution of power south of the border			1
the councils – including 65 controlled by @entity15 , 40 by the conservatives and ten by the @entity17 – want powers over tax and spending similar to those being given to @entity21 in the aftermath of @entity5 ’s no vote in september ’s independence referendum			1
the leaders of 119 councils warned that voters in @entity1 will not accept greater devolution to the @entity21 ( pictured ) unless there is a similar redistribution of power south of the border among those who have issued the warning are the leaders of several big councils in the traditional @entity32 heartlands , including @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , which covers @entity37 ’s constituency of @entity38			1
there is also a growing clamour for ‘ @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws ’ , ensuring legislation that no longer affects @entity5 can not be forced on to the rest of the @entity45 by the votes of @entity5 mps			1
yesterday , @entity15 ’s @entity48 criticised proposals being drawn up by the @entity50 , expected to be unveiled before @entity51 , to ensure the influence of the predominantly @entity47 in @entity5 is reined in			0
speaking to the @entity55 ’s @entity54 , the @entity53 said the prime minister was ‘ trying to play party politics with our constitution and the future of our country ’			2
yesterday , @entity15 ’s @entity48 criticised proposals being drawn up by the @entity50 to ensure the influence of the predominantly @entity47 in @entity5 is reined in			0
he insisted : ‘ the government ’s own @entity62 said there is an issue of fairness around voting – we need to find a way to solve that ... but if you start having different classes of @entity47 , you will destroy the @entity73 and undermine prosperity in every part of our country			0
i ’m not going to be part of that			0
’ but former @entity15 mp @entity78 said : ‘ if @entity15 agree that the @entity5 @entity21 shall fix income tax rates in @entity5 it must also accept that @entity5 mps in @entity82 can no longer vote on income taxation levels for the rest of the @entity45			1
‘ a commitment to devolve income tax levels to @entity21 without simultaneously addressing the perversities of the @entity89 question is frankly outrageous			1
‘ there is a tipping point when the voters in @entity1 will say this far and no further			1
@entity15 seem to be blind to this			0
’ instead of a system of @entity1 votes , which would permanently hobble its powerbase at @entity82 , @entity15 is trying to focus on devolution of power to the regions			1
it has proposed scrapping the @entity100 and replacing it with an elected second chamber of senators representing different parts of the country			0
shadow communities secretary @entity105 said devolution within @entity1 is now inevitable : ‘ devolution is n’t just for @entity5			2
if we want to get the economy moving in all parts of the country , we need to give local communities more power to shape their own future			0
’ the council leaders , in a letter to the @entity117 newspaper , called on chancellor @entity118 to use his autumn statement on wednesday to set out a ‘ new settlement for @entity1 ’ which devolves power from @entity82 and shares out tax and spending across the @entity45 ‘ on a fair basis ’			1
they wrote : ‘ earlier this week , the @entity126 commission [ on @entity5 devolution ] set out a better deal for @entity5 , granting more control over funding and recognising the importance of devolving power down beyond @entity21			2
it ’s @entity1 ’s turn now			2
‘ the people we represent , who look north of the border with envy at the greater control @entity5 are to get ... will expect nothing less			0
’ the leaders also claimed local government could not afford any more austerity cuts			2
‘ funding for services provided by councils has borne the brunt of austerity , while demand continues to rise , ’ they wrote			2
‘ further reductions without radical reform will have a detrimental impact on people ’s quality of life			0
’ however , local government minister @entity155 warned : ‘ local government accounts for a quarter of all public spending and must play its part in paying off the deficit left by the last administration			0
‘ since 2010 , this government has delivered a fair settlement to every part of the country while giving them greater financial independence so they can increase revenue and protect frontline services			0

council leaders want same powers as those promised to @entity21
several big councils in the traditional @entity32 heartlands are among them
there is also a growing clamour for ‘ @entity1 votes for @entity1 laws ’
