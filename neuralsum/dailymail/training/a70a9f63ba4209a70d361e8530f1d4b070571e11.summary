torn apart : the @entity0 is heading for an unprecedented split after @entity2 and @entity3 ( pictured here with @entity8 in 2010 ) forged an alliance to try to force a ' @entity12 law ' through @entity21 the prime minister blamed a ‘ hung @entity21 ’ for his inability to secure backing for his proposals for a @entity26 , which would not require legislation – the first time since the general election in 2010 that he has used the phrase			1
in an extraordinary foretaste of a potential @entity34 coalition after 2015 , mr @entity2 and mr @entity3 agreed to ‘ work together ’ to try to force some form of ‘ @entity12 law ’ through @entity21			1
@entity37 had threatened to hijack several key pieces of @entity40 legislation , including one @entity41 designed to lift the red tape on business and boost the economy , if mr @entity8 did not back down			0
@entity37 and the @entity45 are now expected to table amendments in the @entity47 giving mps the choice of a beefed - up version of @entity52 proposals for a @entity26 , backed in law , or a full @entity41 implementing the recommendations of @entity12 ’s report			1
mr @entity8 lost patience overnight and told mr @entity3 and mr @entity2 in a ‘ tense ’ joint phone call yesterday morning that he saw no point in continuing cross-party talks			1
sources said @entity37 had produced ‘ demand after demand ’ apparently drawn up in close co-operation with the @entity62 campaign group , which wants a @entity12 law , and made clear it was prepared to wreck the government ’s entire legislative programme if it did not get its way			1
the prime minister said his proposals for an independent body , established by @entity26 like the @entity72 , to oversee the system of @entity6 self - regulation would provide ‘ the toughest regulation of the @entity6 that this country has ever seen ’			2

@entity2 ( right ) has formed an ' alliance ' with the @entity45 to try to force a ' @entity12 law ' through @entity21 ' disappointed ' : @entity3 said he was ' disappointed and , indeed , surprised ' mr @entity8 walked away from the cross-party talks he said it was clear that newspapers could refuse to sign up to a system underpinned by statute , as recommended by @entity12 and backed by @entity37 , @entity45 and @entity62			1
‘ the route i have set out is the fastest possible way to deliver the strong self - regulation body that @entity12 proposed that can put in place million - pound fines , prominent apologies and get justice for victims in this country , ’ the prime minister said			2
‘ the deal is there to be done			0
it is the fastest way to get proper justice for victims			0
there ’s no point in producing a system that the @entity6 wo n’t take part in			0
as prime minister i would n’t be fulfilling my duty if i came up with something knowing that it would n’t work			0
’ mr @entity3 said : ‘ i was disappointed and , indeed , surprised that @entity8 has decided to walk away from the cross-party talks , especially when they were making some real progress even as late as yesterday evening			1
this whole issue is a difficult one , striking the right balance between protecting the @entity118 , which is essential , but also protecting ordinary people from unwarranted harassment and bullying by the @entity6			0
’ balance : mr @entity3 said it was ' difficult ' to strike the balance between the @entity118 and ' protecting ordinary people from unwarranted harassment and bullying by the @entity6 ' mr @entity2 said @entity37 and the @entity45 ‘ are determined to carry on working , reaching out to people from across all parties to get a solution that will deliver for the victims , and that will be done obviously through votes in @entity21 ’			1
he added : ‘ i still believe we can do that on a cross-party basis			0
in the end we ’re going to have to go above @entity8 ’s head and work with other conservative mps to see whether we can find a workable solution			2
we obviously have been talking to them over the past few months			0
’ the @entity37 leader said mr @entity8 ’s decision to pull out of cross-party talks was a ‘ historic mistake ’ that would let down the victims of press intrusion			1
senior conservative mp @entity145 , who chairs the @entity147 , said there was a ‘ strong chance ’ that mr @entity8 will be defeated in the @entity47 on monday by the new @entity150			0
@entity52 mp @entity151 said : ‘ the future of press freedom in this country is now under serious threat from an unholy alliance of @entity2 and @entity3			2
the public should be very frightened at the prospect of politicians trying to regulate the @entity6			0
’ @entity160 , a fellow @entity52 member of the committee , accused mr @entity2 and mr @entity3 of stitching up a ‘ squalid little deal ’ that would damage free speech in @entity7			1
hacked off executive director @entity164 said mr @entity8 ’s @entity26 proposals ‘ raises two fingers ’ to those demanding reform in the wake of the exposure of phone - hacking by the @entity6			1
a group of leading industry figures representing @entity7 ’s biggest newspapers , hundreds of regional and local papers and all major magazine publishers , said in a statement that they shared the prime minister ’s frustration at the way in which talks on the future of press regulation had broken down and ‘ legislation has been hijacked ’			1
‘ the prime minister is right to reject statutory regulation of the @entity6 – free of political control for 300 years – as fundamentally wrong in principle and unworkable in practice , ’ they added			0
proposal : the prime minister said his proposals for an independent body , established by @entity26 like the @entity72 , to oversee the system of @entity6 self - regulation would provide ' the toughest regulation of the @entity6 that this country has ever seen ' ‘ the industry has spent many weeks in negotiating a new independent system of self - regulation , based on the @entity12 principles , which provides £ 1million fines and the toughest system of regulation in the western world			2
we have made major concessions in order to reach agreement , although there are elements of the proposed reforms – such as exemplary damages – to which we remain opposed			0
however , this need not stop a new regulator being put in place			0
‘ we agree with the prime minister that matters can not be allowed to drift on and that we need now to deliver real change			0
‘ the @entity7 ’s newspaper and magazine publishing industry will rise to the challenge			2
we are ready to move with speed to establish a new system of tough , independent , effective self - regulation which delivers fully on the @entity12 principles and will provide real protection for members of the public			2
we will aim to get the new regulator up and running as soon as possible			0

@entity8 pulls the plug on cross-party talks over @entity12 proposals
@entity2 and @entity3 agree to ' work together ' to force law through @entity21
@entity37 and @entity45 expected to table ' beefed - up ' amendments
@entity240 , editor of the @entity241 , @entity7 ’s oldest political publication , made clear that it would *boycott* any system of state regulation , no matter what the consequences . ‘ no matter how mps vote , the spectator will not sign up to any plan for state *licensing* of the media , ’ he said .
