the glaciers that accompanied ice ages are responsible for carving out enormous swathes of rock on @entity4 , but these periods of cold weather may have built up its crust too colder spells caused water to be drawn up into glaciers , and in turn this caused sea levels to drop , allowing more magma to seep out from underwater eruptions			1
this , scientists believe , caused thicker sections of crust to emerge during the same period			2
@entity20 researchers say lower sea levels caused by glaciers ( stock image shown ) made the crust thicken			1
during ice ages , sea levels could be up to 330ft ( 100 metres ) lower			1
this is because water is drawn up into the glaciers and ice sheets			1
in turn , this reduced pressure on the ocean floor , allowing more magma to seep out the theory - published in the journal @entity36 - suggests that during an ice age , increased amounts of water are taken up into glaciers , causing sea levels to drop by up to 330ft ( 100 metres )			1
this reduces the pressure on the ocean floor , allowing magma to erupt more easily and spread across the ocean floor more easily			1
at the surface , @entity46 is a motionless and frozen landscape			0
yet hundreds of miles down the @entity4 is moving at a rapid rate , research in may last year showed			0
the study , led by @entity52 and published in @entity4 and @entity53 , explains for the first time why the upward motion of the @entity4 's crust in the @entity57 is currently taking place so quickly			0
gps data collected by the international research team , including experts from @entity52 , @entity62 , and the @entity63 revealed that the land in this region is rising at a phenomenal rate of 0.6 inches ( 15 mm ) a year			0
the effect is due to the glaciers thinning , allowing the land underneath to ' spring ' upwards relatively quickly			0
evidence for magma erupting is known from seafloor spreading centres , reports @entity36			0
this is where plates of ocean crust move apart , allowing magma to erupt outwards into the water			1
on the bottom of the oceans , this forms so - called ' abyssal hills ' , which are ridges hundreds of metres long , separated by valleys , on plates moving away from each other			1
it suggests that climatic effects on the surface of @entity4 can have previously unknown effects on other parts of the planet			0
such is the effect that the oceanic crust can thicken by about 2,625ft ( 800 metres ) during an ice age , about 10 per cent of its total thickness			1
' we know that volcanism has an effect on climate , ' said dr @entity100 , a geophysicist at the @entity101 , @entity20 , and one of the authors of the study , in nature ' what we 're seeing is that climate cycles are also affecting ocean volcanism			2
' they also found that , during warmer times such as today , the production of new crust was stunted			0
the theory - published in the journal @entity36 - suggests that during an ice age , increased amounts of water are taken up into glaciers , causing sea levels to drop by up to 330ft ( 100 metres )			1
this reduces the pressure on the ocean floor , allowing magma to erupt more easily and spread across the ocean floor more easily ( illustrated ) evidence for magma erupting is known from seafloor spreading centres , illustration shown			1
this is where plates of ocean crust move apart , allowing magma to erupt outwards into the water			1
on the bottom of the oceans , this forms so - called ' abyssal hills ' , which are ridges hundreds of metres long the researchers noticed the effect in chains of ' hillocks - knolls or small hills - in the seas between @entity144 and the @entity46			1
they examined two areas of a mid-oceanic ridge between the two regions , surveyed in 2011 and 2013 , by the @entity149 icebreaker @entity148			0
here , a chain of hills about 655ft ( 200 metres ) high lines the sea floor			2
these have been formed by a mixture of seismic activity , sedimentation , volcanoes and sea - floor spreading			2
but a pattern of crustal thickness variations was found to synchronise with 23,000 , 41,000 and 100,000 year glacial cycles - known as @entity164 cycles			0
using a computer model to test their idea , the researchers found the decreased pressure on the mantle would increase the rate of mantle melting			0
more magma would be spilled onto the sea floor , explaining the formation of thick abyssal hills underwater			1
' we know that volcanism has an effect on climate , ' said dr @entity100 , a geophysicist at the @entity101 , @entity20 , and one of the authors of the study , in @entity183			0
' what we 're seeing is that climate cycles are also affecting ocean volcanism			0
' shown is a stock image of lava forming underwater ' step back and think about this : small variations in the orbital parameters of the @entity4 - tilt and eccentricity and wobble - are recorded on the sea floor , ' said dr @entity100 to @entity36 , referring to ice ages			1
' it kind of blows my mind			0
' furthermore , the research may also explain another puzzle about ice ages - why they start gradually but end suddenly			2
it 's possible that increased seafloor eruptions by the decrease in pressure releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere			2
this would warm the atmosphere and ultimately cause the ice sheets to melt			2
' it 's a very seductive idea , and an interesting one , ' said dr @entity215 , a paleoceanographer at the @entity216 , @entity217 , in @entity36			0
' the ice sheet gets so big that it seeds its own destruction			0

@entity20 researchers say lower sea levels caused the crust to thicken
during ice ages sea levels could be up to 330ft ( 100 metres ) lower
this is because water is drawn up into the glaciers and ice sheets
in turn , this reduces pressure on the ocean floor , allowing more magma to seep out from the gaps between plates
this allowed more ' crust ' to form underwater - known as abyssal hills
interestingly , this ultimately caused the ice age to ' self destruct ' , as the increased magma would release more *co2* - and warm the atmosphere
