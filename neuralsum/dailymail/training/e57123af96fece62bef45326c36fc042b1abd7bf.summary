the technology has been deemed exciting enough for @entity1 to have invested around $ 500 million , but until now , details about how @entity3 actually works has remained a mystery			1
now , an extensive patent has not only shown how the augmented reality headset could look and work , it also provides a number of example uses for the secretive technology			1
its @entity13 - based makers said it is a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality , which it calls ' cinematic reality ' , and it could revolutionise how people shop , watch tv and even how doctors operate			1
the patent shows that , in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles , connected to a battery pack			1
it connects to a network , which then connects to a so - called ' passable world model			0
' this model is created using a database of objects in october , @entity3 announced it had raised $ 542 million in a funding round , led by @entity1			1
other investors included @entity38 , the world 's leading phone chipmaker , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43			0

the @entity3 patent also shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists , for example ( pictured ) @entity3 's system claims to be more realistic than the @entity310 ( pictured )			1
the firm was bought last year by @entity312 for $ 2 billion , and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the headset to be launched @entity280 also superimposes information on the periphery of a wearer 's vision			2
@entity312 spent $ 2 billion buying @entity320 last year , which makes a virtual reality headset , mostly aimed at gamers			1
unlike @entity3 's future device , it blocks out the real world around the user			1
gamers hope @entity312 and @entity1 's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology , which would make playing games and watching films more realistic , as well as creating other immersive experiences			1

@entity1 recently led a $ 542 million investment in the @entity3 company
@entity13 - based firm claims to have made a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality , which it calls ' cinematic reality '
until now , very few details about the technology had been revealed
extensive patent shows how the headset could *potentially* look and work
proposed uses include showing scores and details over a sports game
it could also be used to show lists , or turn shopping into a children 's game
elsewhere , doctors could use the headset during complex surgeries
unlike @entity310 , the wearable could *mix* virtual reality with the real world
a release date and price for @entity3 have not been revealed
