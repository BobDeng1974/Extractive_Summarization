by @entity1 reporter an @entity3 woman has ditched her comfortable , fun - loving @entity5 lifestyle to become a traditional housewife in rural @entity7			1
@entity8 , 41 , took a leap of faith last august when she flew to the sub continent to meet a man young enough to be her son who she had fallen in love with over @entity14			1
within months she was married to @entity15 , 25 , and had assumed her new role as a doting housewife - sweeping , cooking , cleaning and mucking in on the family 's farm in an impoverished rural community in @entity23 , @entity7			1
but despite the radical lifestyle change , she insists she is happier than ever			0
the former receptionist at an acupuncture centre said : ' i love my life here with @entity15 - i would n't exchange it for anything in the world			1
' in love : @entity8 , 41 , and her husband @entity15 , 25 , met and fell in love online rural : the pace of life in the remote rural village of @entity51 , @entity7 , is a far cry from the modern homelife @entity8 , left behind in @entity5 home comforts : @entity8 makes some tea for her husband and in - laws , left , and sweeps the courtyard , right , at her house in a village in @entity51 , @entity7 , during a typical day as a housewife mrs @entity34 - who admits she had plenty of relationships back in the @entity3 , but had never found true love - began talking with @entity15 , sixteen years her junior , on the social networking site in february			1
over the next few months the pair grew closer , until one evening @entity15 unexpectedly called			1
she explained : ' @entity15 declared his love to me right there and then on the phone			1
i did n't know how to react , and at first just laughed it off			0
' but after we talked some more , i realised he was serious and so i said if you win my heart , i will consider marrying you			0
we spoke for around three more weeks and it was during that time i decided i wanted to move to @entity7 to be with him			2
' change of pace : @entity8 stands beside a cow at the front yard of her house in a village in @entity51 , @entity7 , as she gets used to a rural existance culture shock : @entity8 stands in front of house old @entity5 home , left , and outside the bed room of her house in a village in @entity51 , @entity7 , right leaving behind her 25 - year - old daughter @entity90 was a heart - wrenching moment , with many friends and family fearing for her safety in @entity7			1
mrs @entity34 , whose parents moved to the @entity3 from @entity96 , said : ' when i walked in and told everyone i had decided to leave and move to @entity7 , they were in complete shock			1
' my daughter was crying , she was in floods of tears			0
she was worried something bad would happen to me			0
' she said @entity7 was unsafe for women			2
i had to turn to her and reassure her everything would be alright			0
hard work : @entity8 has left the creature comforts of an electronic dishwasher behind as she does the dishes by hand at her house in a village in @entity51 , @entity7 , youthful : a young @entity8 , suns herself on a beach in @entity27 , @entity5 ' some people thought @entity15 was a fake , an online scam and that he did n't really exist			1
i ca n't describe the moment i finally saw him at the arrivals gate at @entity122 airport - it was a big relief to finally see him in person			0
' but she admits nothing had prepared her for the culture shock she was about to experience			0
her new home was a modest farm house in @entity130 , a large village over 30 minutes drive from the nearest town			1
mrs @entity34 found the family used cow pat cakes , made by drying out the excrement of the families herd , as fuel			1
and with no inside toilet , a bucket for a shower and cows roaming around the communal area , the lack of amenities was tough to adapt to			1
day to day : @entity8 gets on with the chores at home in her new front yard - a far cry from the @entity5 house home from home : @entity8 , pictured with her husband @entity15 while enjoying their lunch at their house in a village in @entity51 , @entity7 , says she has no regrets about leaving @entity5 she added : ' when i first stepped off the plane it was a complete culture shock			1
' it is stricter here - women have to cover up more			0
' in @entity23 many people live off the land , there are few basic amenities			2
we cook on a stove which is outside , and my living room doubles as the place where we store the cows at night			0
' we sometimes use the bull and cart to ride around , and the toilet is a communal one			0
the shower is just a bucket in a closet sized room with a hole in the floor			2
' if people back home could see where i am living they would think i am crazy			0
' at first it was a real struggle , but soon you realise you do n't need a fancy toilet or power shower to be happy			2
' one of the biggest challenges , says @entity8 , was being accepted among the largely impoverished locals			2
then and now : @entity8 , pictured during her younger days in @entity27 , @entity5 , left , now lives in a remote rural village in @entity7 , where she has adopted the lifestyle of a traditional @entity7 housewife , right family : @entity8 and her mother - in - law @entity198 share a moment together at the front yard of their house in a village in @entity51 , @entity7 home : @entity8 shares this home in a village in @entity51 , @entity7 , with husband @entity15 mrs @entity34 , who immediately ditched her favoured high heels and adopted sandals , saree and headdress , said : ' foreigners are rarely seen in the villages here , and wherever i went a crowd would develop all wanting to catch a glimpse of this outsider			1
' over time i began to get used to it			0
it was a bit like being a celebrity , but they have accepted me as one of their own now			0
' a big part of that was dressing like they do and trying to speak some @entity230			0
in the @entity3 i loved wearing high heels and dressing up for a night out at a club with my friends , but here things are more low key			2
' you ca n't get any of the make - up i 'm used to using and women generally do n't apply much of it anyway , it is an unnecessary cost			0
' the locals respond when you try and fit in and live as they live			0
' in november 2013 @entity15 and @entity8 tied the knot in a traditional @entity245 ceremony , which made headlines in @entity7 's national hindi language media			1

' i am very happy to marry with her			0
' crucially for mrs @entity34 , her mother - in - law @entity198 , 70 , has given the pair her blessings - and even endorsed her housewife skills			1
speaking in @entity230 , @entity198 said : ' i am happy my son married a foreigner			0
