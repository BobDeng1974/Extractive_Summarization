the captain considered getting the co-pilot to take control but concluded that , given the time available and the challenging conditions , his best course of action was to move his right hand from the power levers on to the yoke to regain control			2
the report went on : ' he did this , but with power still applied and possibly a gust affecting the aircraft , a normal touchdown was followed by a bounce , from which the aircraft landed heavily			0
' no - one was hurt and the plane was not damaged in the incident on the evening of february 12 this year			0
the @entity31 reported that the captain had said that in future he would be more cautious about checking the attachment on his prosthesis as he may have dislodged the latching mechanism			0
