by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 2 april 2012 updated : 02:25 est , 3 april 2012 being called upon to design for the @entity1 is likely to be the highlight of any fashion designer 's career			1
but it could also herald the most daunting , indeed , terrifying moment in a couturier 's life			0
as revealed in a new book , @entity1 : reigning in style by @entity10 , reprised in this weekend ’s @entity11 , to be asked to supply sketches to the @entity1 was a daunting prospect			2
dressing the queen : @entity15 , who designed the blue creation worn by the @entity1 here , said he was frequently disappointed to see his ' beautiful designs ' ruined by what he called the @entity1 's ' ugly handbags ' @entity23 , milliners and other designers would be contacted by the @entity1 ’s dressers and asked to provide sketches			1
frequently , they would receive no further detail – no hint as to the nature of the event , or even the time of year the outfit would be required for – making it very difficult to supply something precisely to her requirements			0
those who did pass muster would then have to attend a fitting with the @entity1 – a prospect that was in itself widely felt to be terrifying			2
daunting : @entity39 says his first fitting with the @entity1 was one of the most terrifying moments of his life @entity10 explains that upon his royal appointment in the late 1960s , the milliner @entity46 was briefed ahead of his fitting with the @entity1 by one of her most trusted designers , @entity15			1
he told @entity39 : ‘ do n’t touch the @entity1 , do n’t ask questions and do n’t turn your back ’			2
@entity10 tells how , on the day in question , @entity53 - born @entity46 came into difficulties with the edict that he must n’t turn his back			2
‘ @entity1 was standing at the end of a long room , ’ she reports him as saying			0
' i advanced , did my chat and my thing			0
when it was time to depart i was rooted to the spot			0
i thought that if i walked backwards i would fall over the furniture of one of the corgis			0
' @entity1 spotted my dilemma and turned her back on me to ask @entity70 [ the @entity1 ’s dresser ] to fetch some specific shoes - giving me the opportunity to withdraw			0
' royal favourite : princess @entity75 in a @entity46 hat @entity39 designed five hats for the @entity1 's tour of @entity79 and @entity80 , and went on to design for the @entity1 on numerous occasions			1
he was awarded a royal warrant in 1974 , as well as an lvo in the @entity1 's 1999 birthday honours list , making the hard work and trauma worthwhile			1
he has also designed headpieces for eight further royals , including the @entity90 and @entity75 , @entity75			0
trusted : sir @entity15 designed for the @entity1 from the 50s until 2002 , a year before his death - and advised @entity46 on his royal fitting for @entity15 ’ part , despite his privileged position as one of the @entity1 ’s favourite couturiers – he designed gowns for the @entity1 from the early part of the 50s right up to a year before his death , in 2003 – it was not always a bed of roses for a designer with a ferociously specific design aesthetic			1
@entity10 tells how @entity15 , along with the @entity1 ’s other couturiers , despaired of @entity1 ’s tendency to pair their outfits with what they deemed to her ‘ ugly ’ handbags that blighted their designs			1
she says that the @entity1 ’s formidable dresser @entity70 wanted to ensure no design house dominated the @entity1 ’s wardrobe , so she would outsource the design of hats , shoes and handbags to other designers which would then be matched to her outfits			0
@entity15 , she says , ‘ complained bitterly ’ about ‘ ugly handbags ’ that ruined his ‘ beautiful designs ’			1
his solution , which he claims was a popular strategy among her majesty ’s dress designers , was to give the @entity1 handbags they considered to be beautiful in the hopes she would choose to carry those instead			1
