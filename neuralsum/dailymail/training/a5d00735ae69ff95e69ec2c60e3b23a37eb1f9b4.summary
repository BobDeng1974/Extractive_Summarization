by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 22 march 2013 middle - aged men who physically act out their dreams while asleep are five times more likely to develop dementia , researchers have found			1
moving around , walking , talking or hitting out while asleep is the strongest predictor that a man will develop dementia with @entity10 bodies – the second most common form of dementia in the elderly after @entity14 's			1
another example would be unconsciously mimicking the action of holding a steering wheel while dreaming about driving a car			1
physically acting out dreams is a condition known as rapid eye movement ( @entity22 ) sleep behaviour disorder			1
middle - aged men who acts out their dreams while asleep are five times more likely to develop dementia in old age researchers at the @entity28 , in the @entity26 , found that men with the condition are five times more likely to develop this form of dementia than those who display other risk factors currently used to make the diagnosis , such as hallucinations			1
@entity22 sleep is the phase of sleep during which the most vivid dreams occur , while @entity22 behaviour disorder is the name given to the condition that causes the loss of the normal muscle paralysis that occurs during @entity22 sleep			1
this precursor can appear as much as three decades or more before a diagnosis of dementia with @entity48 is made , the researchers said			2
this type of dementia accounts for ten per cent of all cases in the elderly			1
for most people , dreams occur purely in the mind while the body is resting			2
however , people who suffer from @entity22 sleep behaviour disorder physically act out their dreams while they are asleep			1
they physically move around , walk , talk or hit out in their sleep			2
it is often not diagnosed until it starts to prove a danger to the sufferer 's bed partner			0
studies of animals suggest that the symptoms of @entity22 sleep behaviour disorder may be caused by lesions on the brain stem ( the area of the brain which joins the spinal cord )			1
the disorder can be treated quite successfully using medications such as antidepressants			0
. however , the link between dementia with @entity10 bodies and the sleep disorder is not as strong in women , they added			1
researchers at @entity28 in @entity84 and @entity85 examined magnetic resonance imaging ( @entity88 ) scans of the brains of 75 patients diagnosed with probable dementia with @entity10 bodies			0
the researchers then checked the patients ' histories to see if the sleep disorder had been diagnosed in them while they were under @entity28 care			2
‘ while it is , of course , true that not everyone who has this sleep disorder develops dementia with @entity10 bodies , as many as 75 to 80 per cent of men with dementia with @entity10 bodies in our @entity28 database did experience @entity22 sleep behaviour disorder , ' said lead investigator dr @entity108 , a neuroscientist at @entity28			1
' so it is a very powerful marker for the disease			0
' she added that the study 's findings could improve the diagnosis of this form of dementia and that this can lead to better treatment			0
‘ screening for the sleep disorder in a patient with dementia could help clinicians diagnose whether they are suffering from dementia with @entity10 bodies or alzheimer 's disease , ’ she says			1
‘ it can sometimes be very difficult to tell the difference between these two dementias , especially in the early stages , but we have found that only two to three per cent of patients with alzheimer 's disease have a history of this sleep disorder			2
’ once the diagnosis of dementia with @entity10 bodies is made , patients can use drugs that can treat the related cognitive issues , dr @entity132 says			0
no cure is currently available			0
dementia with @entity10 bodies affects men and women equally and is most prevalent in the over 65s			2
red areas on a brain scan are a warning of alzheimer 's disease			0
green areas are healthy brain lewy bodies , named after the doctor who discovered them , are small spherical protein deposits found in nerve cells			0
their presence in the brain interferes with the normal functioning of the brain – it is yet to be established why they occur in the brain and how they cause damage			0
dementia with @entity10 bodies is a degenerative disease with symptoms including problems with alertness , spatial disorientation , difficulty planning ahead and memory problems			0
people with this form of dementia sometimes also develop symptoms including slowness , muscle stiffness , trembling of the limbs , a tendency to shuffle when walking , loss of facial expression , and changes in the strength and tone of the voice			0
the research comes just after another study which found that disrupted sleep could be an early sign of alzheimer 's disease			0
researchers at @entity189 found that people with early stage @entity14 often suffer disrupted sleep before they display other symptoms of the condition .			2

physically acting out dreams is best predictor of common type of dementia
for example , dreaming about driving while mimicking the action of steering
up to 80 per cent of men with the condition , known as @entity22 sleep behaviour disorder , go on to suffer dementia
