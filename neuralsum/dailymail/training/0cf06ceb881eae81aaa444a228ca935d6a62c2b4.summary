@entity0 was photographed laughing and smiling today as his lawyer attempted to suppress major evidence in his murder trial			1
@entity0 's lawyers are trying to get evidence from the former football star 's cell phone that shows he was in contact with the man he allegedly murdered , @entity9 , in the days before he was shot in 2013 , thrown out in court			1
@entity9 , a semi-professional football player from @entity12 , @entity13 , had been dating the sister of @entity16 's fianc√©e at the time of his death			1
the prosecution told the judge the defense had agreed to turn over the phone shortly after @entity16 was convicted , arguing against their attempts to suppress this crucial evidence in their case			1
the defense , however , now maintains the phone was turned over under a ' false claim of legal authority ' and is seeking to have evidence from it thrown out			0
in prior court filings , they have said the warrant did not authorize the phone 's seizure from @entity16 's attorneys or from their law office and that the seizure was illegal			2
prosecutors have alleged that @entity16 and @entity9 exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that @entity16 and two accomplices picked up @entity9 in @entity12 before driving him to @entity52 and killing him			2
' they were clearly in communication with each other , setting up a meeting , as it appeared , ' @entity53 said at the hearing			0
silent : @entity16 did not address the court or speak at all during the proceedings victim : @entity16 has been charged with shooting @entity9 ( above ) @entity16 declined to allow authorities to search the phone at the police department a few hours after @entity9 's body was found , but his attorneys said he would maintain its contents and turn it over if a warrant was produced , assistant district attorney @entity53 testified during the hearing in @entity72			1
@entity53 said he learned that @entity16 no longer had the phone and that he had given it to his lawyers only when the prosecutor called to inform them that search warrants were being executed at the former @entity78 's home			2
the defense has said in court filings that authorities learned where the phone was after @entity16 told them during what they call an unlawful interrogation at his house			0
the hearing is to continue wednesday			0
@entity16 also is charged in another case with the murder of two @entity12 men in 2012 after a brief encounter at a nightclub			0
he has pleaded not guilty in that case too			0
this is not the first time @entity16 has been spotted laughing and smiling in court , as the former @entity98 did the same when a date for his trial was set back in june .			1
