@entity0 famously penned the wisdom that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet			0
so what exactly is in a name ? apparently quite a bit , at least according to this list compiled by @entity8 , detailing the most definitive monikers likely to brand your child a ' bogan '			1
but first , a definition			0
bogan / ˈboʊgən / ( say ‘ bohguhn ) @entity15 ( mildly derogatory ) 1			2
a person , generally from an outer suburb of a city or town from a lower socio - economic background , viewed as uncultured ; originally typified as wearing ugg boots and tights , or footy shorts and thongs in public and having a mullet hairstyle			2
a harmless and often entertaining local legend , the bogan is as much a part of the nation 's image as bbq 's and beaches			2
but is the cultural legend of the ever - present bogan possessive of characteristics a parent would want for their new child ? whilst parents can often be overwhelmed when searching for potential names for their progeny , it is best to choose wisely			1
a baby 's sobriquet is , after all , branded onto birth certificates for all eternity			1
what does a name say about a person , or mean for a baby 's future ? it can seem safe to settle on a compromise of a traditional name spelled a new way , or to call a child after a person or place which evokes hopes for the future , but what do the names really mean for a new baby ? guru 's of @entity29 culture @entity77 and @entity80 poked fun at the prolific trend of creating a unique baby name			1
@entity84 was the butt of many commentators jokes , as was the intention			0
and it seems that no young girl is complete without her very own apostrophe these days			2
@entity91 's @entity90 can attest to that , and with names such as @entity94 making the cut , one can only wonder where the symbol might work its way into			0
as the list , which pokes fun at quite offensively and outrageously bogan titles , proves , getting adventurous with baby names may be fun , but perhaps not always wise			1
@entity91 's creation @entity103 : " it 's spelled like @entity106 , but i added the apostrophe " boys : 1			0
vegas recently , various spellings of common names such as @entity131 and @entity132 , or @entity133 and @entity134 , have all paved the way for names which make the list such as @entity122 ( @entity138 )			1
@entity123 , @entity112 , @entity114 and @entity139 all seem to fall into an ' aspirational ' category of wanting fame , fortune , or glamour for one 's child			1
so here is a selection of the top names , with commentary from @entity150 included ( try not to laugh )			0
@entity115 , @entity139 , @entity117 , @entity151 and more bogan baby names ! the @entity154 registry of @entity155 recorded that there were 6,932 unique girls names and 5,965 unique boys names registered in 2013			1
@entity159 was a unique name growing in popularity , with 199 baby boys given the name last year			0
there were varied spellings of @entity159 , with 140 boys were named @entity167 and 32 named @entity168			0
for girls , @entity169 was a popular choice for girls with 332 plus variations including @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
director and registrar @entity180 noted that parents choose names for a range of reasons including honouring their family , tradition and popular culture , the @entity153 's website said			0
whilst a bogan baby name is not a death sentence , and may even be a convenient conversation starter as the children get older , these names will certainly draw attention and probably questions			1
winning gold in this particular event , which classifies as almost @entity197 in the gymnastic - like contortions of regular names , is perhaps not something to aim for after all			1
how have you chosen your children 's names ? making a name unique can be tough - so many parents settle for unique spelling instead			2

*hilarious* names for new babies
**misspell*ings* , apostrophes , and more !
does your child 's name make the top of the bogan list ?
what does a name mean for a baby 's future ?
caprice : @entity229 for **“** *impulsive* change of mind **”** , @entity226 *recalls* a shiny @entity114 sedan and a clear - *stilettoed* *stripper* all at once . not the classiest *associations* to be made with your daughter , but each to their own .
@entity237 : when you take an entirely *respectable* name like @entity241 and deform it so it sounds like you **’**re missing your front teeth , you gots to be bogan .
@entity115 : *ah* , a *misspell* of the already *mega-bogan* , money - *grubbing* name @entity246 . you **’**d better be ready for a *massive* five - finger *dollar* - sign ring and a gold tooth on this kid .
vegas : while it **’**s been a tight race down this list , i do believe that naming your baby girl after the *cheapest* , *tawdriest* , most *debaucherous* city in the world takes the bogan cake .
@entity117 : sure , why not name your child after a bad - ass boxer with a face tattoo who did hard time for an *unspeakable* crime ( *allegedly* ) ? oh , but use his last name ‘ cause dats mo **’** bad - ass than plain ol **’** **“** @entity269 **”** .
@entity125 : as if naming your daughter @entity271 is n**’**t bad enough , you also feel the need to insert a completely random apostrophe in the *middle* of it ? similar *specimens* include @entity277 and @entity278 , but at least the apostrophe actually *replaces* a letter in these cases . ( @entity282 : that **’**s what apostrophes do ) .
