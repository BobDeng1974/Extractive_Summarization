by @entity0 last updated at 6:24 pm on 28th february 2012 skipping regular dental check - ups could end up costing you ten times as much money in the long run , according to a report by the @entity6			1
more and more @entity7 are checking into the @entity8 with complaints such as toothache , which could easily have been prevented and at a far lower cost			0
the number of @entity8 visits nationwide for dental problems increased 16 per cent from 2006 to 2009 the report showed , and analyst fear the trend is set to continue			1
costly : people who forgo regular dental checks or do n't brush their teeth regularly could face heightened costs for @entity8 treatment			1
preventive dental care such as routine teeth cleaning can cost $ 50 to $ 100 , versus $ 1,000 for emergency room treatment that may include painkillers for aching cavities and antibiotics from resulting infections			1
these infections can be dangerous , especially in young children , who may develop fevers and dehydration from preventable dental conditions			0
in @entity35 , for example , 200 children were hospitalized in 2006 for those types of infections			0
hospital information from 24 states was analysed , as well as data from the federal @entity40 and studies on dental care			0
researchers claim the problem stems from a shortage of dentists , particularly those willing to treat @entity49 patients			1
in @entity35 , for example , only 10 per cent of dentists participate in the programme			2

emergency rooms are not generally staffed by dentists and are not equipped to deal with dental problems , meaning that many patients end up returning when they can not find or afford follow up treatment			1
@entity81 , director of @entity84 's children 's dental campaign , added : ‘ emergency rooms are really the canary in the coal mine			2
if people are showing up in the @entity8 for dental care , then we 've got big holes in the delivery of care			0
‘ it 's just like pouring money down a hole			0
it 's the wrong service , in the wrong setting , at the wrong time			0

@entity101 on emergency room treatment jumps 16 *%*
