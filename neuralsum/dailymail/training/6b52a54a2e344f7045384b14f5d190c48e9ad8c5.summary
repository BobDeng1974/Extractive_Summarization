i like to think of myself as relatively quick - witted , but i started having serious doubts about my cleverness as i stood handcuffed to my new @entity4 friend , trying get out of a prison cell			1
it was n't a real prison cell , which is why i was n't having a panic attack			1
but the handcuffs were real , and being chained to another person while searching a small room for keys and clues as a clock ticked down became frustrating pretty quickly			1
believe it or not , this was all part of a game			0
real - life room escape attractions began opening nearly a decade ago in @entity19 and @entity20 , but they 've been popping up in @entity21 over the past few years			1
@entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) are handcuffed together as they prepare to play a game at @entity26 the quest in @entity28 , @entity29 @entity30 , left , and writer @entity31 try to unlock a box as they play a game at @entity26 the attractions trace their origins back to escape - the - room video games , where players were trapped and forced to use clues and objects in their surroundings to get out			1
now that concept has moved into the real world			1
escape the @entity27 opened in @entity28 in july			2
they offer two games — apartment 101 and @entity45 — with @entity46 coming soon			2
groups of two to four have an hour to solve the puzzle and win their freedom			0
i participated in @entity45 , joining a group of expat @entity4 in their mid- 20s — @entity30 , @entity22 and @entity23 — who moved to @entity29 within the past two years			0
their @entity52 was heavily accented , and my @entity4 is nonexistent , adding a language barrier to a challenge that only about 20 percent of groups complete successfully , according to escape the quest manager @entity58			2
as @entity22 later remarked , ' you do n't understand us , and we understand 50 percent of yours			0
' so we were off to a good start			0
@entity22 ( left ) , @entity23 ( center ) , and @entity30 ( right ) pose for photos in prison garb in the @entity28 game @entity67 @entity22 and @entity23 prepare to play a game at @entity26 while handcuffed together in @entity28 to begin , @entity58 explained that @entity45 actually includes two rooms and that my new friends and i would be paired off , one pair locked in each room			1
we would first have to get all four into one room and then all escape together			1
@entity30 spoke the best @entity52 , so he went with me			0
we were all handcuffed to our partners and locked in our cells			2
i promised @entity58 i would n't give away any secrets , but i will say @entity30 and i did eventually find a handcuff key , probably much later than we should have			0
by working with @entity22 and @entity23 through a wall , we even managed to get them into our room			2
and by briefly speaking in their native tongue , @entity30 and @entity22 figured out a math riddle that set us free with about 5 minutes to spare			0
i felt useless at that final math part , but even the third - string quarterback gets a ring when his team wins the @entity90 , so i 'm counting it as a win			2
after escaping , @entity30 , @entity22 and @entity23 donned old - timey , black - and - white prisoner outfits for a photo op. they agreed they had fun and that it was a unique experience they 'd recommend to others			2
@entity22 looks for clues how to open the small door as he plays a game at @entity27 @entity58 , manager of the @entity26 , poses at the attraction in @entity28 , @entity29 ' it was the first time seeing something like this , ' @entity22 said			1
' it was very good			0
' @entity58 said the escapes , which start at $ 60 a group , were designed to appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds			2
besides groups of friends , @entity58 said it 's also common to host families and even co-workers using it for team - building			0
but she added the potentially stressful room escapes can be poison to a budding romance			1
' you know when it does n't work ? ' @entity58 said			0
' on a first date			0
' while room escape attractions are more stressful than actually scary , they 're catching the attention of more traditional haunted house operators and theme parks			1
@entity131 , a board member of the @entity132 and director of @entity134 in @entity135 , said he expects room escapes to feature prominently at a national trade show in @entity138 next spring			1
' you 're going to see a lot of overlap , where companies and individuals doing haunted attractions are also going to be doing these types of events in the off season , ' @entity131 said , adding that room escapes can be popular year - round , not just around @entity149			1
the challenge of room escape attractions is volume			1
' you have to get a lot of people through in a night to make the finances work , ' @entity131 said			0
but traditional haunted attractions often feature multiple events , which could easily include a room escape , @entity131 said			1
@entity159 , president of @entity160 , believes the room escape concept can be modified to accommodate more participants			1
' we see it as something that will come into the parks bigtime , ' @entity159 said			0
' it will come in on a larger scale			0
you 'll have large teams of people coursing through different games			0
' theme parks are always looking for new ideas , @entity159 said , and the critical thinking and interactivity featured in room escapes is appealing			1
' the concept is limitless to the story , ' @entity159 said			0
' so as long you have creative people , this can go on forever			0

players are put in rooms such as prison cells or mental *hospitals* and must search for keys and clues to escape
