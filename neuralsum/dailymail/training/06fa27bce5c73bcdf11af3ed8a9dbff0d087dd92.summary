just 96,000 @entity1 jobs were added in august in a bleak monthly jobs report as 368,000 left the workforce , bringing labour market participation down to its lowest level for 31 years and dealing a blow to president @entity8 ’s re-election chances			1
the national unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 per cent , down from 8.2 per cent , but this was only because so many people gave up looking for work			1
if the participation rate had not dropped so precipitously , unemployment would have risen to 8.4 per cent			1
factory employment fell by the most in two years and temporary - help companies eliminated positions for the first time in five months			2
the 69.9 per cent labor force participation rate for men is at lowest level recorded since the @entity1 government began tracking it in 1948			1
according to @entity25 of the @entity26 , the unemployment rate would be 11.2 per cent if the labour force participation rate had remained what it was when @entity8 took office in january 2009			1
the @entity1 @entity30 also said that 41,000 fewer jobs were created in june and july than previously reported			2
president @entity8 was made aware of the figures before he took the stage to deliver his prime - time address at the @entity36 convention on thursday night , which could account for his sometimes grim demeanour as he spoke			1
for every net new job created , nearly four @entity1 gave up looking for work entirely			2
this is more of the same for middle class families who are suffering through the worst economic recovery since the @entity53			2
' after 43 straight months of unemployment above eight per cent , it is clear that president @entity8 just has n't lived up to his promises and his policies have n't worked			1
we are n’t better off than they were four years ago			2
my plan for a stronger middle class will create 12 million new jobs by the end of my first term			2
@entity1 deserves new leadership that will get our economy moving again			2
' on thursday night , @entity8 laid out his case for being re-elected to a second term by comparing himself to @entity71 , who won an unprecedented four presidential elections and led @entity1 to recovery after the @entity53			1
stalling : the growth of new jobs has taken a significant dip compared to the beginning of the year the grim economic data came as @entity8 and @entity43 were deadlocked in the national opinion polls in a race that has been too close to call for many months			1
it was the last opportunity for either man to use a defined ' moment ' to change the trajectory of the race before the three presidential debates in october			2
' and the truth is , it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades			2
it will require common effort , shared responsibility , and the kind of bold , persistent experimentation that @entity71 pursued during the only crisis worse than this one			0
' early in the speech , he lit into his opponents , saying all the @entity99 have ' to offer is the same prescription they ’ve had for the last 30 years : " have a surplus ? try a tax cut			1
deficit too high ? try another			0
feel a cold coming on ? take two tax cuts , roll back some regulations , and call us in the morning ! " ' all smiles : @entity8 and his family were optimistic about the future at the convention last night where 's my hope ? the 69.9 per cent labor force participation rate for men is at lowest level ever recorded can @entity8 save @entity1 's economy as @entity71 did during the @entity53 ? can @entity8 save @entity1 's economy as @entity71 did during the @entity53 ? now share your opinion @entity8 's address , switched from a 74,000 - seater stadium to a 20,000 - seater arena ostensibly because of the weather but amid indications there were problems filling seats , brought the three - day democratic convention to a close			1
judging by the reaction of the crowd , @entity8 's speech paled into insignificance compared to the rollicking address by former president @entity136 on wednesday night and the emotional , affecting speech by his wife @entity138 on tuesday			1
it was also not as rousing as vice president @entity141 's speech just beforehand			1
@entity8 is attempting to frame the election not as a referendum on his four - year term , during which unemployment has risen to 8.3 per cent , leaving more than 23 million @entity1 out of work , but as a choice between him and @entity43 , the @entity99 nominee			1
' on every issue , the choice you face wo n’t be just between two candidates or two parties , ' he said			0
' it will be a choice between two different paths for @entity1			0
a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future			0
' not so good : the unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 per cent but this was only because so many people gave up looking for work recalling his speech at the 2004 convention , he said : ' eight years later , that hope has been tested - by the cost of war ; by one of the worst economic crises in history ; and by political gridlock that ’s left us wondering whether it ’s still possible to tackle the challenges of our time			1
' he needed more time , he insisted , to fix things			0
' i wo n’t pretend the path i ’m offering is quick or easy			0
you did n’t elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear , ' the president said			1
' you elected me to tell you the truth			0
and the truth is , it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades			0
' although his demeanour hardly showed it , @entity8 tried to strike an optimistic note by saying : ' but know this , @entity1 : our problems can be solved			1
our challenges can be met			0
the path we offer may be harder , but it leads to a better place			0
i ’m asking you to chose that future			0
' comparison : @entity8 invoked the spirit of president @entity71 who led @entity1 out of the @entity53 in an earnest request for four more years , he said : ' but know this , @entity1 : our problems can be solved			1
our challenges can be met			0
the path we offer may be harder , but it leads to a better place			0
' and i ’m asking you to choose that future			0
i ’m asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country – goals in manufacturing , energy , education , national security , and the deficit ; a real , achievable plan that will lead to new jobs , more opportunity , and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation			0
' that ’s what we can do in the next four years , and that ’s why i ’m running for a second term as @entity225			0
' this november 's election , he argued , will represent ' the clearest choice of any time in a generation ' between two different visions			0
' over the next few years , big decisions will be made in @entity232 , on jobs and the economy ; taxes and deficits ; energy and education ; war and peace – decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our children ’s lives for decades to come			1
@entity71 dominated @entity1 politics for the 12 years of his presidency and beyond			0
he is commonly recognised as the greatest @entity36 president and , along with @entity249 and @entity250 , one of the three greatest @entity1 presidents			2
not only did he bring @entity1 out of the depression , he oversaw the introduction of the @entity255 social programmes , laid the foundations for the @entity257 and led the country in the @entity259 after the @entity261 bombing of @entity262 , dying just when victory was in sight			0
@entity8 also laid out a series of ' goals for @entity1 ' in a second term			1
these will include creating a million new manufacturing jobs by the end of 2016 , doubling exports by the end of 2014 and cutting net oil imports in half by 2020 .			0

lowest workforce participation rate since *september* 1981
*jobless* rate drops to 8.1 per cent but only because workforce *shrinks*
