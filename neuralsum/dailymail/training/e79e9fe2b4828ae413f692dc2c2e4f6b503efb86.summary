' our strategy was to work hand in hand with the local council , the ecologists and arboriculturists and this ensured that everyone and everything was considered from the outset			0
' even the badgers were provided with a brand new five - star home - built out of oak - and other wildlife was politely asked to ‘ stand aside ’ for a few months whilst we undertook the construction in the most considerate manner			1
' not a tree was felled nor a tree - root disturbed			0
' the design and project team also worked in harmony to create these completely unique buildings which would blend into the natural habitat and create the absolute minimum footprint in every conceivable way			0
masterpiece : 12 pads are built upon stilts to make guests feel like they are sleeping in the trees hidden : the entrance to one of the luxury pods ' the valley itself is being allowed to recover naturally and in a very short space of time this haven of wildlife will once again provide the most magical outlook and backdrop for couples and families all looking to escape from the real world and be close to nature in the most luxurious manner			1
' the project included general landscaping and the building of a walled garden .			0
