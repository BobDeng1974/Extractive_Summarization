by @entity0 last updated at 1:34 pm on 6th january 2012 thousands of roads are to be reclassified as too dangerous to prevent fresh @entity3 chaos in the countryside			1
from april , ministers will hand councils the new powers to try and prevent crashes and traffic jams on unsuitable routes			1
since the explosion in @entity3 sales , hundreds of villages and country roads have been dogged by lorries and car drivers who follow their in car computer ’s guidance to the letter			1
satellite navigation systems will now tell drivers if the road is unsuitable for lorries this means they often end up stuck in cul - de - sacs or in town or village centres that are unsuitable for large vehicles			1
town halls will no longer have to apply each time to @entity33 for permission to reclassify routes			1
the new information will be passed on to the @entity3 firms to update their software			1
to ram home the message , transport minister @entity42 is to host a special government ‘ sat nav summit ’ in early march aimed at ending the misery caused when lorry and car drivers blindly follow out - of - date directions from their satnavs			1
the changes will stop satnav systems sending lorries on shortcuts down unsuitable country lanes roads which were considered major routes decades ago may now be in busy built up villages and towns , said a @entity60 spokesman			1
transport minister mr @entity42 said : ‘ out - of - date directions mean misdirected traffic - a scourge of local communities			1
it is vital highway authorities , mapping companies and satnav manufacturers work more closely together to provide drivers with accurate , up - to - date information on traffic restrictions such as narrow roads or low bridges			1
this will help prevent huge lorries from being sent down inappropriate roads and ensure motorists are given the best possible directions			1
’ a huge lorry is pictured jammed and twisted down a narrow lane , just yards from an ancient @entity83 building roads which were considered major routes decades ago may now be in busy built up villages and towns , said a @entity60 spokesman officials say the problem is exacerbated by motorists who fail to update their own satnav maps , either because they forget or are unaware they can do so			1
but the @entity90 warned that the measures to reclassify roads could lead to a ‘ mismatch ’ of road types from one county to another which will be ‘ confusing ’ for satnav mapping companies and drivers alike			2
the @entity100 said better signs and ‘ a good map ’ would help more			2
@entity100 director of policy and research @entity103 said : ‘ while we welcome the ‘ @entity108 ’ , high quality and consistent signposting will always be the best way to ensure that drivers get the information they require when and where they need it most			2
’ an articulated delivery lorry stuck in a narrow street after following directions into @entity114 , @entity115 1			2
september 2009 : a driver whose car was left teetering on the edge of a 100ft cliff after following his satnav was ordered to pay nearly £ 900 for driving without due care and attention			2
@entity125 , 43 , nearly plunged down the cliff in his @entity127 after obeying instructions which sent him along a steep , narrow path , in @entity130 , @entity131 in march 2009.2			2
june 2009 : a 79 - year old retired banker was taken the wrong way to hospital through country lanes twice by ambulance crews , due to faulty satnav devices			0
the ' anomaly ' in the system led to @entity140 enduring a 45 - minute trip to accident & emergency at @entity144 both times when it should only have taken 20 minutes			0
but separate ambulance crews in separate vehicles told his wife of 55 years , @entity148 , that they had to use satnav as that was the rule.3			0
september 2008 : a crematorium boss saw four funerals disrupted in one afternoon by lorries sent the wrong way due to out - of - date satnav information			0
@entity155 said the @entity156 caused ' absolute chaos ' after being directed down a lane to @entity159 , in west @entity160			0
april 2008 : a minibus owned by a taxi firm called @entity163 was left stranded after a satellite navigation system guided it into a river			0
the driver was on his way to collect a fare in @entity170 , near @entity171 , @entity172 , when he took a wrong turn into the @entity174			0
march 2008 : a taxi satnav blunder left the @entity177 - supporting daughter of @entity178 disappointed after she was dropped off at the wrong @entity179			0
after being picked up from the @entity178 's @entity182 estate near @entity183 , the teenager found herself in a remote village near @entity185 , more than 200 miles away from the @entity187 ' home			0
december 2007 : office workers on a @entity190 shopping trip to @entity191 were taken to the wrong country after a satnav error diverted their coach seven hours off course			0
instead of arriving in the @entity191 city of @entity201 , 50 members of @entity197 and @entity198 sports and social club were diverted 98 miles away to a village , of the same name , in @entity204 , leaving them only two hours to shop after the driver corrected his mistake			0
march 2007 : a coachload of schoolchildren due to visit @entity210 were instead driven around for five hours in traffic after the driver using satnav ended up at @entity210 , in @entity214 , north @entity215			0
the children , aged around eight and from @entity217 in @entity218 , @entity219 , never got to visit the attraction that day after a teacher called a halt to the trip .			0
