by @entity0 last updated at 10:10 pm on 3rd january 2012 indestructible cat @entity1 caused a sensation when she miraculously survived two attempts to put her down in a gas chamber last autumn			1
now the feline 's found a new home where she 'll be much safer			0
it also seems @entity9 , @entity10 , may soon close its carbon monoxide chamber in the face of opposition from volunteers at the local animal shelter , whose cause has been promoted by the cat			1
they claim lethal sodium pentobarbital injections are cheaper and more suitable than the ‘ inhumane and expensive ’ gas chamber			1
it follows the double - survival of stray black cat @entity1 in october			1
alive : indestructible cat @entity1 miraculously survived two attempts to put her down in a gas chamber in @entity10			1
she is pictured with animal shelter volunteer @entity27 and has now been found a permanent home staff at the @entity10 animal shelter made the decision to euthanise @entity1 after 30 days because no one had adopted her and there was no space to continue to keep her			1
but she survived her trip into the carbon monoxide gas chamber			1
after the attempt to gas her she still showed signs of life , so a further attempt to put her down was made			2
the astonished employee ran the gas once more before placing @entity1 in a plastic bag and leaving her body in a cooler , reported the @entity46			1
less than an hour later the same staff member was placing the body of a dog in the freezer when he heard a ‘ meow ’ , reported @entity52			0
tearing open the bag he found her looking terrified but alive			0
after finding her alive in the bag , the workers agreed that they should not try to kill the cat again			0
she was put up for adoption by an animal welfare group and they found her a permanent home			2
survivor : @entity1 had originally been taken to the @entity64 by officers because she was a stray , though workers believed she had been someone 's pet ' it was just one of those things where they thought this cat obviously really wants to live , ' @entity9 spokesman @entity70 said at the time			1
' let ’s give it a chance to find a permanent home			0
' despite the strange incident , the shelter stood by its euthanasia methods at the time , which are recommended by the @entity83			2
' she ’s pretty tough , obviously			0
she ’s definitely got some will to live ' @entity27 ‘ we ’ve never had an instance like this since we started using this method so it does work , ’ a shelter spokesman said in october			2
‘ it ’s actually very human and it ’s very quick			0
this is just an anomaly			0
’ @entity1 had been taken to the @entity64 by officers because she was a stray , though workers believed she had been someone ’s pet			2
‘ she ’s pretty tough , obviously , ’ @entity99 volunteer @entity27 told the @entity46 at the time			0
‘ she ’s definitely got some will to live			0
