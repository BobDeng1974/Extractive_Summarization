by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity3 congressional hopeful @entity2 blows holes into a copy of the @entity6 with three different guns in a new campaign ad , saying he wants to ' see how much damage we can do to this copy of @entity6			1
' before resorting to a wood chipper decorated with a campaign sticker , the @entity13 candidate fires at the 1,000 - page health insurance law with a .40 caliber glock pistol , a .270 caliber @entity17 rifle and an @entity19			1
@entity51 @entity50 sen. @entity49 famously blew a hole in president @entity31 's favored ' cap and trade ' climate change bill in an ad that helped get him win a 2012 special election after the death of sen. @entity59			0
@entity49 's home state is the nation 's second - largest coal producer , trailing only @entity63			0
in @entity3 , @entity46 is trying to appeal to voters who prize the @entity28 and also dislike @entity6 by a massive margin			2
he 's running to replace the retiring rep. @entity68			1
in the ad , he builds a custom wooden box to serve as a target holder before shooting three guns at it			0
none of them is able to penetrate the entire thick stack of paper			2
' for those who have already been hurt by the law here in @entity3 , it 's anything but funny , ' says @entity46 of the increasingly controversial @entity6 scheme the final insult : all 1,000 - plus pages of the @entity6 go into a wood chipper ultimately , he resorts to using a wood chipper to shred it , while saying that ' we 'll have to resort to more extreme measures to get rid of @entity6 , and replace it with a market based solution			1
' in a statement after the ad appeared online , he said it ' shows that we can have fun with a serious subject , but for those who have already been hurt by the law here in @entity3 , it â€™s anything but funny			0
' in the june 3 primary that will likely serve as a proxy for the general election in a bright red state , @entity46 will face orthopedic surgeon @entity105 , @entity107 founder @entity106 and state rep. @entity108 .			0

@entity3 @entity13 distinguishes himself in a *crowded* primary field by firing three guns at the @entity6
each time , the *bullet* hole only penetrates part of the 1,000 - page stack of paper
so @entity2 , who wants to replace the retiring @entity13 rep. @entity68 , *tosses* the whole *printout* into a wood chipper
