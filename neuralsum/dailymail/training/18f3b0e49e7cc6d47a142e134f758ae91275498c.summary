they say power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely			0
but now it seems there could be a scientific reason why the trappings of success and elevated position can make people more likely to be dishonest , according to a new study			2
researchers found that expansive physical settings , such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work , or a large driver ’s seat in a car , can cause people to feel more powerful			2
this may , in turn , elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating , or even traffic offences , they claim			1
researchers found that expansive physical settings , such as having a big desk to stretch out while doing work , can cause people to feel more powerful the new research , published in the journal @entity29 , discovered that the physical environment may affect the likelihood of dishonesty			1
study leader doctor @entity33 , who spearheaded the research while at @entity35 in the @entity36			1
he said : ' in everyday working and living environments , our body postures are incidentally expanded and contracted by our surroundings - by the seats in our cars , the furniture in and around workspaces , even the hallways in our offices - and these environments directly influence the propensity of dishonest behaviour in our everyday lives			1
' trappings of success , such as having a big car , may , in turn , elicit more dishonest behaviour - such as stealing and cheating , or even traffic offences , researchers claim building on previous research demonstrating that expansive postures can lead to a state of power , and that power can lead to dishonest behaviour , the new study suggests that expanded , non-verbal postures forced on people by their environments could influence decisions and behaviours in ways that render people less honest			1
people who are considered unattractive are more likely to be belittled and bullied in the workplace , according to new research			0
the study by @entity74 found that unattractive workers were treated more harshly than their attractive colleagues when it came to promotions and which tasks they were given to do			2
and that being ' ugly ' played more of a role in how someone is treated than their age , gender or how long they had worked there			0
previous research has found that attractive students tend to be more popular in school			0
however , this study , led by associate professor of management at the @entity92 , is the first to find a direct correlation between attractiveness and bullying in the workplace			2
the research included findings from four studies conducted in the field and the laboratory			0
in one study , the researchers manipulated the expansiveness of workspaces in the lab and tested whether ' incidentally ' expanded bodies - shaped organically by one ’s environment - led to more dishonesty on a test			1
another experiment examined whether participants in a more expansive driver ’s seat would be more likely to ' hit and run ' when incentivised to go fast in a video game driving simulation			0
to extend results to a real - world context , a field study tested the ecological validity of the effect by examining whether car drivers ’ seat size predicted the violation of parking laws in @entity126			0
the field study revealed that cars with more expansive driver ’s seats were more likely to be illegally parked on @entity126 streets			0
dr @entity33 , who is now a visiting professor at @entity132 in the @entity36 , said the research indicates that while people may pay very little attention to ordinary and seemingly innocuous shifts in bodily posture , these subtle postural shifts can have tremendous impact on our thoughts , feelings and behaviour .			1
