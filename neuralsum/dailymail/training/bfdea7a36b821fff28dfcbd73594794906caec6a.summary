@entity0 may have thought he was harmlessly posting selfies to his friends back home , but last night the 24 - year - old @entity5 soldier was at the centre of international intrigue			1
for the photographs he has posted on the web appear to offer evidence that @entity12 ’s forces have been operating inside @entity13			1
geotagging – the process of adding a location to a photograph taken by a mobile phone camera – creates a trail that leads @entity0 , a sergeant in the signals corps , from a military base in southern @entity5 across the troublesome border to villages inside rebel - held parts of @entity13			1
the geotag trail starts on june 23 , with @entity0 pulling a face and raising two fingers while still on home soil , as @entity5 began building up its forces			1
one week later , he appeared from his @entity47 postings to be at @entity48 , a village in eastern @entity13 controlled by @entity51 separatists			2
on july 5 , @entity0 was seen rubbing his eye in a selfie on @entity47 that came with a caption saying ‘ time to sleep ’			2
the geotag – which is made by satellite based on a global positioning system – suggested the young @entity5 had moved to the @entity13 village of @entity59			1
the photo map , from @entity0 's @entity47 account , which appears to show two pictures , which were uploaded in @entity13 according to the @entity0 's @entity47 photo map , this picture was posted inside the @entity13 border the village , where this picture appears to have been uploaded is in rebel - held territory in the east of @entity13 on july 21 @entity0 , whose signals skills may have made him useful in training rebels , is seen tucking into a melon , apparently back in @entity5			1
five days ago , on july 27 , @entity0 posted another photo and wrote : ‘ sitting around , working on a buk , listening to music , basically a good sunday			2
’ @entity78 governments believe that a @entity5 - made @entity80 weapons system was supplied to rebel forces and that it mistakenly targeted the passenger plane while intending to shoot down a @entity13 military aircraft			1
another explanation may be that he used the word ‘ buk ’ as shorthand to mean a notebook computer			0
in this post , @entity0 says he is ' sitting around , working on a buk , listening to music			2
he signs off saying ' basically a good sunday ' the 24 - year - old who claims to be a @entity5 soldier describes himself as a communications specialist on social media international experts finally reached the @entity97 crash site yesterday – as up to 80 bodies still lay uncollected			1
after the @entity13 army and @entity51 rebels agreed to stop fighting for a ‘ day of quiet ’ , a small team of @entity101 and @entity102 specialists carried out a ‘ reconnaissance ’			2
‘ they can start searching as soon as possible during a later visit , ’ said a @entity101 spokesman			0
@entity102 foreign minister @entity109 said : ‘ it ’s heartbreaking			0
we have the experts ready to work and we ca n’t get to the site			0
’ there is no evidence that @entity0 – usually seen in armoured personnel carriers – is trained in @entity118 missiles nor that he had any role in downing @entity120			2
why @entity0 posted pictures on the web may be due to the boredom he had complained about in another post			0
‘ i still do n’t understand what we ’re doing here , so we ’re continuing to go slightly crazy , listen to @entity127 and wait for new news from @entity13 ! ’ even though a geotag is normally a clear indication of a person ’s whereabouts , some experts were advising an element of caution last night			0
sometimes a mobile phone can not link to the gps and instead uses roaming to identify the location			0
it is possible that @entity0 could have been in @entity5 but his phone , failing to link to the gps , at that moment had roamed on to a @entity13 network based across the border			1
it could also be that the data from the satellite became corrupted and wrongly identified the location			0
initially there was some speculation that the pictures might even be @entity13 propaganda			0
earlier this week , a senior communist in @entity34 , @entity153 , called for a crackdown on soldiers using social media sites , even though servicemen are already banned from using mobiles while serving in @entity5 army units			1
the location of @entity0 was not known last night			0
there was no official confirmation or denial that he is a soldier .			0

@entity0 , a @entity5 soldier , has been posting selfies on social media
several appear to show that they were uploaded from inside @entity13
he has been *swamped* with abuse from @entity5 for embarrassing them
