the news comes after the beleaguered show 's production team failed to secure the big - name artists previously featured in the highly - anticipated finals			2
so now it has been left to judges @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity4 , who will all take the stage this weekend at @entity35 to perform with the finalists			2
the pressure is on : @entity4 and her fellow judges will perform alongside their acts in this weekend 's live @entity8 final a show source said : ' once @entity44 's acts were eliminated it became clear the three judges with acts left were all current singers			1
' ' it 's going to be more pressured than ever			0
the acts will be singing in front of 10,000 people - and with their mentors , ' a source told the @entity53 ' the judges will be nervous as well because the song could be the difference between winning and losing			2
breaking new ground : @entity31 and @entity58 will perform the rousing number @entity60 , while @entity11 and @entity33 sing more than a woman ' and on top of that , @entity62 will be watching from @entity65			2
so the judges are almost auditioning for their places on next year 's show as well , ' the source added			0
according to the @entity53 , @entity0 agreed to perform on the final , but declined a duet with one of the acts			1

' during the 2005 @entity8 final , 13.9 % of votes cast by red button and text arrived too late to be included , although it did not affect the outcome of the show			1
