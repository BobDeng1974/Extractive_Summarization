@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 is unconcerned by the soft goals his side have conceded this season , suggesting it is down to attempts from manager @entity7 to develop their trademark attacking performances			1
@entity1 have conceded 19 goals in 15 matches in all competitions and are third in the @entity14 , already trailing leaders @entity16 by nine points			2
@entity7 's side will look to cut that deficit when they face @entity20 on sunday and @entity0 believes as long as @entity1 stick to the @entity24 's methods , they will have a successful campaign			1
@entity0 ( above ) said @entity1 's shaky defence is due to attempts to improve thier attacking displays city manager @entity7 ( above ) has seen his side concede 19 goals already so far this season " we 've leaked goals , simple goals have gone in and people have taken their chances against us , but with the way we play , we are quite open to conceding the odd goal or two , " @entity0 said in an interview with @entity32			1
" unfortunately , that is not great as a goalkeeper , but you 've got to be realistic and understand we are trying to build a way of playing football that potentially is going to lead to letting the odd goal in			0
" it is not something we accept , but as long as we carry on playing the way we 're playing under this philosophy that we 've got under the manager , we will be fine			0
" @entity0 also dismissed criticism aimed at defender @entity50 , a Â£ 32million summer arrival from @entity52			1
@entity0 defended @entity53 ( above ) , who has had a tough start to his @entity1 career since joining from @entity52 @entity53 ( left ) had a difficult match up against @entity58 ( right ) in the 2 - 0 loss against @entity60 @entity53 has endured a torrid beginning to his @entity1 career , epitomised in @entity1 's 2 - 0 defeat against @entity60 where he was relentlessly targeted by @entity58 and @entity66			2
but @entity0 believes the @entity68 international will prove to be an astute addition to the @entity14 champions			0
" @entity50 knows we are more than confident in him , the manager is more than confident in him , and that is the most important thing			0

@entity0 said @entity1 's attacking style leaves defence exposed
he feels @entity1 will improve if they stick with @entity7 's methods
