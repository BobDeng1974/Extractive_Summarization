@entity1 boss @entity0 believes his side will be more focused when they take on @entity3 for their @entity5 qualifier after a lacklustre 2 - 2 friendly draw against @entity7 on wednesday			1
@entity0 rested half a dozen key players , including @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 against @entity7 and the lack of quality on the pitch showed at times as the bold @entity17 champions narrowly missed out on a shock win			1
' this was a good test from which we can draw some conclusions , ' said @entity0 , who recently extended his contract to 2018			2
' but the team 's tension will increase ahead of the @entity3 game			0
we will be much more concentrated against them			0
' @entity0 is looking for a response from @entity1 following a poor performance against @entity7 @entity1 's @entity30 gives the @entity32 winners a 17th minute lead at the @entity34 @entity0 fielded an experimental three - man backline that not surprisingly failed to shine given @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , back after a two - and - a - half year absence , had never played together			1
' we never really had our defence under control , ' @entity0 admitted but said he would continue experimenting as he looks to make his team more flexible , with his players shifting positions more often			2
better news for @entity0 was the return of @entity38 and @entity48 , back for the first time since august 2013 , after their long injury absences			0
@entity1 's celebration is low key as they take the lead over @entity7 , the @entity57 champions @entity58 ( left ) pulled @entity7 level with a fine header during the 2 - 2 draw in @entity1 the @entity62 celebrate as the underdogs peg one back against the @entity32 champions ' you ca n't expect everything to work after such long absences			1
we did not apply things that we wanted to , ' said @entity0			0
' but we know that we need to win on sunday			0
' @entity72 's 81st minute equaliser was a further positive point for the head coach with the out - of - form winger again delivering for @entity1 with his 48th goal to climb to third on the all - time scorer list			2
' you can always count on @entity72 to inject life into a game , ' @entity0 said of the player , who has struggled for form at @entity83			2
@entity1 needed an 81st minute goal from @entity72 to earn a draw against the @entity7 @entity1 have been also been erratic in the qualifiers			1
they have managed seven points from four games , as many as @entity90 and @entity91 , with @entity92 three clear at the top of @entity94 with @entity1 in full force against @entity3 few will bet against the @entity32 winners leaving with three points to heave their qualification back on track			1
with @entity101 , @entity102 and the other players rested on wednesday ready to take over , @entity1 remain the favourites to win as they chase after top spot in the group			1
' it was certainly not the performance we were looking for against @entity7 , ' midfielder @entity107 said			0
' we are aware of how serious the situation is for the @entity113 qualifiers			0
but no one should be concerned			0
