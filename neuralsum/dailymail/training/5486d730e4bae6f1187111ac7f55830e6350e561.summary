@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 could use @entity4 small print to challenge @entity6 ’s right to play in the @entity8 next season			1
the rules now effectively set up a scenario where rivals can claim @entity6 have cheated their way to passing @entity4 ’s ‘ @entity13 ’ ( @entity13 ) test			1
it is understood lawyers for a host of ‘ major clubs ’ are aware of these potential rights to make appeals — thanks to recently amended @entity13 ( @entity23 ) regulations — and are monitoring the situation closely			1
he said : ‘ there are clubs that are following exactly the project of @entity13 and there are other clubs doing it in a dodgy way			2
for me , that is very clear			0
i do n’t say the clubs — that is not my job			0
’ when asked specifically about @entity6 , and a potential @entity4 investigation , he added : ‘ it ’s for mr @entity44 and other people to analyse it , it ’s not for me … i ’m waiting for that			2
’ financial force : @entity6 's spending power is among the greatest in football ' @entity13 ' ? @entity25 was critical , but he manages another expensive squad at @entity1 concern ? @entity6 manager @entity52 has a proven track record in the @entity8 @entity13 rules compel clubs to limit losses for the 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 seasons combined to £ 37million , with a ban from @entity60 competitions the severest theoretical punishment			1
city last week announced losses for 2012 - 13 of £ 51.6m , meaning they have lost £ 149.5m over two years			0
they can perhaps ‘ exempt ’ as much as £ 110m of those losses to meet @entity13 requirements			0
but they face accusations their losses are artificially low after earning cash from ‘ intellectual property ’ sales to related companies			0
@entity4 sources have confirmed this will be investigated to see if it is ‘ real ’ income			0
amended small print in the 2014 @entity4 @entity13 rulebook , just published , includes two key changes ; one allowing clubs to ‘ plea bargain ’ punishments for overspending , and another that allows other clubs to challenge those plea bargains if they feel the outcomes negatively affect them			1
time to celebrate ? @entity2 are one of the clubs not in a position to compete with @entity6 's financial muscle title rivals : @entity0 could be another team to benefit if @entity6 are to face a form of punishment money well spent : the signings of players like @entity97 have turned @entity6 into a real force			2

small print in @entity23 rule could affect @entity6 's *eligibility* for the @entity8
@entity25 accuses unnamed clubs of ' dodgy @entity13 '
' major clubs ' away of potential rights to appeal against those considered to have cheated their way to passing @entity13 test
