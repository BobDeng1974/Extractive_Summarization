@entity35 helps to protect teeth from decay and erosion , but becoming dehydrated from intense training can lead to a dry mouth , which increases the risk of oral health problems			1
the amount of energy that athletes need for training often means they have high - carbohydrate diets and regularly use sugary , acidic energy drinks which may also contribute to tooth decay and erosion			1
but simply flossing , knowing how to brush teeth properly , using fluoride toothpaste and mouthwash could provide the same marginal performance gains as expensive physical therapies , dentists advised			1
the news comes after a study by @entity61 researchers published last month , which found the longer athletes exercised , the less saliva they produced and the more alkaline it became			0

professor @entity118 of the @entity119 said : ' oral health could be an easy win for athletes , as the oral conditions that can affect performance are all easily preventable			1
' professional athletes and their teams spend a lot of time and money on ways to marginally improving performance , as this can make all the difference in elite sports			0
' simple strategies to prevent oral health problems can offer marginal performance gains that require little to no additional time or money			1
' things like better tooth brushing techniques and higher fluoride toothpastes could prevent the toothache and associated sleeping and training difficulties that can make the crucial difference between gold and silver			2
