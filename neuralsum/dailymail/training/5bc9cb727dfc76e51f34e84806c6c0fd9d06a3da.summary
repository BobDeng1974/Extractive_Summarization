by @entity0 published : 07:05 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:35 est , 3 december 2013 the supercar in which @entity4 died this week left professionals who tested it ' white ' with fear and has been branded ' the most dangerous car on the road ' by a former manufacturer			1
the 2005 @entity11 was being driven by the @entity14 star 's friend and business partner @entity12 when it crashed in @entity16 on tuesday , killing both of them			1
it has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about the souped - up model 's suitability for the road , due to its ultra light carbon - fibre frame and 5.7 litre race - derived v10 engine			1
too dangerous ? both professionals and engineers have voiced concern about the supercar 's suitability for the road it has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier @entity11 @entity34 models			1
@entity11 knew of the car 's sensitivity when they launched the model in 2004			1
according to @entity40 , a memo circulated to sales staff said of the @entity42 : ' this vehicle can not drive over a @entity44 can that is lying on its side			1
' ' you need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on ( dips ; pot holes , seam heights , etc. ) ' the @entity11 is as close to a racecar as we will ever get , this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar			1
in a chequered past , the @entity11 has been crashed by chat show legend @entity59 , who lost control while speeding around a circuit in 2005			2
another incident in 2005 saw two sportscar enthusiasts @entity64 and @entity66 killed in a racetrack smash in @entity68 after the @entity11 they were travelling in swerved into a concrete wall			2
in that case , @entity11 paid a portion of the $ 4.5million compensation fee awarded to the family of mr @entity66 after it was established there were ' handling problems ' with the vehicle			2
before its official release eight years ago , notable car experts gave excited but cautionary reviews of the @entity11 , in which the cars power and speed were repeatedly lauded alongside notes about how it was prone to steering off course			1
tragic : the aftermath of the car crash that killed @entity4 showed the vehicle to be out of control			0
the car has a history of unpredictability , according to reports in flames : the distinctive red finish of the @entity11 could be seen engulfed in flames , above speaking about testing the car at @entity97 's famous @entity96 , @entity98 , a former world rally champion and @entity11 test driver , told drive magazine : ' [ it was ] the first car in my life that i drive and i feel scared ... i came back into the pits and i was white			1
' that was echoed by renowned car critic @entity106 when he reviewed the @entity42 for hit @entity110 @entity109 motor show @entity107			0
' the dangerous part is that it requires immense skill to drive , and is tremendously unforgiving			0
' - @entity113 , former @entity11 worker during his test drive , the expert repeatedly lost control of the car on an empty race track			1
and , although being thrilled by its pace and power , he described the supercar 's engine as a ' landmine '			0
he said : ' i have never felt anything like that			0
' you need to be awake to drive this fast			0
it really is n't an easy car to control , the clutch is brutal , the power is savage , and the handling ... you really are on a knife edge			2
' other cars forgive you , but make a mistake in that and it bites your head off			0
' [ that ] v.10 engine is a landmine '			0
writing on car site @entity144 , @entity113 said : ' the most dangerous car on the road			0
' the dangerous part is that it requires immense skill to drive , and is tremendously unforgiving			0
' and it 's hard to understand the car 's limits because it 's unlike virtually any other car on the road , and it 'll respond in ways other cars wo n't			2
erratic : during a tv review first broadcast in @entity160 in 2004 , the @entity11 was seen to be prone to swerving out of control caution : when reviewing the car in 2004 , @entity110 tv presenter @entity106 said the car was unforgiving , saying ' you need to be awake to drive this fast ' although the car was the fastest to complete a lap of the show 's course @entity106 , described the motor 's engine as a ' landmine ' ' i personally think it 's the most dangerous car out there for this reason , and i know several people - including a couple of former owners - who agree			1
' the 2005 crash for which @entity11 accepted partial liability , bears a striking similarity to the accident which claimed the life of the @entity4 and @entity12			2
then , @entity11 owner @entity64 offered to give fellow car fan @entity66 a ride in his new sports car at the @entity188 track			1
after another driver in a @entity191 pulled out in front of the pair , they swerved to avoid a collision but careered straight into the track 's concrete wall			0
after mr @entity66 's wife took legal action alleging the wrongful death of her husband @entity11 agreed to pay eight per cent of a total $ 4.5 compensation fee			2
@entity202 : @entity203 @entity204 : @entity205 @entity206 : 205 mph @entity207 : 0 - 62 mph = 3.9s fuel consumption : 13.2 mpg drive type : @entity210 @entity211 : manual , 6 speed @entity213 weight : 3042 lbs or 1380 kg during the case it was established that the @entity11 was designed without electronic stability control , which @entity11 calls @entity217			1
@entity218 , a former racer and a successful plaintiffs ' attorney from @entity221 represented the @entity222			0
he alleged the lack of a @entity217 system was probably a marketing decision as the model was initially billed as a ' race car for the streets ' and track cars are generally made without a stabilising system to counter over-steer			0
speaking after the settlement , he told @entity233 that the @entity11 should be ' feared '			0
he said : ' most people , especially those with children on the streets and highways , would fear a vehicle like the @entity11 , with its tricky handling characteristics , 600 - plus horsepower , and unskilled , unqualified drivers			0
' when a ' race car for the streets ' is sold to anyone with enough money , regardless of his ability to drive it , and it does n't even incorporate modern electronic safety devices that correct driver errors , then maybe the manufacturer should accept some responsibility for the foreseeable deaths that will result			1
' @entity251 have contacted @entity11 but a spokesperson refused to comment			0
the car has been involved in other high profile crashes , but the death of @entity4 will bring fresh questions about its safety			1
