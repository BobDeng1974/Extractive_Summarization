a landmark court victory against @entity1 over unfair overdraft charges could open the floodgates for a billion - pound payout to customers			1
a judge at @entity7 ruled that the bank was wrong to hit @entity10 ’s bank account with hefty rising fees that drove him ever deeper into debt			1
penalties totalling more than £ 700 made it impossible for the 28 - year - old public health sector worker to pay other bills – and triggered a spiral of debt that paralysed his finances			1
@entity10 and his wife @entity20 won a significant victory against @entity1 over rising fees only after the loyal @entity1 customer hired a debt management company did the bank stop imposing charges of up to £ 20 a day			1
in his ruling , deputy district judge @entity27 said the bank ’s terms and conditions caused a ‘ significant imbalance … to the detriment ’ of mr @entity10			1
he ordered the bank to reimburse £ 743 in charges plus interest			1
it was the first known legal victory for a customer on the fairness of charges since banks won a hearing over the legality of the fees in the @entity44 five years ago			1
that ruling , on a technicality , dashed the hopes of millions trying to claim fee refunds			0
in the run - up to the 2009 case , bank customers , led by @entity53 ’s @entity52 on @entity55 campaign , reclaimed millions of pounds			1
but the @entity44 decision meant customers could no longer challenge their bank			0
outraged at how severely the penalties pushed him into debt , mr @entity10 learned of a recent @entity62 ruling			1
this says that any charges increased within an agreement must be clearly explained , including an explanation of how they were worked out			0
with help from solicitor @entity69 , mr @entity10 showed how individual clauses within @entity1 ’ terms and conditions failed to do this			1
the judge at @entity7 in @entity75 agreed			1
but , critically , judge @entity76 said the judgment applied only to the claimant			1
@entity1 imposed rising charges of £ 20 a day on mr @entity10 which was later overturned mr @entity10 appealed against this part of the ruling			1
last week , he went back to court to ask it to rule that the @entity1 clauses relating to account charges are themselves unfair – not just in relation to his case			1
if the court agrees , it would apply to all bank customers , leaving banks open to huge payouts			2
mr @entity10 , 28 , from @entity7 , said : ‘ it is unfair the banking industry is allowed to profit while people suffer financial hardship			0
by applying these charges , and allowing them to snowball out of control , it skews the imbalance			0
‘ we want the court to consider that such a system of charges can hit anyone badly – not just those in hardship – and is therefore unfair , and needs to be changed			2
’ a ruling is not expected until later this year			0
until then , the county court ruling is not a legal precedent			2
however , judges can use it for guidance			0
@entity114 , founder of the @entity115 , hailed the judgment as a boost for consumers			0
‘ these extortionate charges are hugely unfair and it is absurd that the present law merely says courts must turn a blind eye to this issue , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s about time bank customers got the fair treatment that they are entitled to by law			0
’ @entity130 , founder of the @entity132 website , called mr @entity10 a pioneer			0
‘ it ’s up to the court to decide if such a term can be unfair to all – regardless of whether they ’re struggling in financial hardship , ’ he said			2
‘ potentially , we ’re talking billions of pound			0
’ @entity53 first sounded the alarm on charges in 2005 when some banks began to raise fees for unauthorised overdrafts			2
the @entity52 on @entity55 campaign created a template letter for customers to help them reclaim the penalty fees			2
by july 2007 , more than £ 800million had been paid out by banks and the @entity151 stepped in to try to resolve the situation for all customers			2
although it scored early victories , the @entity44 eventually ruled that the fees were part of a bank ’s ‘ core costs ’ of providing a current account – and , on a technicality , could n’t be assessed under rules on fairness			0
a spokesman for @entity164 said : ‘ we do not discuss individual customer cases and any decision will be specific to its facts			0
however , the legal issues relating to bank charges were dealt with comprehensively and conclusively by the judgment of the @entity44			0

@entity174 was charged fees and penalties of more than £ 700
@entity1 *continued* adding £ 20 - a - day on the debt *crippling* his finances
a judge ordered @entity1 to refund the money after a court hearing
