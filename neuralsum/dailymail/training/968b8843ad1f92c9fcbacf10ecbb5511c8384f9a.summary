the story of @entity2 ’s naked ride through the streets of @entity4 has been a cornerstone of @entity7 folklore for 1,000 years			1
but now a @entity9 chocolate manufacturer has sparked outrage by claiming it has exclusive rights to both her name and the famous image of her on top of a horse			1
the situation was exposed when lawyers acting for the confectionery giant fired a warning letter to a pub called @entity23 last week , warning that it was infringing on its ‘ intellectual property ’			1
owner @entity26 was given a 90 - day ultimatum to change his bar ’s name and remove all references to the 11th century noblewoman , whose daring protest at oppressive taxes has become the stuff of legend			1
@entity53 , vice-chairman of the @entity54 , said : ‘ this is an absolute travesty			0
no one should be allowed to hijack the identity of historical figures for their own commercial interests			0
‘ when i was in @entity9 recently i thought it was a bit of a cheek that they were selling chocolates with @entity2 on the box , but i never thought it would come to this			1
‘ if the @entity9 try to enforce this in @entity4 , there will be angry protests			1
we are very proud of @entity2 , and she is known and loved around the world			2
’ the @entity73 has discovered that @entity74 successfully filed a patent on @entity2 ’s identity in 2007			2
it appears on the register of the @entity79 in @entity80 , the official body for trademark applications , alongside several versions of the woman - on - a - horse image			2
legal experts said it would have been relatively easy for the company to stake its claim for a fee of about £ 1,000			0
it would have no obligation to consult interested parties before going ahead			0
the @entity95 in @entity96 - where owner @entity26 is having a dispute about the name of the pub with @entity100 based in @entity9 @entity53 , vice-chairman of the @entity54 , said : ‘ this is an absolute travesty			1
no one should be allowed to hijack the identity of historical figures for their own commercial interests mr @entity26 , who set up his @entity7 - themed pub in @entity96 seven years ago , was warned that its name might cause ‘ confusion ’ with the confectioner			1
but he said : ‘ my pub has nothing to do with chocolates so i do n’t see how anyone could be confused			0
’ the 55 - year - old , who was born in @entity7 but moved to @entity116 for family reasons , said he would fight the legal threat in a @entity121 - and - @entity120 battle			0
‘ i wanted to name the pub after a woman who was part of @entity126 ’s heritage and i could think of no one better or more famous than @entity2 , ’ he added			2
‘ as well as the sign outside , we ’ve got her name engraved on the windows and front door			0
it would cost a fortune to remove them			0
my regulars are absolutely furious			0
i am not going to back down			0
this has been the @entity2 pub for seven years and that ’s how it ’s going to stay			1
’ @entity2 was the wife of @entity142 , @entity143 , and the story goes that she went naked to protest against her husband ’s taxes on his tenants			2
the term @entity2 originates from a tailor who was reputedly struck blind after ignoring a decree that no townsfolk should watch her feat. the @entity9 brand is actually owned by @entity155 ’s @entity154 , which paid more than £ 500 million for the company in 2007			1
managers at its @entity159 headquarters refused to disclose how many other @entity2 - named businesses had been sent warning letters			1
managers at its @entity159 headquarters refused to disclose how many other @entity2 - named businesses had been sent warning letters in a statement last night , marketing director @entity165 said : ‘ @entity2 is one of the world ’s most well - known brands with a unique reputation , heritage and name			1
in addition to our chocolates and the shops that sell them , we also have a growing line of @entity2 cafes			2
clearly , it is important for us to ensure that consumers are not confused by a place serving food and drink using the @entity2 name and imagery when that place has nothing to do with us			2
’ but this explanation cut no ice with @entity192 , who has taken the role of @entity2 in annual processions commemorating @entity4 ’s most celebrated daughter			1
‘ the @entity197 family , who founded the @entity2 company , came over here to see the parade years ago and fell in love with @entity2 , ’ she said			0
‘ they sell their chocolates with a leaflet in the box which is supposed to tell the story but it ’s full of mistakes			0
it ’s so sad to hear they are trying to keep the name to themselves			0
it does n’t leave a sweet taste in the mouth , does it ? ’			0
