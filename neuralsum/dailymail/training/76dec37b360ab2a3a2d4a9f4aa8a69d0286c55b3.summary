by @entity1 reporter published : 20:59 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 19 february 2013 a police force has produced a bizarre jargon - filled ‘ mission statement ’ – that does n’t even mention crime			1
it is so filled with gobbledegook that it has been branded ‘ absolute rubbish ’ and short - listed for an award highlighting nonsense in official paperwork			1
the internal document from @entity14 says it aims to ‘ protect people from harm ’ with a range of ‘ outcome focused ’ functions that ‘ are professionally competent and understand the operational policing context of their services , ensuring that they are quality assured , effective and efficient ’			1
solving something : the 1,200 word document from @entity14 does not mention the word crime once the @entity30 , a four - page management mission statement for @entity32 , it and communications , speaks of police chiefs vowing to be ‘ accountable through performance measurement ’			1
in 1,200 words , the word crime does not appear			1
the document is a contender for the @entity39 , run by the @entity40			2
spokesman @entity41 said : ‘ it ’s absolute rubbish as far as i am concerned			2
it ’s a screen to hide behind			2
it just makes me think " what are they up to ? " ’ ‘ how can i make informed decisions if they do not talk to me in plain @entity50 ? @entity51 gives me no choice			0
most of us do not use words like that			1
‘ i ’m not asking for ‘ the cat sat on the mat ’ but all familiar words seem to have been sieved out and all you are left with is a horrible mess			1
i ca n’t understand any of it			0
' bureaucratic tape : the four page internal memo has been nominated for an award highlighting paperwork nonsense ‘ after 50 years it ’s the worst i have ever seen it.they seem to want to cloud negative messages in jargon			1
‘ it ’s a screen to hide behind			0
it just makes me think ‘ what are they up to ? what are they trying to cover up ? ’ ’ a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ we always welcome feedback on our communications			1
‘ this document was prepared for an internal audience			0
‘ the role of the new directorate was discussed in team meetings and this summary document was used as a basis for that discussion			0
‘ no one said they did not understand the directorate ’s role in protecting people from harm after these meetings			0
’ ironically , the force has even drawn up its own jargon - busting list of do ’s and don’ts for officers			2
the list advises officers not to refer to the colour black in case it offends someone			0
the report states : ‘ do n’t use phrases that include @entity108 in a negative context , such as ‘ black mark ’ ‘ black day ’			0
officers are also told not to use the words @entity113 but say someone is either @entity115 or of ‘ dual parentage			2
’ bobbies are also warned against using colloquialisms or ‘ terms of endearment that may cause offence such as ' my love ' or ' my dear ’			0
elsewhere @entity123 wants to save paper , or as they put it : ‘ reduce the consumption of raw materials in line with the organisation ’s value for money and environmental strategies			0
