by @entity0 millions of @entity3 insects developed by @entity5 scientists could be released into food crop fields without proper safety checks , it is claimed			1
the @entity5 company @entity8 is working on genetically modified insects that are designed to kill off pests that feed on crops such as cabbages , broccoli , tomatoes and fruit			1
the firm insists the technology is a green alternative to the use of chemical sprays , which have their own dangers for human health and the countryside			1
the @entity24 could be the first first insect to be genetically modified then released into the wild in @entity5 @entity8 has already developed a number of @entity3 insects , including moths and mosquitoes			1
its technology involves inserting a lethal gene into male insects which are then released in large numbers to mate with their wild female counterparts			2
this gene is passed on to any resulting offspring , such as caterpillars , which die quickly before attacking vegetable crops , so boosting farm yields and profits			0
it accused critics of scaremongering and said there is zero chance of its insects being used on farms without thorough checks on all aspects of their safety			0
however , a new report from @entity3 critics and public interest groups argues food watchdogs in @entity5 , @entity55 and beyond are failing to put in place a thorough testing and safety regime			1
they warn , for example , that the larvae of these @entity3 insects could get in to human food on vegetables and fruit without any checks on the risk to health			1

the firm has had talks with the food and farming department @entity79 and @entity5 ’s @entity81 ( @entity81 ) about trials with @entity3 diamondback moths , which are designed to kill off pests that feed on cabbages			1
the company has already run trials in the @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 where millions of its @entity3 mosquitoes have been released in an effort to reduce the wild population which is responsible for spreading @entity94 fever to humans			2
the coalition of public interest groups challenging the effectiveness of the safety regime includes @entity100 @entity5 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104			2
the group complained : ‘ plans to commercialise @entity3 insects would result in many millions of @entity3 insects being released in fields of crops , including olives , tomatoes , citrus fruits , cabbages and cotton			1
' in future , any insect species might be genetically modified			2
’ they claim that @entity8 has lobbied to ensure that experts who support the use of @entity3 insects have been appointed to key committees set up by the @entity122 ( @entity122 )			1
up close : the diamondback moth 's eye			0
researchers hope to genetically modify it to kill wild moths which attack crops these committees are responsible for designing the policing regime for the controversial technology			1
as a result , they fear that the system will not be sufficiently rigorous to protect public health and the environment			0
dr @entity137 , the director of @entity100 @entity5 said : ‘ the public will be shocked to learn that @entity3 insects can be released into the environment without any proper oversight			1
' conflicts - of - interest should be removed from all decision - making processes to ensure the public have a proper say about these plans			0
’ @entity146 ( correct ) , executive director , @entity147 , said : ‘ risk assessment of genetically engineered animals touches many areas where there is lack of knowledge			0
' we are concerned that @entity122 will apply a biased and selective protocol to safety without really sorting out potential hazards			0
’ @entity158 , @entity102 , said : ‘ the development of gm - insects for agriculture implies unforeseeable risks for human health and environment			1
in order to meet the challenges of small scale agriculture in poor countries , we do not need expensive and high risk technologies , but agro-ecological solutions			0
’ @entity8 chief executive , @entity171 , accused the groups of scaremongering			0
‘ to assert that a small company of our size can bias and subvert regulatory processes around the world in some kind of machiavellian way is pure conspiracy theory nonsense , ’ he said			0
‘ we are a company with a high scientific reputation and we hope people will see what we are doing in terms of the protection of human health			1
there are also huge environmental benefits in terms of the reduction of pesticide use			0
’ the researchers have also created @entity195 he said @entity8 ’s safety testing is very similar to the controlled clinical trials used to test and approve new medicines			0
‘ it is complete nonsense to suggest that @entity3 insects could be released without a proper safety assessment , ’ he said			2
‘ decisions on whether , when and how to introduce new technological advances - of whatever type - should go through the proper channels and regulatory systems			0
each product should be judged on its merits and the benefits and risks assessed			0
’ @entity79 insists it has made no decisions on whether to allow @entity3 insect field trials and that it will be guided by experts who sit on @entity216 , the @entity217 on @entity218			2
however , the department has a record of supporting biotechnology and is lobbying in the @entity222 for a speeding up of the approval system for @entity3 crops .			2
