@entity1 's summer move from @entity2 to @entity3 looks set to be the most costly deal in 2014			1
the @entity6 giants may have only had to pay a figure of around £ 75million for the @entity8 but when taking into account the range of additional fees during his five - year contract , @entity1 's move could potentially cost @entity3 up to £ 199m			1
this far from princely sum eclipses the 2013 calculated total for @entity18 's move to @entity19 , which looks likely to cost the @entity21 leaders around £ 158m during the @entity23 's stay in @entity24			0
@entity1 's move from @entity2 to @entity3 looks set to be the most costly deal in 2014 @entity1 in action for @entity3 during his club 's 3 - 1 @entity28 win against @entity30 the 27 - year - old 's five - year deal could cost @entity3 close to £ 199million @entity1 to @entity3 - £ 199m @entity33 to @entity34 - £ 190.4m @entity35 to @entity19 - £ 133.5m @entity36 to @entity37 - £ 113m @entity38 to @entity34 - £ 103.5m @entity39 to @entity40 - £ 102.7m @entity41 to @entity40 - £ 100.3m @entity42 to @entity34 - £ 96.4m @entity43 to @entity30 - £ 90.9m @entity44 to @entity45 - £ 87.7m although @entity3 stand to spend the most on a single player , the @entity47 , calculates that @entity34 's busy transfer windows in 2014 will eventually see the @entity50 club having to part with close to £ 400m on the likes of @entity33 , @entity38 and @entity42			1
elsewhere , @entity33 's £ 60m move to @entity34 sees the @entity54 in second place in 2014 's most costly transfers , potentially commanding a figure of £ 190.4m once considering details such as original fee , tax , salary and length of contract			2
@entity64 , who has been accused of being reluctant to splash @entity37 's cash in recent years , will see his club fork out around £ 133m during @entity36 's time at the @entity68			0
@entity69 faithful will argue , however , that the diminutive @entity71 has been worth every penny of his £ 35m fee after nine goals in 16 @entity76 games so far this season			0
@entity33 's £ 60m move to @entity34 is second on the 2014 most costly transfers list @entity34 stand to spend close to £ 400m after big money deals for the likes of @entity42 ( left ) and @entity38 @entity36 has already scored nine @entity76 goals , but his deal could cost @entity37 £ 113m the top 10 list , compiled by goal , also includes four @entity40 deals with their @entity39 and @entity41 moves eventually costing the @entity87 over £ 200m while the £ 50m summer sale of @entity43 could cost @entity30 up to £ 90.9m with @entity42 's january move eventually taking around £ 96.4m from @entity34 's pocket			1
the 2014 list also shows the increase in club spending across @entity94 , with the combined cost rising by 27 per cent compared to last year 's compilation			0
interestingly , nine of the top 10 deals in 2014 include at least one @entity76 club while not a single club from @entity101 or the @entity103 feature in the big money moves			0
@entity35 's move from @entity106 to @entity19 is the only transfer to feature on the top 10 list which did n't involve a @entity76 club @entity39 came to @entity40 for £ 32m , but could cost the club close to £ 102.7m during his time in @entity113			2

@entity1 's summer move could cost @entity3 close to £ *200million*
