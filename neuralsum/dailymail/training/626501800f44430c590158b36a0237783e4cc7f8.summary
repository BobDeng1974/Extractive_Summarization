@entity9 , 28 , and her relative , @entity11 , 33 , were said by police to have been responsible for burning to death young mother @entity13 in the central highlands of @entity15 earlier this month			1
the shocking death of @entity17 , whom villagers believed had used sorcery to kill the six - year - old son of @entity21 , made international headlines and prompted a widespread manhunt through the jungles of central @entity15			1
repeat horror : the attack took place in the same town where a young mother was burned alive accused for killing a child through sorcery ( pictured ) in dawn raids on a number of villages , more than 100 people were detained and questioned about the fiery murder – and all were released except the two who have now been charged			1
provincial police commander superintendent @entity39 told @entity41 newspaper that the pair were charged after ‘ intensive questioning ’ of all those rounded up in the raids			1
scores of people had gathered at a rubbish tip when miss @entity13 was dragged there , ordered to strip , doused with petrol and set alight			1
burning tyres were thrown onto her body as she screamed in pain but police , who had rushed to the area after hearing reports that a ‘ witch ’ was to be burned were forced back by the jeering crowd			2
miss @entity13 was accused by close relatives of the dead boy of using sorcery to bring about his death			1
he had complained of severe stomach pain and died later in hospital			0
villagers claimed that miss @entity13 had confessed under torture of using sorcery against the boy , but there was no evidence of this			1
still alive : sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in @entity15 's highlands superintendent @entity39 said that hours after @entity77 and her brother - in - law were arrested , police charged a villager with the torture of two elderly women who were accused by locals of practising sorcery			1
the women , who had been tied to posts , were rescued by police shortly before they , too , were about to be burned alive			0
‘ we are not finished from here , ’ said the superintendent			0
‘ we are continuing investigations into these cases and if any evidence or reports come in later saying that other people involved are still at large , we will also arrest them			0
’ the young mother was tossed screaming on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive after being accused of killing a neighbour 's six - year - old son with sorcery			1
@entity13 , 20 , was said to have ' confessed ' after she was dragged from her hut , stripped naked and tortured with white - hot iron rods			1
she was then dragged to a local rubbish dump , doused in petrol and , with hands and feet bound , thrown on a fire of burning tyres			2
as the mother - of - two screamed in agony , more petrol - soaked tyres were thrown on top of her			2
the tragedy unfolded after miss @entity13 's young neighbour fell sick earlier this month			1
he complained of pains in the stomach and chest and was taken to @entity116 hospital where he died a few hours later			0
scene : the two women had been tied to poles and were about to be burned alive when police arrived in @entity116 relatives of the boy were suspicious that witchcraft was involved in the death and learned that two women had gone into hiding in the jungle			1
after they were tracked down , the pair admitted they practised sorcery but had nothing to do with the boy 's death			1
miss @entity134 , they said , was the person responsible			0
the boy 's family went to her hut at 7am on wednesday , stripped her and dragged her away to torture and death			1
pictures of the horrific scene were soon circulating online			0
the @entity143 newspaper said the torture and brutal murder of a mother of two ‘ provided a photo opportunity for many of the onlookers , including school children , who crowded around and took photos of the woman being consumed alive by the fire			2
’ police who rushed to the area were turned back by the angry crowd , but were able to drive away with one of the other women while the second has fled			0
part of the culture : sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in @entity15 , which brought in a @entity165 to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic ( file picture ) breaking the law : the criminalisation of sorcery has seen several cases of violent vigilante action against ' witches ' and ' sorcerers ' in highland villages sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in @entity15 and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation			1
the cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 new @entity15 kina ( £ 303 ) , plus a pig and a bag of rice , in 1971 , whilst still a colony , the country introduced a @entity165 to criminalise the practice			1
however the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic , such as that on @entity17 , and convictions by ‘ kangaroo courts ’ made up of of local village elders			0
as a result the @entity15 law reform commission proposing to repeal the law			2
last july , 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals			2
in 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘ kangaroo court ’ convicted him of sorcery			0
a firetruck which had been called to the scene was chased away by the crowd			0
authorities and international diplomats have spoken out against the torching of the young mother , leaves behind two children , the youngest an eight - month - old girl			0
the country 's prime minister @entity227 had promised to bring the killers to justice			0
‘ no one commits such a despicable act in the society that all of us , including @entity13 , belong to , ' he said			2
‘ barbaric killings connected with alleged sorcery			0
violence against women because of this belief that sorcery kills			0
these are becoming all too common in certain parts of the country			0
' it is reprehensible that women , the old and the weak in our society should be targeted for alleged sorcery or wrongs that they actually have nothing to do with			0
’ the @entity251 embassy on the @entity15 issued a statement condemning the " ’ brutal murder ’ calling it evidence of ‘ pervasive gender - based violence ’			1
’ we add our voice to those of @entity15 religious and civil society leaders who have spoken out against the brutality inflicted upon ms @entity134 , ’ the embassy said			2
‘ there is no possible justification for this sort of violence			0
we hope that appropriate resources are devoted to identifying , prosecuting , and punishing those responsible for ms @entity134 's murder			2
