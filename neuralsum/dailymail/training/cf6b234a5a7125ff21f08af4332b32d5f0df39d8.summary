skin taken from the dead could soon be used to treat wounds in the living			1
researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers that is stripped of its cells is effective in healing acute wounds , such as burns , as well as painful ulcers			1
they believe the new treatment could be used to treat wounds that do not easily heal by themselves , which cost the @entity15 alone more than $ 25 billion ( £ 17 billion ) a year			2
researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers ( a stock image is pictured ) that is stripped of cells , is effective in healing burns as well as painful ulcers for decades , scientists have developed increasingly effective skin substitutes to help treat wounds , which aim to mimic the body ’s extracellular matrix – the scaffolding of proteins and compounds that bind cells together , @entity19 reported			1
they are now focusing on using real skin			2
a team of researchers led by @entity32 , a bioengineer at the @entity34 , used human skin from cadavers , which they decontaminated with antibiotics			1
they then used a combination of detergents , enzymes and other chemicals to remove cells from the skin , so that the recipient ’s immune system is less likely to react and cause a person ’s body to reject the organ			1
the experts stripped out the skin ’s inner layer – the dermis – which contains blood vessels , nerve endings , hair follicles and sweat glands , to leave behind its matrix of proteins			0
scientists have already developed skin substitutes ( stock image shown left ) to help treat wounds , which aim to mimic the body ’s extracellular matrix – the scaffolding of proteins and compounds that bind cells together			1
now they have shown that cadaver skin can be used to treat acute wounds as well as ulcers ( illustrated right ) artificial skin which could replace animals in drug and cosmetics testing was grown in a laboratory for the first time in april 2014			1
scientists in the @entity81 and @entity15 were able to produce one centimetre - wide fragments of epidermis - the outermost skin layer - from stem cells with the same properties as real skin			1
scientists believe that in the future , lab - grown skin could be used for testing medicinal lotions and creams or cosmetics without causing suffering to animals			0
it could also provide a model for investigating skin conditions such as eczema			0
dr @entity98 , who led the @entity81 team from @entity100 , said : ' our new method can be used to grow much greater quantities of lab - grown human epidermal equivalents , and thus could be scaled up for commercial testing of drugs and cosmetics			0
' human epidermal equivalents representing different types of skin could also be grown , depending on the source of the stem cells used , and could thus be tailored to study a range of skin conditions and sensitivities in different populations			1
' dr @entity116 likened this to an empty shell of a house without furniture that is easier to populate then building a house from scratch			0
‘ in the same way , decellularised dermis provides a scaffold that the body can try to populate with its own cells			1
’ the team discovered that ‘ decellulised ’ skin can be used to treat acute wounds , such as burns			1
they removed four disks of skin , each measuring 0.2 inches ( five millimetres ) from 50 healthy volunteers , according to the study published in the journal @entity139			0
one of the wounds was left to heal naturally , another had the disk of removed skin , re-attached , the third was treated with a man - made skin substitute and the fourth , was decellulised skin from a cadaver			2
they found that the skin from the cadaver was the best at triggering growth of new blood vessels and was a strong as the volunteer ’s own skin			2
it could also rebuild scar tissue			0
the advantage of using it over artificial skin is that the body is familiar with its structure			2
dr @entity116 plans on testing the ‘ decelluarised ’ skin on more patients as well as adding electrical stimulation to see if this accelerates the healing process			0
the team has previously proved that skin from cadavers can be used to treat chronic wounds that have not healed in six to eight weeks , or in some cases , years			1
dr @entity116 said that he had a patient who was 92 years old who had suffered with a skin ulcer for 20 years			0
‘ after we treated her with decellularised dermis , she healed within four weeks , ’ he said			0
the number of people with ulcers is expected to rise in line with ageing populations			0
this is because conditions linked to skin wounds , such as diabetes and obesity become more common			2
the experts stripped out the skin ’s inner layer – the demis , shown in this diagram – which contains blood vessels , nerve endings , hair follicles and sweat glands , to leave behind its extracellular matrix			0

@entity34 researchers found that skin taken from cadavers can acute wounds , such as burns , as well as painful ulcers
they decontaminated the skin with antibiotics , before using detergents , enzymes and other chemicals to remove cells from the skin
' @entity216 ' skin is less likely to be rejected by a person *'s* body
