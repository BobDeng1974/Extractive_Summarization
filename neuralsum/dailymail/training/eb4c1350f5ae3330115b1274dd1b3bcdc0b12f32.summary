millions of viewers were left stunned last night as @entity1 was killed in a car crash moments after seeing his newborn son in @entity5 ’s @entity4 special			1
the much - loved character , played by @entity7 , died after swerving off the road to avoid another vehicle			1
the fatal twist was so unforeseen that it took the breath away			1
in @entity5 , after two hours of premonitions that @entity16 ’s oldest daughter , @entity15 , would suffer the fate of her sister @entity18 and die in childbirth , an entirely different tragedy occurred			1
it happened off - screen : an open - topped roadster on a country lane , a looming lorry , and then a cut to @entity26 in the @entity5 drawing room , reflecting that ‘ we do n’t always get our just deserts ’			1
that was , for her , an uncharacteristic understatement			1
@entity15 ’s husband , cousin @entity33 , was bowling home from the maternity hospital , where he had just kissed hello to his baby son , born a few weeks premature			1
unforeseen : @entity1 ( @entity7 ) and his wife @entity15 ( @entity39 ) and their baby			1
@entity33 had just left the maternity hospital when he was killed in a car crash he told his wife that he felt as if he ’d swallowed a box of fireworks			1
she told him to remember the feeling , so that he ’d forgive her more easily next time she did something silly ... like crashing his precious car			1
@entity5 has never been @entity33 ’s story : it ’s a family saga			1
and yet he has been the pivot , the axle for the free - wheeling plot			2
he was the war hero , the lover who was paralysed , the heir who could not father children , the saviour who saved the estate from bankruptcy			2
to see him , dead on the roadside , a thick bead of blood drooling from his ear , was a shock			2
this was the coup de grace in a @entity4 season ’s viewing that left no heartstring unwrung			2
not only were @entity70 and @entity71 both dead in the final episode of @entity73 , but the doctor ’s new companion suffered a fatal plunge from a cloud , just moments after she was given the key to the @entity80 in @entity81			1
but @entity33 ’s death was the climax , a jaw - dropper in the final seconds of a two - hour @entity5 special			1
the rest of the episode was a bizarre summer holiday in @entity89 for the aristocracy , and a day at the village fair for the below - stairs cast			2
seconds from tragedy : in a shocking twist , @entity33 is killed when he crashes his roadster on the way home from the hospital the @entity99 were off to a cousin at @entity101 in the @entity102 , for a spot of stalking			1
in the @entity106 , that meant shooting wildlife with antlers , not lurking on footpaths for a glimpse of someone you fancy ( although @entity114 the footman did a spot of that , and got a beating from the local roughs as a result )			2
the @entity102 excursion meant magnificent @entity89 scenery , but the effect was much the same as one of @entity125 ’s periodic mass outings to @entity126			2
storylines in the open air seemed melodramatic instead of intense			2
the vast glens and mountainsides could not compensate			2
as @entity133 remarked wearily : ‘ that is the thing about nature , there ’s so much of it			0
’ @entity136 ! @entity33 is killed in a car accident after rushing home to @entity5 to tell the family about his newborn son accident : after colliding with @entity33 's car , the driver and passenger of the van rush to his aid and then there was the question of what to wear in the evening			1
‘ i ’m taking a diamond tiara , ’ one character murmured			0
‘ might not need it , but i ’d rather be safe than sorry			0
’ to underline the ancestry of the series , and its direct descent from the @entity157 classic @entity158 , @entity159 appeared			0
she played a foul - tempered , nagging niece , but she has n’t changed so much since she was @entity163 ’s idealistic , @entity162 little sister			0
the only @entity165 theme was the impending birth , a theme that call the midwife was able to play with clever and moving ways			0
from the first moment , when a nurse ’s hands were washing a tiny wooden baby from the nativity scene , there were echoes and parallels with the @entity179 story			0
another loss for the family : @entity33 's death paves the way for actor @entity7 ' exit unaware : while @entity33 is dying , his wife @entity15 is cuddling their son in hospital a child was born , not in a stable but in the communal toilet of a block of flats			1
another baby was left in a cardboard box on the convent steps , and the episode hinged on the need to find the unmarried mother			0
in a poignant sub-plot , an old woman who had spent half her life in the workhouse was taken to find the graves of her children			0
the cause of death for all of them had been , in the evasive officialese of the day , ‘ failure to thrive ’ – in other words , malnourishment			0
for all its nostalgia , call the midwife is clear - eyed about the bad old days			0
but it is gleeful about an era before health and safety , too			0
as the caretaker struggled to get the christmas tree lights working , he called out to a grubby - kneed boy , ‘ go on sonny , go and wiggle that plug for me			0
’ the lights duly blew up			0
best line of the night went to the irritable nun who was about to set out on her @entity230 rounds to give insulin injections to diabetics			0
‘ they ’ll all have been at the @entity234 , every man - jack of them , ’ she grumbled			0
‘ if i was the prime minister , i ’d shut that factory down			0

fatal twist was so unforeseen that it took the breath away
