learning to ride a bike is an important childhood milestone , but it can be expensive to upgrade models as children grow up			1
but now an engineer has created a bike that ’s designed to grow with a child			0
the ‘ @entity11 ’ is extendable so it can fit children for a full five years , during which time they would usually outgrow three bicycles			1
the first balance bike phase is shown left and the final pedal bike , right aimed specifically at children from the age of two to seven , the bicycle has three different adjustable sizes , so it grows longer and taller when needed			1
parents can adjust the height of the handlebars , saddle and frame to suit their child and its inventor claims there is no need for stabilisers			0
the bike starts its evolution as a pedal-less balance bike , its creator says is ideal for little ones learning to ride			1

here , children between the ages of two and seven show the different phases of the bike , with the oldest child riding a pedal bike instead of balance bikes ( shown in red and pink ) phase one : the bike starts its evolution as a pedal-less balance bike ( pictured ) that its creator says is ideal for little ones learning to ride mr @entity60 was working in a bike shop when he got the inspiration for the bicycle			1
‘ i was working as a mechanic and sales person and it was there that i came across balance bikes and saw how quickly kids were comfortable on them			0
‘ often small kids would just jump onto one and start zooming around the shop , it just seemed so natural for them			0
‘ unfortunately though , normal balance bikes are very small and kids quickly grow out of them			0
‘ on top of that , when a child is ready to begin using a pedal bike , the parents needed to come back and buy a new bike			2
‘ being an engineer , my creative mind began churning out ideas and many iterations , prototypes and pondering sleepless nights later , the @entity11 was born			2
’ by moving and reattaching the rear frame , it can be turned into a larger balance bike with a taller seat and handlebars			1
as the child becomes bigger , parents can increase the bike to its largest size - equivalent to a 16 - inch bike - and attach pedals to it			0
engineer , @entity60 , 33 , set up the company @entity101 in his hometown of @entity103 , @entity104			1
‘ the @entity11 is great for kids aged two to seven as it allows them to learn to balance and steer with the comfort of having their feet near the ground , ’ he said			1
‘ while sitting on the low saddle , the child pushes off the ground with their feet " @entity115 " style and as their confidence increases they can glide along easily			0
’ the third stage means the bicycle can be converted into a proper pedal bike			2
he said : ‘ it 's suitable for kids up to age seven and there 's no need for stabilisers			0
‘ having learned to balance first , the child will have a quick and effortless transition to the pedal bike			2
‘ these adaptions allow the @entity11 to be used for five years , over twice as long as traditional kids bikes , while giving the parent good value for money			2
‘ it 's high quality and built like a proper bike , unlike many of the throwaway kids bikes that are currently on the market			0
’ the bike is made from aluminium and weighs 11.3 lbs ( 5.1kg ) in its simplest form and 14.6 lbs ( 6.6kg ) fully extended with pedals			0
it can be bought online from @entity11 's website for £ 155 ( $ 243 )			1
phase two : by moving and reattaching the rear frame , the bike can be turned into a larger balance bike with a taller seat and handlebars ( pictured ) phase three : as a child becomes bigger , parents can increase the bike to its largest size - equivalent to a 16 - inch bike - and attach pedals to it ( pictured )			1

an engineer from @entity103 , @entity104 , came up with the extendable bike
configuration of ‘ @entity11 ’ changes to fit children from 2 - 7 years ' old
bike has three adjustable sizes so it grows longer and taller
the bicycle starts its evolution as a pedal-less balance bike and because of this , children easily learn to ride without needing stabilisers
bike is available to buy online for £ 155 ( $ 243 )
