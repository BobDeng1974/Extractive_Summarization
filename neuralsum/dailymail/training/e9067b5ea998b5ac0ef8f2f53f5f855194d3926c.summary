' worse still , his wife had suffered breast cancer			0
she was through it now but stress is bad for someone who is going through that			0

for him these allegations do n't stand up			2
he and his wife had suffered badly			0
' he said his accuser was ' out to make money ' and asked : ' why wait 20 years until it comes out in one - sided press coverage ? ' ' this is just someone else who can smell money and is jumping into the game to see what they can get out of it , ' he told police			1

asked about claims that he had told the woman she had ' won the keys to his room ' , he claimed it was not the type of thing he would say			2

' @entity3 also told police that he had ' great sympathy ' with rape victims and had been involved in attempts to stop it in his work for children 's charities			1
' but he did n't see the similarity between this and grabbing a girl 's bum in a dance , ' ms @entity170 said			0

' i was completely taken aback , it was just unexpected			0
i felt it was sleazy , there was absolutely no option for me than to move			0
' i was rather embarrassed and i was embarrassed for him about this kind of behaviour , it was just so inappropriate			0
' star : the claims against @entity3 date back to the height of his fame as a dj and presenter in the 1970s the reporter said that after the incident she ' pretended it did n't happen ' , while @entity3 appeared ' sheepish '			1
she asked @entity3 to give her a lift to the local train station , where she took a photograph of the pair together			1
' i did feel it was a really embarrassing situation and it was , i guess an attempt to make light of the situation , ' the woman told the court			1
she said that the @entity11 ' pulled her towards him and we ended up standing cheek to cheek ' , adding : ' that 's not the photograph i wanted			0
' i have interviewed many , many famous people in my journalistic career and most of the time they are pleasant people			2
' my only explanation was that he must have felt really sheepish about what happened			0
' i think the situation was so awkward , it was obvious this elderly gentleman who i had never heard of before completely crossed the line			0
it must have been embarrassing for him			0
