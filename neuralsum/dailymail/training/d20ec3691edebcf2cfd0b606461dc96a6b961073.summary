by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have launched a sperm bank for endangered animals in the hope of one day recreating animal populations on other planets			1
using freeze - drying technology , the researchers have successfully preserved sperm taken from two endangered primates and a type of giraffe			1
the long - term aim of the breakthrough is to take genetic information into space and spread animal populations among future colonies			1
@entity2 scientists have successfully preserved sperm taken from two endangered primates ( perhaps like the mountain gorillas pictured ) and a type of giraffe			1
the long - term aim of the research is to take genetic information into space and spread animal populations among future colonies the team at @entity29 's @entity28 , mixed the sperm of the endangered creatures with special preservation liquid			1
they then freeze - dried it in a way that allows them to store it at just 4 degrees @entity38 , according to associate professor @entity39 , who led the experiment			2
the temperature is much higher and less energy intensive than conventional ways of storing sperm			0
professor @entity39 and his researchers have previously successfully freeze - dried sperm from rats and mice without the use of bulky liquid nitrogen equipment and were able to prove the viability of the spermatozoa up to five years later			0

the temperature is much higher and less energy intensive than conventional ways of storing sperm ( pictured ) ' in this way , scientists will be able to obtain genetic information more easily , which means we could help to preserve endangered animal species , he said			2
professor @entity39 is quick to point out that there is presently no human application for the technology , but adds it is an avenue that may be explored in the future			0
' this may sound like a dream , but we could in future take genetic information into space , ' he said , adding it may allow for the transfer of material to help establish animal populations on future colonies			2

the picture shows a rat which delivered oocytes , or eggs , fertilized with freeze - dried sperm stored for five years in ampules ( pictured right ) more immediately , the technology makes it possible to store sperm at room temperature for short periods , meaning it would be safe in the event of power failures caused by a natural disaster , for example			0
the challenge now , said professor @entity39 , is to develop a way to apply the method to the other side of the procreative equation			0
' now we have to use fresh eggs or those frozen conventionally [ and ] we are studying methods to freeze - dry eggs as well			0
