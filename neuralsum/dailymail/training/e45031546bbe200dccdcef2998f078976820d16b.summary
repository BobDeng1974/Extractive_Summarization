like many real ales , its quirky name helps it to stand out from the crowd			0
unfortunately for a brew branded ' @entity6 ' , it stood out a little too much for one female @entity8 mp who has managed to have it banned from a @entity11 bar			1
@entity12 , the party 's equalities spokesman , said she found the beer – which has a pump plate with a cartoon picture of a bikini - clad bunny girl – offensive , adding later that it ' demeans women '			1
off the menu : the pump plate for @entity6 beer , which was banned from @entity25 's bars after a complaint from @entity8 shadow minister @entity12 ' demeaning to women ' : @entity12 , @entity8 's equalities spokesman , said she found the beer offensive despite never having even seen the pump in question – and the bar not receiving a single complaint – miss @entity12 yesterday stood up in the @entity35 chamber to demand it be removed from sale			1
last night , however , her stance provoked a backlash from men and women alike who branded her ' humourless ' and criticised her ' knee - jerk puritanism '			1
@entity45 's @entity44 , meanwhile , the ale 's family - run @entity47 brewery , said the outcry had seen its orders double			1
the £ 2.70 - a - pint beer was banned from the @entity53 , where @entity54 can take guests , within an hour of miss @entity12 's complaint			1
@entity58 sir @entity57 intervened to rid @entity25 of what he called ' offensive pictures '			2
miss @entity12 , mp for @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63 , brought up the issue at business questions in the @entity35 , where she called for a debate in the @entity11 on ' dignity at work in @entity25 '			2
she took up parliamentary time to say : ' i was disturbed last night to learn that the guest beer in the @entity53 is called @entity6 , and that there is a picture of a nearly naked woman on the tap			0
' she said later on @entity76 that it ' demeans women '			1
but many mps did not share her outrage			0
@entity82 @entity81 asked on @entity76 : ' why is a beer called @entity6 offensive & now banned from @entity35 ? ' furore : ms @entity12 called for a debate on ' dignity at work in @entity25 ' and asked sir @entity57 to back her demands for @entity6 to be withdrawn @entity88 , commons speaker @entity89 's wife , wrote on @entity76 : ' can not * believe * that there 's a beer called @entity6 on sale in the @entity35 ! outrageous - does mr @entity93 know ? ' fellow @entity96 mp @entity95 tweeted : ' @entity98 = sense of humour - free zone			1
banning of the @entity6 beer was weak @entity103 decision and gives sensible pro-women advocates a bad name			0
' the ale – described as ' blonde , full bodied with a voluptuous hop aroma ' – had been introduced as a guest ale by @entity82 @entity110 , mp for @entity111 , where it is brewed			0
mr @entity110 said : ' these guest ale slots offer a very welcome opportunity for small independent breweries like @entity45 's to reach a wider audience with their products , some of which have cheeky names			0
' the ban was also denounced by @entity122 , @entity111 's @entity123 , and @entity124 , director of think - tank the @entity126			2
mr @entity122 said : ' miss @entity12 really is a humourless sort			2
this sort of knee - jerk puritanism does more to damage the cause of equality than a thousand beer labels			2
' and miss @entity124 said : ' what really demeans women is the idea that we 've no sense of humour – and mps acting as sanctimonious killjoys in our name			1
' last night @entity45 , of @entity142 's @entity44 , said : ' at first i just could n't believe it that in this economic climate a @entity8 mp would get exercised about the name of a beer			1
' but all this publicity has been a blessing			0
after the fuss , it sold out immediately			0
people have been phoning from all over @entity153 asking us to supply their pubs			0
we 're delivering twice as much @entity6 tomorrow as we ever have before			0

@entity8 's equalities spokesman @entity12 claims beer is offensive and ' demeans women '
