by @entity0 the ice caves of @entity2 are virtually impenetrable for most explorers - but for a drone , they are easy to get in of			1
a team of filmmakers took their quadcopter to a remote series of caves to create this incredible footage of the area rarely seen by humans			1
the team was able to fly through channels in the ice to gain entry to caves , and fly high above the breathtaking terrain to show the scales of the ice caves			1
the idea came from @entity36 , which sells the quadcopters , ' @entity33 , the producer of the film , told @entity38			0
the video , part of a film project entitled ' @entity42 , ' was produced in collaboration with @entity44 , an aerial film production company			0
' they lent us a quadcopter for a film we 're making on snowmobiling , and wanted to collect images and videos that are inspiring , videos of awe			0
' we were thinking about what to shoot , originally we thought of really beautiful places like flower gardens in @entity56			0
' we decided to go out to the glaciers , then as soon as we saw the ice caves , we spent four days filming them			1
the drone was able to enter caves humans would struggle to get into the team flew the drone around several caves in the area , a glacier about 12 miles ( 19 km ) long			1
it is located in @entity67 , about 12 miles ( 19 km ) from downtown @entity68 in the southeast area of the @entity71 state of @entity2 , and is a popular tourist destination			2
it uses a standard , off the shelf drone called a @entity76 for the footage , which was captured on a @entity26 digital camera attached to the drone , along with a heavier duty drone			2
' there were a lot of nervous moments , ' admitted @entity33			0
' in the ice caves , these drones transmit the video , so we can send it into small crevasses			2
' we had problems losing signal in there , they are hundreds of feet of ice think			0
' there was also a lot of of turbulence in the caves caused by the four blades - we almost lost the quadcopters a few times			0
' into the abyss : the drone flew down into caves and up through holes to return to the surface the drones were also able to fly high above the caves to capture the stunning landscape			1
