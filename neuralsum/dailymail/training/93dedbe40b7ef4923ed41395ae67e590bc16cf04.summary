@entity0 is certainly known as a sharp shooter but the @entity4 striker 's rifle celebration has come under fire since his sending off at @entity6 last friday			1
the @entity8 star , who scored @entity4 's winner in the @entity10 at @entity11 on tuesday and again pretended to shoot , is in fact an avid hunter			1
hence , when @entity14 fires in one of his many goals he performs a gun - toting gesture , similar to that of a huntsman			1
@entity0 was eventually sent off after celebrating his goal at @entity6 on friday with a gun - toting gesture @entity0 ( right ) repeated the celebration , which he has used for years , on tuesday in the @entity10 the 27 - year - old celebrated his goal with his customary ' rifle ' celebration that hit the headlines last week remarkably , he was booked at @entity6 last friday after converting a penalty and carrying out his celebration , which he has used for years			1
he was then , however , sent off after becoming embroiled in a heated argument with referee @entity30			1
his father @entity31 revealed before the @entity32 that @entity0 , on a 48 - hour break from the @entity35 training camp , returned to his home town of @entity37 for a nocturnal hunting session , during which he managed to haul two boars and six hares			1
' it 's always been football first , then hunting for @entity0			1
he loves it and he 's a good shot at both ! ' @entity31 told the @entity45			0
cavani and his father hunt near a picturesque farm the @entity4 star bought for @entity31 last year			1
@entity4 players argue with referee @entity30 as @entity0 is given his marching orders at @entity6 last friday ' we always did it when he was a kid and we still do			1
he came here from the camp in @entity56 and everything he had n't done in a whole year while he 's been in @entity58 , he has to cram in over two days , ' added @entity31 before the @entity32			2
' so we spent them fishing and hunting , getting only three hours sleep both nights			2
it was crazy but he did it			0
' @entity0 's not going to stop doing it ! as for fishing , he always says it calms him			2
this has always been a way of life for us			0
' @entity4 forward @entity0 can not believe his red card during the clash with @entity6 so , @entity0 's hunting roots explain the background of his rifle celebration and the striker defended his actions having repeated the gesture after scoring the winner in @entity81 on tuesday			1
' the most important thing for a striker is to score			2
the most important thing for the team was to make a step further in the @entity10			2
' that was my decision to do that , this time it will not be misinterpreted			0
my expulsion against @entity6 ? we all have the right to make mistakes			0
we are all human beings , television pictures seem obviously in my favour			0
it was not bad , it just was misinterpreted			0
i work hard to perform well for my team to score goals			0
' @entity0 , seen scoring for @entity8 in the @entity32 this summer , went home to hunt on a break from training @entity4 president @entity104 has strongly criticised the referee 's decision to send off @entity107 at @entity6 , insisting punishments given for such celebrations are negative for @entity111 football			1
' it is the media 's job to speak about the referee , ' he told @entity116 +			0
' @entity0 does not deserve that red card			2
and why has he got a yellow before ? he always does the same celebration			0
' this is not normal and it is not good for @entity111 football if we want to develop			0
it is a bad situation for everyone			0

@entity4 striker @entity0 was sent off on friday following a gun - toting celebration and argument with the referee
