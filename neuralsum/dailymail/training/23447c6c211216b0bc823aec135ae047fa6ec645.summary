by @entity0 published : 17:41 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 18:57 est , 15 july 2013 countryside campaigners will target mps at the next election , demanding that they back reforms to planning laws			1
they say measures brought in by the government will allow the greenbelt to be destroyed and threaten thousands of acres of rural land			2
the campaign to @entity11 will ask every @entity12 , @entity13 or @entity14 candidate to sign a charter to save the @entity17 countryside			1
sir @entity18 , the @entity19 , is president of @entity20 , and has named the planning minister ' @entity22 ' sir @entity18 , president of the @entity20 , yesterday came close to saying his group ’s 70,000 supporters should vote @entity13 – which has vowed to tear up the @entity27 ’s planning policy rules , unless @entity28 and @entity14 change their minds			1
sir @entity18 , the former poet laureate , said he would demand that all three parties ’ manifestos included changes to planning policy			0
he said that otherwise ‘ that will be @entity11 gone ’			0
the charity yesterday issued a charter , ‘ @entity40 ’ , calling for brownfield land to be built on before greenfield , more say for communities in planning decisions and a focus on better - designed , ‘ sensitively located ’ affordable homes			1
@entity20 chief executive @entity45 said @entity46 is ‘ in denial ’ about the effect of his government ’s planning changes on the countryside			1
he said the @entity20 would join the @entity52 and other campaigners to press for reform , adding : ‘ we will be seeking as many meetings with prospective parliamentary candidates as possible , asking them to commit to the principles in the charter			1
’ the dramatic intervention will make the countryside a central feature of the general election in 2015 , just as candidates were pressured to oppose university tuition fee rises in 2010			1
as a charity , the @entity20 can not endorse political candidates , but its army of supporters could well hit the streets for those who share their views			1
sir @entity18 said : ‘ we want to use our charter to influence the general election manifestos of all parties			2
’ the @entity72 , introduced this year , says councils must promote ‘ sustainable development ’ in planning decisions			0
critics say it weakens protections against building on greenfield land			0
asked if the @entity20 would tell members to vote @entity13 because of its pledge to reform the @entity72 , sir @entity18 said : ‘ vote for the right policies is the right answer			1
' @entity20 chief executive @entity45 said @entity46 is ' in denial ' about the effect of his government 's planning changes on the countryside it certainly does need reforming and if the @entity13 is the only party which does do the reforming , people can make their own deductions from that			1
’ he added : ‘ the countryside is not something we can afford to take or leave			2
‘ we made it together over many centuries , it is our great communal masterpiece , the greatest thing we have ever made as a nation			0
once we have ruined it we ca n’t “ un-ruin ” it			0
’ calling the situation an ‘ emergency ’ , sir @entity18 added : ‘ that will be @entity11 gone			0
that is why we need this charter			2
‘ we want [ ministers ] to see that the @entity72 is not working despite what seem to be its original good intentions			2
’ mr @entity45 is seeking talks with @entity46 , who holds the rural @entity115 seat of @entity116			0
he said : ‘ a lot of development is planned for the future on greenfield sites			0
we think the government is in denial about the consequences of its policies			0
‘ i think in particular the prime minister is in denial about what is happening on the ground – and about rising anger			0
‘ we ’re working on all three party manifestos			0
' the @entity20 is a charity and we ’re careful to avoid any hint of being party political but i hope the prime minister in particular – who i believe does genuinely care about the countryside – will take notice .			1

campaign group claims we are at ' grave risk ' of losing open spaces
it is issuing a charter to pressure ministers not to *sacrifice* the countryside
