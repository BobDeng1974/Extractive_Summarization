one year on : @entity0 is spending his days in literal solitary confinement at @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 one year ago today he and his brother killed three people and wounded 260 with two home - made pressure cooker bombs at the @entity9			1
two days after the worst terror attack on @entity12 soil since 9/11 the then 19 - year - old @entity0 went to a party and acted as if nothing had happened before launching a rampaging killing and kidnapping spree across @entity17 with his older brother , @entity18			1
now he languishes inside a federal medical prison , where he can not watch television , read newspapers and is being urged to convert to @entity22 by his many supporters on the outside who believe he is innocent			1
imprisoned at the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , on 30 charges of terror - 17 of which carry the death penalty - @entity0 , 20 , only receives visits from his legal team , a psychiatrist and his immediate family			1
he is allowed one phone call a week and one letter - three pages , double sided - and any newspapers he gets have the classified ads and letters to the editor ripped out			1
this is because the government fears any coded messages to the young man who allegedly confessed to a jihad against the @entity12 from his hospital bed after he was shot during his gunfight in suburban @entity17 four days after the bombings			2
@entity47 : @entity0 is currently languishing in near total isolation at the center while he recovers from his wounds and waits for his november trial he has reportedly recovered from wounds to his neck , arms , hands and legs sustained during the bloody gun battle on @entity17 's streets following the murder of @entity63 police officer @entity62			1
held under special administrative measures approved by the @entity12 attorney general , @entity0 is treated as one of the most dangerous inmates in federal custody and a court order bars his legal team or family from talking about anything he may have said to them			0
since he ran over and killed @entity18 during the dramatic @entity77 shootout days after the bombings , the only glimpse into @entity0 's life has been when it was revealed he told his parents in @entity81 that ' everything is good ' in a phone call			1
indeed , despite his restricted communication with the outside world , @entity0 has been sent thousands of letters - most offering support , some protesting his innocence and others trying to convince him to convert to @entity22			1
twin detonations : runners continue to run towards the finish line of the @entity9 as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race in april last year surrender : @entity0 , bloody and disheveled with the red dot of a rifle laser sight on his forehead , raises his hand from inside a boat at the time of his capture by law enforcement authorities in @entity77 , @entity4 on april 19 , 2013 one such backer is @entity107 , a 35 - year - old single mother from @entity108 who told the @entity109 she has written to @entity0 10 times a month since the april 15 attacks			1
she writes him letters about the latest hip - hop albums from @entity114 and the latest @entity116 release			2
she has even sent him @entity118 cards and a birthday card - both of which have been returned			0
however , other letters have not been sent back - but @entity107 has not yet received one reply from him			0
moreso , @entity107 is adamant that @entity0 did not commit the bombings and that the state is lying in its case against him			0
captured : this frame grab from a video released by the @entity127 on thursday , april 18 , 2013 , shows suspect , @entity0 walking along @entity128 in @entity17 on april 15 ' you can tell he did nâ€™t do it , ' she said			1
' there is too much suspicious stuff going on in this case			0
' as @entity0 's legal team prepare for his november trial , they have begun to complain about intentionally interference from the prosecutors - who they accuse of dragging their heels on releasing their files			0
one reason why he is kept almost to solitary confinement is to halt any attempts he may make to recruit others			1
after his capture , ' @entity0 reaffirmed his commitment to jihad and expressed hope that his actions would inspire others to engage in violent jihad , ' the @entity147 stated in a court filing in august			0
and it seems that these visits are not recorded without prejudice towards the 20 - year - old bomber			2
indeed , earlier this year , an @entity127 agent allegedly overheard @entity17 marathon suspect @entity0 make a ' statement to his detriment ' when his sister visited him in prison			2
suspects : this combination of images released by the @entity127 on thursday , april 18 , 2013 , shows @entity0 and his older brother @entity18 on april 15 on @entity128 in @entity17 prosecutors did not reveal what @entity0 said , but they objected to what they called an attempt by @entity0 's lawyers to suppress the statement			1
@entity0 made the remark when an investigator working for his lawyers accompanied @entity0 's sister to a prison visit , a meeting that was monitored by an @entity127 agent , prosecutors said			0
the defense investigator started to explain to @entity0 's sister the rationale behind special restrictions placed on @entity0 in prison , prosecutors said			0
they say @entity0 , ' despite the presence of an @entity127 agent and an employee of the federal public defender , was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent			0
' @entity0 , 20 , has pleaded not guilty in a terror attack at last year 's marathon			2
two pressure cooker bombs were placed near the marathon finish line , killing three people and injuring more than 260			2
prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against @entity0 for crimes that include using a weapon of mass destruction			0
@entity0 's lawyers say the presence of the @entity127 agent during prison visits by @entity0 's two sisters ' has thwarted the defense ability to develop important mitigation information			0
