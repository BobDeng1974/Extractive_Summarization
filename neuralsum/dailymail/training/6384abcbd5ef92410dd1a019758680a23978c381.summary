the southwestern @entity0 has fifty percent change of suffering a ' megadrought ' that lasts 35 years , scientists have warned			1
they say they are ' not optimistic ' of the chances of avoiding huge droughts			0
they say global warming has meant the chance of a decade long drought is at least 50 percent , and the chances of a ' megadrought ' – one that lasts up to 35 years – ranges from 20 to 50 percent over the next century			1
beyond the @entity0 , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity37 basin are also vulnerable to the possibility of a megadrought			1
the study by @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 researchers will be published in a forthcoming issue of the @entity47 's @entity46			0
' for the southwestern @entity0 , i 'm not optimistic about avoiding real megadroughts , ' said @entity16 , @entity41 assistant professor of earth and atmospheric sciences and lead author of the paper			2
' as we add greenhouse gases into the atmosphere – and we have n't put the brakes on stopping this – we are weighting the dice for megadrought			2
' as of aug. 12 , most of @entity23 sits in a @entity64 ' exceptional drought , ' which is in the most severe category			1
@entity66 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity67 and @entity68 loiter in a substantially less severe @entity70 moderate drought			2
@entity16 says climatologists do n't know whether the severe western and southwestern drought will continue , but ' with ongoing climate change , this is a glimpse of things to come			1
' it 's a preview of our future , ' he said			1
while the @entity79 in the @entity80 lasted four to eight years , depending upon location , a megadrought can last more than three decades , which could lead to mass population migration on a scale never before seen in this country			1
@entity16 said that the @entity17 and @entity18 must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long - drought scenarios			1
' this will be worse than anything seen during the last 2,000 years and would pose unprecedented challenges to water resources in the region , ' he said			1
researchers warn the @entity17 and @entity18 must look for mitigation strategies to cope with looming long - drought scenarios in computer models , while the southern portions of the western @entity0 ( @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 ) will likely face drought , the researchers show the chances for drought in the northwestern states ( @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 ) may decrease			1
prolonged droughts around the world have occurred throughout history			0
@entity16 points to the recent ' @entity103 ' in @entity35 and modern - era drought in @entity105			2
as evidenced by tree - ring studies , a megadrought occurred during the 1150s along the @entity109			2
@entity110 drops to it 's lowest water level ever as a 14 year drought continues throughout the @entity0			0
pictured is the @entity114 , once know as boulder dam which lies on the border of @entity24 and @entity117			0
the dam is at it 's lowest level dropping more than 130 feet			0
in natural history , they occur every 400 to 600 years			0
but by adding the influence of growing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere , the drought models – and their underlying statistics – are now in a state of flux			0
beyond the @entity0 , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity37 basin are also vulnerable to the possibility of a megadrought			0
with increases in temperatures , drought severity likely will worsen , ' implying that our results should be viewed as conservative , ' the study reports .			0

@entity18 has fifty percent change of suffering a ' megadrought ' that lasts 35 years
@entity23 drought is ' a preview of our future '
drought could be worst seen for 2,000 years
could lead to mass population migration on a scale never before seen in this country
