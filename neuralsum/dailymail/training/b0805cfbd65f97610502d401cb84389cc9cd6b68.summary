by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 09:20 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 10:07 est , 5 december 2012 after a three - year saga over the fate of the @entity6 , it looks like it will become the new home of @entity9			2
the east @entity11 football club have been named as the top choice to move in to the @entity6 when it reopens , it was announced today the @entity15 board ( @entity15 ) unanimously made the decision in favour of the @entity19 club ahead of rivals from @entity21 in association with @entity23 , @entity24 of @entity25 and @entity26			1
we 're moving , lads : @entity9 are ready to leave their @entity29 home a new dawn : the @entity6 is set to host football in the future @entity34 competed against rivals @entity9 for the keys to the arena @entity15 chairman and @entity11 mayor @entity38 said : ' we had four good bids , as everybody knows			1
' the bid that has been ranked top is @entity9			1
i am very pleased about that			2
@entity9 vice-chairman @entity46 ' it will , if it goes through , mean a football legacy for the stadium but there is still a lot of negotiation to go on between the @entity15 and @entity9 about the terms of the deal			2
' the choice of @entity9 as tenants on a 99 - year lease came after a bitter drawn - out battle with other businesses over who would be chosen to have the tenancy of the 80,000 seat arena			1
three men have been charged with fraud after claims that @entity34 hired private investigators to snoop on @entity9 as the clubs battled over the @entity6			1
the trio are alleged to have accessed telephone bills and other private records of @entity9 vice-chairman @entity46 illegally			2
they appeared before @entity72 on november 28 , and had their case sent to @entity75 , where they are due to appear on february 1 , 2013			2
the @entity11 club denied putting officials under surveillance			1
there is still plenty of hard talking to go on before @entity9 move in , which is not likely to be until the 2016 - 17 season if it happens			2
the decision for it to go to the club , which has long been regarded as inevitable because of the lack of any other long - term financially viable options , comes with a number of expected caveats			1
the mayor , who did not elaborate during the two - hour meeting said : ' there ’s a lot of negotiations still to go on with @entity9			2
if we ca n’t do a deal , the stadium will still have a fantastic future with plan @entity100 ' but we have plenty of time to get in a football solution by 2016 - 17			2
' the @entity19 club , who have offered £ 15million in cash plus a minimum £ 9m - a - year in rent and share of commercial revenues to help pay for the renovation costs , must also help to fill the funding gap in the building work necessary to transform a track and field venue into a multi-sports arena			1
@entity116 competes in the long jump in the @entity6 , @entity118 - which could be now the home of @entity9 @entity121 's @entity120 won the men 's 5000m final at the @entity6 , surrounded by thousands of cheering spectators decisions , decisions : @entity11 mayor @entity38 has been at the centre of plans november 2010 : @entity9 and @entity34 lead stadium bid february 2011 : @entity9 win backing of @entity130 bosses april 2011 : spurs , @entity26 and an anonymous party launch legal bids over decision october 2011 : government confirms collapse of @entity9 bid december 2011 : @entity130 bosses relaunch tender process march 2012 : four bidders submit new proposals after 16 parties expressed an interest july to august 2012 : stadium hosts @entity130 and @entity144 december 2012 : decision made on successful bidder the hole in the projected £ 150m finances necessary to install a new roof , retractable seating over the running track and corporate boxes is now less than £ 20m			1
@entity9 believe the overall building costs could be less in the current market with no tenders yet taking place for the work			2
@entity9 , with partners @entity158 , were initially successful in their bid for the stadium but the deal collapsed in october 2011 after challenges from @entity34 and @entity26 and an anonymous complaint to the @entity164			1
there is still the fear of a fresh round of legal disputes over @entity9 ’s occupancy led by @entity26 chairman @entity170 , whose bid for a groundshare was turned down by the @entity15			1
@entity170 , who fears that @entity26 will go out of business within five years of @entity9 moving into a stadium so close to the @entity176 club , was waiting until today ’s verdict before deciding on whether to legally challenge the decision in the courts			1
@entity158 's contributions of over £ 60m to the funding adds to the complications			0
it was their original deal with @entity9 in 2011 that caused a legal wrangle , after a complaint was lodged to the @entity187 , claiming that @entity189 ’s financial assistance was an illegal subsidy			0
there is now a @entity164 investigating state aid in football , but the @entity15 is confident that the @entity9 deal will pass the state aid test			0
will the athletics track have to go ? not if the next generation of @entity198 and company are going to have something to run on in five years ’ time			0
the stadium will host the 2017 @entity203 after @entity205 ’s persuasive powers proved instrumental in bringing yet another major sporting event to @entity11 following the best @entity130 in @entity207 will the seating work in such a large venue ? here ’s where the money starts mounting up			0
a key part of @entity9 ’s bid is to retain the running track but they do not want fans match - day experience to suffer			0
the plan is to install retractable seating to slide over the running track to ensure @entity9 ’ fans continue to get a close up view of their club ’s @entity223 the venue get a roof ? mercifully the weather held out for those magical nights in august but the stadium was originally conceived as a summer venue			1
another chunk of cash has been earmarked to extend the venue ’s circular roof to protect @entity9 fans from the unpredictable @entity236 much is all this going to cost ? converting the iconic venue to one which fits the bill for the @entity19 , and one which can also cater for athletics and pop concerts , wo n’t come cheap			0
estimates for the work range between £ 130million up to £ 200m and it is worth remembering the stadium cost £ 429m to put up in the first @entity249 who is going to cough up ? well , @entity9 are willing to part with £ 15m towards the conversion plus £ 9million annually in rent and cash from commercial proceeds			0
fellow tenants , @entity158 , are in for between £ 40m and £ 60m while the @entity256 has reached into its pockets for another £ 38million			0
some shortfall estimates for the work range between £ 15 and £ 20m although @entity9 argue that the cost of the conversion is covered with the cash already on the @entity262 is starting to sound like a cracking deal for @entity9 - are they getting a 60,000 stadium for a knockdown price ? there is little doubt that moving home would do wonders financially for a club currently around £ 80 million in debt and turning over around £ 80 million a year , provided they can maintain their top flight status			1
do so and the match day revenue generated by the move to @entity118 will dwarf the £ 18m they pull in annually at @entity29			0
@entity277 and @entity278 shelled out in the region of £ 50m to buy a 50 % controlling stake in @entity9 in january 2010 and a @entity19 club with an iconic , @entity283 home could certainly be an attractive proposition for outside investors			1
but one of the caveats of @entity9 ’s lease is expected to be that they share a slice of the profits with taxpayers if @entity291 and @entity278 eventually decide to cash @entity292 off to the @entity293 we go then ? romantic though that sounds , there is little prospect that @entity9 will not attempt to sell the naming rights to their new ground			0
@entity300 get an estimated £ 400m from @entity301 to have the airline ’s name emblazoned on what was the @entity301 , constructed for the 2006 @entity305			0
and while @entity9 are unlikely to strike a deal of that magnitude , the potential naming rights cash would be too tempting to turn down especially if it covered the £ 9m - a - year they are paying their @entity310 what happens to @entity9 ’s old @entity313 home ? flattened is the overwhelming expectation			0
a 99 - year lease on their new arena means the beige towers built from the proceeds of the £ 18m sale of @entity321 to @entity322 will slip into memory			0
potential buyers are already circling with community houses , flats and a supermarket the likely uses for the @entity329 will @entity9 move in ? prior to the last bidding process collapsing in may , the club reckoned they could be out of their present home by the summer of 2014			1
but as a result of the delays in reaching a decision about the fate of the @entity338 will need to extend that until at least the start of the2015 / 16 season			0
many feel that timescale errs on the optimistic side as the necessary construction work may take until the summer of 2016 to be finished			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
