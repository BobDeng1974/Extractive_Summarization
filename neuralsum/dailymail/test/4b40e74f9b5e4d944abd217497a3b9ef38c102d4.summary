the rampant @entity1 has extended its huge lead over @entity3 , polling showed last night			1
detailed constituency surveys suggest @entity3 faces an unprecedented wipeout			1
@entity6 , its @entity8 leader , and @entity10 , its chief election strategist , are among those on course to lose their seats			1
@entity6 ( left ) , @entity3 's @entity8 leader , and @entity10 ( right ) , the party 's chief election strategist could lose their seats the nationalists are also on course to wipe out the @entity21 in @entity8 , with even @entity22 , their popular former leader , now 15 points behind in his @entity25 constituency			1
the survey of eight constituencies , by @entity26 , revealed swings to the @entity1 on a scale which would be unprecedented in modern @entity32 politics			2
the survey suggests @entity3 could lose all 41 seats it won in 2010			2
tactical @entity36 voting by supporters of other parties could save some			0
there are 59 seats in @entity8			0
mr @entity6 is nine points behind in his @entity43 seat with the @entity1 buoyed by leader @entity45 ’s strong performance in two tv debates			2
that means there has been a 26.5 per cent swing away from @entity3 since 2010			0
@entity3 conceded that ‘ no gloss ’ could be put on the polls and warned that if the findings become reality then ‘ @entity52 will walk back into @entity53 again ’			0
@entity58 , of party supporters ’ website @entity56 , said : ‘ if previous @entity26 constituency polling in @entity8 could be described as an earthquake , the poll the @entity62 peer had dropped this afternoon will require an entirely different word			2
‘ if this is an earthquake it ’s certainly not the kind that rattles the windows in the middle of the night , it ’s the sort that razes whole cities			0
‘ if lord @entity26 ’s polling is correct , there ’s a risk that @entity6 could lose his seat to the @entity1			1
at the last poll he had a slender one point lead over the @entity1 , that has now turned in a matter of weeks into a nine - point lead for the @entity1			0
that ’s well outside the margin of error			0
the rampant @entity1 , led by @entity45 ( pictured ) , has extended its lead over @entity3 ‘ what was once a @entity3 / @entity62 marginal could well fall to the forces of separatism			1
such a result would be a painful – almost existential – blow to a @entity89 that is already battered and bruised			0
’ yesterday , mr @entity6 launched a desperate attempt to regain support by abandoning his @entity93 views in a bid to win over left - wing voters			0
mr @entity6 unveiled @entity3 ’s @entity8 election manifesto in @entity97 as he declared ‘ the party of @entity99 and the party of @entity101 is back in business ’			1
overlooking the @entity104 ‘ @entity3 ’ era , during which he served as a minister , he allowed retiring @entity3 mp @entity106 to whip the crowd into a frenzy by attacking @entity109 and laying into the @entity1 with the battle cry : ‘ they are nationalists , we are socialists			2
’ mr @entity6 himself vowed to introduce socialist - style ‘ redistributive ’ policies , as he accused the @entity1 of stealing @entity3 ’s clothes .			1
