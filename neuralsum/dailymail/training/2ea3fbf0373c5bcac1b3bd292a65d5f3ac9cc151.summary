the @entity42 has said it would be open to leaving no troops in @entity6 , though it 's likely that a small presence will remain , in keeping with the @entity48 's preferences			2
the skilful plan allows the military commanders in @entity6 the flexibility they require in controling the speed of the troop reductions			2
aware that the majority of fighting intensifies against the @entity57 from now until october , the military were keen to retain a significant force to allow them to mange their withdrawal			0
speaking to the @entity62 , @entity42 officials would not be pressed into revealing the exact timetable for the troop reductions - but said that numbers will fall to around 60,000 in spring			0
that number would remain through the fighting season and then would encounter the drop to 32,000 by this exact time next year			0

@entity2 discussed the next phases of the troop reduction with @entity6 president @entity94 during a day - long meeting in @entity96 last month , the first meeting between the two leaders since @entity2 's re-election			1
the two leaders agreed to accelerate their timetable for putting @entity6 forces in the lead combat role nationwide , moving that transition up from the summer to the spring			1
the @entity42 has a range of options to reduce troop levels in @entity6 and has been considering whether to leave no troops in country following the end of operations in 2014			2
the plans were drawn up by general @entity111 , who was until recently the @entity5 commander in the war - torn country and whose final days were smeared by his links to the scandal which caused the resignation of @entity118 as cia director			0

' today is not about change , it 's about continuity , ' said @entity123 at a change - of - command ceremony in @entity135 , progress : once the 34,000 troops are removed , the @entity5 force in the country will be cut in half ' i 'll endeavor to continue the momentum of the campaign and support the people of @entity6 as they seize the opportunity for a brighter future			1
' speaking earlier this year in january , president @entity2 confirmed that most @entity5 combat operations in @entity6 would end in spring			1

defense secretary @entity76 said today in a farewell speech at the @entity48 that he thought the @entity5 was pursuing the right strategy			0

some private security analysts , as well as some @entity48 officials , worry that pulling out of @entity6 too quickly will leave the battle - scarred country vulnerable to collapse			0
in a worst - case scenario , that could allow the @entity57 to regain power and revert to the role they played in the years before 9/11 as protectors of @entity188 terrorists bent on striking the @entity5 many @entity5 , however , are weary of the war , according to public opinion polls , and are skeptical of any claim that @entity6 is worth more @entity5 blood			2
