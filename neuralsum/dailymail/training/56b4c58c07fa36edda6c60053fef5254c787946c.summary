by @entity0 @entity2 ’s @entity1 - 2 satellite was getting ready to launch from @entity4 in @entity5 today at 10:56am bst ( 05.56 est )			1
but the launch was cancelled , despite @entity2 saying there was a zero per cent chance of failure , when a water flow problem was discovered			1
the next launch window for @entity12 , which will be the first dedicated @entity2 mission to monitor atmospheric carbon dioxide on global scales , could be as early as tomorrow			1
the launch took place at 10:56am bst today the satellite had to be launched at exactly the right time to ensure it entered the right orbit			1
the issue was with the pulse suppression water system			0
this protects the launch mount holding the rocket from the high temperatures of a launch			0
and it helps protect from the shockwave of ignition from the engine			0
the water flow would have begun at t - minus 45 seconds			1
but when it was found not to be working properly , the launch had to be cancelled for safety reasons			0
the soonest next launch could be tomorrow in what is known as a ' 24 hour recycle '			0
this will bring it in line with a series of other @entity51 - observing satellites known as the ‘ a-train ’			2
in fact , the orbit is so precise that there is only a 30 second launch window within which it can take off ; any delays and @entity2 will have to try again another day			2
that is the reason why today 's launch was cancelled , as the problem delayed the rocket lifting off by more than 30 seconds			1
launch cancellations of this sort are not uncommon though			0
@entity65 are a very dangerous business , so great care must be taken before attempting a launch and a host of safety checks must be met			0
even the most minor of faults can lead to a cancellation ; after all , @entity2 and other agencies would rather delay a launch by a day or two than lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment			2
just a week ago , for example , private company @entity76 delayed the launch of its own @entity80 rocket when an issue was discovered that threatened the success of the flight			2
@entity1 - 2 ( illustration shown ) is @entity2 's first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide , the leading human - produced greenhouse gas driving changes in @entity51 's climate according to @entity2			1
it will collect 24 measurements every second , totaling about a million every day @entity92 manager @entity91 of the agency 's @entity93 had previously told the launch team this morning that the countdown and conditions ' look very , very good '			0
lift - off ( zero seconds ) : three solid rocket motors are ignited			0
100 seconds after launch : the solid rocket motors are jettisoned as the rocket climbs to space			0
four minutes : main engine is cut off			0
four minutes and eight seconds : rocket splits in two as the stages separate			0
five minutes : nose cone opens up			0
10 minutes : second engine cuts out ( @entity109 - 1 )			0
11 minutes : the satellite coasts in space for 40 minutes			0
51 minutes : a second engine fires to place the satellite into the right orbit			0
56 minutes : final rocket engine separates from the satellite			0
45 days : first science observations of carbon dioxide levels on @entity51 begin			1
when the launch does take place , @entity12 will be carried into space by the @entity18 rocket			0
it is the second of five @entity51 science missions to be launched this year			1
@entity2 monitors @entity51 's vital signs from land , air and space with a fleet of satellites and airborne and ground - based observation campaigns			1
@entity131 is @entity2 ’s first mission dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide , the leading human - produced greenhouse gas driving changes in @entity51 ’s climate according to @entity2			1
it will collect 24 measurements every second , totaling about a million every day			0
of these , about 100,000 are expected to be sufficiently cloud free to provide highly usable carbon dioxide data			2
the best carbon dioxide - observing satellite currently in orbit takes 4 seconds to make one such observation and collects fewer than 20,000 pieces of data per day , with about 500 of those being highly useful			1
@entity1 - 2 studies carbon dioxide by looking at the colors ( or wavelengths ) of sunlight that carbon dioxide absorbs			1
to identify very small changes in this absorption from one wavelength to the next , the @entity1 - 2 instrument separates light into many narrow bands of wavelengths			2
but @entity131 's field of view is only about one square mile ( three square kilometers ) - smaller than @entity160 's @entity159			0
this allows it to dodge clouds , which regularly cover about two - thirds of @entity51 ; even a tiny wisp of cloud in @entity131 's view compromises the measurement			2
six to seven weeks after launch , @entity12 will be maneuvered into its final operational orbit in the a-train constellation , 438 miles ( 705 kilometers ) above @entity51			1
and the first science observations of carbon dioxide levels on our planet are slated to begin about 45 days after launch			1
technicians are seen making last minute preparations before the launch of the rocket			0
@entity2 had said there was zero chance of the launch being cancelled today			2
@entity1 - 2 will be able to pinpoint where the planet 's forests and ocean are reabsorbing atmospheric carbon , a cycle that is key to @entity51 's temperature pictured here is @entity4 in @entity5			1
the upper levels of the launch gantry can be seen , surrounding the @entity18 rocket with the @entity19 ( @entity1 - 2 ) satellite onboard , at the @entity196 on 29 june 2014 ' carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plays a critical role in our planet 's energy balance and is a key factor in understanding how our climate is changing , ' said @entity205 , director of @entity2 ’s @entity206 in @entity207			1
' with the @entity1 - 2 mission , @entity2 will be contributing an important new source of global observations to the scientific challenge of better understanding our @entity51 and its future			1
' @entity215 , @entity1 - 2 project scientist at @entity2 ’s @entity216 ( @entity216 ) , @entity217 , @entity5 , added : ' knowing what parts of @entity51 are helping remove carbon from our atmosphere will help us understand whether they will keep doing so in the future			1
' understanding the processes controlling carbon dioxide in our atmosphere will help us predict how fast it will build up in the future			0
' data from this mission will help scientists reduce uncertainties in forecasts of how much carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere and improve the accuracy of global climate change predictions			2
' the @entity18 rocket with the @entity19 ( @entity1 - 2 ) satellite onboard sits at the launch pad at the @entity4			1
about five minutes after launch the nose cone , pictured , will open up , unleashing the satellite into space and allowing it to enter its final orbit @entity245 , @entity1 - 2 science team leader at @entity216 ( @entity216 ) , left , and @entity246 , @entity1 - 2 deputy project scientist , also at @entity216 , are seen during a science briefing on 29 june 2014 ahead of the launch of the @entity1 - 2 satellite the spacecraft will sample the global geographic distribution of the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide and allow scientists to study their changes over time more completely than can be done with any existing data			1
since 2009 , @entity51 scientists have been preparing for @entity1 - 2 by taking advantage of observations from the @entity264 @entity263 satellite			1
@entity131 replaces a nearly identical @entity2 spacecraft lost because of a rocket launch mishap in february 2009			0
that was when the original @entity1 failed to separate during ascent , and subsequently re-entered the atmosphere , crashing into the @entity270 near @entity271			0
at approximately 400 parts per million , atmospheric carbon dioxide is now at its highest level in at least the past 800,000 years , according to @entity2			2
the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are currently adding nearly 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year , producing an unprecedented buildup in this greenhouse gas			2
@entity1 - 2 measurements will be combined with data from ground stations , aircraft and other satellites to help answer questions about the processes that regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide and its role in @entity51 ’s climate and carbon cycle			1
mission data will also help assess the usefulness of space - based measurements of carbon dioxide for monitoring emissions			2
@entity2 administrator @entity297 answers social media attendees questions on monday 30 june from just outside the launch pad where the @entity18 rocket with the @entity1 - 2 ( @entity19 - 2 ) satellite onboard will launch from the @entity18 rocket with the @entity1 - 2 satellite onboard , moments after the launch gantry was moved at the @entity21 , of the @entity4			1

@entity2 's @entity1 - 2 was launching today at 10:56am bst
but the launch was cancelled when a water flow problem was discovered
the event was taking place from @entity4 in @entity5
next opportunity for launch will be tomorrow from the same *location*
the reason for the cancellation at t - minus 46 seconds was because the rocket only had a 30 - second window within which to launch
when the issue was discovered @entity2 made the *decision* to hold the launch
the mission will be the first to monitor global carbon dioxide levels
it will take the rocket about an hour to place the satellite in the right orbit
this will be at a height of 438 miles ( 705 kilometres ) above @entity51 's surface
here it will join a series of other satellites known as the ' a-train '
this is the second of five @entity51 science missions to launch this year
