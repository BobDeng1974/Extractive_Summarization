@entity8 said they were considering bringing charges against former councillor @entity10 for breaching the peace and for allowing underage drinking in her home			1
mrs @entity10 's semi-detached house was trashed after her daughter @entity16 , 14 , advertised her birthday party on @entity7 and it was gatecrashed by hundreds of strangers who ripped doors off hinges , jumped through the loft floor , and scrawled on walls			1
drunk teenagers smashed holes in the ceiling , drew on walls and ripped doors off their hinges as around 800 youngsters descended on the @entity32 home an @entity8 spokeswoman said : ' police are working with the family and considering whether any offences have been committed and whether it is in the public interest to prosecute those responsible			1
' local officers are also in contact with residents of the street to establish a full picture of the events which took place			0
' the trail of destruction began when what was supposed to be an early 15th birthday party for @entity51 's 30 closest friends turned into chaos as up to 800 people arrived with bottles of alcohol having seen the party advertised on social media sites			1
the party was thrown by @entity51 , 14 , but got out of control despite her mother , @entity59 , 56 , being there to try and keep order discord : a piano was smashed up in the front garden before police dispersed the rowdy youngsters horde : crowds of people outside the home			1
they were made aware of the party through social media sites witnesses at the party claimed teenagers had broken into the loft and were bouncing on ceiling insulation before one fell through into the bedroom the party had been dubbed the ' @entity80 of @entity32 ' strangers from as far away as @entity82 and @entity83 arrived at the family home in @entity85 , @entity32 , and over the next couple of hours – before police arrived and called time – the youngsters left an extraordinary trail of destruction that will cost up to £ 30,000 to put right			1
offensive graffiti was scrawled on walls and shelves were pulled down with their contents scattered around			0
the ceiling was left with a gaping hole after a group of teenagers got into the loft and leapt around on the insulation before one fell through			0
rumours on @entity105 suggested a hedgehog was flushed down a toilet and someone defecated on a bed			0
another report suggested a grand piano had been thrown into the garden from the £ 305,000 five - bedroom semi-detached home			1
@entity16 ’s family denied this yesterday , saying it was an upright piano that had been in the garden at the start of the party but was destroyed by revellers			2
but one uncontested fact is that the 14 - year - old ’s mother , @entity59 , 56 , is now counting the cost following the sickening realisation their insurers will not pay for repairs as the revellers were invited into her home			2
why would they do this ? ’ said local church leader @entity131 , whose desperate pleas to party - goers were ignored as she tried to maintain control			2
‘ there must be £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 damage but insurance wo n’t pay out because we invited them in			1
‘ i told the parents i would be here to keep an eye out for trouble			0
there was n’t supposed to be drink but the police told me they confiscated an unbelievable amount of alcohol from the groups			0
’ aftermath : discarded alcohol lies strewn around the room among smashed and upended furniture debris : homeowner @entity10 knew the party had been advertised on @entity7 two weeks ago venue : the @entity85 house where the party was held			1
the damage caused by the party is estimated to be up to £ 30,000 wrecked : these cupboards were smashed open and ripped apart as drunk teens stormed the house destruction : a teenager was reported to have fallen through the ceiling as the party raged mrs @entity10 has yet to decide whether to press charges in relation to the damage caused by her home			1
she admitted she had ignored warnings two weeks ago from her daughter ’s school that trouble was expected			1
staff at @entity180 in @entity181 – rated one of the best state schools in the country – warned against the open invitation that had been posted on @entity7			2
but the mother of two , who is married to computer consultancy owner @entity187 , 60 , and has a daughter , @entity188 , 19 , said : ‘ i just did n’t think this would happen			0
i knew @entity16 knew some people but did not expect that many to turn up			0
’ the party , ahead of @entity16 ’s 15th in february , began at 7pm on friday and the chaos started within minutes , with people spilling out on to the road outside			0
one neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ it was like @entity198 in the 1970s out there			0
there were hundreds of people out to cause trouble			0
’ another said : ‘ it was absolute carnage as there were children pouring out of the house			0
‘ i would have said there was about 800 of them when the police turned up at around 8.30pm			2
they were trying to escape up the road , not realising it was a @entity214			0
’ @entity51 ’s name was even ‘ trending ’ on @entity105 at one stage due to the number of photographs being tweeted by revellers			0
@entity8 said no one was injured at the party – the party - goer who fell through the ceiling appears to have had a lucky escape as a double bed was immediately below			2

officers found a large number of teenagers had visited the area to attend a party advertised openly on social media			1
‘ no arrests were made and no complaints were made regarding criminal damage			0
’ invite : the party 's host @entity243 posting about the party on @entity7 @entity51 ¿ s name was even ¿ trending ¿ on @entity105 at one stage due to the number of photographs being tweeted by revellers three months ago 17 - year - old @entity252 student @entity251 was stabbed to death at a party in nearby @entity83 that was gatecrashed by youths who had learned about it on @entity7			1
and last week 21 - year - old @entity257 was convicted of causing a public nuisance after more than 1,000 attended a wild party advertised on social media , forcing @entity261 to call in reinforcements to close a nearby main road and disperse the crowds			1

‘ we were aware that the party was being advertised on @entity7 and advised the mother and daughter of the risks this posed			1
