a shocking video has been released showing four tourists they catching a bronzer shark in @entity3 , dragging the thrashing creature in to shore and then pose for photos with the creature			1
@entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are filmed by @entity11 , standing just centimetres away from the shark they 've captured in an activity that is terrifying but completely legal in @entity3 , to the point it has become a competitive sport			1
one of the man stands at the water 's edge with a fishing line in his hands and the waves lapping at his feet when suddenly he launches forward , dragged by the great weight of the creature who has attached itself to his fishing line			1
the first fisherman is dragged deep into the water from the water 's edge within seconds when the mighty shark takes hold of the end of his line once captured , one person brazenly opens the sharks mouth whilst the other removes the hook the fisherman and his friends whoop with excitement , certain they have achieved their goal : to catch a shark			1
the line spins rapidly as their catch continues to swim around and the fisherman is pulled deeper and deeper into the water at an alarming rate			0
the fisherman 's friend grabs hold of his shoulders and together they pull against the shark on the end of the line , determined to bring it into shore			1
as one person holds onto the line , a massive shark leaps out of the water less than two metres away , thrashing violently to try release itself from the hook			0
the three men in the video cheer excitedly , without a hint of apprehension			0
the shark is then pulled into shore , its huge teeth less than a metre away from the feet of the man who brazenly jerks it in to land			2
as the fisherman is dragged after the shark , his friend grabs hold of his shoulder and they forcefully pull the shark closer in to shore the video then cuts to a few moments later , as the shark , now inexplicably still and unresponsive , is pulled in to the sand by its tail			1
the three men on - camera comfortably stand next to the shark , centimetres away from its face and grab it by the head to release the hook			2
a man in shorts kneels next to the two metre shark in the water , holding it up by its fin and tail			0
the shark is then pushed back into water by its tail			0
for a moment the bronzer shark snaps its head around as if to attack , but it proceeds to swim back into deep waters			0
as it is legal to fish for sharks in @entity3 , it has become a sport known as ' big game fishing ' in which ' shark anglers ' catch and release the creatures			1
one of the men stands just a metre away from the thrashing shark to pull it onto the sand however , it crucial that the ' sport ' is only attempted by those that know the techniques which are safe for both the participant and the shark â€“ to ensure everyone involved remains alive			1
for many @entity3 it has become a business to allow people , particularly tourists , to take part in the land - based shark fishing catch and release experience			1
companies promise that participants can expect to ' catch fish such as large tiger sharks and hammerheads ' in places such as @entity3 's @entity143			1
shark fisherman focus on using peep release techniques ' to send sharks happily on their way after gaining ' biggest - catch ' bragging rights			2
' ' the ' catch and release ' philosophy is in keeping with @entity3 's dedication to conservation and sustainable fishing , ' according to the @entity3 tourism guide website			1
' even in non-release areas , many anglers adopt the catch and release principle , or simply bag only their last catch of the day to take home for eating			0
' for the sea creature to survive , it is crucial that people engaging in big - game fishing handle their catch minimally			1
the fisherman whoop and cheer with delight as the bronzer shark desperately tries to escape ' when using the catch and release method , anglers should realise that prolonged handling decreases the fish 's chances of survival , ' the website says			2
@entity3 even compete in big game finishing tournaments , including the ' @entity180 ' , which will be held from may 1 and offers prize money for the biggest catch			0
there are about 113 species of shark in @entity3 waters and of these more than 70 species are caught by fishers			2
in october 2014 @entity3 finally banned the practice of shark finning , a move that was seen as finally diminishing a primitive practice and ' bringing the country in line with other developed nations '			1
@entity3 's conservation minister @entity196 said the move reinforced the country 's reputation for sustainability and environmental protection			1
a man grins widely as he holds the shark near the water 's edge with a hand on its tail and another on its fin - but the shark does not turn around to snap at its captor the new rules made it illegal to remove fins from dead sharks and dump the carcasses at sea			0
it was already illegal in @entity3 to remove fins from live sharks			0
shark fin soup is considered a delicacy by some in @entity225			0
but the practice of shark finning has been condemned by many environmentalists as inhumane and wasteful			0
@entity228 estimates at least 100 million sharks are caught commercially each year , threatening the survival of some species			0
@entity3 officials estimate that commercial fishers catch about 20,000 tons of sharks annually and export about 121 tons of shark fins			2
@entity237 , director of @entity228 's global shark conservation campaign , said in an email the ban was an important first step , although was unlikely to reduce the numbers of sharks caught in @entity3			2
she said @entity228 would like to see nations impose complete bans on catching shark species threatened with extinction , and sustainable catch limits placed on other species			0
the shark is then released back into the ocean and it quickly swims back into deep waters			0

tourists posted a video of themselves dragging a shark onto shore
the clip shows them catching the huge shark with a fishing line on a @entity3 beach
they stand just centimetres away from the beast who thrashes *angrily*
catching and releasing a shark is a legal sport in @entity3
it 's crucial right techniques are used for safety of fisherman and shark
the shark should not be touch minimally , but in the video the tourists drag the shark in and pose for photos holding the creature
