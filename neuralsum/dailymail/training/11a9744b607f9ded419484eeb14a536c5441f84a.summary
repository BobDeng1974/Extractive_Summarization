by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 13 october 2013 updated : 09:27 est , 13 october 2013 wine making is often though of as a fine and delicate art , but as these pictures show it requires a good amount of hard graft and a good head for heights			0
these workers on the @entity9 and @entity11 wine estates are harvesting @entity13 grapes from precarious slopes near @entity15 in northwestern @entity16			1
the only way up or down the dizzying canyons is on foot or riding in a tractor , and the grapes themselves are transported in baskets suspended on wire down to the river below			0
these workers are on the @entity9 plots harvesting @entity13 grapes some of which will be used in the winemaker 's @entity30 red wine the @entity32 were the first to grow grapes here 2,00 years ago as they marched across @entity34 , followed by monks the dizzying slopes are so steep that they can only be accessed on foot by grape pickers who undertake the back - breaking work @entity41 helps to harvest grapes on the slopes of land owned by his relative , @entity45 on the banks of the @entity47 carries a box of grapes at a @entity9 's plot which produces red and white wine they are then taken by boat back to the @entity54 where they will be juiced and then fermented by @entity45 to make @entity57 wines			1
the @entity13 grapes are a red variety which produce the tradition wine of the region which has been making the alcoholic tipple for 2,000 years			1
the slopes were originally carved out by the @entity32 as they marched across @entity34			2
@entity63 then took over and carved terraces of vines into the slopes of the rivers @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
these workers on the @entity11 estate in @entity16 's @entity74 region have to climb up and down the rocky slopes to reach the river which transports the grapes as access to the slopes by vehicles is limited wine makers are forced to improvise , using makeshift pulley systems and boats to move their cargo @entity85 ( left ) , is the head winemaker for the @entity11 cellar , and is pictured placing boxes of grapes inside a boat in the isolated region @entity85 and his son @entity91 are just two producers in a region which now boasts tens of wineries producing thousands of bottles of wine a year @entity85 ( in red ) drives a boat with his daughter , friends and boxes of grapes along the @entity68 in the region of @entity103 in @entity104 however , in the 20th century a devastating plague of aphids killed off a lot of the plants before the @entity16 civil war rocked the economy , leading to farmers deserting in droves			1
as a younger generation fled poverty on the slopes for a more prosperous life in the cities , nature moved in to reclaim the land which crumbled into disrepair			0
as recently as 2009 many of the terraces were abandoned , though producers had started moving back to the region , determined to make it a success once more			2
as fruit pickers continue their work on the stony banks , a boat speeds away taking grapes back to the @entity132 winery for fermentation the @entity57 winery has won awards from both @entity16 and @entity136 since 1990 to recognise the quality of the wine it produces and its latest was given a distinction in 2011 the banks around the river @entity142 need to have ladders fitted on to them so the labourers can climb up to where the grapes are growing once the grapes are back at the winery more workers sort through them on a conveyor belt to remove any spoiled or unripe ones before they are juiced @entity85 pushes grapes down inside a barrel where they will sit while they ferment to make some of the region 's most famous wines attracted by the indigenous grapes , the slate and granite soils and peculiar microclimates of the rivers and terraces , winemakers are now turning out some award - winning bottles			1
dotting the old vineyards are lagares , crumbling stone structures that once provided shelter and a place to ferment grapes right in the vineyard			0
every family would have a lagar , to which they would carry the grapes at harvest			0
sometimes families would sleep there for the duration of harvest season and they are now being restored to use for storage and a place for vineyard workers to eat a meal away from the grueling heat of the sun. because of the vallies and rivers of the region it has a unique micro-climate similar to @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 in total 13 varieties of grape are grown in the region by more than 100 producers who call the breathtaking countryside home @entity45 , the owner of the @entity202 wine estate enjoys the relative luxury of driving a tractor on the hills which are usually too steep for vehicles the terraces have to be cut into the banks of the three rivers in the region because otherwise they would be impossible to work or plant on lagares are traditional stone huts built into the hills which are being restored to allow workers a place to relax from the heat or eat lunch with their fellow employees the conditions found in @entity104 are similar to those found in some of the world 's greatest wine regions such as @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			2
so far this year 3,720 tonnes of @entity13 grapes alone have been produced in the whole of the region , along with another 13 varieties being used to make both red and white wines			0
the term @entity104 means ' holy river bank ' and harks back to a time when the hills were full of monks brewing wine , instead of the intrepid farmers of today			1
the hills are still littered with a multitude of medieval monasteries , churches and chapels which overlook the rivers or nestle in gentler terrain nearby .			0

two wine estates in @entity16 's @entity74 region are carved into the steep hills
the region has been producing wine for 2,000 years since the @entity32 first planted vines
it was taken over by monks and the name @entity254 means ' holy river bank '
it was nearly abandoned because of a plague of aphids which devastated crops
today intrepid producers are harvesting thousands of tonnes of grapes from the slopes
