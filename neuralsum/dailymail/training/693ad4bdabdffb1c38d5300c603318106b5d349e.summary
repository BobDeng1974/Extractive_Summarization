but the truth of how most servants lived in @entity9 at the beginning of the twentieth century is a far cry from the soft - centred fiction portrayed in period dramas such as @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
clipping your master 's toenails , ironing his shoelaces , spending 17 - hour days doing back - breaking work with no employment rights were just some of the realities facing servants in late @entity26 and early @entity9 , according to a new @entity28 series			1
then and now : a young ' tweeny ' maid , left , in late nineteenth century @entity9 , and @entity15 's scullery maid @entity31 , played by @entity32			1
servants : the @entity33 explores the reality of life as a servant in @entity9 from the @entity26 era through to the @entity38			1
and it was n't exactly like @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity31 have it in @entity15			0
upon entering service , new servants were often given ' acceptable ' , easy to remember and generic names - @entity46 , @entity48 and @entity49 were popular choices for men , while many female servants were frequently named @entity53 or @entity54			1
moreover , if female servants received unwanted advances from their masters , they had little power to stop them			2
in her new , eye - opening three - part series , social historian dr @entity59 - herself the great - granddaughter of servants - explains that life for these people was much less ' cosy ' than is imagined in television period dramas			1
the way we were : a @entity69 cook and @entity15 's cook @entity70 , played by @entity71			2
a century ago , 1.5 million @entity69 people worked as servants as a rule , most servants tended to work not in big stately homes full of fellow workers and camaraderie but as the lone member of staff in a middle class town house - and lives for these people was lonely , dark and damp , according to a new @entity28 documentary series			1
dr @entity59 reveals that her own ancestors never enjoyed their time as servants as much as those in @entity89 's @entity15 seem to			2
@entity28 thanks to the emergence of the new middle classes , the majority of household staff worked as the only servant in a home			0
and instead of partaking in a lively , jolly dinner after serving the family upstairs , these servants would live and eat alone in @entity9 's dark , damp , dirty basement kitchens			1
servants in grand houses fared little better			0
staff in stately homes were kept hidden from the ' polite ' eyes of their masters with complex mazes of hidden passages throughout the home , helpful when trying to enforce complete segregation			0
moreover , strict servant hierarchy even separated staff from each other			0
dr @entity59 explains that in 1901 one in four people were domestic servants , mostly women , and that these people were seldom seen as ' working - class heroes '			0
servants tended to work seven days a week , often from as early as 5am until as late as 10pm , for very little money			2
and , unlike the kind and empathetic @entity125 family of @entity15 , employers were unlikely to take pity on staff who were overworked , exhausted or ill - even if they were just children			0

life for servants in late @entity26 and early @entity9 was brutal
new staff were often given generic names such as @entity46 and @entity53
tasks *included* clipping your master 's toenails and ironing his shoelaces
maids would not be able to turn down a master 's *sexual* advances
over 1.5 million @entity69 people worked as servants
most of the @entity69 population would have been *downstairs* *...* not @entity173
