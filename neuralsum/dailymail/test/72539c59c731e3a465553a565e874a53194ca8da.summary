by @entity0 for @entity1 a brother and sister who had n't seen each other for 16 years have been reunited after they were matched unwittingly on @entity5			1
@entity6 , 24 , and @entity7 , 22 , were separated back in 1999 after their parents ' messy break - up , after which their father took @entity6 and his twin brother @entity13 to @entity14 and their mother stayed with @entity7 in their native @entity16 , reports @entity17			1
despite @entity6 and @entity13 's best efforts to later track down their sister , it was only after @entity6 moved back to the @entity16 , joined @entity5 and swiped ' right ' on @entity7 's profile that they were reunited - but the penny did n't drop straight away			1
' the first time i swiped her profile i had absolutely no idea , ' @entity6 told @entity41			1
' in our first conversation i was actually flirting with her so the conversation was very superficial			0
' after messaging back and forth , details began to emerge about @entity7 that made @entity6 suspicious of who she might be - namely a girl from @entity50 , where he had grown up , who had been separated from her twin brothers			1
initially , @entity6 backed off over his concerns , but a few days later curiosity got the better of him so he asked @entity7 a series of further questions about her past			2
upon realising they were indeed siblings , the pair agreed to meet at a local café			2
' when i saw him , it was suddenly very clear , ' @entity7 told @entity17			2
' it was so special to see my own blood brother again after 16 years			0
' @entity6 was reunited with his long - lost sister after swiping right to her profile photo on @entity5 ( file photo ) @entity6 's twin @entity13 was equally as aghast			1
' it ’s too crazy for words that you come into contact with each other again like this , ' he told @entity74			0
' but that also makes it very special			0
i am very happy that i can now still get to know my sister			0
' the three siblings say they now plan to spend more time together , albeit in a more appropriate setting .			0

@entity6 and @entity7 lost contact after parents ' *divorce*
years later , @entity6 , 24 , swiped right on what was his sister 's @entity5 profile
