by @entity0 @entity1 has fuelled the debate over @entity4 ’s failure to follow team orders during sunday ’s @entity6 by saying his rival ’s behaviour was ‘ not good ’			1
@entity1 , the world championship leader , is not the most outspoken driver so his careful criticism of @entity4 is noteworthy			1
speaking as the debate over the rights and wrongs of the incident widened , @entity1 said : ‘ @entity4 did n’t let me by although he was ordered to , so that ’s obviously not good , and we need to discuss that internally			1
the @entity27 was asked three times by the @entity30 hierarchy to let his team - mate through			1
that was because @entity1 was on a different strategy that could , according to boss @entity34 , have allowed him to win			2
the message was passed on to @entity4 by his race engineer @entity36 , who was conveying the instruction coming from the technical director - cum - team principal @entity38			1
in similar circumstances last year — in @entity41 — it was @entity42 , then team principal , who told @entity1 to hold position			1
his voice came over the radio firmly , and @entity1 complied with the instruction even though it cost him third place			2
the incident on sunday highlights doubts as to whether @entity38 and @entity34 , who is meant to be in charge of the team ’s commercial wing but is their spokesman on most matters , are providing the right kind of leadership			2
@entity58 should have obeyed team orders - @entity1 i 'll drink to that : @entity4 believes he has what it takes to challenge for the title it is questionable whether @entity38 was even right to ask @entity4 to move , something he seemed to doubt himself given he did not go on the radio to issue the order and withdrew the instruction after the third attempt , undermining his authority in the process			1
@entity73 , @entity30 chairman , admitted they panicked into asking @entity4 to give way			1
@entity76 , a five - time grand prix winner , said : ‘ i do n’t see anyone at @entity30 with the authority , credibility and gravitas that @entity89 had			2
@entity42 emphatically said : “ no. hold position , ” in @entity41			0
it is not just what you say , it is the way you say it and it is the person who says it			0
‘ is @entity34 more interested in projecting himself ? does he really have the authority ? @entity38 is a fantastic guy , but he is not the person to deal with this			0
@entity73 is a very clever man , but i do n’t know what authority he has			0
if there was one person who could kick ass in that team , it is the person that they let go , @entity42			2
’ authority ? questions marks have been raised over the leadership of @entity30 ' @entity38 ( @entity102 ) and @entity34 blow : @entity1 was leading sunday 's @entity6 until the deployment of the safety car mercedes have said they will draw up new guidelines for the rest of the season ’s racing , which resumes in @entity111 on august 24			1
@entity4 , who trails @entity1 by 11 points , defended his behaviour , saying : ‘ it is not a matter of questioning authority			1
i am hired to race and bring in points			0
i am also hired to race my heart out			0
‘ it was just a case of not giving a single point away			0
i do n’t think i was being ruthless			0
i was not even being bloody minded			0
i did not cost @entity1 a win			2
i was racing against him			0
why would i be concerned for him ? ’			0

@entity4 *controversially* defied team orders in @entity19 race
the @entity27 did *n't* let title rival @entity1 through despite order from @entity30
@entity4 said he was ' very *shocked* ' with instruction from @entity30 pit wall
@entity1 still leads @entity4 in @entity30 championship ahead of summer break
