by @entity0 one of the richest @entity2 businessmen in @entity3 and boss of an £ 800 million hotel chain today won his @entity7 battle to deny his elderly father ’s claim to a share of his family wealth			1
@entity12 the 63 - year - old head of the @entity15 hotels group successfully defended his 87 - year - old father @entity16 ’s claim that under @entity19 tradition he was entitled to a third of the family wealth			1
father and son still live in the same seven - bedroom country house @entity25 near @entity26 , @entity27 , with their families			1
@entity16 , photographed alongside a carer in central @entity31 told the @entity7 his case was not about money but because his son @entity34 had abandoned his @entity19 traditions @entity12 ( above ) claimed that he did not have a particularly religious upbringing and disputed his father 's claim that he was entitled to a one - third share of the hotel empire despite living together in the same house , mr @entity16 sought a one - third share of the family business			1
the father who is suffering from ill health and gave his evidence from a hotel claimed that family property is covered by a constructive trust			2
his counsel @entity50 told the judge sir @entity52 : ' the father is not claiming a share of any of @entity34 ’s wealth acquired by his own efforts			1
it is our claim that @entity34 ’s wealth is the family ’s wealth			1
the only cash put into the family ’s empire is that put in by the father in the 70s			2
' @entity34 is said to be worth around £ 415 million			2
but the court claim was said to be worth about £ 50m			0
but the father has said the claim is not about the money but about tradition and his son ’s failure to abide by the ' @entity75 ' system from @entity19 and @entity77 traditions which implies a sharing of family wealth			1
mr @entity16 , pictured above with a carer , told a special sitting of the @entity7 that he his friends will be ' shocked ' that his son is claiming credit for the family 's success the judge was asked to decide as a preliminary issue , if the family property is subject to any constructive trust under @entity92 law , and if so what the terms of such a trust were			1
if he decided that such a trust was binding there would be another trial to decide how much is due , if agreement can not be reached			0
but in a long written judgment the judge on what he described as a ' most unusual ' case , dismissed the father ’s claim			2
he added : ' although i have rejected father ’s claim , it by no means follows that i regard him or mother as having in any way acted dishonestly in making it			0
on the contrary , they struck me as having advanced this claim in all good faith believing it to be well founded			0
' the root of the difference between them was in their upbringings with the father being raised in rural @entity122 and the mother in @entity124			0
but @entity34 completing his education in the @entity3 and taking “ little interest in the religious side of @entity128			0
' father and son turned a small family post office business in @entity132 , @entity31 back in 1973 into the multi million hotel group			1
his son helped in the business and after he qualified as an accountant they moved into hotels , buying a rundown b&b in @entity139 , @entity140 , which they refurbished and sold on at a profit			0
they gradually traded up and bought a string of upmarket hotels , building up a multi million pound group which includes the @entity146 and the @entity147 in central @entity31			0
but the father claimed his son forced him to retire in 2010 and now refuses to follow tradition by sharing the family wealth			1
the father lives at @entity25 with his 81 - year - old wife and @entity34 ’s mother @entity153 who is backing his claim			1
@entity34 also lives there with his wife @entity157 and their four children			2
in a witness statement in the court proceedings his father said : ' both i and his mother are deeply ashamed that @entity34 should publicly renounce his cultural heritage and the mutual rights and obligations in which he was brought up			2
' that family system based on custom and religious teaching is widely practised and universally understood by @entity77 and @entity19 in @entity122 today just as it was in @entity122 where i was brought up			2
' it is also widely practised and universally understood in the @entity19 and @entity77 communities overseas including @entity174 and the @entity3			0
' my life has been devoted to winning respect for myself and family in those communities and the respect which we have earned as a family has been the basis for the success of our business in this country			0
@entity34 and his wife @entity157 continue to live with his parents despite the dispute ' for @entity34 to deny that and claim all the credit and ownership for himself will be shocking to wide sections of those communities particularly our family friends - that is why his mother and i are so ashamed			1
' but @entity34 claimed in evidence that he did not have a particularly religious upbringing , that neither of his parents regarded the family to be living under an agreement to share property nor was there any such agreement			2
the judge commented : ' if nothing else this litigation has highlighted the extraordinary enterprise that has enabled the @entity16 family , in the space of just two generations , to rise from obscurity and very modest circumstances in what was then rural @entity122 , overcome all manner of difficulties , come eventually to this country and make a fortune for itself			1
' i dare say it is not untypical of many such families but there can be few whose rise has been quite so meteoric			0
the family ’s story as it unfolded in the course of this trial has a heroic quality to it			0
it has made it all the more painful to have to listen to the tragic differences that now divide its members			0
' the court was forced to travel to the @entity239 off @entity240 - which is owned by the family - to hear evidence from @entity16			1
he was considered too frail to travel to the @entity243 near @entity244			0
the @entity16 family said they would cover the costs of the special hearing so as not to cost the taxpayer any money			1
the court heard that @entity16 had grown up in rural @entity122 while his wife was from @entity124			0
his son @entity34 went to christian mission schools in @entity124 and completed his education in the @entity3			1
@entity12 photographed outside the @entity255 in the 1980s @entity12 trained as an accountant before starting his career in the hotel trade			0

father claims son forced him to retire in 2010 to deny him a share of the family 's £ 800 million hotel business
@entity16 said that under @entity19 tradition he was entitled to one - third of the family 's wealth
@entity7 told the @entity16 family started hotel empire from small post office business
judge describes the case as ' most unusual ' but praises the family for their ' extraordinary enterprise '
despite the case , mr @entity16 still lives in the same house as his son @entity34
