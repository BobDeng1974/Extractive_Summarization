painting a possible scenario mr @entity91 told a press conference that @entity47 was owed about $ 2,000 by mr @entity15 , and may have turned up at the house to collect his money			1
he imagined : ' a dispute arose over billing demands made on @entity15 by @entity124			2
discussions got heated in the past month , ' ' my scenario is @entity23 pulls into her driveway , @entity124 walks up demanding money , and an argument ensues			2

property : @entity15 was said to have a ' sex dungeon ' with whips and chains in the basement of the @entity139 bar and lounge ' from what we 've been told [ about the ] cause of @entity23 's death , it would seem that would be the type of thing that could happen between two people , ' @entity141 reported			1

@entity91 insisted reports of the alleged affair and s&m lifestyle were not relevant to theb case and could prejudice any future trial			1
' whether or not @entity15 has an alternative lifestyle , that does n't make him a criminal			0
