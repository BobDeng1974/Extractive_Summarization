by @entity0 need that little bit of extra motivation to hit the gym ? a new piece of research may get you running to your next yoga class			0
according to a new study , more and more women are experiencing exercise - induced orgasms			2
an ‘ exercise induced orgasm ’ ( @entity16 ) or ‘ coregasm ’ , as it is known by the leagues of gym - addicted fans on the internet , has gained both recognition amongst the fitness world and scientific backing			1
he writes : ' a recent study conducted by the @entity35 published in the journal @entity37 suggests that the most orgasm - inducing exercises are ' climbing poles or ropes , biking / spinning and weight lifting			1
anything that involves engaging your abs , basically			1
' and the most effective workout ? an exercise that works the abdominal muscles using a piece of gym equipment called the ' captain 's chair			0
' to perform the exercise you stand with your forearms resting on the padded armrests of the chair , which are positioned at right angles to the body			0
fitness fanatic : of the women who came clean in the study , 45 per cent held abdominal exercises responsible , 26.5 per cent weight lifting , 20 per cent yoga , 15.8 per cent cycling and 13.2 per cent running			1
fitness fan @entity68 better watch out ! you then squeeze your abdominal muscles ( which support the trunk of the body ) to help you lift your knees to your chest before lowering the feet to the floor again			0
effective : the most effective workout is an exercise that works the abdominal muscles using a piece of gym equipment called the ' captain 's chair ' of the women who came clean in the study , 45 per cent held abdominal exercises responsible , 26.5 per cent weight lifting , 20 per cent yoga , 15.8 per cent cycling and 13.2 per cent running			1
a lucky - and , one assumes , shockingly sensitive - 9.6 - per cent could even experience an orgasm by going for a brisk walk			1
and it seems that the trend is growing ; 40 per cent of respondents had experienced an @entity16 on more than 10 occasions			2
but the majority of women are n't enjoying these experiences in the gym perhaps as much as they may in the bedroom			0
a fifth of women who experienced them said they had no control over the experience and most of them felt self - conscious as a result			2
@entity104 , co-author of the study , said : ' these data are interesting because they suggest that orgasm is not necessarily a sexual event , and they may also teach us more about the bodily processes underlying women 's experiences of orgasm			0
' while @entity114 claims the mechanics of the coregasm are still to be confirmed , an earlier study - and a bit of common sense - offers a relatively simply explanation , writes @entity30			0
' exercise revs up the sympathetic nervous system and , for women who are already quite sensitive , an increased heart rate , constricted blood vessels , and elevated blood pressure might just be enough to tip them over the edge			0
' a study entitled @entity129 and @entity130 ( the clue is in the title ) was the first to suggest that the female orgasm could be a “ purely physiologic ” phenomenon			0
' this fits nicely with @entity114 ’s statement that “ most women reporting @entity16 said they were not fantasising sexually or thinking about anyone they were attracted to during their experiences ”			2
' take note ! a recent study suggests that the most orgasm - inducing exercises are ' climbing poles or ropes , biking / spinning and weight lifting			1
anything that involves engaging your abs , basically			1
