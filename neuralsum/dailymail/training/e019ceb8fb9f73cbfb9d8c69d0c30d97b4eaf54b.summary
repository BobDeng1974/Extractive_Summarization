by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 8 april 2013 psoriasis is an immune condition that causes patches of skin on the body to be covered with flaky scales			1
it affects two per cent of people in the @entity9 and though not infectious , it can be unsightly			2
for some , it ’s a minor irritation , for others it can seriously impact on their life			2
it is a chronic condition and difficult to shift			2
this week @entity0 , 47 , visits a clinic for treatment			1
fine floating : the salts and minerals in the @entity19 , pictured , help with skin conditions what ’s the problem ? i suffer from mild psoriasis on my elbows , ears and scalp			1
i ’ve had it since i was a child and though i ’ve tried countless ointments , the flaky patches have never gone away			2
once , when travelling in @entity32 , a man came up in the street and said he was sorry for my leprosy ! so it makes me feel self - conscious , especially in summer , when i ’m baring my arms or when i have my hair pinned up			2
what ’s the solution ? a spell in @entity42 at the @entity43 , at the @entity44 , 1,300ft below sea level ( the lowest point on earth ) , overlooking – you guessed it – the salts and mineral - rich @entity19			1
people visit from around the world in search of treatment for skin diseases , joint disorders and anti-stress therapy			1
what ’s the treatment ? the @entity19 area is rich in anti-inflammatory minerals			1
the air also has the highest oxygen content on earth and there are extremely low levels of harmful ultra-violet radiation , creating perfect conditions for solar therapy			0
all of which helps to accelerate the body ’s metabolic process and stimulate cell and tissue regeneration			0
complete package : it 's not just the water that has healing powers , the air by the @entity19 has the highest oxygen content on earth ( file photo ) clinic director , dermatologist dr @entity81 , says that though the causes of psoriasis are unknown , stress is thought to be a trigger			1
treatment depends on long exposure to the sun as well as dips in the @entity19			1
most patients stay for two weeks between may and november when the sun ’s rays are strongest			0
i ’m only here for three days , but hope to see some improvement			0
dr @entity81 recommends i soak in the @entity19 three times a day for 15 minutes , sit in the sun for short periods three times a day and drink three litres of water a day			1
he also prescribes a daily scalp massage – administered by the nurse – with a combination of salicylic acid , caster and olive oils			0
he prescribes salicylic acid and @entity108 for my ears and elbows , to apply every evening			0
i follow his advice and by the end of my stay , the psoriasis on my ears and scalp has disappeared ( though it is pretty stubborn on my elbows )			0
dr @entity81 says 30 per cent of patients leave completely healed and the rest experience long periods of symptom - free relief			0
