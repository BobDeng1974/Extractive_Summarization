a single market town in the foothills of the @entity3 has taken more asylum seekers than the whole of @entity6 , it has been revealed			1
@entity8 figures show @entity9 , which rose to prominence with its textile mills during the @entity12 , houses 680 refugees – one in 41 of all those in @entity14			1
yet the entire south - east region , which covers eight counties plus the @entity17 and is amongst the most affluent in the country , has received just 441 asylum seekers			1
it has a much larger proportion of people from a @entity31 background than the rest of the country			0
around 10 per cent of the town is @entity31 @entity14 , according to the latest census			2
the town is also poorer , with more unemployment and lower house prices than the @entity14 average			2
around 10 per cent of population is out of work – compared to just 6 per cent nationally			0
more than 5,000 families in @entity9 have children where neither parent is in work			0
the average house price in the town is just over £ 120,000 – less than half the £ 270,000 across the @entity14			2
in @entity47 , the local authority which covers prime minister @entity51 ’s @entity50 constituency , has failed to take a single person , while @entity53 , where home secretary @entity54 is the mp , has just one			0
now mps have vowed to raise the issue with the @entity58 amid concerns that some towns and cities across @entity14 have been handed an ‘ unfair ’ burden			2
they say the distribution of asylum seekers is a ‘ scandal ’ that has put disproportionate strain on schools , health services , housing and other infrastructure in their constituencies			1
@entity9 ’s @entity73 mp @entity72 – who has repeatedly urged party leader @entity74 to face up to the pressures of immigration faced by communities across the @entity14 – has said in the past his seat , population 211,000 , has become a ‘ magnet for the dispossessed ’			1
mr @entity72 said : ‘ i think we can be proud as a country that we offer asylum to people who need it , but we need to make sure the burden is spread fairly across the country			1
we need to make sure that the system is fair			0
‘ the system at the moment is a shambles and ministers need to explain why @entity51 ’s constituency takes no asylum seekers and a wildly disproportionate number are placed in @entity9			1
‘ this is bad policy and runs the risk of not only putting extra strain on community relations but also putting significant pressure on services that are already struggling due to @entity103 cuts			0
’ @entity9 is home to @entity105 , who famously confronted @entity106 during the 2010 election campaign over the numbers of immigrants in the town @entity9 is home to @entity105 , who famously confronted @entity106 during the 2010 election campaign over the numbers of immigrants in the town			2
the @entity73 leader later described her as a ' bigoted woman '			0
@entity73 mp @entity116 , who represents @entity117 , in south @entity118 , said the former coal and steel city had 426 asylum seekers			1
he said : ‘ many asylum seekers have settled very well and become part of @entity117 , and the city has been very hospitable			1
but the differences in the number being sent to different parts of the country is so amazing as to be scandalous			0
‘ there are serious problems such as the strain on health and education services and problems with people integrating			0
these tensions are not the fault of the asylum seekers , but the @entity58 for housing them disproportionately			1
@entity9 mp @entity72 said the town should be proud of the number of people it offers asylum to but stressed the must be ' spread fairly across the country ' ‘ we have been carrying more than our fair share			1
’ mr @entity116 is also angry that the @entity58 ‘ dumped ’ a notorious @entity148 gang leader in @entity117 on immigration bail when he had no links to the city			0
@entity58 figures show there were 27,815 asylum seekers living in @entity14 at the end of september			1
many are fleeing war , humanitarian disasters or political and religious persecution in other parts of the world			0
but large numbers turn out to be economic migrants , who arrive in the @entity14 to look for well - paid work compared to their home countries , then tried to claim asylum to win the right to stay here			2
@entity148 – which is not included in figures for the @entity6 – had 2,692 asylum seekers , ranging from 377 in deprived @entity170 , east @entity148 , to to just eight in leafy @entity171 - upon - @entity172 in south - west @entity148			1
@entity173 , which covers the constituency of @entity176 frontbencher @entity175 , sacked for apparently sneering at a house draped with @entity179 flags and with a white van parked in front , took 30 refugees			0
in the @entity184 , there were 6,298 asylum seekers , including 1,418 in @entity186 and 794 in @entity26			1
the @entity187 had 4,105 asylum seekers , including 1,370 in @entity189			2
@entity190 alone had 2,625 , @entity191 922 and @entity192 , with @entity193 , just down the road in @entity195 , taking in 666			0
but in the @entity6 , well - heeled @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 are among those local authorities without a single asylum seeker			0
sources in @entity203 suggested the high prices of rented property in the @entity6 and lack of available homes in rural areas meant it was more cost - effective to place asylum seekers outside the region			1
a @entity58 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity14 has a long and proud history of offering sanctuary to those who genuinely need it			0
‘ asylum seekers are housed according to their individual needs and where there is available and appropriate accommodation			2
agreements between national government and local authorities are voluntary and have been in place since 2000			0
‘ we review this regularly , working closely with local authorities to ensure the system is fair for asylum seekers and for tax payers across the country			1
