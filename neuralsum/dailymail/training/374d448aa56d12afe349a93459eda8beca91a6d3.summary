some of the schoolgirls abducted by militant group @entity3 may never return home , @entity1 's influential former president @entity0 said today			1
@entity0 said president @entity6 's administration had taken too long to respond to the april mass abduction			1
the warning from @entity0 , who stepped down in 2007 and nurtured @entity6 's own rise to power , will dismay parents who have now waited 60 days for any news of their daughters , taken from a school in the village of @entity15 in northeast @entity1			1
captured : @entity3 released this image of around 270 girls who were taken in april once @entity6 's mentor and one of his strongest political allies , @entity0 turned against him last december			1
‘ i believe that some of them will never return			0
we will still be hearing about them many years from now , ’ @entity0 told the @entity23 's @entity22 radio service on thursday , in comments echoed in an interview with @entity1 's @entity27 website			2
@entity0 's criticisms underline divisions within his and @entity6 's ruling @entity34 , heightened by the failure of the government and army to rescue the girls and by political jostling ahead of presidential elections due in 2015			1
‘ if you get all of them back , i will consider it a near - miracle ... ' do you think they ( @entity3 ) will hold all of them together up till now ? warning : former president @entity0 said president @entity6 's administration had taken too long to respond to the april mass abduction ' the logistics for them to do that , holding over 200 girls together , is too much , ’ @entity0 said , according to @entity27			1
‘ if the administration had acted quickly , we could have rescued them , ’ he said			0
@entity3 , which wants to set up an @entity56 caliphate in @entity58 's largest economy , has fought back against an army offensive and killed thousands in bomb and gun attacks , striking as far afield as the central city of @entity63 and the capital @entity65			0
‘ as these events get reported , it 's bringing far more publicity for their ( @entity3 's ) cause and it 's putting pressure on the @entity1 government , ’ @entity66 , a senior @entity58 analyst at research firm @entity67 , told @entity68			0
activists have staged regular street protests demanding that @entity6 step up efforts to free the girls			1
the president has also faced hostile media coverage and a vociferous global # @entity82 campaign			0
@entity3 leader @entity83 appears in a video where he showed some of the hundreds of schoolgirls his terror group abducted nearly two months ago @entity6 has traded accusations over the failure to crush @entity3 with the main opposition party , which runs local authorities in the northeastern regions at the heart of the five - year - old revolt			2
@entity0 , twice president and a powerful political godfather , has progressively fallen out with @entity6			1
in a letter leaked in december , he said any decision by @entity6 to seek a second term in the 2015 poll would be ‘ morally flawed ’			2
@entity6 has not confirmed he will run again , but campaign - style posters and banners bearing his image have sprung up around the capital			0
his assumed ambition to seek re-election is a thorny issue in religiously mixed @entity1 , where alternating the presidency between the majority @entity109 south and the mostly @entity111 north has been considered an unwritten rule			0
@entity6 , a southern @entity109 , was vice president and came to power when president @entity114 , a northern muslim , died in may 2010 , three years into his first term			2
underlining the growing pressure for more action on @entity3 , @entity1 's defence ministry said on thursday it was studying the military tactics used by @entity121 to crush the island nation 's rebel @entity122 .			0
