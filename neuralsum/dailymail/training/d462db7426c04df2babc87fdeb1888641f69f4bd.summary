by @entity0 an investment manager dying from @entity2 today called on the government to allow people with terminal illnesses to take experimental drugs			1
@entity7 , 55 , was diagnosed with the degenerative condition two years ago and although the likelihood of finding a cure for him is unlikely , he is volunteering to try new drugs so that others have a better chance of surviving in the future			1
mr @entity7 , who previously enjoyed skiing and flying but is now confined to a wheelchair , has began a campaign for better medical advances after discovering there has been only one drug licensed to treat @entity2 in the past 20 years			1
change : former statistician and investment manager @entity7 , pictured with his wife @entity23 , wants sufferers of rare diseases to be able to take unlicensed drugs there are currently an estimated 3.5million people in the @entity29 suffering from ' rare ' diseases that are considered uneconomic for research efforts by major drug companies			1
but mr @entity7 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , says the problem is made even worse by the bureaucracy that stops patients taking unlicensed drugs			1
professor @entity37 suffers from a type of @entity2 @entity2 ( @entity2 ) is a progressive illness that attacks the motor neurones , or nerves , in the brain and spinal cord			2
this means messages gradually stop reaching muscles , which leads to weakness and wasting			2
@entity2 can affect how people walk , talk , eat , drink and breathe			2
however , not all symptoms necessarily happen to everyone and it is unlikely they will all develop at the same time , or in any specific order			2
there is currently no cure for @entity2 and only one drug licensed to treat it - @entity57			1
it is available freely on the @entity59 and has been shown to have a modest impact on survival			0
@entity2 can affect any adult at any age but most people diagnosed with the disease are over the age of 40 , with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 50 and 70 men are affected approximately twice as often as women			0
about two people in every 100,000 will develop @entity2 each year			0
professor @entity37 is perhaps the most well - known sufferer of @entity2			0
the physicist was diagnosed in 1963 and has to communicate using a computer system which detects movement in his cheeks			0
because his nerves are continuing to deteriorate , the are fears that he will ultimately lose the ability to communicate completely , leaving his brain ' locked in ' to his body			0
source : the @entity85 speaking to the today programme on @entity88 he said he was prepared to take the risk of trialling an unlicensed drug : ' absolutely , and i think many other @entity2 patients would be			1
expert : @entity95 sir @entity94 said the current laws make it difficult for smaller companies to bring new drugs to the market ' obviously there are risks , but for most people in this situation they do a lot of research into the subject and they work in conjunction with their doctors and they are n't going to do anything too out of the ordinary			1
' i will be dead anytime between this afternoon and a few years off			0
i already ca n't move my arms and my legs and i have trouble breathing			0
before i had the condition , i would have agreed with them			0
but now my thinking is that there 's so much more we can do			0
' let 's try anything - what have we got to lose ? ' on average it takes £ 1 billion and 10 years to bring a new drug to market – something so prohibitive that more than 90 per cent of drugs do not make it through the system			1
sir @entity94 , an expert immunologist from @entity131 , agreed there is a need for a change in the law			0
he said on the today programme : ' the present drug regulations make it impossible for smaller drug companies to take drugs to the market			1
' it can only be done by larger pharmaceutical companies			1
' mr @entity7 has now launched a petition , which will be handed to the @entity145 , calling for experimental drugs to be available in return for to terminally ill patients giving up the right to sue if they experience side effects			1
he said : ' no new drug has been approved for @entity2 since @entity57 was approved 20 years ago			2
' for those with life threatening illnesses the risk - ratio of “ doing nothing ” is hugely significant and must be considered			0
people in this situation must be able to access all the information on a drug that they need - even if the risk of adverse effects or failure are great			2

investment manager @entity7 , 55 , calls for drug laws to be *reformed*
wants terminally ill to be able to try unlicensed drugs in return for giving up the right to sue pharmaceutical companies
argues bureaucracy prevents new drugs coming to the market
