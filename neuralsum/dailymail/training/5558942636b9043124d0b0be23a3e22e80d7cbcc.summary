flanker maggie ' @entity1 hopes to play a major role in @entity4 's bid for @entity6 glory			1
@entity4 play @entity7 on friday in @entity8 , @entity9 on august 5 before the duel with @entity11 on august 9			1
@entity12 has received numerous personal awards in her distinguished career , which has seen her claim seven successive @entity17 titles , six in @entity18 , but a @entity6 honour has proved elusive			1
ambitious : @entity12 is aiming for the trophy when @entity4 's women begin their @entity6 campaign @entity23 have won the last three tournaments by beating @entity4 in the final , something @entity4 will hope to put right on august 17 at @entity27 in @entity28			1
@entity12 , who is playing in her third @entity6 , said : ' i 've been very fortunate to have got the accolades that i have and all the recognition , which is brilliant			1
' but the real reason why i wanted to get into the sport and play for @entity4 was to be world champion			1
it would mean the world			2
' that 's one accolade i have n't got			2
that 's what i want for the team , as well as an individual thing			0
" i want people to recognise us as the best team in the world			2
' the hurt of 2010 has driven @entity12 and the other 11 survivors from the defeat in @entity49 on			1
' losing in that @entity6 was horrendous , ' added the flanker , who recalled a team meeting the following january when head coach @entity52 questioned whether his players were willing to commit to four more years			1
' to face it again and say ' right , do you want to commit to another four years to get that medal ? ' everyone said ' yes '			2
' i remember it well			0
it was a hard time , but if anything it 's been good for us the last four years because it 's kept us going			0
more to come : @entity12 , pictured here in action against @entity66 during the @entity17 , will be competing in her third @entity6 next month ' it 's like @entity69 gold			1
it 's one of the things that drives you to get up in the morning and work really hard and train hard			0
' @entity12 believes the @entity74 have got bigger and better every edition since 2002 and , coupled with sevens ' inclusion in the @entity69 , the sport is only getting better			1
she is not yet ready to think about playing at the @entity78 , with the @entity6 the full focus			1
' the priority right now is this @entity6 and doing really well , ' she added			1
' all i can think about at the moment is this and once august 17 rolls around , after that i can decide what i want to do			2
' i 've been to one @entity87 and it was absolutely amazing			0
' to go to an @entity69 would be anyone 's dream			0
who knows ? there 's a lot of good players coming through and i 'm not getting any younger			0
' history : @entity12 and @entity4 suffered defeat against @entity23 in the last @entity6 final prop @entity97 is the most - capped player in the squad with 91 appearances			1
' @entity100 is @entity101 and i got my first cap out in @entity11 where the @entity103 are			2
it 's quite apt really , ' @entity104 said			0
@entity104 hopes for ' third time lucky ' in 2014			0
' we were really close in 2010 and it could 've gone either way , ' she added			0
' that disappointment makes me even more hungry to win this one			0
i 've got four years more experience to take into it			0
' @entity104 is often compared to @entity114 for her longevity			0
she added : ' the first goal is to win the @entity6 , then the second goal will be to get 100 caps			2
when we come into next season and the @entity17 i 'll think about that			0

@entity4 face @entity7 in their opening @entity6 game
they also take on @entity9 and @entity11 in august
@entity12 will be competing in her third tournament
she says it would ' mean the world ' if @entity4 *emerged* *victorious*
