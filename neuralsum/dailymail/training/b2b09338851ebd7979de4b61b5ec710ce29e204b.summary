the young men in tangerine shirts trooped off @entity2 to a standing ovation as another bewildering week in the life of @entity5 reached its bizarre conclusion			1
days of anger and recrimination had ended in mystery and farce			2
for the most part , that pitifully small but enthusiastic crowd was applauding perfect strangers			2
even the most ardent home fan could not have named more than a handful of @entity5 ’s unlikely heroes			1
a summer of bitterness and confusion had left @entity5 with a grievously depleted first - team squad			1
at one stage last week , the club employed just eight fully fledged professional footballers			1
a tour of @entity24 had been cancelled , just a single pre-season friendly had been played and there was real doubt they would be able to field a side for saturday ’s match with @entity31			1
discontent : @entity5 fans vent their anger at chairman @entity35 before the game with @entity31 @entity37 out : @entity5 fans want @entity35 out of the club after a disastrous few years for the club the club ’s owner , @entity35 , had attracted even more than his usual ration of anger and contempt in these parts			1
rumours and accusations were running wild and the entire dark pantomime was expressed in the pre-match message on the public address			2
‘ the @entity53 team will be — @entity54 : @entity55 ... @entity56 : @entity55 ... ’ and so on			2
a few old favourites had survived the summer but several of the new men had arrived under conditions of anonymity			2
this phenomenon was seen at its most vivid in the second half , when the substitutes started to arrive			2
again , the announcer could not enlighten the small assembly			2
the outcome was that 2,389 patrons now believe their new players are , respectively : @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and 16 and last , but by no means least , @entity72 , who came on with eight minutes left			1
many a club would infuriate their fans with such cavalier treatment but at @entity5 they just chuckled			1
‘ where are they finding them ? ’ , asked one lady in the @entity78			2
‘ do you think we ’re actually paying all these people ? ’ her husband snorted cynically : ‘ not if @entity35 has got anything to do with it			1
’ in truth , the most savage reaction against @entity88 and his father , the former chairman @entity89 , had been vented outside the ground before the match			2
a crowd of about 120 gathered with banners and flags chanting : ‘ get out of our club , get out of our club , two greedy b * * * * * * s , get out of our club ! ’ the @entity101 have heard far worse over the years and the fans ’ advice is unlikely to be obeyed			1
and not all the supporters are as antagonistic			2
but the abject failure of @entity5 ’s owners to build upon their single , immensely lucrative season in the @entity108 is the chief cause of the bitterness			1
the season of 2010 - 11 was their year in the sun. indeed , for one , bright , shining moment , they sat at the summit of the @entity117 game after beating @entity118 4 - 0 in the opening match			0
but despite occasionally delighting with their attacking football , they survived for only that season			0
their financial reward amounted to some £ 40million plus substantial ‘ parachute payments ’ , the last of which is almost due			0
they have a fine , modern ground and , it is said , many millions in the bank			0
but investment in the team has been negligible			0
the bookmakers have made @entity5 favourites for relegation at 8 - 13 on			1
hard work ahead : @entity137 has a huge task ahead of him at @entity5 this season who are you : @entity141 was one of the trialists who come on for @entity5 against @entity31 and yet saturday , against a side who are preparing for their own shot at the top division , @entity5 played with spirit , a surprising degree of organisation and the vaguely desperate air generated by pros in search of a contract			1
by contrast , @entity31 were rather less than ordinary			0
although their own pre-season preparations have been infinitely more serene than @entity5 ’s , they swiftly ran short of ideas and enterprise			1
they will improve , of course , but after taking 68 minutes to score the only goal of the game against the team with no names — @entity165 striking a volley with casual authority — a hefty degree of improvement will be essential			0
@entity171 , chairman of the @entity172 ’ @entity170 , takes the view that the @entity101 are going nowhere and so the fans will have to work with them			1
@entity176 take a quite different view			0
‘ @entity37 is clearly to blame for the chaos at the moment , ’ said @entity171			0
‘ with so few players signed and ready , he has to be			2
he ’s the most hated man in @entity5 and possibly with good reason			1
but he has things in his favour			0
he refuses to deal with agents , which takes some principles , even if it sometimes seems a bit naive			0
and he has put money into the ground , to set alongside the money the family has supposed to have taken out			0
so there ’s a balance to be struck			0
’ according to @entity171 , the club made £ 40m from that @entity108 season , plus the parachute payments			1
‘ we do n’t have high expectations , ’ he said			0
‘ there are more important things than football in @entity5			1
there are areas of real deprivation round here			0
but still we take the club seriously			2
‘ look , the training ground is not fit for purpose			0
we ’ve battled relegation for two seasons running			0
and all this is the result of bad management by @entity35 , basically			1
’ and this from a man regarded as a moderate by the @entity5 followers			1
rise high : @entity216 has penned a permanent deal at @entity5 after two previous loan spells new beginnings : @entity220 will be looking to get his career back on track at @entity5 naturally , it would have been helpful to hear from @entity35 himself but he was not only unavailable for comment , he also banned the @entity227 newspapers from the press box			1
and @entity35 was not alone in his pique			1
his new manager @entity137 refused to comment after the game			0
he is said to be on unfriendly terms with his employer			0
he had no notes in the programme and the dwindling band of fans have no notion of what he is thinking			2
such is the way of things at @entity2			0
yet some things never change in this rackety old town			0
when the storm was done , @entity5 landmarks emerged from the driving rain in all their gaudy glory ; @entity248 and @entity249 and @entity251 ’s @entity250			1
i remembered the old chap shuffling away from the @entity78 when the storm was brewing			0
he zipped his wet - top to his neck			0
‘ they reckon it ’s in for four days , is this , ’ he remarked			0
‘ still , it ’s good for the garden , eh ? ’ that ’s the thing about @entity5 fans , they like to see the bright side in the darkest situations			1
it is a gift which will be sorely needed for the new season .			0

@entity5 fans were *protesting* against owner @entity35 on saturday
there are only 13 players contracted to the club currently
just four years ago the @entity275 were preparing for the @entity108
