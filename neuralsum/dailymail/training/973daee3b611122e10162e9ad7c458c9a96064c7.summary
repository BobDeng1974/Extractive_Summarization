by @entity1 reporter published : 04:10 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 9 october 2013 restraint : @entity4 writer @entity3 , pictured , said show bosses could have shot a more graphic rape scene than the one which was aired on sunday @entity3 has defended the airing of a rape scene in this week 's episode of @entity4			1
answering criticism that rape scene had been sensationalist , the @entity13 - winning writer said he supported @entity17 's decision to screen the sex attack of a maid by a visiting valet			1
in the episode , aired on sunday night , @entity22 's character , @entity21 , was attacked by mr @entity24 , played by @entity26 actor @entity25			1
it sparked more than 200 complaints to @entity17 and @entity29 with many saying it was too strong for a sunday night			1
however , mr @entity3 said the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic			1
he told the @entity35 : ' the whole point of the way we do things on @entity4 is we do n't do them gratuitously			0
we are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people			0
' if we 'd have wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out			1
' the point of our handling is not that we 're interested in sensationalising but we 're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional damage			0
' @entity52 has also defended the storyline , saying she is ' proud ' of @entity4 for tackling the controversial subject			1
the star said it was a ' brave ' move by programme - makers to feature such a difficult scene in the normally gentile sunday night series			1
@entity17 warned viewers about upsetting scenes before the start of the period drama , but it still received ' around 60 complaints ' by monday			2
' brave move ' : @entity52 has defended @entity4 after the rape storyline that featured on sunday night 's show caused complaints from shocked viewer @entity22 said during an interview on @entity72 's breakfast on tuesday : ' i was really proud of the show for tackling a subject like this			1
it 's a really brave thing to do and i really do believe that @entity3 's written that in a way that is not gratuitous at all , he does very much go on to explore the emotional journey of @entity21 and @entity80			2
' he 's done a beautiful job of hitting the right note with it			2
i think we all just felt a big responsibility to get it right			0
' @entity22 , who was made aware of the storyline by producer @entity87 a week before she was given the script , said creators of the show did not want to show graphic violence on screen			2
research : the actress said she looked as testimonies from women who had been in similar situations to prepare herself ahead of shooting the rape scene she said : ' @entity3 , and this is a credit to him , was adamant that we would n't depict that kind of violence against a woman on the screen and that 's something that he did n't want in a show of his , that he 's a part of , and that 's an incredible thing in this industry in this day and age			1
' and the shock value was there without having to depict anything graphic			2
the story is shocking enough , as it should be for a story of that essence			0
' she said she had prepared for the role by looking at the testimonies of women who had been through a similar ordeal in those days - as well as modern women who had been reluctant to report attacks			2
disturbing : despite a warning from @entity17 , many viewers were left stunned by the violent scenes of @entity52 's @entity21 being raped by mr @entity24 in advance : @entity22 was made aware of the storyline by producer @entity87 a week before she was given the script ' i did a lot of research on the internet reading through people 's stories of women who have been through similar situations , and women that had n't gone to the police in this day and age because they were in a situation that came across as being vague when they were going to explain it - maybe they were at party or it was someone they knew and they were very confused by what had happened to them			1
defense : @entity25 also defended the show as he appeared on this morning on monday ' now what i wanted to do - i wanted to get into my head as an actress - was to bring that to this time period			0
' she said the programme 's historical advisor had pointed out that women still had few rights back then which made them reluctant to report such an attack			0
' all you had was your reputation , your career , possibly if you had a job , and your family			0
there was still such a stigma attached to any sort of attack like this , that you were very much in danger of losing all of that			0
' if a woman lost her reputation , that would bring shame upon the house - she could lose her job , she could lose her husband and society still saw it as no smoke without fire - " he 's only a man , he could n't help himself "			1
it 's very interesting to see that was only a hundred years ago , ' @entity22 added			0
@entity22 's comments come after @entity25 , who plays mr @entity24 in the show , also defended the storyline			0
he said on @entity191 on monday : ' for a show like @entity4 it really leaps out as a bold and risky idea			0
' the episode was seen by an average audience of 9.2 million according to overnight figures .			0
