judge @entity73 , who extended @entity3 ’s original sentence , said he had never ‘ encountered a defendant who has so recklessly and wantonly and flagrantly and criminally acted in as destructive and ( as ) manipulative a fashion as @entity3 has ’			1
but mr @entity71 called the additional five years ‘ shockingly long ’ and said it ‘ may be the harshest sentence ever imposed on a federal prisoner for a drug possession offence ’			2

in the court papers , it emerged that @entity3 – who had roles in four minor films – began using intravenous cocaine at the age of 20			0
he swiftly moved on to heroin and , by the time he was 25 , ‘ his life revolved around [ the drug ] ’ , mr @entity71 said			0
his friends were fellow users who gravitated to him because of his access to family money , which supported their habits , the lawyer said			0
he added that @entity3 ’s ‘ exasperated ’ father cut off his son ’s allowance when he refused to go into rehab , forcing @entity3 to turn to drug dealing to pay for his habit			2
mr @entity71 argued that the judge had gone too far with @entity3 , punishing an addict for something beyond his control			2
‘ while we recognise that many of the words that the district court used to describe @entity3 ’s conduct – “ reckless ” , “ manipulative ” , “ destructive ” – were apt , the simple truth is that @entity3 is a heroin addict who has yet to shake his habit , ’ he said			0
his 68 - year - old father has previously said he had a strained relationship for many years with his own father , @entity173 , and acknowledged that he may have repeated that pattern with @entity175			1
