by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 09:21 est , 17 may 2013 @entity2 's @entity1 is seeking to redress the balance of men and women over 50 in prominent roles in tv			1
their research has found that just five per cent of the presenters on our screens are women aged 50 plus , as ' older women fall into a black hole in broadcasting ' and are ' airbrushed ' from our screens when they age			1
@entity17 , 69 , for one , has complained that is all down to ageism and sexism and that women should not be ' shown the door ' as soon as they have a grey hair or wrinkle when the same does n't apply to men			1
but one female commentator is far from sympathetic			0
freelance journalist @entity32 said these women who now have ' sour grapes ' about their lack of opportunities on telly only have themselves to blame			1
too late to complain : @entity32 , left , said women like @entity17 , right , should have spoken out about sexism in tv in their youth writing today in @entity36 , she says they should have thought about their career longevity in their youth - when they instead were happy to trade on their looks in order to get ahead of ' plainer ' women			1
she said : ' the problems did n't start when on - screen women got older ; they started when they were 25 and perfectly happy to muscle past their plainer - @entity47 colleagues by primping and preening themselves into what passes for contemporary beauty : big eyes , glossed lips , defined breasts , dieted hips			1
' she said that women such as @entity57 and @entity58 ' tacitly colluded ' with the tv tradition that women were not there to ' present the news but to decorate it			2
' and so they should n't be surprised that their greying hair and wrinkled skins means this is no longer a possibility			0
' thinking man 's crumpet ' : @entity57 , left , and @entity58 should n't have traded on their looks when they were younger ' they sold their souls to the @entity73 decades ago and now comes playback , ' as @entity32 puts it			1
she adds that women like ms @entity17 should not resent the men like @entity78 and @entity79 who are still on tv in their twilight years			0
she said it 's ' irrelevant ' that these men now look like ' dinosaurs ' because they were never hired for their looks in the first place			0
@entity85 deputy leader @entity84 wants the lack of older women on tv to be readdressed			2
women take note : older men like @entity78 remain on tv because they were hired for their knowledge , not their appearance she said : ' it is not that women are n’t there			1
it is that they get to a certain age , then they find they are near the exit and they get pushed out the door			0
' miss @entity2 previously raised the issue of ageism in tv in parliament in 2009 when @entity108 , 66 , was sacked from the panel of @entity110 in favour of @entity112 , 30			0
' i think it 's absolutely shocking that @entity108 is not going to be a judge on @entity110			0
and as equality minister , i am suspicious that there is age discrimination there , ' she said at the time			0
figures released by @entity84 's commission this week reveal that the @entity122 employs just 25 women aged over 50 out of 413 regular presenters			1
pushed out : @entity108 , left , was replaced with a younger model on @entity110 , while @entity126 said she would ' collapse in shock ' if she was offered a mainstream presenting job this is better than @entity132 and @entity133 , who do not employ any older women presenters at all , and @entity136 , which has only one			2
former @entity139 presenter @entity138 , 56 , who won a landmark ageism case against the @entity122 in 2011 , said the latest figures were ' shocking '			0
meanwhile , @entity126 , 72 , told the @entity142 that the figures did n't come as a surprise to her as she would ' collapse in shock ' if she was offered another mainstream presenting job			0
she said older women were only given ' token ' roles			2
but ms @entity32 believes rather than bemoaning the system , change has to come from women themselves			2
she said today 's generation of presenters should consider their long - term careers when they are younger and rely on their knowledge , not their appearance , to get ahead			1
she explained : ' as the men have proved , start as you mean to go on and you go on longer			0

just 5 *%* of the presenters on our screens are women aged 50 plus
out - of - work older female presenters *cry* sexism and ageism
but @entity32 says it 's their own fault they *'re* no longer in demand
they should have traded on knowledge , not appearance , in their youth
instead they ' preened ' themselves to ' decorate ' the news
