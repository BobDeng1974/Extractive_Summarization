@entity0 have sacked coach @entity1 after a terrible start to their @entity4 qualifying campaign that has seen them earn just two points from four matches			1
the poor run culminated in sunday 's 3 - 0 defeat by @entity11 , leaving their chances of reaching the 24 - nation tournament hanging by a thread			1
' the @entity0 football association ( @entity16 ) thanks @entity17 for the historic achievement of qualifying for the @entity20 and it will never be forgotten , ' said the governing body 's general secretary @entity21			0
@entity0 have sacked coach @entity1 after a terrible start to their @entity4 qualifiers @entity1 was criticised for his tactics and team selection in @entity0 's group stage exit from the june 12 - july 13 tournament in @entity30 and came under more pressure after a shock 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity34 in their @entity36 opener			1
the 59 - year old former international forward , who scored 21 goals in 54 appearances for communist @entity40 , was granted a stay of execution after draws with @entity43 and @entity44 but the @entity11 rout proved to be the final straw			0
bitter after the @entity16 executive board unanimously relieved him of his duties , @entity1 said he was convinced @entity0 would have stood a better chance of reaching the @entity52 finals if he had stayed in charge			2
' i wo n't feel accountable if we do n't qualify because the prospect of winning five of the six remaining matches and clinching a berth should be realistic , ' he told @entity0 media			0
@entity1 said he will take some time off from football before taking ' one of the offers that have come my way ' ' i hope the football association made the right decision while i will take a short break and then accept one of the offers that have come my way in the past few months			0
' asked if he regretted not stepping down after the @entity20 , @entity1 said : ' no. i wanted to take the national team to @entity4 after reaching the @entity20 but the football association 's faith evaporated after the @entity34 defeat			2
' having taken over in 2009 , @entity1 suffered a pair of successive playoff defeats by @entity77 , in 2010 @entity20 and @entity79 qualifying , before the @entity81 nation hailed him as hero when they secured a @entity20 berth			0
but falling out with top scorer @entity85 in a 2 - 0 friendly defeat by @entity87 in march seemed to be a turning point as @entity0 failed to reproduce their qualifying form at the @entity20 finals and then made a woeful start in @entity4 qualifying .			1

@entity0 and @entity95 were *beaten* 3 - 0 by @entity11 on sunday
coach @entity1 sacked *due* to team 's poor form
they have picked up just two points from four @entity4 qualifiers
