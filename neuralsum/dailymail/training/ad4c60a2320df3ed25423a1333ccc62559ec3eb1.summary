during a recent visit to @entity55 , @entity3 spent time with @entity42 who said that he was ' working hard , i 'm saving up money and paying back my school loans '			2
the next day , @entity42 said that he was also saving up for a ring for @entity10 and @entity3 gave him his blessing , but he still made him wait a few days before formally giving him the go - ahead			1
since graduating from @entity63 in 2012 and putting her modelling days behind her , @entity10 has led a fairly private life			2

a way with animals : @entity10 , seen here with her father and their dog @entity96 , is training to be a veterinarian and had a run in with an infected cat bite earlier this summer that sent her to the hospital proud dad : @entity3 previously got in trouble for joking during his 2010 acceptance speech that both of his daughters were single , but that is no longer the case the clearest indication that he is trying to boost his national profile is by attending the @entity112 this past weekend with his wife @entity13			1
