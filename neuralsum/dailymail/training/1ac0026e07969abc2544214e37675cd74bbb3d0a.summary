@entity1 manager @entity0 has faith his players can compete against @entity4 on the pitch irrespective of what gameplan @entity6 employs			1
in their last two visits to @entity13 the @entity10 boss has comfortably won the tactical battle and @entity0 has lost all three encounters against his former mentor since taking over on @entity17			1
however , he insists that will not have an effect ahead of tuesday 's @entity19 semi-final first leg at home against the current @entity23 leaders			1
@entity1 boss @entity0 says he has faith in his squad to beat @entity4 in their @entity19 semi-final ' i think a big part is down to the players			1
once they cross the line it is about them and the confidence and the qualities they have , ' said the @entity38 boss			0
' he is a top - class manager , @entity6 has proven that over the last decade or so			0
' he has great experience but once the players cross the line for me i have a big trust in the group and they are working well at the moment			0
' for us it is certainly not a threat , it is an opportunity to reach a final			0
' despite almost winning the league last season @entity0 , in his third campaign in charge , knows he will have to start delivering silverware soon as the club 's last trophy came in this competitions under @entity59 in 2012			1
@entity1 could welcome back captain @entity60 ( centre ) for tuesday 's semi-final against @entity4 it would represent a significant hurdle overcome for the manager but he sees it as even more important for his young squad			1
he was a youth team manager at @entity4 during @entity6 's first spell in charge and @entity0 believes winning the @entity19 , the @entity69 's first trophy in @entity70 , provided a platform for a decade of success			1
' our objective is to win a trophy and qualify for the @entity76 , ' said the @entity38 boss			0
' i think winning a trophy would help our future here in what we are trying to build and trying to deliver			0
' it will give the younger players a lot of experience			0
@entity60 ( right ) came off at half - time due to injury in the @entity38 ' 1 - 0 win at @entity89 on january 10 ' i joined @entity4 in 2004 and at that point in their history they were a club who wanted to win titles and trophies			2
' they have maybe done it in a different way but over the last 10 years they have shown once you have won that first one you can hopefully go on and sustain it			2
' the players back then , some of whom are still there now , will tell you the first one is the most important			0
' we know it is going to be a challenge but we know if you want to win the competition you have to beat the best teams and at this moment in time @entity4 are the best in the country			2
' usually it has been @entity4 who have played things tight and capitalised on the counter-attack but ironically , @entity0 may find he has to rein in his side 's attacking intent in order to ensure they are not taken apart as easily as they were for @entity6 's last two visits			1
@entity1 last won the @entity19 in 2012 , under former boss and @entity13 hero @entity59 ( centre ) in a two - legged semi-final the last things he wants is for his side to have to go to @entity10 next week and chase the game from the off			1
' it is a different type of game , you do n't want to open up too much , but the tie is not won or lost in that first game so it is important we retain our confidence , ' he said			2
' you will have to deal with pressure at moments in the game but the most important thing coming out of this game is to make sure you are in a good position going into the second leg			0
' the last six games they 've won two , drawn two and lost two so we will look at it as an opportunity at home			2
' but if we do n't win the game it is not all lost , we can still go to @entity10 and win that 's for sure			0
' @entity155 ( right ) was on target as @entity1 won 2 - 0 at @entity157 in the @entity23 on saturday			1
