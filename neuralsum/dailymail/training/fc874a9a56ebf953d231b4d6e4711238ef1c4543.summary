posting a photo of the food you ’re about to eat on @entity8 has become a daily ritual for many			1
often this ‘ food porn ’ is n’t as appealing to those looking at it , but scientists are now claiming taking a photo of your food before you eat it makes it taste better			1

researchers at @entity31 ’s @entity30 claim taking a photo puts you in the moment and in doing so , heightens your senses			1
the person taking the photo will , on some level , feel the difference creating an incentive to continue the practice			1
the study from @entity41 found that looking at too many pictures of food can make it less enjoyable to eat , and can even put people off eating it in the future			1
this is because looking at pictures of what is on a plate can make a person bored with their meal before they 've even taken a bite @entity57 , the professor of excellence in @entity59 at the @entity30 , wondered about the power of rituals after noticing the funny routines that people often perform before eating and drinking			0
‘ whenever i order an espresso , i take a sugar packet and shake it , open the packet and pour a teeny bit of sugar in , and then taste , ’ she said			1
‘ it 's never enough sugar , so i then pour about half of the packet in			0
the thing is , this is n't a functional ritual , i should just skip right to pouring in half the packet			2
’ @entity57 and colleagues conducted four experiments to investigate how these kinds of ritualistic behaviour influences taste			2
in the first experiment , some participants were asked to eat a piece of chocolate following a detailed set of instructions : ‘ without unwrapping the chocolate bar , break it in half			0
unwrap half of the bar and eat it			0
then , unwrap the other half and eat it			0
’ researchers at @entity31 revealed that a longer delay between ritual and consumption of food improves taste the other participants were simply instructed to relax for a short amount of time and then eat the chocolate bar however they wanted			1
the results showed that those who had performed the ritual rated the chocolate more highly , savoured it more , and were willing to pay more for the chocolate than the other group			2
a second experiment reinforced these findings , showing that random movements do n't produce a more enjoyable eating experience			0
the data also revealed that a longer delay between ritual and consumption bolstered these effects , even with a neutral food like carrots			1
half the participants saw pictures of sweet foods , while the other half saw salty foods			0
after rating each picture based on how appetising it looked , everyone was given peanuts			0
participants then rated how much they enjoyed eating the peanuts			0
the people who looked at salty foods enjoyed the peanuts less in the final two studies , the researchers showed that personal involvement in the ritual is paramount - watching someone else methodically mix lemonade does n't make it taste any better			1
additionally , they found that ‘ intrinsic interest ’ - the fact that rituals draw people into what they are doing - accounted for the positive effects that rituals have on our eating experiences			0
while these rituals may seem small or mundane , the researchers note that the effects they produce are quite tangible			0
and while rituals are common before mealtimes , they could play a role in other situations , too			2
‘ we are thinking of getting patients to perform rituals before a surgery and then measuring their pain post-operatively and how fast they heal , ’ @entity57 said .			2

@entity164 scientists claim posting photos of food on @entity8 improves its taste
taking a photo means you are in the moment and this heightens your senses
this is true for any ritual and could work in other situations such as surgery
