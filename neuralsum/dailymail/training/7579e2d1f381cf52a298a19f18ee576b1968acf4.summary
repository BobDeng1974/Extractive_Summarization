@entity8 suffers from a rare type of brittle bone disease which has seen her suffer from over 200 broken bones since she was born			1
she was admitted to @entity12 for surgery to have metal rods inserted to make her limbs stronger , but her furious parents say they were ‘ horrified ’ to learn five of her teeth had also been taken out			1
@entity8 , six , who has brittle bone disease , was admitted to @entity12 to have rods inserted into her legs to make them stronger			1
her parents claim doctors also removed five of her teeth @entity12 says the teeth were loose baby teeth which needed to be removed as they ‘ posed a serious risk to @entity8 ’s airway ’ during surgery , and that her parents spoke to a clinician beforehand about all the care she may need			1
however , @entity8 ’s parents , @entity32 and @entity33 , dispute this and the hospital is now carrying out an internal review			1
mr @entity32 , 37 , said : ‘ after the surgery i was outside the hospital when my partner rang me in a very erratic state , crying and screaming			2
‘ at that point i thought @entity8 had died			2
i ran down to the recovery room where i first got a glimpse of @entity8 with a mouth full of blood			0
‘ they did n’t mention at any point that her teeth might be taken out - it was n’t even on the operation consent form			0
‘ the hospital is adamant that baby teeth were taken			1
but two of them were adult teeth , i know because i have the baby teeth at home			2
her parents , @entity32 and @entity33 , claim that two of the teeth that were taken out were adult teeth and say that they have contacted the police about the situation ‘ we feel mortified and let down			1
’ @entity8 was born with osteogenesis imperfect – a congenital brittle bone condition - and suffered 30 rib fractures in the womb			1
doctors initially gave her just two days to live but she defied expectations to survive			0
mr @entity32 , and his partner @entity33 , moved from @entity69 to @entity70 to be closer to bone specialists at the children ’s hospital but they ’re now planning to move her to another hospital			1
mr @entity32 said the family were told a dentist would examine @entity8 ’s teeth , but not that any would be removed			1
he also said the teeth taken were not loose			0
@entity12 ( pictured ) says that the teeth were milk teeth and that they were removed because they were loose and posed a serious risk to @entity8 's airway while she was under anaesthetic he said : ‘ she is n’t going back there again			1
‘ @entity8 has been going mad about the missing teeth			2
she keeps putting her tongue up there saying “ they stole my teeth ”			0
‘ it ’s not the fact her teeth were removed			0
she has a gastro tube and it ’s been difficult trying to get her to feed , now this will set us back			0
’ a spokesman for @entity96 said they had been ‘ made aware of an alleged incident ’ at the hospital			0
police are to be kept informed during the hospital review but are not investigating			0
the hospital says that it is carrying out an internal review but that no staff members have been disciplined a spokesman for @entity106 , said : ‘ the care given to this patient was done in her best interests			0
‘ she has a complex condition and had come in for a surgical orthopaedic procedure , during which five baby teeth needed to be removed while she was under general anaesthetic			1
‘ they were very loose and were judged to pose a serious risk to her airway			2
no harm was caused to her by the removal of these baby teeth			2
‘ her parents spoke to a clinician before any surgery was carried out and the care their child may have needed while undergoing surgery was discussed			0
‘ as an issue has now been raised by her parents , we will review this as we do with any concern			0
‘ no action has been taken against any members of staff			0
‘ we understand her parents have raised this as an issue with the police and we will keep them updated as we would with any incident			0
