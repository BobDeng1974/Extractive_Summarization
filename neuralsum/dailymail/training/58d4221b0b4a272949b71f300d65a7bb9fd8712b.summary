centuries of change by @entity1 people can get by without laptops but not without buttons , introduced in the 1330s , which transformed the way people looked , from loose hanging garments to tight - fitting ones this original and fascinating book sets out to discover which of the ten centuries from 1000 to 2000 saw the most change in the human condition			1
surely , most of us would say , it can only be the 20th century ? flying , mass motoring , space travel , advanced weapons , atomic power , telephones , radio and television , computers and @entity28 — what more change do you want ? ah , says the historian @entity1 , history is not just a matter of inventions			1
more important are changes in the conditions under which we live and , above all , in the ideas that are ruling at any one time			1
many crucial inventions are ones we take for granted			1
people can get by without laptops but not without buttons , introduced in the 1330s , which transformed the way people looked , from loose hanging garments to tight - fitting ones			1
the moon landing was a giant step for mankind but it did not affect daily life as much as the invention of glass mirrors around 1500			2
for the first time they enabled you to see what you looked like			1
people could see themselves as individuals , not just units in a group			1
it led to a demand for painted portraits , self - portraits , autobiography and general self - consciousness			2
think of how life indoors was transformed in the 1500s with the coming of efficient chimneys to take the smoke out and glass windows to let the light in ( but not the cold )			2
or the coming of gas light in the streets in the 1820s and soon afterwards in the home with the boon of a gas cooker instead of the coal - fired range from 1834			0
electric light bulbs ( 1870 ) led to all kind of electrically powered appliances — kettles , toasters , fans and sewing machines by the end of the 19th century			2
and the @entity91 unveiled the flushing lavatory which soon led to dedicated bathrooms for the well - to - do			0
public clocks on towers ( from about 1400 ) became domestic in late 1600s — @entity96 was very proud of his — but you had to wait till the 19th century to tell the time by your wrist watch			1
@entity101 discovered the @entity102 in 1492 but @entity104 ’s existence made little difference to life for the average @entity107 except for the novelty of potatoes , tomatoes and tobacco			0
most people would say the 20th century saw the most advancement with the rise of new technologies tea , coffee and chocolate did not appear till the 17th century , along with @entity120 gin , @entity122 brandy , champagne and humble lemonade			1
knowledge of the world was greatly expanded by the explorers of the 16th century , including @entity128 the circumnavigator			2
but amazing new worlds were opened up by @entity131 and @entity132 , who invented the telescope and microscope from 1610			0
even more mind - changing was not the discovery of what the surface of the moon actually looked like — which turned out to be bare and boring — but the photograph taken by an astronaut from moon orbit of the shining , blue and white @entity145 rising out of black space			2
@entity1 calls it ‘ probably the most important photograph ever taken ’			1
nothing so vividly brought home to earthlings how small , how vulnerable and how exceptional among heavenly bodies our planet is			0
it is a planetary ride which @entity1 offers us in his tour of ten centuries			1
it is exhilarating to time - travel with him , free of the complexities of dynasties , wars and politics that normally clutter up history			1
the 11th century , for example , can be summarised as a century of building castles			2
after @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , found conquering @entity171 a pushover — towns had no walled defences			0
he promptly built the @entity174 and his followers on their newly acquired lands followed suit			0
the 14th century was devastated by the @entity178			2
as it sped across @entity107 it turned into the most traumatic event in history up to that time — and perhaps ever since the moon landing was a giant step for mankind but it did not affect daily life as much as the invention of glass mirrors around 1500 the 14th century was devastated by the @entity178			1
as it sped across @entity107 it turned into the most traumatic event in history up to that time — and perhaps ever since			1
sweeping over @entity171 in 1348 - 9 , it killed 45 per cent of the population in seven months — to kill the equivalent number now you would have to drop two atom bombs ( of @entity197 size ) every day for seven months			0
the plague was to recur in the 1360s and 70s and about every ten years for three more centuries			0
in 1563 , it cost @entity203 20 per cent of its population			0
yet society did not collapse			0
one consequence was a general pay rise for labourers because they were now so scarce			0
the 18th - century @entity210 elevated reason over superstition , putting paid to the savage persecution and hanging of so - called witches			2
@entity216 and @entity217 persuaded men to think of themselves as free and equal , leading to @entity219 and the @entity220 , both much aided by the new newspapers dispensing free speech and free thought			0
@entity1 debates whether people ’s thinking was most changed by @entity226 or by @entity227			1
he opts for @entity227 for introducing the dream of a classless , equal society — the kernel of socialism the 19th century probably produced the most inventions that changed lives through the industrial and transport revolutions , using steam power			1
the population of @entity171 soared faster than anywhere else in @entity107			0
people flocked to the cities looking for work			2
‘ @entity242 sucked the life out of rural @entity171 and the railways were the straws by which they did it , ’ writes @entity1 memorably			1
reform bills increased the voting population but even after the third , in 1888 , the electorate was only five million out of a population of 22 million			0
they were all men , of course			0
the serfdom of women began to be lifted when they were allowed to keep their own property when married			0
but men were still free to beat their wives or even to sell them at country fair auctions			0
@entity1 debates whether people ’s thinking was most changed by @entity226 or by @entity227			1
he opts for @entity227 for introducing the dream of a classless , equal society — the kernel of socialism			0
so which century brought the most change ? that depends on the field of change that you reckon most important			1
the 16th and 19th century probably caused more radical change in ordinary people ’s lives by increasing how much food , heat and shelter was available			1
as a result the population grew far more than in other centuries			0
but the 20th century brought the biggest increase in life expectancy and personal wealth ( gdp per head ) , sexual equality and crime reduction			1
does the rise of liberal democracy as the goal of most western societies mean that we have reached stability and the ‘ end of history ’ ? no , answers @entity1 , because our present prosperity is unsustainable			1
the @entity145 ’s limited resources are being exhausted ever faster by ever - increasing numbers of humans			0
in a sombre last chapter on ‘ why it matters ’ , he predicts the future , beginning in this very century of declining civilisation as supplies of oil , gas , water and land begin to be @entity311 we manage to reduce consumption to sustainable levels , the future will be one of anarchy — the war of the rich holding on to what they ’ve got against the poor who will get ever poorer			2
the outlook , he says , is fearsome			0
can we believe in human progress ? if we do , it may not be for much longer .			0

people can get by without laptops but not buttons , introduced in the 1330s
they transformed the way people looked , from loose clothes to tight ones
most people would say the 20th century saw the most advancement
@entity1 says history is not just a matter of inventions
more important are changes in the conditions under which we live
and , above all , in the ideas that are ruling at any one time
