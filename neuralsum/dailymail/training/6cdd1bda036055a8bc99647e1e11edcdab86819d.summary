' @entity3 , who last week spent time with former @entity44 star @entity21 , has dramatically increased the provocation his father was known for , with multiple tests of nuclear weapons and missiles			0
yet @entity21 , who went to @entity0 with the @entity50 and an @entity52 camera crew , described the dictator as ' awesome ' and lavished praised on him			0
speculation has been growing that the wife of @entity0 ’s leader @entity3 has given birth since she was pictured looking significantly slimmer at the end of 2012			2
photographs seen on @entity0 tv show @entity25 wearing a neatly - fitting two - piece skirt suit in contrast to the loose - fitting clothing she was seen wearing in mid december and which suggested she was heavily pregnant			0

‘ the bulging stomach has gone down – has @entity25 given birth ? ’ asked one newspaper , the @entity70			2
the caption in another @entity39 paper , the @entity75 , read : ‘ @entity25 with her tummy reduced in 11 days			1
has she come out right after childbirth ? ’ @entity80 : this screen grab taken from @entity82 today shows @entity0 's young leader @entity3 , right , and his wife @entity25 , left			1

a @entity39 government official , quoted by the national @entity108 news agency concluded that @entity25 ‘ appeared to have already given birth based on analysis of the tv images			1
’ defectors from @entity0 are also said to have provided new details of @entity25 , who is considered a future power player in the @entity9 leadership hierarchy and a growing influence on @entity3			1
' @entity25 is a fresh face who is clearly stepping out but it ’s much too early to say if her public activity will have any political relevance in @entity0 , ' said a @entity125 official who did not answer questions about the birth			2

birth : speculation is growing that the wife of @entity0 's leader @entity3 , left , has given birth in recent weeks , continuing the family dynasty into a fourth generation			2
@entity25 is pictured right with her husband earlier this year couple : @entity0 leader @entity3 walks arm in arm with his wife @entity25 while attending a ceremony earlier this year @entity25 is said to have come from an ‘ ordinary family ’ – although her father being an academic and her mother a doctor raises them above the average level			1
the young wife of @entity0 ’s leader made her first public appearance in two months in october - bringing to an end what might have been a period of ‘ home detention ’ for being too carefree			0
@entity25 had been photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual manner when accompanying her husband			2
but then she disappeared from view , provoking speculation that she might be pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image promoted by her husband ’s late father , @entity140			0
analysts say that despite the young @entity3 ’s appointment as supreme commander of the nation , he is still under the control of the military hierarchy who make sure he presents a rigid , authoritative image to the rest of the world			0
that means that his wife must remain aloof and untouchable in the eyes of the masses , say @entity0 experts .			0

but @entity9 ' did not admit to the child because it is a girl '
@entity39 said to have confirmed the birth last week
