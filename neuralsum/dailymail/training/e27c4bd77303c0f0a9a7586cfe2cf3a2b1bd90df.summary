@entity1 president @entity0 arrived back in the @entity2 in defiant mood on tuesday and told the @entity4 it had ' made a big mistake ' in disqualifying him from owning the club			1
@entity0 was holding talks in @entity8 with the club 's former owner @entity9 - the investment bank still control 25 per cent of the club 's shares - when the @entity4 announced on monday the @entity15 had failed its ' owners and directors ' test '			1
the league told @entity0 he must stand down after finally receiving further evidence of dishonesty from the @entity15 judge who convicted him for tax evasion in march			1
@entity0 ( centre ) watches @entity1 play @entity26 at @entity27 back in september it was all quiet outside @entity29 on monday as the statements were released @entity32 actor @entity31 ( centre ) poses with @entity0 's daughter @entity34 at @entity29 on saturday the 58 - year - old will be entitled to return to his position at the club on march 18 next year when the conviction is spent under @entity2 law			1
the league has said @entity0 had 14 days to lodge an appeal			2
' i do n't want to spend a lot of money on lawyers , ' @entity0 told @entity46			2
' this club in the last five years has spent more money on lawyers than players			0
' when asked to confirm he will appeal , @entity0 said : ' sure			2
i 'm going to meet my lawyers			0
they ( @entity4 ) have made a big mistake			2
' they 're just throwing money from the window			0
' @entity0 took control of @entity1 in april when his family company , @entity58 , bought 75 per cent of the club 's shares from @entity9			1
the former @entity62 owner announced a new £ 20million investment in @entity1 on saturday and said he had successfully negotiated a £ 5million contribution from @entity9 after meeting with the investment bank 's officials in @entity8			1
the statue of former @entity1 captain @entity68 stands proud outside the famous old ground @entity1 ' players celebrate @entity72 's strike in the 2 - 1 win over league leaders @entity75 on saturday we have today received a notice from the @entity4 disqualifying mr @entity0 from being a director of @entity1 until march 18 2015			1
the club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision			0
in the interim , the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the @entity4 ’s @entity88 in april 2014			2
the steps that the @entity4 wishes the club to take – to remove mr @entity0 only to re-appoint him in three months ’ time - will be destabilising for the club , its supporters and sponsors and can not be in the best interests of any party			1
@entity0 added : ' i solved a big problem ( on monday ) in @entity8			1
it was important for the survival of this club			0
this club now is financially strong , it looks to the future and we 're going to present the facts			0
' we 're going to fix the club and the league is going to realise it 's doing a big mistake			0
' the league initially attempted to block @entity0 's takeover of @entity1 after his tax conviction in april , but the @entity15 successfully appealed			1
but the judge who over-ruled the league 's decision , @entity115 , said if it was later concluded that @entity0 had acted dishonestly when failing to pay import duty on his yacht , he would fail the ' owners ' and directors ' test '			1
@entity0 faces a second similar charge of tax evasion on another yacht			2
the latest court case in @entity126 was adjourned in late october and it is understood a new date has yet to be confirmed			0
the league has also asked an independent disciplinary commission to consider whether @entity130 breached league regulations by not disclosing information it had obtained from the sardinian court which convicted him in march			0
@entity136 understands there is no time limit on the commission 's findings as this further breach of its rules is an entirely separate process			0
it is also understood that @entity58 could install a new management structure at @entity29 to satisfy the league that @entity0 has no financial or executive influence on the club during his disqualification period			2
the board of directors of @entity4 has , once again , considered the position of @entity1 president , @entity0 , under its owners ' and @entity154			1
previously ( march 2014 ) , the @entity150 had ruled that mr @entity0 was subject to a disqualifying condition after he was found guilty of an offence under @entity15 tax legislation relating to the non-payment of import duties on a boat ( which resulted in him being fined € 600,000 )			1
in april 2014 , this decision was successfully appealed by mr @entity0 at a hearing of the @entity88 ( @entity88 ) chaired by an independent @entity163 ( sitting alone )			2
in reaching his verdict , @entity115 concluded that : “ mr @entity0 has satisfied me that on the facts before me , what he was convicted of was not conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest			2
” before going on to state that : “ if the reasoned ruling of the court in @entity62 discloses that the conduct of mr @entity0 was such that it would reasonably be considered to be dishonest , he would become subject to a @entity172			0
” @entity130 watches @entity1 take on @entity174 back in march before his takeover had been completed at its meeting last week , the @entity150 considered the reasoned judgment of the @entity178 against mr @entity0 , having successfully applied to the @entity15 courts for its full disclosure			1
the @entity150 considered detailed legal advice and agreed unanimously ( with the exception of its chief executive , @entity183 , who did not take part in the debate or vote having declared an interest * ) that mr @entity0 is subject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the @entity189			0
mr @entity0 is entitled to appeal the @entity150 's decision to the @entity88 within 14 days			0
as the judgment of the @entity178 has not been published in @entity15 , @entity4 will not make any of its contents public			1
additionally , the @entity150 concluded that it was appropriate to ask an independent @entity194 ( @entity194 ) to consider whether mr @entity0 and / or @entity1 breached @entity4 regulations relating to the timely disclosure of relevant information			1
the matter will be heard by an @entity194 in due course			0
editors notes : * @entity183 was chief executive and a director of @entity1 between 2004 and 2013			0
