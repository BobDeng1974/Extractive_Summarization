@entity1 owner @entity0 will be forced to sell his controlling stake in the club if an @entity5 judge rules that his recent tax evasion conviction was an act of ' dishonesty '			1
@entity10 chief executive @entity9 said the long wait for the full written judgment on @entity0 's conviction for failing to pay tax on his yacht was ' a cloud still hanging over the @entity10 and the club and mr @entity0 himself '			1
@entity0 was found guilty of tax evasion in march but following an appeal was allowed to complete his takeover at @entity22 because the @entity5 court had not confirmed whether it felt the offence had been a ' dishonest act '			1
@entity26 could be forced to sell @entity1 if @entity5 judge rules his tax evasion to be ' dishonest ' the @entity5 judge in the initial case will confirm this in her full written report , which had been expected in june			1
@entity33 had no option but to allow @entity35 to complete his takeover in april , but @entity9 , former chief executive at @entity1 , said the @entity5 could yet fail its owners ' and directors ' test			1
' it 's exceptionally disappointing that we have n't actually had the judgment , if only to draw a line under the whole scenario so that everyone knows where they are , ' @entity9 told the @entity48			2
' it 's a cloud still hanging over the @entity10 and the club and mr @entity0 himself			1
' the actual single arbiter in the matter ( the @entity10 ) made it very clear that when the written reasons are issued as part of the judicial process , if it is clear in there that the act was one of dishonesty , which is the test that we apply , then at that stage he would fail the owners ' and directors ' test and as such would n't be able to be a director of the football club or exert any control			2
both @entity71 and @entity72 have said they would like to be manager of @entity1 ' he is under an obligation to divest himself of his shares at that stage			0
' from our perspective he then fails the owners ' and directors ' test and at that stage the provisions are in the rules that he has to divest himself of his interests			0
' we 'd obviously give the club a reasonable period of time to organise its affairs because you would n't want to put the future of the club at risk immediately that you had a decision			0
' it 's a matter the @entity10 board would have to consider at that particular time			0
' the publication of the @entity5 judgment has been repeatedly delayed and @entity9 added : ' we are constantly monitoring it			2
' we have been asked to be kept informed			0
our influence over the judicial system in @entity5 is somewhat limited			0
' we have @entity5 lawyers monitoring it for us and we 've been told it will come out when it comes out			0
that 's how the @entity5 judicial system has been described to us			0
' @entity10 boss @entity9 described the case as a ' cloud ' hanging over the club and its owner			1
