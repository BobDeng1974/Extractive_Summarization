by @entity0 - parkinson published : 03:09 est , 13 june 2012 updated : 04:44 est , 13 june 2012 a retired police officer who investigated the scene of a baby snatched by a dingo has said he still has doubts about the case , despite the child 's mother being acquitted of murder and a coroner 's ruling in her favour			1
@entity13 went to @entity14 the night nine - week - old @entity15 disappeared but he says there must have been some human intervention			1
speaking about the result of the fourth inquest he said : ' if you go to court enough times , you are bound to get a win sooner or later			1
there were emotional scenes yesterday when the verdict was delivered			2
@entity32 ’s mother @entity25 , now 64 , tearfully embraced her former husband @entity28 and other family members in the courtroom			2
today she gave a rare interview today in the northern city of @entity54 where @entity55 , the @entity56 coroner , ruled in her favour saying she was ' satisfied that the evidence is sufficiently adequate , clear , cogent and exact and that the evidence excludes all other reasonable possibilities ' than that the baby was taken by one or more dingoes			1
@entity25 and @entity15 pictured shortly before her disappearance in 1980 she said she is writing a book about forgiveness and welcomed approaches from people who doubted her including one of the jurors who convicted her of murder			1
mrs @entity25 told @entity71 : ' i think they have a huge amount of courage to admit that they were wrong			0
' there are still people saying " i do n't care what the evidence was			0
i 've made up my mind and i do n't want to listen to sense "			0
' mrs @entity25 was convicted in 1982 when it was believed she slit @entity32 's throat with a pair of nail scissors			2
she was given a life sentence for murder but served just three years in a @entity54 prison before being exonerated and the case was depicted in the 1988 film @entity90			1
in the 32 years since she cried out in the night ‘ a dingo ’s got my baby ! ’ , there have been four inquests and a government inquiry into nine - week - old @entity32 ’s death			1
one piece of evidence that continues to fuel doubt is the fact that her baby - grow was found in relatively good condition near a dingo lair in 1986			1
the coroner said would have been ' very difficult ' for the animal to have removed it , but added that it was possible			2
many @entity36 had doubts about mrs @entity25 and her then husband , @entity28 , when they saw their cool demeanour on tv shortly after the tragedy			0
speaking about that she said there was nothing they could have done to change people 's minds			0
' it would n't have mattered what we did			0
if we did n't react exactly the same as the individual watching us reacted , that individual thought we were being weird			0
beauty spot : @entity32 was snatched from her tent at a campsite near @entity14			1
her clothing was later found beside a dingo 's lair trial : @entity25 and @entity133 leave a courthouse in @entity135 , @entity36 in february 1982			1
she was originally jailed for murdering @entity15 while he was given a suspended sentence ' so if you smile , that 's dreadful ; you should be crying			1
and if you do n't smile you 're hard - hearted			0
and if you cry all the time , you 're a drama queen , ' she added			0
she said @entity141 was surprised that her sense of humour did not match her public persona when the pair met before the actress played @entity25 in ' @entity90			0
' @entity141 said : ' i thought i had it all down pat , your role , but you 've just blown me out of the water in 10 minutes , ' @entity25 told @entity152			0
mrs @entity25 was released in 1986 after @entity154 @entity153 fell to his death while climbing @entity14 – known today by its @entity157 name of @entity14 – and landed beside a matinee jacket that was vital to her defence			2
she had told police that no dingo saliva had been found on @entity32 ’s jumpsuit because the baby was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit , but no jacket was found at the time the child disappeared			1
ordeal : mrs @entity25 served six years for her murder before being acquitted in 1988			1
she had always claimed that a dingo killed their child			2
a third inquest in 1995 could not determine the cause of death			0
mr @entity133 , who was convicted of being an accessory after the fact of murder but later exonerated , then fought a long legal battle for a fourth inquest			1
that inquest heard new evidence of dingo attacks , including three fatal attacks on children since the third inquest			2
mrs @entity25 , who has two sons and a daughter who was born shortly after she started her prison term , has been spat at and abused by members of the public over the years			0
outside court , she said she was ‘ relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga ’ and that the verdict was ‘ such a vindication ’ for her and her former husband			2
she wept when asked what she thought her @entity32 might be like if she had lived – the day before would have been her 32nd birthday			0
@entity25 and @entity133 react to the ruling			0

officer who went to the scene and examined family 's tent said : ' if you go to court enough times , you are bound to get a win sooner or later . '
@entity212 served three years of life sentence for murder after baby disappeared
@entity217 had been camping at @entity14 in 1980 when tragedy struck
parents have always *maintained* that a wild dog snatched their child
body was never found despite *extensive* *searches* around @entity14
her clothing was later found beside a dingo 's lair at the base of the rock
coroner fought back tears while delivering verdict at fourth inquest
