an inquest in 2010 found that @entity11 , a father of two , was unlawfully killed			1
but the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , much to the anger of pc @entity0 's family , decided that no one should face criminal charges			1

he received a reprimand but will keep his job , the force said			1
another officer involved in the training exercise , ' @entity24 ' , has been required to resign			1
none of the policemen involved can be named publicly , after the inquest coroner and trial judge agreed with their lawyers that they should not be identified			0

@entity11 , from @entity32 , @entity33 , was shot as the firearms unit practised in a disused factory in @entity36 , @entity37 ( above ) on june 9 , 2008 he had brandished an unloaded handgun during the exercise while playing the role of a criminal fleeing in a car			1
the inquest jury at @entity52 in march 2010 ruled that there was a catalogue of failures not only by the officer who shot @entity11 but also in the planning , training and safety measures			1
the force pleaded guilty in july last year to breaching the @entity61 and was fined £ 166,666 plus £ 90,000 court costs			0
the policeman today forced to resign , @entity24 , was convicted of an offence under the same @entity65 last july and fined £ 2,000			2
a third officer , known as ' @entity67 ' , was acquitted of the same charge			0
misconduct allegations identified by an investigation by the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) were heard at an internal @entity3 misconduct hearing concluding today			2
the officer , who was not wearing body armour , was hit from a distance of about 12 inches by a blank round of specialist ammunition called round irritant personnel , which is not designed to kill but can be deadly at close range @entity11 's family said : ' it has taken an unprecedented six years for the officer who killed @entity0 to face any form of penalty for his actions but after hearing all the evidence , an independent internal discipline tribunal has found that this officer has not only breached several rules of conduct but his actions fell far below what is expected of a police officer			1
' we welcome the verdict but feel that this decision , together with the unlawful killing verdict reached by a jury at the coroner 's inquest in 2010 , confirms our opinion that the officer known as @entity19 should not have been allowed by the @entity14 to escape facing charges in a criminal trial			1
' the tribunal have considered the circumstances of this case carefully and administered what they believe to be appropriate sanctions but the important result of this hearing is that we finally feel the officers responsible have been shown indisputably that they are undeniably to blame for @entity0 's death and we want them to know that we believe if they 'd had the courage to face the consequences of their actions in 2008 and take responsibility for their actions , they could have saved our family six years of unnecessary pain and difficulty			2
' police and crime commissioner for @entity37 @entity126 said : ' i would once again pass on my sympathies to @entity0 's family , friends and colleagues			0
' i welcome the outcome of this disciplinary hearing , but again question why the @entity134 has taken six years to get to this stage			0
all this has done is prolong the heartbreak for @entity0 's family			0
it is insulting and it is unacceptable			0
policemen outside the disused factory in @entity36 , @entity37 where @entity11 died ' the @entity71 needs to change the way it goes about its business , or else the government needs to step in and put in place a regime which is fit for purpose			0
' @entity71 commissioner @entity149 said : ' the @entity71 investigation was concluded prior to the inquest into pc @entity0 's death in 2010 and the fact it has taken more than four years to reach this conclusion must have compounded the distress of pc @entity0 's family			2
' this training exercise was poorly planned and high risk			2
everyone involved will have to live with the fact that a popular and well - respected officer lost his life as a result of the mistakes made on that day			0
' chief constable sir @entity165 , who joined @entity3 after the incident , said : ' it is six years since @entity0 died , six years that @entity0 's family has had to wait for a conclusion to what has been a complicated and frustrating series of legal and multiple investigative processes which have caused additional delay in bringing this to a conclusion			2
@entity179 , the widow of pc @entity0 , speaking at @entity177 in @entity37 alongside her solicitor @entity176 ' this hearing was the final stage in a very long process and i hope that this decision provides @entity0 's family with some form of closure and that they can all now begin to move forward			0
' i would like to express my admiration for the dignity and resolve shown by @entity0 's family over the many years it has taken for the case to get to this point			0
' @entity0 was a complete professional , highly regarded by all his colleagues , who served the public of @entity37 with huge commitment and expertise			0
