@entity0 is laughing in the face of the accepted retirement age - currently 65 both in the @entity3 and the @entity4 - by aiming to become the leader of the @entity6 just months before her 70th birthday			1
if the former @entity4 secretary of state reaches her goal and is sworn in as the 44th @entity10 in january 2017 , then she will not only be the country 's first female president but also the second oldest , behind @entity12 , ever to open the doors to the @entity14			1
