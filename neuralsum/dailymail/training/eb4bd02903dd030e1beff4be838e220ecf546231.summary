the film , @entity9 , is about paramilitaries in @entity11 and is set in a @entity12 which is still marred by violence			1
starring @entity11 actor @entity14 the film is meant to the reality of modern @entity12			1
but film writers were horrified when they received the press pack full of unsavoury accessories leading @entity11 writer @entity20 , of @entity21 , to brand it ' the most distasteful freebie ever			1
' a @entity12 story : the film is set in modern day @entity12 which is shows as still marred by violence , pictured an attack by @entity30 groups in the @entity32 area of @entity12 in 2009 in evident dismay @entity20 tweeted that he had received ' a box containing a bag of nails ( for a nail bomb ) and a balaclava , for a @entity9			1
not quite sure what point whoever sent it is trying to make			0
but i 'm pretty sure it 's a moronic one			2
' the promotional boxes , which also feature fake newspaper clippings and surveillance photos , were sent to media outlets including @entity12 ’s @entity47			0
the plot of the film , follows @entity14 playing a weary detective tasked with investigating the murders of former paramilitaries			2
it was written and directed by @entity54 , a former engineering student at @entity55 , @entity12			1
@entity54 told the @entity56 that the purpose of the packs was not to frighten or offend people			1
in a conversation with the @entity56 @entity62 programme he said : ' the idea was to interest people in a movie we were making which is essentially the story of the two choices which face @entity12 , do we engage retribution or reconciliation			0
' obviously , the intention is not to offend anyone			0
we apologise if we did			0
' the intention is to raise awareness for something that we did , that delves into some legitimate questions and tells some interesting stories about the city and the country			0
' dark days : but the press packs containing nails , balaclavas and duct tape were too close to home for some including @entity21 reporter @entity86 split psyche @entity11 : the producers of the film say the pack was meant to represent the realist of modern @entity12 but whatever the justification for the stunt was many like mr @entity20 no seem inclined to give the film exploring ' a life after terrorism ' a miss. mr @entity20 remains unimpressed by the apology and told the @entity98 : ' i ’d like to sit down with whoever came up with that little brainwave and explain to them what growing up during @entity103 was like			1
' i ’m now not going to see it			0
there is such a thing as bad publicity			0
' @entity109 , a publicist for the movie , which opens next month , said the press kit had been sent out by the producers to represent the divisions that remain in @entity11 ’s psyche			1
he said : ' it was sent out to show the two sides of the film , reconciliation and retribution			2
' there are two sides to the box and one side represents retribution and violence and one side represents turning away from violence			0
it tries to show the dichotomy within @entity11			2
' the press kit appears to be the most ludicrous promotional movie stunt since a @entity134 cinema hired a gunman in full tactical gear to storm an @entity138 3 screening in may			2
terrified audience members called police , fearing they had stumbled into a repeat of the @entity143 cinema shooting which left 12 dead during a premiere screening of @entity145 last year .			0

director @entity54 claims the contents of the press pack was to *illustrate* the division in modern @entity11 *society*
but film *critics* were *enraged* and branded the stunt ' moronic ' and say they wo *n't* watch the film
