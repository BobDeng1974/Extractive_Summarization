former @entity1 spinner @entity0 has called on the @entity2 to realise their approach is ' out of date ' , saying that there is a ' stubbornness ' about their selection policy and that they are ' living in the past '			1
@entity0 watched on as @entity1 slumped to another heavy @entity12 loss , with @entity13 chasing down their 309 for six with ease , winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare			1
the defeat goes alongside reverses against @entity19 and @entity20 , with @entity21 the only team @entity1 have beaten so far			1
writing on @entity30 , he said : ' a positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is			1
' @entity0 also aired his views on @entity37 , adding that @entity1 had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score			1
' i think the problem lies not just with the bowling but the whole approach			2
it was a very self - congratulatory 310 , everyone was saying ' brilliant '			2
these days that 's about average and not a great score , ' he said			2
' we should be looking for 340 , 350 ; the difference between the top teams and everyone else is immense			2
they 're saying the is the limit when you bat , we 're still looking at par scores			2
' @entity0 feels the answer could lie with former @entity59 team - mate @entity58			1
' there 's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy , ' he added			1
' i like @entity65 , he 's a great lad , but i think even he 'd admit that he should n't be in the team at the minute , he 's in horrible form			1
' we have a lad in @entity58 , one of these new generation players who does go out and knock it about , he tries to smash everything for four and six			2
' we need to get these young lads playing			2
we have too many people running it , too many people involved , too many plans and i think we 're just living in the past			0
' @entity81 bowler @entity80 dives to make a catch that sees @entity1 's @entity65 dismissed @entity83 ( front right ) leaves the field after losing his wicket to @entity80 during @entity1 's match with @entity13 @entity1 batsman @entity88 falls as he avoids a ball during the match against @entity13 in @entity91 @entity1 's @entity92 dives to try and stop the ball from crossing the boundary rope against @entity95 former @entity1 captain @entity96 added : ' we are watching a era of @entity12 where if you are predictable you will end up with a predictable outcome			1
' another @entity102 player , @entity101 , said the @entity1 team were not being realistic			1
@entity101 has long spoken his mind about the national team 's woes , and though he conceded to some positives , he sees plenty of work to be done			0
he told @entity37 5 live : ' i do think we could have got another 20 - odd runs , there was a period where we were just cantering around			0
we are not a force to be reckoned with at all			0
' the batting was quite good , but the bowling ? no , no , sorry			0
it was n't very challenging			0
' they 're not bad players , we do n't have a bad side at all			0
but we 're not firing on all cylinders in any department whatsoever			0
' the sad thing for me , even @entity126 , ( he gave ) a nice interview , lovely lad , but there 's no realism			0
they keep telling us ' we 'll take the positives , we did well , we did this '			0
' they are trying to tell us little things and we do n't see them			0
they think ex-players like us are just watching to criticise , we 're not , we want you to win			0
' but we can only tell you what we see and you keep losing			0
' opinions also reigned in from other nations , with @entity143 spinner @entity142 saying on @entity30 : ' @entity144 are averaging 80 with the ball you ca n't defend any total , also lacking fire power with bat			1
' @entity126 plays a shot for @entity1 while @entity13 wicket - keeper @entity151 stands on guard @entity1 captain @entity153 watches on after another disappointing display from his side			1
