the bond between a handler and their @entity2 can only be built over time			0
it 's a closeness that becomes intrinsic , with the dedication of the dog built not on money or benefit , but love			0
so having to say goodbye is always going to be heartbreaking			0
such was the sad situation faced by the @entity12 at @entity14 - @entity13 in @entity15 recently , when a beloved member of their unit , @entity17 , had to be euthanized for an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor			1
she had never had a handler before , and her partner with sgt. @entity27 , had never had his own dog			1
' @entity17 and @entity27 were an ideal team pairing , ' said tech. sgt. @entity37 , 802nd @entity12 kennel master			1
' their relationship is immense because this was their first experience as a @entity17 team			1
' @entity27 would spend all of his free time with his charge			1
' i 'm single and i do n't have immediate family here , so i 'd come on the weekends just to visit her and take her on runs , ' @entity27 said			1
' i could n't even tell you how much time we 've spent together			0
' together they participated in the @entity53 competition			0
however in january this year , trainers noticed something was wrong with @entity17 's left leg			1
sick : @entity17 had an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor and could not be operated on an initial check - up did n't show anything abnormal			1
however a follow - up evaluation detected a tumor			2
@entity17 's certification was subsequently canceled and she was taken in for treatment			0
the tumor was found to be pushing on a nerve and causing her pain			0
but due to the location , doctors were unable to operate , which would cause the cancer to spread to the rest of her body			2
' the news of @entity17 's declining health hit us hard ; this sort of news always does , ' tech. sgt. @entity37 said			2
' euthanasia of @entity83 is a last resort and we try to approach every option available before it comes to that , ' ' most of our dogs get adopted out or continue on with their service in a civilian police department			0
' final goodbye : military members line up and salute @entity17 as she is walked into a veterinary clinic to be put down by her partner , sgt. @entity27 on february 27 , all of those who had worked with @entity17 lined up outside the veterinary clinic			1
a police procession blared sirens that resonated throughout the base			2
the officers then saluted as @entity17 was lead into the facility to be put down			1
' these dogs are our brothers and sisters in arms as well , ' @entity37 added			0
while highly - emotional , no one seemed to be more affected than @entity110			2
' through all the training we 've done together and the long 12 to14 hour days ; it was just me and her , ' he said			0
' she 's my partner			0
