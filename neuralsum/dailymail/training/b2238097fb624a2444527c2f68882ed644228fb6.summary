by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 01:56 est , 18 april 2013 a stark warning that banks across the @entity3 need to reduce the size of their debts by an astonishing £ 1trillion was issued by the @entity6 today			2
it called on banks across @entity9 to reduce the reliance on emergency wholesale funds provided by central bank and to rebuild their balance sheet			1
the failure of @entity9 banks to reform is ‘ blocking economic recovery ’ and starving small and medium sized businesses of vital funds they need to survive			1
@entity6 official @entity22 was critical of banks in the eurozone which he said were too dependent whereas as the @entity25 and @entity26 moved speedily to reshape their banking systems post the financial crisis the @entity9 have been slow to act applying sticking plasters in the shape of emergency cash arrangements provided by the @entity32			1
@entity6 officials cited @entity26 as the one country where the reform of the banks was well advanced			1
it expressed concern , however , that stalled progress in restoring the health of the state controlled banks – @entity44 and @entity45 – is a drag on the recovery of the @entity26 economy			1
commenting on its @entity50 a top @entity6 official @entity22 said he detected ‘ blue skies ’ in the global financial system some five years after the financial crash			0
but while he gave the @entity25 , the @entity26 and @entity56 praise for tackling the issues he was critical of the eurozone for failing to deal with ‘ legacy ’ issues of the debt build up and strengthening the balance sheets of its banks			1
he accused banks in the eurozone of having become ‘ too dependent ’ on the wholesale funds some of which have been provided under guarantee by the @entity32			2
the @entity6 pressed the case for ‘ decisive ’ action in @entity9 if there was to be recovery and this included the establishment of a ‘ fully fledged banking union			1
’ ‘ we do not yet have healthy banks , ’ the @entity6 ’s top financial analyst said			2
the @entity6 expressed concern about the health of the state controlled banks @entity44 and @entity45 although eurozone leaders have pledged themselves to banking union precious little action has been taken as markets have calmed down			1
progress also has been halted by the upcoming @entity89 elections , the political stalemate in @entity91 and the worsening shape of the @entity94 economy			0
the @entity6 officials expressed strong fears that recovery among @entity9 ’s weakest economies , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , was being held up by the appalling state of the banking system			1
‘ credit is not flowing in the euro area periphery , ’ @entity22 said			0
the @entity6 also expressed concerns that even though the legacy issues of the ‘ great recession ’ had not yet even though legacy issues of the great recession have not fully been dealt with there are new crises on the horizon			0
@entity22 gave his support to the contentious @entity116 rescue package noting that it was important in bank crises , post the crash , that private holders of bank debts – in @entity116 ’s case the large depositors – paid a price as well as the taxpayers			0
he described the situation in @entity116 as being unique to that country			0
the @entity6 expressed concern that now that the banking crisis is all but over in the @entity25 , where it began with the sub-prime meltdown in 2007 - 2008 , that it was already returning to bad habits			0
companies and private equity firms were rushing to raise cheap debt for takeovers without making the proper checks or putting in the right safeguards			0
the @entity6 is worried that ‘ pension funds and insurance companies ’ are taking excessive risks			0
similarly , the money being printed in the @entity25 , @entity26 and other advances countries is ‘ spilling over into emerging markets ’ exposing fast growing economies to currency risks and rising debt			2
this has raised the prospect of volatile capital flows that in turn could lead to currency wars .			0

the failure of @entity9 banks to reform is ' blocking economic recovery '
@entity26 is the one country where the reform of the banks is well advanced
state banks @entity44 and @entity45 are a concern
