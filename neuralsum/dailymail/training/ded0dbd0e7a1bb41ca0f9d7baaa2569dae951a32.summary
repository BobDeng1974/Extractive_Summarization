by @entity1 reporter published : 12:34 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 12:50 est , 15 october 2012 nine months after @entity3 met fellow airman @entity4 while on duty in @entity6 , she was dead - apparently killed as their car crashed after a late - night drinking session			1
but detectives arriving on the scene thought something did n't look quite right - and questioned whether @entity3 was in fact already dead before the moment of impact			1
now , @entity16 has detailed the couple 's violent relationship , the troublesome investigation into her death and the eventual murder conviction against @entity4 - which was granted after he admitted strangling her while his wife secretly recorded him			1
her family has also revealed the heartbreaking moment they found out about her death - and how the life sentence for @entity4 will never be enough for taking @entity3 from them			1
she was pronounced dead at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43			2
' i know i could n't cry , ' her younger brother @entity44 told the @entity47 show			2
' like that night , i could n't			2
i was just in so much shock			0
like , there 's no way it 's actually happened			0
' the death came after @entity3 had enjoyed a successful career with the @entity54			1
she had signed up aged 20 , three years after her mother died of cancer and she fell in with a bad crowd			2
' she really needed the discipline , ' her father @entity58 said			0
' the part of being a part of something			0
' happier times : the couple met when they were both stationed in @entity6 as working for the @entity54 fun - loving : @entity4 , who maintains his innocence , said he remembers @entity3 as ' a free spirit ' and she immediately excelled as a technician at the @entity54 dental lab in @entity71 , her boss , master sgt. @entity73 , said			1
' she was one of our top performers and that 's how i looked at her , ' he said			0
' she loved what she did			0
i mean , she helped people out			0
she was easy to like and everybody liked her			0
' in february 2009 , @entity3 was deployed to @entity6 and assigned to non-combat security , and met an airman from southern @entity83 named @entity4			1
' she had so much energy			0
she was such a free spirit and amazing girl , ' @entity4 remembered in the program			1
' she was all smiles every time i talked to her			0
' as their relationship blossomed , @entity3 was stunned when she learned @entity4 was married - but he assured her it was solely for the separation pay and he was devoted to his new girlfriend			1
outstanding : colleagues said @entity3 , 22 , excelled in the forces and loved that she was helping other people kicked out : @entity4 was discharged because of discipline problems and they reunited in the @entity101 but he was kicked out of the forces due to his disciplinary problems and , when @entity3 returned to the @entity43 lab after four months of service , @entity4 was there to meet her			1
' it was all good for probably a month , ' her best friend @entity107 said			0
' and then @entity3 went from being this vibrant girl and this superstar airman to showing up to work late			1
just kinda pushing everybody out of her life			0
' @entity107 said it was at that time that she started to dislike her friend 's new boyfriend			2
the couple would break up and then get back together - and @entity4 became increasingly violent , she said			1
' he would do crazy things like park her car in the middle of a four lane in traffic with her in the passenger seat , take the keys out and run with her sitting there in the car , ' @entity107 recounted			2
then , during an argument outside @entity3 's home in october 2009 , he hit her and left her with bruises			1
she called the police and @entity4 spent a few days behind bars			1
three weeks later , after she had started playing with a girls ' football team , @entity4 said he wanted to see her again , and she relented			1
secrets : @entity3 found out that @entity4 was married - but he said it was a marriage of convenience evil : but when they returned to the @entity101 , he became violent and hit her , and they repeatedly broke up he joined her at a photo shoot for her football team , where the girls stripped naked but used each other 's body parts to maintain their modesty for the camera			1
investigators believe seeing @entity3 remove her top with other people in the room pushed @entity4 over the edge - and led to him killing her just hours later			1
drunk , they left the photo shoot after midnight - but an hour later , the car slammed into a parked vehicle on a dead - end street , alerting neighbours to call authorities			1
@entity3 was killed in the crash			1
detective @entity157 told 48 hours that @entity4 ' story that they had been falling asleep initially made sense , but something did n't look right - so they called in a homicide team			1
' they 're the ones telling me , " look , it was a car accident but it was n't so significant that she should be dead from it " , ' @entity157 said			2
a medical examiner found @entity3 had alcohol in her body , but only just over the legal limit			1
there were no drugs in her system			0
crash : a scene picture shows the wreckage after the crash on a dead - end road in november 2009 scene : @entity3 's head hit the windshield - but investigators said she would not have died from the impact			1
@entity4 ' wife later revealed she had recorded him admitting to strangling @entity3 in the car they also found that she did n't hit windshield that hard and had been left with no significant injuries of her organs , neck , spinal cord or brain			1
yet , strangely , she did have bruising around her temple and upper right cheek			0
in further signs that she could have been strangled , there were hemorrhages on her skin and around her eyes			2
but medical examiners came against an odd problem when trying to find if she had been strangled ; because of her anatomy , she was missing a piece of cartilage in her throat that is usually crushed if someone is strangled			2
so the manner of death was ruled as ' undetermined '			0
detectives were dedicated to finding out the truth about her death			0
despite his earlier protestations that his marriage to his wife , @entity218 , was nothing , @entity4 returned to her in @entity83			1
when detective @entity157 heard he had had a big fight with her , he gave her a call			0
interrogation : @entity4 told detectives he did not kill her but evidence , such as bruising on @entity3 's face and blood inside the vehicle that splattered before the crash , were against him with barely a prompt , @entity218 told him @entity4 had confessed to punching and strangling @entity3 and covering it up with the accident			1
as he confessed , @entity218 had pressed ' record ' on her mobile phone			0
' i look over at her and just took a shot in the dark where her head would be and bam ! ' he says on the recording			0
' i punched the girl with all my might			2
she felt like a f * * * ing house dropped on her			0
' he added that he held down his forearm against her neck to kill her			0
@entity4 was arrested but said he had not been telling the truth in the recording			1
he insisted his wife had started the conversation and he ' just agreed with her to get the conversation to end '			2
in august 2011 , the case went to court , where prosecutors said @entity3 had been driving , they swapped seats and he began punching her , before moving her back into the driver 's seat for the accident			2
they presented other evidence , including how 911 callers had seen the car erratically braking on the highway , suggesting times he had been hitting her			2
killer : speaking from prison , @entity4 told 48 hours that he believes his wife was bitter for his affair and was out to get him missed : @entity3 's father @entity58 said the conviction was no reason to celebrate - as he is still without his daughter there was also blood in the car that had not splattered as she hit the windshield			1
he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life without parole - and her family said they felt ' instant relief '			2
but mr @entity279 added : ' you know , you do n't wan na say , ' yeah ! ' and cheer because it does n't really change anything			0
i mean , my daughter 's not gon na come back			0
' @entity4 said he will appeal the conviction as his wife recorded him without her knowledge , which is illegal in their home state of @entity83			1
he added that she schemed against him out of revenge			0
' she thought we were gon na be together , ' he told 48 hours			0
' i fell in love with someone else			0
and broke her heart , tore her to pieces			0
sorry for breaking her heart , but i 'm not a murderer			0
' see below for video			0
