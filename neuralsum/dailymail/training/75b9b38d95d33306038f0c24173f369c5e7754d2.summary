deputy headteacher @entity1 had failed to notice smoke rising from the wheel arch as she pulled up at a set of traffic lights in @entity15			1
but luckily two passing male motorists spotted the danger and frantically banged on her windows and ordered her out the car			2
convinced she was about to be mugged , @entity1 made a dash from the vehicle only to realised her ‘ attackers ’ , @entity23 and @entity24 , were actually her saviours			2
she would now like to track them down			0
' if they had n’t have told me to get out i would have carried on driving and then who knows what might have happened , i do n’t want to think about it , ' the 29 - year - old said			1
' i was so frightened because they shouted so loud			0
' i just did n’t understand			0
if it was not for them i would have carried on driving			2
' mrs @entity1 had been driving father - in - law @entity0 , 62 , to @entity35 in @entity15 for a routine endoscopy when the drama unfolded			1
the pair had only been driving for a short while when the two men drew up next to them and began frantically screaming at them to get out the car			2
bemused @entity1 stared blankly at them trying to work out what to do before she instinctively pulled the car into the kerb as the men began to shout again			1
they frantically climbed out of the car and it was then that they spotted the smoke rising from the wheel arch and bonnet			0
' i was at the traffic lights and these two men started screaming at me to get out of the car , ' she said			1
' i stared at them and they told me to get out of the car now			0
i pulled the car in but i could n’t get my seatbelt off quick enough , i was just fumbling around			2
' when i did get out the car they told me to stand back			0
inferno : this is the deputy head 's car just after the men got her and her father in law out of it as it burst into flames ' then i saw the front of my car , the paint work was bubbling and the engine was going mad and making a noise			1
i do n’t know how i did n’t see it			0
relieved : mrs @entity1 ca n't believe she walked away from the incident and would like to thank the men who rescued her ' i was a mess when i spotted it though , i was crying and panicking and hyper - ventillating like a child does when they ’re crying so much , it was awful			1
' her father in - law added : ' i thought we were going to be mugged , it was only when we pulled up we saw the smoke			1
' the two men apologised afterwards for making @entity1 cry and once they had made sure she was safely in another car , out of the pouring rain , began directing traffic away until emergency services arrived			1
the cause of the blaze is unknown but the intense heat caused the road surface to melt			0
fire crews extinguished the blaze within 30 seconds and an ambulance crew treated @entity1 for shock			1
the 10 - year - old @entity105 is now in a scrap yard and @entity1 is not sure when she will buy her next car			1
' i just keep thinking about what would have happened if they had n’t have been there , i would have kept on driving and then i do n’t know , ' the deputy head said			2
' i ca n’t thank these two men enough , i ’ve managed to get one of their mobile numbers but they ’re not answering which is a shame			0
' they have restored my faith in human nature by stopping to help and then offering me a coat and to sit in their car so i could get out of the rain			0
' sadly , i do n’t know the full names of the other @entity123 , only that the girl was called @entity125 , but they were so helpful			0
i ca n’t thank them enough			0

@entity1 pulled up to some traffic lights and the two men started banging on the windows and telling her , and her father - in - law , to get out
seconds later the car was on fire and then exploded
' if they had n’t have told me to get out i would have carried on driving and then who knows what might have happened , ' she said
the two men then *sheltered* her from the rain and then directed traffic away from the blaze in @entity15
