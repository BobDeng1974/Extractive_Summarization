underwater archaeologists looking for buried treasures from an ancient shipwreck in @entity3 have completed their first ' spacewalk under the sea '			1
the high - tech ' @entity6 ' is being used to explore the @entity9 shipwreck , and has allowed them to dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions			1
it was on this location that the so - called @entity16 - a 2nd - century @entity18 device dubbed the world 's oldest computer - was discovered by sponge divers in 1900 off the remote @entity23 island			1
these objects are among the first finds since divers returned to the 2,200 - year - old wreck off the coast of @entity3 the @entity6 , built in @entity35 by @entity36 , lets divers reach depths of 492ft ( 150 metres )			1
it is made of aluminium , with 18 joints in the arms and legs			0
the suit is able to supply oxygen for up to 50 hours , and maintains communication with the surface via an optical cable			2
it also has four 1.6 horsepower thrusters on the back to help the diver move around underwater at relatively high speeds			0
each suit weighs between 35 ( 226kg ) and 42 stone ( 272kg )			0
prices start at around £ 360,000 ( $ 588,000 )			0
the highly complex mechanism , consisting of up to 40 bronze cogs and gears , was used by the ancient @entity23 to track the cycles of the solar system			0
it was so advanced , it took another 1,500 years for an astrological clock of similar sophistication to be made in @entity65			0
today , the team completed their first dive			0
the rescued antiquities include tableware , ship components , and a giant bronze spear that would have belonged to a life - sized warrior statue			1
components of the ship , including multiple lead anchors over a metre long and a bronze rigging ring with fragments of wood still attached , prove that much of the ship survives , the team say			1
the finds are also scattered over a much larger area than the sponge divers realized , covering 300 meters of the seafloor			1
this together with the huge size of the anchors and recovered hull planks proves that the @entity9 ship was much larger than previously thought , perhaps up to 50 meters long			1
' the evidence shows this is the largest ancient shipwreck ever discovered , ' says @entity90			0
' it 's the titanic of the ancient world			2
' the archaeologists also recovered a beautiful intact table jug , part of an ornate bed leg , and most impressive of all , a 2 - meter - long bronze spear buried just beneath the surface of the sand			1
too large and heavy to have been used as a weapon , it must have belonged to a giant statue , perhaps a warrior or the goddess @entity105 , says @entity90			1
in 1901 , four giant marble horses were discovered on the wreck by the sponge divers , so these could have formed part of a complex of statues involving a warrior in a chariot that was pulled by the four horses			2
@entity117 diving safety officer @entity116 ' spacewalks ' in the @entity6 , suspended from the @entity119 vessel underwater archaeologists looking for buried treasures from an ancient shipwreck in @entity3 have begun testing their high - tech ' @entity6 ' ( pictured being lowered into the sea ) the equipment is being used to explore the @entity9 shipwreck and has allowed them to dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions ( pictured ) over the weekend , the team hoping to find the ancient computer posted a video to @entity134 that shows the @entity6 being tested in @entity135 , near the @entity23 island of @entity9			1
on tuesday , the team wrote on their blog that @entity139 from @entity117 became the first person to dive using the @entity6 in the deep water off @entity9			1
in another blog post on the 29th september , they noted : ' the weather has really blown up in @entity9 , giving us a taste of how harsh conditions can be			2
no wonder there are many shipwrecks in the region			0
the @entity6 , built in @entity35 by @entity36 , lets divers reach depths of 492ft ( 150 metres ) , while still performing delicate tasks , said archaeologist @entity154			1
up until now , divers had only been able to operate at a depth of 196ft ( 60 metres )			2
the suit , which makes the wearer resemble @entity158 , ' expands our capabilities ' , continued mr @entity154 , and ' i 'll be able to grasp , pluck , clench and dig.			2
. for several hours , ' he added			0
archaeologists believe many other artefacts are yet to be discovered in and around the wreck			0
the mechanism was found with a bronze statue of a youth in the wreck of a cargo ship apparently carrying treasures to @entity172 , and researchers are certain that other items on board still remain to be discovered			1
' we have good signs that there are other objects present , ' said @entity180 , head of @entity3 's directorate of underwater antiquities , after exploratory dives in the area in 2012 and 2013			1
' there are dozens of items left , this was a ship bearing immense riches from @entity189 , ' added @entity190 , another archaeologist on the team			0
archaeologists , including @entity90 ( pictured ) have returned to the shipwreck of @entity9 using the @entity6 , which lets them dive to more than double the depths of previous expeditions			1
it was the site of the @entity16 , a 2nd - century @entity18 device dubbed the world 's oldest computer , found in 1900 return to @entity9 project chief diver @entity200 inspects the bronze spear recovered from the @entity202 the archaeologists also hope to confirm the presence of a second ship , some 820ft ( 250 metres ) away from the original discovery site			1
@entity9 , which now has a population of only 44 , was once one of antiquity 's busiest trade routes , and a base for @entity215 pirates , some of whom once captured and held the young @entity216 for ransom			1
he later had them all captured and crucified			0
the @entity23 team is assisted by @entity90 , a marine archaeologist from @entity117 , which was involved in a dive to the wreck of the @entity221			1
the @entity16 ( pictured ) was recovered from a @entity223 cargo shipwreck off the @entity23 island of @entity9			1
previous studies have shown it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years			2
scans in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses @entity90 has helped in outings to identify ancient shipwrecks over the last five years			2
we may find one or more monumental statues that were left behind in 1901 , in the mistaken belief that they were rocks , ' @entity90 said			0
as well as the new @entity6 , the @entity9 expedition will also use robot mapping equipment and new advanced closed - circuit ' rebreathers ' , which will allow divers much more time underwater			1
' we will have more bottom time than any previous human visitors to the site , because we dive with mixed gas rebreathers , ' the expedition 's website said			2
' each diver will have more than 30 minutes of bottom time per day , and will enjoy greater mental acuity and a larger safety margin than that of previous divers at @entity9			1
' @entity9 ( highlighted ) which now has a population of only 44 , was once one of antiquity 's busiest trade routes , and a base for @entity215 pirates , some of whom once captured and held the young @entity216 for ransom			2
he later had them all captured and crucified the @entity16 was recovered in 1900 from the @entity9 wreck - a @entity223 cargo shipwreck off the @entity23 island of @entity9			1
it was discovered in a wooden box measuring 13 inchesx7 inchesx3.5 inches ( 340 × 180 × 90mm ) and consists of bronze dials , gears and cogs			0
a further 81 fragments have since been found containing a total of 40 hand - cut bronze gears			0
the mechanism is said to have been created in around @entity276 , and is believed to be the world 's oldest calculator			1
previous studies have shown that it was used to chart the movement of planets and the passing of days and years			2
more than 80 fragments of the @entity16 have been found , containing a total of 40 hand - cut bronze gears ( pictured ) scans of the mechanism in 2008 found that it may also have been used to predict eclipses , and record important events in the @entity23 calendar , such as the @entity293			2
astronomer professor @entity294 of @entity295 said at the time : ' it is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years			0
' the scans also revealed the mechanism was originally housed in a rectangular wooden frame with two doors , covered in instructions for its use			0
at the front was a single dial showing the @entity23 zodiac and an @entity310 calendar			0
on the back were two further dials displaying information about lunar cycles and eclipses			0
the calculator would have been driven by a hand crank			0
the mechanism recorded several important astronomical cycles known to the @entity320 hundreds of years before that help predict eclipses			0
these include the @entity324 - a period of around 18 years separating the return of the moon , @entity327 and sun to the same relative positions			0
the device could track the movements of @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 and @entity336 - the only planets known at the time , the position of the sun , and the location and phases of the moon			2
the researchers have been able to read all the month names on a 19 - year calendar on the back of the mechanism			0
the month names are @entity348 - suggest that it may have been built in the @entity348 colonies in north - western @entity3 or @entity351 in @entity352			0
the device was created at a time when the @entity223 had gained control of much of @entity3			1
the @entity16 is on display at the @entity358 in @entity359			0

first finds include a *2m* long bronze spear believed to be from a giant statue
@entity365 found @entity9 ship was much larger than previously thought , measuring up to 50 meters long
@entity9 device was recovered in 1900 from a shipwreck in @entity3
it was created in @entity276 , and is believed to be world 's oldest calculator
scans have revealed it was used to chart the movement of planets
the *exosuit* lets divers go to double the depth they normally reach
it also means they can grasp , clench and dig for ' several hours ' at a time
@entity139 from @entity117 has become the first person to dive the @entity6 in the deep blue water off @entity9
