by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 05:02 est , 9 january 2014 promise : @entity3 has pledged to target cheap alcohol and put in a minimum price of 40p per unit campaigners have accused ministers of caving in to pressure from the drinks and supermarket industries to drop plans to impose a minimum price for alcohol			1
@entity3 had pledged to target cheap alcohol , saying a minimum price of 40p per unit could mean 50,000 fewer crimes and save 900 lives by the end of the decade			1
the prime minister even acknowledged the policy would not be popular , but insisted the responsibility of being in government meant doing ‘ the right thing ’ rather than the popular thing			1
however , the policy was abandoned in july , with the government claiming there was not enough evidence minimum pricing would be effective without penalising responsible drinkers			1
now an investigation has found industry lobbyists had at least 130 meetings with ministers and officials in the run - up to the u-turn and key evidence in favour of the policy had been suppressed			2
it revealed health secretary @entity40 had met @entity42 ’s chief executive @entity41 to discuss alternative measures that would not ‘ burden ’ their customers and ‘ penalise the poor ’			1
he also had a meeting with @entity48 executives to discuss their concerns			0
@entity50 , who was then a health minister , had meetings with @entity52 , the @entity53 and the @entity54 – giving them a degree of access denied to public health activists			1
these three meetings were held after the end of a consultation period on the policy – when campaigners still thought it was going ahead			2
the investigation , by the @entity64 , claims ministers suppressed two reports that provided evidence that minimum unit prices would not penalise moderate drinkers or the poor			0
and it highlights the close relationship between alcohol companies and senior politicians ; chancellor @entity75 was handed an award by the all - party group on beer , while treasury minister @entity79 had an ale named after him			2
@entity82 mp @entity81 said the revelations showed that ministers listened more to an industry worried about its profits than they did to experts in public health			2
‘ to my mind the alcohol industry has undue influence within @entity92 , ’ she said			0
‘ i was surprised to read about their level of access			0
’ ministers held a public consultation last year asking at what level a minimum alcohol price should be set – 40p a unit , 45p or 50p			0
the consultation ended in february , but three months later mr @entity40 met @entity42 boss mr @entity41 after the supermarket contacted the @entity103 to request an opportunity to discuss alternatives to minimum pricing ‘ that will encourage responsible alcohol use without penalising poorer families ’			1
briefing notes for mr @entity40 , seen by the @entity64 , show that the health secretary was advised to say : ‘ government is still considering the issue			1
could be open to alternative proposals from industry			0
welcome @entity42 ’s views on this			2
’ two months later , the then @entity118 minister @entity117 announced no minimum price would be set because there was no ‘ concrete evidence ’ the plan would not penalise moderate drinkers			0
but the @entity64 investigation found that there was such evidence , and that ministers suppressed two reports from @entity129 that undermined their case for scrapping minimum pricing			0
mr @entity3 ’s change of heart sparked claims that he had been influenced by his party ’s election strategist , @entity135 lobbyist @entity133 , whose firm is reported to have represented drinks giants			0
dr @entity81 criticised ministers for putting pressure on @entity129 to delay publication of the two reports until after mr @entity117 ’s statement			0
discussions : health secretary @entity40 ( left ) met with @entity42 's chief executive @entity41 to talk about alternatives which would not ' burden ' customers and ' penalise the poor ' ‘ the job of government is to put information in the public domain rather than asking @entity152 to withhold publication – and @entity152 should not have agreed , ’ she said			1
professor @entity154 , special adviser on alcohol to the @entity156 , called on the government to ‘ stop dancing to the tune of the drinks industry and prioritise the health of the public ’			2
a spokesman for the @entity163 said minimum unit pricing is still under consideration and ‘ utterly rejected ’ the allegation that anything untoward had happened in meetings with the alcohol industry			0
shadow health secretary @entity170 said : ‘ after the tobacco industry last year , these revelations raise yet more concerns about the influence of big business on this government ’s policies			1

former health minister @entity50 met with @entity52 to discus policy
health secretary @entity40 discussed options with @entity42 chief executive
