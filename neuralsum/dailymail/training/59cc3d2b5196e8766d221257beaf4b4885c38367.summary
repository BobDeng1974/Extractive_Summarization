she reprised her role as @entity2 after almost two years away from the @entity4 soap			1
but poor @entity5 was left red - faced after fluffing one of her lines during a live scene in wednesday night 's special episode of @entity10 , which saw the actress accidentally call the character of @entity13 by the actor 's real name , @entity16 [ @entity17 ]			1
the star , who left the show in 2013 after a seven - year run , made the mistake during her very first moments on camera , which saw her alter - ego pay a visit to old friend @entity27 ( @entity28 )			2
scroll down for the best of the @entity31 reaction slip - up : @entity5 - who plays @entity2 - accidentally called character @entity13 by the actor 's real name , @entity16 ( @entity17 ) during a live scene in wednesday 's @entity10 episode ' how ’s @entity16 ? ' , she slipped into conversation with @entity27			1
once the show concluded , the actress made light of the incident on @entity31 - where thousands of bemused fans had picked up on her mistake			1
she joked : ' you never answered me @ @entity44 how is @ @entity45 ? ... # leastyouknowitslive # gutted ' along with hundreds of jokes , the 37 - year - old actress ' comment was met with a flurry of support from viewers			2

embarrassed : the actress took to @entity31 to make light of her mistake once the episode ended response : eventually the actor himself took to @entity31 to answer the question on everyone 's lips light - hearted : her co-star @entity28 , who played @entity27 , said the ' nation loved it ' one user tweeted , ' who cares ! nice to have you back on our screens ' , while another enthused , ' you handled it with aplomb ! it was wonderful to see you back '			1
this comes after tuesday evening 's slice of drama saw actor @entity83 , who plays @entity84 , appear to mess up his key line			0
delivering a bombshell to daughter @entity88 regarding @entity89 uncovering the truth about @entity92 's killer , he said : ' she knows you killed @entity92			1
' however , some viewers could n't work out whether he had said ' you ' or ' who ' , with a heated debate breaking out on social media			0
@entity83 took to @entity31 to clarify : ' for the benefit of the @entity100 and mankind in general please rt you			2
thank you ( see what i did there ) # @entity106 # justthebeginning			0
' awkward : actress @entity5 's eyes widened as she realised she had made a mistake in the live show frozen : her co-star @entity28 ( playing @entity27 ) grimaced at her before bowing her head meanwhile , the ongoing @entity92 murder mystery unravelled even further on wednesday evening when a distraught @entity114 ( @entity114 ) was finally told the truth by his girlfriend @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , who pointed the finger at his own parents			1
in a dramatic cliffhanger showdown , the troubled youngster rushed home to confront his father @entity13 ( @entity17 ) and stepmother @entity124 ( @entity125 ) after they tied the knot in front of all their family and friends , accusing one of them of murdering his twin sister			2
shocker ! a series of hilarious memes have emerged online , poking fun at the gaffe she 'll never live it down : even @entity142 got in on the fun @entity144 : @entity145 appeared to think @entity2 was asking after him - but sadly not after an emotional confrontation with @entity89 , who has pieced together the clues in detective @entity153 ' case file , the semi-live episode ended with @entity114 bursting into the family home and declaring , ‘ @entity89 ’s told me - @entity92 was killed in this house … and it was one of you ! ’ this was only the second bombshell of the evening , since it was also revealed that @entity89 is expecting @entity114 ’s child			1
she had fled @entity160 to avoid a confrontation , but her father @entity84 found her waiting in an abortion clinic after uncovering the truth about the pregnancy by checking her phone			0
distraught : @entity114 was finally told the truth about his twin sister 's murder by girlfriend @entity116 suspicious : @entity124 had been wracked with nerves since reading @entity89 's note and was extremely flustered while saying her wedding vows to @entity13 surprise ! it was revealed that @entity89 is expecting @entity114 's child , with her father @entity177 turning up at an abortion clinic to talk her into keeping the baby he proceeded to talk her out of making a rash decision , all the while probing whether she would be going to the police about @entity92 's killer since he still believes that his youngest daughter @entity88 is the culprit			1
‘ i ’m not doing it because i do n’t love it			0
i ’m doing this because i already do			0
it ’s for the best ’ , @entity89 cryptically declared			0
and when @entity88 spilled the beans to @entity114 , he missed his own father 's wedding to find @entity89 at the clinic and tell her he wants to keep the baby			0
shocker : @entity84 confronted his daughter @entity89 at an abortion clinic ‘ i always wanted kids			0
loads of them and i want them with you ’ , he pleaded			0
‘ i know we ’d be young parents , but we ’d be really good at it			0
i ’d do everything for you … both of you			0
’ but it seems @entity89 has already made up her mind and wants nothing to do with the @entity13 family , deciding to tell @entity114 the terrible truth about who killed his twin sister all those months ago			2
@entity124 and @entity13 – who have both been prime suspects in the never - ending murder mystery – certainly raised suspicions throughout the episode as they were both visibly dealing with guilt			1
as they exchanged vows , @entity89 ’s note ( which featured prominently in tuesday ’s programme ) preyed heavily on @entity124 ’s mind			0
visibly flustered , she paused the ceremony to ask where @entity114 was and stopped to get a glass of water			0
anxious : @entity124 struggled to go through with the ceremony and is hiding something from her family recovering enough to continue with the wedding , she made a speedy exit during the pub after - party and seemed to be preparing for the worst when @entity13 came to find her at home , shortly followed by @entity114			2
as suspected , the @entity235 ( @entity234 ) storyline from the first of this week ’s special 30th anniversary episodes was a red herring			2
the soap kicked off with the outraged blonde querying why her father @entity177 thought she had killed @entity92			1
‘ you were pretty angry with her			0
you might have pushed her , she might have banged her head or something ’ , he explained			0
@entity88 retorted : ‘ i told you we had a row , and i slapped her ! ’ not guilty : the @entity235 bombshell turned out to be a red herring , although she did confess she wished she had killed @entity92 , who was having an affair with her father short - lived comeback : @entity5 has returned to the soap for two episodes as @entity2 guilty : @entity259 confessed that she had left her drug addict son @entity260 to die @entity177 was still convinced his youngest daughter is the culprit and tried to cover it up from her mother @entity2 , who returned to @entity160 especially for @entity13 and @entity124 ’s nuptials			1
‘ i did n’t , but i wish i had [ killed @entity92 ] ’ , @entity88 brazenly told her mother			1
elsewhere , soap veteran @entity259 ( @entity267 ) confessed to a murder of her own			0
she went to the hospital to apologise to bed - ridden @entity270 ( @entity271 ) – who has just woken up from her coma – for her son @entity273 ( @entity274 ) putting her there			0
but as she was pouring her heart out about leaving drug addict to die , her grandson @entity276 ( @entity277 ) entered the room and was stunned to discover the truth about his father ’s last days			0
‘ i ’ve killed my son ’ , the god - faring pensioner admitted			0
@entity10 continues on thursday night , when viewers will finally discover who killed @entity92 , and concludes with a fully - live episode on friday			1
