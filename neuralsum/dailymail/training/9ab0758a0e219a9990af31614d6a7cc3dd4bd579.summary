more than half of @entity2 women who work out are ditching sugar - dense cereals for protein - packed breakfasts			1
most female gym bunnies ( 57 per cent ) reveal that health concerns have led them to pack in @entity7 , cheerios and @entity9 in favour of options they feel are of better nutritional value			1
the amount of women having high - protein breakfasts has more than doubled in the past five years ( 3 per cent up to 7 per cent )			1
almost two thirds ( 63 per cent ) of women used to have cereal for breakfast five years ago , now just two in five ( 42 per cent ) do			1
an increasing number of women are even opting for protein supplement - based breakfast products as convenient on - the - go meals			1
sales of products such as protein pancakes , shakes and even protein coffee are up 46 per cent since february at sports nutrition company @entity40 , and it 's women who are driving the change			1
the amount of women taking protein snacks and supplements has almost tripled in the past year ( 6 per cent up to 17 per cent ) , as opposed to a smaller increase of a quarter in men ( 25 per cent to 31 per cent )			1
a spokesperson says : ' these statistics about more and more women taking protein snacks and supplements are n't surprising			1
often cereals are empty calories and do n’t offer much by way of nutrition at all			1
' people are exercising more control over what they put into their bodies and , with even some cereals containing more sugar than a doughnut , understandably people are looking for alternatives			1
' we 've seen huge growth in the popularity of protein products being used as an alternative breakfast			1
' this is often used alongside a morning workout or as part of a general fitness regime			2
' they provide a satisfying , filling and tasty alternative to traditional breakfasts , with the added benefit of being part of a healthy lifestyle for those who exercise regularly			1
bodybuilding warehouse has responded to demand by taking popular breakfast items and redeveloping them into healthier options with reduced sugar and fat			1
' having a protein - filled breakfast in the morning is great because it fills you up for longer and means you will eat less throughout the day , ' continues their spokesperson			1
' this is ideal if you ’re on a diet or healthy eating plan			1
however , whilst high - protein breakfasts offer a number of benefits , you need to be careful to choose options that are n't too high in " bad " fats			1
cereal is n't all bad though - dietitian @entity104 who runs the website @entity106 believes that certain types of grain are just as nutritious as a protein - packed meal , it just depends on the ingredients			1
she said : ' if anyone ever asks me ‘ is this cereal healthy ’ the first thing i do is ignore any claims and branding on the front and turn it straight over to the ingredients list			1
. if sugar is near the top then i ’d probably suggest picking another			1
' the good news is though that most cereals are fortified with nutrients such a iron and folic acid meaning that a bowl of cereal beats a greasy - spoon takeaway any day			1
' ' but having eggs for breakfast has been shown to reduce feelings of hunger later in the day , and all protein sources including milk , greek yoghurt , salmon and whey protein will contribute to our daily protein needs			1
' people who work - out or who are trying to lose weight and preserve their lean muscle mass may need more than the recommended 0.8g of protein per @entity148 of body weight a day , and so including protein at breakfast is a great start to the day			1
