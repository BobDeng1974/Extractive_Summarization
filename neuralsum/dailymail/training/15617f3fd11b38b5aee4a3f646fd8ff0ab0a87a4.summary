a curiously phallus - shaped prehistoric worm has provided a ' crucial missing link ' to understanding the evolution of certain marine creatures , scientists say			1
fossilised remains of the creature dubbed @entity8 were unearthed in @entity11 's @entity10 fossil beds , in the @entity12			1
the area is one of the most important fossil deposits for understanding the early evolution of life during an era of increasing biodiversity on @entity20 known as the @entity21 , which started about 542million years ago			1
phallic : scientists say this newly described creature , dubbed @entity8 , is a common ancestor to two related groups of marine invertebrates whose evolutionary link was previously a mystery researchers from the @entity31 today published the first full description of the creature , found in an area thought to be about 505million years old , in the journal @entity36			1
the strange - looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm , or enteropneust , a seldom seen animal that thrives today in the fine sands and mud of shallow and deeper waters			2
' unlike animals with hard parts including teeth , scales and bones , these worms were soft - bodied , so their fossil record is extremely rare , ' said study author dr @entity51			2
' our description of @entity8 , a creature previously unknown to science , pushes the fossil record of the enteropneusts back 200million years to the cambrian period , fundamentally changing our understanding of biodiversity from this period			1
' detailed analysis suggests @entity63 had a flexible body consisting of a short proboscis , collar and narrow elongate trunk terminating in a bulbous structure , which may have served as an anchor			0
the largest complete specimens examined were 10cm long with the proboscis accounting for about half a centimetre			0
it is thought they probably fed on small particles filtered from seawater			0
' crucial missing link ' : the strange - looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm , or enteropneust , and the sea stars and sea urchins , known as pterobranchs @entity82 , @entity8 's modern day descendants , are themselves part of the hemichordates , a group of marine animals closely related to today 's sea stars and sea urchins , known as pterobranchs			1
since their discovery in the 19th - century , some of the biggest questions in hemichordate evolution have focused on the group 's origins and the relationship between these two branches			2
the @entity99 explosion , or @entity99 radiation , was the relatively rapid appearance , around 530million years ago , of most major animal phyla , as demonstrated in the fossil record			1
before about 580million years ago , most organisms were simple , composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies			1
over the following 70 or 80million years , the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude ( as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species ) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today			2
it ended with the @entity99 – @entity119 extinction event , approximately 488million years ago			2
enteropneusts and pterobranchs look very different , yet share many genetic and developmental characteristics that reveal an otherwise unexpected close relationship			0
professor @entity124 from the @entity125 , who also worked on the study , told the @entity128 : ' @entity120 look very different from pterobranchs in as much as the former are worms , whereas the latter are tiny animals , live in tubes , are colonial and have feeding tentacles			0
' the new insights into @entity8 has shown that it was a common ancestor of both groups , finally providing the missing evolutionary link between these two groups , the researchers say			1
' one of the big punchlines from my graduate work , was molecular evidence that enteropneusts and pterobranchs are closely related , ' added dr @entity51 , who specialises in the taxonomy , evolution and biogeography of hemichordates			0
' it 's astonishing how similar @entity8 tenuis fossils are to modern day acorn worms , except that they also formed fibrous tubes			0
' modern day descendant : @entity120 ( pictured ) and pterobranchs look very different , yet share many genetic and developmental characteristics that reveal an otherwise unexpected close relationship a large proportion of these worms was preserved in tubes , of which some were branched , suggesting the tubes were used as a dwelling structure			0
' the explosive radiation of graptolites in the @entity172 planktonic ecosystems is known only from the diversity of their tubes , ' said dr @entity51			0
' our findings suggest that the tubes were lost in the lineage leading to modern day enteropneusts , but elaborated on in graptolites and retained to the present day in pterobranchs			0
' @entity182 also share many of the same characteristics as chordates – a group of animals that includes humans – with the name hemichordate roughly translating to ' half a chordate			0
' ancient : the fossilised remains of @entity8 tenuis were unearthed in @entity11 's @entity10 fossil beds , which date back to the @entity21 542million years ago			1

scientists say the worm is a common ancestor of two groups of marine invertebrates whose link was previously a mystery
