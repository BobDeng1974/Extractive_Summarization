@entity1 manager @entity0 remembers the first time he clapped eyes on @entity4			1
' i remember he played up front for us when i was at @entity10 in a practice match and i remember saying to @entity12 ( @entity12 , who owned @entity10 ) , " i can get this lad on Â£ 2,000 a week and he 's worth a shot , he wo n't cost anything "			2
' and he said : " no you ca n't sign anyone , i 'm selling the club "			2
i 'll never forget it			0
he got a contract offer ( at @entity33 ) and never forgets that			0
' thankfully for @entity0 , he can finally work with the talented winger			1
spurs have 10 points from a possible 24 at @entity38 this season and where would @entity1 be without their mesmeric attacking midfielder ? he was at his bewildering best on saturday as @entity1 left @entity21 unlucky not to have recorded a shock win			1
one piece of skill in the left - hand corner , that left @entity47 and @entity48 for dead , was particularly outrageous			2
' it 's obvious i 've been working with him in training , ' joked @entity0			1
' some days he does a trick and you laugh at him , it 's laughable			0
you never see him practise it			0
' @entity0 and @entity59 watch the game from the @entity38 touchline on saturday @entity4 and @entity47 ( right ) battle for the ball during @entity1 's trip to @entity21 in the @entity64 @entity59 complained that @entity1 were given one day more rest after the midweek fixtures @entity4 signed a three - year deal in the summer but has been promised a further improvement to his contract should he continue to produce these kind of displays			1
@entity21 manager @entity59 even pinpointed the 25 - year - old as @entity1 's most potent attacking threat ahead of saturday 's clash			1
not that it helped nullifying the @entity78 international 's impact			0
@entity59 provided another explanation as to why his side struggled against @entity0 's men			1
' when you compete in the same condition as the opponent then it 's not a problem , ' he said			0
' we played @entity88 on wednesday , but @entity1 played @entity89 on tuesday and had one day more ( to recover )			1
i do n't complain about it but when you have one less day to prepare then it 's difficult			0
' we do n't feel the @entity64 helps us			2
this week we play thursday in @entity94 , arrive home very late and then have a trip to @entity97			0
' the @entity98 is a very tough competition because it kills all the teams			0

@entity1 earned a *credible* 0 - 0 draw at @entity21 on saturday
@entity4 was at his bewildering best during the match
*palace* manager @entity0 afterwards heaped praise on the winger
@entity21 boss @entity59 *bemoaned* the @entity64 *scheduling*
