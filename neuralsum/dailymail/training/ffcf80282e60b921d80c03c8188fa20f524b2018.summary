by @entity1 reporter published : 08:07 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 12:43 est , 16 september 2012 a lesbian couple have won custody of a child following a court battle with the youngster 's surrogate mother and sperm donor over who could be its legal parents			1
the gay women were awarded sole custody rights of the youngster after a three - year legal wrangle ended in the @entity16 , it emerged today			1
however , the judge 's decision has left the wife of the donor traumatised and upset at the ' selfish ' determination of the lesbian couple to have a baby			1
sperm donation : a legal wrangle over the child went on for three years she told the @entity28 : ' unfortunately , one thing i have learnt about couples who want to have children at any cost is that they are ultimately selfish.the only thing they think about is their need for a child			2
' sperm frozen in liquid nitrogen is preserved at a laboratory the wrangle involving the wife , given the @entity43 ' by the paper , and her businessman husband ' @entity45 ' began after he contacted a sperm donation website			2
donors normally remain anonymous until the child becomes an adult at 18 , but @entity45 wanted the lesbian couple to know him and arranged to donate privately			2
the two women were infertile and used a friend as a surrogate who donated her own eggs making her and @entity45 the child 's genetic parents			0
the lesbian couple then tried to legally adopt the child which is usual in cases involving a sperm donor and surrogate , but were turned down by their local authority			1
to get round this , the @entity28 claims the surrogate mother temporarily changed her surname by deed poll to that of one of the lesbians and this was put on the child 's birth certificate			0
the child was raised by the couple as their own until the night when @entity78 broke down and wept at a dinner party for friends and told their story to the guests			0
one of them was a lawyer who reportedly said that since the two women were not the child 's legal parents , it could be taken into care by social services at any time			1
but @entity45 lost when he took the case to the @entity16 and now he and his wife have changed their will so that an inheritance can only be divided between the children they have together			0
@entity78 had backed her husband 's involvement in donating sperm , but now believes wives should be consulted and counselled before giving them the go - ahead			0
she told the paper : ' no one ever thinks of the wives of the men who donate and the pain they go through			0

gay women were awarded sole custody by a @entity16 judge
