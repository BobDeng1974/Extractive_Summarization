it 's arguable that the @entity1 is the premier domestic competition in terms of throwing up stories			1
@entity7 thrashing @entity5 , @entity8 beating @entity9 and @entity10 winning at @entity11 on penalties all spring to mind without digging too deeply			2
that tradition of shocks is almost certain to form part of @entity17 's team talk when @entity18 entertain the might of @entity20 next month			1
@entity18 ’s annual wage bill is understood to be about £ 1.4million , more than 125 times smaller than their visitors ' – which stands at £ 176m			1
@entity26 ’s new £ 200,000 - a - week contract would see him earn more in two months than the entire squad in @entity28			1
@entity29 scored the only goal of the night as @entity18 dumped @entity31 out of the @entity1 @entity32 ( left , a free transfer ) and @entity29 ( a nominal fee from @entity35 ) are top scorers on four the @entity38 side have earned their night			1
shipwrecked @entity39 were dispatched easily back in august before top flight @entity40 could n't find a way past their lowly visitors in round two			2
in fact , that is something all three higher ranked sides - tuesday 's scalp @entity31 included - failed to do : score against the @entity49			1
@entity50 would do well not to take their trip to @entity53 lightly			1
this is a club on the rise , well set up by @entity17 and steely at the back			2
if they were to pull something else off , it would be comparable to that freezing december night at @entity61 two years ago , the shootout at @entity11 and even more impressive than @entity5 's mauling in @entity64 a month ago			2
@entity17 was brought in over the summer as @entity18 revamped themselves into a club able to bounce straight back into the third tier following relegation			1
they 've done it very cheaply , too			0
top goalscorer @entity29 was brought back from @entity35 for a nominal fee in the summer while @entity32 , his partner , cost nothing			1
the same can be said for @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
seventeen ( 17 ) new players			0
@entity82 ( celebrating at @entity83 on sunday ) cost @entity20 £ 30million from @entity84 @entity85 ( scoring against @entity86 earlier this month ) was a £ 32million capture from @entity88 @entity17 has revamped @entity18 since taking over as manager in the summer @entity50 's side beat @entity91 ( managed by @entity92 ) at @entity93 compare that then to @entity20			1
a fair wedge on substitute @entity96 , too			0
the total amount splurged by the @entity99 club stood at £ 92.5million			2
the tie will not be as lucrative as might be thought , there is no prize money , but a £ 125,000 cheque for what should be a live television game will be gratefully received by a club who lost their @entity109 status last season			1
‘ hopefully we can give a good account of ourselves on and off the field and people will come back and see us more often , ’ chief executive @entity111 told @entity112			0
‘ with my business head on i ’d have preferred to be away at @entity93 with 40,000 people			0
but from the point of view of the chairman , supporters and players we ’re absolutely delighted it ’s at @entity53			0
’ almost 10,000 supporters will be crammed into @entity18 's small new @entity53 ground these sides are worlds apart , and the competition pits them level			1
it does not matter that the @entity133 have lifted the trophy four times before or that @entity18 's greatest achievement was reaching the semi-final in 1961			1
they 've never played in the first division and the only silverware won comes from topping the third tier ( 1979 ) and fourth ( 1994 )			2
there is n't even a @entity142 in the cabinet			0
a trip to @entity38 opposition for @entity20 may provoke thoughts of agricultural football and a pitch to match – but @entity18 provide pristine conditions and a positive style of play			1
‘ the stadium is immaculate , like the day we moved in , ’ said @entity111			0
‘ it does n’t matter @entity20 are coming to town , it could be @entity156 , no disrespect , but we want to do it right off the field			1
‘ on the field we like to get it down and play			0
we know we ’re a country mile away from @entity20 in terms of the ability they have but our lads will relish it			1
some of our lads have the ability to play in the @entity171 or @entity172			0
‘ we want to give a good account of ourselves			0
we do n’t want it be a cricket score			0
we want people to see what we do and come back			0
‘ we are heading in the right direction after last year ’s disappointment			0
our manager is very proactive			0
there are one or two of us who call him @entity183			0
‘ he is a great manager with a great future in the game			0
his attention to detail and organisation is among the best i ’ve ever worked with			0
‘ i ’m sure the club will make sure there is a nice glass of red wine in his office for @entity50 after the game			2
’ this will be their night , with almost 10,000 crammed in baying for another upset			0
@entity50 should take a strong enough outfit not to become another name etched on @entity1 's growing list of casualties			1
@entity20 celebrate @entity205 's goal on wednesday night in the win over @entity91 at @entity93 elsewhere in the draw ... holders @entity83 , who thumped @entity209 wednesday 7 - 0 at the @entity210 will play @entity211 in an all @entity171 affair			1
@entity213 , who progressed after a marathon 14 - 13 penalty shootout win over @entity217 on tuesday night , take on @entity86 in an another contest between two top flight clubs			2
@entity221 host in - form @entity223 at the @entity224 while @entity225 are at home to @entity227 , who were 3 - 0 winners at @entity229			2
the other fourth round ties see @entity232 travel to @entity7 and @entity233 play @entity234			2
@entity225 vs @entity227 @entity221 vs @entity223 @entity235 vs @entity236 @entity18 vs @entity20 @entity213 vs @entity86 @entity7 vs @entity232 @entity83 vs @entity211 ties to be played on the week commencing 27 october 2014 @entity213 's @entity238 ( right ) celebrates his goal before the penalty shootout win over @entity217			1

@entity50 's @entity20 travel to @entity38 side @entity18
@entity49 spent money on just one player in the summer - @entity29
@entity20 spent a *combined* £ *62m* on @entity82 and @entity85
the @entity38 side have never won a *cup* competition
