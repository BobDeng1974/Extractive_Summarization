@entity2 , police and crime commissioner ( @entity4 ) for @entity5 , revealed yesterday he has held talks with a possible sponsor about an arrangement involving all five police forces in the south west region			1
writing on his blog , mr @entity2 , a former detective chief inspector for @entity18 , said he could see ' huge potential benefit to forming appropriate sponsorship relationships with reputable organisations '			1
and according to the @entity22 , he said : ' i am allowed by law to obtain 1 per cent of my budget , which in @entity5 is £ 1million – that is a lot of policemen walking the streets			2
' the 43 police forces across @entity30 and @entity31 face funding cuts of up to 20 per cent by 2015			1
mr @entity2 , who was second - in - charge in the @entity34 child murder case , said : ' the police family in @entity5 is living in austere times with a shrinking budget and workforce			1
' despite those challenges , we are maintaining an efficient and effective service for @entity5			2
' however , our funding needs to be readdressed and i continue to lobby the government for extra funds			0
we are the lowest - funded force and have seen the worst cuts			0
' mr @entity2 said he met a possible sponsor at a crime reduction event last friday and will ask for the issue to be added to the agenda at the next regional pccs and chief constables meeting			2
he went on : ' i can see huge potential benefit to forming appropriate sponsorship relationships with reputable organisations			1
they will give @entity59 greater funding to maintain a high - quality service			0
' they will also ensure that we have the funds to help us to combat crime and provide reassurance to communities			0
' but he added : ' i need to be clear that we are looking for longer - term business support , rather than one - off sponsorships			0
' this will help us to plan and sustain projects that might otherwise not have been possible due to the ongoing financial constraints			0
' i also need to stress that neither myself as police and crime commissioner for @entity5 , nor the force , will ever allow operational functions to become dependent on , or to be influenced by , sponsorship agreements			1
' money - making : writing on his blog , mr @entity2 , a former detective chief inspector for @entity18 , said he could see ' huge potential benefit ' to forming sponsorship deals with reputable organisations @entity84 , which replaced existing police authorities in 41 force areas across @entity30 and @entity31 , were handed the power to set force budgets and even hire and fire chief constables			1
just 15.1 per cent of registered voters took part in the november 2012 @entity4 election - the lowest recorded level of participation at a peacetime non-local government election in @entity96			2
@entity97 , chairman of @entity98 , said mr @entity2 ' rightly recognises ' the force is the lowest funded in the country and fully supported his efforts to lobby government for more funding			0
he said : ' the issue of sponsorship is not new to the police service and any such arrangements are subject to rigorous parameters			0
' sponsorship is subject to a 1 per cent limit of the force ’s total annual income and does not make any of the statutory functions of the force dependent on this funding nor does it allow for any companies to interfere with the duties of the police			0
