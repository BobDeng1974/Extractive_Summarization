a woman has been left ‘ gobsmacked ’ after a camera , packed with memories of her once in a lifetime trip to @entity4 , is on its way back to her after she lost it three months ago on a snowy iceberg			1
photographer @entity9 , from @entity10 , was on an impromptu two - week holiday to the remote region costing around $ 13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip			1
she ’d loaded her @entity16 up with episodes of @entity20 comedian @entity19 ’s chat show to entertain her while travelling to @entity4 and had been watching a @entity22 episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera			1
packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg , surrounded by nothing but ice , snow , penguins and seals , ms @entity9 and her tour group then decided to record a message to @entity19 on her white @entity37 camera			1
‘ we spent an open night on an iceberg , the only thing around us were penguins and seals lazing around			0
i took the camera out of my pocket and said “ everyone let ’s do a very @entity46 from @entity4 to @entity19 because she ’s entertaining us at the bottom of the earth ” , ’ ms @entity9 explained			1
' nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera !

‘ you ’ve got to build a wall from ice to go to the toilet			0
i went to do my wee and the camera must have fallen out of my pocket , i did n’t realise , ’ she said			0
the 34 - year - old was unaware that she ’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings			2
‘ the ship started to pull away and i thought “ where is the camera ? where is the camera ? ” and we thought “ no we were going to send it to @entity19 ! ” , ’ ms @entity9 laughed			1
the story of how ms @entity9 is now being reunited with her camera , which was white and camouflaged in the snow , is nothing short of a miracle			2
before departing on the ship to @entity4 , ms @entity9 and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in @entity90 , @entity91 – the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from			1

@entity122 for @entity125 travel @entity123 was given the camera ‘ with no marking nor name on it ’ and looked through the pictures stored on it , leading him to figure out that it belonged to ms @entity9 as he compared the photos to the mugshots taken from recent expeditions			2
' once they saw all the young faces in the recording they found a voyage that happened to have young people on it ...			0
they then sent my selfie to the ship 's team leaders asking if they knew who i was , ' ms @entity9 explained			2
‘ by looking at its pictures i figured out that it belongs to a passenger of @entity153 , ’ mr @entity123 wrote in an email to the @entity10 - based tour company that ms @entity9 travelled with			2
before @entity9 knew that she would ever be reunited with her lost camera her friend sent her these photos that she had taken of her the 34 - year - old was unaware that she ’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings amongst the many memories from her two - week trip where plenty of fun selfies taken in the stunning snowy environment the group were camping out on an iceberg in @entity118 in december when she lost her camera assistant expedition leader @entity168 replied : ‘ i am amazed and astonished that someone found the camera			1
and returned it ! we looked for it on the following voyage but there was still too much snow cover to find a white camera			0
’ ‘ it does indeed belong to one of our eap27 passengers , @entity9			0
nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera ! if you could possibly get it back to @entity10 via a staff member or passenger , i ’m sure @entity9 will be eternally grateful , ’ ms @entity168 replied			1
ms @entity9 ’s camera , which amazingly still works , is now on its way back to @entity10			1
‘ when they told me the person ’s flight details and the name i thought this is really real			0
i had n’t put out a plea on social media because there is nothing there but ice and penguins , ' she said			0
packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg , surrounded by nothing but ice , snow , penguins and seals , ms @entity9 and her tour group then decided to record a message to @entity19 on her white @entity37 camera @entity9 still intends to send the @entity46 message to @entity19 once her camera returns to her , even if it is a bit late this photo shows the ship that the group travelled from @entity91 to @entity4 in over four days @entity9 has called the trip and the surprise of someone finding her camera in the remote snow ' the most over whelming experience of my life ' ' the effort , patience and goodwill that was put into reuniting me with my memories by strangers has amazed me			1

' my camera was identified as my property by a selfie i had taken and the footage my friends and i had taken to send to @entity19 as that was the last thing on the camera ' i am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all			2
