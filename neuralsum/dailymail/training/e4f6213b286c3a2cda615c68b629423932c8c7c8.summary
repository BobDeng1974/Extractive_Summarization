by @entity0 as @entity1 collapsed in a clatter of wickets and a voracious @entity5 side delivered their wildly improbable victory , a crowd awash with ale and exaltation bellowed chorus upon chorus of ‘ @entity13 ! ’ if you could preserve for posterity a single afternoon of the @entity18 sporting summer , then this astonishing occasion at @entity15 would prove a memorable candidate			1
the reconstruction of an ailing @entity5 team was already proving a stirring success , but it was in this test match , and more precisely in the course of this golden afternoon , that promise was translated into glittering performance			1
but rarely has that glorious quirk been so stunningly demonstrated , rarely have the odds seemed so unpromising , and rarely has the leading man carried such slender credentials			0
@entity31 , or ‘ @entity47 ’ as he is now known in this part of @entity49 , has shuffled almost unwillingly into the spotlight these past few weeks			1
he came to the side with hopes of proving himself a high - class middle order batsman			2
he acquired a reputation for an awareness of events far beyond the playing field with a wristband supporting the humanitarian cause in @entity60			0
and , above and beyond all this , he has revealed himself to be the spinner who @entity5 had almost despaired of unearthing			2
time and again , he made the kind of timely intervention which he has been making all series			0
and the manner of his wickets finally buried his reputation as no more than a bits and pieces bowler			0
down with the kids : @entity31 celebrates and was happy to sign autographs and take photos with kids in attendance his first success , arriving just a ball after @entity78 had made the break - through , was laced with good fortune			1
drawing @entity81 forward , he defeated the bat and struck the pad			0
umpire @entity84 approved the appeal , despite replay evidence that the ball was high and missing leg stump			0
however , @entity1 had declined the use of the review system , and the decision stood			2
not that the crowd had time to waste on such minutiae , as the first celebratory chants boomed out			0
that fortunate success reduced @entity1 to the rubble of 53 for three , but there was nothing lucky about @entity31 ’s next telling blow			1
deceived by skilful flight , @entity99 drove unconvincingly , allowing @entity31 any excellent sharp return catch			2
at that stage , @entity1 had lost three wickets for eight runs in 18 balls , and their hopes of survival were in chaotic retreat			2
the crowd was captivated by the man with the bushy beard and air of modest self - effacement			1
no matter that their local hero , @entity78 , despite being a shade under the weather , was playing his usual admirable part in the general rampage , @entity31 was occupying centre stage in their raucous affections			1
@entity123 salutes victorious @entity5 effort here we go again : this time it 's @entity81 's wicket that falls at the hands of the now - named @entity47 and everything he did , everything he tried , only emphasised his newly won eminence			1
another cunningly teasing ball saw @entity132 prodding forward with unwisely hard hands			0
@entity134 simply devoured the catch and @entity1 stood at 66 for six , with the last rites waiting to be read			2
throughout the day , we had heard how @entity138 was preparing to make her entrance , that chances of play were less than poor , and that the result might be held in abeyance until late on monday , with a draw the heavy favourite			0
only @entity36 stood between @entity1 and a rout , but by now the script had been written			2
@entity147 came @entity31 ’s arm , swish went @entity36 ’s bat , and @entity152 , leaping to his right , penalised the shoddy shot			0
at 105 for seven , the threat of @entity155 had become all but irrelevant , by now , it seemed that the @entity5 spinner had run out of new ways to impose himself on this extraordinary match , but he discovered a further ploy when , with @entity1 on 133 , @entity162 elected to jog a second run			1
he was almost inviting the run out , and @entity31 responded with a superb slide and a pinpoint throw			0
beautiful day : there was no rainfall or signs of a hurricane to stop @entity5 in their tracks on saturday the crowd crowed ecstatically , @entity5 converged upon the executioner in the field , and up in the radio box , @entity174 observed : ‘ there ’s more brains in a pork pie			1
’ @entity134 finished off proceedings , but by then the heavy lifting had been done			0
an innings and 54 runs ! it was way beyond the most optimistic expectations after an abject display at @entity186			0
but the reality was blinking out from the scoreboard , and with it the information that @entity31 had returned figures of 13 overs , three maidens , four wickets for 39 runs			0
‘ @entity196 ! ’ the chant came rolling across the ground as the crowd hailed a genuinely famous victory			1
half an hour after the close , with the rest of the @entity5 team celebrating in the dressing room , @entity31 was down among the fans ; signing scorecards , posing for pictures , enduring a few hundred back - slapping compliments			1
the historians informed us that @entity5 had not won in three days since 1967			1
but the man of the moment was not listening to the historians last night			0
he was enjoying the wonder of the moment , when a test match was won and a new and welcome figure took his well - earned place at the high table of the @entity18 game			1
captain 's pride and joy : @entity28 congratulates @entity31 after he dismissed @entity132			2

@entity31 led the way as @entity1 's batting order collapsed in fourth test
bowler has long shown promise that he transformed into glittering display
the crowd at @entity15 was captivated by his bushy bear
@entity31 took centre stage from local hero @entity78 on great day for both
‘ @entity196 ! ’ came the chant from the crowd
@entity31 was happy to sign autographs and take pictures after the win
@entity5 had remarkably not won in three days since 1967
@entity31 takes well - earned place at the high table of the @entity18 game
