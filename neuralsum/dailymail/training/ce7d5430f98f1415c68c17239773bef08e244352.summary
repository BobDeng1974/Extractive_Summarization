by @entity0 a @entity2 engineering firm based on a remote @entity4 farm are to help @entity5 launch a network of solar - powered drones that will bring the internet to the remotest places on the planet			1
the @entity12 web giant has bought @entity13 , a tiny engineering company run by chief engineer @entity14 , for an estimated £ 12.5million			1
mr @entity14 has helped set records for the longest flights for unmanned aircraft powered by the sun. unmaned : experts will be working on new drones intended to fly 60,000ft above the earth for months at a time while beaming signals to the @entity23 ( file picture ) its experts will now be working on drones intended to fly 60,000ft above the earth for months at a time to beam broadband signals to the @entity23			1
details of the plan were revealed by @entity5 founder @entity32 in a post on his personal page on the site and form part of a project called @entity38 set up to extend the reach of the internet			1
‘ in our effort to connect the whole world with @entity38 , we ’ve been working on ways to beam internet to people from the sky , ’ he wrote			0
‘ today , we ’re sharing some details of the work @entity5 ’s @entity50 is doing to build drones , satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone			1
’ new venture : the plans were announced by @entity32 on his personal @entity5 page today the @entity50 includes experts from @entity59 working on what the company called ‘ new aerospace and communications technologies ’			1
significantly , @entity5 also announced that it had bought @entity13 , which was founded by five @entity2 who previously worked at major technology firms such as @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity5 did not provide any details of the @entity2 experts behind @entity13 , while the @entity4 - based firm refused requests for interviews and referred questions to its new @entity12 owner			1
@entity5 aims to use a mix of solar - powered aircraft and low - orbit satellites to beam signals carrying the internet to hard - to - reach locations			2
the drones , flying at 60,000ft , will be capable of staying in the air for months at a time			1
they are relatively cheap will be best for suburban areas that do not have the cables or infrastructure to carry internet or telephone signals			0
the drones are effectively mobile phone masts in the sky and bounce smartphone communications between satellites and base stations on @entity95			0
low - orbit and geosynchronous satellites , which have orbits that match the @entity95 ’s rotation and are effectively stationary , will cover more remote areas in @entity101 and @entity102			2
the internet access would be transmitted in the form of free - space optical communication , or @entity106 , which transmits data using infrared laser beams			0
it was previously known as @entity110 and has only two directors , mr @entity14 , 51 , and his wife @entity112			0
mr @entity14 has had a long career in the aerospace industry			0
he was a key member of the team at @entity2 defence technology company @entity116 that created the @entity118 drone that holds the record for an unmanned flight , which lasted two weeks			2
the team also includes experts who worked on the @entity123 , a balloon that was designed to circumnavigate the world			0
@entity126 , a director of engineering at @entity5 , said @entity127 would join its team working on ‘ connectivity aircraft ’			2
‘ we ’re looking at a new type of plane architecture that flies at roughly 20,000m , because that ’s a point where winds are at their lowest , it ’s above commercial airliners , it ’s even above the weather , and actually it can stay in the air for months at a time , ’ he said			2
‘ these planes are solar - powered and they sit there and circle around , and have the ability to broadcast internet down			0
’ @entity5 helped found @entity38 last year with other major technology companies such as @entity147 and @entity148			0
it offered no details on how far advanced the drone project was , or any timeframe for completion .			0
