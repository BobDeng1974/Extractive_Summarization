more than 70 years after they fell on a foreign field , the remains of two @entity2 heroes have been found by amateur enthusiasts in @entity5			2
the two unidentified @entity6 died during @entity7 during the @entity9 landings at @entity10 , south west @entity5 in 1943			1
the discovery was made by four @entity2 part - time historians from the ' @entity10 1943 ' association who were carrying out a reconnaissance tour of the hilltop			1
the soldiers were found buried near one another on land between the villages of @entity21 and @entity22 , a few miles from the beach clue : munitions were found near the skeletal remains @entity28 and @entity29 troops landed on the beaches at @entity10 before beginning a bitter campaign in which the ferocity of the @entity34 resistance destroyed @entity36 ’s notion of @entity5 as ‘ the soft underbelly ’ of the @entity39 campaign			1
@entity40 eventually fell on 30 september , three weeks after the landing , and the campaign diverted @entity34 troops from other fronts , bringing @entity45 closer			2
the soldiers , who were identified as @entity28 from the munitions close by , were found buried near one another on land between the villages of @entity21 and @entity22 , a few miles from the beach			1
the two are thought to have died in a @entity52 attack , before being hurriedly and provisionally buried by the victors as they took control of the area			1
they will probably have been listed as missing in action but it is hoped that their relatives can now be traced with dna testing			2
battle site : @entity10 1943 members ( left to right ) @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 study the grave , which they believe was hurriedly made by the @entity66 after they attacked the mayor of @entity68 said : ‘ every new discovery needs to be studied carefully in order to be validated properly			1
‘ but we know our region is rich in historic remains from the second @entity2			2
furthermore , the area of the hill in @entity76 , has been cited many time in historic documents in @entity10 as a place where the entrenched @entity34 observed the movements of the @entity9 troops who landed at @entity10			1
the events also live on in the historic memory of our elder citizens who today will be reminded of those times			0
’ the military position in question was denominated as ‘ @entity87 ’ by @entity28 military forces , and features in the published memoirs of @entity28 soldier @entity91			0
as told by @entity93 , the hill was easily occupied the day september 22 , 1943 by @entity94 but not having had the opportunity to entrench themselves and being few in number they were driven back by a counterattack losing many men			1
on the 24th the @entity101 , including @entity93 , attacked the enemy position			0
as they advanced along the slope of the hill , he recalled that the ground was strewn with the bodies of his fallen comrades two days earlier			0
the battle was hard and there were many casualties on both sides			0
historians will use dna testing to find relatives of two @entity28 @entity2 soldiers whose remains were found in @entity5 @entity118 , one of the four who found the skeletons , said : ' we are in a club of amateur historians so we often go around the battlefield sites with metal detectors			1
' in one of these searches on thursday we came across the two @entity28 soldiers			1
' the metal detectors started going off when they sensed the munitions , so we started digging			0
one was in a trench about 30cm below the surface and one was just beneath the top soil			0
the group thought at first they could be animal bones but when they realised they were human they called the police			2
antique bookseller mr @entity118 added : ' you know immediately which side they were on			0
the uniforms had completely decayed but the buttons and buckles were @entity28			0
' he said the group had previously found two @entity52 soldiers one of whom had been identified			2
the tags worn by the @entity52 troops were metal , rather than the leather of the @entity28 , making them easier to identify			0
he added : ' the research could be quite simple though as there are only a limited number of people that are still missing from the battle over two days on this hilltop			0

bones belonging to two soldiers who died in 1943 have been discovered
they were @entity6 who were *killed* at @entity10 by the @entity66
the discovery was made recently by part - time historians
