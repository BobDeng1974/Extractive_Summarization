residents of what is thought to be @entity3 's oldest town cut their dead in half and buried them from the pelvis up , according to archaeologists			1
the newly discovered ancient settlement , thought to date back to @entity9 , is near the @entity11 town of @entity12 , about 25 miles from the country 's @entity14 coast			1
archaeology professor @entity16 led the dig which focused on the town itself and its necropolis , where the strange and complex burial rituals were discovered			2
strange rituals : some of the corpses found in the necropolis attached to what is thought to be @entity3 's oldest town were sliced in half and buried from the pelvis up ancient : researchers believe the town , located 25 miles from @entity11 's @entity14 coast , is @entity3 's oldest urban settlement and was home to between 300 to 350 people a whole corpse : researchers have as yet advanced no theories as to why some corpses were mutilated before burial and others were interred in their entirety ' now we can say that the @entity12 salt pans location is the oldest town in @entity3 , [ dating from ] roughly 4700 to @entity48 , ' he told @entity49			1
there is as yet no clue as to why some corpses have been sliced in half and buried from the pelvis up , but researchers found evidence to show some residents of the salt - producing area were wealthy people			2
professor @entity16 told the @entity60 the town 's 300 to 350 residents lived in two - storey homes and earned their living mining the surrounding area for salt , which was as important to the ancient world as oil is today			1
' the salt water was evaporated by different techniques in ceramic bowls , ' professor @entity16 told @entity49			0
' @entity72 produced was used as money because salt was essential for both humans and animals			0
' wealthy : the town 's residents lived in two - storey homes and mined the surrounding area for salt , an important resource in ancient times security : to protect their wealth , their town was surrounded by stone walls three metres high and a phenomenal two metres thick the nearby town of @entity12 remains an important salt centre to this day , with much foreign investment in the area devoted to extracting the stuff			1
but in ancient times @entity95 would have needed little in the way of outside money since , as the only place in the @entity100 where salt was produced at the time , it was the ' mint ' of the region			0
to protect their wealth , their town was surrounded by stone walls three metres high and a phenomenal two metres thick , which researchers believe are the earliest and most massive fortifications of @entity3 's pre-history			0
' bun - shaped hairstyles ' : discoveries of spiral - shaped copper needles have even given archaeologists clues as to the hairstyles of the town 's ancient residents skeletons : @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 scientists have so far confirmed the @entity11 team 's findings , which were made during a two - month dig over the summer this map shows the town 's location near @entity12 , just 25 miles inland from the major coastal city of @entity12 other findings suggested that even 7,000 years ago the residents of the town had already developed a class system			1
@entity134 , a member of professor @entity16 's team , told @entity49 that finds of spiral copper needles for hairdressing in some graves showed ' there are two grades of people , [ one ] probably with higher social status '			0
she added : ' we think that women had a sort of bun - shaped hairstyle			0
