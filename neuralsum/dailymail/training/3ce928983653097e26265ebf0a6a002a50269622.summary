by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 09:04 est , 29 november 2012 three car parking spaces in the exclusive @entity3 resort of @entity4 have been sold at auction for a staggering combined total of £ 161,000			1
the two remaining parking bays in the same lot , all measuring just 20ft ( 6.1m ) by 8ft ( 2.4m ) , attracted offers of £ 50,000 each - but failed to sell as the bids did not meet the reserve prices set by the owners			1
the three that did sell went for £ 55,000 , £ 56,000 and £ 50,000			1
the princely sum paid for each is more than double the average £ 22,000 a year wage in the county			0
pricey : three of the spaces sold individually for £ 55,000 , £ 56,000 and £ 50,000			1
the remaining pair attracted bids of £ 50,000 each but failed to make the reserve price and will now be sold by private negotiation for the two lots which did n't reach their reserves individual sales are expected to be agreed privately within the next 24 hours			1
the open - air parking spaces on @entity29 - overlooking the picturesque @entity30 - were sold with the condition that they must be used solely as a car park , with no scope for building , the auction was told			2
expensive : @entity37 brochure detailing the five parking spaces for sale in @entity4 @entity40 , director of @entity42 estate agents , said the going price for each of the lots indicated the importance of a parking space in the town , a preferred holiday destination for thousands of people every year			1
the spaces are roughly 30 seconds walking distance from the beach and the town centre			1
mr @entity40 said : ' ( the auction ) tells me that despite the recession and credit crunch , if you look at the last 30 years , property prices pretty much without fail have gone up in price			2
' clearly in @entity4 , it ’s a diminishing asset with a higher demand so in effect you ’re looking at a price that ’s going up yearly			2
' we are talking about an area where property is happily fetching £ 500,000 - £ 700,000 - if not more			0
' if you have n’t got a car parking space , £ 50,000 is a small price to pay for that extra amenity			1
' successful bidders were also made to pay a premium of £ 5,000 plus vat			0
mr @entity40 added : ' it was slightly unusual , but i think it was quite a successful day			0
' but in a time of austerity the move has less than impressed everyone in the area			0
speaking about the lots when they went up for auction , town councillor @entity85 said : ' it sticks in the throat of local people			2
' it shows the mismatch in @entity4 and many other @entity3 villages and towns between the local population on low wages and seasonal jobs and second home owners			2
' it is ridiculous that many of those that live here ca n't afford a home			0
they ca n't even afford one of these parking spaces			2
the five parking spaces on @entity109 , pictured , overlook the sea			0
three have been sold at auction for a combined total of £ 161,000 , while private deals are expected on the remaining two the guide price for each space was set three months after another space was bought for £ 55,000 in the town			1
located on @entity119 , it is thought to have been sold to a second home owner in desperate need for an additional space in town			0
and that was not the first space to go up for sale			0
not much for your money : the parking space which went for an astonishing £ 55,000 a few months ago popular : @entity130 , bay and harbour in @entity3 is a popular holiday resort and always attracts interest from people wanting a second home two years ago , another parking space in the town went for a whopping £ 60,000 and one three years before that sold for a comparatively meagre £ 24,000			1
all of the sales in the seaside resort pale in comparison to what is thought to have been the most costly space - which went on the market for an incredible $ 1million in @entity146 earlier this year			0
buying that bay would be equivalent to paying a $ 115 ticket for illegal parking every day for 24 years .			0

the spaces in @entity4 sold for £ 55,000 , £ 56,000 and £ 50,000 at auction
two more parking spots received bids of £ *50k* but did not sell as their reserve was not met
the tiny spaces are 30 seconds walking distance from the centre of the popular beach fronted town
