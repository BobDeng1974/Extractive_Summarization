by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 05:10 est , 29 august 2012 sprinter @entity1 already has a @entity3 medal , but winning one this week would be extra special			1
not only is @entity6 2012 a home games for the 22 - year - old @entity8 , but her brother @entity9 is also competing in the swimming pool			1
and if that was n't enough , it is also the first games in which @entity1 's running guide @entity14 will be eligible for a medal , too			1
@entity17 in action with @entity19 during the womens 200m race at the @entity21 in 2011 in @entity5 , only pilot cyclists in the tandem race were eligible for medals			1
but this time around the work of guide runners and sighted goalkeepers in blind football will also be recognised			2
to @entity1 , @entity19 is as integral a component to the @entity31 and 200m dashes in which she competes as her own arms and legs			1
' you have to be completely in synch and get the start absolutely right , ' she says of the relationship she has with @entity19 - who is , incidentally , the stepson of her former running guide , @entity41 , with whom she won silver in the @entity31 in @entity5			1
' we ’re kind of a team — wherever i go , he goes			0
' @entity17 and her former guide runner @entity49 competing in the @entity50 in @entity5 during the 2008 @entity51 she told @entity52 how thrilled she is that @entity19 will finally get the recognition he deserves : ' it is a bit like doing the three - legged race but attached by your hands rather than your feet			1
' to execute the run properly you need to be smooth and in time , with both the pace and the stride length correct			0
@entity14 and i need to communicate to make sure our performance is the best it can be			0
' it 's a team effort , it 's not just me			2
i 'm the one that has to cross the line first , but when i get medals i want @entity14 to be with me because he helps me do it			2
' @entity19 himself said : ' it 's a souvenir for the hard work and dedication i 've put in			2
one of the biggest things is being able to help someone achieve their dreams			0
' i know that i 'm @entity17 's guide , but we come as a team – if she loses , i lose , and if she wins , we win as a team			1
' @entity17 , left , and her brother @entity9 , right , in their official @entity3 portraits @entity19 accompanies @entity1 on each of her races , ensuring she does n't veer out of her lane by running alongside her and talking to her throughout			1
they each hold one end of a rubber figure - of - eight loop made from physiotherapy tubing stuck together with electrical tape			0
' i have to trust @entity14 because i am running at full pelt , ' she says			0
' he talks throughout the race , indicating where we are in the bend , whether i need to accelerate or hold or relax and he always tells me to put my chin back in because i tend to push it out when i run			2
' he definitely has the harder job			0
all i have to do is run , which is the easy part			0
he has to talk and run			0
' happily , the pair - who have been working together for the past two years - get on well both personally and professionally @entity1 worries she can get moody before races but @entity19 has learned simply not to talk to her then			1
@entity17 and @entity14 get in sync in the @entity107 100m event during the @entity108 in @entity109 in 2011 just like her brother ( 18 - year - old paralympic swimming hope @entity9 ) , @entity1 suffers from the genetic , degenerative eye condition @entity114 ’s @entity113 , a disease which has left her registered blind , partially sighted , with only peripheral vision in one eye			1
she was diagnosed with the condition at the age of nine , took up running as a tool for coping while having a difficult time in school , and was spotted by @entity123 when she was 14			0
speaking to the @entity124 , she said ' last year i won gold in the 100m and bronze in the 200m at the @entity130 and achieved two gold medals in the @entity132 this year , so i ’m hoping for two more golds in @entity6			2
' my younger brother , @entity9 , who is 18 , is also competing for @entity135 in swimming ( @entity138 100m butterfly , 100m and 50m freestyle ) , which is absolutely amazing			1
' i hope our success will inspire other young disabled people to get involved in sport			0
it ’s something i ’m passionate about because it gives you so much confidence			0
' i used to be quite shy , but now i think i ’ve found out who i really am			0

he talks to @entity1 throughout the race
