by @entity1 reporter published : 01:00 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 06:16 est , 13 april 2013 @entity2 may be grateful that the @entity3 rushed to the aid of its crippled and malodorous @entity6 cruise ship in february , but as it turns out , it has no intention of footing the bill for the rescue operation			1
the company says all maritime interests must assist without question those in trouble at sea , a duty that would not include reimbursing the @entity18 government nearly $ 780,000 for costs associated with the @entity6 incident			1
carnival released letters friday replying to an inquiry by @entity18 sen. @entity24 , a @entity26 @entity25 who chairs the @entity27 , about the @entity6 stranding and the cruise line 's overall safety record			1
taxpayers stiffed : @entity2 said it has no plans to reimburse the @entity18 governed nearly $ 780,000 for rescuing the stranded @entity6 liner in february rescued at last : @entity6 is docked after being towed to the @entity33 on february 15 , 2013 in @entity34 , @entity35 among @entity24 's questions was whether @entity2 would repay the government for @entity3 costs in the @entity6 case as well as $ 3.4million to the @entity3 and @entity40 from the 2010 stranding of the @entity42 in the @entity43			1
‘ these costs must ultimately be borne by federal taxpayers , ’ @entity24 said in his march letter , adding that @entity2 appears to pay little or no federal income taxes			1
in response , @entity2 said its policy is to ‘ honor maritime tradition that holds that the duty to render assistance at sea to those in need is a universal obligation of the entire maritime community			1
’ the cruise line noted that its ships frequently participate in rescues at the @entity3 's request , including 11 times in the past year in @entity63 and @entity65 waters			0
it did not make direct reference to repaying any money			0
in a statement , @entity24 called the response ‘ shameful ’ and that he is considering ‘ all options to hold the industry to higher passenger safety standards			1
’ those options could include a congressional hearing and legislation , perhaps even a closer look at taxation			0
@entity24 's letter asked @entity2 whether the money it pays in taxes covers the costs of various federal benefits it receives , a question the cruise line again did not directly answer			1
it did mention port taxes and fees and other payments and said it paid $ 16.5billion in wages to @entity18 workers in 2011			0
convenient excuse : @entity2 said its policy is to ¿ honor maritime tradition that holds that the duty to render assistance at sea to those in need is a universal obligation of the entire maritime community ' ‘ every state where our ships call or home port benefits from the dollars spent by cruise lines to buy products and retain services from local businesses , ’ @entity2 added			1
the exchange marked the latest chapter in the saga of the @entity6 , which was disabled by an engine fire during a cruise in february in the @entity114			2
thousands of passengers and crew had to endure five days at sea with no power and under squalid conditions while the 900 - foot vessel was towed to @entity34 , @entity35 , where it continues to undergo repairs			0
@entity24 had asked carnival for details about 90 incidents aboard its ships that were filed with the @entity3 in the past five years			2
nightmare vacation : passengers revealed gruesome details of their ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets , mushy floors , food shortages and stomach - churning odor inhumane conditions : passengers were reduced to going to the bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in the hallways traveling in squalor : passengers aboard the luxury $ 420million vessel had to abandon their overheated , filthy cabins in favor of a shanty town of tents on deck carnival responded that 83 were not considered serious under federal regulations			0
three were the @entity6 and @entity42 mishaps and the capsizing of the @entity154 off @entity156 's coast , which killed 32 people in january 2012			2
the others were more minor ship collisions , an illness and one passenger who jumped off a @entity164 cruise line said it takes each incident ‘ very seriously ’ and undergoes reviews and corrective measures when needed , such as a review of safety and emergency response practices across all of @entity2 's brands following the @entity154 accident			2
in a separate letter , carnival chairman and ceo @entity174 said the company takes the issues raised by @entity24 very seriously			0
‘ we remain committed to the safety and comfort of our guests and we are proud of our ability to provide millions of people with safe , fun and memorable vacation experiences , ’ @entity174 wrote			0
triumph ship set sail from @entity187 , @entity188 on february 7 and was due to return from @entity189 on february 11			0
happy ending : passengers from the crippled @entity6 wait to board buses at the @entity33 after finally leaving the filthy ship a fire in the engine room changed everything and turned this cruise – a honeymoon for at least one couple – into an unforgettable journey for all the wrong reasons for five days the @entity6 had been dragged towards land by tugboats hauling her 102,000 @entity208 is the so - called pride of the @entity210 - a $ 420million vessel which became a ' floating petri dish ' of dysfunctional bathrooms , overflowing toilets , urine soaked carpets , idle air - conditioning units and luxury cabins abandoned in favor of a shanty town of tents on deck or cooler hallways .			0
