@entity1 's 13 - year - old daughter @entity0 looks like an angel modeling a pair of wings on @entity5			1
the image was taken by @entity0 's older brother @entity7 , 15 , and shared on the siblings ' shared @entity5 account earlier today			1
and despite her young age , fans were quick to comment how mature the teenage model appeared - with many of them suggesting that she could easily hold her own among some of @entity16 's most experienced @entity15			1
' @entity0 , who is the daughter of @entity1 and her husband of 16 years @entity32 , made her fashion big fashion debut aged 10 , when she appeared in the first ever @entity36 ad			1
the similarities in appearance between the youngster and her supermodel mother , now 48 , quickly caught the attention of the industry 's elite , many of whom were quick to label the youngster as one to watch for the future			2
at the time however , former @entity48 cover star @entity1 insisted her daughter would have to wait a while before throwing herself into a full - time fashion career			2
' at this point , she ’s too young to pursue a career , ' she told @entity54			2
' there are n’t even a handful of jobs for a 10 - year - old girl			0
but if she ’s 17 and wants to try it ... of course , what can i say ? she ’s really into singing and acting			0

" ' but it seems that @entity1 has since changed her mind - and is now happily encouraging her daughter 's burgeoning career as a professional model			1
earlier this month , the teen made her magazine debut on the cover of @entity48 , a move which @entity1 admits she was 100 per cent in favor of			0
' i ’m happy for her to be happy , ' she told the @entity84 's @entity83			0
' she ’s kind of chomping at the bit and the @entity48 piece seemed like an appropriate thing to do			0
' i am very comfortable with the photographer , who is a woman i ’ve worked with a lot and is a mother herself			0
