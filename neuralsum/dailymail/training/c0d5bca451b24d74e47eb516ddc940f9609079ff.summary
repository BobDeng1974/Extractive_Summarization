above , the pensioner on @entity34 in 1994 kitted out : ms @entity35 , donning a thick red coat and white helmet , is given instructions by a male colleague dedicated : ' getting off helicopters on to the deck in 90 mile - an - hour winds is horrible as i am only little and i get blown around the place , ' she said			1
above , ms @entity35 is pictured on the @entity34 20 years ago ' the guys used to have to form a human chain and pass me up the steps , but over time , i have grown accustomed to flying by helicopter and now it 's not as scary as it used to be			1
' but there have been some particularly hairy moments , such as flying through a lightning storm , and on another flight back to @entity83 many years ago , the pilot calmly informed us that one of the engines had failed and we were relying on just one			0

i had to share a cabin with four men , and use the same communal showers and toilets as them			0
' on my first day on the rig , i arrived in the afternoon when most of the men were asleep after doing a 12 - hour night shift			2
male atmosphere : the pensioner said she was forced to make herself ' one of the boys ' to survive offshore ' the last thing these guys expected was to see a woman arrive on the rig and that was certainly made clear when a man walked past me naked on the way to the showers			2
' another time , i was sharing a cabin with a young guy who was quite shy about being in the same room as a woman			0

' i tried not to complain and i got my hands dirty , i did n't want to be seen as some little woman who needed special treatment			0
' i would have to get a steward to check if the communal toilets were empty before i went in and i 'd leave a pink towel over the door so that the guys knew not to come in , or come in at their peril			0
' my handiest qualification for dealing with the rig crew proved to be primary teaching			0
