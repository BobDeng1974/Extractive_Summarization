by @entity0 few rock icons can claim to still be going strong after 60 years , but today marks the anniversary of the first @entity3 being built , and the music icon is still as popular as ever			1
designed by @entity6 in a small workshop in @entity8 , @entity9 , six decades ago , it has been used in all genres from country to reggae , and from rock to pop and was the only guitar to challenge the @entity15 for popularity			2
today the guitars are built by hand in @entity6 's factory in @entity20 , @entity9			2
each @entity3 starts life as a long , thin piece of ash wood which is shaped into a neck by machine , before being hand laid with either more ash or rosewood for the fret board			2
the frets are then hammered in by hand , using a machine to tighten them			0
the body , which can be made of two , three , or even four pieces of wood , is then given its shape by a machine which cuts holes for the controls , tremolo bridge and other metal parts which are assembled by hand			2
the neck and body are then hand shaped by workers using sanders before being sent through the paint shop , which uses similar technology to car factories			0
the paint is then left for three days until it properly dries			0
finally , the body and fret are given a final shaping , which puts the high - gloss finish on them , before being sent through quality control where they are examined , tuned and given a final check before being sent out			0
designed to be used by country musicians , the guitar was first memorably played by @entity63 and became his signature as an artist			2
one of the defining images of the 50s was holly pictured with the guitar high up on his chest			0
from there it was taken up in the early 60s by the likes of the @entity74 who favoured it for it 's wailing sound , and later by @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
the birth of heavy metal saw the @entity3 take on new life in the hands of @entity85 , while @entity87 's famous @entity86 only added to the instrument 's iconic status			1
the guitar then passed into the capable hands of modern - day musicians such as the @entity94 's @entity93 , @entity96 's @entity95 and the @entity98 's @entity97			1
other memorable players include @entity100 , @entity101 , the @entity103 ' @entity102 and @entity105 ' @entity104 , to name but a few			1
it was originally created in the 1950s by @entity6 to replace the earlier @entity108 unlike the big - band @entity108 , the @entity3 was designed for use in smaller bands and groups and also featured a contoured design to make it more comfortable to wear the body of a @entity3 ( top ) is given this basic shape by a machine , but it repeatedly shaped and reshaped by hand using sanders to give it a high gloss finish ( right ) the neck of a strat is also initially shaped by a machine , but the fret board is laid on by hand before the metal frets themselves are hammered into place by workers in the paint shop , brand new guitar bodies are sprayed using similar technology to car plants			1
they are then put into racks which slowly move them across the floor to be finished			0
in total , it takes three days for the paint to dry at the end of the manufacturing process all @entity6 guitars are put through a rigorous testing process , when they are checked for quality , finish and tuning other 60s musicians to take up the instrument included @entity78 , who famously played his flipped over because he was left handed			1
the @entity150 ' @entity80 was also a fan of the @entity6 , pictured here in 1970 while stars such as @entity153 are happy to buy @entity154 straight off the rack , @entity6 also offer a custom shop where almost any aspect of the guitar can be tweaked showing the instrument 's infinite flexibility , it was perfectly suited to both the slow - hand style of @entity79 ( left ) and the harsher tones of @entity87 ( right ) @entity164 band @entity85 brought the @entity3 with them into the heavy metal revolution and carried on using the instrument form many years still rocking : restoration expert and master builder @entity167 works on the body of a heavily used @entity3 at the @entity20 factory in @entity9 the @entity3 has been used in virtually every genre , from reggae to rock , pop to punk			1
here blues legend @entity174 performs with one during a concert in @entity176 , @entity9 @entity177 hands @entity179 legend @entity178 his 1957 strat			0
@entity177 sold @entity181 his first stratocaster for $ 200 and a pair of cowboy boots			0
@entity181 said : ' i love the versatility of the guitar as much as anything , no matter what way you want to play it , it always responds ' @entity95 , the force behind grunge band @entity96 , used a @entity3 and the @entity98 ' frontman @entity97 was also a fans of the guitar in the band 's early days golden oldie : @entity198 performs with his stratocaster			1
he said : ' it 's the machine of my dreams			0
it 's the @entity204 , the @entity205 , the lightning rod , surfboard , magic carpet for music '			0
