hewn ruthlessly from the earth by water over 270million years , these stone structures are a testament to the power of the natural world			1
the pillars , arches and columns rise hundred of feet into the air over a vast region of southern @entity11 , striking awe into observers who have flocked to the area for thousands of years			1
known as karsts , the limestone structures - captured in these images for @entity18 - are created when water forces fissures , sinkholes , cracks and caverns into the soft rock , leaving only a series of monoliths above ground			2
vast : @entity29 - dropping limestone ' karsts ' formed by erosion over 270million years soar hundreds of feet into the air across a huge region of southern @entity11			1
pictured , climber @entity33 takes the hard way up @entity35 , an arch which was formed from the remains of a collapsed cave			0
sightseers can take an easier dirt track awe : the enormity of the structures is clear compared to the size of the cavers ascending them , from a limestone spire in the @entity48 canyon ( left ) to the @entity49 in @entity50 ( right )			2
seeing these sights can be much easier , as a new glass elevator delivers less intrepid tourists to the foot of the arch @entity11 's @entity56 is one of the largest , with huge arches which once belonged to cave systems but now protrude awkwardly above the lush green hills around			1
covering an estimated half a million square kilometres , south @entity11 's is one of the largest and most significant in the world			1
while limestone structures are common , only in a humid , tropical environment can there be enough movement of water to create such dramatic change , and form structures which have earned the @entity72 recognition as a @entity73			0
but just as with an iceberg , what can be seen in these photographs is only the tip. the flowing water has not only carved up the landscape above the ground , but has also transformed it below			0
@entity11 is home to some of the largest caves in the world , which even now are still being mapped and explored by researchers from around the world			1
heading the charge is a team led by @entity88 , the chairman of the @entity89 who has been traveling to @entity11 for more than 30 years			1
otherworldly : the landscape was formed by water in the humid region seeping in through cracks in porous rock and gradually opening up sinkholes , fissures and caves all work and no play ... : those pictured have devoted their careers to exploring and mapping the hostile cave landscape down below - but do come up for air occasionally map : beneath southern @entity11 's landscape researchers have discovered some of the largest underground chambers in the world			1
in 2013 a @entity112 - led expedition used a laser scanner to map the @entity114 of @entity115 , pictured , whose maximum height is 627 feet			1
a passenger jet is shown for scale the images are from the july issue of @entity18 magazine he and his explorers have used pioneering laser scanners to map the complex , unstable systems in unprecedented detail , including the @entity114 of the @entity129 cave system - since confirmed as the second - largest known cavern in the world			1
despite its entrance from the outer world comprising just a narrow , unobtrusive gap in stone in the forest , it has a maximum height of 627 feet			0
the cavern must be explored in hostile conditions - including high humidity and a lack of any natural light - using a mixture of computer technology and old - fashioned caving bravery			0
with fissures and sharp points of rock , a wrong step could mean injury or death , and the cavern is so large it could fit a fleet of jumbo jets with plenty of room to spare			0
other caves are less formidable			0
in one part of the region , an entire village of 21 homes - with no need for rooves - is situated inside a cavern together with a primary school , a basketball court , and an increasing stream of tourists			0
more still have been made safe for people to explore without the risk of losing their hats			0
it is not all work and no play for the explorers			0
some feature in these photos , where they take time off from their caving work to ascend the other side of @entity11 's fantasy landscape			2
that is despite there being far more tourist - friendly ways to ascend the limestone structures , which are mainly in @entity11 's @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 provinces			1
one , the @entity49 in @entity50 , includes a glass elevator which delivers the less intrepid to the foot of the arch so they do not have to climb			0
it is a vision of the future - and it 's predicted the caves will be next			2
with @entity11 becoming one of the fastest - growing economies in the world , tourists from other parts of the vast nation are already streaming underground - though how long it will take to install a glass lift there remains to be seen			2
the images are from the july issue of @entity18 .			0
