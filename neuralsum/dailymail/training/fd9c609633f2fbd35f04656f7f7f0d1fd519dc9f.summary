just over 8,000 years ago a huge landslide occurred off the coast of @entity2 , known as the @entity3			0
the event created a catastrophic tsunami , with waves almost half as high as the @entity7 , that battered @entity8 and other land masses			1
and now the most accurate computer model ever made of the tsunami suggests that it wiped out the remaining inhabitants of a set of low - lying landmass known as @entity15 off the coast of the @entity8			1
scroll down for animation of the tsunami a new model by researchers at @entity21 has revealed the devastating effects of a tsunami caused by a landslide off the @entity2 coast over 8,000 years ago			2
it 's believed the event would have devastated an area of low - lying land known as @entity15 that once connected @entity8 to mainland @entity30 the new study from researchers at @entity21 is being presented at the @entity32 in @entity33 this week			1
using advanced computer modelling and paleobathymetry - the study of underwater depths through history - they describe how deadly the tsunami would have been			1
and they conclude it would have spelled disaster for the remaining inhabitants of @entity15			1
‘ the research we ’ve done is using advanced computer modelling to look at the @entity3 slide , ’ dr @entity44 , one of the authors on the study , tells @entity47			1
@entity15 is a former landmass that once connected @entity8 to mainland @entity30			2
it is believed to have disappeared after being flooded by rising sea levels in about 6,500 bc. it was likely home to mesolithic tribes ( 10,000 to 5,000 @entity57 )			2
since 1931 , a number of discoveries have been made in the @entity60 that suggest clues as to what the landmass would have been like			2
the remains of mammoths , lions and other animals , in addition to prehistoric tools and weapons , provides evidence for settlement by humans and animals			0
‘ we ’re the first to discover dissymmetry at the time , which no model has done before			0
‘ so we ’re able to quantify what the tsunami looked like at @entity15 – no other study has predicted what the wave would have looked like			1
’ the huge wave that was created in the @entity3 occurred when a large chunk of coastal shelf 180 miles ( 290 km ) long fell into the sea			0
the slide was a single event 8,200 years ago , creating a wave that travelled across the @entity91 in a few hours			2
fifteen hours later , the wave would have reached @entity93 and @entity94			0
dr @entity44 said it would have been equivalent to the 2011 @entity98 tsunami in its scale			1
the landmass once connected @entity8 with @entity30 , and is believed to have been inhabited by @entity103 tribes			2
@entity104 recovered from the @entity60 provide evidence as to the land 's habitation			0
the tsunami is thought to have wiped out the last people to occupy the area , who were by then restricted to an island waves at @entity15 would have been five metres high , as opposed to 10 metres in the @entity98 tsunami , as the land was so low - lying just a few metres above sea level			1
‘ it would have been completely inundated by a 5 - metre wave , ’ dr @entity44 explains			1
‘ if you put a 5 - metre wave towards @entity15 it would have been devastated			1
’ archaeological evidence for this area is relatively sparse at the moment			0
so far , we are relying mostly on finds made by fisherman			0
but the evidence heavily suggests it was inhabited and , according to dr @entity126 of the @entity127 who authored the book @entity30 ’s @entity130 : the @entity131 of @entity15 , they would have ‘ suffered dramatically			1
’ ‘ if we look at what the study tells us they ’re talking about waves that are , in @entity138 , as much as 40 metres high , ’ he says			0
‘ the inhabitants of any low - lying areas like @entity15 would have suffered dramatically if hit by something of that size			1
’ divers from @entity144 , searching for @entity15 , the underwater country dubbed ' @entity8 's @entity146 ' , in 2012			2
the underwater area is hard to explore as it is a busy sea lane with murky waters @entity144 's artists ' impression of life in @entity15			1
further research will be need in order to discern just how many people were living on @entity15 , but it 's unlikely many or any survived the deadly tsunami caused by the @entity3 dr @entity126 continues , however , that is hard to know exactly the extent of habitation on @entity15 because it is very inaccessible			1
described as ‘ @entity162 ’ it is now located under busy sea lanes in murky water			0
thus , according to dr @entity126 , ‘ we know little about the people who inhabited these areas			2
’ dr @entity44 says that modelling tsunamis of this type are important for understanding our history			1
but they can also provide us with data on what we can expect from similar events in future			0
although he stresses no such event is likely to occur any time soon , the @entity8 is susceptible to such dangers			0
‘ part of the research is to find out what would happen as the oceans warm , ’ he says			0
‘ rising sea levels are an indicator but there ’s no correlation between rising sea levels and tsunamis			0
’ the chances of another event on the scale of the @entity3 happening soon is , he says , ‘ not likely to happen at all			2
’ dr @entity126 adds , though , that these events are known to have occurred throughout history			0
‘ we sometimes think we ’re a safe place to live in the @entity8 , ’ he says			0
‘ but sometimes there are risks even in @entity8 and that ’s worth noting			0

research has modelled in *detail* a historic and deadly tsunami
the most accurate computer models suggest it devastated landmasses
these *include* @entity15 , a low - lying area that was home to tribes
the tsunami would have wiped out any people remaining on the island
dr @entity44 compares the event to the 2011 @entity98 tsunami in scale
