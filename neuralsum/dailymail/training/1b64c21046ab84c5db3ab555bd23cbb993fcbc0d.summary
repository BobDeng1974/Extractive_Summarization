@entity0 has been confined to the @entity2 embassy in @entity3 for more than a year - and it appears that he may be going slightly stir crazy			0
the fugitive @entity5 founder has appeared a bizarre music video combining rap and soft rock to humorously push his party 's candidates in the forthcoming @entity12 election			1
the clip shows @entity0 dressed up as an 80s rocker and shot in soft - focus black and white as he delivers his political message to the tune of one of the country 's biggest hits			2
scroll down to watch the video surreal : @entity0 dressed up in stereotypical @entity12 clothing for an online music video 80s style : the @entity5 boss performs a parody cover version of @entity28 by @entity29 @entity5 hit the headlines once again last week , when @entity31 - now known as @entity32 - was jailed for 35 years for leaking @entity34 government secrets to @entity0			1
but the website boss , who is wanted on rape claims in @entity37 , showed a light - hearted demeanour in the music video which was posted on @entity40 yesterday			0
the clip was produced by @entity42 , an @entity12 duo who produce regular videos in which they comment on the news using comic rap lyrics			0
their latest offering deals with @entity12 's federal election , which takes place next week , comparing the poll battle to the medieval - themed tv show @entity53			1
candidate : the video was made to promote the @entity56 which was founded by @entity0 the first few minutes of the video feature a merciless parody of the two principal election candidates , @entity61 's @entity60 and the @entity63 @entity62 , as well as former prime minister @entity64			1
the video 's presenter seems unimpressed with the mainstream candidates - but at that point , the camera cuts to the @entity2 embassy in @entity70 , @entity3 , where @entity0 has been staying since the @entity71 ruled that he should be deported to @entity37 to stand trial in june 2012			2
the co-presenter refers to @entity0 's bid for the @entity12 senate , where he hopes to represent his own @entity56 , but suggests that the eccentric - looking fugitive ' needs a makeover ' to appeal to ' all the @entity78 and blokes back home in @entity81 '			1
the clip then skips to show @entity0 , dressed in an @entity12 sports top with a tie around his head decorated with the national flag			2
he throws out stereotypical @entity12 phrases such as ' good on ya ! ' and ' bloody oath ! ' interview : the segment of the video featuring @entity0 was filmed at the @entity2 embassy in @entity3 rivals : @entity0 croons out his tune in front of actors playing election candidates @entity60 , @entity64 and @entity62 then the video becomes even more surreal , as it segues into a parody of 1986 soft rock hit @entity28 by @entity29 , one of @entity12 's best - known songs			1
@entity0 is filmed from side - on in black and white as he croons while wearing a long blonde wig , while in the background there are clips from videos released in the past by @entity5			1
the political lyrics include : ' we 've got to make things leak , so we can get much bolder - oh we 're all wire - tapped now , we 're all being fed lies			0
' he sings , ' not long till we get all the rats out , ' as the actors playing @entity60 , @entity62 and @entity64 appear behind him			0
when he reaches the chorus , ' you 're the light that the world 's demanding , ' @entity0 spins around and appears in a line with multiple versions of himself			0

the @entity5 party is fielding just six candidates in the election on september 7 , including @entity0 himself who is running for the senate in @entity140			1
if elected , he would probably be unable to take his seat , as he can not leave the embassy without being arrested by @entity144 police and deported to @entity37			0
