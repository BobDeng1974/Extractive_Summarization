the annual what kids are @entity35 survey found that while old classics like @entity40 ’s @entity39 were still read at school , children were not necessarily enjoying them the most			1
and for the first time since the charts began , @entity4 ’s novels including @entity43 and @entity44 have dropped out of the top 20 most popular			1
the survey is based on an analysis of software that assesses the books children read and their understanding of those stories			2
pupils in 2,257 schools took more than nine million quizzes giving details of the books they had read and their favourites			2

‘ primary school pupils , particularly in years 1 to 5 , show a strong preference for challenging books which are significantly beyond their natural reading age			1
‘ we then see a marked difference in year 7 where favoured books are no longer above chronological age , but six months below it and in ensuing years the difficulty of books plateaus or declines			0
