but he was quickly slapped down by the judge who warned him ' we will hear the evidence			0
' the child killer even suggested a panel member had fallen asleep at one point during the hearing			1
the tribunal is being held because @entity2 wants to be judged sane and moved from maximum security @entity19 on @entity7 , where he is being force fed , to a prison , where he believes he will be free to starve himself to death			1
the 75 - year - old complained that he had heard all the evidence before as a criminal psychologist was questioned over several hours about his mental health			1
at the end of dr @entity32 's evidence , judge @entity28 , chair of the three - man tribunal panel , asked if @entity2 wanted to say something			1
@entity2 , wearing dark sunglasses , a dark jacket , white shirt and tie , spoke in a low , gravelly @entity40 accent			2
many of his words were inaudible			0
referring to dr @entity43 , who sits on the tribunal panel , @entity2 said : ' it even apparently lulls him to sleep			1
' the mental health tribunal itself is taking place behind closed doors at @entity19 on @entity7 two faces of a killer : a sketch of @entity2 , feeding tube in nose , and , right , in 1965 @entity2 said he had left the tribunal for around two hours this morning because the lawyers and the witness were going over old ground			1
' i 've listened to this ad nauseam			1
i know it by heart , ' @entity2 said			2
but judge @entity28 cut him off , saying : ' we will hear the evidence			0
' if we take the view someone is wasting time you can be pretty certain they will be told			0
' the hearing is being held in a room inside @entity19 and relayed by video to @entity74			0
moors murderer @entity75 was glimpsed today in the tribunal room at the maximum security @entity19 in @entity7			1
he wore a pair of dark spectacles and had what looked like a tube up his nose court artist sketch of @entity2 ( left ) appearing via video at the mental health tribunal , the first time he has been seen in public for decades link : proceedings are being relayed by video to @entity93 and relatives of @entity2 and fellow killer @entity96 's victims at a court 40 miles away in @entity74 moors murder victim @entity98 , who was just 10 when she was sadistically murdered the tribunal heard evidence yesterday about his behaviour inside the hospital			1
he only comes out of his room at night and shuns contact with others , partly due to his superiority complex			0
but he also fears other patients and habitually carried a pen between his knuckles as an improvised weapon , until it was taken away			2
as well as his " nocturnal " existence , @entity2 was described as contemptuous of his peers			2
he shows anger that can erupt over minor matters and unleashes verbal tirades against staff and other patients , the tribunal heard			2
he also targets individuals , both staff and patients , attempts to manipulate others , bypasses security and bends the rules to suit himself			2
he will only deal with people " high up " the hospital hierarchy - consistent with his narcissistic personality disorder , the tribunal heard			1
@entity2 , who has been on hunger strike since 1999 , claims he has faked psychotic episodes by ' acting ' in the past			1
the hearing was told of hospital records from january 29 this year stating how @entity2 has now ' almost totally isolated himself '			1
innocent : @entity134 ( left ) and @entity135 ( right ) were murdered by @entity75			0
@entity134 's body is still missing			0
@entity2 has never revealed the whereabouts of the 12 - year - old 's body @entity140 search : police scour @entity142 for the bodies of the children killed by @entity75 in this 1986 file picture @entity75 ( right ) arriving at court by taxi in 1966			1
he is @entity149 's longest - serving prisoner evil : @entity96 died in hospital aged 60 after suffering respiratory failure in 2002 following a seizure last july , hospital notes recorded him saying : ' if i have to , i will never let them see me in pain			2
i will act as if i have not a care in the world			0
' @entity2 is currently ' nursed ' in the hospital setting because he is regarded as being severely mentally ill. but if he was deemed fit to be returned to a jail , the regime would be much less ' tolerant and flexible ' of his behaviour and the abuse he metes out to staff and others , the tribunal heard			1
dr @entity169 , a criminologist and forensic psychologist called by @entity2 's legal team to support his case , told the hearing @entity2 wished to have control over the manner and timing of his death but that view did not arise out of mental illness			1
@entity2 reasoned he had no prospects of release or of a better life			0
he said @entity2 had a lifelong severe personality disorder which had not diminished at @entity19			0
however , psychotic symptoms of mental illness he had shown in prison had reduced			0
he said it was possible he could relapse if transferred to prison but added that the prison system could manage his current condition			0
a further review to decide if he needed to be returned to hospital could take place if his mental health deteriorated , dr @entity169 added			1
@entity2 and partner @entity96 murdered five youngsters in the 1960s , burying their bodies on @entity142 above @entity74			0
both were jailed for life at @entity200 in 1966			0

at one stage , he said @entity2 had been exchanging letters with a woman he believed to be ‘ a reincarnated @entity206 ’			0
he told a prison visitor that he could ‘ walk through locked doors at night ’ , he added			0
dr @entity209 is @entity2 ’s responsible medical officer at @entity19 but said the mass murderer had refused to engage with him for more than a decade			1
he believes @entity2 continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia , recounting how the delusions escalated in the 1980s when he began adding excessive amounts of salt to his food			1
he said it showed that @entity2 thought his food was being tampered with – a psychotic symptom			0
