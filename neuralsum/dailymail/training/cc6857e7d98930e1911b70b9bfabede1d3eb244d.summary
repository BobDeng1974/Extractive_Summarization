by @entity0 published : 09:44 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 10:28 est , 4 december 2012 @entity1 has applied for a patent for a wash basin with taps that can not only spout water but also blow hot air to dry your hands			2
the innovative @entity10 company , already famous for its vacuum cleaners and @entity13 hand driers , outlined the design in an application to the @entity16			1
while some public toilets already include integrated systems where visitors can wash their hands and dry them in the same place , @entity1 's innovation appears to be making both the water and the air come from one mechanism			0
all in one : @entity1 has applied to patent a new device that would integrate taps with a hand drier , allowing people to wash their hands and dry them without moving away from the sink in @entity35 patent application 2012/0291195 , filed last week , the @entity32 , @entity33 - based company explains how the unit is operated by sensors which will release water from the underside of a spout			1
when users finish washing their hands a further pair of sensors recognise when they place each hand beneath a pair of ducts which then activate the drier to blow hot air to dry them off			1
the invention is an advance on the traditional set up which forces toilet goers to wash at a sink , then walk with dripping hands to a wall - mounted drier , where there may be a queue			1
sir @entity1 : the filing is likely to create a buzz since @entity1 has since its inception been associated with clever and clean design and engineering it does n't move on far from the increasingly common washbasin with integrated drier set up			2
it is simply , as @entity1 asserts in their patent application , their first dual purpose fixture that combines both functions			0
the filing is nevertheless likely to create a buzz since @entity1 has since its inception by inventor @entity1 with his bagless vacuum cleaner been associated with clever and clean design and engineering			0
the filing , filed on may 17 , proposes a ' dual - purpose fixture for a sink or wash basin , incorporating both a water tap and a hand dryer '			2
it says : ' the water tap has a spout arranged to project over the basin of the sink , and the hand dryer incorporates two or more hand - dryer nozzles â€” at least one for each of a user 's hands			1
' the left - hand nozzle is located on the left - hand side of the spout and the right - hand nozzle is located on the right - hand side of the spout , specifically so that the spout acts as a dividing partition between the two hand - dryer nozzles			0
' this encourages correct usage of the hand - dryer			0
the fixture may be fitted to a sink or wall - mounted above the sink			0

hands - free device is operated by sensors that both activate tap and drier
application likely to cause a buzz *due* to *reputation* of the @entity10 firm
