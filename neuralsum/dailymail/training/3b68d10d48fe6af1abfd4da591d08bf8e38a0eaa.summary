by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 05:01 est , 10 april 2013 troubled teen star @entity1 caused uproar when he bought a @entity4 monkey , called @entity5 , for his 19th birthday , and was then forced to leave her stranded alone in @entity9 quarantine because he did n't have the correct paperwork to travel with her			2
the instance raised the question of whether celebrities are viewing pets as mere accessories , without realising or being properly prepared for the huge responsibility they come with			0
puppies , in particular , are proving popular with young stars			0
@entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 have all got one , @entity23 is debating whether to get another , and the celebrity puppy craze looks set to continue - but according to new research , the majority are not properly prepared			1
puppy love : celebrities such as @entity19 often are seen wielding tiny pets , but a dog is a big commitment monkeying about : @entity1 was forced to leave his new pet monkey @entity5 in @entity9 customs , as he had failed to prepare the correct paperwork for her to travel despite nearly nine in ten dog - owners in the @entity38 claiming that getting a puppy is like raising a child , the majority are not preparing themselves for the responsibility , according to a survey			1
moreover , 59 per cent of people quizzed by @entity45 admitted they were not completely prepared for their new arrival , and 55 per cent said the experience was more stressful than they had previously anticipated			1
more than a third of the 2,000 dog - owners surveyed said they felt the same or more stressed than they did raising a puppy as they did raising a child			1
owners complained of doggy damage to their homes , with soiled carpets ( 77 per cent ) , chewed items ( 62 per cent ) , or torn sofas , carpets and walls ( 22 per cent ) cited as the main problems			0
some 76 per cent of puppy owners waited less than two months between deciding to get a puppy and actually collecting their pet , while 21 per cent waited less than a fortnight			1
two - fifths did absolutely no research whatsoever , and among those who did the majority only researched costs such as vet fees , insurance payments and cost per breed			1
less than half looked into potential behaviour problems , and only two - fifths investigated which breeds were best with children			2
and 17 per cent did n't socialise their puppy with other dogs at the start , as they were worried how it or other dogs would behave			0
@entity91 fancy : @entity21 posted these snaps of her with her new @entity91 bulldog on @entity94 , but many owners say they were surprised by the amount of work involved in caring for a pet three - fifths of those who did no research said they either thought they knew enough or felt they just did n't need it , while one in six said they ' just did nâ€™t have time ' to look up or ask for information			1
while 85 per cent used the internet to find their information , only 23 per cent asked for the help of a professional such as a vet			0
@entity112 , @entity113 for @entity45 , the pheromone calming product for dogs , said : ' it 's clear from the research that owners are simply not equipping themselves with all the information necessary to bring up a puppy in a harmonious , healthy environment			2
' for example , a quarter dealt with bad behaviour simply by shouting which can result in problematic behaviour as the puppy matures			0
' puppy - dog eyes : they made be adorable , but pets are a huge amount of work and responsibility @entity45 is warning potential puppy owners to be cautious when deciding to get a puppy , and ensure they leave themselves as much time as possible to do their research and make their decision			1
@entity112 continued : ' getting a puppy can completely transform your life and it 's important to be aware of the changes it will cause			0
' it is often compared to having a toddler in the house , and if you and your home are unprepared the situation can become extremely stressful			0
sleepless nights , toilet training and behaviour problems - it 's important to be prepared for them all ! ' first of all investigate all the possible costs a new puppy may incur - ask yourself , can you afford it ? ' make sure you seek professional advice either from the @entity163 , or your local vet so you are ready to train and socialise your puppy			2
' fully puppy - proof your home in the same way you would prepare for a new baby , and make sure you have invested in the right bed , collar , toys and food			0
