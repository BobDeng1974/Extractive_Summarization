this is officially my start to the season			1
back to work , picking my 10 players for @entity5 ... and then watching to see how they fare through the campaign			1
some of these picks are obvious because they are big - money buys but i hope you will agree there are some surprise names , too			1
there is n’t a @entity15 player but that ’s because there is no mystery about their squad			1
leave a comment below and let me know your players to watch			1
enjoy the season ! no 1 : @entity25 @entity27 fans might tell you they did n’t expect to see another fast winger type coming in but you ca n’t ignore the chance to sign the electrifying @entity31			1
@entity25 is the most exciting signing of the summer so far and i hope he settles quickly			2
he played wide for @entity34 but still has a very good goal return ( 39 goals in 88 league games )			2
when you play with @entity38 , you wo n’t get much of the central ground but i expect to see more of him through the middle in the @entity42			1
wherever he plays , his unbelievable pace will hurt defenders			2
expect to see him on the ball often and opening up his body to dribble at pace			2
click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week … @entity55 's top picks including goals from @entity57 and @entity58 stellar signing : @entity25 brings pace , trickery and menace to @entity27 's forward line			1
watch out ! the leader of the pack : @entity25 gives @entity27 an extra dimension and should become a huge hit with fans no 2 : @entity69 @entity70 have spent a long time trying to replace @entity71 and now they have found their man			1
i call him a ‘ ticker ’ ... he gets it and he gives it and he keeps the team ticking along , just like his compatriots @entity78 and @entity79			2
he can hit a long pass too but most of his work will be pass - and - move in the middle of the park			1
one fault is that he does n’t score enough goals and @entity70 need more from that area of the pitch			2
the new @entity91 : @entity69 will keep things ticking over in midfield , but he needs to add goals to his game keeping things moving : @entity97 should be a great addition in the engine room of @entity70 's midfield no 3 : @entity101 a replacement for @entity103 or will they play together at @entity105 ? they have looked the part in pre-season			2
both are powerful and @entity101 will score goals			2
i ’ve liked the @entity112 for a long time and as he was free he ’s an absolute bargain when you see clubs like @entity117 scratching around for a forward			2
solid signing : @entity101 ( left ) looks the part in pre-season and could be an absolute steal for @entity105 no 4 : @entity122 i expect this brilliant kid to be another player @entity124 will be chasing in a year or two			2
he is an explosive little powerhouse , a mighty mouse of an attacking player who is as strong as an ox			2
i am told he has returned to training at @entity130 looking hungry and sharp and that he is bulking up			2
no @entity132 fatigue for him			2
we are used to a winger being easy to bully but it looks as if defenders will hurt themselves trying to kick this 19 - year - old			1
@entity130 will have to change the way they play after losing @entity139 and so @entity122 could be used behind @entity140 or playing either right or left of him			0
one of his many qualities is that you just can not predict where he will be playing when the @entity130 teamsheet arrives , which gives @entity147 the valuable element of surprise			0
he draws penalties and free kicks because he gets in and around defenders , under their arms and is great at protecting the ball			0
@entity122 is lightning quick , too , but needs to score more goals			0
the challenge will be for him to hit double figures as he continues his rapid rise			0
powerful : @entity122 packs a punch despite his diminutive 5ft 7in stature trickery : @entity122 's wizardry with the ball is jaw - dropping at times , but he must score more goals no 5 : @entity58 there is a lot of doom and gloom around @entity172 because of the exodus of so many players , including captain @entity175			1
but having such big boots to fill presents a real chance for this lad to shine			1
this @entity179 - born 19 - year - old is a set - piece wizard and an all - action midfielder who i can see breaking into the senior @entity183 set - up before the end of the season			1
he ’s got an engine , gets around the pitch and starts the season after a successful summer tournament in @entity191 for @entity183 ’s @entity193 team			1
his free kick against @entity195 was named goal of the tournament and he was voted the event ’s third best player			0
i am expecting a lot from him			0
@entity202 determination : @entity58 has the opportunity to make a real name for himself at @entity172 @entity205 , bright future : @entity207 is a dead - ball expert and could be on the path for a full - @entity183 call - up no 6 : @entity57 my sources from the @entity214 training ground are raving about this powerhouse centre forward and how he is gearing up for the new season			1
it sounds like he was born to be a @entity219 player			0
he looks like a @entity221 villain , he is aggressive and will use every trick in the book to gain an advantage			0
watch him wrestling with defenders in the area , pulling and scratching and diving to win penalties			1
@entity219 will love him , defenders will hate playing against him ! he is a finisher — and i fancy him to settle quickly and score plenty			0
he is a strong boy who will fit into @entity214 ’s preferred system of playing one up			0
on the scoresheet : @entity57 will add muscle - and goals - to @entity214 's front line = all - action : @entity57 can be aggressive and will do anything to gain an advantage no 7 : @entity241 my dad , @entity242 , rang me to say : ‘ i ’ve got a chance of signing @entity241 for @entity246 ’			1
i like @entity247 , and loved him as a player but i was uncertain			0
after his illustrious @entity70 career , i expected him to glide off into the tv studio or to chase other business interests			0
@entity253 said : ‘ i ’ve looked him in the eyes and he wants to play			0
’ he has n’t gone for the money , that ’s for sure , as he is not the highest paid player at @entity246 , but he ’s in this list because i ’m excited to see how it works out for him			1
he will be defending differently from his time at @entity70 and he has put himself under pressure with this move but he looks in excellent shape in preseason			0
the small pitch at @entity246 might help him and having @entity268 next to him certainly will			0
moving on : @entity241 opted to play for @entity246 rather than retire into the sunset key signing : @entity241 adds a wealth of experience to @entity246 and could be all set for a swansong no 8 : @entity274 the @entity276 striker is raw but he has lots of ability			0
now we ’ll see if he can he handle the step up from the @entity281 , where he scored 27 goals in 64 starts			0
@entity274 has also made his mark with the @entity287 team with two in four games and was the @entity289 of the season			1
he wo n’t get as many chances in the top flight but he is a strong spearhead for @entity295 ’s team			1
i ’m also convinced that @entity274 and @entity297 , @entity276 ’s very talented right back , can make the breakthrough with @entity183			0
they are bright young talents ready to step up			0
step up : @entity274 is in the @entity42 on the back of an impressive scoring record in the championship rising star : @entity274 has also made a name for himself on the international scene with @entity287 no 9 : @entity307 the £ 28million @entity308 paid for a player @entity219 does n’t fancy is huge , especially considering @entity310 left him on the bench as an impact substitute for much of the @entity132			1
there are times when @entity307 looks like the next @entity315 with his brutal power and then there are moments when he looks as if he could n’t trap a bag of cement			0
he still has a bit to prove and he needs to repay the faith shown in him by @entity323 and @entity324			0
he ’s no longer a loan player doing someone a favour , as he was at @entity328 and @entity308 in the past two seasons			0
at the very least he must match his return of 15 goals last season			1
staying put : @entity307 penned a deal with @entity308 after a successful loan spell last season fans ' favourite : the @entity308 faithful will have been delighted with @entity307 's signing and the statement it makes no 10 : @entity341 you may consider him an odd choice , but the @entity345 player who endured a terrible opening season in @entity348 football , is a wonderful talent			1
i am told he is looking sharp in training and , while there is a lot of competition on the right side for @entity345 — @entity356 and @entity357 are also competing for a place — he could get the nod or feature through the middle			0
he cost £ 30m and you have to ask how @entity363 , @entity345 ’ director of football , believed him to be worth that			0
but with a fellow @entity366 as his new manager , we could see him emerge			0
second season syndrome : @entity341 has looked sharp in pre-season and hopes are high price tag : @entity341 joined from @entity373 for £ 30m last season after being the top scorer in @entity376 @entity377 wants belief from players			1

the @entity42 season is just around the corner so here are the top ten players to look out for
from big - money buys to canny @entity388 signings there are some obvious players - and some surprises too
there are no @entity15 signings as there is no mystery to their squad
