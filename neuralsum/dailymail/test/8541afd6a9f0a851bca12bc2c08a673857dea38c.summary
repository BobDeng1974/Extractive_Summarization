commonplace they may be , but there 's nothing ordinary about camellias			1
polished evergreen foliage provides a great contrast with brightly coloured flowers and brings life to dull winter gardens			1
and when the flowers open their ' ­ alabaster petals ' — as the novelist @entity12 put it — camellias are positively regal			1
they are easy to grow , but picky about soil			1
if yours is acid , free - draining and nutritious , they 'll thrive , but they mope in alkaline or neutral ground			1
so , if your soil does n't suit , plant in containers in ericaceous compost			1
the polished evergreen foliage of @entity26 makes for a great contrast to the brightly coloured flowers camellias are amazingly versatile			1
you can give them free rein or prune to keep them compact			1
i 've seen them trained on walls , bent over arches and even grown as hedging			2
tender kinds such as @entity38 make outstanding conservatory plants			2
camellias are happy in sun or shade and grow as readily among other shrubs as in isolation			1
though frost will damage open flowers , the buds and plants of most are bone hardy			1
and unlike other spring shrubs , camellias stagger their flowering over a long time			1
perfect for pots potted camellias wo n't last as long as those in the ground			1
they tend to lose their youthful charm after five or six years , but are not difficult to propagate			2
if you do n't want to buy new , take root cuttings and bring them on as replacements			0
the best time to take cuttings is between september and february , but you can try it now			0
select healthy young shoots for leaf bud cuttings			0
snip out sections , each with a single leaf and a little bud by the leaf stalk			0
sever each stem just above that bud and again an inch below the leaf			0
put the cutting in a mix of potting compost and grit or @entity79 and place in a cold frame or propagator			0
this is also a good time to buy camellia plants			0
you can see them in flower , select your favourites and enjoy this year 's display			0
the choice is vast , with 250 wild species and hundreds more garden varieties			0
camellia japonica — native to cooler regions of @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 — has given rise to the hardiest and prettiest			0
i grow sumptuous red semidouble @entity101 and single white @entity103 , which thrive in containers in our bracing @entity106 climate			2
the @entity109 hybrids are also gorgeous			0
developed in the @entity111 , the former owner of @entity113 in @entity114 , they have a greatly extended flowering season			0
i grow the first - named of his progeny , @entity118			1
if the weather is mild , the single pink flowers appear in midwinter and continue until april			2
@entity122 and @entity123 you may not have heard of @entity118 , but you 're likely to know @entity125 , @entity127 's most popular @entity26 variety			1
the semi-double , subtly veined pink flowers have a translucent alabaster gleam and it never stints on flower numbers			2
if your soil is borderline acid , @entity109 camellias , such as @entity125 , seem to do best			1
each spring , work sulphur powder into the ground round the plants at 200g per square metre to boost acidity			0
and feed camellias — as well as other lime - haters — with chelated iron tonic			1
otherwise , problems are few			0
premature bud drop is caused by lack of water in summer , so keep the potting compost moist			0
yellowing foliage signals a magnesium deficiency , but you can cure that with @entity153 salts			2
dissolve 20g per litre of water and sprinkle on the leaves and the ground around the plant			0
if , in mid-spring , your bush is disfigured by too many dead flowers , grab the main stems and give them an energetic shake			2
a storm of dead petals and debris will fly in all directions — but the buds will be unharmed and a glorious new display will be imminent .			0

the @entity26 evergreen foliage provides a contrast to the bright flowers
they are easy to grow and like acid , free - draining and nutritious soil
camellias are happy in sun or shade and grow readily among other shrubs
