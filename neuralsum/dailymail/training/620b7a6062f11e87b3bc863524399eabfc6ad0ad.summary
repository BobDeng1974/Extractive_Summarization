by @entity0 they have been trapped in the depths of eastern @entity3 since christmas morning as every rescue mission so far has failed			0
but pictures sent from @entity7 's @entity6 show the 74 people on board are not letting the setback get them down			0
captured throwing snowballs , playing with penguins and gliding around the five - metre - deep ice sheets , the passengers and researchers claim they are more than content with being marooned in the coldest part of the world			2
the crew called for help at 5am on christmas day after their vessel became surrounded by ice sheets			1
she is pictured stretching and playing on the deck passengers waved as a helicopter sent from @entity41 's retreated @entity40 flew by to check the snow levels yesterday the researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well - stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of @entity50 capital @entity48 a top - of - the - range @entity41 icebreaker , the @entity40 ( ' @entity53 ' ) , was deployed but it too got stuck at just six nautical miles from the ship			1
yesterday , @entity34 's back - up ship @entity55 took charge of the rescue mission , with hopes to arrive this evening			1
however , the rescue team have warned they may need another fall - back as the vessel , which can crack up to 1.35 metres of ice , may not be strong enough to break through			1
the captain of the @entity65 , @entity66 , said his ship was always ' option b '			0
the @entity40 , which will remain on standby , has a helicopter on board that can be used to rescue passengers if the @entity55 can not break through the ice , said @entity73 spokesman @entity72			1
' the @entity55 is expected to arrive at the scene sunday evening			1
it 's pretty slow going out there , ' ms @entity72 said			0
the third icebreaker , a @entity80 - flagged ship , is no longer involved in the rescue			2
failed : this picture , tweeted by passenger @entity82 , shows the top - of - the - range icebreaker , @entity41 's ' @entity40 ' which also got stuck and was forced to retreat on friday trapped : 74 people , including scientists , tourists and a @entity89 reporter , are stuck in thick ice sheets crew members routinely check the hull of the ship , which gathers fresh layers of snow every night the @entity6 set off from @entity96 on november 28 to recreate a 100 - year - old @entity98 expedition first sailed by sir @entity99 to see how the journey changes using new technology and equipment			1
but on wednesday morning , the boat hit a mass of thick ice sheets and today remains at a stand still			1
@entity82 , an @entity34 professor who helped organise the voyage on the @entity7 ship , yesterday posted a photograph on @entity109 apparently showing the @entity41 vessel , a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice			1
' everyone well , ' @entity115 added			0
he said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be ' like driving your car into a brick wall '			2
just before 5am on wednesday , @entity34 deployed a @entity119 to free the group into open water			2
@entity80 vessel @entity122 was sent out for back up , alongside @entity34 's @entity55 , which is carrying food and first aid professionals			1
after two days being stranded , passengers hoped to be rescued by the @entity40 as it powered through horrific conditions			2
@entity7 's @entity6 is recreating @entity99 's 100 - year - old @entity98 expedition using new tools blizzards could hamper the rescue mission , but the ship is well - stocked and the scientists are continuing their research on the snow around them but on friday the heavy winds became too great , and built up an impenetrable pile of snow			1
@entity6 , an ice - strengthened ship built in 1982 , was originally used for oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a passenger vessel in the @entity142 and @entity3			2
marooned 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity48 - the capital of the @entity34 state of @entity50 - the thick ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind			1
the @entity7 embassy in @entity34 has been in constant contact with the captain and said everyone on board was in good health and there was ' no threat to their lives or safety '			2
on board are scientists from the @entity161 , a journalist from @entity89 and dozens of tourists who have paid to be part of the recreation of @entity99 â€™s expedition			0
the research team has made contact with local stations from the @entity170 to say they are well - stocked with food			0
the ship had been on a multi-day tour from @entity96 to visit several sites along the edge of @entity3 before getting trapped in sea ice @entity80 's @entity177 , also deployed to save the ship , has now turned back bleak : the ship has been stranded in the barren , frozen landscape since @entity181 ' we all know that there 's a possibility of this becoming quite a protracted sit and wait , ' said @entity187 , a passenger onboard the @entity188 , speaking via satellite phone			1
' i think people are just looking at that next step when that second icebreaker arrives			0
' we really are just hoping that the two powerful icebreaker ships will provide the breakage of ice that we need			0
' however , he said the ice floes appear to have built up dramatically overnight			0
they are also continuing their research while stranded by testing the temperature of the surrounding ice sheets			0
a spokesman for @entity34 's @entity73 told @entity34 's @entity204 : ' it is quite a remote part of the world , but we have everyone safe			1
the vessel is n't in any immediate danger			0
