by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 11:36 est , 25 january 2013 when i was 16 and had my first proper boyfriend , @entity3 , my dad drove me to a weekend sleepover party out in the @entity6 countryside , some 200 miles away			1
the other girls were out walking when we arrived , so we sat in the twilight under the gum trees and he built a fire while we waited			1
@entity12 kept prodding the flames and i could see he had something on his mind — probably the enormous love bites @entity3 had branded on my neck			1
when he finally spoke , it was to dole out the best advice i ever received			1
@entity0 said her father @entity20 , pictured together in 2006 , shaped her belief in herself and gave her the confidence to pursue a career in @entity24 he said i had to make my own decisions , but that my body was precious and should not be handed over casually			1
he told me that unless a girl respected herself , no boy or man would ever respect her			1
i told him that lots of the girls were sleeping with their boyfriends and he replied : ‘ @entity34 , you are not just any girl			1
’ that was pretty much his mantra			1
he told me i was beautiful , when a blind man could see i was n’t			1
he told me i was clever and could do anything if i set my mind to it , even though there were far smarter girls than me at school			1
he told me i was equal to any person , boy or girl , rich or poor , and the only limits in my life would be the ones i set myself			1
i believed him , and his words moulded my character and changed the course of my life — for there is no more formative relationship for a woman than the one she has with her father			1
it defines our view of men , and of ourselves			1
i could n’t help but remember @entity12 ’s inspirational pep talks this week , as i read the @entity63 ’s serialisation of psychologist @entity65 ’s new book , @entity66			2
@entity0 said her father 's belief means she will walk out of a relationship if a man does not treat her well enough he argues that a father ’s love will set up his daughter for life , and claims that if fathers fail to raise their daughters properly , they will be cast adrift in the modern world — a world where girls are vulnerable to unhappiness , stress , abusive relationships , drugs and teenage pregnancy			1
my own dad somehow instinctively knew all this			2
he knew that a girl ’s self - respect and self - esteem comes from her father ’s love			1
he showered me with affection , taught me to be independent and encouraged me to be as boisterous as my brothers , @entity94 and @entity95			2
in short , he was the perfect father			1
yet , while @entity65 was correct to point out the terrible effects of bad fathers on girls , he neglected to mention the downside of having a wonderful dad — that a girl can spend the rest of her life searching in vain for a man who measures up to him			1
@entity106 , 55 years old and single ( but dating ) should know			2
the man i married ( and then divorced ) , and the two men i was engaged to , all disappointed me : by not treating me as well as my dad treats my mum , and has always treated me			2
@entity65 says that if a father asks for and listens to his daughter ’s views and opinions from an early age , she ’ll develop the sense that she ’s both intelligent and worthwhile			1
@entity12 always asked me what i thought about things			2
if i ever gave the grumpy teenage response ‘ who cares ? ’ he would tell me to use my brain , not to be lazy			1
that was a sin in our house			2
it was also my dad who gave me the self - confidence not to settle for second best when it came to men			1
so when i found my husband was cheating on me , just a few years after our wedding , i had no qualms about divorcing him			2
i was a self - reliant , successful journalist by this point — another thing which can be traced back to my dad			2
when i was about ten , @entity140 went back to work to help with our school fees			2
it was clear we were struggling financially			2
squeezed between my two burly brothers in the back of the car , i said i could move to the local school as it did n’t matter what education i got , i ’d just get married and some man would look after me			2
i ’ve never seen my father so angry			1
he slammed the brakes and said : ‘ never , ever say that again			2
you are equal to the boys in every way			2
’ those words were seared on to my conscience and i remembered them many times as i carved out a career on male - dominated @entity24 in the @entity161			1
yet while i love my career , earning my own living and being independent , i ’m sure this has made some men i ’ve dated feel insecure			1
it was n’t that i did n’t need them , it ’s just that they did n’t feel i did			0
add to this the financial security a career has given me , and it ’s little wonder that i ’ve left relationships when the men i was involved with did n’t treat me as well as my father did — with constant courtesy , love , respect and playfulness			1
my dad taught me that romance is important and costs nothing			0
he would often arrive home with a bunch of roses for @entity140 that he ’d picked from our neighbour ’s gardens on his way back from the bus stop			0
he ’ll turn 87 this year , and mum 85 — yet he still says she ’s the most wonderful and beautiful woman in the world			0
he does n’t see the wrinkles , just laughter lines			0
‘ it ’s in her eyes , ’ he still says , ‘ that ’s where beauty lies			0
’ when i was growing up , my dad always insisted that the way a boy dresses is a sign of his respect for you			0
pity the poor hapless chap who turned up at our front door in surf shorts and a vest to take me out and was told to come back when he was dressed properly			0
my father never raised his hand to my mother , nor his voice , and thereby set a standard by which i would judge other men			1
about a year into a relationship at university , a boyfriend of mine got drunk , became abusive and called me a ‘ f * * * ing bitch ’ , among other things			0
of course , he was sorry afterwards , but i knew from what @entity12 had taught me that it was wrong and that the relationship had to end			0
if he did n’t respect me , how could i respect myself ? this was a message @entity12 had hammered home to me frequently during my teenage years			0
on one memorable trip , he got hold of a campervan and the two of us travelled south to beautiful beaches , listening to @entity233 and @entity234 , chatting away in the car about everything and nothing — but mostly about boys			0
it was on one of these trips , sitting outside in the campsite heating up a tin of braised steak and onions over an open fire , that i told him my boyfriend , @entity247 , was going to dump me if i did n’t have sex with him			0
i told him i did n’t feel ready and we talked about that			0
@entity12 reminded me again that my body was precious			0
he told me that if @entity247 really loved me he would wait			0
@entity0 parents @entity20 and @entity254 meeting @entity255 in @entity256 , @entity6			1
she said her father still says his wife is the most beautiful woman in the world i thought of @entity12 ’s wise advice again when i read @entity65 warning that many fathers distance themselves from their daughters when they reach puberty , handing responsibility for girls ’ emotional well - being to their mothers			1
that ’s a mistake my dad never made and they were the years that truly cemented our relationship			0
while he was open with his emotions when i was growing up , my dad is a real man ’s man			0
i have only ever seen him cry three times : when his mother died , when my brother died , and in the car on the way to my wedding			0
on that day , they were not tears of sadness but of passage			0
he knew he was handing over his beloved daughter to another man and an uncertain future			0
even when my marriage failed , my father was a constant source of comfort			1
he never lectured me — he only offered words of consolation			0
as an adult , i ’ve stayed incredibly close to @entity12 , despite living on the other side of the world			0
some men i ’ve been with — mostly the insecure ones — resent the closeness we still have , as if they must be the only man in my life			0
having such a great dad may have been a hindrance to my romantic happiness — but the other thing @entity12 taught me is optimism			0
that the glass is n’t just half full , it ’s overflowing			0
and that ’s how i see the future			0
i have n’t found mr @entity312 yet , and am reluctant to settle for mr @entity313 , but i ’m still looking and hoping			0
