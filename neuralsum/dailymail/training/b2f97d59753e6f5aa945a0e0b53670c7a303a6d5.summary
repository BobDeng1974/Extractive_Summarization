furious fish shop owners have slammed a council after it spent £ 3,000 of taxpayers ' cash on a guide on how to make their chips			1
the six - page document goes into minute detail on how thick each chip should be , as well as recommending exact temperatures for frying and informing workers that fries should be ' golden ' in colour			1
chippie owners criticised @entity16 bureaucrats for the guide , calling it patronising and unnecessary			1
a council spent £ 3,000 on the guides on how to cook chips , which advises chippie owners to cut chips to at least 14mm , slightly more than half an inch , in width @entity26 owners are advised that chips should be served when they are a ' pale , golden colour ' the detailed document , written by the @entity30 , explains to workers how they can ' make the food they serve healthier ' while saving money			1
the initiative , launched by @entity36 's local authority , then explains that the best chips are made ' using a cutter with at least a 14mm ( just more than half an inch ) cross section '			1
chip shop workers are then told to heat their fryer to 175c before putting potatoes in , cooking them for 5 - 6 minutes until they are a ' pale , golden colour '			1
despite the lengthy description on how long a chip should be cooked for - 5 - 6 minutes - the guide says it is sometimes better just to follow instructions on the packet			1
the guidance reads : ' frozen chips may only take 2 - 3 minutes – businesses should follow the manufacturer ’s instructions			1
' they should also make sure they wash their fryers and change their oil often			0
the council document also suggests using rapeseed or sunflower oils , which are ' high oleic ' - or high in unsaturated fats			1
the guide also recommends using salt shakers with fewer holes in and asking customers whether they want salt on their fries			1
@entity70 , who owns @entity71 in @entity36 , said : ' if you 've been in the business like me since 1980 you do n't need to be told how to do chips			2
' some people might need telling , but i do n't need them telling me what to do			0
' chips tips : banging and shaking chips before serving them can reduce oil for customers , the advice says chips should be fried on their own to ensure oil quality is not affected , according to the document the document also advises on the correct oils to be used to fry chips , suggesting ' high oleic ' oils the six - page document , branded as patronising by chip shop workers , suggests using salt shakers with fewer holes and asking customers whether they want salt @entity99 , 28 , who owns @entity100 in the @entity102 town , said : ' we try really hard to make sure we know these things anyway			1
' we have our food nutritionally tested so for us this would not be a good experience for us			0
' i would go to the @entity109 for advice and not the council			2
they could n't tell us anything			0
there is nothing they could tell us that we do n't already know			0
' @entity117 has allocated £ 40,000 to @entity16 to fund health improvement schemes in 2013/14 and 2014/15			0
the guide says : ' by shaking the chips and banging the wire scoop several times , you can reduce fat absorption by 20 % and make your chips crisper			1
' this is because chips carry on absorbing fat after they come out of the fryer			2
' if you bang and shake you ’ll use less oil , need to top up less often , and need to empty the drain in the chip box less often			2
' just over £ 20,000 has been awarded to five projects in the town this year - including the so - called ' healthy chip ' scheme , which costs £ 3,000			1
it is hoped that the scheme will help reduce the amount of oil absorbed into deep fried foods , consequently reducing obesity levels in low - income areas			2
a spokesman for the @entity146 branded the guide a ' ludicrous ' move			0
he said : ' when we 're trying to make savings it beggars belief the council is doing takeaway training			0
' the idea that it 's appropriate to spend taxpayers ' money telling chip shop owners how to cut chips is just ludicrous			1
' they must think again - even the beneficiaries of this bizarre scheme do n't seem particularly keen on it			0
' if the @entity16 wants people in low - income areas to be able to buy healthier , but often more expensive , food it should think about cutting council tax			2
' @entity170 , owner of @entity100 in @entity36 , said the council could not tell him anything he did not already know chips should be served when they are a ' pale , golden colour ' , the document says ( file picture ) but councillor @entity177 , cabinet member for healthy lifestyles on @entity16 , defended the policy			1
she said : ' the project is about encouraging and supporting takeaways in low - income communities to serve healthier food			2
' its aim is to encourage small takeaway businesses to implement simple procedural changes to the way they fry food so as to produce a healthier product			0
' we want to actively encourage healthier eating in any community in order to reduce obesity and long term illness and this project will help in doing this			0
' according to the guidance , shops should use liquid oils , such as sunflower and rapeseed , heated to @entity205 before each batch , for ' crispier , more appealing chips '			1
the document 's advice on cutting down on salt reads : ' lots of people are trying to cut down on the amount of salt they eat			2
you can help your customers to do this by doing these things			0
' use a salt shaker with fewer holes – just ask your supplier if they provide five - hole tops			1
' ask your customers if they want salt before adding it			0
' do n’t add salt to batter mix. if you buy batter mix , check the ingredients and try to choose one that does n’t contain salt or sodium			0
' read the label on foods like sauces , sausages and pies and choose the one with less salt ( or it might say ‘ sodium ’ )			0
if there ’s no information on salt , ask your supplier			0
' the advice on cooking healthy chips was also condensed into a two - page document , pictured here researchers claim the oil is essential when it comes to frying and it should be sieved and reheated at the end of every batch			1
the guide adds that ' the ratio of food to oil should be 1:6 ' and ' baskets should n't look more than half full '			2
research suggests that most retailers complete a full oil change every 2 - 4 weeks , but this should actually be done after 20 frying hours , it explains			0
chips must be cooked in a fryer without any other food contact and the chef should shake them and bang them with a wire scoop several times after cooking			2
research suggests this simple movement can reduce fat absorption by 20 per cent , making the chips crisper			0
they are also advised to offer smaller portion sizes , ' for people with smaller appetites ' .			0
